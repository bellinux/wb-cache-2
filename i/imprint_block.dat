He used this to create white relief effects for clouds and for highlights on water or plants. This {{was a relatively}} new process, having been invented by Hu's contemporary Wu Faxiang, {{who was also a}} Nanjing-based publisher. Wu had used this technique {{for the first time in}} his book Wisteria Studio Letter Paper (Luoxuan Biangu Jianpu, [...] ), published in 1626. Both Hu and Wu used embossing to create decorative writing papers, the sale of which provided a sideline income for the Ten Bamboo Studio.|$|R

40|$|This paper reviews {{a series}} of {{experiments}} designed to investigate whether features characteristic for associative learning are also true of filial <b>imprinting.</b> Phenomena resembling <b>blocking</b> and overshadowing in associative learning may occur during imprinting on two different objects, but {{it is unlikely that}} the underlying mechanisms are similar to those in associative learning. Potentiation, a phenomenon the converse of overshadowing, was found in experiments on learning about two features of one imprinting object. This result can be explained in an associative way, but differential levels of arousal or attention are also possible explanations. It is concluded that filial imprinting and associative learning are not one and the same process, although they possibly share one or more subprocesses...|$|R
40|$|During {{development}} primary afferents {{grow into}} and establish neuronal {{connections in the}} spinal cord, conveying information of the anatomical and mechanical properties of the body. This body representation forms the basis for how we perceive sensory information and control our movements. Subsequently, {{the strength of the}} sensory input to spinal sensorimotor circuits is functionally adjusted by an experience dependent mechanism termed somatosensory imprinting. In this learning, tactile feedback on spontaneous movements {{play a key role in}} setting the strength of nociceptive input. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying this learning and the resulting action-based body representation has hitherto not been clear. Of particular interest was to clarify if structural plasticity is involved in somatosensory imprinting. In sharp contrast to the prevailing view of an innate body representation, a transitory floating organization was found in the neonate, subsequently undergoing profound reorganization through gradual establishment of new connections and elimination of erroneous axonal arbours. In this process, afferent fibres carrying different modalities seem to follow each other into the dorsal horn and terminate in close proximity during the first postnatal weeks. The final termination pattern of thin fibres depends on activity in tactile fibres, as disturbing the tactile input profoundly affects not only tactile terminations but also those of thin fibres, indicating cross-modality interactions. Importantly, these structural changes occur in parallel to the functional adaptation by somatosensory <b>imprinting.</b> <b>Blocking</b> NMDA receptors during this time period freeze the juvenile termination pattern and abolish functional reflex tuning, demonstrating for the first time that somatosensory imprinting is NMDA dependent. A variance analysis provided additional support for the notion that differences in strength between adult afferent connections to spinal sensorimotor circuits are due to differences in the number of connections rather than heterogeneity in gain between individual connections. NMDA receptors were also shown to set the gain in these circuits as well as in ascending nociceptive pathways to the primary somatosensory cortex. In conclusion, this thesis reveals that the spinal cord undergoes substantial activity dependent structural changes during development and suggests that these changes play a key role in somatosensory imprinting. We also show that NMDA receptors are important for gain regulation in the adult, both in spinal sensorimotor circuits as well as in ascending sensory processing to the somatosensory cortex. Thus, far from being inborn and stereotypic, the dorsal horn of the spinal cord should be regarded as a highly adaptive body-brain interface undergoing substantial experience dependent structural adaptation to the body anatomy and movement patterns...|$|R

Wallace† A reduced order model for off-wall {{boundary conditions}} for turbulent flows is proposed. The model circumvents {{the need to}} resolve the buffer layer near the wall by providing conditions directly above it for the overlying flow. The effect of the buffer layer is modeled as a pattern of periodic blocks similar to the minimal unit of Jiménez & Moin (1991). The model is reduced to the <b>imprint</b> of such <b>blocks</b> on a plane at y + ≈ 100, at which Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed {{for the rest of}} the flow. The blocks are constructed from the transitional direct simulation of Sayadi et al. (2012). The block sizes are selected so that they are statistically representative of fully turbulent flow, and so that they contain the dominant structures at y + ≈ 100, as educed from direct mode decomposition. The model has the form of a collection of Fourier modes in space and time, and comprises ∼ 1 % of the parameters necessary to describe the full flow field at the plane considered, while it reproduces ∼ 90 % of the amplitudes of the flow statistics. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this thesis contributes {{to the development of}} new strategies facilitating advanced understanding of the fundamental principles governing selective recognition of molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) at a molecular level for the rational optimization of biomimetic materials. The nature of non-covalent interactions involved in the templating process of molecularly imprinted polymers based on the self-assembly approach were investigated with a variety of analytical techniques addressing molecular level interactions. For this purpose, the concerted application of IR and 1 H-NMR spectroscopy enabled studying the complexation of the template molecules 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, quercetin, and o-, m-, and p-nitrophenol with a variety of functional monomers in the pre-polymerization solution by systematically varying the ratio of the involved components. In aqueous and non protic porogenic solvents, information on the interaction types, thermodynamics, and complex stoichiometry was applied toward predicting the optimum <b>imprinting</b> building <b>blocks</b> and ratios. Molecular dynamics simulations of 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and its interactions with the functional monomer 4 -vinylpyridine in aqueous and aprotic explicit solvent allowed demonstrating the fundamental potential of computer MD simulations for predicting optimized pre-polymerization ratios and the involved interaction types. The obtained results clearly demonstrate that the application of rapid IR/NMR pre-screening methods in combination with molecular modeling strategies is a promising strategy towards optimized imprinting protocols in lieu of the conventionally applied labor intensive and time-consuming trial-and-error approach. Furthermore, HPLC characterization of the produced MIPs compared to control polymers enabled a systematic approach to imprinting based on advanced understanding of the factors governing the formation of high-affinity binding sites during the polymerization. In addition, the importance of the combination of size, shape, and molecular functionalities for the selective recognition properties of MIPs was investigated. MIPs for the mycotoxins deoxynivalenol and zearalenone and for the antioxidant quercetin were applied as separation materials for advanced sample preparation in beverage analysis. The obtained results demonstrated the potential of MIPs for rapid one-step sample clean-up and pre-concentration from beverages such as wine and beer. Ph. D.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{proximal}} {{region of}} murine Chr 2 {{has long been}} known to harbour one or more imprinted genes from classic genetic studies involving reciprocal translocations. No imprinted gene had been identified from this region until our study demonstrated that the PcG gene Sfmbt 2 is expressed from the paternally inherited allele in early embryos and extraembryonic tissues. Imprinted genes generally reside in clusters near elements termed Imprinting Control Regions (ICRs), suggesting that Sfmbt 2 might represent an anchor for a new imprinted domain. Results We analyzed allelic expression of approximately 20 genes within a 3. 9 Mb domain and found that Sfmbt 2 and an overlapping non-coding antisense transcript are the only imprinted genes in this region. These transcripts represent a very narrow imprinted gene locus. We also demonstrate that rat Sfmbt 2 is imprinted in extraembryonic tissues. An interesting feature of both mouse and rat Sfmbt 2 genes is the presence of a large block of miRNAs in intron 10. Other mammals, including the bovine, lack this block of miRNAs. Consistent with this association, we show that human and bovine Sfmbt 2 are biallelic. Other evidence indicates that pig Sfmbt 2 is also not imprinted. Further strengthening the argument for recent evolution of Sfmbt 2 is our demonstration that a more distant muroid rodent, Peromyscus also lacks <b>imprinting</b> and the <b>block</b> of miRNAs. Conclusions These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the block of miRNAs are driving imprinting at this locus. Our results are discussed in the context of ncRNAs at other imprinted loci. Accession numbers for Peromyscus cDNA and intron 10 genomic DNA are [Genbank: HQ 416417 and Genbank: HQ 416418], respectively. </p...|$|R
