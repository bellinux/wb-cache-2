5|$|McBride's {{tenure as}} owner was viewed favorably, {{partly because of}} the Browns' on-field success but also because he gave Paul Brown a <b>free</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> coach and sign players.

5|$|Burston {{believed}} in personal reconnaissance and {{leading from the}} front. He was {{at the forefront of}} providing the medical arrangements for Operation Compass. He attempted, in the face of equipment shortages, to anticipate medical problems and so far as possible to prevent or avoid them. He dispatched Major Ian Murray Mackerras to investigate fly breeding in order to prevent an outbreak of diarrhoea. Burston gave Mackerras a <b>free</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> tackle hygiene problems.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Webb left Caedmon's Call {{to pursue}} a solo career. Since his departure, he has {{released}} seven studio albums (including one instrumental), a live album, two compilation albums, two covers projects, two DVDs, and two EPs (with his then-wife, Sandra McCracken). While these have been less commercially successful than his work with Caedmon's Call, Webb has had more of a <b>free</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> shape his work to his vision.|$|E

5|$|In Ong Ah Chuan and the {{subsequent}} decision Haw Tua Tau v. Public Prosecutor (1981), the Privy Council declined to set out a comprehensive list of fundamental rules of natural justice and merely stated some principles {{to deal with the}} issues at hand. At a 2000 conference, the Attorney-General Chan Sek Keong, who became Chief Justice in 2006, remarked that this gives the Court of Appeal a <b>free</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> determine the scope of the fundamental rules of natural justice unencumbered by precedent.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of its}} {{emancipation}} agenda, Seara expressed {{sympathy for}} the Romanian Jews, and, {{in contrast to the}} antisemitism of more traditionalist reviews, accepted works sent in by Jewish writers. In October 1913, Seara obtained and published a confidential order which gave Romanian Land Forces officers a <b>free</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> discriminate against Jewish recruits. In September 1914, it hosted the journalistic debut of Jewish avant-garde author Jacques G. Costin, who was, with Vinea, caretaker of the cultural pages. Like Arghezi and Vinea, Costin experimented with satirical genres, his sketch story techniques borrowed from 19th century classic Ion Luca Caragiale (Mateiu's father). Some of the poems published in Seara were authored by Arghezi's Jewish wife, Constanța Zissu. Seara was also receiving contributions from Grigore Goilav, the Armenian Romanian ethnographer and art historian.|$|E
5|$|Despite these successes, {{there was}} {{criticism}} of Dragoon by some Allied generals and contemporary commentators such as Bernard Montgomery, Arthur R. Wilson, and Chester Wilmot in the aftermath, {{mostly because of}} its geo-strategic implications. It was argued that Dragoon diverted highly-experienced men and much-needed material away from the continuing fighting at the Western front {{that could have been}} used, instead, to bolster the Italian front or to hasten the advance towards the Rhine by the Overlord forces. The resulting loss of momentum gave Stalin on the Eastern Front a <b>free</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> pursue his offensive efforts with more determination, allowing him to win the race towards Berlin and occupy the Balkans. Dragoon therefore had consequences reaching into the Cold War.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after taking}} office, McElroy formed a panel to {{investigate}} ABM issues. The panel examined the Army and Air Force projects, {{and found the}} Zeus program considerably more advanced than Wizard. McElroy told the Air Force to stop work on ABM missiles and use Wizard funding {{for the development of}} long-range radars for early warning and raid identification. These were already under development as the BMEWS network. The Army was handed the job of actually shooting down the warheads, and McElroy gave them <b>free</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> develop an ABM system as they saw fit, free of any range limitations.|$|E
5|$|In early May Cochrane was escorting {{a convoy}} from Cagliari to Leghorn. On 11May a ship {{which turned out}} to be the 6-gun {{privateer}} Intrépide was spotted capturing one of the merchant ships in the convoy, at which point Cochrane chased the Intrépide and forced her to surrender. Three days later, as the convoy passed the island of Montecristo, five rowing boats emerged from one of the island's coves and captured two of the rearmost merchant ships. Cochrane immediately gave chase, and recaptured them early the next morning. He was then given a <b>free</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> raid enemy shipping in the area, and captured seven or eight vessels that June and July, including the 10-gun privateer Asuncion off Bastia on 25June and the privateer Constitution off Caprea on 19 July. On 22September he captured a large Neapolitan vessel and, on bringing her into Port Mahon, discovered that the Spanish had taken notice of his depredations and were preparing a frigate to capture Speedy.|$|E
5|$|In the Islamic East, the Caliph {{was forced}} to {{acknowledge}} {{the reality of the}} Saffarids' domination and established a modus vivendi with them, perhaps hoping, according to Hugh Kennedy, to harness them in a partnership analogous to that which the Tahirids had enjoyed in previous decades. Consequently, the Saffarids were recognized in their possession of Khurasan and eastern Persia as well as Fars, while the Abbasids were to exercise direct control over western Persia, namely Jibal, Rayy and Isfahan. This policy gave the Caliph a <b>free</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> recover the territories of the Dulafids, another semi-independent local dynasty that was centred on Isfahan and Nihavand. When the Dulafid Ahmad ibn Abd al-Aziz ibn Abi Dulaf died in 893, al-Mu'tadid moved swiftly to install his son al-Muktafi as governor in Rayy, Qazvin, Qum and Hamadan. The Dulafids were confined to their core region around Karaj and Isfahan, before being deposed outright in 896. Nevertheless, the Abbasid hold over these territories remained precarious, especially due to the proximity of the Zaydi emirate in Tabaristan, and in 897 Rayy was handed over to Saffarid control.|$|E

50|$|In July 2007, Ahmadinejad {{ordered the}} {{dissolution}} of the Management and Planning Organisation of Iran, a relatively independent planning body with a supervisory role in addition to its responsibility to allocate the national budget, and replaced it with a new budget planning body directly under his control, a move that may give him a <b>freer</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> implement populist policies.|$|R
5|$|The {{struggle}} for power at the court had unfortunate consequences for both foreign affairs and for internal administration. All parties tried to satisfy the army {{in order to avoid}} interference in court affairs by leading commanders, and the military was given a <b>free</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> pursue ever larger conquests. As long as the Gorkhas were invading disunited hill states, this policy—or lack of policy—was adequate. Inevitably, continued aggression led Nepal into disastrous collisions with the Chinese and then with the British. At home, because power struggles centered on control of the king, there was little progress in sorting out procedures for sharing power or expanding representative institutions. A consultative body of nobles, a royal court called the Assembly of Lords (Bharadari Sabha), was in place after 1770 and it had substantial involvement in major policy issues. The assembly consisted of high government officials and leading courtiers, all heads of important Gorkha families. In the intense atmosphere surrounding the monarch, however, the Assembly of Lords broke into factions that fought for access to the prime minister or regent, and alliances developed around patron/client relationships.|$|E

25|$|In 1679, Freiburg {{temporarily}} became French territory, {{along with}} the southern parts of the upper Rhine. French King Louis XIV disliked the Austrian system and gave the Jesuits a <b>free</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> operate the university. On November 6, 1684, a bilingual educational program was initiated.

It is important, before attempting to breastfeed in a carrier, to first master the art of breastfeeding without a carrier.

25|$|The Treaties of Breslau and Berlin {{cost the}} Habsburg Monarchy its wealthiest province, and capitulating {{to a lesser}} German prince {{significantly}} dented the House of Habsburg's prestige. However, peace in the Silesian theater gave the united Austrian and British–Hanoverian forces a <b>free</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> reverse the gains made by the French and Bavarians in 1741. By the summer of 1743, the Austrians would recover control of Bohemia, drive the French back across the Rhine into Alsace, and occupy Bavaria, exiling the Bavarian Elector (now crowned Holy Roman Emperor Charles VII) to Frankfurt.|$|E
25|$|Sultan Selim III (reigned 1789–1807) had {{recognized}} the need to reform and modernize the Ottoman Empire, specifically the military, along European lines to ensure that his state could compete. Selim III, however, faced stiff local opposition from an entrenched clergy and military apparatus, especially from the Janissaries, the Ottoman infantry formed from the devshirme system. Consequently, Selim III was deposed and ultimately killed in 1808. Muhammad Ali, too, {{recognized the need}} to modernize, and unlike Selim, he had dispatched his chief rivals, giving him a <b>free</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> attempt reforms similar to those first begun by Selim III.|$|E
25|$|The Geneva {{agreement}} also {{stipulated that}} general elections {{should be held}} in Cambodia during 1955 and that the International Control Commission should monitor them to ensure fairness. Sihanouk was more determined than ever to defeat the Democrats (who, {{on the basis of}} their past record, were expected to win the election). The king attempted unsuccessfully to have the constitution amended. On March 2, 1955, he announced his abdication in favor of his father, Norodom Suramarit. Assuming the title of samdech (prince), Sihanouk explained that this action was necessary in order to give him a <b>free</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> engage in politics.|$|E

50|$|Led by {{a council}} of seven magistrates, the Supreme Electoral Council (CSE) is the co-equal branch of {{government}} responsible for organizing and conducting elections, plebiscites, and referendums. The magistrates and their alternates are elected to 5-year terms by the National Assembly. Constitutional changes in 2000 expanded the number of CSE magistrates from five to seven and gave the PLC and the FSLN a <b>freer</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> name party activists to the council, prompting allegations that both parties were politicizing electoral institutions and processes and excluding smaller political parties.|$|R
