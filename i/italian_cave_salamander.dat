50|$|Speleomantes strinatii, the French cave {{salamander}}, North-west <b>Italian</b> <b>cave</b> <b>salamander,</b> or Strinati's cave salamander. {{is a small}} (10-12.5cm long) {{species of}} salamander found in north-west Italy and south-east France.

50|$|The <b>Italian</b> <b>cave</b> <b>{{salamander}}</b> (Speleomantes italicus) is {{a species}} of salamander in the family Plethodontidae. Endemic to Italy, its natural habitats are temperate forests, rocky areas, caves, and subterranean habitats (other than caves). It is threatened by habitat loss.|$|E
40|$|Relationships between {{species and}} their {{habitats}} {{are not always}} constant. Different processes may determine changes in species-habitat association: individuals may prefer different habitat typologies in different periods, {{or they may be}} forced to occupy a different habitat in order to follow the changing environment. The aim of our study was to assess whether <b>cave</b> <b>salamanders</b> change their habitat association pattern through the year, and to test whether such changes are determined by environmental changes or by changes in preferences. We monitored multiple caves in Central Italy through one year, and monthly measured biotic and abiotic features of microhabitat and recorded <b>Italian</b> <b>cave</b> <b>salamanders</b> distribution. We used mixed models and niche similarity tests to assess whether species-habitat relationships remain constant through the year. Microhabitat showed strong seasonal variation, with the highest variability in the superficial sectors. Salamanders were associated to relatively cold and humid sectors in summer, but not during winter. Such apparent shift in habitat preferences mostly occurred because the environmental gradient changed through the year, while individuals generally selected similar conditions. Nevertheless, juveniles were more tolerant to dry sectors during late winter, when food demand was highest. This suggests that tolerance for suboptimal abiotic conditions may change through time, depending on the required resources. Differences in habitat use are jointly determined by environmental variation through time, and by changes in the preferred habitat. The trade-offs between tolerance and resources requirement are major determinant of such variation...|$|R

50|$|The <b>Italian</b> <b>cave</b> <b>salamander</b> {{is usually}} found {{in areas of}} {{limestone}} rock, but sometimes in sandstone or ophiolitic areas. It is agile, climbing on cave walls and rocky outcrops. The female lays a small clutch of eggs in a crevice and these hatch by direct development into miniature salamanders.|$|E
50|$|Among {{animals is}} to be {{highlighted}} a wide reptiles' and amphibia's biodiversity: in the park have been found eight different species of snakes and in the obscurity of the old mines dwells the endemic Speleomantes strinatii, at first considered a subspecies of the <b>Italian</b> <b>cave</b> <b>salamander</b> and now a self-standing species.|$|E
5000|$|The International Union for the Conservation of Nature has {{assessed}} the <b>Italian</b> <b>cave</b> <b>salamander</b> as being [...] "near threatened".

50|$|The <b>Italian</b> <b>cave</b> <b>salamander</b> is {{native to}} {{northern}} Italy where it {{is found in the}} northern and central Apennine Mountains. Its range extends from the Province of Lucca and Province of Reggio Emilia southwards to the Province of Pescara. It is found in wooded valleys, on rocky outcrops and in caves and underground waters, often in limestone areas, at altitudes of up to 1600 m above sea level.|$|E
50|$|Ambrosi's cave {{salamander}} is {{endemic to}} a small area of southeastern France and northwestern Italy. Despite its name, it is not restricted to caves though it retreats under stones, logs and into caverns in dry periods. At other times it is active on the leaf litter near streams and on wet rocky outcrops in wooded valleys at altitudes of up to 1250 m. In the southeast of its distribution, where its range overlaps that of the <b>Italian</b> <b>cave</b> <b>salamander</b> (Speleomantes italicus), the two species sometimes hybridise.|$|E
50|$|Rare amphibians, {{found only}} on the island, are the Sardinian brook <b>salamander,</b> brown <b>cave</b> <b>salamander,</b> {{imperial}} <b>cave</b> <b>salamander,</b> Monte Albo <b>cave</b> <b>salamander,</b> Supramonte <b>cave</b> <b>salamander</b> and Sarrabus <b>cave</b> <b>salamander</b> (Speleomantes sarrabusensis); the Sardinian tree frog {{is also found in}} Corsica and in the Tuscan Archipelago. Among reptiles worthy of note are Bedriaga's rock lizard, the Tyrrhenian wall lizard and Fitzinger's algyroides, endemic species of Sardinia and Corsica. The island is inhabited by terrestrial tortoises and sea turtles like Hermann's tortoise, the spur-thighed tortoise, marginated tortoise (Testudo marginata sarda), Nabeul tortoise, loggerhead sea turtle and green sea turtle. A new arachnid species, endemic to the island, has been recently found: the Nuragic spider.|$|R

50|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} using nuclear and mitochondrial DNA {{seems to indicate}} that the Berry <b>Cave</b> <b>salamander</b> and the Tennessee <b>cave</b> <b>salamander</b> have diverged from the spring salamander only recently. The Berry <b>Cave</b> <b>salamander</b> is usually a paedomorphic species which does not undergo metamorphosis to an adult stage, instead remaining and breeding in the larval state, retaining its juvenile traits for the rest of its life.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Italian</b> <b>cave</b> <b>salamander</b> is {{a slender}} species with short limbs and grows to {{a length of}} about 12.5 cm {{including}} a short tail. The head is broad with prominent eyes {{and there is a}} distinct groove between the nostrils and the edge of the lips. The feet are partially webbed. It is dark in colour with mottled reddish or yellowish markings and a dark belly. In the north of its range it is more variable in colour and sometimes hybridises with Ambrosi's cave salamander (Speleomantes ambrosii).|$|E

40|$|Egg {{brooding}} {{females of}} the North-west <b>Italian</b> <b>Cave</b> <b>Salamander</b> Speleomantes strinatii display a complex array of parental behaviours. Recently, prolonged skin contacts {{between mother and}} young were documented by means of infra-red video recording, up to 40 days after hatching. In this study the behaviour of two females attending their young in presence of a po-tential predator was experimentally tested. About seven days after hatching, two adult males of S. strinatii were introduced inside the terrarium, where two females (A and B) were both attending eight young. In one case, female A approached female B and her young, but was repelled away. The approaching male always elicited an aggressive behaviour of females that repelled the intruder by head pushes and bites. This behaviour, {{similar to the one}} displayed during egg brooding, is the first evidence of active defence of young in terrestrial salamanders...|$|E

40|$|Post-hatching {{parental care}} {{is known in}} {{amphibians}} for frogs and caecilians but, so far, has never been reported for salamanders. Here, we describe the parental behavior of a female North-west <b>Italian</b> <b>Cave</b> <b>Salamander</b> “Speleomantes strinatii” from egg deposition to nest site abandonment. The female was kept in semi-natural conditions and filmed in complete darkness by an infrared video camera. In November 2007, the female laid nine eggs in a small depression of the terrarium floor, displaced the clutch with hind limbs, and showed antipredator behaviors towards a conspecific female and an intruding roof rat (Rattus rattus). During egg brooding, the female remained {{in contact with the}} clutch for about 98 % of the time. In September 2008, two young hatched and shared the nesting site for six weeks with the female, which attended the nesting site for 87 % of the time. Hatchlings repeatedly climbed over the female’s body, lying on her for hours. The female walked out of the nesting site with a young on its back twice. These prolonged skin contacts between parent and offspring should be considered as the first certain case of young attendance in salamanders. This behavior may be related to increased survival of hatchlings during their first weeks of life, when young are particularly vulnerable to predation, skin infection, and dehydration...|$|E
