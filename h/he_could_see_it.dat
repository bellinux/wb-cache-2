5|$|Upon his retirement, Butler {{bought a}} home in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, where {{he lived with his}} wife. In June 1940, he checked himself into the {{hospital}} after becoming sick a few weeks earlier. His doctor described his illness as an incurable condition of the upper gastro-intestinal tract that was probably cancer. His family remained by his side, even bringing his new car so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> from the window. He {{never had a chance to}} drive it. On June 21, 1940, Smedley Butler died in the Naval Hospital in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|When the {{air-cooled}} X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge went critical on 4 November 1943, Fermi {{was on hand}} just in {{case something}} went wrong. The technicians woke him early so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> happen. Getting X-10 operational was another milestone in the plutonium project. It provided data on reactor design, training for DuPont staff in reactor operation, and produced the first small quantities of reactor-bred plutonium. Fermi became an American citizen in July 1944, the earliest date the law allowed.|$|E
5|$|As the 20th century progressed, some councils in the United States became integrated, {{but many}} were not. Given {{the history of}} slavery and early {{development}} in the US, most African Americans were Protestant. But many in former French or Spanish territories had grown up Catholic. Church officials and organizations encouraged integration. By {{the end of the}} 1950s, Supreme Knight Luke E. Hart was actively encouraging councils to accept black candidates. In 1963, Hart attended a special meeting at the White House hosted by President John F. Kennedy to discuss civil rights with other religious leaders. A few months later, a local KofC council rejected a black man's application because of his race, notwithstanding that he was a graduate of Notre Dame University. Six council officers resigned in protest, and the incident made national news. Hart declared that the process for membership would be revised at the next Supreme Convention, but died before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> take place.|$|E
60|$|Was he asleep? Was it nightmare? No, it was night-tiger! He knew it, somehow; he felt it--but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'It isn't in my head--it's in my heart, my coeur de mère. We guess those things. You think <b>he's</b> selfish--I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> last night.' ...|$|R
60|$|There {{is a way}} out {{of every}} thing. And there was surely {{a way out of}} this, if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> only <b>see</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Jacques Doucet {{had seen}} the {{painting}} at the Salon d'Antin, yet remarkably seems to have purchased Les Demoiselles without asking Picasso to unroll it in his studio so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> again. André Breton later described the transaction: ...|$|E
2500|$|Napoleon was livid at Oudinot's poor showing and demoted {{him to the}} {{leadership}} of the XII Corps. The new army commander Marshal Ney was ordered to march east from Wittenberg to Baruth south of Berlin. Ney assumed command on 3 September and put his 58,000-man army in motion on the 5th. That day there was a sharp fight at Zahna in which Oudinot's corps drove Tauentzien's troops out of the town. As at Grossbeeren, the III Cavalry Corps was distributed among the different units of the army. Fournier accompanied XII Corps and Lorge marched with IV Corps. The Battle of Dennewitz began at 11:00 AM on 6 September when a IV Corps infantry division, supported by Lorge and a second infantry division, attacked Tauentzien north of Dennewitz. At first the French were successful but the arrival of Bülow's corps from the west forced back Lorge and the IV Corps. The VII Corps came on the field at 1:00 PM and became involved in a see-saw combat at the village of Golsdorf on the left flank. The XII Corps belatedly arrived on the left flank starting at 3:00 PM. Just as the French began gaining ground on the left, Ney ordered the XII Corps to the right to support the badly shaken IV Corps. Though <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> was a mistake, Oudinot obeyed the letter of his orders and marched off. Bülow, now supported by Swedish and Russian reinforcements, renewed his attack and broke through. The VII Corps might have been totally destroyed but for a [...] "timely charge" [...] by Defrance's cuirassiers. Even so, the battle was a disaster for the Imperial French forces whose flight also carried away the barely-engaged XII Corps. Ney lost 22,000 casualties, mostly prisoners, and 53 guns. Allied casualties at Zahna, Dennewitz, and the pursuit amounted to 10,500, almost all of them Prussian.|$|E
60|$|He went to {{the mantelpiece}} and took up the photograph. He carried it to the window where <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> better.|$|E
50|$|Lyon's first {{magazine}} cover story was with Lisa Marie Presley. They performed a fake marriage ceremony {{for the story}} so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> what <b>it</b> {{was like to be}} her husband for three days.|$|R
60|$|He {{brought out}} the nest, and held it so that <b>he</b> and Rollo <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
60|$|Annette {{was very}} pale and very pretty lying there. The baby was hidden away somewhere; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>it.</b> <b>He</b> {{went up to}} the bed, and with sudden emotion bent and kissed her forehead.|$|R
60|$|He {{said this}} so lucidly and {{consistently}} that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> further impose itself. If she hadn't been interested before she'd {{have been interested}} now.|$|E
60|$|As he spoke, {{the tree}} {{across the street}} {{appeared}} with dazzling brightness on his inner vision. It seemed to lurk just under his eyelids, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> whenever he wished.|$|E
60|$|Instinctively Larry {{moved his}} hand on the rifle and glanced towards the building. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> dimly, but no sound from it reached him, and Hetty, looking up, saw his face grow stern.|$|E
6000|$|... "Without imagination, I say, an armless man, born, blind, {{could not}} be made to believe, {{that he had a}} head of hair, since <b>he</b> <b>could</b> neither <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> nor feel it, nor has hair any feeling of itself." ...|$|R
60|$|The king groped about everywhere, like a blind man, {{and at last}} {{discovered}} the dead body of the wicked fairy lying on the sofa. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> of course, but he felt it with his hands.|$|R
60|$|The wedge, {{which had}} scattered, was reuniting. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> just <b>see</b> <b>it</b> dotted upon the sky, but he fancied that one dark object had come {{whirling}} down and struck the flats outshore of {{him a few}} seconds earlier.|$|R
6000|$|Joe nodded. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> all now. They had {{run into}} San Andreas, where his father worked the big quarries, and most {{probably}} the safe contained the wages of the thousand men or more whom he employed. [...] "Don't say anything," [...] he cautioned.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir. He {{said that}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> all now, and hinted at a guilty liaison between Master Simmons's {{mother and the}} head master, accusing the latter of having cooked the marks, as his {{expression}} was, {{in order to gain}} favour with the former." ...|$|E
6000|$|Once {{upon a time}} {{an artist}} who had painted a small and very {{beautiful}} picture placed it so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> in the mirror. He said, [...] "This doubles the distance and softens it, and it is twice as lovely as it was before." ...|$|E
6000|$|The sound {{steadily}} approached them. Nasmyth {{found something}} mysterious and rather eerie in it, {{and he was}} on the whole relieved when a dark figure materialized among the trees near by. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> barely <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> but Lisle called out sharply: ...|$|R
60|$|Then Caleb turned around, {{so as to}} {{have his}} face towards the light; and he found that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> then <b>see</b> <b>it</b> {{reflected}} very distinctly. His grandmother went on with her work, and Caleb sat for some time in silence.|$|R
6000|$|As Pupkin {{walked down}} the street, {{the whole thing was}} so vivid in his mind that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> picture it to the remotest detail. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> even <b>see</b> <b>it</b> all in type, in big {{headings}} in the newspapers of the following day: ...|$|R
60|$|As far as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> <b>it</b> was not serious. By a happy {{accident}} Wyatt's boots {{had gone}} home to right and left of precious plants but not on them. With {{a sigh of relief}} Mr. Appleby smoothed over the cavities, and rose to his feet.|$|E
6000|$|What if {{he could}} see this, his own skull, yellow and eroded? Two centuries old. Would he still speak? Would he speak, if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> the grinning, aged skull? What would there be for him to say, to tell the people? What message could he bring? ...|$|E
60|$|He {{was glad}} that Susan Nipper came between them, or he might have left her with a sorrowful remembrance of him. He was glad too {{that she did not}} look out of the coach again, but waved the little hand to him instead, as long as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|Flight Lieutenant Quinton {{picked up}} the only {{parachute}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> clipped <b>it</b> on to the cadet's harness, showed him how to pull the rip-cord and ordered him to jump. The cadet landed safely and was the only survivor of the disaster, all eight other occupants of the two planes perished.|$|R
60|$|But {{he needed}} to know what was right, what was the proper {{sequence}} of his acts. Staring at the darkness, he seemed to feel his course, though <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>it.</b> <b>He</b> bowed in obedience. The stars seemed to swing softly in token of submission.|$|R
6000|$|... "It isn't in my head--it's in my heart, my coeur de mere. We guess those things. You think <b>he's</b> selfish. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> last night." ...|$|R
60|$|Curiously-formed and large-leaved {{trees of}} the tropics, with their pendent parasites, as well as rank grasses, {{sprouting}} from below and hanging from above, partially concealed this cavern from Nigel when he first turned towards it, but a few steps further on <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> in all its rugged grandeur.|$|E
60|$|Yet why be afraid? It {{was bound}} to happen. To be murdered! He looked round in terror at the snow, the rocking, pale, shadowy slopes of the upper world. He {{was bound to}} be murdered, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it.</b> This was the moment when the death was uplifted, and there was no escape.|$|E
60|$|Here {{the forest}} floor {{appeared}} perfectly level. Patches of snow became frequent, and larger as Slone went on. At length the patches closed up, and soon extended as far as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see.</b> <b>It</b> was soft, affording difficult travel. Slone crossed hundreds of deer tracks, and the trail he was on eventually became a deer runway.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is nothing}} to fear," [...] said Aziel. But even as he spoke, {{although}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> a white face rose above {{the edge of the}} pit, like that of some ghost struggling from the tomb, watched them a moment with cold eyes, then disappeared again.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Look at {{the thing}} practically,' he thought. The faster {{he walked the}} firmer became his {{conviction}} that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> still <b>see</b> <b>it</b> through. <b>He</b> took out his watch--it was past seven--he began to hasten back. In the yard of the inn his driver was harnessing the horses; Swithin went up to him.|$|R
60|$|Not {{a muscle}} {{moved in the}} {{beautiful}} face before him. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> only <b>see</b> <b>it</b> in profile, for Marguerite seemed to be watching the stage intently, but Chauvelin was a keen observer; he noticed the sudden rigidity of the eyes, the hardening of the mouth, the sharp, almost paralysed tension of the beautiful, graceful figure.|$|R
