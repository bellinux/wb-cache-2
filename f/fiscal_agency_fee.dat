2500|$|The {{issue of}} <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> {{payments}} {{was a national}} and serious one. [...] By 1984, about 5 percent of employees at work sites covered by a union contract had opted not to join the union and instead pay an <b>agency</b> <b>fee.</b> In 1987, {{the same number of}} workers covered by CWA contracts were <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> payers. At the time of the Beck case in 1987, a majority of unions had set the <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> about equal to full union dues. More than 90 percent of all collective bargaining agreements (covering six million workers) made under the authority of the NLRA contained an <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> provision.|$|R
25|$|The 20 workers sought relief {{on three}} claims: 1) That the <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> {{was too high}} to cover only {{collective}} bargaining activities as authorized by NLRA Section 8(a)(3); 2) That the high <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> breached the CWA's duty of fair representation; and 3) That the high <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> violated the workers' First Amendment rights.|$|R
50|$|In 1985, the Court held in Pattern Makers v. NLRB, 473 U.S. 95, that a union member may resign at {{any time}} without notice. Pattern Makers further {{undermined}} the union shop by giving workers the right to resign from the union {{at any time}} and incur no penalty (such as termination). The Court also crafted additional rules regarding <b>agency</b> <b>fees</b> in Teachers v. Hudson, 475 U.S. 292 (1986). In Teachers, the union had failed to minimize the risk that <b>agency</b> <b>fees</b> might be used for impermissible purposes and had failed to provide <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> payers with adequate information about how the <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> was calculated. Now the Supreme Court imposed a third requirement, that <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> payers must be offered a timely, fair, and objective mechanism for challenging the computation of <b>agency</b> <b>fees.</b> The Court did uphold, however, the use of interest-bearing escrow accounts for holding disputed dues.|$|R
2500|$|Similarly, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) had had {{occasion}} since 1945 {{to address the}} union shop and <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> issues. Among its key cases was In re Union Starch & Refining Co., 87 NLRB 779, (1949). [...] The Board held in Union Starch that unions were permitted to charge nonmembers <b>agency</b> <b>fees</b> that were nearly equal to full union dues so long as these <b>agency</b> <b>fees</b> were uniform in nature and no additional requirements were made in violation of NLRA Section 8(a)(3)(B) or §8(b)(2). A second important case, Teamsters Local No. 959, 167 NLRB 1042 (1967), the Board concluded that special assessments or fees could {{not be part of}} the <b>agency</b> <b>fee.</b> Reacting to the Supreme Court's ruling in Retail Clerks v. Schermerhorn, the Board held in Detroit Mailers Union No. 40, 192 NLRB 951 (1971) that certain fraternal activities may be included in the <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> so long as they are not special assessments. The Board also ruled repeatedly {{on a number of issues}} associated with <b>agency</b> <b>fees.</b> It held in several cases that the NLRA does not permit the collection of assessments through the <b>agency</b> <b>fee.</b> The RLA, in contrast, does. The Board also held that when determining what an assessment is, facts (not labels) matter most.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the years}} {{just before the}} Supreme Court took up the Beck case, however, it {{elaborated}} on its previous <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> rulings. [...] In Ellis v. Railway Clerks, 466 U.S. 435 (1984), the Supreme Court concluded that the <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> may only cover those activities {{directly related to the}} union's role as a collective bargaining representative. [...] These included national conventions (where dues levels were set and union programs debated and established), social activities (which enhanced union solidarity, especially during negotiations), grievance handling, contract negotiation costs, and union communications, but excluded union organizing activities. The Court in Ellis also wrestled with the issue of rebates, and concluded that a union could not simply rebate <b>agency</b> <b>fees</b> to workers for that would essentially constitute a forced, interest-free loan from the worker to the union. In 1985, the Court held in Pattern Makers v. NLRB, 473 U.S. 95 (1985), that a union member may resign at any time without notice. Thus, Pattern Makers further undermined the union shop by giving workers the right to resign from the union at any time and incur no penalty (such as termination of employment). [...] The Court also crafted additional rules regarding <b>agency</b> <b>fees</b> in Teachers v. Hudson, 475 U.S. 292 (1986). In Teachers, the union had failed to minimize the risk that <b>agency</b> <b>fees</b> might be used for impermissible purposes and had failed to provide <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> payers with adequate information about how the <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> was calculated. Now the Supreme Court imposed a third requirement, that <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> payers must be offered a timely, fair, and objective mechanism for challenging the computation of <b>agency</b> <b>fees.</b> The Court did uphold, however, the use of interest-bearing escrow accounts for holding disputed dues.|$|R
50|$|The Supreme Court {{extended}} its constitutional and equity analysis to public employees in Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, 431 U.S. 209 (1977), holding that, where public employee collective bargaining exists and <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> clauses are clearly authorized by law, public employee <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> mechanisms also are constitutional. In Ellis v. Railway Clerks, 466 U.S. 435 (1984), the Supreme Court {{concluded that the}} <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> may only cover those activities {{directly related to the}} union's role as a collective bargaining representative.

50|$|An agency-shop {{agreement}} is concluded {{by a majority}} union and an employer or an employers’ organisation—concluded, that is, {{by way of a}} collective agreement.

Conscientious objectors to the policies of the union (on religious or moral grounds) must pay the fee; the fee, in turn, must be paid into a fund administered by the DoL. The fee that non-members pay must not be higher than the subscription fee payable by members of the majority union. <b>Agency</b> <b>fees</b> are paid over to a separate account and may be used only for the benefit of all employees at the workplace. <b>Agency</b> <b>fees</b> may not be used for political affiliation and may not be used for any purpose other than advancing or protecting the socioeconomic interests of employees.

25|$|The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari on May 31, 1987. In a {{surprising}} move, the U.S. Department of Justice supported CWA's appeal. The Solicitor General at the time, Charles Fried, {{argued that the}} voluntary nature of collective bargaining agreements (including <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> clauses) made the issue of coercion moot. Because states could and did ban <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> agreements, there was no governmental action {{on which to base}} a constitutional claim against the union. And because Section 8(a)3 plainly requires uniform dues and fees (e.g., unions could not charge <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> payers more nor less than regular members), the Justice Department felt Beck's claim was justified. Upset by the Justice Department's stand, Republican Senators Jesse Helms, Dan Quayle, Steve Symms, and Strom Thurmond filed an amicus curiae brief urging the Supreme Court to rule in Beck's favor.|$|R
5000|$|The {{high court}} also confronted {{the issue of}} remedy (how can non-members {{challenge}} the calculation of <b>agency</b> <b>fees)</b> in Machinists v. Street, and outlined several options which unions and employers might adopt (as well as rejecting remedies which the district court in the case had chosen). [...] Making its first private sector ruling in NLRB v. General Motors Corp., 373 U.S. 734 (1963), the Court held that <b>agency</b> <b>fees</b> equal to dues are not prohibited by the National Labor Relations Act. Nonetheless, in Retail Clerks v. Schermerhorn, 373 U.S. 746 (1963), the Court questioned whether an <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> set at a level equal to member dues was unfair because it set collective bargaining fees higher for non-members than for members. After reargument, however, the Court in Retail Clerks v. Schermerhorn, 375 U.S. 96 (1963), did not reach the issue again and instead decided the case on narrow procedural grounds (concluding that Florida's right-to-work law outlawed the union shop provision at issue). The Court further elaborated {{on the issue of}} remedies in Railway Clerks v. Allen, 373 U.S. 113 (1963), allowing <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> payers to opt out of all political expenditures rather than enunciate specific examples, but refusing to allow non-members to act as a class.|$|R

2500|$|Brennan next {{turned to}} the workers' first two claims. [...] The {{majority}} noted that NLRA Section 8(a)(3) contains two provisions which clearly permit <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> agreements. For the majority, [...] "The statutory question presented in this case, then, is whether this 'financial core' includes the obligation to support union activities beyond those germane to collective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance adjustment. We think it does not." [...] The majority reviewed the Court's previous decision in Machinists v. Street and found it controlling. The majority further concluded that Section 8(a)(3) and Section 2, Eleventh of the Railway Labor Act were statutorily equivalent. The majority reviewed at length the legislative history of both the Railway Labor Act and the National Labor Relations Act to provide support for this conclusion, and to show why in each case Congress had approved of <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> agreements. Relying on the Court's analysis of the Railway Labor Act in Street, the Supreme Court said CWA was not justified in concluding that Section 8(a)(3) permits the collection of <b>agency</b> <b>fees</b> {{in excess of the}} amount necessary to cover the costs of collective bargaining. The majority further found that the legislative history of the NLRA, the Taft-Hartley Act, and the Railway LAbor Act (RLA) showed that Congress intended to restrict <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> agreements to cover collective bargaining alone and no other purposes.|$|R
