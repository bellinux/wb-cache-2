40|$|Koristeći bogatu arhivsku građu matičnih knjiga grada Pule, autor je u ovome članku analizirao relativno malobrojne slučajeve koji se odnose na spominjanje pripadnika nekih posebnih skupina, poput Cigana, ali i pojedinaca s različitim tjelesnim i psihičkim nedostatcima, kao što su slijepe, kljaste, šepave, nijeme i mentalno zaostale osobe. Using the {{plentiful}} archival fond of {{the civil}} and ecclesiastical <b>records</b> of <b>the</b> city of Pula, in this article author analyses <b>recorded</b> cases of <b>the</b> relatively not numerous groups of people, such as Gipsies, mentally retarded, blind, physically disabled and mute persons. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>records</b> of Pula Gipsies are mentioned under the term Cigalo, Cingano, Cingaro and Zingaro. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>records</b> of <b>the</b> marriages {{one of them is}} mentioned two times at the beginning of <b>the</b> eighteenth century. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>records</b> of <b>the</b> baptisms Gipsies are mentioned 10 times: two times <b>in</b> <b>the</b> seventeenth century and eight times <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eighteenth century. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>records</b> of <b>the</b> deceased they are mentioned 13 times: fi ve times <b>in</b> <b>the</b> seventeenth century and eight times <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eighteenth century. Mentally disabled persons are rarely <b>recorded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sources, too – only 11 times. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>records</b> of <b>the</b> marriages they are not mentioned at all, but <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>records</b> of <b>the</b> decea-sed the most of them are mentioned. Blind persons are mentioned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>records</b> of <b>the</b> deceased only two times (both <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eighteenth century), and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>records</b> of <b>the</b> holy confi rmation only one blind person is documented (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> nineteenth century). Similarly, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>records</b> of <b>the</b> holy confi rmation only one blind person is <b>recorded.</b> By <b>the</b> same token, only one physically disabled person is <b>recorded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>records</b> of <b>the</b> deceased (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> mid eighteenth century), and only one limping person is mentioned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>records</b> of <b>the</b> holy confi rmation (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> nineteenth century). Likewise, one mentally retarded boy is <b>recorded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>records</b> of <b>the</b> deceased <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mid eighteenth century. Mute persons are mentioned 4 times: once <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second half of the eighteenth century and three times <b>in</b> <b>the</b> beginning of the nineteenth century. To sum all, Gipsies and variously disabled persons are recorded 36 times: 21 recordings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>records</b> of <b>the</b> deceased, 11 notes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>records</b> of baptisms, and two times <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>records</b> of <b>the</b> holy confi rmation and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>records</b> of <b>the</b> marriages.

5|$|In {{the band}}'s fourth album, 2011's The Here and Now, the band {{set out to}} mix their typical sounds with the music they were {{listening}} to at the time. The response was polarising.

5|$|Less clearcut is the {{question}} of whether the regular auxilia recruited barbari (barbarians, as the Romans called people living outside the empire's borders).
