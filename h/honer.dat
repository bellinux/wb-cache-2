Shure yer <b>honer</b> knows the masther, Mr. Thady down at Ballycloran; he will tell yer <b>honer</b> I'd nothing in life to do in it. Then don't you know yourself I live with Joe Reynolds down at Drumleesh, and war only up here jist gagging with the ould woman and the boys, and knew nothing in life--how could I?--about the malt, Captain Ussher." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ballydahan, shure, yer <b>honer.</b> That {{last war}} Connick-a-coppul, and that other, the big un intirely, where the crass road takes away to Buttevant, that was Glounthauneroughtymore. Faix and that's been the murthering hill for cattle since first I knew it. Bedad yer <b>honer</b> 'll make it smooth as a bowling-green." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And the childer is worse, yer honer," [...] said a fourth. [...] "The male is bad {{for them}} intirely. Saving yer <b>honer's</b> presence, their bellies is gone away most to nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shall I take yer <b>honer's</b> horse round then?" [...] said he; and Ussher {{dismounted}} {{without saying}} anything further, and ran up the stone steps, {{at the top of}} which Feemy opened the hall door for him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is that yer <b>honer,</b> at last? Glory be to God! but I {{thought you}} wor niver coming. The misthress 'll be perished with the could." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now, Miss Feemy, if you'd {{only get}} up and begin, dear, the others would soon folly; come, Captain Ussher--would yer <b>honer</b> jist stand up with Miss Feemy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well then, yer <b>honer,</b> I'll jist go and spake to Father Cullen. Though {{he is not}} so good-humoured like,--at least, he don't {{be always}} {{laughing}} at a boy." ...|$|E
5000|$|The museum, {{which opened}} in July 1999 commemorates the Denshawai Incident, Egyptian peasants who killed a number of British {{occupation}} army officers in 1906, in retribution of the public hanging of Egyptian local villagers. [...] The museum <b>honers</b> the seven Egyptians who were hanged by the British on 26 June 1906.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sorrow {{to it for}} male," [...] said Mooney. [...] "It's {{the worst}} vittles iver a man tooked into the inside of him. Saving yer <b>honer's</b> {{presence}} it's as much as I can do to raise the bare arm of me since the day I first began with the yally male." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, you're joking, Masther Barry. You wouldn't {{like to be}} afther doing that. So yer <b>honer's</b> {{been down}} to the widdy's? That's well; it's a fine thing to see you on good terms, since you're soon like to be so sib. Well, there an't no betther fellow, from this to Galway, than Martin Kelly, that's one comfort, Masther Barry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Faix, yer <b>honer,</b> thin, Mr. Herbert," [...] {{said one}} man, {{standing}} {{at the bottom of}} the hill, with the half-filled wheelbarrow still hanging in his hands--an Englishman would have put down the barrow while he was speaking, making some inner calculation about the waste of his muscles; but an Irishman would despise himself for such low economy--"Faix, thin, yer <b>honer,</b> Mr. Herbert; an' it's yourself is a sight good for sore eyes. May the heavens be your bed, for it's you is the frind to a poor man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yer <b>honer</b> couldn't wear a morsel {{of leather}} {{belonging}} to ere a one of 'em, young or ould. There niver was a foot like that yet among the O'Conors." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well then, I don't rightly know, Mr Barry; it wasn't {{only about}} ten when I tuk {{in the last}} hot wather, and I didn't see yer <b>honer</b> afther that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your <b>honers</b> are welcome, Miss; your <b>honers</b> are welcome, Captain Ussher," [...] said Denis, forgetting that, for the present, he {{was only}} a guest himself; and then Brady, and then Shamuth na Pibu'a, the blind piper from County Mayo, [...] "who had made the music out of his own head, all about O'Connell"--and then Biddy, and Mrs. Mehan, and all the boys and girls one after another, got up, and ducked their heads down in token of kindly welcome to the [...] "young misthress and her lover;" [...] and though most of those present, at other times, would have said that it was a pity their own Miss Feemy should be marrying [...] "a born inimey of the counthry, like a Revenue officer, and a black Prothestant too," [...] it wasn't now, when she had come to honour the wedding of one of themselves, that they would be remembering {{anything}} against her or her lover.|$|R
5000|$|... 2003-04 saw Williams {{feature in}} a trilogy of films written and {{directed}} by the iconic Peter Greenaway, called The Tulse Luper Suitcases. The first of which [...] "The Moab Story" [...] was an official selection for the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival.

5000|$|In 2007, I Monster started {{collaborating with}} Finnish pop artist, HK119, for her second album. The {{resulting}} project, Fast, Cheap and Out of Control {{was released in}} September 2008 on One Little Indian Records, and saw I Monster co-write and co-produce over {{three quarters of the}} album. This collaboration came from Dean <b>Honers</b> previous role as a remixer for HK119's debut single, [...] "Pick Me Up", from her debut eponymous album in 2006.|$|R
6000|$|... "And it's his <b>honer</b> that's {{welcome to}} 'em," [...] said Larry, {{grinning}} {{from ear to}} ear now that he saw that [...] "the masther" [...] was once more in a good humour.|$|E
6000|$|... "You war not! faix but you war in {{the wrong}} then, Captain, for they had fine sport, right away behind Lord Lorton's new farms--right to Boyle. I wonder yer <b>honer</b> warn't in it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How should I know?" [...] {{retorted}} Bob; [...] "you don't {{suppose that}} the d'rectors is all my partikler friends, do you? There's {{only two or three}} of 'em as has the <b>honer</b> of my acquaintance." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "We your Petitioners, {{therefore}} Humbly {{pray that}} your <b>Honers</b> {{out of your}} great goodness would {{put a stop to}} such a glaring breach of Humanity and gratitude, and grant us such privileges of hunting in this state, as in your wisdom you shall think fitt, and we your petitioners as in duty bound shall every pray." [...] While Governor Moultrie was sympathetic, the petition was referred to a committee and the Catawba hunting rights were affirmed by a resolution of the House, the situation probably neverchanged much.|$|R
40|$|Growth {{characteristics}} of selected Picea rubens Sarg. (red spruce) and Abies balsamea (L.) Mill. (balsam fir) crop trees were studied in a northern conifer forest {{to determine the}} effects of precommercial thinning (PCT) 25 years after initial treatment. Two measures of growth efficiency (GE, growth per unit of growing space) were examined: stemwood increment (dm 3) per unit of projected leaf area (PLA) (m 2) and stemwood increment (dm 3) per unit of crown projection area (CPA) (m 2). Stem form differences were evaluated by comparing stem taper between species and treatments. Branch diameters were measured between 1. O- 2. 0 meters above breast height (BH, 1. 37 m (4. 5 ft)) for each crop tree, and the number and size of branches and the ratio of knots were determined. Volumes of all crop trees were calculated using Smalian's formula (Avery and Burkhart 1994) applied to different geometric forms of the tree to estimate total cubic foot volume from diameter measurements up the tree bole. The efficacy of <b>Honer's</b> (1967) volume equation for estimating total cubic foot volume from diameter at BH (DBH) and total height (THT) was tested by comparing measured values to the estimated values. Differences in tree stability were determined by comparing height to diameter ratios (IUD) of all the crop trees by species and treatment...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shure, yer <b>honer,</b> Mr Lambert, I can't thin, for I'm afther {{engaging}} myself this blessed {{minute to}} Mr Larry Dillon, only he's jist trotted round to the stables to spake {{a word to}} Mick Keogh." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Och thin, Mr. Green, yer <b>honer,</b> I wouldn't be afther telling agin yer honer; indeed I wouldn't thin, av' the masther {{would only}} let me hould my tongue." [...] And he looked across at me, deprecating my anger.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yer <b>honer.</b> It's {{all along}} of his honer's thick shoes;" [...] and Larry, {{stepping}} backwards towards the door, lifted them up from some corner, and coming well forward, exposed {{them with the}} soles uppermost to the whole table.|$|E
6000|$|... "Begorra, I don't know," [...] {{said the}} girl, [...] "only he's {{in bed and}} fast. Couldn't yer <b>honer</b> call agin {{about four or five}} o'clock? That's the time the masther's most fittest to be talking to the likes of yer honer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, yer <b>honer,</b> in course not; {{only you}} being so {{thick with the}} masther, and that like; and av he'd spake a good word for me--as why shouldn't he?--and I knowing nothing at all at all about it, perhaps yer honer--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Actuated {{by these}} apprehensions, Denis, {{on the morning}} of the wedding, had gone to Ussher to unfold his budget of dreadful news,--to assure the Captain that his only object [...] "was to get himself married," [...] and to see that the [...] "pigs and the thrifle of change were all right,"--and {{strongly}} to advise the Captain to stay away; [...] "not that it wouldn't be a great <b>honer</b> for a poor boy like him to see his <b>honer</b> down there, for he had the greatest rispect in life for him, and all that wore the King's sword; but there war no knowing what them boys might be afther when they got the dhrink in them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sorrow a know, yer honer; ye see Barney {{brought them}} down {{here from the}} {{mountains}} when we warn't in it; and it war {{some of the boys}} up there was getting him to get away the malt unknownst, hearing of yer <b>honer,</b> maybe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Into the house, yer <b>honer!</b> not {{a foot of}} it! why, you'd have Miss Feemy in fits; and the owld man'd {{be worse}} still, wid all thim fellows coming from Carrick and sitting on the body, discoursing whether it wor to be murdher or not." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's me, yer <b>honer.</b> Here ye are," [...] {{replied the}} Irishman, {{bounding}} {{away with a}} yell, and shouldering a huge leathern trunk, with which he vanished from the scene, leaving Ned to pursue the train of thought evoked by his account of his remarkable experiences.|$|E
6000|$|... "And it's his <b>honer</b> that's {{welcome to}} 'em," [...] said he again, {{as he pulled}} off the table-cloth with a flourish. [...] "And why wouldn't he, and he able to folly the hounds betther nor any Englishman that iver war in these parts before,--anyways so Mick says!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Faix, yer <b>honer,</b> he's very bitther intirely, when he's waked this early. But in course I'll {{be led by}} yer honers. I'll say then, {{that the}} lord, and Parson Armstrong, and the docther, and Mr Martin, is waiting to spake two words to him. Is that it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Misther Thady, yer <b>honer,</b> Father John says as how he'll be glad av yer honer'll {{come down}} to dinner with him at six; and he says as how you must come, Mr. Thady, because divil a bit he'll ate himself, he says, till you're in it." ...|$|E
