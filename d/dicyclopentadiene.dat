2500|$|Prelog's {{method was}} refined in 1956. The {{decarboxylation}} yield was increased {{by the addition}} of the Heinsdecker pathway (11%) and the Hoffman reaction (24%) that raised the total yield to 6.5%. The process was still too complex, and a more convenient method was found in 1957 by Paul von Ragué Schleyer: <b>dicyclopentadiene</b> was first hydrogenated {{in the presence of a}} catalyst (e.g. platinum dioxide) and then transformed into adamantane using a Lewis acid (e.g. aluminium chloride) as another catalyst. This method increased the yield to 30–40% and provided an affordable source of adamantane; it therefore stimulated characterization of adamantane and is still used in laboratory practice. The adamantane synthesis yield was later increased to 60% and 98% [...] Today, adamantane is an affordable chemical compound with a cost of about $1 a gram.|$|E
2500|$|Their {{approach}} {{was to develop}} a polymeric matrix which involved both a reactive liquid healing agent and a catalyst. [...] While undamaged, these were kept structurally separate. The liquid agent was contained inside non-reactive reservoirs within the material, while the catalyst was dispersed throughout the polymer. [...] Once the material was damaged and a crack occurred, the reservoirs broke open, and capillary action caused the liquid agent to disperse into the damaged area, where it reacted with the catalyst and solidified to seal the crack. [...] They have studied both the use of a contained healing agent and a dispersed catalyst, and the use of a dispersed healing agent and a contained catalyst. [...] Using [...] <b>dicyclopentadiene</b> (DCPD) and Grubbs' catalyst in an epoxy matrix, [...] polycyclopendiene was formed to seal cracks, recovering up to 75% of the original fracture toughness.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{invention}} of coal gas early in the 19th century, {{it was discovered that}} numerous organic and inorganic chemicals could be obtained when purifying the gas. Processes began to be developed to recover these, and a major branch of the British chemical industry – the coal tar and ammonia by-products industry – came into existence. By 1876 a nearby company, Burt, Boulton and Haywood of Silvertown, was distilling each year [...] of coal tar to manufacture ingredients for disinfectants, insecticides and dyes. Sulphur from the gas works was the raw material for local manufacturers of sulphuric acid needed by other nearby companies producing products such as fertilizers. Subsequently the GLCC decided that it would carry out the processing of by-products itself, rather than sell them to independent chemical companies. A purpose-built chemical works, Beckton Products Works, was constructed in 1879. It was the largest tar and ammonia by-products works in the UK, possibly in the world. Besides millions of gallons of road tar, products included phenol, the cresols and xylenols, naphthalene, pyridine bases, creosote, benzene, toluene, xylene, solvent naphtha, ammonium sulphate and ammonia solution, sulphuric acid, picolines, quinoline, quinaldine, acenaphthene, anthracene and <b>dicyclopentadiene.</b> Since the Products works was dependent on by-products of gas manufacture it could not long survive the introduction of natural gas. The last train carrying chemical products, a load of pitch, left the works on 1 June 1970.|$|E

50|$|Dilithium pentalenide was {{isolated}} in 1962, long before pentalene itself in 1997. It is prepared from reaction of dihydropentalene (pyrolysis of an isomer of <b>dicyclopentadiene)</b> with n-butyllithium in solution and forms a stable salt. In accordance with its structure proton NMR shows 2 signals in a 2 to 1 ratio. The addition of two electrons removes the antiaromaticity; {{it becomes a}} planar 10π-electron aromatic species and is thus a bicyclic analogue of the cyclooctatetraene (COT) dianion C8H82−.|$|E

50|$|For {{materials}} such as components in microelectronics, polymeric coatings, and adhesives, nanocapsules can reduce damage caused by high loads. The healing of cracks within these materials is alleviated by dispersing nanocapsules within the polymer. The healing substances include <b>dicyclopentadiene</b> (DCPD), which is prepared on site within the material by sonication. The nanoencapsulated material is first emulsified within the host material by creating an oil-in-water self-healing epoxy. The emulsified material is then agitated within the host material to form particles which then bond to the host material.|$|E
5000|$|Endo-exo {{isomerism}} is {{a special}} type of stereoisomerism found in organic compounds with a substituent on a bridged ring system.

The prefix exo is reserved for the isomer with the substituent located farthest, or [...] "anti", to the longest bridge.

50|$|EPDM rubber (ethylene {{propylene}} diene monomer (M-class) rubber), a type {{of synthetic}} rubber, is an elastomer characterized by {{a wide range of}} applications. The M refers to its classification in ASTM standard D-1418; the M class includes rubbers having a saturated chain of the polymethylene type. Dienes currently used in the manufacture of EPDM rubbers are <b>dicyclopentadiene</b> (DCPD), ethylidene norbornene (ENB), and vinyl norbornene (VNB). EPDM rubber is closely related to ethylene propylene rubber: ethylene propylene rubber is a copolymer of ethylene and propylene, whereas EPDM rubber is a terpolymer of ethylene, propylene, and a diene-component.|$|E
50|$|This {{process has}} been {{demonstrated}} with <b>dicyclopentadiene</b> (DCPD) and Grubbs' catalyst (benzylidene-bis(tricyclohexylphosphine)dichlororuthenium). Both DCPD and Grubbs' catalyst are imbedded in an epoxy resin. The monomer on its own is relatively unreactive and polymerization does not take place. When a microcrack reaches both the capsule containing DCPD and the catalyst, the monomer is released from the core-shell microcapsule and comes in contact with exposed catalyst, upon which the monomer undergoes ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP). The metathesis reaction of the monomer involves the severance of the two double bonds in favor of new bonds. The presence of the catalyst allows for the energy barrier (energy of activation) to be lowered, and the polymerization reaction can proceed at room temperature. The resulting polymer allows the epoxy composite material to regain 67% of its former strength.|$|E
