5|$|<b>Health</b> <b>indicators</b> in Ratanakiri are {{the worst}} in Cambodia. Life {{expectancy}} is 39 years for men and 43 years for women. Malaria, tuberculosis, intestinal parasites, cholera, diarrhea, and vaccine-preventable diseases are endemic. Ratanakiri has very high rates of maternal and child mortality; in Ratanakiri and neighboring Mondulkiri (whose figures were combined {{in the most recent}} survey), over 10% of children die before the age of five. Ratanakiri also has the country's highest rates of severe malnutrition. Ratanakiri residents' poor health can be attributed to a variety of factors, including poverty, remoteness of villages, poor quality medical services, and language and cultural barriers that prevent Khmer Loeu from obtaining medical care. The province has one referral hospital, 10 health centers, and 17 health posts. Medical equipment and supplies are minimal, and most health facilities are staffed by nurses or midwives, who are often poorly trained and irregularly paid.|$|E

Without official statistics as to their number, age structure or distribution, it was not possible for government agencies to establish soundly based policies for serving Aboriginal people, especially in the area of health. The availability of demographic data following the 1971 census (and onwards) relating to the Aboriginal population enabled the determination and monitoring of key <b>health</b> <b>indicators</b> such as infant mortality rates and life expectancy.

Little is known about its importance as a tool for monitoring the right to health. A non-exhaustive review of scientific articles reported in Medline was done in order to better understand how patient satisfaction can be investigated and what it indicates. Over time and years the concept of patient satisfaction shows an evolution towards complexity, while becoming more operational. Indeed patient satisfaction studies have proved of value as a <b>health</b> <b>indicator</b> and allowed the implementation of improvement strategies in the health sector based on “the voice of the patient”, thus becoming a potential right to <b>health</b> <b>indicator.</b> However they do have limits, but we consider nevertheless that they are of interest as a <b>health</b> <b>indicator</b> and that they should be put as such on the public health agenda...|$|R

25|$|The Preston {{curve is}} a {{relationship}} found in cross-country data - that is, it holds for a sample of countries taken at a particular point in time. Some research however suggests that a similar relationship does not hold in time series and longitudinal data within individual countries. In particular, per capita incomes between countries have generally diverged over time, while life expectancies, and other <b>health</b> <b>indicators</b> such as the infant mortality rates, have converged (this trend was interrupted in the 1990s with {{the outbreak of the}} AIDS epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa). This suggests that over time changes in income may have no impact on health or even be negatively related.|$|E
25|$|The {{environmental}} Kuznets {{curve is}} a hypothesized relationship between environmental quality and economic development: various indicators {{of environmental degradation}} tend to get worse as modern economic growth occurs until average income reaches a certain point {{over the course of}} development.

40|$|Self-organizing maps {{have been}} used {{extensively}} for condition-based maintenance, where quantization errors of test data referring to the self-organizing maps of healthy training data {{have been used}} as features. Researchers have used minimum quantization error as a <b>health</b> <b>indicator,</b> which is sensitive to noise in the training data. Some other researchers have used the average of the quantization errors as a <b>health</b> <b>indicator,</b> where the best matching units of the trained self-organizing maps are required to be convex. These requirements are not always satisfied. This paper introduces a method that improves self-organizing maps for anomaly detection by addressing these issues. Noise dominated best matching units extracted from the map trained by the healthy training data are removed, and the rest are used as healthy references. For a given test data observation, the k-nearest neighbor algorithm is applied to identify neighbors of the observation that occur in the references. Then the Euclidean distance between the test data observation and the centroid of the neighbors is calculated as a <b>health</b> <b>indicator.</b> Compared with the minimum quantization error, the <b>health</b> <b>indicator</b> extracted by this method is less sensitive to noise, and compared with the average of quantization errors, it does not put limitations on the convexity or distribution of the best matching units.

500|$|Over {{the decade}} from 2001 to 2011, Gujarat {{did not change}} its {{position}} relative {{to the rest of}} the country with respect to poverty and female literacy, remaining near the median of the 29 Indian states. It showed only a marginal improvement in rates of infant mortality, and its position with respect to individual consumption declined. With respect to the quality of education in government schools, the state ranked below most Indian states. The social policies of the government generally did not benefit Muslims, Dalits, and Adivasis, and generally increased social inequalities. Development in Gujarat was generally limited to the urban middle class, and citizens in rural areas or from lower castes were increasingly marginalised. In 2013 the state ranked 10th of 21 Indian states in the Human Development Index. Political Scientist Christophe Jaffrelot says that under Modi the number of families below the poverty line has increased and conditions for rural adivasi and dalits, in particular, have declined. Under Modi, the state government spent far less than the national average on education and healthcare. In July 2013, economics Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen expressed disapproval of Modi's governance record, saying that under his administration Gujarat's [...] "record in education and healthcare is pretty bad". However, economists Arvind Panagariya and Jagdish Bhagwati say that Gujarat's social indicators have improved from a lower baseline than that of other Indian states.

40|$|Strawberries are an {{economically}} important crop in the United States {{worth more than}} $ 2 billion annually. Many studies have correlated strawberry growth and yield with {{various aspects of the}} soil. Mostly these studies involve the effects of individual soil nutrients, {{and to a lesser extent}} soil physical properties. Studies examining the impact of the biological components of soils mostly focus on pathogens and not beneficial organisms. Agronomists recently introduced the concept of "soil health" in which chemical, physical, and biological components of the soil are considered simultaneously. Selected indicators are used to predict the performance of a crop and identify which components should be modified to positively impact crop growth and yield. A healthy soil is highly functional in both the short term and long term and is able to support human needs and ecosystem sustainability. This study tests the hypothesis that in a perennial strawberry field the C:N ratio of soil amendments and tilling deep or shallow would affect soil biological <b>health</b> <b>indicator</b> tests and that these would be correlated with yield. Soil biological <b>health</b> <b>indicator</b> tests were not correlated with yield although treatments did affect both indicator tests and yield. The strawberries grown in straw-amended soil had the lowest plant growth and yield but not lower biological soil <b>health</b> <b>indicator</b> test results. Sawdust-amended soil had higher soil biological <b>health</b> <b>indicator</b> test results from increased microbial activity, but had the same yield as unamended soil. Alternative soil biological <b>health</b> <b>indicator</b> tests that are correlated with strawberry yield might be more appropriate for perennial crops. We hypothesized that decreased strawberry growth in straw-amended soil was due to either a chemical leachate, an antagonistic microbial community, or a physical barrier to root growth. These hypotheses were tested in the greenhouse. The reduced strawberry growth in the field was not replicated in the greenhouse as no treatment had an effect on plant growth. The reason for reduced plant growth in straw- amended plots in the field is still unclear, but there are benefits to using straw such as insulating berries over the winter, suppressing weeds, preventing soil from getting on the fruit, and reducing plant diseases. Growers should continue to use straw until an appropriate alternative solution is found. ii...|$|R
40|$|Background:Current health {{measurement}} instruments tend tomeasure aspectsof ill-health rather thanhealth ingeneral. There is a {{need for}} a salutogenic perspective when describing health and developing a health measurement instrument. The aim of this article is topresent the developmentprocess and quality assessment of a salutogenic <b>health</b> <b>indicator</b> scale. Methods:A description of health, emanating from the concept of health, positive health and well-being, was used as a basis for the construction of the scale. The scale is a semantic differential consisting of 12 indicator items covering nine heath-related dimensions. A principal component analysis was performed, and three <b>health</b> <b>indicator</b> indexes were constructed. Correlation with self-rated health questions was investigated, weighted kappa values were calculated, and Cronbach’s alpha (CA) was used to check internal consistency. Results: The analysis resulted in a two-factor model, and the indexes were named intrapersonal characteristics (CA 0. 90) and interactive function (CA 0. 84), summarised into health complete (CA 0. 92). Kappa values ranged from 0. 44 to 0. 67, and correlations with self-rated health status were stronger than those with self-rated sick-leave. Conclusions: Our health description was characterized by complexity, but the instrument is a short salutogenic <b>health</b> <b>indicator</b> scale. The shortness increases the usability. The instrument seems to be able to offset the current problemof there being a lack of salutogenic health measurement instruments. The results indicate that further testing is justified...|$|R
