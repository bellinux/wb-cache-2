In addition to annual reporting, <b>EOWA</b> leads Australian employers to create workplaces where women’s contribution is equally valued, recognised and rewarded through a variety of programs. These include educational services, the <b>EOWA</b> Business Achievement Awards, Employer of Choice for Women citation and numerous publications, including the <b>EOWA</b> Census of Women in Leadership, which engage community debate and increase the rate of change.

50|$|Æthelbald came of the Mercian royal line, {{although}} his father, Alweo, was never king. Alweo's father was <b>Eowa,</b> {{who may have}} shared the throne for some time with his brother, Penda of Mercia. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle does not mention Eowa; though it does date Penda's reign as the thirty years from 626 to 656, when Penda was killed {{at the battle of}} the Winwaed. However, two later sources name <b>Eowa</b> as king as well: the Historia Brittonum and the Annales Cambriae. The Annales Cambriae is the source for <b>Eowa's</b> death in 644 at the battle of Maserfield, where Penda defeated Oswald of Northumbria. Details on Penda's reign are scarce, and it is a matter for speculation whether <b>Eowa</b> was an underking, owing allegiance to Penda, or if instead <b>Eowa</b> and Penda had divided Mercia between them. If they did divide the kingdom, it is likely that <b>Eowa</b> ruled northern Mercia, as Penda's son Peada was established later as the king of southern Mercia by the Northumbrian Oswiu, who defeated the Mercians and killed Penda in 656. It is possible that <b>Eowa</b> fought against Penda at Maserfield.|$|R
50|$|The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle {{records the}} lineage of two Mercian king's of <b>Eowa's</b> blood, Æthelbald and Offa.|$|R
5|$|Another {{possibility}} {{was suggested}} by Brooks: Penda might have lost power {{at some point}} after Heavenfield, and <b>Eowa</b> may have actually been ruling the Mercians {{for at least some}} of the period as a subject ally or puppet of Oswald. Brooks cited Bede's statement implying that Penda's fortunes were mixed during his 22 years in power and noted the possibility that Penda's fortunes were low at this time. Thus it may be that Penda was not consistently the dominant figure in Mercia during the years between Hatfield and Maserfield. argues against the idea that Penda and <b>Eowa</b> were co-rulers, and favours the idea that <b>Eowa</b> was ruling Mercia from c. 635 until 642.|$|R
50|$|Besides Penda and <b>Eowa</b> (who {{the author}} of the Historia Brittonum said were the sons of Pybba who were the best known to him), Pybba also {{apparently}} had a son named Coenwalh. Every king from Penda until Ceolwulf, who was deposed in 823, was said to be a descendant of Pybba, either through Penda, <b>Eowa,</b> or Coenwalh (perhaps excluding Beornrad, who ruled briefly and whose background is unknown).|$|R
5|$|The Historia Brittonum {{says that}} Pybba had 12 sons, {{including}} Penda, but that Penda and <b>Eowa</b> of Mercia were those best known to its author. (Many of these 12 sons of Pybba {{may in fact}} merely represent later attempts to claim descent from him.) Besides <b>Eowa,</b> the pedigrees also give Penda a brother named Coenwalh from whom two later kings were said to descend, although this may instead represent his brother-in-law Cenwalh of Wessex.|$|R
50|$|However, if no {{descendants}} of Cenwalh held the throne in Wessex, {{it may be}} that his descendants held power in Mercia and Kent in the 9th century. The Mercian kings Coenwulf and Ceolwulf, and their brother Cuthred, King of Kent, claimed descent from an otherwise unknown brother of Penda and <b>Eowa</b> called Coenwalh. It has been suggested that Coenwalh was in fact this Cenwalh, brother-in-law, rather than brother, of Penda and <b>Eowa.</b>|$|R

50|$|According to the Historia Brittonum and the Annales Cambriae, Penda's brother <b>Eowa,</b> {{also said}} to have been a king of the Mercians, was killed in the battle along with Oswald. The {{possibility}} exists that he was subject to Oswald and fighting in the battle as his ally. It has been suggested that <b>Eowa</b> was the dominant king among the Mercians for a period prior to the battle, and it has also been suggested that he had ruled the northern Mercians while Penda ruled the southern Mercians. Since the Historia Brittonum says Penda ruled for only ten years (Bede says 22 years: 633-655), this may mean that it was dating Penda's reign from the time of his victory at Maserfield; this would make sense if <b>Eowa's</b> death removed an important rival to Penda, enabling him to claim or consolidate authority over all the Mercians.|$|R
50|$|It was in {{the battle}} of Maserfield that Oswald of Northumbria was {{defeated}} and killed by the Mercians under Penda. <b>Eowa</b> also died in that battle, although little is known about this. It has been suggested that <b>Eowa</b> may have been a co-ruler of the Mercians alongside Penda, or possibly even superior in status to Penda at this time (if so, this could explain why the Historia Brittonum seems to date Penda's reign from the battle of Maserfield), and that he may have been subject to Oswald and fighting as his ally in the battle."The Formation of the Mercian Kingdom", in S. Bassett's The Origins of Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms. It is possible that it was customary among the Mercians until this time for there to be more than one king, and Penda and <b>Eowa</b> may have ruled over the southern and northern Mercians respectively.|$|R

"Aethelbald was Alweo's offspring, Alweo Eawa's offspring, Eawa Pybba's offspring...", Later, {{it gives}} the lineage of <b>Eowa's</b> great-great-grandson Offa, who ruled from 757 to 796 and was descended from Osmod rather than <b>Eowa's</b> other son Alweo, [...] "That Offa was Thingfrith's offspring, Thingfrith Eanwulf's offspring, Eanwulf Osmod's offspring, Osmod Eawa's offspring, Eawa Pybba's offspring, Pybba Creoda's offspring, Creoda Cynewald's offspring, Cynewald Cnebba's offspring, Cnebba Icel's offspring, Icel Eomer's offspring, Eomer Angeltheow's offspring, Angeltheow Offa's offspring, Offa Wermund's offspring, Wermund Wihtlaeg's offspring, Wihtlaeg Woden's offspring".|$|R
5|$|Penda's brother <b>Eowa</b> {{was also}} said by the Historia Brittonum and the Annales Cambriae {{to have been}} a king of the Mercians at the time of Maserfield. The {{question}} of what sort of relationship of power existed between the brothers before the battle is a matter of speculation. <b>Eowa</b> may have simply been a sub-king under Penda and {{it is also possible that}} Penda and <b>Eowa</b> ruled jointly during the 630s and early 640s: joint kingships were not uncommon among Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of the period. They may have ruled the southern and northern Mercians respectively. That Penda ruled the southern part is a possibility suggested by his early involvement in the area of the Hwicce, to the south of Mercia, as well as by the fact that, after Penda's death, his son Peada was allowed to rule southern Mercia while the northern part was placed under direct Northumbrian control.|$|R
5|$|<b>Eowa</b> {{was killed}} at Maserfield along with Oswald, {{although}} on which side he fought is unknown. It {{may well be}} that he fought as a dependent ally of Oswald against Penda. If <b>Eowa</b> was in fact dominant among the Mercians during the period leading up to the battle, then his death could have marked what the author of the Historia Brittonum regarded as the beginning of Penda's ten-year reign. Thus it may be that Penda prevailed not only over the Northumbrians but also over his rivals among the Mercians.|$|R

50|$|Neither Bede, in his Ecclesiastical History of the English People, nor the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle {{mentions}} <b>Eowa's</b> participation {{or death}} at Maserfield, or his previously being a Mercian king, but the Chronicle later mentions him when tracing the descent of Æthelbald and Offa.|$|R
5000|$|Nicholas Brooks wrote that, if <b>Eowa</b> is {{considered}} to have ruled during the period between roughly 635 and Maserfield, this could account for an obscure recorded Welsh raid into Mercian territory, during which {{it is said that}} no mercy was shown to [...] "book-holding monks". Brooks noted that if <b>Eowa</b> was a Northumbrian puppet, there would be the possibility that Oswald may have made moves to promote Christianity in Mercia at this time, thus accounting for the presence of monks in what was still a pagan kingdom. Since Penda is known to history as an ally of the Welsh, this along with the presence of monks makes it seem unlikely that the raid could have taken place during his rule.|$|R
500|$|The {{traditional}} {{identification of}} the battle site with Oswestry, probably in the territory of Powys at the time, suggests that Penda may have had British allies in this battle, and this is also suggested by surviving Welsh poetry which has been thought to indicate {{the participation of the}} men of Powys in the battle. It has also been considered that, if the traditional {{identification of the}} site as Oswestry is correct, Oswald was on the offensive, in the territory of his enemies. This could conflict with Bede's saintly portrayal of Oswald, since an aggressive war could hardly qualify as a just war, perhaps explaining why Bede is silent on the cause of the war—he says only that Oswald died [...] "fighting for his fatherland"—as well as his failure to mention other offensive warfare Oswald is presumed to have engaged in between Heavenfield and Maserfield. Oswald may have had an ally in Penda's brother <b>Eowa,</b> who was also killed in the battle, according to the Historia Britonnum and Annales Cambriae; while the source only mentions that <b>Eowa</b> was killed, not the side on which he fought, it has been speculated that <b>Eowa</b> was subject to Oswald and fighting alongside him in the battle, in opposition to Penda.|$|R
5|$|Offa's ancestry {{is given}} in the Anglian collection, a set of genealogies that include lines of descent for four Mercian kings. All four lines descend from Pybba, who ruled Mercia early in the 7th century. Offa's line descends through Pybba's son <b>Eowa</b> and then through three more generations: Osmod, Eanwulf and Offa's father, Thingfrith. Æthelbald, who ruled Mercia {{for most of the}} forty years before Offa, was also descended from <b>Eowa</b> {{according}} to the genealogies: Offa's grandfather, Eanwulf, was Æthelbald's first cousin. Æthelbald granted land to Eanwulf in the territory of the Hwicce, and it is possible that Offa and Æthelbald were from the same branch of the family. In one charter Offa refers to Æthelbald as his kinsman, and Headbert, Æthelbald's brother, continued to witness charters after Offa rose to power.|$|R
