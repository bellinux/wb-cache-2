2500|$|On October 3, 2009, {{an online}} column by Fox Sports {{baseball}} writer Ken Rosenthal reported of a mutiny in the Blue Jays' clubhouse against Gaston by his players and {{some members of}} his coaching staff. Rosenthal cited unnamed sources who claimed that the mutiny {{was a result of}} his impatience with the players after they started losing, partially reflected with players getting less playing time, his lack of communication, including his inability to properly communicate substitutions, and his negativity, especially {{when it came to the}} younger players who required more positive reinforcement. A day after the report, Blue Jays first baseman Lyle Overbay was quoted as being one of the players who was surprised over his lack of playing time as well as wanting Gaston to improve his communication. [...] "More than anything, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> figure out what to expect for next year. It kind of caught me off-guard a little bit when I wasn't playing. ... (Gaston) never really said a lot. As we were winning, he was kind of sitting on the back burner, watching us play good." [...] When asked about the report on the clubhouse mutiny, Gaston replied that he was surprised that such criticism existed. [...] "If you've got two or three or four guys in there that have a problem, then you don't have to win anything, do you? You might have to certainly deal with those guys, but you don't have to win the clubhouse back. I don't think that you can ... rely (on a few) players to find out (if there's a problem). I think you need to talk to all of them. If it comes up to 50 percent, then, hey, maybe we've got a problem. I'd like to know what the problem is because I can't be any fairer than I've been." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I do, Gran'pa Jim," [...] {{she replied}} soberly, [...] "and I thank you, too. It {{has been a}} trial for both of us, but we've been really helpful to poor Alora. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> bring a little {{happiness}} into her life and encourage her to become as sweet and lovable a girl as she has the nature to be, and this could never have been accomplished had we allowed her to drift in the sole companionship of her disagreeable father." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why?" [...] he answered. [...] "Because I want to see, to know, to learn. And when I {{have learned}} and seen and known, I want {{other people to}} see and to learn and to know. I want to write it all down, all the vast palpitating picture of it. Ah! if I only could--I want to see" [...] (and here he passed {{his hand through his}} hair as if trying to remember) [...] "something of the {{relations}} of labour and capital, of the extraordinary development of industrial machinery, of the new and intricate organisation of corporation finance, and in particular <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> analyse--no one has ever done it yet--the men who guide and drive it all. I want to set down the psychology of the multimillionaire!" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{always feel}} sentimental myself after dinner. It {{is the only}} time when I can {{properly}} appreciate love-stories. Then, when the hero clasps [...] "her" [...] to his heart in one last wild embrace and stifles a sob, I feel as sad as though I had dealt at whist and turned up only a deuce; and when the heroine dies in the end I weep. If I read the same tale early in the morning I should sneer at it. Digestion, or rather indigestion, has a marvelous effect upon the heart. If I want to write any thing very pathetic--I mean, if <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> write anything very pathetic--I eat a large plateful of hot buttered muffins about an hour beforehand, and then by the time I sit down to my work a feeling of unutterable melancholy has come over me. I picture heartbroken lovers parting forever at lonely wayside stiles, while the sad twilight deepens around them, and only the tinkling of a distant sheep-bell breaks the sorrow-laden silence. Old men sit and gaze at withered flowers till their sight is dimmed by the mist of tears. Little dainty maidens wait and watch at open casements; but [...] "he cometh not," [...] and the heavy years roll by and the sunny gold tresses wear white and thin. The babies that they dandled have become grown men and women with podgy torments of their own, and the playmates that they laughed with are lying very silent under the waving grass. But still they wait and watch, till the dark shadows of the unknown night steal up and gather round them and the world with its childish troubles fades from their aching eyes.|$|E
6000|$|Washington, March 2, 1864. DEAR MOTHER--You or Jeff {{must try}} to write {{as soon as you}} receive this and let me know how little Sis is. Tell me if she got entirely over the croup and how she is--also about George's trunks. I do hope he {{received}} them; it was such a misfortune; I want to hear the end of it; I am in hopes I shall hear that he has got them. I have not seen in the papers whether the 51st has left New York yet. Mother, I want to hear all about home and all the occurrences, especially the two things I have just mentioned, and how you are, for somehow I was thinking from your letters lately whether you was as well as usual or not. Write how my dear sister Mat is too, and whether you are still going to stay there in Portland avenue the coming year. Well, dear mother, I am just the same here--nothing new. I am well and hearty, and constantly moving around among the wounded and sick. There are a great many of the latter coming up--the hospitals here are quite full--lately they have [been] picking out in the hospitals all that had pretty well recovered, and sending them back to their regiments. They seem to be determined to strengthen the army this spring to the utmost. They are sending down many to their reg'ts that are not fit to go in my opinion--then there are squads and companies, and reg'ts, too, passing through here in one steady stream, going down to the front, returning from furlough home; but then there are quite a number leaving the army on furlough, re-enlisting, and going North for a while. They pass through here quite largely. Mother, Lewis Brown is getting quite well; he will soon {{be able to have a}} wooden leg put on. He is very restless and active, and wants to go round all the time. Sam Beatty is here in Washington. We have had quite a snow storm, but [it] is clear and sunny to-day here, but sloshy. I am wearing my army boots--anything but the dust. Dear Mother, I want to see you and Sis and Mat and all very much. If I can get a chance I think I shall come home for a while. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> bring out a book of poems, a new one, to be called [...] "Drum-Taps," [...] and I want to come to New York for that purpose, too.|$|E

5000|$|Rey {{has been}} quoted {{describing}} his sound as [...] "...more {{of the experimental}} type; I don't like to tie myself down to just one genre. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> everything. I'm actually just now starting to listen to some country music so I can cater {{to that kind of}} artist. It may not end up being my thing, but <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> it first and see how it goes. I tend to favor pop, only because I like to mash hip hop drums with pop sounds." [...] His production is based around an alternative keyboard.|$|R

I want the Germans {{to get to know}} us, because the unknown is scary and produces hate, as you can see based on the demonstrations against the Turks. Because of that I show the circumstances of the foreign workers in Germany based on this example without even leaving the apartment.|$|E

Then they say, 'Can’t you write another?' But if I write a sequel, let me predict what readers will say. They’ll say, ‘Well, it was good, but {{not as good as}} Lamb.’ Why would <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> outdo Lamb and then fail and ruin it for everyone?

5000|$|Genderbending may be political, {{stemming}} from the early identity politics movements of the 1960s and 1970s, a guiding principle {{of which is the}} idea that the personal is political. In his 1974 article, Genderfuck and Its Delights, Christopher Lonc explained his motivation for performing genderfuck: [...] "I want to criticize and poke fun at the roles of women and of men too. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> show how not-normal I can be. I want to ridicule and destroy the whole cosmology of restrictive sex roles and sexual identification." ...|$|E
5000|$|JR {{considers}} himself as [...] "neither a street artist nor a photographer". To {{carry out his}} projects, he uses photography but also video, prints on paper or tarpaulins, urban spaces, books and especially social links. JR noted [...] "I would like to bring art to improbable places, create projects so huge with the community that {{they are forced to}} ask themselves questions. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> create images of hot spots such as the Middle East or Brazil that offer different points of view from the ones we see in the worldwide media which are often caricatures." ...|$|E
5000|$|On 10 February 2011, Ivanović {{signed a}} new five-and-a-half-year-contract with Chelsea, keeping {{him at the}} club until the summer of 2016.

[...] He also added, [...] "These things take a little time but my first vision was always to stay with Chelsea. There were not a lot of problems because I wanted to stay, the club wanted me to stay and I want to thank everyone who helped with the deal. I am very happy with that." [...] He ended the season by being one of three nominations for Chelsea Player of the Year, losing out in the end to goalkeeper Petr Čech.|$|E

5000|$|Aaron {{decided to}} modify his {{approach}} to quad jumps, stating in August 2016: [...] "I'm using an inside three turn (entrance). ...

5000|$|After the Beijing Olympics, Tweddle {{decide to}} contentrate her {{training}} on uneven bars and floor. She said, [...] "I thought I would retire this year but then I {{was so close}} in Beijing {{that there is still}} some unfinished business. Now I don't really know when I'll stop. To be honest 2012 is in my sights now which it wasn't this time last year. We will just have to see how my body holds up but that's the goal. As long as I'm still enjoying it and still up there challenging then I'll keep going. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> prove everyone wrong and get that Olympic medal. I've been working closely with both my coach and my physio to keep my body going. My training has changed a lot and I only do bars and floor seriously now. Beam and vault are the ones which hurt my feet and I can't really upgrade enough to be up there to contend for the all around anymore. I've also changed my training partner and now I train with Hannah Whelan. The variety has given me a new lease of life." ...|$|E

In this short comment, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> complicate this somewhat undifferentiated account of the first twenty years after the war.
