40|$|Abstract: Mangosteen rind (MSR) (Garcinia mangostana L.) is a {{predominant}} {{component of}} the fruit contributing to 62 % of the whole <b>fruit.</b> However, <b>utilization</b> of {{the same for the}} preparation of health products was not explored due to its sensorially less acceptable parameters. Differential extraction in different polarity solvents of MSR was done and evaluated their acceptability for product preparation. Current study thus is a detailed investigation on bioactivity profiling of MSR fraction and utilization of the same for health product preparation. Among various extracts, 70 % ethanol (70 %AE) yielded the maximum (15 g/ 100 g). Xanthone:Phenolic ratio was 1 : 2. 8, in 70 %AE as opposed to hot water extract – HWE and 50 % AE, which contained Xanthone:Phenolic ratio of 1 : 1. 4 / 5. Higher the phenolic content obviously reduces the bitterness of Xanthones. 70 % AE contained phenolics 60. 08 ± 0. 213 mg/g and xanthones 22. 56 ± 0. 317 mg/g.

Uneaten fruit samples from Washington hawthorn (Crataegus phaeropyrum), crabapple (Malus sp.), serviceberry (Amelanchier canadensis), and Japanese scholar tree (Sophora japonica) sources along with corresponding resultant fecal waste samples were analyzed for dry mass content of Na+, K+, Mg 2 +, Ca 2 + and N. Waxwing intakes of each nutrient were also compared with known requirements for growing eastern bluebirds. Findings suggest that waxwings are in positive balance for K+, Mg 2 +, and Ca 2 + for the tested winter and spring fruits and that three of the four tested fruits may be adequate in maintaining a nitrogen budget. Winter retained hawthorn fruit may not be an adequate source of Na+. All other nutrients tested in both winter retained fruit diets showed positive balance for wild waxwings.

The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the utilization of prickly pear fruit solids in extruded food products. Peeled prickly pear fruits were ground to form a paste. This paste was strained to remove the seeds and then mixed with rice flour in three different solid ratios. The three blends were dried to a moisture level of 13 % (w/w basis) and ground to form fine flour. These feed mixes were extruded in a twin screw extruder (Clextral EV- 25) at a feed rate of 15 kg/h, feed moisture content of 13 % (w/w), screw speed of 400 rpm and L/D ratio of 40 : 1. The temperature profile from feed to die end was maintained as: 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 100, 120, 140 ºC. The extruded products were analyzed for physical and textural properties.

This study was undertaken to examine the possibility of utilizing peach pomace {{as a source of}} soluble dietary fiber in expanded extruded food products. Peach pomace was combined with rice flour at four different levels. The four blends were mixed, dried to a moisture level of 13. 5 % (w/w) and ground to flour. These blends were extruded in a twin-screw extruder (Clextral EV- 25) at a feed flow rate of 15 kg/h. The extruded products were analyzed for physical and textural properties. The apparent and true densities for the extrudates decreased from 183. 93 to 133. 94 kg/m 3 and 1275. 31 to 1171. 2 kg/m 3, respectively. A linear increase in extrudate porosity (85. 11 - 88. 54 %) and radial expansion ratio (13. 5 - 19. 3) and a steady decrease in breaking strength (104 - 50. 74 kPa) were observed with increasing peach pomace level in the blends.

Likewise, fruits were inventoried and sampled to augment trap data and generate information on the spatial patterns of fruiting phenology and <b>fruit</b> <b>utilization</b> among fruit flies. In 1991 – 1992 and 1995, trap catches indicated that B. dorsalis and B. cucurbitae had similar seasonal population trends and were caught in highest density in residential and wild guava areas. However, the mean catch/trap/day for B. dorsalis (654 ± 493. 73) was ca. 40 -fold higher than B. cucurbitae (31. 4 ± 15. 28). Only 1 C. capitata was caught in a coffee tree, Coffea arabica L., in Kalaupapa Settlement on December 12, 1995.

40|$|ABSTRACT Bacterial fruit blotch (BFB) of cucurbit {{plants is}} caused by Acidovorax citrulli and {{represents}} a serious concern to melon (Cucumis melo L.) growers worldwide, including those in Brazil. Thirty-four A. citrulli strains from different melon production areas of northeastern Brazil were characterized for their virulence on melon fruits and their substrate utilization and molecular profiles. Based on the analysis of BFB severity on melon fruits, the A. citrulli strains were divided into three groups, classified as mildly, moderately or highly virulent. Although host-related groups were not observed, the watermelon and &# 8216;melão-pepino&# 8217; strains exhibited only low or moderate virulence on melon <b>fruit.</b> Substrate <b>utilization</b> profiles revealed that 94 % of the 95 tested compounds were used by A. citrulli strains as a carbon source. Overall, based on substrate utilization, low variability was observed with no relationship to host of origin. The formation of one group of A. citrulli strains based on Repetitive Sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) analysis confirmed the low variability observed in the substrate utilization analyses. Bayesian inference based on the analysis of 23 S rDNA partial sequence data resulted in one well-supported clade and clustered the strains with the A. citrulli-type species with high posterior probability support. Based on the markers used, the Brazilian A. citrulli strains belong to a single group, which corresponds to the previously described Group I for this bacterium in the United States...|$|R

In a preliminary experiment, the dried petioles of water hyacinth (DWH) absorbed urine in a mean rate of 18. 78 ml·g - 1 within 7 d, retrieving about 3. 46 % urine dissolved solids (UDS). In an advanced experiment, the DWH’s capacity of urine absorption declined from an initial 2. 73 L·kg - 1 ·d - 1 to 0. 68 L·kg - 1 ·d - 1, with a requirement of material change in about 25 effective days and an average ratio of 25 (L) to 1 (kg). Phosphorus (P 2 O 5) concentration in the adsorbent increased from 0. 46 % (material baseline) to 3. 14 % (end product), suggesting a satisfactory recovery of the element.

Measuring the propagation of the label through metabolic networks may provide information on carbon allocation in sink fruit during fruit development. In this research, gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry based metabolite profiling was used to characterize the changing metabolic pool sizes in developing apple fruit at five growth stages (30, 58, 93, 121, and 149 days after full bloom) using 13 C-isotope feeding experiments on hypanthium tissue discs. Following the feeding of [U- 13 C]glucose, the 13 C-label was incorporated into the various metabolites to different degrees depending on incubation time, metabolic pathway activity, and growth stage. Evidence is presented that early in <b>fruit</b> development the <b>utilization</b> of the imported sugars was faster than in later developmental stages, likely to supply the energy and carbon skeletons required for cell division and fruit growth.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} {{interest in the}} commericalization of native <b>fruits</b> for <b>utilization</b> as foods and medicinal extracts. This study was undertaken to determine the physicochemical properties and phenolic composition of selected Saskatchewan native fruits, including buffaloberry (Shepherdia argentea Nutt.), chokecherry (Prunus virginiana L.) and sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.). The physicochemical analyses included carbohydrate content, CIELAB colour values, organic acid composition, phenolic content, % seed, soluble solids, pH, total solids, total titratable acidity and proximate composition. Fruit samples were collected and analyzed over four crop years. The proanthocyanidin content was also determined photometrically after acid depolymerization in acid-butanol. Buffaloberry contained a proanthocyanidin concentration of 505 ± 32 mg/ 100 g fresh fruit and this level was 10 fold {{higher than that of}} chokecherry and sea buckthorn. Chokecherry was found to contain an anthocyanin concentration of 255 ± 35 mg/ 100 g fresh fruit, as determined using the pH differential method. Two high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods were developed for simultaneous determination of seven phenolic classes, including anthocyanins, hydroxybenzoic acids, hydroxycinnamic acids, flavanols, flavanones, flavones and flavonols in aqueous methanol extracts. Based on the semi-quantitative analysis of the total phenolic chromatographic index (TPCI), chokecherry contained the highest levels of phenolic compounds with a concentration of 3, 327 ± 469 µg/g fresh fruit followed by buffaloberry (578 ± 73 µg/g fresh fruit) and sea buckthorn (477 ± µg/g fresh fruit). The antioxdant activity of the fruit extracts was determined using 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2, 2 ´-azinobis- 3 -ethylbenzthiazoline-sulphonic acid (ABTS) radical scavenging assays. Buffaloberry and chokecherry produced the highest radical scavenging activity and were at least five fold greater than that of sea buckthorn. The major radical scavenging compounds in buffaloberry were ascorbic acid and proanthocyanidins. Radical scavenging activity of chokecherry fruit was largely attributable to its anthocyanins, flavonols and hydroxycinnamic acids. Prominent antioxidants in sea buckthorn included ascorbic acid, proanthocyanidins and flavonols. Certain individual compounds in the phenolic extracts were identified by HPLC-photodiode array and HPLC-mass spectrometry. Rutin was found in all of the extracts. Other phenolic compounds identified included catechin in sea buckthorn, and chlorogenic acid and quercetin in chokecherry. The chokecherry fruit pigments were comprised of two major anthocyanins and these were identified as cyanidin 3 -glucoside and cyanidin 3 -rutinoside. A preparative scale purification method for these anthocyanins using centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC) was determined. Under the CPC conditions employed, cyanidin 3 -glucoside and cyanidin 3 -rutinoside were purified to concentrations of 84 and 90 %, respectively...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} still less expolited species of small fruit, {{evaluation}} of its {{physical and chemical}} parameters and proposal of a new soft drink {{from one of the}} studied species of furit. Firstly, for the characterisation of basic nutrition parameters (dry matter, content of organic acids and saccharides) and biologicaly active substances (vitamin C, anthocyanins and phenolic compounds) suitable titration, spectrophotometric, chromatographic and electrophoretic methods were chosen, optimized and validated. The sample preparation procedure was optimized as well. For three years (2010 – 2012) the content of listed parameters was monitored in some cultivars of five species of small fruit: in seven cultivars of sea buckthorn, in ten cultivars of cornelian cherry, in twelve cultivars of rowanberry, in two cultivars of chokeberry and in seventeen cultivars of elderberry. By means of Duncan’s test, analysis of principal components (PCA) and cluster analysis (CLU) the main differences between studied cultivars were observed mainly in sea buckthorn and rowanberry, where single cultivars were easily distinguishable from others on the basis of genetic origin. On the basis of comparison of determined parameters in studied species of fruit and with collaboration with fruit processing company the suitable species of <b>fruit</b> for commercial <b>utilization</b> was chosen – elderberry, as a important source of anthocyanins and phenolic compounds. A new soft drink as a proposal of <b>utilization</b> of this <b>fruit</b> was created – fruit juice or nectar with portion of elderberry juice. Mixed juices and nectars with various composition were prepared from elderberry and grape juice and the sensory analysis of these drinks was performed. The best evaluated were 100 % fruit juices prepared with 30 – 50 % portion of elderberry juice. The composition was jurally protected. On the basis of this protection the product consisted from 100 % fruit juice with 10 % of elderberry component mixed with apple and grape juice was introduced to the market by the fruit processing company...|$|R

The author takes the phenomenon of research on the effectiveness of Rural Assistance and community participation in rural {{infrastructure development}} to determine the publics assessment of the effectiveness of Rural Assistance, as well as public participation in the development of rural infrastructure in the Sekodi village, this study used a quantitative descriptive analysis and establish a sample of 71 people Head Families (HF) were taken from every Cluster in the village sekodi namely: Cluster in Tanjung sekodi 15 % x 197 HF= 30 people, 15 % Cluster in Nyatuh x 169 HF = 25 people, cluster in Permai 15 % x 109 HF = 16 people. The results showed that, People consider that Rural Assistance still less effective that show in terms of presence on duty in the village, facilitation of planning, implementation, monitoring, communication, still considered less good, although that some people have assessed the development of socialization, planning assistance, ability, and responsibility, results {{in the presence of a}} companion rural development in the construction of the village was considered quite good companion, even the public judge for sustainability of care in the village is still part of the population (respondents) who agreed to 45. 1 % and the others were agreed 45. 1 % and 9. 9 % did not agree. while participation in the development of rural infrastructure in sekodi Village still moderate that show of participation in the meetings, mutual assistance, self-power, responsibility,supervision, delivery cheating, keep the <b>fruits</b> of development, <b>utilization</b> of the results, as well as overseeing the development was considered quite active, although the submission of ideas (the proposed development), self-funding, self-help materials assessed to be less active.
