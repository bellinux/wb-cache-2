2500|$|In February 2014, {{after three}} {{consecutive}} years of below-normal rainfall, California faced its most severe drought emergency in decades with fish {{populations in the}} Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta in unprecedented crisis due to the decades of massive water exports from Northern California to south of the Delta via state and federal water projects. “Fisheries... people and economic prosperity of northern California are at grave risk", per Bill Jennings, <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>California</b> Sportfishing Protection Alliance [...] Half a million acres of Central Valley farmland supposedly {{was in danger of}} going fallow due to drought. On 5 February 2014 the House passed a bill to increase flows from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta to the Central Valley, the Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley Emergency Water Delivery Act (H.R. 3964; 113th Congress). This would suspend the very recent efforts to restore the San Joaquin River since 2009, won after 18 years of litigation, with increased releases from the Friant Dam east of Fresno. Democratic Senators Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer proposed emergency drought legislation of $300 million aid, and to speed up environmental reviews of water projects, so state and federal officials have [...] "operational flexibility" [...] to move water south, from the delta to San Joaquin Valley farms.|$|E
