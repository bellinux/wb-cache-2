5|$|Herpes simplex is a {{viral disease}} {{caused by the}} herpes simplex virus. Infections are {{categorized}} based {{on the part of the}} body infected. Oral herpes involves the face or mouth. It may result in small blisters in groups often called cold sores or fever blisters or may just cause a sore throat. Genital herpes, often simply known as herpes, may have minimal symptoms or form blisters that break open and result in small ulcers. These typically heal over two to four weeks. Tingling or shooting pains may occur before the blisters appear. Herpes cycles between periods of active disease followed by periods without symptoms. The first episode is often more severe and may be associated with fever, muscle pains, swollen lymph nodes and headaches. Over time, episodes of active disease decrease in frequency and severity. Other disorders caused by herpes simplex include: herpetic whitlow when it involves the fingers, herpes of the eye, <b>herpes</b> <b>infection</b> of the brain, and neonatal herpes when it affects a newborn, among others.|$|E
25|$|Vaginal {{delivery}} is contraindicated (e.g., invasive cervical carcinoma, active genital <b>herpes</b> <b>infection,</b> total placenta previa, vasa previa, cord presentation or prolapse).|$|E
25|$|Depending on the STI, {{a person}} may {{still be able to}} spread the {{infection}} if no signs of disease are present. For example, a person is much more likely to spread <b>herpes</b> <b>infection</b> when blisters are present than when they are absent. However, a person can spread HIV infection at any time, even if he/she has not developed symptoms of AIDS.|$|E
40|$|We {{analyzed}} data on genital <b>herpes</b> <b>infections</b> in the United States from 1966 to 1981 {{collected by}} the National Disease and Therapeutic Index survey. The number of private physician-patient consultations for genital herpes increased tenfold during this period. The number of patient visits for newly diagnosed infections increased 7. 5 -fold. Women aged 20 to 24 years and men aged 25 to 29 years {{were more likely to}} consult a private physician for genital herpes than were patients in other age brackets. Our analysis suggests an increasing national incidence of genital <b>herpes</b> <b>infections</b> and supports the concept that genital <b>herpes</b> <b>infections</b> are epidemic in the United States...|$|R
25|$|The {{number of}} genital <b>herpes</b> <b>infections</b> {{appears to be}} rising in New Zealand with three times more cases in 1993 {{compared}} to 1977. In this country, HSV-2 affects 60% {{more women than men}} of similar age.|$|R
5|$|Evidence {{supports}} {{the use of}} acyclovir and valacyclovir {{in the treatment of}} herpes labialis as well as <b>herpes</b> <b>infections</b> in people with cancer. The evidence to support the use of acyclovir in primary herpetic gingivostomatitis is weaker.|$|R
25|$|In another study, 73 {{subjects}} were randomized to receive valaciclovir 1 g daily or placebo for 60 days each in a 2-way crossover design. A daily swab of the genital area was self-collected for HSV-2 detection by polymerase chain reaction, {{in order to}} compare the effect of valaciclovir 1 g once daily for 60 days versus placebo on asymptomatic viral shedding in immunocompetent, HSV-2 seropositive subjects without a history of symptomatic genital <b>herpes</b> <b>infection.</b> The study found that valaciclovir significantly reduced shedding during subclinical days compared to placebo, showing a 71% reduction. 84% of subjects had no shedding while receiving valaciclovir versus 54% of subjects on placebo. 88% of patients treated with valaciclovir had no recognized signs or symptoms versus 77% for placebo.|$|E
25|$|HSV-1 and -2 are {{transmitted}} by {{contact with an}} infected person who has reactivations of the virus. Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2 is periodically shed in the human genital tract, most often asymptomatically. Most sexual transmissions occur during periods of asymptomatic shedding. Asymptomatic reactivation means that the virus causes atypical, subtle or hard to notice symptoms that are not identified as an active <b>herpes</b> <b>infection.</b> Meaning, {{it is possible to}} acquire the virus even if no active HSV blisters or sores are present. In one study, daily genital swab samples found HSV-2 at a median of 12–28% of days among those who have had an outbreak, and 10% of days among those suffering from asymptomatic infection, with many of these episodes occurring without visible outbreak ("subclinical shedding").|$|E
2500|$|Herpes simplex viruses {{can affect}} areas of skin exposed to {{contact with an}} {{infected}} person (although shaking hands with an infected person does not transmit this disease) [...] An {{example of this is}} herpetic whitlow which is a <b>herpes</b> <b>infection</b> on the fingers. This was a common affliction of dental surgeons prior to the routine use of gloves when conducting treatment on patients.|$|E

40|$|A {{clinical}} trial was undertaken {{to compare the}} efficacy of neutral red photodynamic inactivation treatment of genital <b>herpes</b> <b>infections</b> {{with that of a}} non-photoactive dye, phenol red, as a control. In a series of nineteen patients with virologically proven herpes genitalis who were adequately followed, eleven were treated with neutral red, and eight with phenol red; no difference in response to therapy was found between the two groups, and it is concluded that under the conditions of this trial neutral red with photoinactivation was not effective in the treatment of acute genital <b>herpes</b> <b>infections.</b> Approximately 75 per cent. of those with vulval lesions also had concurrent cervical infection, so that an effective topical treatment would need to be applicable to both anatomical sites...|$|R
5000|$|After {{recovery}} from a primary <b>herpes</b> <b>infection,</b> {{the virus is}} not cleared from the body, but rather lies dormant in a non-replicating state within the trigeminal ganglion.|$|E
50|$|However, as with shingles, {{the lack}} of lesions does not {{definitely}} exclude {{the existence of a}} <b>herpes</b> <b>infection.</b> Even before the eruption of vesicles, varicella zoster virus can be detected from the skin of the ear.|$|E
50|$|<b>Herpes</b> <b>infection</b> of {{the nipple}} can go unnoticed because the lesions are small but usually are quite painful. Herpes in the newborn {{is a serious}} and {{sometimes}} fatal infection. Transmission of Hepatitis C and B to the infant can occur if the nipples are cracked.|$|E

40|$|<b>Herpes</b> zoster <b>infection</b> {{and stroke}} are highly {{prevalent}} in the general population; however, reports have presented inconsistent findings regarding the relationship between <b>herpes</b> zoster <b>infection</b> and stroke. In this meta-analysis, we aimed to clarify this association. The PubMed and Embase databases were searched for studies published from their inception to January 2016. Two investigators independently extracted the data. The pooled relative risk (RR) was calculated using a random effects model. A total of 8 studies met the inclusion criteria. During the first 1 month after <b>herpes</b> zoster <b>infection,</b> the pooled RRs for ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke were 1. 55 (95 % CI, 1. 46 - 1. 65) and 1. 70 (95 % CI, 0. 73 - 3. 96), respectively, and within 3 months after infection, the corresponding RRs were 1. 17 (95 % CI, 1. 12 - 1. 23) and 2. 05 (95 % CI, 1. 17 - 3. 60), respectively. At 1 year and more than 1 year after <b>herpes</b> zoster <b>infection,</b> a significant relationship was not observed between <b>herpes</b> zoster <b>infection</b> and the incidence of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Publication bias was not observed. The accumulated evidence generated from this systematic review indicates that an increased risk for ischemic stroke occurred {{in the short term}} after <b>herpes</b> zoster <b>infection,</b> whereas a significant relationship was not observed in the long term after infection. With respect to hemorrhagic stroke, the association was not significant.

40|$|Twenty {{patients}} undergoing allogeneic {{bone marrow}} transplantation and 39 patients receiving remission induction chemotherapy for acute leukaemia were entered into a double blind, placebo controlled stratified trial of acyclovir prophylaxis against <b>herpes</b> group virus <b>infections.</b> Within the transplant group intravenous acyclovir 5 mg/kg twice daily given throughout the period of granulocytopenia completely prevented oropharyngeal <b>herpes</b> simplex virus <b>infection</b> compared with a 50 % incidence in the placebo arm (p = 0. 033). The acyclovir group also had fewer days of fever during the trial and a shorter duration of leukopenia, possibly because of the prevention of <b>herpes</b> simplex virus <b>infections.</b> There was {{a high incidence of}} <b>herpes</b> <b>infections</b> after the trial in patients who received either acyclovir or placebo. In the non-transplant group there was also a significant reduction of <b>herpes</b> simplex virus <b>infection</b> in the oropharynx and oesophagus (two out of 19 patients as compared with 10 out of 20; p = 0. 018). Herpes simplex virus was isolated in the acyclovir arm within a day after starting the trial in one patient, and the other failure was due to a virus with reduced sensitivity to acyclovir in a patient who had had several previous courses of the drug. The incidence of <b>herpes</b> <b>infections</b> after stopping treatment was low. The influence of acyclovir on excretion of Epstein-Barr virus in saliva in either group was inconclusive. One patient (transplant group) developed a cytomegalovirus infection while receiving acyclovir. Acyclovir provides effective prophylaxis against oropharyngeal and oesophageal <b>herpes</b> simplex virus <b>infection</b> in severely immunocompromised seropositive (greater than or equal to 1 / 8) patients. In patients given bone marrow transplants this may have the additional benefit of reducing the time to recovery of an adequate blood count and the number of days of fever...|$|R
