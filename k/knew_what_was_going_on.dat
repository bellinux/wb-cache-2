5|$|By 1944, the SS-TV {{had been}} {{organized}} into three divisions: {{staff of the}} concentration camps in Germany and Austria, in the occupied territories, and of the extermination camps in Poland. By 1944, it became standard practice to rotate SS members {{in and out of}} the camps, partly based on manpower needs, but also to provide easier assignments to wounded Waffen-SS members. This rotation of personnel meant that nearly the entire SS <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> inside the concentration camps, making the entire organization liable for war crimes and crimes against humanity.|$|E
5|$|Gloria confides in Lewis {{that she}} is dying and he {{provides}} her with support. When she asks him to run away with her, he turns her down and tells her he loves Audrey. Lewis then learns that Gloria is not ill and she and Gail were testing his loyalty to Audrey. Lewis is outraged when he realises Audrey <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> and breaks up with her. He then gets revenge on Gloria by revealing that she has cheated in the local pub of the year competition. Lewis gets his job back at The Bistro and he moves into a flat on Victoria Street. Lewis begins to formulate a plan {{to get back at}} Gail for ruining his relationship with Audrey. He decides to use her guilt against her. One night at the Bistro, he pretends to slip and hurt his back. Gail takes pity on Lewis and allows him to stay with her, while she cares for him. During his time with Gail, Lewis offers her his support and advice about her problems. Lewis is not happy when he sees Audrey on a date with another man.|$|E

Every {{member of the group}} <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on.</b> These weapons had been selected before they set off. The knife was far too big to be hidden from the others. There is no doubt there was a hunting party looking for a victim." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} {{inspired}} by the [...] "special relationship" [...] that was developing between Geri Halliwell and Rowe. Brown hinted at this development in her autobiography commenting: [...] "When he [...] and Geri started making eyes at each other I <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> even though they denied it. I knew them both too well for it to be a secret for me." [...] Stannard commented about the fondness between Halliwell and Rowe: [...] "I don't {{want to get into the}} side of things. They were very close. They clicked. And I think the lyrics in [...] "2 Become 1" [...] came from that, especially the first verse, which they wrote together." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by series creator Chris Carter and {{directed}} by Rob Bowman. Bowman was {{not a fan of}} the episode, saying [...] "The show proved to be much more difficult than I anticipated, and there wasn't enough time to shoot the show properly because we were so close to the Christmas break. I felt extremely pressured and frustrated, although there are things in it I love, particularly the banter between Mulder and Scully. But overall, I thought the show was very oblique. I don't feel that the characters ever <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> and I don't think it is all that cool that kids are murdering people. I didn't feel like I was shooting an episode of the X-Files, and I think I let Chris Carter down a bit." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite having Kevin Harvick {{filling his}} {{rearview}} mirror, Dale Earnhardt, Jr. {{was able to}} maintain the lead to complete the first Pocono sweep since Denny Hamlin did it in 2006. [...] "We definitely went home from the last race and made our car better," [...] Earnhardt Jr. said [...] "That's what I'm proud of this team for. It takes a really, really smart guy to understand {{what to do to}} take those gambles. Sometimes they pay off, sometimes they don't." [...] "This hasn't been one of my better race tracks and the cars have been fast both races here," [...] Harvick said after finishing runner-up. [...] "Today we were able to capitalize on it and get a good finish." [...] We had a fast car all day. Steve's strategy was perfect at the end. I don't know if anyone <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> there, but it was pretty awesome." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{discussion}} regarding {{her second}} album began, Duff {{said she wanted}} to work with the same team of producers and songwriters with whom she worked on Metamorphosis. [...] " [...] made me feel so comfortable and so secure with myself. I loved working with them. I have a great relationship with them. I talk to them ... They <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in my life, what I was going through ... and how I feel inside", Duff said. For songs she did not co-write, Duff discussed her experiences and feelings with the writers and ask them to write songs about them. Members of the creative team behind Metamorphosis who returned for Hilary Duff include Charlie Midnight, John Shanks and Kara DioGuardi (who collaborated on the commercially released singles), Andre Recke, Marc Swersky and Duff's sister Haylie. Hilary said, [...] "I do have a lot to say, and I have a lot going on inside that sometimes is buried and hidden because I'm working so hard, and I don't have time to think about it. But if we sit down and we talk about it and I tell her how I feel and she writes, it'll be good." ...|$|E

60|$|Paul rather uneasily mumbled {{something}} about John Farden, {{and the boys}} clapped their hands, and shouted, so that Alfred, who well <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> raised himself on his pillow and laughed.

60|$|He looked triumphantly at Tommy, who, however, {{instead of}} seeming crestfallen, {{continued}} to bet, {{and now the}} other boys were eager to close with him, for great was their faith in Cathro.

60|$|Sauntering along Harry stopped {{near enough}} {{to one of these}} to hear what they were saying. He learned that the duke had been arrested only that morning. It had been {{effected}} quietly, the doors had again been locked before those in the neighbourhood <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> and a guard had been left inside, partly, it was said, in order that the mansion might be preserved from pillage and be used for public purposes, partly that the young count, who was absent, might be arrested when he returned.|$|E

Marian was anxious to show her affection and sympathy in her manner, but her anxiety only made her cold, and dry, and awkward. Clara was excited and puzzled, Walter was hardly spoken to by father or mother; and when at breakfast on Saturday he spoke of his departure, the silence that he encountered seemed to express that he had much better not have come home at all.|$|E
