50|$|<b>Iotrolan</b> (trade name Isovist) is a radiocontrast agent, a {{substance}} {{used to improve}} the visibility of body structures on images obtained by X-ray techniques. It is particularly used to image spaces surrounding the central nervous system, such as the ventricles, after injection into the cerebrospinal fluid. It {{can also be used}} to image joint spaces and in endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).|$|E
40|$|RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES. The authors {{established}} a rat {{model of the}} twitching reaction to contrast media in striated muscle and investigated the influence of nonionic contrast medium on the twitching reaction regarding the nonionic dimer iodixanol compared with the monomer iohexol and the dimer <b>iotrolan.</b> The authors also studied the influences from the electrolyte additions of iodixanol. METHODS. The interval from start of contrast medium injection to start of head movement was compared for iohexol (140 and 350 mg iodine/mL), iodixanol (150 and 320 mg iodine/mL), and <b>iotrolan</b> (300 mg iodine/mL). Comparison was made with mannitol and mannitol containing the same electrolyte concentrations as iodixanol (150 and 320 mg iodine/mL). RESULTS. No differences in latency period were found between iohexol 140 mg iodine/mL (isotonic) and 350 mg iodine/mL (880 mOsm/kg). Iodixanol caused a lesser effect on the twitching reaction than the iohexol solutions and <b>iotrolan.</b> When the electrolytes of iodixanol were added to mannitol (300 mOsm/kg), there was a later onset of the twitching reaction than with electrolyte-free mannitol. CONCLUSIONS. Differences in latency period caused by a change in osmolality were not found. The interval for a twitching reaction was longer with iodixanol than with iohexol, <b>iotrolan,</b> and iso-osmolar mannitol. The weak effect of the iodixanol solution was probably partially caused by the electrolyte content...|$|E
40|$|The {{contrast}} agent <b>Iotrolan</b> 300 has potential advantages for bronchography over previous agents {{in that it}} can be injected directly through the bronchoscope and it does not obscure bronchoscopic vision or interfere with further bronchoscopic procedures. It was used for selective bronchography in 20 patients with suspected bronchiectasis. Side effects and change in FEV 1 and in arterial oxygen saturation were compared in these patients and in 14 patients undergoing bronchoscopy for suspected carcinoma. Thirteen of the 20 patients undergoing bronchography had side effects, mainly headache, nausea, and a feeling of heat or flushing. The fall in FEV 1 at four hours (0. 3 l) did not differ from the fall in the control group (0. 1 l). The fall in arterial oxygen saturation (SaO 2) during bronchography (9. 4 %) did not differ significantly from the fall during bronchoscopy in the control group (6. 1 %). <b>Iotrolan</b> gave good quality bronchograms, which in all cases provided a diagnosis. <b>Iotrolan</b> appears to be suitable for bronchography by fibreoptic bronchoscope and to be well tolerated...|$|E
40|$|Injection of low and iso-osmolar {{contrast}} medium decreases oxygen {{tension in the}} renal medulla. The oxygen tension (PO 2) in the renal cortex and outer renal medulla in 26 rats was studied by use of oxygen microelectrodes before and after injection of x-ray contrast media (CM). The CM, iopromide, ioxaglate and <b>iotrolan</b> were administrated intravenously in iodine equivalent doses (1, 600 mg iodine/kg body wt). Ringer’s solution {{was used as the}} control. In the outer medulla, all three CM induced a decrease in PO 2 : iopromide (N = 6) from 30 ± 3 to 18 ± 4 mm Hg; ioxaglate (N = 7) from 32 ± 6 to 15 ± 4 mm Hg; and <b>iotrolan</b> (N = 6) from 36 ± 3 to 14 ± 4 mm Hg. All these decreases were significant. After the injection of Ringer’s (N = 7) there was an increase from 34 ± 3 to 35 ± 3 mm Hg. In the cortex a slight decrease was noted after injection of CM, but this was significant only after injection of <b>iotrolan.</b> All tested contrast media decrease PO 2 in the outer renal medulla, which may partly explain {{contrast medium}}-induced acute renal failure...|$|E
40|$|Effects of {{contrast}} media and mannitol on renal medullary blood flow and red cell aggregation in the rat kidney. Hemodynamic factors {{may play a}} role in the development of acute renal failure following administration {{of contrast}} media (CM). In this study the effect of intravenous injection of contrast media and mannitol on red blood cell velocity (VRBC) and red blood cell aggregation in renal medullary vessels was studied in 58 rats. Renal medullary blood flow was investigated by a cross-correlation technique and by a visual aggregation score. The CM, namely diatrizoate, iopromide, iohexol, ioxaglate, <b>iotrolan,</b> were given in iodine equivalent doses (1600 mg/kg body wt). Mannitol (950 mOsm/liter) and Ringer's solution were used as controls. The same vessels were studied 30 minutes before and 30 minutes after injections. VRBC decreased significantly after injection of diatrizoate, iopromide, iohexol, <b>iotrolan</b> and mannitol. Ringer's solution and ioxaglate did not significantly alter medullary blood flow, while <b>iotrolan</b> and mannitol caused the largest decreases in VRBC. All CM and mannitol caused both red cell aggregation and cessation of blood flow. The decrease in blood flow and increase in red blood cell aggregation after injection of CM and mannitol may partly explain the occurrence of contrast medium-induced acute renal failure...|$|E
40|$|Background: Discography and discoblock are imaging {{procedures}} used to diagnose discogenic low back pain. Although needle puncture of the intervertebral disc (IVD) itself induces disc degeneration, the agents {{used in these}} procedures may also have harmful effects on IVD cells. The {{purpose of this study}} was to analyze whether radiocontrast agents and local anesthetic agents have detrimental effects on human nucleus pulposus (NP) cells. Methods: Healthy human NP cells were cultured for 7 days in three-dimensional (3 D) cell–alginate bead composites, and were then exposed to clinically relevant doses of a radiocontrast agent (<b>iotrolan)</b> or local anesthetic (lidocaine or bupivacaine). Cell viability and apoptosis were measured by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. On the basis of caspase expression profiles, the apoptotic pathways activated by the agents were identified by Western blot analysis. Results: The radiocontrast agent <b>iotrolan</b> did not affect NP cell viability or induce apoptosis. In contrast, both the anesthetic agents significantly decreased cell viability and increased the apoptotic cell number in a time- and dose-dependent manner. After 120 min, 2 % lidocaine and 0. 5 % bupivacaine decreased percent live cells to 13 % and 10 %, respectively (p, 0. 05). The number of apoptotic cells was doubled by increasing lidocaine dosage from 1 % to 2 % (23 % and 42 %) and bupivacaine from 0. 25 % to 0. 50 % (25 % and 48 %) (p, 0. 05). Western blot analysis revealed that both anesthetic agents upregulated cleaved caspase- 3 and caspase- 8, whereas only bupivacaine upregulated cleaved caspase- 9...|$|E
40|$|Iodinated {{contrast}} media (ICM) can induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) in renal, myocardial and endothelial cells. Following intravascular injection, circulating immune cells {{are exposed to}} high concentrations of ICM. As neutrophils constitutively undergo apoptosis we hypothesized that ICM may adversely affect neutrophil survival. Our aim {{was to investigate the}} effect of ICM on neutrophil apoptosis. Neutrophils were isolated from healthy subjects and cultured in vitro with ionic (diatrizoate and ioxaglate) and non-ionic (iohexol and <b>iotrolan)</b> ICM. The effect of ICM on neutrophil apoptosis in both unstimulated and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated neutrophils was determined by annexin V flow cytometry. The influence of physicochemical properties of the different ICM on apoptosis of neutrophils was also studied. We further investigated the effects of ICM on key intracellular signal pathways, including p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) by Western blotting, and mitochondrial depolarization and caspase activity by flow cytometry. Isoiodine concentrations (20 mg ml(- 1)) of ionic (diatrizoate 69. 6 +/- 2. 9 %; ioxaglate 58. 9 +/- 2. 0 %) and non-ionic (iohexol 57. 3 +/- 2. 9 %; <b>iotrolan</b> 57. 1 +/- 2. 6 %) ICM significantly induced neutrophil apoptosis over control levels (47. 7 +/- 1. 4 %). The apoptotic effect of ICM was influenced by their chemical structure, with ionic ICM having a more significant (p< 0. 01) apoptotic effect than non-ionic ICM (p< 0. 05). Furthermore, ICM reversed the anti-apoptotic effect of lipopolysaccharide (1000 ng ml(- 1)) treated neutrophils to control levels (23. 0 +/- 3. 5 % to 61. 2 +/- 5. 3 %; n= 4; p< 0. 05). These agents induce apoptosis through a p 38 MAPK independent pathway that results in mitochondrial depolarization, and is dependent on caspase activation. As neutrophils {{play a central role in}} host response to infection and injury, ICM, through induction of neutrophil apoptosis, could have a significant deleterious effect on host immune defence and resolution of an inflammatory response...|$|E
40|$|Multidrug {{resistance}} was an obstacle in cancer chemotherapy because the cells decreased their intracellular drug accumulation by energy-dependent compounds efflux pumps such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp). This study observed some iodinated radiographic contrast media, diatrizoate, iopromide and <b>iotrolan</b> affected the cellular energetic {{state and the}} kinetics of P-gp in drug-sensitive K 562 and drug resistant K 562 /adr cell lines using spectrophotometer and spectrofluorometer. By colorimetric MTT assay, {{it was found that}} contrast media (0 - 3500 µM) had no effect on both K 562 and K 562 /adr cell viabilities, but in co-treatment with daunorubicin (DNR), diatrizoate decreased cell viability in K 562 /adr cells by decreasing IC so of DNR from 610. 7 ± 74. 5 nM to 360 ± 108. 9 nM. The change in cellular energetic state was studied using rhodamine B as a probe to estimate mitochondrial membrane potential (&# 916;&# 936; m). The results showed that 3500 µM diatrizoate decreased &# 916;&# 936; m from 162. 2 ± 0. 3 mV to 86. 9 ± 9. 9 mV in K 562 /adr cells. The kinetics of P-gp-mediated efflux of DNR could be reduced by diatrizoate from 0 (no inhibition) to 0. 65 ± 0. 11. This inhibition could be partially prevented in co-incubation with 20 nM concanamycin A or 10 µM cytochalasin B. Among the three molecules, diatrizoate showed the best efficiency. It could be proposed for further studies that diatrizoate could be used as MDR identification or MDR imaging and also acted as MDR sensitizing agent in cancer treatments...|$|E
