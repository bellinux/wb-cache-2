5|$|Eugene Sack, {{the father}} of Second Circuit Court of Appeals judge Robert D. Sack, joined Landman as rabbi in 1946. While serving as {{assistant}} rabbi of Congregation Rodeph Shalom of Philadelphia, Sack had been instrumental in {{the founding of the}} Reform movement's National Federation of Temple Youth in 1939, and had presented a paper at its first biennial convention. Starting in 1943 he spent 18 months in the Pacific Theater of Operations of World War II as an army chaplain; at one point he had to substitute peach <b>juice</b> <b>for</b> Passover wine.|$|E
5|$|Odwalla was {{incorporated}} in September 1985 {{after five years}} of growth and expanded to sell products in San Francisco in 1988. Hambrecht & Quist Inc., a venture capital firm in San Francisco, was one of Odwalla's main investors at the time, investing several million dollars in the company. By 1992, the company employed 80 people at its company headquarters in Davenport, California, and sold around 20 different flavors of <b>juice</b> <b>for</b> between $1.50 and $2.00 a pint. Odwalla went public in December 1993 (NASDAQ:ODWA); the company had 35 delivery trucks, almost 200 employees, and made about $13million a year. Soon afterwards, Odwalla expanded into new markets when it bought two companies in the Pacific Northwest and Colorado.|$|E
5|$|Further {{changes were}} made to the {{techniques}} used. Each morning, 36 chickens were roasted for their juices rather than the meat being used on the menu. Each chicken was pressed in a colander to ensure that all the liquid was expressed. These juices were mixed with those from the roasting trays after they had been deglazed with Madeira wine and then added a small amount of veal stock. The actual roasted chickens ended up being too dry to serve following the process, and so were used for staff lunches or were discarded. These 36 chickens produced enough <b>juice</b> <b>for</b> the sauces to accompany 30 chicken dishes. Similar processes were conducted with lamb shoulders, where they were pressed only for the creation of sauces.|$|E

25|$|Although {{alcohol is}} {{permitted}} in Judaism, grape juice is sometimes {{used as an}} alternative for kiddush on Shabbat and Jewish holidays, and has the same blessing as wine. Many authorities maintain that grape juice must be capable of turning into wine naturally {{in order to be}} used for kiddush. Common practice, however, is to use any kosher grape <b>juice</b> <b>for</b> kiddush.|$|E
25|$|When rosé wine is {{the primary}} product, it is {{produced}} with the skin contact method. Black-skinned grapes are crushed and the skins are allowed to remain {{in contact with the}} <b>juice</b> <b>for</b> a short period, typically one to three days. The must is then pressed, and the skins are discarded rather than left in contact throughout fermentation (as with red wine making). The longer that the skins are left in contact with the juice, the more intense the color of the final wine.|$|E

25|$|After {{the grape}} harvest in mid-summer, most grapes {{were taken to}} wine presses to extract their <b>juice</b> <b>for</b> winemaking. Once fermented, wine was {{transferred}} to wineskins or large amphorae for storage. Israelite amphorae were typically tall with large handles and little decoration, and the handles were often inscribed {{with the name of}} the city in which the wine had been produced, the winemaker’s stamp and sometimes the year and the vintage. Amphorae made long term storage possible, especially in caves or cool cellars. Glass bottles were introduced only in the 1st century CE by the Romans.|$|E
25|$|The Catholic Church {{continues}} to use {{wine in the}} celebration of the Eucharist because {{it is part of the}} tradition passed down through the ages starting with Jesus Christ at the Last Supper, where Catholics believe the consecrated bread and wine literally become the body and blood of Jesus Christ, a dogma known as transubstantiation. Wine is used (not grape juice) both due to its strong Scriptural roots, and also to follow the tradition set by the early Christian Church. The Code of Canon Law of the Catholic Church (1983), Canon 924 says that the wine used must be natural, made from grapes of the vine, and not corrupt. In some circumstances, a priest may obtain special permission to use grape <b>juice</b> <b>for</b> the consecration; however, this is extremely rare and typically requires sufficient impetus to warrant such a dispensation, such as personal health of the priest.|$|E
25|$|The British wine merchants {{used this}} {{opportunity}} to leverage their strength {{in order to maximize}} profits. In 1727, they grouped together to form a trade association and built the Factory House, a private gentlemen's club, where they could meet and collude on details pertaining to the wine trade. They bought all the wine from growers on credit, holding off payment till the wine was sold. They built large warehouses in Vila Nova de Gaia where they could keep the wine for years aging. Less than scrupulous shippers also committed widespread wine fraud by importing grapes from regions outside the Douro to blend, as well as adding non-grape based wine ingredients like elderberry <b>juice</b> <b>for</b> coloring and dried pimentos to add spicy flavors. These tactics increased the leverage of the British shippers and meant they could set whatever prices they wanted to pay the Portuguese grape growers. To ensure more fair pricing, the growers often had to resort to more unorthodox business dealings such as the prostitution of their daughters to the British shippers.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the absence}} of wine or grape juice, Friday night kiddush may be recited over the challah; the blessing over bread is {{substituted}} for the blessing over wine.
