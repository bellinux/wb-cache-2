Blaine saw in this an issue that would distract from the Grant administration scandals and let the Republican party regain the high moral ground. In December 1875, he proposed a joint resolution that became known as the Blaine Amendment.|$|E

40|$|PublisherTokyoThis article {{compares the}} {{historical}} development of <b>education</b> <b>policies</b> for immigrant children in England and France and reveals {{a lack of}} awareness on the benefits of cultural differentiation in the <b>education</b> <b>policies</b> which are put into practice in these two countries. After a high migratory flow in the 1950 s and the 1960 s, different types of <b>education</b> <b>policies</b> were developed for immigrant children in England and France. The choice between assimilation and cultural pluralism in <b>education</b> <b>policies</b> stems from the ways in which national ideologies have been instructed through the national education. The changes of the organizations in charge of the specific education for immigrant children, which are the Section 11 in England and the EFISEM in France, improved and clarified the normative framework on which the <b>education</b> <b>policies</b> for these children have been based and developed in both countries. However, a sequence of reforms of educational systems in the 1980 s constrained the evolution of <b>education</b> <b>policies</b> for immigrant children which had been based on the traditional framework of reference in both countries. In the same period of time, the settlement of permanent immigrant workers had transformed the characteristics of immigration. Their children were born in host countries and most of them could learn English or French before entering primary school. The educational reforms and the evolution of the beneficiaries of positive <b>education</b> <b>policies</b> have had a remarkable influence upon the perceptions and attitudes of school teachers and other staffs towards these children. As a result of the modified living conditions of immigrant children and the new habits of educational actors, the traditional framework of reference related to the positive <b>education</b> <b>policies</b> had lost its political and pedagogical legitimacy. Therefore, a new framework of reference has been set up in the <b>education</b> <b>policies</b> for immigrant children under the new organizations, which are the EMAG in England and the CASNAV in France after institutional reforms of the Section 11 and the CEFISEM at the beginning of 2000. I would conclude that the current <b>education</b> <b>policies</b> for immigrant children in England and France tend to insist upon the socio-economic elements and a colour-blind approach for a better achievement in their education rather than in their cultural differentiation...|$|R

Public expenditure on education was 13.4percent of total government expenditure and 2.9percent of GDP in 2008.

After Labor's defeat {{at the federal}} election held in September 2013, Gillard penned an op-ed for Guardian Australia, wherein she wrote about her legacy and how she believes the Labor Party ought to rebuild. In June 2015, Gillard participated in Sarah Ferguson's The Killing Season, a three-part documentary series which chronicles {{the events of the}} Rudd–Gillard years in power. The television series featured in-depth interviews with key Labor Party officials during the Rudd–Gillard Governments.

In an article for Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy, Middlebury College women's studies professor Deborah Grant compared the book to Harmful to Minors by Judith Levine. Grant characterized both books as significant works emphasizing the importance of allowing youths access to informative educational resources. She classed Heins' monograph as a thorough and important survey of the chronology of censorship. Perry L. Glanzer wrote in English Journal that Heins had a valid viewpoint to engage students on controversial topics in literature classes, and he added it was necessary to teach them all perspectives of a debate. Ellen P. Goodman wrote for Berkeley Technology Law Journal that Heins was critical of prior articles which attempted to show negative impact from violence as portrayed on television programs.|$|E

5|$|The anti-Hindi {{imposition}} agitations of 1937–40 and 1940–50 led to {{a change}} of guard in the Madras Presidency. The main opposition party to the Indian National Congress in the state, the Justice Party, came under Periyar's leadership on 29 December 1938. In 1944, the Justice Party was renamed as Dravidar Kazhagam. The political careers of many later leaders of the Dravidian Movement, such as C. N. Annadurai and M. Karunanidhi, started with their participation in these agitations. The agitations stopped the compulsory teaching of Hindi in the state. The agitations of the 1960s {{played a crucial role}} in the defeat of the Tamil Nadu Congress party in the 1967 elections and the continuing dominance of Dravidian parties in Tamil Nadu politics. Many political leaders of the DMK and ADMK, like P. Seenivasan, K. Kalimuthu, Durai Murugan, Tiruppur. S. Duraiswamy, Sedapatti Muthaiah, K. Raja Mohammad, M. Natarajan and L. Ganesan, owe their entry and advancement in politics to their stints as student leaders during the agitations, which also reshaped the Dravidian Movement and broadened its political base, when it shifted from its earlier pro-Tamil (and anti-Brahmin) stance to a more inclusive one, which was both anti-Hindi and pro-English. Finally, the current two-language <b>education</b> <b>policy</b> followed in Tamil Nadu is also a direct result of the agitations.|$|E
