5|$|Although {{the fishing}} {{industry}} thrived in Christchurch, {{the importance of the}} harbour declined as it became inaccessible to vessels of a large draught. The <b>harbour</b> <b>entrance</b> was particularly troublesome with constantly shifting sandbars. In 1665 Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon, bought the Lordship of the Manor of Christchurch. As part of his plans to improve trade in the town, he attempted to resolve the problems with the <b>harbour</b> <b>entrance</b> by cutting a new one through the sandspit at the foot of Hengistbury Head. However, upon completion the new entrance repeatedly silted up and in 1703 a large storm damaged a groyne which blocked the entrance entirely. Over the following 150 years alternative schemes were proposed but none were ever taken up.|$|E
5|$|Originally, Betelgeuse {{was to call}} at Sines, Portugal, {{to lighten}} the load of the ship, but poor weather {{conditions}} prevented the vessel from entering the harbour. Plans were further frustrated at Leixões, where a ship had run aground across the <b>harbour</b> <b>entrance,</b> preventing Betelgeuse from berthing there to discharge her cargo. Betelgeuse was then instructed to sail for Whiddy Island, Ireland.|$|E
5|$|The Fishmarket Gate, {{built in}} 1381, stands eastward from the Great Arsenal. The three arches of the 15th century Small Arsenal, where small boats were repaired, are {{situated}} a bit further. The old tower of St. Luke's protects the harbour in the east, and the <b>harbour</b> <b>entrance</b> is encircled and guarded by the Revelin Fortress.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, it {{has been}} {{asserted}} that when Koombana left Port Hedland, she was unballasted, {{so that she could}} cross the sandbar at the <b>harbours</b> <b>entrance.</b>|$|R
50|$|The harbour is crossed at its narrowest {{point by}} the Auckland Harbour Bridge. To {{the east of}} the bridge's {{southern}} end lie the marinas of Westhaven and the suburbs of Freemans Bay and the Viaduct Basin. Further east from these, and close to the <b>harbour's</b> <b>entrance,</b> lies the Port of Auckland.|$|R

5|$|Despite this {{discovery}} Ritchie resolved {{to continue as}} ordered. He took the precaution of sending Helmuth to the <b>harbour</b> <b>entrance</b> to cover the withdrawal, and gathered together several small boats moored in the harbour. These he secured around his launch, providing added buoyancy in case it received fatal damage in the engagement he was sure would ensue. With preparations complete, one of Ritchie's boats (from the cruiser HMS Fox) moved to the <b>harbour</b> <b>entrance.</b> There it was met with a hail of fire from the shore, where the hidden German crews and town garrison had lain in wait. The Helmuth was also attacked, but despite sustaining severe damage both craft were able to limp to safety, carrying several wounded. From outside the harbour Fox and Goliath responded with a heavy barrage, demolishing several streets in the town, including the Governor's Palace. Ritchie, aboard the only remaining British boat in the harbour, attempted to pick up one of his officers who had earlier gone aboard the German hospital ship SS Tabora to conduct a medical inspection. This effort was unsuccessful, and on leaving the harbour Ritchie's launch came under sustained fire from machine guns, rifles and light artillery.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} months small {{passenger}} ferries travel between Tuckton and Mudeford Spit via the town quay. Another ferry crosses the Stour between Wick and the Quay just below Tuckton Bridge. This ferry was running before the bridge was built in 1882 and was then, the only crossing below Iford. Another ferry service operates across the <b>harbour</b> <b>entrance</b> from Mudeford Sandbank to Mudeford Quay. This ferry was operated by rowing boats until the 1960s; payment being {{at the discretion of}} the passenger.|$|E
5|$|Bayard's Cove Fort, {{also known}} {{historically}} as Berescove or Bearscore Castle, is an English 16th-century artillery blockhouse, built {{to defend the}} <b>harbour</b> <b>entrance</b> at Dartmouth in Devon. Constructed {{in the early part}} of the century, it had eleven gunports for heavy artillery and was intended to engage enemy vessels that broke past the external defences of the Dartmouth and Kingswear castles. It remained armed during the English Civil War, but was neglected in the 18th century and used for storage. The fort was restored in the late 19th century and is now managed by English Heritage and open to visitors.|$|E
50|$|However, almost {{immediately}} afterwards {{the decision was}} made to convert her to a loop layer, laying anti-submarine indicator loops across <b>harbour</b> <b>entrances,</b> her damaged boiler removed to provide storage for the cable and the 4-inch gun replaced with a pair of cranes. She remained in this role until paid off in April 1946 and laid up in reserve.|$|R
50|$|The <b>entrance</b> to the <b>harbour</b> can {{be quite}} dangerous, {{especially}} since Cook Strait to the south is notoriously rough. Close to the <b>harbour's</b> <b>entrance</b> lies Barrett Reef, its rocks breaking the water's surface at low tide. It was here in 1968 that the inter-island passenger ferry Wahine grounded during a storm, {{with the loss of}} 51 lives.|$|R
50|$|Swan Island now adjoins Sand Island, {{formed by}} the cutting of a channel between Port Phillip and Swan Bay to make the <b>entrance</b> to Queenscliff <b>Harbour.</b> The continual {{maintenance}} pumping of sand from the <b>harbour's</b> <b>entrance</b> channel to keep it navigable has resulted in longshore drift of sand north-eastwards to connect Sand Island with Swan Island and create two lagoons.|$|R
5|$|Eventually, Worsley found {{a command}} in the Merchant Navy, and, giving his age as 64 (he was {{actually}} 69), was appointed {{master of the}} Dalriada in August 1941. He worked to keep the <b>harbour</b> <b>entrance</b> at Sheerness clear of wrecked shipping and also carried out salvage work. His command was {{only for a few}} months for when the company that owned his vessel found out his true age, he was replaced. Unhappy at being put into the Merchant Navy Reserve Pool, he continued to advocate for a useful posting.|$|E
5|$|On 6 November, Thunderer {{was sold}} for scrap to Messrs, Hughes, Bolckow & Co. for £66,150. She was too deep in draught to enter their {{scrapyard}} in Blyth {{and so was}} partially stripped down at Rosyth. Even so, she grounded at the Blyth <b>harbour</b> <b>entrance</b> on 24 December. After she was refloated on 30 December, {{she went back to}} Rosyth to be further lightened, as her draught was still too deep to allow her to enter Blyth. She was towed from Rosyth on 12 April 1927 and reached Blyth two days later to finish demolition.|$|E
5|$|In August 1810, a {{squadron}} of four of Rowley's frigates, making {{up the majority of}} the forces under his command and led by Captain Samuel Pym, were despatched to Île de France to blockade Grand Port on the south-eastern coast. The arrival of a French squadron under Captain Guy-Victor Duperré on 20 August prompted Pym into ordering an inadequately planned attack on the harbour on 23 August and two of his vessels were wrecked on the reefs that protected the <b>harbour</b> <b>entrance.</b> Pym was unable to withdraw his remaining ships and the entire squadron was lost, leaving Rowley with only his flagship HMS Boadicea and two small brigs to conduct his campaign against six large French frigates. Urgent reinforcements were requested, as French ships under Captain Pierre Bouvet blockaded Île Bourbon.|$|E
50|$|The {{township}} of Cowell lies on Franklin Harbour, {{a naturally}} a land-locked bay {{with a narrow}} entrance through which the tide rushes in and out. This results in calm waters inside the harbour, {{with much of the}} bay being dominated by shallow tidal mud flats and associated mangrove ecosystems. Due to the velocity of the tide through the <b>harbour’s</b> <b>entrance,</b> the waters of the bay are constantly filled with clay and silt particles that are kept in suspension by the moving water. There are very few sandy beaches lining the harbour due to this fact. The Franklin Harbor Conservation Park is established on the southern arm of the <b>harbour</b> and <b>Entrance</b> Island.|$|R
50|$|The Japanese {{warships}} withdrew with Makarov in pursuit. With {{the arrival}} of enemy heavy units upon the scene, Makarov, now exceeding his gunfire support range from shore, turned about {{and headed back to}} Port Arthur; and the Japanese fleet did not pursue. As Petropavlovsk moved closer to the <b>harbour's</b> <b>entrance,</b> she detonated a Japanese mine. Secondary explosions followed quickly in succession and Petropavlovsk sank, taking Admiral Makarov with her.|$|R
25|$|On 1 June 1535, {{protected}} by a Genoese fleet, Charles V destroyed Barbarossa's fleet and, after a costly yet successful siege at La Goletta, captured Tunis. In the action, the Portuguese galleon Botafogo distinguished itself by breaking the chains protecting the <b>harbour's</b> <b>entrance</b> with its spur ram, thereafter opening fire on La Goletta. In the ruins, the Spanish found cannonballs with the French Fleur-de-lys mark, evidence of the contacts stemming from the Franco-Ottoman alliance.|$|R
5|$|On 9 October 1959 the Admiralty {{announced}} that Vanguard would be scrapped, {{as she was}} considered obsolete and too expensive to maintain. She was decommissioned on 7 June 1960 and sold to the Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain for £560,000. On 4 August 1960, when the ship {{was scheduled to be}} towed from Portsmouth to the breaker's yard at Faslane, Scotland, the whole of the Southsea sea front was packed with people who came to see her off. As Vanguard was being towed towards the <b>harbour</b> <b>entrance,</b> she slewed across the harbour and ran aground near the Still & West pub. She was pulled off by five tugboats an hour later, and made her final exit from Portsmouth. Five days later she arrived at Faslane, and by mid-1962 the demolition process was complete; she was the last British battleship to be scrapped.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} torpedoed during the Japanese {{surprise}} attack on Port Arthur {{during the night}} of 8/9 February 1904 and grounded in the <b>harbour</b> <b>entrance</b> when she attempted to take refuge inside, as her draft had significantly deepened from {{the amount of water}} she had taken aboard after the torpedo hit. She was refloated and repaired in time to join the rest of the 1st Pacific Squadron when they attempted to reach Vladivostok through the Japanese blockade on 10 August. The Japanese battle fleet engaged them again in the Battle of the Yellow Sea, forcing most of the Russian ships to return to Port Arthur after their squadron commander was killed and his flagship damaged. Retvizan was sunk by Japanese howitzers in December after the Japanese gained control of the heights around the harbour.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for the attack, Godsal and Lynes had carefully consulted available charts of Ostend following the previous operation's failure caused by German repositioning of navigation buoys. This careful study was, however, rendered worthless by a sudden fog which obliterated all sight of the shore. Steaming {{back and forth across}} the <b>harbour</b> <b>entrance</b> in the fog as the monitors and German shore batteries engaged in a long range artillery duel over the lost cruiser, Godsal looked for the piers marking the entrance to the canal. As he searched, two German torpedo boats sailed from Ostend to intercept the cruiser, but in the heavy fog they collided and, disabled, limped back to shore. During this period, Godsal's motor launches lost track of the cruiser in the murk, and it was not until the third pass that Vindictive found the entrance, accompanied by only one of the launches. Heading straight into the mouth of the canal, guided by a flare dropped by the launch, Vindictive became an instant target of the German batteries and was badly damaged, the shellfire exacerbating the damage suffered in the earlier Zeebrugge Raid and seriously damaging Vindictives port propeller.|$|E
50|$|Dartmouth Harbour (also Dart Harbour) is {{a natural}} port located in Dartmouth, Devon, England. It is {{situated}} {{at the mouth of}} the River Dart on the English Channel. Bayard's Cove Fort is a small fort, which was built to defend the <b>harbour's</b> <b>entrance.</b> The crafts which dock at the port are mainly local fishing vessels, naval ships and luxury yachts; warships routinely visit the harbour. The River Dart is navigable from Dartmouth to the old weir location at Totnes.|$|R
50|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II on 3 September 1939, Burnett was recalled to Australia where he was made assistant chief of naval staff at the Navy Office in Melbourne. By October 1940, he {{had been sent to}} Singapore as the senior RAN representative at an Allied conference considering the defence of the Asia-Pacific region. At the conference, he called for the establishment of the Naval Auxiliary Patrol, which proved successful at patrolling <b>harbour</b> <b>entrances</b> throughout the war.|$|R
5000|$|York Redoubt was a {{key element}} in the defence of Halifax Harbour in the 19th and 20th centuries, and saw many {{additions}} to its fortifications. It was a command centre for the local harbour defences in World War II, which included observation posts, a defensive minefield and a new gun battery below the fort at Sleepy Cove covering the anti-submarine net which stretched across the <b>harbour's</b> <b>entrance</b> from Fort McNab on McNabs Island. York Redoubt remained in military use until 1956.|$|R
5|$|Portsmouth hosted {{first-class}} cricket at the United Services Recreation Ground from 1882, while from 1895 to 2000 Hampshire County Cricket Club matches {{were played}} there. This arrangement {{came to an}} end in 2000 when Hampshire moved all their home matches to their newly built Rose Bowl cricket ground in West End. The city is also home to four hockey clubs: City of Portsmouth Hockey Club, who are based at the University's Langstone Campus; Portsmouth & Southsea Hockey Club, and Portsmouth Sharks Hockey Club, who are both based at the Admiral Lord Nelson School; and United Services Portsmouth Hockey Club, who are based on Burnaby Road. Great Salterns Golf Club, established in 1926, is an 18-hole parkland course with two holes playing across Saltern lake. There are also coastal courses at Hayling, near the entrance to Langstone Harbour in the east and at the Gosport and Stokes Bay Golf Club to the west of Portsmouth <b>Harbour</b> <b>entrance</b> in Gosport.|$|E
5|$|Realising {{that further}} {{manoeuvring}} would be pointless, Crutchley ordered the charges to be blown {{and the ship}} evacuated. As Engineer-Lieutenant William Bury prepared to detonate the scuttling charges, Crutchley took {{a survey of the}} ship and ordered all survivors to take to the boats on the seaward side of the wreck. As men scrambled down the ship's flank away from the shells and machine-gun bullets spitting from the <b>harbour</b> <b>entrance,</b> Crutchley made a final survey with an electric torch looking for wounded men among the dead on the decks. Satisfied that none alive remained aboard, he too leapt onto the deck of a motor launch bobbing below. The rescue mission itself, however, was not going as planned. Of the five motor launches attached to the expedition, only one had remained with the cruiser in the fog; ML254 commanded by Lieutenant Geoffrey Drummond. The launch—like the cruiser—was riddled with bullets; her commander was wounded and her executive officer dead. Despite her sheltered position behind the cruiser, fire from shore continued to enfilade the launch and a number of those aboard, including Lieutenant Bury, suffered broken ankles as they jumped onto the heaving deck.|$|E
5|$|Smuggling {{was one of}} Christchurch's {{most lucrative}} {{industries}} during the 18th and 19th centuries due to easy access to neighbouring towns and the difficult <b>harbour</b> <b>entrance</b> which acted {{as a barrier to}} customs cutters. Many townspeople were involved in this illegal trade and large quantities of wealth were accumulated. In 1784 a confrontation between a gang of local smugglers and Customs and Excise officers led to the Battle of Mudeford in which a Royal Navy officer was killed and a smuggler subsequently executed. Another important industry during this period was the manufacture of fusee chains for watches and clocks. In 1790, Robert Cox began to manufacture fusee chains in workshops in the High Street. By 1793 Cox gained a monopoly on chain production in Britain, supplying watch, clock and chronometer makers throughout the country. In 1845 William Hart opened a similar factory in Bargates. However, by 1875 the chains were no longer required due to changes in watch designs and the factories were closed.|$|E

50|$|Sherbrooke {{arrived at}} Halifax on 16 October 1812 as {{commander}} of the forces in the Atlantic provinces. The five years of Sherbrooke’s administration were dominated by war with the United States, which broke out in June 1812, and matters relating to the colony’s defence. He mounted guns at <b>harbour</b> <b>entrances</b> across the colony and placed the militias {{in a state of}} readiness. The war proved to be profitable for Nova Scotia. Sherbrooke’s commercial policies turned the Atlantic provinces into a thriving entrepôt for international trade.|$|R
5000|$|Two small {{scouting}} galleys {{entered the}} port, {{led by the}} small barge at a [...] "distance of a cross-bow shot." [...] The barge entered through the port's channel straight in the middle, with the other scouting ships remaining on guard {{at each of the}} points of the <b>harbour's</b> <b>entrance.</b> The barge approached the castle, and found all the Angevin galleys with their oars unshipped and beached. Counting twenty-two galleys and two smaller ships the Aragonese barge then returned to Lauria to report its findings.|$|R

50|$|On June 15 of 1428 the Hanseats came back, {{now under}} Lübeck command. Up to 40 ships {{especially}} loaded with stones and lime were sunk in the <b>harbour's</b> <b>entrance.</b> So the Royal Danish-Swedish fleet was trapped inside. This time the Hanseats used floating batteries, too. With {{the help of}} these floating batteries the Hanseats were able to extend the range of their artillery and to cover the Danish and Swedish ships with a massive bombardment.
