5|$|Hydrogen is {{sometimes}} placed above lithium, above carbon, above <b>fluorine,</b> above both lithium and <b>fluorine</b> (appearing twice), or left floating above {{the other elements}} and not assigned to any group in the periodic table.|$|E
5|$|Reactions of {{elemental}} <b>fluorine</b> with metals require varying conditions. Alkali metals cause {{explosions and}} alkaline earth metals display vigorous activity in bulk; to prevent passivation from {{the formation of}} metal fluoride layers, most other metals such as aluminium and iron must be powdered, and noble metals require pure <b>fluorine</b> gas at 300–450°C (575–850°F). Some solid nonmetals (sulfur, phosphorus) react vigorously in liquid air temperature <b>fluorine.</b> Hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide combine readily with <b>fluorine,</b> the latter sometimes explosively; sulfuric acid exhibits much less activity, requiring elevated temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the lighter}} elements, fluorine's {{abundance}} value of 400ppb (parts per billion) – 24th among {{elements in the}} universe – is exceptional: other elements from carbon to magnesium are twenty or more times as common. This is because stellar nucleosynthesis processes bypass <b>fluorine,</b> and any <b>fluorine</b> atoms otherwise created have high nuclear cross sections, allowing further fusion with hydrogen or helium to generate oxygen or neon respectively.|$|E
50|$|In a {{molecule}} that {{is composed of}} a central atoms and <b>fluorines</b> attached to it, the intermolecular bonding is not very strong. Moreover, the dense negative balls that <b>fluorines</b> are repel each other. Therefore, the intermolecular bonding strength falls further down, a result {{of which is the}} low melting point of high fluorides.|$|R
50|$|A tetrafluoride is a {{chemical}} compound with four <b>fluorines</b> in its formula.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} fluoroplastic is polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, DuPont brand Teflon), {{which is}} a simple linear chain polymer with the repeating structural unit:-CF2-. PTFE has a backbone of carbons single bonded in a long chain, with all side bonds to <b>fluorines.</b> It contains no hydrogens and {{can be thought of}} as the perfluoro analog of polyethylene (structural unit: -CH2-). PTFE has high chemical and thermal stability, as expected for a perfluorocarbon, much stronger than polyethylene. Its resistance to van der Waals forces makes PTFE the only known surface to which a gecko cannot stick. The compound, however, lacks an ability to transform upon melting, which is not a problem for various PTFE deratives, namely FEP (fluorinated ethylene propylene, with some <b>fluorines</b> replaced with the-CF3 group) or PFA (perfluoroalkoxy, some <b>fluorines</b> replaced with -OCF3). They share most properties with PTFE, but there are still differences, namely maximum usage temperature (highest for the non-flexible PTFE).|$|R
5|$|At least 17,000metrictons of <b>fluorine</b> are {{produced}} each year. It costs only $5–8 per kilogram as uranium or sulfur hexafluoride, but many times {{more as an}} element because of handling challenges. Most processes using free <b>fluorine</b> in large amounts employ in situ generation under vertical integration.|$|E
5|$|At room temperature, <b>fluorine</b> is a gas of {{diatomic}} molecules, {{pale yellow}} when pure (sometimes described as yellow-green). It has a characteristic pungent odor detectable at 20ppb. <b>Fluorine</b> condenses into {{a bright yellow}} liquid at −188°C (−306°F), a transition temperature {{similar to those of}} oxygen and nitrogen.|$|E
5|$|Chalcogens have diverse fluorides: {{unstable}} difluorides {{have been}} reported for oxygen (the only known compound with oxygen in an oxidation state of +2), sulfur, and selenium; tetrafluorides and hexafluorides exist for sulfur, selenium, and tellurium. The latter are stabilized by more <b>fluorine</b> atoms and lighter central atoms, so sulfur hexafluoride is especially inert. Chlorine, bromine, and iodine can each form mono-, tri-, and pentafluorides, but only iodine heptafluoride has been characterized among possible interhalogen heptafluorides. Many of them are powerful sources of <b>fluorine</b> atoms, and industrial applications using chlorine trifluoride require precautions similar to those using <b>fluorine.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{activity}} in Fine Chemistry deals with compounds libraries (Chirals, <b>Fluorines,</b> Building blocks for Combi-Chemistry) and flash chromatography. Interchim developed a unique flash chromatography system (PuriFlashEvo430 - integrated functions).|$|R
50|$|This {{reaction}} proceeds as {{a concerted}} 3+2 cycloaddition {{in the same}} mechanism as the Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition. Substituents other than <b>fluorines,</b> such as benzene rings, are also allowed on the cyclooctyne.|$|R
5000|$|The F2 {{molecule}} {{is commonly}} {{described as having}} exactly one bond (in other words, a bond order of 1) provided by one p electron per atom, as are other halogen X2 molecules. However, the heavier halogens' p electron orbitals partly mix with those of d orbitals, which results in an increased effective bond order; for example, chlorine has a bond order of 1.12. <b>Fluorine's</b> electrons cannot exhibit this d character {{since there are no}} such d orbitals close in energy to <b>fluorine's</b> valence orbitals. This also helps explain why bonding in F2 is weaker than in Cl2.|$|R
5|$|Chlorine is {{intermediate}} in reactivity between <b>fluorine</b> and bromine, {{and is one}} of {{the most}} reactive elements. Chlorine is a weaker oxidising agent than <b>fluorine</b> but a stronger one than bromine or iodine. This can be seen from the standard electrode potentials of the X2/X− couples (F, +2.866V; Cl, +1.395V; Br, +1.087V; I, +0.615V; At, approximately +0.3V). However, this trend is not shown in the bond energies because <b>fluorine</b> is singular due to its small size, low polarisability, and lack of low-lying d-orbitals available for bonding (which chlorine has). As another difference, chlorine has a significant chemistry in positive oxidation states while <b>fluorine</b> does not. Chlorination often leads to higher oxidation states than bromination or iodination but lower oxidation states to fluorination. Chlorine tends to react with compounds including M–M, M–H, or M–C bonds to form M–Cl bonds.|$|E
5|$|Elemental <b>fluorine</b> {{is highly}} toxic to living organisms. Its effects in humans start at {{concentrations}} lower than hydrogen cyanide's 50 ppm and {{are similar to}} those of chlorine: significant irritation of the eyes and respiratory system as well as liver and kidney damage occur above 25 ppm, which is the immediately dangerous to life and health value for <b>fluorine.</b> Eyes and noses are seriously damaged at 100 ppm, and inhalation of 1,000 ppm <b>fluorine</b> will cause death in minutes, compared to 270 ppm for hydrogen cyanide.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fluorine</b> is a {{chemical}} element with symbol F and atomic number 9. It is the lightest halogen and exists {{as a highly}} toxic pale yellow diatomic gas at standard conditions. As the most electronegative element, it is extremely reactive: almost all other elements, including some noble gases, form compounds with <b>fluorine.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The seesaw {{molecular}} geometry {{is found}} in sulfur tetrafluoride (SF4) with a central sulfur atom surrounded by four <b>fluorines</b> occupying two axial and two equatorial positions, {{as well as one}} equatorial lone pair, corresponding to an AX4E molecule in the AXE notation. A T-shaped molecular geometry {{is found in}} chlorine trifluoride (ClF3), an AX3E2 molecule with <b>fluorines</b> in two axial and one equatorial position, as well as two equatorial lone pairs. Finally, the triiodide ion (...) is also based upon a trigonal bipyramid, but the actual molecular geometry is linear with terminal iodines in the two axial positions only and the three equatorial positions filled with lone pairs of electrons (AX2E3).|$|R
50|$|Manganese tetrafluoride is an {{unstable}} solid that decomposes even at room temperature. Only {{one of the}} two allotropes, α-MnF4, is understood. In this compound, manganese forms -MnF6- octahedra which share bridging <b>fluorines</b> to make -Mn4F20- rings which are then further connected three dimensionally.|$|R
50|$|The tetrafluorides of iridium, platinum, palladium, and rhodium {{all share}} the same {{structure}} which was not known until 1975. They have octahedrally coordinated metal atoms with four of the <b>fluorines</b> shared and two unshared. The melting points, where known, are below 300 °C.|$|R
5|$|<b>Fluorine</b> is not {{essential}} for humans or other mammals; small amounts may be beneficial for bone strength, but {{this has not been}} definitively established. As there are many environmental sources of trace <b>fluorine,</b> the possibility of a <b>fluorine</b> deficiency could apply only to artificial diets. Natural organofluorines have been found in microorganisms and plants but not animals. The most common is fluoroacetate, which is used as a defense against herbivores by at least 40 plants in Africa, Australia and Brazil. Other examples include terminally fluorinated fatty acids, fluoroacetone, and 2-fluorocitrate. An enzyme that binds <b>fluorine</b> to carbon – adenosyl-fluoride synthase – was discovered in bacteria in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen, {{like some}} of the alkali metals, reacts explosively with <b>fluorine.</b> Carbon, as lamp black, reacts at room {{temperature}} to yield fluoromethane. Graphite combines with <b>fluorine</b> above 400°C (750°F) to produce non-stoichiometric carbon monofluoride; higher temperatures generate gaseous fluorocarbons, sometimes with explosions. Carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide react at or just above room temperature, whereas paraffins and other organic chemicals generate strong reactions: even fully substituted haloalkanes such as carbon tetrachloride, normally incombustible, may explode. Although nitrogen trifluoride is stable, nitrogen requires an electric discharge at elevated temperatures for reaction with <b>fluorine</b> to occur, due to the very strong triple bond in elemental nitrogen; ammonia may react explosively. Oxygen does not combine with <b>fluorine</b> under ambient conditions, but can be made to react using electric discharge at low temperatures and pressures; the products tend to disintegrate into their constituent elements when heated. Heavier halogens react readily with <b>fluorine</b> as does the noble gas radon; of the other noble gases, only xenon and krypton react, and only under special conditions.|$|E
5|$|Owing to {{the expense}} of {{refining}} pure <b>fluorine,</b> most commercial applications use <b>fluorine</b> compounds, with about half of mined fluorite used in steelmaking. The rest of the fluorite is converted into corrosive hydrogen fluoride en route to various organic fluorides, or into cryolite which {{plays a key role}} in aluminium refining. Organic fluorides have very high chemical and thermal stability; their major uses are as refrigerants, electrical insulation and cookware, the last as PTFE (Teflon). Pharmaceuticals such as atorvastatin and fluoxetine also contain <b>fluorine,</b> and the fluoride ion inhibits dental cavities, and so finds use in toothpaste and water fluoridation. Global fluorochemical sales amount to more than US$15 billion a year.|$|E
50|$|Trifluorides are {{compounds}} {{having three}} <b>fluorines</b> per formula unit. Many metals form trifluorides, such as iron, the rare-earth elements, and the metals in the aluminium and scandium columns of the periodic table. No trifluoride is soluble in water, but several are soluble in other solvents.|$|R
40|$|Reactions of a {{perfluorinated}} ligand, tetrafluorophthalic acid (o-H 2 BDC-F 4), with KNO 3 and M(OAc) 2 (M = Co, Mn) led to {{the formation}} of perfluorinated metal-organic frameworks [CoK 2 (o-BDC-F 4) 2 (MeOH) ]n (1) and [MnK 2 (o-BDC-F 4) 2 (DMF) ]n (2). The structures were characterized by elemental analyses, infrared spectra, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Both complexes show similar 2 -D heterometallic-organic frameworks containing unusual layered inorganic Kâ��Oâ��M connectivities. For 1 and 2, ortho <b>fluorines</b> of o-BDC-F 4 are bound to the K(I) ion, while the other <b>fluorines</b> participate in the linkage of adjacent coordination layers forming 3 -D supramolecular architectures via intermolecular FF interactions. Spectroscopic, thermal, and fluorescence properties have been investigated. Variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility studies indicate that 1 displays a weak antiferromagnetic effect between adjacent Co(II) ions...|$|R
50|$|Platinum tetrafluoride vapour at 298.15 K {{consists}} of individual molecules. The enthalpy of sublimation is 210 kJmol−1. Original analysis of powdered PtF4 suggested a tetrahedral molecular geometry, but later analysis by several methods identified it as octahedral, with {{four of the}} six <b>fluorines</b> on each platinum bridging to adjacent platinum centres.|$|R
5|$|Polymers {{exhibit the}} same {{stability}} increases afforded by <b>fluorine</b> substitution (for hydrogen) in discrete molecules; their melting points generally increase too. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), the simplest fluoropolymer and perfluoro analogue of polyethylene with structural unit , demonstrates this change as expected, but its very {{high melting point}} {{makes it difficult to}} mold. Various PTFE derivatives are less temperature-tolerant but easier to mold: fluorinated ethylene propylene replaces some <b>fluorine</b> atoms with trifluoromethyl groups, perfluoroalkoxy alkanes do the same with trifluoromethoxy groups, and Nafion contains perfluoroether side chains capped with sulfonic acid groups. Other fluoropolymers retain some hydrogen atoms; polyvinylidene fluoride has half the <b>fluorine</b> atoms of PTFE and polyvinyl fluoride has a quarter, but both behave much like perfluorinated polymers.|$|E
5|$|About 30% of agrichemicals contain <b>fluorine,</b> {{most of them}} {{herbicides}} and fungicides with a few crop regulators. <b>Fluorine</b> substitution, usually of {{a single}} atom or at most a trifluoromethyl group, is a robust modification with effects analogous to fluorinated pharmaceuticals: increased biological stay time, membrane crossing, and altering of molecular recognition. Trifluralin is a prominent example, with large-scale use in the U.S. as a weedkiller, {{but it is a}} suspected carcinogen and has been banned in many European countries. Sodium monofluoroacetate (1080) is a mammalian poison in which two acetic acid hydrogens are replaced with <b>fluorine</b> and sodium; it disrupts cell metabolism by replacing acetate in the citric acid cycle. First synthesized in the late 19th century, it was recognized as an insecticide in the early 20th, and was later deployed in its current use. New Zealand, the largest consumer of 1080, uses it to protect kiwis from the invasive Australian common brushtail possum. Europe and the U.S. have banned 1080.|$|E
5|$|All of the {{currently}} used volatile anesthetic agents are organofluorine compounds. Aside from {{the synthesis of}} Freon (Thomas Midgley, Jr. and Charles F. Kettering, 1928) and the discovery of Teflon (Roy J. Plunkett, 1938), the field of organofluorine chemistry had not attracted {{a great deal of}} attention up to 1940 because of the extreme reactivity of elemental <b>fluorine,</b> which had to be produced in situ for use in chemical reactions. The development of organofluorine chemistry was a spin-off from the Manhattan Project, during which elemental <b>fluorine</b> was produced on an industrial scale for the first time.|$|E
5000|$|As {{a result}} of its small size and high {{negative}} charge density, the fluoride anion is the [...] "hardest" [...] base (i.e., of low polarizability). Because of this, fluorides in real salt crystals often have higher effective charges than oxides of the same metal, even though oxygen's formal charge is twice as great as <b>fluorine's.</b>|$|R
40|$|Description of an {{experimental}} method for {{the determination of}} the longitudinal relaxation time for spin-decoupled protons by {{a modified version of the}} saturation recovery technique reported by Van Geet and Hume (1965). The described method should facilitate relaxation studies of chemically shifted protons (or <b>fluorines)</b> and can be applied to more complicated spin systems with the aid of triple resonance and noise-decoupling techniques...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAn {{ensemble}} of ten silicate clusters is examined using quantum chemical calculations (Density Functional Theory) {{as a potential}} model to study the effect of polymerization of the SiO 4 units on Raman intensities of silicates (crystalline and amorphous). Quite originally, instead of saturating non-bridging oxygen (NBO) with hydrogen atoms as generally {{found in the literature}} for similar approaches, NBOs, which hold a negative charge if not saturated, have been substituted by isoelectronic <b>fluorines</b> whose mass is corrected in normal mode calculations to be equal to that of an oxygen. By adjusting the number of <b>fluorines</b> per silicon, the different Qn coordination types characterizing the different classes of silicates are modeled. The relevance of this {{ensemble of}} clusters as a model to study the effect of polymerization on Raman intensities is established in several steps, the most important one being the qualitative reproduction of evolution of the Ip polymerization index with the number of bridging oxygen per silicon...|$|R
5|$|Chlorine is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Cl and atomic number 17. The second-lightest of the halogens, it appears between <b>fluorine</b> and bromine in {{the periodic table}} and its properties are mostly intermediate between them. Chlorine is a yellow-green gas at room temperature. It is an extremely reactive element and a strong oxidising agent: among the elements, it has the highest electron affinity and the third-highest electronegativity, behind only oxygen and <b>fluorine.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cuprous halides (with chlorine, bromine, and iodine) are known, as are cupric halides with <b>fluorine,</b> chlorine, and bromine. Attempts {{to prepare}} copper(II) iodide yield only cuprous iodide and iodine.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fluorine</b> has two solid forms, α- and β-fluorine. The latter {{crystallizes}} at −220°C (−364°F) and is {{transparent and}} soft, {{with the same}} disordered cubic structure of freshly crystallized solid oxygen, unlike the orthorhombic systems of other solid halogens. Further cooling to −228°C (−378°F) induces a phase transition into opaque and hard α-fluorine, which has a monoclinic structure with dense, angled layers of molecules. The transition from β- to α-fluorine is more exothermic than the condensation of <b>fluorine,</b> and can be violent.|$|E
40|$|An {{extensive}} {{study of}} disubstituted cycloalkanes like CnH 2 n where n= 3, 4, 5 and 6 using DFT((U) B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G(d) and 6 - 311 +G(2 df, 2 p)) calculations is presented {{focusing on the}} effect of pyramidalization of the radical center. A potential energy surface (PES) analysis shows that the radical prefers to pyramidalize anti to the two cis <b>fluorines</b> in the disubstituted cycloalkanes. The degree of pyramidalization for 1, 2 -difluorocyclopropyl radical is 43. 9 o away from the cis <b>fluorines</b> whereas for 1, 3 -difluorocyclobutyl radical, 1, 3 -difluorocyclopentyl radical and 1, 3 -difluorocyclohexyl radical is 3. 8 o, 5. 4 o and 14. 5 o respectively away from the cis <b>fluorines.</b> The importance of this pyramidality effect in these compounds is discussed in context with the carbon-hydrogen bond dissociation energies (BDE's) because the preference of the radical centers to pyramidalize anti to the <b>fluorines</b> affects the bond dissociation energy. Importance of steric effect and unfavorable electronic interactions have been extensively explored in planar permethylated cyclobutadiene (Me 4 CBD) and cyclooctatetraene (Me 8 COT) using ((U) B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G(d) and 6 - 311 +G(2 df, 2 p)) calculations. It is thought that steric interactions dominate electronic interactions in Me 8 COT, while this works opposite in case of Me 4 CBT. Instead, in Me 4 CBD the number of unfavorable electronic interactions between π bonds and out-of-plane hydrogens plays the dominant role in determining the relative energies. Interactions between the π bonds of CBD and the out-of-plane hydrogens on carbons attached to the four-membered ring becomes very interesting when the ring size changes. With ethano bridge on the cyclobutadiene ring interaction with the diagonal bonds results in non-bonding AOs across the other diagonal having the opposite phase in the highest occupied (HO) MO. If the HOMO and LUMO are switched, bis-ethano-bridged tetrahedrane is formed. It is suggested that bis-ethano-bridged tetrahedrane is thermodynamically more stable than bis-ethano-bridged cyclobutadienes. While the reverse is true for unsubstituted cyclobutadienes. The ability of ethano bridges to reverse the usual order is because it causes the doubly-bonded carbons to pyramidalize...|$|R
