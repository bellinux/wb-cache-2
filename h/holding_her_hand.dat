5|$|After {{graduate}} school Ahn moved to Seattle {{and worked as}} a psychotherapist. In late 2002 he was dismissed from his job as the supervisor of a group home for at-risk youth in Seattle, after one of the residents accused him of hugging her and <b>holding</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> In a 2013 retrospective he penned for news portal Rappler, Ahn contended that her allegations were false; made in retaliation for his sanctioning her with loss of privileges for illegal possession of a controlled substance.

5|$|Scully visits Kresge, {{wanting to}} look further into Roberta Sim's suicide, {{despite the fact}} that the police think it is a simple suicide. Scully finds a {{striking}} resemblance between the Sims' daughter, Emily, and her sister Melissa from when she was that age. Scully flashes back to a funeral she attended when she was a little girl but imagines Marshall Sim <b>holding</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> Scully insists on performing an autopsy on Roberta, thinking that she was murdered. Scully finds a needle puncture in Roberta's foot, causing her to believe that she was anesthetized and her suicide was staged. The police search the Sim's house and find a used hypodermic needle, which Marshall claims was used for injecting the anemic Emily with treatment. Scully spots the dark-suited men watching from a nearby car. Scully receives DNA data on Melissa, and matching it up to Emily's finds them nearly identical, causing her to believe that Emily is Melissa's daughter. Scully believes that Melissa gave birth to her while on the west coast and gave her up for adoption without ever telling the rest of the family. Scully flashes back to when she and Melissa were teenagers and were given cross necklaces from their mother for Christmas.|$|E
