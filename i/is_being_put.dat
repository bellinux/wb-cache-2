The tramway reopened on 4 April 2012 with Flexity 2 cars providing day to day services. Some of the traditional fleet has been retained and some of them have been restored, with unmodified trams being part of the 'Heritage Fleet' and modified, widened trams as part of the main fleet. The new depot at Starr Gate houses the Flexity 2 fleet. The Rigby Road depot, near Manchester Square, is where the traditional trams are kept.

25|$|Additional {{members of}} the Independent Constitutional Commission were also {{appointed}} to engage Somali constitutional lawyers, religious scholars and experts in Somali culture over the nation's upcoming new constitution, {{a key part of}} the government's Transitional Federal Tasks. In addition, high level federal delegations were dispatched to defuse clan-related tensions in several regions. According to the prime minister of Somalia, to improve transparency, Cabinet ministers fully disclosed their assets and signed a code of ethics. An Anti-Corruption Commission with the power to carry out formal investigations and to review government decisions and protocols was also established to more closely monitor all activities by public officials. Furthermore, unnecessary trips abroad by members of government were prohibited, and all travel by ministers required the Premier's consent. A budget outlining 2011's federal expenditures was also put before and approved by members of parliament, with the payment of civil service employees prioritized. In addition, a full audit of government property and vehicles <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>put</b> into place. On the war front, the new government and its AMISOM allies also managed to secure control of Mogadishu by August 2011. According to the African Union and Prime Minister Mohamed, with increasing troop strength the pace of territorial gains was also expected to greatly accelerate.|$|E

500|$|Windsor Castle {{occupies}} , and {{combines the}} features of a fortification, a palace, and a small town. The present-day castle was created during a sequence of phased building projects, culminating in the reconstruction work after a fire in 1992. It is in essence a Georgian and Victorian design based on a medieval structure, with Gothic features reinvented in a modern style. Since the 14th century, architecture at the castle has attempted to produce a contemporary reinterpretation of older fashions and traditions, repeatedly imitating outmoded or even antiquated styles. As a result, architect Sir William Whitfield has pointed to Windsor Castle's architecture as having [...] "a certain fictive quality", the Picturesque and Gothic design generating [...] "a sense that a theatrical performance <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>put</b> on here", despite late 20th century efforts to expose more of the older structures to increase the sense of authenticity. Although {{there has been some}} criticism, the castle's architecture and history lends it a [...] "place amongst the greatest European palaces".|$|E

500|$|A Hollywood executive, not {{involved}} with the film, felt it succeeded because it [...] "has a self-deprecating tone that’s riotous. It’s never been done before. It’s poking fun at Marvel.

[...] James Gunn, director of Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, refuted this and said Deadpool was a success because [...] "it’s original, it’s damn good ... and it wasn’t afraid to take risks". Gunn hoped studios would learn [...] "the right lesson" [...] from the film and not just try to make more films [...] "like Deadpool". After Fox's Logan (2017) also became a success, Forbes Paul Tassi reiterated Gunn's sentiments, saying the rating was [...] "appropriate given the 'adult' nature of these two heroes", but [...] "too much stock <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>put</b> into unrestrained violence rather than people examining what actually makes these movies work". Graeme McMillan at The Hollywood Reporter concurred, adding, [...] "Why not take the freedom that comes from that rating and try to re-approach the mainstream genre with that attitude?" ...|$|E
500|$|The team {{breaks into}} TweenLit Inc.'s headquarters, {{planning}} {{to replace the}} new novel with their old version before the mass printing begins. However, when they reach the printing room, the book publishing executive shows up {{with a group of}} armed men. He reveals that someone tipped him off about their plan, just as Lisa appears letting them know it was her because she wants her name on a book that will actually be popular. The executive types in the password in the printing machine and gives Lisa the honor of inserting the USB flash drive with the novel on it. Later, when the saddened members of the group-writing team are walking away from the headquarters, they pass a book store and discover that The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>put</b> on the stands. Lisa shows up again, letting them know that she only pretended to betray them so that the publisher would type in the password. When Lisa gave Bart a hug, she replaced the executive's flash drive with Bart's flash drive that contained the troll novel. As a result, she was able to put the original version into print. Lisa is happy to know that her name is finally on a book; however, when she opens a copy, she discovers that Gaiman is listed as the author, not her. It turns out that there were three flash drives and that Gaiman heisted his way to the best-seller list [...] "once again" [...] despite being illiterate. During the credits, it is revealed that Moe was aware of Gaiman's scheme, and was in fact allied with him from the start.

When companies join these social channels, consumers can interact with them directly. That interaction can be more personal to users than traditional methods of outbound marketing and advertising.

The Internet's ability to reach billions across the globe has given online word of mouth a powerful voice and far reach. The ability to rapidly change buying patterns and product or service acquisition and activity to a growing number of consumers is defined as an influence network.

[...] A June 2013 report by the Congressional Research Service estimated the program cost at $23 billion, or $400,000 per vehicle; military leaders contend the unit cost will be $250,000.
