5|$|Although the Australian/New Zealand {{study found}} that the F94L {{mutation}} was partially to significantly recessive in most traits, meaning cattle <b>heterozygous</b> for the mutation express less to significantly {{less than half of the}} effects noted for homozygous cattle, the Japanese {{study found that}} the meat and fat quantities in cattle <b>heterozygous</b> for the mutation were about midway between the two extremes.|$|E
5|$|Cattle <b>heterozygous</b> for the F94L myostatin {{mutation}} have a 50% {{probability of}} passing the mutation to their progeny. Because the mutation has greatest effect on carcase traits, only 50% of progeny of a <b>heterozygous</b> parent will inherit increased muscling {{associated with the}} mutation.|$|E
5|$|Of the 14 Limousins tested {{during the}} {{research}} {{that led to the}} discovery of the F94L variant, 12 cattle were homozygous for the variant and two were <b>heterozygous.</b> The second myostatin gene in both <b>heterozygous</b> cases were each different myostatin MH variants of types normally found in Belgian Blue and Charolais cattle.|$|E
5|$|According to a 2011 study, 13 out of 245 Labradors studied were <b>heterozygous</b> for the M264V {{mutation}} {{responsible for}} the melanistic mask, and one was homozygous. Within the breed, this trait is not visible.|$|E
5|$|The global {{prevalence}} of FH is approximately 10 million people. In most populations studied, <b>heterozygous</b> FH occurs in about 1:500 people, {{but not all}} develop symptoms. Homozygous FH occurs in about 1:1,000,000.|$|E
5|$|When {{one parent}} is <b>heterozygous</b> for the mutation, {{and the other}} {{homozygous}} for the mutation or the normal form of the myostatin gene, the expected average difference in rib eye area of progeny will be about 0.9in2 (12.3in2 x 7.5%), {{depending on whether the}} mutation or normal form of the gene is inherited from the <b>heterozygous</b> parent. In this case, the unpredictable variation in rib eye area represents about twice the possible change value for a 0% BIF accuracy.|$|E
5|$|About 1 in 300 to 500 {{people have}} {{mutations}} in the LDLR gene that encodes the LDL receptor protein, which normally removes LDL from the circulation, or apolipoprotein B (ApoB), {{which is the}} part of LDL that binds with the receptor; mutations in other genes are rare. People who have one abnormal copy (are <b>heterozygous)</b> of the LDLR gene may develop cardiovascular disease prematurely at the age of 30 to 40. Having two abnormal copies (being homozygous) may cause severe cardiovascular disease in childhood. <b>Heterozygous</b> FH is a common genetic disorder, inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, occurring in 1:500 people in most countries; homozygous FH is much rarer, occurring in 1 in a million births.|$|E
5|$|Alirocumab and evolocumab, both {{monoclonal}} antibodies against PCSK9, {{are specifically}} indicated as adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy {{for the treatment}} of adults with <b>heterozygous</b> familial hypercholesterolemia, who require additional lowering of LDL cholesterol.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possibility}} is that a gene for aposematism might be recessive and located on the X chromosome. If so, predators would learn to associate the colour with unpalatability from males with the trait, while <b>heterozygous</b> females carry the trait until it becomes common and predators understand the signal. Well-fed predators might also ignore aposematic morphs, preferring other prey species.|$|E
5|$|British {{test results}} of sale bulls in February 2010 {{indicated}} that of 142 animals tested, just under 90% were homozygous for the F94L mutation, about 8.5% were <b>heterozygous,</b> and 1.5% {{did not have}} the mutation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Heterozygous</b> FH is {{normally}} treated with statins, bile acid sequestrants, or other lipid lowering agents that lower cholesterol levels. New cases are generally offered genetic counseling. Homozygous FH often {{does not respond}} to medical therapy and may require other treatments, including LDL apheresis (removal of LDL in a method similar to dialysis) and occasionally liver transplantation.|$|E
5|$|Loss {{of hybrid}} vigour occurs and {{phenotype}} varies greatly in subsequent generations if F1 hybrids are inter-bred or backcrossed with animals genetically {{similar to the}} F1 parent. Inter-bred F1 hybrids will produce progeny that can be either <b>heterozygous</b> for each gene variant, homozygous for one gene variant, or homozygous for the other gene variant. When one of the variants has a large effect on a trait, for example the effect of myostatin variants on muscularity, larger phenotypic variation will occur among the progeny. Backcross progeny will have less phenotypic variation and comprise animals that are either <b>heterozygous</b> for each gene variant or homozygous for the variant found in the original F1 backcross parent.|$|E
5|$|Some {{forms of}} {{balancing}} selection do {{not result in}} fixation, but maintain an allele at intermediate frequencies in a population. This can occur in diploid species (with pairs of chromosomes) when <b>heterozygous</b> individuals (with just one copy of the allele) have a higher fitness than homozygous individuals (with two copies). This is called heterozygote advantage or over-dominance, of which the best-known example is the resistance to malaria in humans <b>heterozygous</b> for sickle-cell anaemia. Maintenance of allelic variation can also occur through disruptive or diversifying selection, which favours genotypes that depart from the average in either direction (that is, the opposite of over-dominance), and {{can result in a}} bimodal distribution of trait values. Finally, balancing selection can occur through frequency-dependent selection, where the fitness of one particular phenotype depends on the distribution of other phenotypes in the population. The principles of game theory have been applied to understand the fitness distributions in these situations, particularly in the study of kin selection and the evolution of reciprocal altruism.|$|E
5|$|The {{two major}} Limousin hybrids are Brahmousin (a cross between Brahman and Limousin cattle)) and Lim-Flex (a cross between Angus and Limousin cattle), which were both {{developed}} before {{the significance of}} the F94L myostatin variant had been quantified. When Limousins homozygous for the F94L myostatin mutation are used in crossbreeding, only one of the mutations will be inherited (that is, progeny will be <b>heterozygous</b> for the mutation), and a high level of phenotypic uniformity and hybrid vigour would be expected in the progeny. However, breeding using <b>heterozygous</b> animals as parents, which could include purebred Limousins of low percentage Full French content, and Lim-Flex and Brahmousin hybrids that have not been bred to a uniform (homozygous) standard over several generations, would produce progeny with inconsistent carcase characteristics and production value depending upon whether or not the F94L mutation was inherited.|$|E
5|$|Two coat color genes {{found in}} Morgans {{have also been}} linked to genetic disorders. One is the genetic ocular {{syndrome}} multiple congenital ocular anomalies (MCOA), originally called equine anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD). MCOA {{is characterized by the}} abnormal development of some ocular tissues, which causes compromised vision, although generally of a mild form; the disease is non-progressive. Genetic studies have shown that it is closely tied to the silver dapple gene. A small number of Morgans carry the silver dapple allele, which causes cysts but no apparent vision problems if <b>heterozygous,</b> but when homozygous can cause vision problems. There is also the possibility of lethal white syndrome, a fatal disease seen in foals who are homozygous for the frame overo gene. At present, there is one mare line in the Morgan breed that has produced healthy <b>heterozygous</b> frame overo individuals. The American Morgan Horse Association advocates genetic testing to identify carriers of these genetics, and advises owners to avoid breeding horses that are <b>heterozygous</b> for frame overo to each other.|$|E
5|$|Although {{atherosclerosis}} {{occurs to}} a certain degree in all people, people with FH may develop accelerated atherosclerosis due to the excess level of LDL. The degree of atherosclerosis approximately depends on the number of LDL receptors still expressed and the functionality of these receptors. In many <b>heterozygous</b> forms of FH, the receptor function is only mildly impaired, and LDL levels will remain relatively low. In the more serious homozygous forms, the receptor is not expressed at all.|$|E
5|$|Genes {{related to}} FLCN and {{diseases}} similar to BHD {{have been found}} in dogs, fruit flies, rats, and mice. In German Shepherd dogs, missense mutations in the canine ortholog of FLCN cause a similar phenotype to human BHDâ€”kidney cancers (in this case, mutifocal renal cystadenocarcinoma) and skin tumors (nodular dermatofibrosis). They had a similar pattern of tumorigenesis to human BHD in that the skin lesions were <b>heterozygous</b> for the FLCN mutation and the renal tumors were likely caused by loss of heterozygosity. Female German shepherds with a FLCN mutation are also prone to uterine leiomyomas.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} sickle cell trait on malaria {{immunity}} illustrates some evolutionary trade-offs {{that have occurred}} because of endemic malaria. Sickle cell trait causes {{a change in the}} hemoglobin molecule in the blood. Normally, red blood cells have a very flexible, biconcave shape that allows them to move through narrow capillaries; however, when the modified hemoglobinS molecules are exposed to low amounts of oxygen, or crowd together due to dehydration, they can stick together forming strands that cause the cell to sickle or distort into a curved shape. In these strands the molecule is not as effective in taking or releasing oxygen, and the cell is not flexible enough to circulate freely. In the early stages of malaria, the parasite can cause infected red cells to sickle, and so they are removed from circulation sooner. This reduces the frequency with which malaria parasites complete their life cycle in the cell. Individuals who are homozygous (with two copies of the abnormal hemoglobin beta allele) have sickle-cell anaemia, while those who are <b>heterozygous</b> (with one abnormal allele and one normal allele) experience resistance to malaria without severe anemia. Although the shorter life expectancy for those with the homozygous condition would tend to disfavor the trait's survival, the trait is preserved in malaria-prone regions because of the benefits provided by the <b>heterozygous</b> form.|$|E
5|$|Cholesterol {{levels may}} be {{determined}} {{as part of}} health screening for health insurance or occupational health, when the external physical signs such as xanthelasma, xanthoma, arcus are noticed, symptoms of cardiovascular disease develop, or a family member {{has been found to}} have FH. A pattern compatible with hyperlipoproteinemia type IIa on the Fredrickson classification is typically found: raised level of total cholesterol, markedly raised level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), normal level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and normal level of triglycerides. Total cholesterol levels of 350â€“550 mg/dL are typical of <b>heterozygous</b> FH while total cholesterol levels of 650â€“1000 mg/dL are typical of homozygous FH. The LDL is typically above the 75th percentile, that is, 75% of the healthy population would have a lower LDL level. Cholesterol levels can be drastically higher in people with FH who are also obese.|$|E
5|$|Females who {{participate}} in extra-pair fertilizations may incorporate better genes in their offspring than they could get with their social mate, but {{they are likely to}} receive less help with parental care from their social mates because of cheating. Extra-pair fertilization, therefore, can be costly to females as well. A possible theory why extra-pair fertilization occurs is that female organisms select males with overall high heterozygosity or dissimilar genetics from themselves. A microsatellite study suggests an alternative to heterozygosity selection. Because no correlation is found between female extra-pair fertilization frequencies and the overall heterozygosity of their social mates, it is suggested that females may choose only a selective set of <b>heterozygous</b> genes, particularly the MHC locus, which can affect the immunocompetence of offspring.|$|E
5|$|Inconsistent {{inheritance}} of myostatin mutations (for example, F94L in Limousins, nt821 in Angus, and Q204X in Charolais) by progeny {{is expected to}} result in possible BLUP prediction errors for EBVs and EPDs equalling or exceeding worst case standard errors of prediction. For example, average rib eye area for Limousins in US Meat Animal Research Center (USMARC) trials during the 1980s and early 1990s {{is reported to be}} 12.3in2, and the reported possible difference in rib eye area in progeny arising from {{inheritance of}} either two F94L mutations or two normal myostatin genes from <b>heterozygous</b> parents is estimated to be 1.8in2 (12.3in2 x 15%). This difference, which is unpredictable without DNA testing, is nearly four times the possible change value for a 0% BIF accuracy, reported to be 0.46in2 for the rib eye EPD.|$|E
5|$|Hybrids are {{offspring}} {{resulting from}} the breeding of two genetically distinct individuals, which usually {{will result in a}} high degree of heterozygosity, though hybrid and <b>heterozygous</b> are not synonymous. The deliberate or accidental hybridizing of two or more species of closely related animals through captive breeding is a human activity which has been in existence for millennia and has grown for economic purposes. Hybrids between different subspecies within a species (such as between the Bengal tiger and Siberian tiger) are known as intra-specific hybrids. Hybrids between different species within the same genus (such as between lions and tigers) are known as interspecific hybrids or crosses. Hybrids between different genera (such as between sheep and goats) are known as intergeneric hybrids. Natural hybrids will occur in hybrid zones, where two populations of species within the same genera or species living in the same or adjacent areas will interbreed with each other. Some hybrids have been recognized as species, such as the red wolf (though this is controversial).|$|E
5|$|Progeny of {{two parents}} of {{different}} breeds are termed F1 hybrids, F1 crosses or first crosses. F1 hybrids generally have an extremely uniform phenotype {{and benefit from}} hybrid vigour. These advantages are observed in the breeding {{of a wide variety}} of animals and plants, and arise because progeny inherit one of each paired gene from each parent. When both parents are homozygous for different variants of genes (known as alleles), which is likely to be the case when a breed has been developed and selected over several generations, progeny will inherit both gene variants present in the parents. The F1 hybrid progeny will then be <b>heterozygous</b> for each gene variant, which in turn increases the likelihood that the genes will code for an optimal protein or enzyme. This is the genetic basis of hybrid vigour. While many gene variants have effects that are of little consequence to beef production, a few, such as the myostatin variants found in different cattle breeds, have a major effect.|$|E
25|$|A <b>heterozygous</b> {{mutation}} is a mutation of {{only one}} allele.|$|E
25|$|People {{diagnosed}} with <b>heterozygous</b> (carrier) Î²-thalassemia have some protection against coronary heart disease.|$|E
25|$|Compound <b>heterozygous</b> {{mutations}} or {{a genetic}} compound {{consists of two}} different mutations in the paternal and maternal alleles.|$|E
25|$|Hemoglobin SC disease â€“ A {{compound}} <b>heterozygous</b> {{form with}} one sickle gene and another encoding Hemoglobin C.|$|E
25|$|<b>Heterozygous</b> {{mutations}} in the gene SH3TC2, associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth, confer susceptibility to neuropathy, including the carpal tunnel syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Parkinson's {{disease is}} {{recognized}} as being more common in Gaucher's disease patients and their <b>heterozygous</b> carrier relatives.|$|E
25|$|Sickle cell syndromes. A {{variety of}} sickle cell {{disorders}} result from inheritance of the sickle cell gene in a compound <b>heterozygous</b> manner with other mutant beta globin genes. These disorders include sickle cell-beta thalassemia. In {{the case of}} sickle cell anemia, an individual with one allele for hemoglobin S and one allele for hemoglobin C would still develop the disease, despite being <b>heterozygous</b> for both genes.|$|E
25|$|The cystic {{fibrosis}} genetic mutation known as delta-F508 in humans {{has been said}} to maintain a selective <b>heterozygous</b> advantage: <b>heterozygous</b> carriers of the mutation (who are thus not affected by {{cystic fibrosis}}) are more resistant to V. cholerae infections. In this model, the genetic deficiency in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator channel proteins interferes with bacteria binding to the intestinal epithelium, thus reducing the effects of an infection.|$|E
25|$|In the {{majority}} of the patients with multi-system PHA1B a homozygous mutation or two compound <b>heterozygous</b> mutations have been detected.|$|E
25|$|The only {{generally}} accepted breeding gives a 50% chance of producing <b>heterozygous</b> folds and 50% chance of producing normals.|$|E
25|$|While both <b>heterozygous</b> and {{homozygous}} Lp horses {{possess the}} aforementioned characteristics, heterozygotes and homozygotes differ {{significantly in the}} presence of true spots. True leopard spots are produced only by the Lp gene, and directly reflect the underlying coat color (bay, black, gray, cremello, red dun, and so on). Since these spots match the coat color, they are not visible unless the surrounding pigment is removed. As a rule, <b>heterozygous</b> leopards have larger, more abundant spots, while homozygotes have smaller, scarcer spots.|$|E
25|$|<b>Heterozygous</b> {{mutations}} in NRAS, HRAS, BRAF, SHOC2, MAP2K1, MAP2K2, and CBL {{have also been}} associated with a smaller percentage of NS and related phenotypes.|$|E
25|$|The gene NRG1 {{codes for}} neuregulin 1, a growth factor which {{is crucial to}} the {{development}} of the nervous system, and to neurotransmission and formation of synapses in adults. NRG1 and the gene for the receptor to which neuregulin 1 binds, ERBB4, have been tested as possible animal models of schizophrenia. While mice which have two copies of (are homozygous for) a knocked out version of NRG1 do not survive, viable animal models have been developed using <b>heterozygous</b> or partial knockout. One such mouse model is the <b>heterozygous</b> removal of the EGF-like domain on neuregulin 1, these models are called Nrg1(Î”EGF)+/âˆ’ mice. Nrg1(Î”EGF)+/âˆ’ mice have been shown to have social interaction problems, reduced prepulse of inhibition and larger spontaneous locomotion. Other neuregulin 1 models include the <b>heterozygous</b> removal of the transmembrane domain (Nrg1(Î”TM)+/âˆ’ mice) and the immunoglobulin domain (Nrg1(Î”Ig)+/âˆ’ mice). Nrg1(Î”TM)+/âˆ’ mice display hyperactivity in various conditions, an effect which is reduced by the atypical antipsychotic clozapine.|$|E
