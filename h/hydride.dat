5|$|One might {{believe that}} sodium or {{potassium}} <b>hydride</b> {{would be the}} ideal base for deprotonating these precursor salts. The <b>hydride</b> should react irreversibly {{with the loss of}} hydrogen to give the desired carbene, with the inorganic by-products and excess <b>hydride</b> being removed by filtration. In practice this reaction is often too slow, requiring the addition of DMSO or t-BuOH. These reagents generate soluble catalysts, which increase the rate of reaction of this heterogeneous system, via the generation of tert-butoxide or dimsyl anion. However, these catalysts have proved ineffective for the preparation of non-imidazolium adducts as they tend to act as nucleophiles towards the precursor salts and in so doing are destroyed. The presence of hydroxide ions as an impurity in the metal <b>hydride</b> could also destroy non-aromatic salts.|$|E

50|$|Second, {{the central}} metal can {{influence}} a reducing agent’s strength. Aluminum {{is larger than}} boron, so it bonds more weakly to <b>hydrides,</b> which are more free to attack; aluminum <b>hydrides</b> are therefore better reducers than borohydrides. A third factor, sterics, is what makes certain substituted <b>hydrides</b> (<b>hydrides</b> in which one or more <b>hydrides</b> are replaced by substituents) much weaker reducers than other metal hydrides: sodium triacetoxyborohydride (NaBH(OAc)3), for instance, {{can be used to}} selectively reduce aldehydes, and leave the less reactive ketones unreacted.|$|R

The Mg-alloys containing Ⅲa transition metals could absorb much more amounts of hydrogen than magnesium-itself and form <b>hydrides</b> of the metals in the matrix. 2. These <b>hydrides</b> were identified as ScH 2, YH 2, and HoH 2, respectively, and formed on the specific crystallographic planes in the magnesium matrix.

The Mg-Sc alloys were hardened by internal <b>hydriding,</b> while softening took place in the Mg-Y and Mg-Ho alloys by <b>hydriding.</b> This discrepancy might be attributed to the difference in compromise between the decrease of solid solution hardening and the increase of dispersion hardening by <b>hydriding.</b> However, because of dispersed stable <b>hydrides,</b> all the internally <b>hydrided</b> alloys were expected to have an appreciable strength at high temperatures. 4.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} be used for applications, the {{thermodynamic}} stability of a candidate hydrogen storage material should be suitable for hydrogen sorption at room conditions. By mixing different <b>hydrides,</b> it is possible to promote the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation processes. On the other hand, small changes in composition allow a tailoring of thermodynamic stability of <b>hydrides.</b> Knowledge of thermodynamic stability of <b>hydrides</b> is thus fundamental to study the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation processes and useful to rationalize synthesis reactions and to suggest possible alternative reaction routes. The purpose of this work is to develop a consistent thermodynamic database for hydrogen storage systems by the CALPHAD approach. Experimental data have been collected from the literature. When experimental measurements were scarce or completely lacking, estimations of the energy of formation of <b>hydrides</b> have been obtained by ab initio calculations performed with the CRYSTAL code. Several systems of interest for hydrogen storage have been investigated, including metallic <b>hydrides</b> (M-H) and complex <b>hydrides.</b> The effect on thermodynamic properties of fluorine-to-hydrogen substitution in some simple <b>hydrides</b> is also considered.
