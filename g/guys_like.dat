25|$|The {{franchise}} {{celebrated its}} 10th anniversary in the OHL in 2004–05. The {{race for the}} central division title was close the entire year. By {{the end of the}} season the difference between first and fourth place was only four points. The Colts finished second in the central division; three points behind leaders Mississauga IceDogs, and one point ahead of Brampton Battalion and Sudbury Wolves. Second year player Bryan Little continued to build upon the success of his rookie season, scoring 36 goals and 32 assists for a total of 68 points. Third year Colt Hunter Tremblay was not that far behind, scoring a total of 62 points. Filling out the Colts offence were the likes of Travis Fuller, Dan Speer, and B.J. Crombeen. Rookie defencemen Andrew Marshall, Nathan Martine, Todd Perry, and Nick Plastino, along with local brothers Andrew Hotham, and Scott Hotham would protect the Colts goal all season. Throughout the season, the Colts would make trades that brought in <b>guys</b> <b>like</b> high scoring overager Rob Hisey from the Erie Otters, young role players like Mike Roelofsen and Daniel Lombardi, and a proven goalie in Dan LaCosta. Heading into the playoffs the Colts would look to have plenty of promise for the present, as well as the future. In the playoffs that year the Colts lost a disappointing first round series to the eventual Memorial Cup semi-finalist Ottawa 67's.|$|E

Morrison's family roots descend from the Ulster Scots population that settled in Belfast.

His father had what was at the time one of the largest record collections in Ulster (acquired during his time in Detroit, Michigan, in the early 1950s) and the young Morrison grew up listening to artists such as Jelly Roll Morton, Ray Charles, Lead Belly, Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee, and Solomon Burke; of whom he later said, [...] "If it weren't for <b>guys</b> <b>like</b> Ray and Solomon, I wouldn't be where I am today.

500|$|Following the 1995–96 season, Ducks captain Randy Ladouceur retired, {{leaving the}} team's {{leadership}} position vacant. After {{serving as an}} alternate captain the previous year, Kariya {{was chosen as the}} third captain in team history, following Ladoceur and Troy Loney. At 21 years old, he was the youngest active captain in the NHL and remained so until defenceman Bryan McCabe became captain of the New York Islanders two years later. Also during the off-season, there was speculation that the Mighty Ducks would acquire Wayne Gretzky, whose contract had expired with the St. Louis Blues. Gretzky's agent had publicly declared that the All-Star centre had interest in joining the Ducks, particularly to play with Kariya and Selänne, though the team had not contacted him with an offer. Instead, the Ducks signed 36-year-old centre Jari Kurri from the New York Rangers.

John Barrowman was one of the final candidates for the role of Will, but was rejected because he [...] "wasn't gay enough". The part instead went to Eric McCormack, who revealed that taking the role was not difficult because he liked the concept of a gay show not being about the [...] "issues" [...] of being gay.

500|$|By 1935 Jack Mara had {{received}} a degree from Fordham Law School, passed the bar, and was, at age 27, the team's president. By that same year, 19‑year‑old Wellington had become the team's secretary, {{and he started to}} exert influence over personal decisions. Newman retired before the 1935 season rather than come back from a back injury suffered the previous year when the team refused to give him a raise. This left Strong as the team's top draw, and the Giants signed him to a contract which guaranteed him $4,000 but gave him a percentage of the draw that could make his salary reach a maximum of $6,000 depending on attendance. At midseason the team's attendance had increased by 15% from the previous year's record ticket sales. Although Strong was paid well that season, and took advantage of high ticket sales from games in which he was injured, many of the other team's players were not. [...] "I felt pretty damn good," [...] Strong later said about his salary, [...] "but <b>guys</b> <b>like</b> Hein, Morgan, and Burnett weren't making much more than a hundred dollars a game. The salaries the front office fed to the newspapers weren't exactly true. We had three All-Stars on the Giants making less money than most of the bench warmers on the Dodgers. Hein was the greatest player the Giants ever had, but he didn't start making $5,000 until after his 12th season." [...] Hein remarked that he felt he was well paid for the time however, [...] "I think at the time $150 [...] was probably the highest pay of any lineman in the league. It was pretty good money, even though it wouldn't sound that way now, but you could buy a loaf of bread for a nickel and get a full meal for thirty-five cents in the Automat back then.

500|$|Padres {{general manager}} Kevin Towers said Hoffman {{was the first}} one in and the last one out of the {{ballpark}} everyday. Hoffman adhered to a daily conditioning program. When pitcher Jeremy Fikac was promoted to the majors in 2001, Hoffman invited him to join him on his usual afternoon run. [...] "I remember sitting in the bullpen that night, and my legs were still trembling from the run", Fikac recalled. [...] "I'd run before, but not at that pace ... I was thinking, I hope they don't call on me because I can't feel my legs under me ... His work ethic is unbelievable." [...] Bochy said, [...] " [...] one of those <b>guys</b> <b>like</b> Tony Gwynn—they never feel like they've arrived. Tony never thought, 'Well, I'm hitting [...]360 ... ' He was never content. And Trevor's the same way. They just keep working and make sure that they've got goals they want to reach." [...] After every save opportunity, whether he converted it or blew it, Hoffman would sit in the dugout for up to five minutes after his teammates had cleared out. Whether it was the euphoria from success or the sting of failure, he would sit there and drain all the emotion out of himself, put the game behind him, and move on. Tracy Hoffman said, [...] "He's all about order. That's the foundation to what he does. You see it when he's on the field. He's always the same, win or lose. He doesn't smile, doesn't show any emotion." [...] Padres manager Bud Black marveled at Hoffman's regimen. [...] "The daily preparation for his job, that focus and dedication each day to prepare for the ninth inning ... It was incredible to see live", said Black. [...] "I played with George Brett, a Hall of Famer who was a great worker. But Trevor took it to a level and a commitment and Hall of Fame caliber." [...] After Hoffman resurrected his final season and recorded his 600th save, Macha said Hoffman's [...] "work ethic and perseverance paid off ... He had to grind it out to get there." ...|$|E
500|$|Nash is most {{noted for}} his playmaking, ball-handling skills and shooting. He {{led the league}} in assists for five years, {{averaging}} 11.5 assists per game in 2004–05, 10.5 in 2005–06, 11.6 in 2006–07, 11.0 in 2009–10 and 11.4 in 2010–11 and won the 2005 and 2010 NBA All-Star Skills Contests. As of the end of 2012–13 season, he had a 90.4% career free-throw shooting average (best in NBA history) and a 42.8% career three-point shooting average (eighth-best in league history), and ranked {{as one of the top}} 10 players in league history in total assists, assists per game, and three-point field goals made. In addition, he is ranked second (starting from 1986–87) in regular season point–assist double doubles. In the 2005–06 season, Nash became the fourth player in NBA history to shoot 50% or better from the field, 40% from three-point range (43.9), and 90% from the line, joining Larry Bird, Reggie Miller, and Mark Price in the 50–40–90 club. Nash would repeat this feat three more times in the 2007–08, 2008–09 and 2009–10 campaigns. Nash (four times) and Larry Bird (two times) are the only players to have accomplished this feat more than once. A two-time NBA MVP, Nash is only the second point guard (along with Magic Johnson) to win the MVP award multiple times and the third guard in NBA history to earn back-to-back MVPs (joining Johnson and Michael Jordan). Only ten other NBA players have won back-to-back MVP awards: Johnson, Jordan, Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Moses Malone, Larry Bird, Tim Duncan, LeBron James, and Stephen Curry. On 11 May 2006, ESPN.com rated Nash as the 9th-best point guard of all time, and in a survey by nba.com in 2007, Nash received 85% of the votes by the league's general managers as best point guard in the league. In a similar survey in 2009, Nash was rated as the best passer of the ball and the player possessing the best basketball IQ. Commenting on Nash losing out to former teammate Dirk Nowitzki for the 2007 NBA MVP, Boston Celtics centre and Hall of Famer Russell stated: [...] "I think, on the world stage, he's one of our great athletes in all sports...
