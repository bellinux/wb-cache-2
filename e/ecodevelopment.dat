This project aimed to strengthen biodiversity conservation by establishing critical links between conservation and community well-being. The objective of environmental review of the project in the seven PA sites was to review the success of enabling strategies and interventions under the project in effectively addressing biodiversity conservation and optimising benefits to local communities through measurable improvements. Strategic environmental assessment, along with other indicators of success that have been adopted worldwide for evaluating integrated conservation and development projects, was used for the environmental review of the project. The prioritisation of investments in activities under the project was found to be in accordance with the ecological profile and in conformity with the objectives of conservation in each PA. Although most of the activities identified under the project are beneficial and provide evidence of their positive impacts on biodiversity conservation, the project at large had pitfalls and success in varying proportions in different sites.

The sanctuary has also benefited by the formation of SHGs. The <b>Ecodevelopment</b> Committees (EDCs) and SHGs stand as a social fence along the fringes. The most remarkable thing is that the SHGs have formed a separate women's group for patrolling in the forest. This special group is called 'Vasantha Sena' (Green Force). A group of six to eight women patrol everyday from 11 am to 5 pm in the forest voluntarily, without claiming any form of remuneration.

In order to utilise tourism industry market, uncontrolled numbers of tourists and related haphazard infrastructural facilities in the vulnerable mountain regions pose serious environmental implications. The ecological pressures are threatening land, water and wild life resources through direct and indirect environmental impacts together with generation of solid and liquid wastes, so green tourism is emerging as an important task in order to develop new relationship between communities, government agencies and private sectors. The strategy focuses on ecological understanding, environmental protection and <b>ecodevelopment.</b> The major attributes of the green tourism include environmental conservation and education and distribution of income to local people based on strong partnership.

Seven to 15 years later,when the land is ready to be used again, the farmer returns not to unproductive forest but to a mature rattan garden. The rattan is then harvested for home use or for sale, and the forest is again cut and burned and made ready to host rice and other food crops.

40|$|The {{introduction}} {{of the idea of}} <b>ecodevelopment</b> by the World Conservation Strategy (IUCN, 1980) led to the Bruntland Commission’s (WCED, 1987) concept of sustainable development with its recognition of the interdependencies among environmental conservation, social responsibility and economic development. Now well accepted and advanced by many nations, the idea of sustainability champ ions the existence of ecological and social conditions necessary to support the increasing quality of human life through future generations. The objective of such stewardship should be to pass on to future generations a stock of natural resources no less in quantity and quality than that inherited by the present generation. In a tourism context this has a considerable validity because it calls into question the logic of unbridled tourism growth based on mass numbers without any concern for the impact on the environment, particularly in natural areas. As already noted in Chapter 1, the advancement of wildlife tourism is underpinned by its sustainable base. Thus wildlife tourism, as a type of niche tourism, aims {{to meet the needs of}} present tourists and host regions while protecting and enhancing environmental, social and economic values for the future.

The methodology used in this study took into account an ecotoxicological analysis (to measure part of the objective components of the situation of risk), followed by a diagnosis of risk perceptions to guide the analysis of the social actors’ testimonies (stakeholders) involved in natural resource management: local residents, rural workers and government agents. The collected evidences suggest that local residents seem to be aware of, yet indifferent about the negative effects to human health – and other living creatures – arising from the dominant patterns of irrigated rice cultivation. However, the structural factors responsible for the reproduction of this type of agro-ecosystem remain either diffuse or invisible. This gap has been systematically reinforced both by the government agents at various scales of the coastal zone management system and by the means of mass communication. Among the rice farmers an attitude prevails that systematically minimizes the risks of intoxication, and the government agents tend to reproduce the same pattern of perception and reasoning as the entrepreneurs linked to the international system of production and dissemination of agro-chemicals. Facing these challenges, the authors suggest a more incisive application of the precautionary principle in the field of integrated and participative coastal zone management, in order to counteract the ideology of economic growth “at any cost” that violates the inalienable right of the local communities to live healthily in a healthy environment, and to follow the <b>ecodevelopment</b> path...|$|E
