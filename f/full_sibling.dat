40|$|Hematopoietic cell {{transplantation}} (HCT) remains the fundamental procedure to treat many diseases. Its success depends greatly {{on the degree}} of HLA matching between donor and recipient. Although the number of successful HCT procedures carried out worldwide increases every year, many patients remain unable to receive this treatment because of the difficulty of finding an HLA-matching donor. In our center, we identified the HLA types for all HCT candidates and their siblings in an attempt to determine the chance of finding a <b>full</b> HLA-matching <b>sibling.</b> Overall, 60 % of patients had a chance of finding an HLA-matching sibling. The chance of finding a matching sibling was 43 % in patients aged birth to 5 years, compared with 68 % in those aged 20 + years. In our Saudi population, patients in need of HCT have a greater chance of finding an HLA-matching sibling than is reported in most Western countries. This is mainly because of the larger number of siblings in most Saudi families. Younger children requiring HCT have a lesser chance of finding an HLA-matching sibling. Our data demonstrate that even in a country with relatively large families, it is still essential to consider alternative donor strategies, such as adult unrelated donors, unrelated umbilical cord blood units, and haploidentical donors...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Acute {{promyelocytic leukemia}} {{treatment}} revolutionized by new tretaMNETS. Currently number of patinets who undergoe {{hematopoietic stem cell}} transplantation decrased so experience with this modality is limited. Here we report our experience with stem cell transplantation in acute promyelocytic leukemia patients. Design and setting: retrospective, single center Methods: between year 2000 and 2011 we performed 20 HSCT in APL. Median age of patients was 25 year old. Patients received 3 autologous and 17 allogeneic HSCT from their HLA <b>full</b> match <b>sibling</b> donor. Different type of conditioning regimens applied for them. We used Cyclosporine and Methotraxtae as prophylaxis of GVHD after allogeneic HSCT. Results: Hematopoietic stem cell engraftment observed in all cases. Acute GVHD was mild to moderate in all except one and was manageable. one patient dies due to aGVHD. Chronic GVHD was extensive in 2 cases and one mortality observed due to sever cGVHD. Mortality rate was 35 % with a median follow up of 3. 5 years. Five patinets died due to their primary disease relapse after HSCT. Three years DFS and OS were 63. 1 and 77. 2 % respectively. Conclusion: hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is an acceptable consolidation for APL. Choosing between autologous or allogeneic transplantation, need facilities such as reliable method for molecular remission detection before HSCT and also close and reliable follow up of patients with clinical and molecular parameters...|$|R

Snow described the grape as a seedling that he created from crossing the Black Hamburg grape (an old synonym of Schiava Grossa) with the White Muscat of Alexandria.

40|$|Background: Severe {{acquired}} aplastic anemia (SAA) is {{an uncommon}} disease of childhood. Patients with SAA receive supportive care with transfusions and timely treatment of opportunistic infections, along with specific therapies, {{which may be}} allogenic stem cell transplantation (SCT) from a matched sibling or immunosupressive therapy (IT). Aim: To report the experience {{in the management of}} SAA. Patients and methods: Twenty five children with acquired SAA were treated from July 1992 to September 2005. Patients with <b>full</b> matched <b>sibling</b> donors received allogenic SCT after conditioning with a cyclophosphamide containing regimen. The other patients received immune suppression with cyclosporine plus methylprednisolone (n= 18) plus ATG (n= 17). All received supportive care until recovery of hematopoietic function. Those who had severe opportunistic infections at diagnosis or did not respond to two cycles of ATG were evaluated for unrelated donor SCT. Results: Seven patients received sibling donor SCT and 18 IT, which was repeated in six. Three patients received mismatched related (1) or unrelated (2) SCT. Nineteen patients survived with a median follow up time of 4 years, 14 with full hematologic recovery. Six patients died: four due to infections after IT or SCT, one due to intracranial hemorrhage and one with secondary myelodysplasia 12 years after IT. Conclusions: Most children with SAA can be treated successfully with sibling donor SCT or IT. Patients without a histocompatible sibling who fail to respond to IS have a worse prognosi...|$|R
40|$|Aims: To {{examine whether}} genetic {{influences}} {{on the development of}} alcohol use disorders (AUD) among men during emerging adulthood through mid-adulthood are stable or dynamic. Design: A twin study modeling developmental changes in the genetic and environmental influences on AUD during three age periods (18 - 25, 26 - 33 and 33 - 41) as a Cholesky decomposition. Setting: Sweden. Participants: Swedish male twin pairs (1532 monozygotic and 1940 dizygotic) and 66033 <b>full</b> male <b>sibling</b> pairs born less than 2 years apart. Measurements: AUD was identified based on Swedish medical and legal registries. Findings: The best-fitting model included additive genetic and unique environmental factors, with no evidence for shared environmental factors. Although the total heritability was stable over time, there were two major genetic factors contributing to AUD risk, one beginning at ages 18 - 25 with a modest decline in importance over time [0. 84; confidence interval (CI) = 0. 83 - 0. 88], and another of less impact beginning at ages 26 - 33 with a modest increase in importance by ages 33 - 41 (0. 31; CI = 0. 05 - 0. 47). Conclusions: The heritability of alcohol use disorders among Swedish men appears to be stable among three age periods: 18 - 25 years, 26 - 33 years, and 33 - 41 years. Two sets of genetic risk factors contribute to alcohol use disorders risk, with one originating during the ages 18 - 25 years and another coming online at 26 - 33 years, providing support for the developmentally dynamic hypothesis...|$|R
40|$|This {{pilot study}} explores {{the degree of}} {{solidarity}} felt between full and half siblings who are raised in a Mormon Fundamentalist polygamous community. The community under study is unique in that, {{at the level of}} official culture, it actively promotes <b>full</b> and half <b>sibling</b> solidarity through an ethos that strives to downplay genetic differences in favor of a harmonious family living together in one household. This community is an ideal cultural setting in which to examine the suitability of inclusive fitness theory for understanding the factors that promote family cohesion, sibling solidarity, and rivalry. Our main question becomes: is the degree of sibling solidarity a manifestation of genetic closeness or a natural byproduct of emotional closeness that arises from being raised together? We found evidence for more solidarity between full siblings than between half siblings. Our data suggest that, despite the force of religious ideals, and notwithstanding the continued close physical proximity of half siblings in the polygamous family, there is a pronounced clustering of feeling and affection in the polygamous family that is consistent with inclusive fitness theory...|$|R

40|$|International audienceBackground : Smoking during {{pregnancy}} {{has been shown}} to an increase the risks of several adverse birth outcomes. Associations with overweight and/or obesity in the offspring have also been suggested. We aim to investigate whether familial factors confound the association between maternal smoking {{during pregnancy}} and overweight in early adulthood in young Swedish males born 1983 - 1988. Methods: In a population-based Swedish cohort comprising 124 203 singleton males born to Nordic mothers between 1983 and 1988, we examined the association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and the risk of overweight in the offspring at around age 18 years. We also investigated the association within siblings, controlling for common genes and shared environment. Results: In the cohort analyses, the risk of overweight was increased in sons of smoking mothers compared to sons of non-smokers: adjusted odds ratios(OR) 1. 42, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 35 to 1. 49, and 1. 56, 95 % CI 1. 46 to 1. 66, for 1 - 9 cigarettes per day, and more than 10 cigarettes per day, respectively. Stratifying for maternal smoking habits across two subsequent male pregnancies, there was an increased risk of overweight for the second son only if the mother was smoking in both male pregnancies. The effect of smoking during pregnancy on the offspring's body mass index (BMI) was not present when the association was evaluated within <b>full</b> and half <b>sibling</b> pairs. Conclusion: The association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and offspring's risk of overweight appears to be confounded by familial factors...|$|R
40|$|Using Swedish {{nationwide}} registry data, {{the authors}} investigated {{the correlation of}} genetic and environmental risk factors in the etiology of drug abuse as ascertained from medical and criminal registries by modeling twin and sibling data. Medical drug abuse was defined using public inpatient and outpatient records, while criminal drug abuse was ascertained through legal records. Twin, <b>full</b> and half <b>sibling</b> pairs {{were obtained from the}} national twin and genealogical registers. Information about sibling pair residence within the same household was obtained from Statistics Sweden. Standard bivariate genetic structural equation modeling was applied to the population-based data on drug abuse ascertained through medical and crime registries, using OpenMx. Analyses of all possible pairs of twins (MZ: N = 4482; DZ: N = 9838 pairs), full- (N = 1, 278, 086) and half-siblings (paternal: N = 7767; maternal N = 70, 553) who grew up together suggested that factors explaining familial resemblance for drug abuse as defined through medical or criminal registries were mostly the same. Results showed substantial heritability and moderate contributions of shared environmental factors to drug abuse; both were higher in males versus females, and higher for drug abuse ascertained through criminal than medical records. Because of the low prevalence of both assessments of drug abuse, having access to population data was crucial to obtain stable estimates. Using objective registry data, the authors found that drug abuse—whether ascertained through medical versus criminal records—was highly heritable. Furthermore, shared environmental factors contributed significantly to the liability of drug abuse. Genetic and shared environmental risk factors for these two forms of drug abuse were highly correlated...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, I {{demonstrate}} how sociological {{data can be}} used to test predictions derived from evolutionary psychology, sensu lato. In the first section of the thesis, I test hypotheses from kin selection theory. Firstly, I test the hypothesis that relatedness influences adult sibling ties. Using a large scale dataset on family relationships from the Netherlands (NKPS), I show that both maternal and paternal half-siblings differ significantly from <b>full</b> siblings in <b>sibling</b> tie strength. In a follow up study, I also show that basic knowledge about a sibling, namely whether the sibling is still alive or not, varies according to sibling type. If siblings are not fully related {{they are less likely to}} have any basic knowledge about each other. Subsequently, I test the role of birth order for family relationships and specifically sibling ties. Kin selection theory suggests, that else being equal, firstborns will invest more in laterborn siblings, rather than vice versa. Using the same set (NKPS), I show support for this prediction. Unlike studies from undergraduate populations, however, I fail to find any evidence for a 'neglected middleborn' effect. Middleborns did not significantly differ from other birth orders in their sibling ties or their relationships with family members. The findings on birth order studies are discussed with reference to the current literature on kin competition, birth order and family dynamics. In the next part of the first section, I analyze how. childlessness influences family relationships. Kin selection theory suggests that childless individuals will be more inclined to invest in their siblings with children, than vice versa. I find support for this prediction in a sample of Belgian women and a sample from an historical American population. The findings of these studies are discussed with reference to the helpers-at-the-nest hypothesis. In the final two studies of this first section I test whether or not lineage affects of grandparental investment in kin. Using botha Dutch sample and a British sample, I show, that all else being equal, maternal grandparents, especially, maternal grandmothers, invest more in their grandchildren than paternal grandparents. The results are discussed with reference to current research on paternity uncertainty. In the second section of the thesis, I test predictions derived from the evolutionary psychology of mate choice, and life history theory. Firstly, I demonstrate the effect of a biological market on human mate choice using an historical sample. If there is an oversupply of men on the marriage market then women could demand higher status from their partner. This prediction from biological market theory was supported. In the following study, I test the hypothesis that female orgasm frequency is related to male quality using a sample of Chinese women. I find that male wealth, and to a lesser extent male height, predict female orgasm frequency. This is consistent with an adaptationist view of the female orgasm. In the final part of the second section, I present two studies testing hypotheses derived from life history. In the first study, I demonstrate that in a stressed environment, rural Guatemala, 'growing tall' is an accurate predictor of maternal fitness. In the second study, I evaluate the generalised Trivers-Willard Hypothesis which predicts that taller and bigger women will have relatively more sons than smaller and thinner women. I fail to find any support for this hypothesis in British and rural Guatemalan data. I conclude by briefly discussing why the use of a wide variety of secondary data resources covering modern societies is important for evolutionary psychology.
