2500|$|Cricket {{dominated}} Fowler's {{free time}} during his early years, {{and he played}} golf {{for the first time}} in 1879, aged 23 after a business trip to Bideford, Devon. A Royal Navy Captain took him to a course at Westward Ho!. He played the game with borrowed clubs, but after enjoying it he became a member of the club and continued to play.
