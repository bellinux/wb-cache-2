500|$|Musically, [...] "E.T." [...] is an {{electronic}} and hip hop song, and draws heavily from dubstep and techno, along with smaller amounts of drum and bass. BBC Music described the song as a [...] "rave-influenced quasi ballad". The song {{is written in}} the key of F minor and follows a slow tempo of 76 beats per minute in common time. Perry's vocal range spans from E♭4 to D♭5. Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times noted a [...] "hip-hop diva's stutter" [...] in the song {{similar to that of}} Rihanna. Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone found the song sounded similar to hard rock ballads by Evanescence. The song's production has been described as [...] "a mishmash and bleeps and blips with a <b>driving</b> <b>drum</b> track". Darryl Sterdan of the QMI Agency noted the song uses the [...] "stomp-stomp-clap" [...] beat from Queen's [...] "We Will Rock You" [...] (1977), while AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted similarities to productions helmed by Ryan Tedder.|$|E
2500|$|Journalist Alice Bolin {{writes that}} Pet Sounds [...] "repeated and perfected" [...] the themes and ideas {{introduced}} in the Beach Boys' album Today!, released one year earlier. Author Chris Smith wrote that the complex arrangements and more developed themes of Today! effectively foreshadowed the lush orchestration and maturity of Pet Sounds. Marshall Heiser expressed for The Journal on the Art of Record Production: [...] "Pet Sounds diverges from previous Beach Boys' efforts in several ways: its sound field has {{a greater sense of}} depth and 'warmth;' the songs employ even more inventive use of harmony and chord voicings; the prominent use of percussion is a key feature (as opposed to <b>driving</b> <b>drum</b> backbeats); whilst the orchestrations, at times, echo the quirkiness of 'exotica' bandleader Les Baxter, or the 'cool' of Burt Bacharach, more so than [...] Spector's teen fanfares." [...] Musicologist Daniel Harrison has written: [...] "In terms {{of the structure of the}} songs themselves, there is comparatively little advance from what Brian had already accomplished or shown himself capable of accomplishing. Most of the songs use unusual harmonic progressions and unexpected disruptions of hypermeter, both features that were met in 'Warmth of the Sun' and 'Don't Back Down.'" [...] Journalist Nick Kent felt [...] "Wouldn't It Be Nice" [...] to be [...] "teen angst dialogue" [...] that Wilson had already achieved with [...] "We'll Run Away" [...] the year before. However: [...] "This time Brian Wilson was out to eclipse these previous sonic soap operas, to transform the subject's sappy sentiments with a God-like grace so that the song would become a veritable pocket symphony." ...|$|E
50|$|In 2010, Sony Music {{released}} a remix {{version of the}} song in the album Viva Elvis, an album used for the Elvis show of Cirque De Soleil. The song has a reggae rock feel, and a <b>driving</b> <b>drum</b> rhythm.|$|E

After [...] "Puzzled But Dancing", he continued to write and record music, which was described by the Keyboard Magazine as [...] "assimilating the sometimes floating, sometimes <b>driving</b> <b>drums</b> of Indonesian music with catchy techno-pop hooks and winding post-minimalist patterns." [...] He resides in Singapore with his Indonesian journalist wife, Sari Sudarsono, and one daughter.|$|R
5000|$|... "Return of the Rat" [...] {{is a song}} by {{the punk}} rock band Wipers, and is the first track on Wipers' 1980 debut album Is This Real?.

50|$|The older chain boats on the Elbe, {{the chain}} steamers on the Neckar {{and the three}} craft on the Main {{belonging}} to the Hessian Mainkette company used a drum winch to transfer power. In order to ensure the necessary traction on the chain on the <b>driving</b> <b>drums,</b> the chain was wound several times around two traction drums placed one behind {{the other in the}} centre of the boat. The chain ran in four to five grooves and was alternately wound over the front and rear drums.|$|R
50|$|The band {{released}} three studio albums {{over their}} ten-year existence: {{one on the}} Dallas label Carpe Diem, one with Zoo Entertainment, and one with TVT Records. Additionally, they toured with industrial-metal groups such as Prong, Sister Machine Gun, Stabbing Westward, Young Gods, and many others. The band's first two albums established the group's sound: precise, <b>driving</b> <b>drums</b> overlaid with heavy industrial guitars and hard-edged vocals. However, the group refused to conform to any particular genre, incorporating elements of Eastern and Middle Eastern music, tabla drumming, and electronic music into their songs.|$|R
5000|$|By the 1970s, American {{influence}} from neighboring South Vietnam had reached Cambodia and Sothea, {{along with her}} contemporaries, began experimenting in Western genres. Her high, clear voice, coupled with the rock backing bands featuring prominent, distortion-laden lead guitars, pumping organ and loud, <b>driving</b> <b>drums,</b> made for an intense, sometimes haunting sound that is best described today as psychedelic or garage rock. Like {{the leader of the}} music scene, Sinn Sisamouth, Sothea would often take popular Western rock tunes, such as John Fogerty's [...] "Proud Mary" [...] and refashion them with Khmer lyrics.|$|R

50|$|In {{its best}} known incarnation, garage-rock protopunkers, The Sonics, covered the song on their 1965 album, Here Are The Sonics. Driven by haphazardly {{recorded}} fuzz guitar, a big <b>driving</b> <b>drum</b> sound, screaming vocals and a dirty saxophone break, it epitomized their sound at that time. The Sonics changed the chord progression {{from the original}} G-Am-Bb-Am, a 1-2m-m3-2m progression, to a basic 1-4-5-4 progression, which in G would be simply G-C-D-C. This is the version that virtually all other artists copied.|$|E
50|$|In 2013 Steele {{produced}} the Byron Bay band MT WARNING.

5000|$|... "It is a {{fragmented}} masterpiece, assembled with loving care and {{long hours in}} the studio. Brilliant in patches, but often taking far too long to make its various points, and curiously lacking in warmth or personal expression..."Ritual" [...] is a dance of celebration and brings the first enjoyable moments, where Alan's <b>driving</b> <b>drums</b> have something to grip on to and the lyrics of la la la speak volumes. But even this cannot last long and cohesion is lost once more to the gods of drab self indulgence." [...] —Melody Maker review of Tales from Topographic Oceans, 1973.|$|R
40|$|The <b>drum</b> <b>driving</b> {{system is}} one of the weakest parts of the long-wall shearer, and some methods are also needed to monitor and control the long-wall shearer to adapt to the {{important}} trend of unmanned operation in future mining systems. Therefore, it is essential to conduct an electromechanical dynamic analysis for the <b>drum</b> <b>driving</b> system of the long-wall shearer. First, a torsional dynamic model of planetary gears is proposed which is convenient to be connected to the electric motor model for electromechanical dynamic analysis. Next, an electromechanical dynamic model for the <b>drum</b> <b>driving</b> system is constructed including the electric motor, the gear transmission system, and the drum. Then, the electromechanical dynamic characteristics are simulated when the shock loads are acted on the <b>drum</b> <b>driving</b> system. Finally, some advices are proposed for improving the reliability, monitoring the operating state, and choosing the control signals of the long-wall shearer based on the simulation...|$|R

50|$|The {{song was}} written by Alan Shacklock and {{recorded}} {{along with the rest}} of the First Base album at Abbey Road Studios in the summer of 1972. Shacklock wrote the lyrics of the song as a retort to the 1960 John Wayne film The Alamo, which was full of historical inaccuracies and did not show the human side of the Mexican troops who defeated the Texian forces at the Battle of the Alamo. The song has a <b>driving</b> <b>drum</b> beat and funky bass and shows Shacklock’s fondness for African-American music and Wild West shoot outs.|$|E

According to a positive review by CMJ, [...] "As complex as Bleeding can get, the band is still basically a scroungy bunch that usually plays with scuzz-punk bands. The <b>driving</b> <b>drums</b> faithfully expose the blood and guts inside the goth body." [...] Also in 2005, the band released the live album Live on Sycophanticide.

5000|$|Desario's sound {{has evolved}} into {{sometimes}} dark indie rock, but always with a pop and melodic core. As a standard four-piece band, their songs are highlighted by <b>driving</b> <b>drums,</b> melodic bass lines and both rhythm and interestingly-picked guitar parts. Not always immediately obvious, the complex melodies are sometimes revealed after repeated listenings. Some of Desario's more recent influences include contemporary bands such as Interpol, The Walkmen, and Doves, as well as classic indie bands such as The Jesus and Mary Chain, Echo & the Bunnymen, The Stone Roses, and New Order. As if to acknowledge the band's sound's similarity to Scottish indie rock acts, SoundsXP wrote: [...] "Desario call Sacramento, California home, {{but if you were}} told they hailed from the somewhat less exotic city of Glasgow you probably wouldn't bat an eyelid.” ...|$|R
