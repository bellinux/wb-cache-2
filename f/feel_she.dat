When Beyoncé's creative team was widely searching for {{the concept of the}} song's music video, the singer sent a clip of a song called [...] "Roach Cock" [...] by Hanni El Khatib to Boots. Inspired by its <b>feel,</b> <b>she</b> requested from him to bring elements of that track to [...] "Jealous". He added a [...] "gnarly fuzz guitar ripping in the background" [...] to the song also present in its final version. Beyoncé explained the meaning of [...] "Jealous" [...] on her iTunes Radio channel, [...] " [...] a song about being human. We all get jealous. It doesn't matter who you are.

500|$|In 1959, Stafford {{was offered}} a {{contract}} to perform at Las Vegas, but declined it to concentrate on her family life. Because she disliked continuously traveling for television appearances that took her away from her children, and no longer found the music business fun, she went into semi-retirement in the mid-1960s. She retired fully in 1975. Except for the Jonathan and Darlene Edwards material, and re-recording [...] her favorite song [...] "Whispering Hope" [...] with her daughter Amy in 1978, Stafford did not perform again until 1990, at a ceremony honoring Frank Sinatra. The Westons devoted more time to Share Inc.a charity aiding people with developmental disabilitiesin {{which they had been}} active for many years. In or around 1983, Concord Records tried to persuade Stafford to change her mind and come out of retirement, but although an album was planned, she did not <b>feel</b> <b>she</b> would be satisfied with the finished product, and the project was shelved.|$|E
500|$|Ann Weldy (born September 15, 1932), {{better known}} by her pen name Ann Bannon, is an American author who, from 1957 to 1962, wrote six lesbian pulp fiction novels known as The Beebo Brinker Chronicles. The books' {{enduring}} popularity and impact on lesbian identity has earned her the title [...] "Queen of Lesbian Pulp Fiction". Bannon {{was a young}} housewife trying to address her own issues of sexuality when she was inspired to write her first novel. Her subsequent books featured four characters who reappeared throughout the series, including her eponymous heroine, Beebo Brinker, who came to embody the archetype of a butch lesbian. The majority of her characters mirrored people she knew, but their stories reflected a life she did not <b>feel</b> <b>she</b> was able to live. Despite her traditional upbringing and role in married life, her novels defied conventions for romance stories and depictions of lesbians by addressing complex homosexual relationships.|$|E
500|$|To {{create a}} [...] "throwback" [...] with {{elements}} of old-school genres combined with [...] "a modern-day twist", Aguilera sent letters to different producers that she hoped {{could help her}} with the direction she was taking for the project, encouraging them to experiment, re-invent and create a modern soul <b>feel.</b> <b>She</b> initially planned to condense the album into a single, more [...] "affordable" [...] disc, however she expanded Back to Basics as a double album. For the first disc, Aguilera collaborated with hip hop producers including DJ Premier, Rich Harrison, Kwamé, and Mark Ronson for the first time. Most songs from the first half incorporate horn samples to create [...] "gritty and old" [...] sounds. DJ Premier questioned if Aguilera was familiar with his work, though she had known of his jazz-influenced work with Gang Starr in late-1980s and early-1990s. In response, Aguilera wanted her album to draw inspirations from Premier's song [...] "Jazz Thing" [...] and noted that their collaboration became his first time [...] "venturing into the 'pop' world".|$|E

500|$|After Val and Eric foster Amy, {{she starts}} acting rebellious again. She starts {{drinking}} and throwing herself at men, forcing her foster parents to have second thoughts. Halfpenny told Inside Soap that Amy goes off the rails {{because she is}} convinced everything goes wrong in her life. [...] "She's afraid of getting hurt, so she spoils things for herself before anyone else can get there first." [...] Halfpenny explained that Val's parental approach compared to Eric's was contrasting. Eric had not been around when his son David Metcalfe (Matthew Wolfenden) grew up, Halfpenny said this factor meant that Eric is not tolerant with Amy's bad behaviour. Though, Val had brought up her own children, her approach towards Amy is [...] "light-hearted." [...] However, when Amy continues her alcohol binges, Val and Eric <b>feel</b> <b>she</b> has [...] "gone too far" [...] and [...] "question their {{ability to cope with}} her." [...] Served with an ultimatum, Amy has to endure changes to remain with her new family. Halfpenny claimed the main change she had to make was [...] "to keep her tongue in her own mouth and cool it down with the boys." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{releasing}} Stripped (2002) and {{collaborating with}} many different artists, Aguilera decided to record new old-school style materials for her upcoming album. She later {{explained that the}} lengthy break allowed her to write {{a lot about what}} she had experienced during that time. Aguilera also explained that she wanted to bring something novel to her album, which has 24 songs on it. She wanted to try to evolve as an artist and a visionary. As a result, Back to Basics, Aguilera's fifth studio album, is made up of two discs. On the first disc, she worked with [...] "more beat-driven" [...] producers, such as DJ Premier and Mark Ronson, who included samples in the production. The second one was written and produced solely by longtime producer Linda Perry. Aguilera sent letters to different producers that she hoped could help her with the direction she was taking for the project, encouraging them to experiment, re-invent and create a modern soul <b>feel.</b> <b>She</b> described the first disc as [...] "kind of a throwback with elements of jazz, blues and soul music combined with a modern-day twist, like hard-hitting beats".|$|E
500|$|Some {{suggest that}} Meyer is likely a Republican, while others <b>feel</b> <b>she</b> is a Democrat. Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times notes that Meyer's party {{affiliation}} is unknown because the show focuses on bullying and ego rather than ideology. James Poniewozik of Time explains the ambiguity as follows: Veep is [...] "almost all politics {{and almost no}} political issues". Robert Lloyd of Los Angeles Times explains the lack of need for party affiliations, or even political ideology in a similar manner, saying that Veep is [...] "less a show about politics than about politicking." [...] In an interview with The New Yorker Radio Hour, Julia Louis-Dreyfus suggested that Meyer's associated political party is intentionally left unknown to the audience. Louis-Dreyfus later elaborated: [...] " [...] politics are all about her and staying alive ... she will hold any position if it keeps her in office." [...] In the episode Election Night, CNN represents states won by Meyer as blue. In the same episode, she also comments winning the 'blue wall' states of Connecticut and Vermont with [...] "A bowl of hair could win those states".|$|E

500|$|In the film, Carey's {{character}} Billie Frank argues {{with her}} boyfriend and producer Dice (Max Beesley) and they break-up. Her emotional pain leads her to solo songwriting. Dice also misses Billie, and also begins writing a song. Billie goes to Dice's apartment {{in an attempt to}} reconcile. He was not home, but the music he has written is and Billie realizes they wrote the same song: [...] "Never Too Far". She kisses the sheet music, leaving a lipstick imprint, which Dice later discovers. Dice plans a reconciliation, but is killed by Billie's former producer Timothy Walker (Terrence Howard) after Dice did not pay the US$100,000 from their agreement to release Billie from Walker's contract. At Billie's first show at Madison Square Garden, her management and support crew see a report of the murder on television. They wonder if Billie was with him, they see that she is there and has seen the report.

500|$|After {{drifting}} {{with college}} friends {{through a few}} jobs for which she did not <b>feel</b> <b>she</b> was well-suited, Marjory Stoneman met Kenneth Douglas in 1914. She {{was so impressed with}} his manners and surprised at the attention he showed her that she married him within three months. He portrayed himself as a newspaper editor, and was 30years her senior, but the marriage quickly failed when it became apparent he was a con artist. The true extent of his duplicity Marjory did not entirely reveal, despite her honesty in all other manners. Marjory may have unwittingly married Douglas while he was already married to another woman. While he spent six months in jail for passing a bad check, she remained faithful to him. However, his scheme to scam her absent father out of money worked in Marjory's favor when it attracted Frank Stoneman's attention. Marjory's uncle persuaded her to move to Miami and for the marriage to end. In the fall of 1915, Marjory Stoneman Douglas left New England to be reunited with her father, whom she had not seen since her parents' separation when she was six years old. Shortly before that time, her father had remarried Lillius ("Lilla") Eleanor Shine, whose great-great grandfather was Thomas Jefferson. (Her grandfather was Francis W. Eppes.) Marjory later wrote that Lilla Shine [...] "remained my first and best friend all my life in Florida." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{characters}} and their stories {{served as an}} extension of the fantasy life Bannon developed as a child. They became her [...] "fantasy friends" [...] whose loves and lives she witnessed and through which she lived her own life vicariously, helping her through a difficult marriage, and a longing for a life she did not <b>feel</b> <b>she</b> was free to live. [...] "I realized very early that I should not marry, but I was going to make the best of a bad thing, and I was going to make it a good thing," [...] she remembered. Having no practical experience in a lesbian relationship while writing Odd Girl Out, she set out to gain what she termed [...] "fieldwork experience" [...] in her trips to Greenwich Village, and was successful enough to introduce those experiences into the next book in the series before relocating once more to Southern California. But she explained her fears about staying in Greenwich Village, saying I would sit there (in a gay bar) in the evenings thinking, 'What if (a police raid) happens tonight and I get hauled off to the slam with all these other women?' I had been extremely low profile, very proper, very Victorian wife. I know that sounds crazy in the 60s, but I was raised by my mother and grandmother, who really came out of that era, and talk about a rigid role-playing crowd! I couldn't imagine living through it. I just couldn't. I thought, 'Well, that would do it. I'd have to go jump off the Brooklyn Bridge.' As easy as it might be if you were a young woman in today's generation to think that was exaggerating, it wasn't. It was terrifying.|$|E
