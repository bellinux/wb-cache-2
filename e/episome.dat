5000|$|In eukaryotes, <b>episomes</b> used to mean non-integrated {{extrachromosomal}} closed circular DNA molecule {{that may}} be replicated in the nucleus. [...] Viruses {{are the most common}} examples of this, such as herpesviruses, adenoviruses, and polyomaviruses, but some are plasmids. Other examples include aberrant chromosomal fragments, such as double minute chromosomes, that can arise during artificial gene amplifications or in pathologic processes (e.g., cancer cell transformation). <b>Episomes</b> in eukaryotes behave similarly to plasmids in prokaryotes in that the DNA is stably maintained and replicated with the host cell. Cytoplasmic viral <b>episomes</b> (as in poxvirus infections) can also occur. Some <b>episomes,</b> such as herpesviruses, replicate in a rolling circle mechanism, similar to bacterial phage viruses. Others replicate through a bidirectional replication mechanism (Theta type plasmids). In either case, <b>episomes</b> remain physically separate from host cell chromosomes. Several cancer viruses, including Epstein-Barr virus and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, are maintained as latent, chromosomally distinct <b>episomes</b> in cancer cells, where the viruses express oncogenes that promote cancer cell proliferation. In cancers, these <b>episomes</b> passively replicate together with host chromosomes when the cell divides.

No recombinant <b>episomes</b> were detected using a recA− intermediate strain. If the intermediate strains harboring the F 101 <b>episomes</b> were purified, allowed to grow for 50 generations, and then mated with the recA− recipient, recombinant <b>episomes</b> were transferred at 8 % of the wild-type level for recB− and 13 % for recC−.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of ongoing gene therapy trials {{may be limited}} by the expression characteristics of viral and plasmid-based vectors. To enhance levels of heterologous gene expression, we have developed a safety-modified episomal expression vector that replicates extrachromosomally in human cells. This vector system employs a simian virus 40 (SV 40) large T antigen mutant (107 / 402 -T) that is deficient in binding to human tumor suppressor gene products, including p 53, retinoblastoma, and p 107, yet retains replication competence. These SV 40 -based <b>episomes</b> replicate to thousands of copies by 2 – 4 days after gene transfer in multiple types of human cell lines, with lower activity in hamster cells, and no detectable activity in dog, rat, and murine cell lines. Importantly, 107 / 402 -T has enhanced replication activity compared with wild-type T antigen; this finding may be due, in part, to the inability of p 53 and retinoblastoma to inactivate 107 / 402 -T function. We demonstrate that the level and duration of 107 / 402 -T expression regulates the observed episomal copy number per cell. Compared with standard plasmid constructs, <b>episomes</b> encoding 107 / 402 -T yield approximately 10 - to 100 -fold enhanced levels of gene expression in unselected populations of transient transfectants. To determine if 107 / 402 -T-based <b>episomes</b> replicate extrachromosomally in vivo, tumor explants in nude mice were directly injected with liposome/DNA complexes. Using a PCR-based assay, we demonstrate that SV 40 -based <b>episomes</b> replicate in human cells after direct in vivo gene transfer. These data suggest that safety-modified SV 40 -based <b>episomes</b> will be effective for cancer gene therapy because high level expression of therapeutic genes in transient transfectants should yield enhanced tumor elimination...|$|R

The frequency of transposition of a given marker can be as high as 10 - 4. The <b>episomes</b> which carry the transposed DNA always carry Mu as well. When this is coupled with the fact that induction or infection with Mu is necessary for transposition to occur, it is probable that both Mu enzymes and Mu DNA are required by the transposition process. <b>Episomes</b> selected for the presence of a given marker were analyzed for the presence of unselected markers. It was found that: (1) only markers linked to the selected marker can be cotransposed with it; (2) when two markers are simultaneously transposed, all markers lying between them on the chromosome are also transposed; (3) the frequency at which an unselected marker is cotransposed is in some way related to the distance between that marker and the selected marker; (4) the transposition process occurs in both Rec+ and Rec- strains.
