However, indirect injection engines require higher compression ratios, about 20:1, to compensate for the greater surface to volume ratio causing more heat loss from the cylinder charge.

50|$|The engine's high {{operating}} {{speeds and}} temperatures required a new jet fuel, JP-7. Its reluctance to be ignited required triethylborane (TEB) to be {{injected into the}} engine to ignite it and the afterburner. Above −5 °C, TEB spontaneously ignites in contact with air. Each engine carried a nitrogen-pressurized sealed tank with 600 cm3 (20.7 ounces) of TEB, sufficient for at least 16 starts, restarts, or afterburner lights; this number {{was one of the}} limiting factors of SR-71 endurance, as after each air refueling the afterburners had to be reignited. When the pilot moved the throttle from cut-off to idle position, fuel flowed into the engine, and shortly afterwards an approx. 50 cm3 (1.7 ounce) shot of TEB was injected into the combustion chamber, where it spontaneously ignited and lit the fuel with a green flash. In some conditions, however, the TEB flow was obstructed by coking deposits on the <b>injector</b> <b>nozzle,</b> hindering restart attempts. Refilling the TEB tank was a perilous task; the maintenance crew wore silver fire suits. Conversely, the JP-7 fueling was so safe that some aircraft maintenance was permitted during filling. The chemical ignition was chosen instead of a conventional igniter for reliability reasons, and to reduce mechanical complexity. The TEB tank is cooled with fuel flowing around it, and contains a disk that ruptures in case of overpressure, allowing TEB and nitrogen to discharge into the afterburner.|$|E

40|$|Effective fuel {{injector}} operation and efficient combustion {{are two of}} the most critical aspects when Diesel engine performance, efficiency and reliability are considered. Indeed, it is widely acknowledged that fuel injection equipment faults lead to increased fuel consumption, reduced power, greater levels of exhaust emissions and even unexpected engine failure. Previous investigations have identified {{fuel injector}} related acoustic emission activity as being caused by mechanisms such as fuel line pressure build-up; fuel flow through <b>injector</b> <b>nozzles,</b> <b>injector</b> needle opening and closing impacts and premixed combustion related pulses. Few of these investigations however, have attempted to categorise the close association and interrelation that exists between fuel injection equipment function and the acoustic emission generating mechanisms. Consequently, a significant amount of ambiguity remains in the interpretation and categorisation of injector related AE activity with respect to the functional characteristics of specific fuel injection equipment. The investigation presented addresses this ambiguity by detailing a study in which AE signals were recorded and analysed from two different Diesel engines employing the two commonly encountered yet fundamentally different types of fuel injection equipment.

These nozzles vary in design and performance depending on the application they are used in. Nevertheless, the primary objective for all atomizers is to disperse liquids in a controlled and uniformed manner while minimizing {{the amount of energy}} needed in the breakup process to achieve high quality atomization. Air-assist and air-blast atomizers are fuel <b>injector</b> <b>nozzles</b> commonly used in gas turbine engines in the aerospace, and power generation industries. The flow in these atomizers is considered to be two-phase flow since a portion of air taken from the compressor is also used to assist in the breakup of the fuel inside the combustion chamber.

The nozzles are investigated under varying gas to liquid ratios (GLR) where key spray parameters such as droplet diameter, velocity, volume flux, as well as spray angle are measured to characterize the nozzles using methods such as Shadowgraph, Optical Patternation, Phase Doppler Particle Analyzer (PDPA), and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The main {{function}} of a fuel <b>injector</b> <b>nozzle</b> is to break fuels into droplets, form the spray pattern, and propel the droplets into a combustion chamber. The amount of spray volume at a given operating pressure, the travel speed, and spacing between the jets of fuel can also {{be determined by the}} nozzle. In fuel injection, the smallest possible droplet size is desired for the most flow. This work presents an opportunity to use the Schlieren arrangement as a visualization method to view the flow of fuel from a three-hole fuel <b>injector</b> <b>nozzle</b> which cannot be seen by the naked eye. The jet flow of diesel Fuel was investigated by Schlieren photography.

The breakaway pressure of the nozzle was varied between 60 bar to 80 bar. Each hole of the nozzle is 0. 26 mm in diameter and 120 ° apart; the third jet could not be seen from the images because the camera took x-y dimension images.

This has included the implementation of high pressure common rail fuel systems employing high precision injectors with complex injection strategies, higher hydraulic efficiency injector nozzles {{and in some cases}} < 100 µm nozzle hole diameters. With the trend towards lower diameter diesel <b>injector</b> <b>nozzle</b> holes and reduced cleaning through cavitation with higher hydraulic efficiency nozzles, it is increasingly important to focus on understanding the mechanism of diesel <b>injector</b> <b>nozzle</b> deposit formation and growth.
