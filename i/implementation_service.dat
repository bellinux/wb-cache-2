Customers are able to debug and adjust designs, or to commission small-volume runs, without making major production investments. Fabrication costs are also shared by combining multiple designs from a single customer onto one [...] "mask set," [...] or wafer template. According to MOSIS, the service has delivered more than 60,000 integrated circuit designs.|$|E

50|$|An {{important}} milestone {{that followed}} was the Multi Project Chip (MPC) concept that allowed multiple designs to be fabricated {{on a single}} wafer, greatly reducing cost {{to the point that}} students' design exercises and prototypes could be fabbed in small numbers. The first successful run of an MPC line was demonstrated at Lynn Conway's 1978 VLSI design course at MIT. A few weeks after completion of their designs, the students had the fabricated prototypes in their hands, available for testing. Lynn Conway's improved new Xerox PARC MPC VLSI implementation system and service was operated successfully for a dozen universities by late 1979. It was then transferred to University of Southern California Information Sciences Institute, becoming the foundation for Metal Oxide Semiconductor <b>Implementation</b> <b>Service</b> (MOSIS), which has evolved since 1981 as a national infrastructure for fast-turnaround prototyping of VLSI chip designs by universities and researchers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Being one of {{the most}} {{promising}} current technologies, Web Services are at the crossing of distributed computing and loosely coupled systems. Although vendors provide multiple platforms for service <b>implementation,</b> <b>service</b> integrators, developers and providers demand approaches for managing service-oriented applications at all stages of development. In this sense, approaches such as Model-Driven Development (MDD) and Service Component Architecture (SCA) can be used jointly for modeling and integrating services regardless of the underlying platform technology. Besides, WS-Policy provides a standard description for extra-functional properties, which remains independent of both the final implementation and the binding to the service in question. In this paper we show a case study in which the aforementioned MDD, SCA and WS-Policy are assembled in order to develop web services and their extra-functional properties from a platform independent model, which is later transformed into platform specific ones and then into code. Keywords:Extra-functional property, Web service, model-driven development, aspect-oriented techniques, WS-policy...|$|E
