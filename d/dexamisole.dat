5000|$|An {{interesting}} adverse {{side effect}} these reviewers reported in passing was [...] "neurologic excitement". Later papers, from the Janssen group and others, indicate levamisole and its enantiomer, <b>dexamisole,</b> have some mood-elevating or antidepressant properties, although this {{was never a}} marketed use of the drug.|$|E
40|$|Clinical {{observations}} {{indicate that}} <b>dexamisole</b> and levamisole, the isomers of tetramisole, cause mood elevation. Their effects on smooth muscle cells and adrenergic nerves were investigated in strips of dogs' saphenous veins. <b>Dexamisole</b> (2. 5 X 10 - 6 to 4 X 10 - 5 M) augmented the contractile response to norepinephrine but depressed that to tyramine; cocaine inhibited the augmentation of the norepinephrine response. Levamisole (10 - 5 M) did {{not alter the}} response to norepinephrine, but augmented that to tyramine. At 1. 6 X 10 - 4 M <b>dexamisole,</b> more than levamisole, depressed the responses to norepinephrine, tyramine and acetylcholine. Activation by K+ ions was not affected by the isomers. Preparations, incubated with 3 H norepinephrine, were mounted for superfusion, tension recording and determination of 3 H norepinephrine and metabolites in the superfusate. <b>Dexamisole</b> and levamisole augmented the 3 H norepinephrine overflow during nerve stimulation; levamisole decreased the efflux of deaminated metabolites. During tyramine induced contractions, <b>dexamisole</b> depressed and levamisole augmented the efflux of 3 H norepinephrine; they reduced the appearance of metabolites. The increases in 3 H norepinephrine caused by the isomers during nerve stimulation were not seen after phenoxybenzamine. <b>Dexamisole,</b> more than levamisole, inhibited tissular uptake of 3 H norepinephrine. Levamisole, more than <b>dexamisole,</b> inhibited monoamine oxidase activity in vein homogenates. These interferences with release and disposition of norepinephrine {{may be related to}} the antidepressant properties of the tetramisole isomers. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Levamisole {{depresses}} {{the number}} of autologous rosette-forming cells (ARFC) in the spleen of nude (congenitally athymic) mice. Intravenous administration of 2. 5 mg/kg of levamisole produces maximal depression. This effect appears 15 h after injection and is transient, partially disappearing after 48 hr. <b>Dexamisole</b> is devoid of this depressing activity. Thymopoietin, a thymic hormone, is also shown to lower the level of autologous rosette formation. These results suggest a stereospecific interference of levamisole with the maturation of immature T-cell precursors in a manner resembling the action of thymic hormones...|$|E
