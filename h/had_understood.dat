5|$|In his office, Dumbledore {{explains}} that Snape <b>had</b> <b>understood</b> Harry's cryptic warning, and had subsequently contacted Sirius, learning {{that he was}} still at Grimmauld Place. After Harry failed to return from the Forbidden Forest, Snape deduced where he had gone and alerted the Order of the Phoenix, allowing them to save Harry and his friends. It is revealed that during the Christmas holidays, Kreacher had interpreted a command of Sirius's as an order to leave the house, and went to Narcissa Malfoy, the wife of Lucius, and told them about Harry and Sirius's close relationship; Voldemort subsequently realised that he could lure Harry to the Department of Mysteries by tricking him into thinking that Sirius was in danger there.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{negotiated}} a truce, {{under the terms}} of which the Malagasy undertook to spare the lives of the surviving crew members. In exchange it was agreed that Meermin would return to Madagascar, where the Malagasy would be released. But gambling on the Malagasy's ignorance of navigation, the wounded Muller instead ordered his crew to head for the coast of southern Africa. After making landfall at Struisbaai, in the Cape Colony, which the Malagasy were assured was their homeland, 50–70 of them went ashore. Their intention was to signal to the others still on board Meermin if it was safe for them to follow, but the shore party soon found themselves confronted by a militia of farmers formed in response to Meermins arrival; the farmers <b>had</b> <b>understood</b> that as the ship was flying no flags, it was in distress.|$|E

In Paris, the left wanted independence for Algeria. Although the military's near-coup had contributed to his return to power, de Gaulle soon ordered all officers to quit the rebellious Committees of Public Safety.

25|$|It took a {{full year}} for French's design to be {{transferred}} to the massive marble blocks. French provided finishing strokes in the carvers' studio in New York City and after the statue was assembled in the memorial on the National Mall in 1920. Lighting the statue was a particular problem. In creating the work, French <b>had</b> <b>understood</b> that a large skylight would provide direct, natural illumination from overhead, but this {{was not included in the}} final plans. The horizontal light from the east caused Lincoln's facial features to appear flattened—making him appear to stare blankly, rather than wear a dignified expression—and highlighted his shins. French considered this a disaster. In the end, an arrangement of electric lights was devised to correct this situation. The work was unveiled at the memorial's formal dedication on May 30, 1922.|$|E

Ward said, [...] "Every time Stan came up they chanted, 'Here comes the man!'" [...] "'That man,' you mean", Broeg said. [...] "No, the man", replied Ward.

[...] He <b>had</b> <b>understood</b> that the league needed a cooperative television contract with revenue-sharing, but he failed to overcome the obstacles to achieve it. He was portrayed by sportswriters as ensuring the owners treated the players fairly, and his decision to recognize the NFLPA in the face of adversity from owners was a [...] "master stroke" [...] in thwarting Congressional intervention. After he initiated terms for a pension plan with the players in 1959, little progress was made with the NFLPA, achieved another breakthrough when it persuaded the owners to provide a pension plan for the players."

500|$|On January 22, 2010, Savage {{revealed}} to his audience that {{a writer for}} Playboy had contacted him via email to do a lengthy interview, and again asked his listeners if he should accept the offer. During the show, Savage read from personal emails between the Playboy writer and himself. The writer admitted to being a listener of the Savage Nation but {{a critic of the}} profile done by The New Yorker. The writer also stated {{that the purpose of the}} interview was to [...] "rattle" [...] Playboys readers. On May 12, 2010, Savage revealed that he had granted the interview at his home. Playboy published the interview in June 2010. He read from a pre-publication copy of the 8,000-word Playboy interview, in which the writer expressed animosity for Savage and his views. Savage said that he was disappointed at the lack of journalistic objectivity, but did not harbor hatred for the writer. He referred back to the New Yorker interview by Kelefa Sanneh, and praised Sanneh as a [...] "real writer" [...] who <b>had</b> <b>understood</b> his subject.|$|E
500|$|Prior to Galileo's {{construction}} of {{his version of}} a telescope, Thomas Harriot, an English mathematician and explorer, had already used what he dubbed a [...] "perspective tube" [...] to observe the moon. Reporting his observations, Harriot noted only [...] "strange spottednesse" [...] in the waning of the crescent, but was ignorant to the cause. Galileo, {{due in part to}} his artistic training and the knowledge of chiaroscuro, <b>had</b> <b>understood</b> the patterns of light and shadow were, in fact, topographical markers. While not being the only one to observe the moon through a telescope, Galileo was the first to deduce the cause of the uneven waning as light occlusion from lunar mountains and craters. In his study, he also made topographical charts, estimating the heights of the mountains. The moon was not what was long thought to have been a translucent and perfect sphere, as Aristotle claimed, and hardly the first [...] "planet", an [...] "eternal pearl to magnificently ascend into the heavenly empyrian", as put forth by Dante.|$|E
500|$|In response, Duchesne gave what Nosanchuk writes was a [...] "well-reasoned argument", {{which the}} jury paid rapt {{attention}} to.

The defendant had given wildly conflicting stories to different doctors, Duchesne said, yet had convinced each one. Duchesne {{said that this was}} possible as Lamb was highly intelligent and able to project a false front if it suited him. The prosecutor then moved off the topic of Lamb's mental state and focussed on the matter of criminal responsibility in general. Five out of the eight psychiatrists in the court, the prosecutor said, had testified that Lamb <b>had</b> <b>understood</b> on an intellectual level that shooting Chaykoski and Woloch would kill them, which he asserted should be enough to incur criminal responsibility, even taking the psychiatric evidence into account. Finding Lamb {{not guilty by reason of}} insanity, he reasoned, would provide an inexpedient precedent in Canadian law and cause a spate of similar insanity defence attempts.|$|E
