5|$|After Kaycee's 'death', mourners who {{requested}} {{an address to}} send condolence gifts, cards, or <b>flowers</b> <b>to</b> were told that, despite previous acceptance of gifts by Kaycee, {{there was no longer}} a post-office box mailing address for her in Newton, Kansas. Debbie Swenson also informed Van der Woning when she told him of her death that there had already been a memorial service and Kaycee had been cremated.|$|E
5|$|B.s. var.spinulosa 'Honey Pots' is a {{form with}} all gold <b>flowers</b> <b>to</b> 20cm high (taller than forms listed above), however {{it is a little}} larger with reports of it growing to 1m high, with odd reports of it getting taller than this, by 1.2m across. It comes from south coast in Victoria, {{propagated}} by Rod Parsons of Carawah Nursery in Victoria.|$|E
5|$|Even in {{his early}} years, Linnæus {{seemed to have a}} liking for plants, flowers in particular. Whenever he was upset, he was given a flower, which {{immediately}} calmed him. Nils spent much time in his garden and often showed <b>flowers</b> <b>to</b> Linnaeus and told him their names. Soon Linnæus was given his own patch of earth where he could grow plants.|$|E
25|$|Pollen {{in plants}} {{is used for}} {{transferring}} haploid male genetic material from the anther of a single <b>flower</b> <b>to</b> the stigma of another in cross-pollination. In a case of self-pollination, this process takes place from the anther of a <b>flower</b> <b>to</b> the stigma of the same flower.|$|R

5000|$|Honey bees {{travel from}} <b>flower</b> <b>to</b> <b>flower,</b> {{collecting}} nectar (later converted to honey), and pollen grains. The bee collects the pollen by rubbing against the anthers. The pollen collects on the hind legs, in a structure {{referred to as}} a [...] "pollen basket". As the bee flies from <b>flower</b> <b>to</b> <b>flower,</b> some of the pollen grains are transferred onto the stigma of other flowers.|$|R
5|$|In {{the visual}} arts, {{narcissi}} are depicted {{in three different}} contexts, mythological (Narcissus, Persephone), floral art, or landscapes. The Narcissus story has been popular with painters and the youth is frequently depicted with <b>flowers</b> <b>to</b> indicate this association. The Persephone theme is also typified by Waterhouse in his Narcissus, the floral motif by van Scorel and the landscape by Van Gogh's Undergrowth.|$|E

5|$|Tech beat Auburn 41–0 on a muddy field. Substitute quarterback B. Adams {{returned}} a kickoff 80 {{yards for a}} touchdown. The other five touchdowns were achieved by plodding through the mud. The first was on a pass from Buck <b>Flowers</b> <b>to</b> Joe Guyon. Flowers ran in the second, and Guyon ran in the third. Wally Smith made one, and Red Barron the last.|$|E

50|$|Narada {{brings a}} parijatham, a flower that has {{everlasting}} fragrance, from Indra's tree to Krishna. Krishna is at Rukmini's {{house at the}} time, so he gives the <b>flower</b> <b>to</b> her. Satyabhama comes {{to know that he}} gave the <b>flower</b> <b>to</b> Rukmini, and becomes jealous. Krishna fights the devatas for the tree, and brings the tree back to Satyabhama.|$|R
5|$|The narrow bricks in {{the garden}} walls have been dated to around the 17th century. The walled garden would {{originally}} have been used predominantly for growing fruit, vegetables, and herbs for the household's consumption, as well as <b>flowers</b> <b>to</b> exhibit at shows and for pleasure.|$|E
5|$|Enquiries about insect {{pollination}} led in 1861 to novel studies of wild orchids, showing adaptation of their <b>flowers</b> <b>to</b> attract specific moths to each species and ensure cross fertilisation. In 1862 Fertilisation of Orchids gave his first detailed {{demonstration of the}} power of natural selection to explain complex ecological relationships, making testable predictions. As his health declined, he lay on his sickbed in a room filled with inventive experiments to trace the movements of climbing plants. Admiring visitors included Ernst Haeckel, a zealous proponent of Darwinismus incorporating Lamarckism and Goethe's idealism. Wallace remained supportive, though he increasingly turned to Spiritualism.|$|E
5|$|Some social wasps are omnivorous, {{feeding on}} fallen fruit, nectar, and carrion such as dead insects. Adult male wasps {{sometimes}} visit <b>flowers</b> <b>to</b> obtain nectar. Some wasps, such as Polistes fuscatus, commonly return to locations where they previously found prey to forage. In many social species, the larvae exude copious amounts of salivary secretions that are avidly {{consumed by the}} adults. These include both sugars and amino acids, and may provide essential protein-building nutrients that are otherwise unavailable to the adults (who cannot digest proteins).|$|E
5000|$|In 1801, 9 stuiver coins were issued, made by {{stamping}} [...] "9" [...] on Spanish colonial 1 real coins. In 1810, quarter cut 8 real coins were {{stamped with}} a five-petalled <b>flower</b> <b>to</b> produce 3 reaal coins. In 1815, fifth cut 8 real coins were also stamped with a five-petalled <b>flower</b> <b>to</b> produce smaller 3 reaal coins.|$|R

5|$|The game's {{four stages}} {{take place in}} power plants, flats, {{underwater}} habitats, and space stations in zero gravity, respectively. Every level is an interior space, and consists of multi-storey rooms and corridors divided by interlocking lifts and doors. The player {{is equipped with a}} jet pack to reach higher areas and perform acrobatic manoeuvres such as backflips and rolls. They can also swim and dive underwater. Robots attack the player with shooting flames should they come into contact. Each stage ends with a boss battle, ranging from fire-breathing <b>flowers</b> <b>to</b> robotic fish.|$|E
5|$|The {{method of}} Malaysian batik making is {{different}} from those of Indonesian Javanese batik, the pattern being larger and simpler with only occasional use of the canting to create intricate patterns. It relies heavily on brush painting to apply colours to fabrics. The colours also tend to be lighter and more vibrant than deep coloured Javanese batik. The most popular motifs are leaves and flowers. Malaysian batik often displays plants and <b>flowers</b> <b>to</b> avoid the interpretation of human and animal images as idolatry, in accordance with local Islamic doctrine. However, the butterfly theme is a common exception.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{ceremony}} afterwards with speeches from politicians from Alfonsín's tenure {{and from the}} Kirchner administration. The ceremony was aired in cadena nacional. It {{was followed by a}} mass given by José María Arancedo, archbishop of Santa Fe. Finally, a procession in the Callao Avenue with a military escort took the corpse to the La Recoleta Cemetery. People threw <b>flowers</b> <b>to</b> the coffin, fly Argentine and radical flags, and sung the national anthem. He was left in the pantheon for the veterans of the Revolution of the Park, until he got a special one for himself.|$|E

5|$|Birds roam {{from the}} forest floor to the canopy, but {{particularly}} favour the middle story. They mostly operate alone, in pairs or groups of three, and {{can also be found}} mixing with long-billed bernierias. Larger flocks do not occur. The nelicourvi weaver is an agile, active species that generally makes a lot of noise. It searches for insects on leaves, and branches, while hanging from vines and twigs. It looks for animals in rolled leaves such as wild ginger Aframomum and along leaf litter, probing crevices, and opening dead stems. It also dismembers <b>flowers</b> <b>to</b> reach the nectar. Mostly, arthropods (beetles, bugs, butterflies, caterpillars, dragonflies, flies, grasshoppers, leafhoppers, stick insects, millipedes and spiders) are consumed, sometimes small vertebrates (lizards and chameleons), next to some nectar, fruit and probably seeds.|$|E
5|$|Like their {{relatives}} the honeybees, bumblebees feed on nectar, using their long hairy tongues to lap up the liquid; the proboscis is folded under the head during flight. Bumblebees gather nectar {{to add to}} the stores in the nest, and pollen to feed their young. They forage using colour and spatial relationships to identify <b>flowers</b> <b>to</b> feed from. Some bumblebees rob nectar, making a hole near the base of a flower to access the nectar while avoiding pollen transfer. Bumblebees are important agricultural pollinators, so their decline in Europe, North America, and Asia is a cause for concern. The decline has been caused by habitat loss, the mechanisation of agriculture, and pesticides.|$|E
5|$|Six {{sets were}} {{constructed}} on which 60 pounds of baking soda {{were used as}} snow (the crew tried to use real snow but it melted), 42 pounds of glitter were used to cover the background, and 20 boxes of breakfast cereal were used to cover the coral rocks. Over 38 different types of foam were {{used to make the}} set pieces and the characters' bodies and heads. To render SpongeBob's pineapple house, palm fronds from a tree in a school yard were used. Other props and materials used were an actual starfish, three Christmas trees (for the Patchy the Pirate's Winter Wonderland scenes), six boxes of puff cereal (to create the fruitcake inside SpongeBob's mouth), 21 pounds of googly eyes (for rivets, texture pieces, knobs, etc.), 22 pounds of woodchips (to create Sandy's treedome floor), and 24 bunches of craft <b>flowers</b> (<b>to</b> create the parade float).|$|E

5|$|Some {{forms of}} mimicry {{do not fit}} easily within the {{classification}} given above. Floral mimicry is induced by the discomycete fungus Monilinia vaccinii-corymbosi. In this unusual case, a fungal plant pathogen infects leaves of blueberries, causing them to secrete sugars, in effect mimicking the nectar of <b>flowers.</b> <b>To</b> the naked eye the leaves do not look like flowers, yet they still attract pollinating insects like bees using an ultraviolet signal. This case is unusual, in that the fungus benefits from the deception {{but it is the}} leaves that act as mimics, being harmed in the process. It is similar to host-parasite mimicry, but the host does not receive the signal. It has a little in common with automimicry, but the plant does not benefit from the mimicry, and the action of the pathogen is required to produce it.|$|E
5|$|Speer's {{supporters}} {{maintained a}} continual call for his release. Among those who pledged support for Speer's sentence to be commuted were Charles de Gaulle, U.S. diplomat George Ball, former U.S. High Commissioner John J. McCloy, and former Nuremberg prosecutor Hartley Shawcross. Willy Brandt {{was a strong}} advocate of Speer's, supporting his release, sending <b>flowers</b> <b>to</b> his daughter {{on the day of}} his release, and putting an end to the de-Nazification proceedings against Speer, which could have caused his property to be confiscated. A reduced sentence required the consent of all four of the occupying powers, and the Soviets adamantly opposed any such proposal. Speer served his full sentence, and was released at midnight on October1, 1966.|$|E
5|$|The book {{describes}} how the relationship between insects and plants resulted in the beautiful and complex forms which natural theology attributed to a grand designer. By showing how practical adaptations develop from cumulative minor variations of parts of the <b>flowers</b> <b>to</b> suit new purposes, Darwin countered the prevailing view that beautiful organisms were the handiwork of a Creator. Darwin's painstaking observations, experiments, and detailed dissection of the flowers explained previously unknown features such as the puzzle of Catasetum, which had been thought to have three completely different species of flowers on the same plant. In addition, they produced testable predictions including his then-controversial proposal that the long nectary of Angraecum sesquipedale meant {{that there must be}} a moth with an equally long proboscis. This was confirmed in 1903 when Xanthopan morganii praedicta was found in Madagascar.|$|E
