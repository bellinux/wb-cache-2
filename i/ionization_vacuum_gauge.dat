The MWCNT emitter showed excellent emission characteristics under vacuum pressure below 10 - 6 Torr. The MWCNT source vacuum gauge presented good measurement linearity from 10 - 7 to 1 Torr for air.

40|$|The Diploma thesis {{concerns}} with problems of measurement pressure of vacuum systems, with pressure lower than 10 - 6 Pa. Although {{most of the}} basic constructions of vacuum gauge for these levels of pressure {{was developed in the}} beginning of 1960 s, the new constructions and modifications are still appearing. <b>Ionization</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>gauge</b> 3 BG (Bent Belt-Beam gauge) is one of them. Predisposition of 3 BG for measurement of pressure lower than 10 - 6 Pa is verified by means of experimental verifying of characteristics of the brand new construction of vacuum gauge 3 BG and by theoretical description of behaviour of the electrons in geometry 3 BG, using computer simulation. Experimental specification of the most favourable parameters for operation of vacuum gauge 3 BG is used for reaching maximal sensitivity with the cathode load at the lowest possible level.

30|$|The {{emission}} {{stability of}} a field emission electron source {{is one of the}} key factors that affect its potential application in vacuum electronic devices. The J-E curves can only show transitory field emission phenomenon in a short time and cannot reflect the field emission behavior sufficiently. Figure  5 d showed the looping testing of the CNTs. The anode voltage was increased or decreased by 30  V/step. Seen from loop testing with increased and decreased voltage between 1.5 and 3.5  V μm− 1 for 25 loops, there is no obvious deterioration of the maximum current density. Before the looping testing with maximum current of about 20  mA/cm 2, the current density of 10  mA/cm 2 was also tested with no deterioration. Figure  5 e displayed the typical J-E curves for different loops of the loop testing. The current density was relatively stable both in the increased and decreased voltage processes. During the increased or decreased voltage process of the field emission testing, desorption and adsorption of the gas molecules will change the work function of CNT and probably lead to a phenomenon of hysteresis [9, 44]. The hysteresis was unnoticeable in this work indicated that desorption and adsorption may reach an equilibrium state. Furthermore, the long-term test of the sample exhibited good stability for 50  h (Fig.  5 f). When <b>ionization</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>gauge</b> was opened, the emission current increased abruptly during the stability test as shown in the arrow pointed position of Fig.  5 f. The conditions in vacuum chamber and the surface state of CNT emitters may change in testing process which resulted in the rising of emission current. All these achievements underlined the potential of CNT emitters in applications.|$|E

30|$|Therefore, {{it is very}} {{important}} to monitor the vacuum level in a vacuum device in order to maintain satisfying field emission properties. To measure the inner vacuum of the device, the <b>vacuum</b> <b>gauge</b> should be integrated to the vacuum device without affecting the device.

40|$|Abstract. The hot-filament <b>vacuum</b> <b>gauge</b> is a {{traditional}} <b>gauge</b> for the <b>vacuum</b> measurement below 10 - 1 Pa. It consists of the cathode, grid and anode. The cathode is used to emit the electron to collide with a gaseous molecular to form a pair of ion and electron.

Unlike the traditional gauge with the large dimension, this paper develops a CMOS-compatible hot-filament <b>vacuum</b> <b>gauge.</b> With it, the <b>vacuum</b> <b>gauge</b> and its control circuit can be fabricated monolithically on a chip which will decrease the noise and be easy to use. Besides that, the optimal heating current for the cathode is also considered in this paper.

The fundamental aspects were probed for better understanding of the novel ionization processes. Initial applications were attempted to utilize the novel ionization methods for fast, robust, and quantitative analyses. For inlet ionizations (laserspray ionization inlet, LSII; matrix assisted ionization inlet, MAII; and solvent assisted ionization inlet, SAII), small (e. g. drugs) to large (e. g. proteins) non-volatile molecules are ionized with the assistance of heat and pressure drop, and are operated from AP. The ease of operation, rapidness of data acquisition, and simplicity of coupling with other techniques achieved by SAII, have enabled the inlet ionization for high throughput multiplexing analyses, hyphenation with liquid chromatography (especially at low flow rates), and fast surface assessment and drug quantifications. LSII has been utilized together with solvent-free sample preparation and solvent-free gas-phase separation for total solvent-free analysis.
