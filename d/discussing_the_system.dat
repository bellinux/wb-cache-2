He had studied the {{language}} assiduously {{for about two}} years previously, and so successfully that whilst we were at Dresden, he was enabled to dispense with a teacher and make his assistance little more than nominal. Occasionally he wrote a German exercise, but rather as an amusement than a discipline, and merely with the view of enlarging his German vocabulary. I remember his writing an elaborate description of Feniton Court, and imagining the place to be surrounded with trees belonging to all sorts of climates. The result was very amusing to ourselves, and added to the writer's stock of words on particular subjects. When our master Schier appeared, the conversation was led by a palpable ambuscade to the topic which had been made the subject of Patteson's exercise, and conversation helped to strengthen memory. After looking over a few of Patteson's German exercises, Mr. Schier found so little to correct, in the way of grammatical errors, that these studies were almost relinquished, and gave way to Arabic and Hebrew. Before we left Dresden, Patteson had read large portions of the Koran; and, with the aid of Hurwitz's Grammar and Bernhard's Guide to Hebrew Students, books familiar to Cambridge men, he was soon able to read the Psalms in the original. I remember the admiration and despair I felt in witnessing Patteson's progress, and the wonder expressed by his teacher in his pupil's gift of rapid acquirement. We had some excellent introductions; amongst others, to Dr. ----, a famous theologian, with whom Patteson was fond of <b>discussing</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> and organisation of the Church in Saxony. Up to the time of his leaving England he was constantly using Olshausen's Commentary on the New Testament, a book he was as thoroughly versed in as Archbishop Trench himself. I think that he consulted no other books in his study of the Gospels, but Olshausen and Bengel's Gnomon.|$|E

The Captain of the flight had been recently promoted and had received an F-28 rating. He had been planning to move to piloting the Fokker F-28. The first officer had already been promoted to the Fokker 28. Both members of the flight crew then began <b>discussing</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> of the F-28. This discussion was long and took {{the majority of the}} flight. Perhaps {{as a result of this}} banter, the flight crew failed to notice that ice had accumulated on the windshield of the aircraft. When the ice was eventually noticed, the flight crew activated the ice detection and anti-icing for the pitot static and the windshield of the aircraft.

This operative scenario requires a human-interaction framework that supports multimodal communication along with an effective and natural mixed-initiative interaction between the human and the robots.

30|$|Naturally, {{there is}} no single general purpose RE technique. As {{explained}} under RQ 2, our approach is best suited for particular contexts and should generally be used in conjunction with other existing methods. One of its limitations is that the number of needs elicited, prioritized and negotiated can overly depend on moderator’s abilities and motivation (Finding 1.2). As a result, in Study I, the prioritization results were insufficient (Finding 1.4). Therefore, special care should be taken when choosing and potentially training the moderator. For instance, when the Study III moderator was highly motivated, the results obtained were satisfactory for the participants questioned (Finding 3.2). Additionally, generating a snowball effect can be challenging (Findings 1.5 and 2.4).

40|$|This paper solves control {{problems}} of agents achieving consensus motions in presence of nonuniform time delays by obtaining the maximal tolerable delay value.

When <b>discussing</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> which is intended to achieve rotational consensus motion, an expanded system whose state variables are real numbers (those of the original system are complex numbers) is introduced, and corresponding consensus condition is given also in the form of delay margin.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} our {{innovation in}} game AI techniques, mainly game agents' modeling, planning and learning. The research topic involves {{the development of}} a game design software [...] - Gameme. Our work mainly focus {{on the development of the}} core AI module. In this thesis, after <b>discussing</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> design of Gameme, we explain our contributions in two parts: off-line design and real-time processing. In off-line design, we present goal-oriented behaviour design and related modeling methodology for game agents. The goal-oriented design provides not only an intuitive behaviour design methodology for non-professional game designers but also efficient support for real-time behaviour control. In particular, the goal-oriented design can be used in modeling agents in different games. The real-time processing component includes planning and learning mechanisms for game agents. These mechanisms are placed in a layered architecture. Basically, a procedural planning mechanism allows game agents to have the ability of fast reaction to their environment. Then, the creative transfer and adaptive learning mechanism trains game agents to learn from their experience and cooperate in teamwork. Furthermore, the unique emergent learning mechanism can allow game agents to have the ability to analyze different PCs' behaviour patterns and to find the suitable strategy to defeat PCs in real-time. Most of the experiments in this thesis are performed in fighting scenarios. We connected the core AI module with a 3 D graphics engine in order to have visual testing results. All test cases show that our goal-oriented behaviour design along with planning and learning mechanisms can provide fast, autonomous, collaborative and adaptive behaviour instructions for game agent in real-time game play...|$|E

How {{it is to}} be an {{adolescent}} among the Santals, in a world still shaped by tradition but where local knowledge has been pervaded by political awareness and modernity. ? The Santals, who number more than five millions, consider themselves as a «tribal» people speaking a different language (austro-asiatic) and sharing a way of life which implies values {{different from those of the}} Hindus. A central question, here, concerns the transmission of knowledge. In a tribal context, traditional knowledge is to a large extent endogenously determined. Differences in knowledge are no longer controlled by the elders, but still provide much of the momentum for social interaction. Since the colonial period schooling has been important but it has not succeeded to bring an equal opportunity of chances for all children. In brief, I will analyze how the traditional model of transmission is influenced by exogenous factors, such as schooling or politics, and events which allow children to emerge as new agents, developing a peer culture (W. Corsaro & D. Eder 1990). In the context of tribal India, where educational rights are granted by the Constitution, schooling often implies the dominance of Hindu culture on tribal children who feel stigmatized. <b>Discussing</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> of education, we shall se how teaching in the mother tongue or using a Santal script have been a crucial issue. The high percentage of dropout at the primary level shows that the system of education is not well adapted to tribal children who, however, are often pushed into the labour market to help their families. Consequently, other social factors such as religious movements or, migrations towards the town provide children and youth with new arenas to develop a peer culture which formerly was institutionalized in the village. We shall see that social mobility, as well as the emergence of a tribal elite, are exogenous factors which impinge on the structuration of a tribal peer culture. I shall finally examine how Santal youth participate to the reinvention of Tradition through village theatre and militant activities I argue that Santal youth peer culture develops its shared meaning towards two opposite directions: the assertion of ethnic identity and the development of a Santal literacy outside «official schooling» as well as the opening towards globalization through education, social mobility and elite formation...|$|E
