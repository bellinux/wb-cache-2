Torrential rains in Hainan caused significant flooding that killed 15 hikers and left several others missing. Numerous roads were also cut off or destroyed by landslides and 30 villages were inundated with flood waters. In Hong Kong, outer bands of Soudelor produced squally rain showers on July11.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{numerous}} studies have estimated the economic impacts {{of a variety of}} disruptions. Most of these studies are based on macroeconomic models that quantify the <b>direct</b> and indirect <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> from a disruption. <b>Direct</b> <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> occur due to damaged facilities or when consumers change their purchasing behavior because of the disruption.

Re/insurance catastrophe models made available to the researchers were used to (1) quantify flood risk (i.e., <b>direct</b> <b>economic</b> <b>losses)</b> caused by rainfall-driven riverine flooding in residential areas, and (2) determine how the information generated can be used to inform Canadian public policy {{in the face of a}} changing climate.

This paper uses scenarios of <b>direct</b> <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> to introduce the sectors' losses caused by the 2008  Wenchuan earthquake (2008  WCE) in Beijing, utilizing the Adaptive Regional Input–Output (ARIO) model and the Inter-regional ripple effect (IRRE) model. The purpose is to assess the ripple effects of indirect economic loss and spatial heterogeneity of both direct and indirect economic loss at {{the scale of the}} smallest administrative divisions of China (streets, villages, and towns). The results indicate that the district of Beijing with the most severe indirect economic loss is the Chaoyang District; the finance and insurance industry (15, see Table  1) of Chaowai Street suffers the most in the Chaoyang District, which is 1. 46  times that of its <b>direct</b> <b>economic</b> <b>loss.</b> During  2008 – 2014, the average annual GDP (gross domestic product) growth rate of Beijing was decreased 3. 63  % by the catastrophe.

40|$|Abstract. Using {{the daily}} {{precipitation}} and disaster census data of 76 metrological stations in Hubei province from 1960 to 2005, the authors studied the temporal-spatial distributions and disastrous laws of flood.

In this study, the annual variation and geographic {{distribution of the}} <b>direct</b> <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> and fatalities caused by rapid-onset coastal and marine disasters in China have been analysed. This {{was based on a}} collection of historical documents and official records. The five main hazards include storm surges, rough seas, sea ice, red tides and green tides. The results show that: (1) Storm surges caused the most <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> (92 % of the total); (2) At national scale, <b>direct</b> <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> induced by coastal and marine disasters fluctuated with no clear trend; the number of fatalities per year declined, and in relative terms both <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> and fatalities decreased dramatically throughout time; (3) Substantial heterogeneity exists across the 11 provincial-level administrative regions in terms of the spatial pattern and temporal trends of coastal and marine hazards, exposure, vulnerability and observed impacts. Guangzhou, Fujian, Zhejiang and Hainan provinces experienced the highest <b>direct</b> <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> and fatalities due to repeated typhoon-induced storm surges. The decline in adverse impacts caused by hazards is due to substantial progress in coastal and marine disaster prevention and migration in China, largely thanks to institutional measures, plus adaptation and mitigation actions at both national and regional levels. Coastal China still faces growing risks due to socio-economic development, climate change, as well as subsidence and new emerging marine disasters (e. g. green tides). Further management needs to promote integrated solutions across socio-economic development, disaster risk reduction and environmental conservation in coastal regions. This should happen at national and international levels as disasters can affect neighboring countries and their marine environments and socio-ecological systems. Lessons may be learnt from countries experiencing similar problems over the long-term...|$|R
