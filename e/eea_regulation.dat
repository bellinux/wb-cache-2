50|$|In the <b>EEA</b> <b>Regulations,</b> the {{acceptance}} of extended family members is not explicit. UK regulations have specific criteria for extended family members, including unmarried and same sex partners. Once an extended family member has been issued with an EEA family permit, Residence Card or Residence Certificate, they are regarded under UK regulations as family members.|$|R
5000|$|Citizens of {{countries}} in the European Economic Area (other than British and Irish citizens) and Swiss citizens obtain permanent residence status automatically after five years' residence in the United Kingdom exercising Treaty rights [...] rather than ILR.

5000|$|The {{basis of}} the Immigration <b>EEA</b> <b>Regulations</b> 2006 is Directive 2004/38/EC. Member states are bound by the EC {{treaties}} to implement Directives into national law. However, {{a significant amount of}} case law (or precedents), many of them predating the directive, and the historical development (see Freedom of movement for workers) must also be taken into account to correctly interpret EU law. Still, ambiguities in the Directive and misinterpretation by the member states exist ...|$|R
5000|$|The Immigration (European Economic Area) <b>Regulations</b> 2006 (or <b>EEA</b> <b>Regulations</b> for short) {{amended by}} SI 2009/1117, SI 2011/1247 and SI 2015/694 [...] {{constitute}} {{the law that}} implements the right of free movement of EEA nationals and their family members in the United Kingdom. It is based on Directive 2004/38/EC. It allows EEA citizens and their family members {{to live and work}} in the UK without explicit permission. Although Swiss citizens are covered by a separate bilateral agreement they are treated basically the same as EEA nationals. Family members may need a special entry clearance (the EEA family permit) to enter the UK.|$|R
50|$|United Kingdom {{immigration}} {{officers were}} previously {{employees of the}} UK Border Agency, and now work for the Home Office and are appointed by the Home Secretary, whose powers are conferred by the Immigration Act 1971 and who also act in accordance with Immigration Rules. The Immigration Rules are statutory instruments laid down by Parliament under Section 3(2) of the 1971 Act which governs the regulation of entry into the United Kingdom. The Rules are amended by Primary Legislation when required, and provide a framework to ensure that those that come to, or remain in, the UK do so legally, {{and those that do}} not can be removed. Immigration officers' powers over citizens of the European Economic Area (EEA) and their family members are governed by the Immigration (<b>EEA)</b> <b>Regulations</b> 2006.|$|R
40|$|This two-part article reviews how the UK {{authorities}} have fared in the practical application of Directive 2004 / 38 /EC {{in the five}} years since it entered into force. It identifies and examines the most common problems faced by EU citizens when seeking to have their rights recognised by the UK authorities applying the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 by reference to questions and complaints received by Your Europe Advice. In examining the experience of EU citizens and their family members living in the UK, account is taken of a number of recent judgments of the European Court of Justice concerning EU citizenship, including Metock, Lassal, Eman & Sevinger and Ruiz Zambrano. Part 1 covered the scope and beneficiaries of the Directive, the conditions placed on the right of residence, the circumstances under which such a right may be retained and ends with a discussion of the right of permanent residence. Part 2 examines problems relating to residence formalities and obstacles encountered in exercising the right to equal treatment. It then looks at the circumstances where the right of residence may be lost, followed by a discussion of appeal rights. It concludes by providing recommendations for the amendment of both the Directive and the <b>EEA</b> <b>Regulations...</b>|$|R
40|$|The article {{analyzes}} {{adaptations to}} the EU. Focus is on Norway’s {{trade relations with}} the EU {{in the fields of}} food and agriculture. These fields are partially covered by the 1994 <b>EEA</b> Agreement (food <b>regulations)</b> and partly excluded (agricultural policy). The research questions are: 1) How have trade relations with the EU evolved since the EEA Agreement entered into force?; 2) What can explain Norway’s adaptations to the EU? The article shows that Norway has adapted fully on areas covered by formal EEA obligations. However, Norway has gone even further in its adaptations to the EU. These “voluntary” adaptations can partly be explained by an economic logic where issue-linkages and domestic economic interests are at play, and partly by the authorities’ perceived constraints and obligations to cooperate with the EU in trade liberalization. The article shows how a combination of institutional constraints and balancing of economic interests has shaped Norway’s adaptations to the EU, also in areas that were not originally part of the requirements of the EEA Agreement...|$|R
40|$|South African {{affirmative action}} {{law in the}} {{workplace}} is in its infancy. Yet some concepts in this context have already proven to be unclear or in need of interpretation, or are lacking. This thesis focuses on the beneficiaries of affirmative action in employment law. The Employment Equity Act (EEA) creates `designated groups' &# 9472; black people, women and people with disabilities &# 9472; as the beneficiaries of affirmative action. It lays down two requirements for beneficiaries of affirmative action which are investigated: (a) beneficiaries must be from the designated groups - in this regard, the {{question that arises is}} whether, having been categorised as disadvantaged, persons are presumed to be de facto disadvantaged and entitled to benefit from affirmative action, or whether further evidence of actual past disadvantage is required; and (b) beneficiaries must be `suitably qualified'. In addition, citizenship as a third requirement for beneficiaries of affirmative action has been mooted in case law. This is evaluated against modern interpretation theory, the Constitution and discrimination law. Against the background of a comparative investigation of the position in the US and Canada, and under international law, specific findings and recommendations are made in respect of South African affirmative action law. These relate to the interpretation of the concept `disadvantage', to a pragmatic and contextualised approach to the notion `degrees of disadvantage', to the recognition of the concept `multiple disadvantage', to the clarification of the meaning and application of the concept `suitably qualified' in a code of good practice, and to a policy decision by government to ensure that affirmative action measures apply mainly to South African citizens who otherwise qualify to benefit. To this end, certain amendments to the <b>EEA,</b> its <b>regulations</b> and codes of good practice are proposed with the aim of ensuring that affirmative action measures in fact benefit those intended by the EEA. Some projections are made to indicate the way forward for affirmative action in South Africa. JurisprudenceLL. D...|$|R
