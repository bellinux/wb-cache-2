25|$|The first non-fatal {{incident}} was on 30 October 1961. It involved a BUA mainline Vickers Viscount 736 (registration: G-AODH operating an internal German charter flight {{under contract to}} BEA from Berlin Tempelhof Airport to Frankfurt Rhein-Main Airport. While executing a missed approach during an instrument approach to Rhein-Main Airport in poor visibility, the aircraft crash-landed. It struck the ground alongside Rhein-Main's runway 25 and rolled to a stop. There aircraft was damaged beyond repair, {{but there were no}} fatalities among the 16 occupants (four crew and 12 passengers) although a flight attendant and a passenger sustained <b>injuries.</b> <b>Accident</b> investigators concluded that the crash-landing was caused by the captain flying below the critical height in inadequate surface visibility. They furthermore concluded that the assistance the captain received from his co-pilot at the critical moment was erroneous and misleading, and therefore constituted an important contributing factor.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work was to study the dynamic responses and head brain injuries in car-to-pedestrian collisions via accident reconstructions. Six pedestrian accident cases {{were used in the}} reconstructions using mathematical models of the pedestrians and passenger vehicles. The cases were selected from an in-depth analysis of accident data collected through on-the-spot and retrospective investigations and documented in a database in China. The six selected cases provided sufficient data for reconstructions, including details on pedestrian <b>injuries,</b> <b>accident</b> cars, road fixtures and the environment. The reconstruction results were compared with observations and measurements in accident investigations. The correlation of calculated dynamic parameters with registered severity of head brain injury was analysed and realised. The results provided background knowledge for the prediction of head brain injury and the development of pedestrian protection countermeasures...|$|E

40|$|We examine {{factors that}} {{influence}} accident proneness among employees. We agree that the determinants of accident proneness include organizational, emotional and personal factors. Using logistic regression we estimated three models, and their predictability for accident proneness among sample of 200 injured workers interviewed upon entering hospital emergency wards in Israel. Work injuries were not contingent on age, religion, nor education. The effects of gender were strong but non-significant. Subcontracted and higher-paid workers {{are more likely to}} get repeat injuries. Prior injury experience sensitized employees to stronger perceptions of risk associated with unsafe practices. Large family households, ameliorates stress feelings and lessens the likelihood of accident proneness while poor housing conditions have the opposite effect. The full model demonstrates considerable prediction of injuries when focusing on type of employment, personal income level, being involved in dangerous jobs, emotional distress and a poor housing environment.

40|$|Interest in {{osteochondral}} repair {{has been}} increasing with {{the growing number of}} sports-related <b>injuries,</b> <b>accident</b> traumas, and congenital diseases and disorders. Although therapeutic interventions are entering an advanced stage, current surgical procedures are still in their infancy. Unlike other tissues, the osteochondral zone shows a high level of gradient and interfacial tissue organization between bone and cartilage, and thus has unique characteristics related to the ability to resist mechanical compression and restoration. Among the possible therapies, tissue engineering of osteochondral tissues has shown considerable promise where multiple approaches of utilizing cells, scaffolds, and signaling molecules have been pursued. This review focuses particularly on the importance of scaffold design and its role in the success of osteochondral tissue engineering. Biphasic and gradient composition with proper pore configurations are the basic design consideration for scaffolds. Surface modification is an essential technique to improve the scaffold function associated with cell regulation or delivery of signaling molecules. The use of functional scaffolds with a controllable delivery strategy of multiple signaling molecules is also considered a promising therapeutic approach. In this review, we updated the recent advances in scaffolding approaches for osteochondral tissue engineering...|$|E
40|$|Work {{systems are}} {{organized}} groups {{of men and}} technical tools which, through their collaboration in a specific environment, achieve a productive purpose. The performance level of the work system, {{not only in terms}} of productivity, quality and costs, but also in terms of work <b>injuries,</b> <b>accident</b> and safety level in general, can be improved by respecting human limits, needs and expectations in the design of work systems. This goal, a specifically ergonomic one, until now had practical consequences in the technical field mainly with regard to environmental ergonomics and to the physical workspace ergonomic features. On the contrary, the consideration of cognitive issues in work system design is often neglected, notwithstanding it can play an important role in determining the number of work injuries. This is due in particular to the lack of technical instruments able to take into account the cognitive issues and on which the practical development of systems can afford on. In this paper, the authors propose a methodology for the design of work systems with the aim to contribute to overcome the above described lack. This methodology has been developed through the study and the critical evaluation of the conceptual schemes of man-machine interaction, the cognitive interaction models and task analysis methodologies, the analysis of the requirements of a “well designed” work system, the identification of patterns of typical and operatively useful ergonomic cognitive factors determining the performances of the work systems...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{provides}} some results demonstrating {{the impact of}} rain on road safety for France. The risk of <b>injury</b> <b>accident</b> and the added risk in case of rain are estimated for several types of <b>injury</b> <b>accidents</b> which occurred in France for the period 1995 - 2008. Estimations cover the whole of France, in average and according the category of network and element of the road. These results are relevant as they will contribute to implement specific road safety measures. The risk of <b>injury</b> <b>accident</b> in case of rain {{is defined as the}} number of <b>injury</b> <b>accidents</b> per vehicle-kilometre by rainy conditions. The added risk in case of rain is defined as the ratio of the risk of <b>injury</b> <b>accident</b> by rainy conditions divided by the risk of <b>injury</b> <b>accident</b> by no rain. As the number of vehicle kilometres is partly unknown, the rain duration is used in this paper in the place of the number of vehicle-kilometres by rainy conditions. An approximation of the added risk is thus derived. For computing these estimations, two data sources related to <b>injury</b> <b>accidents</b> and rain duration were used: the BAAC (the French <b>Injury</b> <b>Accident</b> File) and Météo-France. In addition, the changes in the added risk in case of rain over the period 1995 - 2008 are described with the help of time series analysis techniques. The results are commented in relation with more detailed results obtained for the Haute-Normandie region in France, and recommendations for improving the computation method are given...|$|R

40|$|In {{comparison}} to {{a previous study}} (See C 1965), this follow-up study determines more specifically {{the effect on the}} number of <b>injury</b> <b>accidents</b> in a large number of 30 km/h zones in the Netherlands. 660 <b>injury</b> <b>accidents</b> in 151 30 km/h zones were recorded: 417 of these were prior to introduction of the measure, and 243 were recorded during the follow-up period. In order to enable correction of effects which were not associated with the realised measure, all <b>injury</b> <b>accidents</b> inside built-up areas were collected for the same municipalities over similar periods (control areas). Following correction based on the trend shown in the control areas, it was determined that the number of <b>injury</b> <b>accidents</b> in the 30 km/h zones had dropped by 22 %. The effect on the number of <b>injury</b> <b>accidents</b> still demonstrated a large variation. The measure can certainly be considered as successful.

40|$|Background. The UN will {{formulate}} ambitious Sustainable Development Goals for 2030, {{including one}} for health. Feasible goals with some quantifiable, measurable targets can influence governments. We propose, as a quantitative health target, “Avoid in each country 40 % of premature deaths (under- 70 deaths that would {{be seen in the}} 2030 population at 2010 death rates), and improve health care at all ages”. Targeting overall mortality and improved health care ignores no modifiable cause of death, nor any cause of disability that is treatable (or also causes many deaths). 40 % fewer premature deaths would be important in all countries, but implies very different priorities in different populations. Reinforcing this target for overall mortality in each country are four global subtargets for 2030 : avoid two-thirds of child and maternal deaths; two-thirds of tuberculosis, HIV, and malaria deaths; a third of premature deaths from non-communicable diseases (NCDs); and a third of those from other causes (other communicable diseases, undernutrition, and injuries). These challenging subtargets would halve under- 50 deaths, avoid a third of the (mainly NCD) deaths at ages 50 – 69 years, and so avoid 40 % of under- 70 deaths. To help assess feasibility, we review mortality rates and trends in the 25 most populous countries, in four country income groupings, and worldwide. Methods. UN sources yielded overall 1970 – 2010 mortality trends. WHO sources yielded cause-specific 2000 – 10 trends, standardised to country-specific 2030 populations; decreases per decade of 42 % or 18 % would yield 20 -year reductions of two-thirds or a third. Results. Throughout the world, except in countries where the effects of HIV or political disturbances predominated, mortality decreased substantially from 1970 – 2010, particularly in childhood. From 2000 – 10, under- 70 age-standardised mortality rates decreased 19 % (with the low-income and lower-middle-income countries having the greatest absolute gains). The proportional decreases per decade (2000 – 10) were: 34 % at ages 0 – 4 years; 17 % at ages 5 – 49 years; 15 % at ages 50 – 69 years; 30 % for communicable, perinatal, maternal, or nutritional causes; 14 % for NCDs; and 13 % for <b>injuries</b> (<b>accident,</b> suicide, or homicide). Interpretation. Moderate acceleration of the 2000 – 10 proportional decreases in mortality could be feasible, achieving the targeted 2030 disease-specific reductions of two-thirds or a third. If achieved, these reductions avoid about 10 million of the 20 million deaths at ages 0 – 49 years that would be seen in 2030 at 2010 death rates, and about 17 million of the 41 million such deaths at ages 0 – 69 years.

Raised median islands, small roundabouts, speed humps and raised tables were implemented in 2000 on this section of a main urban road in a town of 40, 000 inhabitants (length of the treated section: 700  m). All the unmodified sections of the main roads in this town were taken as a comparison group of sites.
