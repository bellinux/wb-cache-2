The present study has the twofold objective of assessing the entity of the deterioration and proposing new cleaning strategies based on nano- biotechnologies.

40|$|Structural {{and surface}} {{property}} changes of macadamia nut-shell (MNS) char upon activation and high temperature treatment (HTT) were studied by high-resolution nitrogen adsorption, diffuse reflectance <b>infra-red</b> <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform</b> <b>spectroscopy,</b> X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and temperature-programmed desorption. It is found that activation of MNS char {{can be divided}} into the low extent activation which may involve the reactions of internal oxygen-containing groups and leads to the formation of comparatively uniform micropores, and the high extent activation which induces reactions between carbon and activating gas and produces a large amount of micropores. The surface functional groups (SFGs) basically increase with the increase of activation extent, but high extent activation preferentially increases the amount of -C-O and -C=O. HTT in air for a short tithe at a high temperature (1173 K) greatly increases the micropore volume and the amounts of SFGs. By appropriately choosing the activation and HTT conditions, it is possible to control both the textural structure and the type and amounts of SFG. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|E

The authors have demonstrated with EPR spectroscopy that cysteine modifies the TiO{sub 2 } surface with formation of new trapping sites where photogenerated electrons and holes are localized. Illumination of cysteine modified TiO{sub 2 } at 77 K resulted in formation of a sulfur centered radical observed by EPR spectroscopy at 200 K. Upon addition of lead ions, a new complex of cysteine that bridges surface titanium atoms and lead ions was detected by IR spectroscopy. Illumination of lead/cysteine modified TiO{sub 2 } {{did not result in}} the formation of sulfur centered radical, but symmetrical, lattice defect type EPR signal for trapped holes was observed. However, addition of methanol to this system resulted in the formation of {center_dot}CH{sub 2 }OH radical following illumination at 8. 2 K. After the temperature was raised to 120 K, doubling of the signal associated with electrons trapped at particle surface (Ti(3) {sub surf}) was observed. On further increase of the temperature to 200 K the EPR signal for trapped electrons disappeared {{as a result of the}} reduction of Pb{sup 2 +} ions, and metallic lead was observed to precipitate. Conversion of photogenerated holes into trapped electrons due to the presence of methanol doubles the yield of trapped electrons that can reduce Pb{sup 2 +}.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{increase}} the understanding of how to design highly active silver-alumina catalysts for selective catalytic reduction of NOx with hydrocarbons (HC-SCR) in oxygen excess at low temperatures (150 - 250 °C). Silver-alumina catalysts have been prepared using different methods, including a new unique preparation method developed during the thesis project. The obtained catalysts have been thoroughly characterized by a range of methods, to determine the chemical and physical properties. The catalytic performance of the samples was determined using flow reactor experiments and mechanistic aspects of the HC-SCR reaction were elucidated by kinetic modeling and in-situ diffuse reflection <b>infra-red</b> <b>Fourier</b> <b>transformed</b> (DRIFT) <b>spectroscopy.</b> The results show that silver-alumina catalysts with highly dispersed silver can be obtained by the new preparation method based on freeze-drying of the silver-alumina gel, formed by the sol-gel method, presented in this thesis. However, the flow reactor experiments showed that to achieve a high NOx reduction activity at low temperatures, both the nature of the reducing agent and the silver loading of the catalyst must be considered. A delicate balance between the oxidative and reductive properties of the catalyst is required, which in turn is dependent on both the silver loading and the preparation method. This balance varies for different reducing agents, most likely due to the different terminal C-H bond strengths in the hydrocarbons. It is suggested that these two factors determine the rate of partial oxidation, required to open up the HC-SCR reaction path. A transient kinetic model for hydrogen assisted n-octane-SCR has been developed, using the reduction of stable surface nitrates by hydrogen as a key-step. The model is able to well reproduce changes in the gas feed, especially poisoning effects by higher NO concentrations in the feed. These results, together with in-situ DRIFT results showing the reduction of surface nitrates by hydrogen, strongly indicate that one important role of hydrogen is to suppress the self-poisoning of the active sites by reduction of surface nitrates...|$|R

However, the presence Of SO 2 in the feed gas decreased the activity of NQ, reduction over AgPd/Al 2 O 3 more greatly than that over Ag/Al 2 O 3. The sulphate species formed on the poisoned Ag-Pd/Al 2 O 3 and Ag/Al 2 O 3 were characterized by BET, inductively couple plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES), XRD, temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and in situ diffuse reflectance <b>infra-red</b> <b>fourier</b> <b>transform</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> (DRIFFS) methods.

The addition of Pd into Ag/Al 2 O 3 promoted the formation of sulphate on the Ag sites in the presence of SO 2, which was considered to be the possible reason for the weak sulphur resistance of Ag-Pd/Al 2 O 3.

The chemical and physical properties of these catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N 2 adsorption/desorption, UV-Vis spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H 2 -TPR) and in situ diffuse reflectance <b>infra-red</b> <b>fourier</b> <b>transform</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> (DRIFTS) techniques. Characterization {{results indicate that the}} morphology of the CeO 2 supports, originating from the selective exposure of different crystal planes, has a distinct impact on the dispersion of Cu and the catalytic properties. The nanooctahedron CeO 2 catalyst (Cu-CeO 2 -O) showed the best dispersion of Cu, the largest amount of moderate copper oxide, and the strongest Cu-support interaction. Consequently, the Cu-CeO 2 -O catalyst exhibited the highest CO conversion at the temperature range of 150 – 250 °C when compared with the nanocube and nanorod Cu-CeO 2 catalysts. The optimized Cu content of the Cu-CeO 2 -O catalysts is 10 wt % and the CO conversion reaches 91. 3 % at 300 °C.

Subsequently, silver (Ag) functionalized composites were tested for their sensitivity and selectivity towards CO 2 gas as a core application. The nanostructured Ag@CuO/ZnO composite demonstrated an improved sensor response of 34 % at 320 °C with response/recovery times of 76 and 265 s compared to the CuO/ZnO composite and control samples. Additionally, the Ag@CuO/ZnO composite displayed excellent recovery (97 %), repeatability (96 %), accuracy (86 %), and lower baseline drifts with a co-efficient of variation (COV) of 4. 5 % measured {{over an extended period}} of 40 days towards 1000 ppm CO 2 gas for 10 individually tested sensors.

40|$|Sediment {{fingerprinting}} is {{a commonly}} employed technique for estimating sediment contributions from various eroding terrestrial sources to fluvial sediment load via a mixing model approach. However, there remain significant shortcomings in sediment fingerprinting practice, specifically relating to difficulties in producing high-temporal resolution apportionment estimates, inconsistencies in mixing model uncertainty representation, {{and a lack}} of attention given to organic matter provenance. Addressing these deficiencies, a combined X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRFS) and diffuse reflectance <b>infra-red</b> <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> (DRIFTS) approach is developed to rapidly, accurately and non-destructively analyse suspended particulate matter (SPM) geochemistry directly from sediment covered quartz fibre filter (QFF) papers at masses as low as 3 mg. An improved Bayesian source apportionment mixing model is then developed which allows for full characterisation of spatial geochemical variability, instrument precision and residual error, to yield a realistic and coherent assessment of the uncertainties associated with sediment fingerprinting estimates. Lastly, a novel application of a coupled molecular and δ 2 H and δ 13 C compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA) of leaf wax n-alkane biomarkers is conducted to demonstrate the apportionment of plant-specific organic matter contributions to streambed sediments. Employing these developments in conjunction with automatic water samplers, high-temporal resolution SPM source apportionment estimates are derived throughout the progression of numerous storm events in a lowland agricultural catchment, revealing significant temporal variability in SPM provenance at 60 - and 120 -min resolution. Lower resolution, weekly, baseflow sampling is also performed, revealing distinct seasonal cycles in SPM geochemistry and sediment source apportionment over a 23 -month period. Collectively, the developments presented in this thesis significantly advance sediment fingerprinting research by enabling organic and inorganic fluvial sediment fractions to be quantitatively apportioned at both low- and high-temporal resolution within realistic levels of uncertainty, thereby enhancing our understanding of sediment dynamics under a range of instream hydrological conditions...|$|E

Its amphoteric chemical property results because of the chemical treatment of the surface of AC with oxidizing agents, reducing agents, and grafting agents. &# 946;-cyclodextrin (&# 946;-CD) {{is a very interesting}} carbohydrate oligomer that provides very strong binding ability for small organic guest molecules in its inner cavity (6. 0 ~ 6. 5 Å) by van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bond formation between the guest molecules and the host. Surface modification of AC with &# 946;-CD was synthesized by chemical methods: oxidation with HNO 3, reduction with LiAlH 4, and grafting &# 946;-CD onto the surface of AC via organic linkers such as glutaraldehyde and 1, 4 -phenylene diisocyanate. This surface grafted AC with &# 946;-CD, then, was evaluated for its surface area and sorption performance by using a solution dye sorption method using dye adsorbates. Surface functional groups produced from oxidation (carboxylic acid, lactone, quinine, phenol, and nitro groups), reduction (alcohol and amine groups), and grafting (imine, hemiacetal, and urethane bonds) methods including microscopy of untreated, surface modified, and grafted ACs were characterized by various surface characterization methods: Diffuse Reflectance <b>Infra-red</b> <b>Fourier</b> <b>Transform</b> <b>Spectroscopy</b> (DRIFTS), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Differential thermogravimetry (DTG), Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time of Flight mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF MS), and Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. A chemical method, the Boehm method, was used for identifying surface bound acidic and basic functional groups. Nitrogen porosimetry was used to analyze the surface area and pore structure characteristics of AC, surface modified ACs, and grafted ACs. p-nitrophenol (PNP) and methylene blue (MB) were used as adsorbates for the dye sorption method. PNP and MB were used to measure the sorption performance of grafted ACs at equilibrium using UV-vis spectrophotometry in aqueous solution. Sorption capacity (Qe), surface area (m 2 /g), and binding affinity characteristics [KF (L/g), KL (g/mol), and KBET (L/g) ] were determined at equilibrium conditions using fundamental sorption models such as Langmuir, Freundlich, and BET isotherms.

40|$|A {{wide variety}} of silica based {{nanoparticles}} (NPs) were synthesised to engineer materials with properties for specific applications by manipulating the nanoparticle composition. These include luminescent core shell NPs and luminescent mesoporous silica which have been successfully synthesised. The particle size distribution and characteristics of the NPs were determined by photon correlation spectroscopy. The laser Doppler velocimetry {{was used to determine}} the NPs stability in suspension. Transmission and scanning electron microscopy analysis were used to assess morphology and size of the NPs. Diffuse reflectance <b>infra-red</b> <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> was used to study the template removal to produce porous NPs. The particles were then utilized for assessing different applications. A novel dual oxygen (O 2) and sulphur dioxide (SO 2) gas sensor was produced by incorporating fluorophores within SiNPs. The fluorophore rhodamine B isothiocyanate (RBITC) was encapsulated within SiNPs (208 ± 9 nm) to produce a nanosensor that is sensitive to SO 2, while ruthenium-tris(4, 7 -diphenyl- 1, 10 -phenanthroline) dichloride (Ru(dpp) 3) was encapsulated within SiNPs (192 ± 8 nm) to sense O 2. The sensor utilises the fluorescence quenching phenomena as a detection mechanism and had high sensitivity for detection of low O 2 gas concentrations (0. 018 %). These novel nanosensors demonstrate potential to develop multisensor systems to capable of detecting multiple gasses simultaneously in a single matrix for a magnitude of future applications that require small robust gas sensing. Biocompatibility of SiNP number, size (smaller than 100 nm), and dye encapsulation on conduit arterial function, in vitro was assessed. Their effects on endothelial-dependent [acetylcholine (ACh); 0. 01 - 200 M] and independent [sodium nitroprusside (SNP); 0. 001 - 10 M] dilator responses were examined. When incubated with 1. 96 × 1012 NP/ mL, both 30 nm, 70 nm SiNPs and RBITC encapsulated in silica nanoparticles (SiRBITC NPs) significantly reduced endothelium-dependent, but not independent vasodilation. Furthermore, attenuated dilation due to SiRBITC NPs, but not SiNPs, could be partially restored using superoxide dismutase. Our results suggest that the mechanism of attenuated dilation is different for SiNPs and SiRBITC NPs which has implications for the future fabrication of biocompatible nanoparticles for imaging diagnostics. Spherical mesoporous nanoparticles (MNP) and dye encapsulated MNP were synthesised via a sol-gel method in XXIII the presences of organic template. The template was removed using an acidic extraction. The average diameters of the MNP were 100 nm. The interior pores were loaded with SNP, these drug loaded MNP were placed in live tissue and release in real-time was observed, in vitro. We demonstrate that the initial instantaneous release is due to the surface adsorption of the drug followed by released from the pores. Furthermore, these drug loaded MNP were placed in live tissue and release in real-time was observed, in vitro. ...|$|E
