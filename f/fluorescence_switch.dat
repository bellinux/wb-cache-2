40|$|Photochromic spiropyrans {{modified}} with fluorophores {{were investigated}} as molecular platforms for {{the achievement of}} fluorescence switching through modulation of energy transfer. The dyads were designed {{in such a way}} that energy transfer is only observed for the open forms of the photochrome (merocyanine and protonated merocyanine), whereas the closed spiropyran is inactive as an energy acceptor. This was made possible through a deliberate choice of fluorophores (4 -amino- 1, 8 -naphthalimide, dansyl, and perylene) that produce zero spectral overlap with the spiro form and considerable overlap for the merocyanine forms. From the Förster theory, energy transfer is predicted to be highly efficient and in some cases of 100 [*]% efficiency. The combined switching by photonic (light of λ> 530  nm) and chemical (base) inputs enabled the creation of a sequential logic device, which is the basic element of a keypad lock.
