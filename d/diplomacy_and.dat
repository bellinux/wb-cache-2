5|$|The rise of Macedon, {{from a small}} kingdom at the {{periphery}} of classical Greek affairs to one which came to dominate the entire Hellenic world (and beyond), occurred {{in the span of}} just 25 years, between 359 and 336 BC. This ascendancy is largely attributable to the personality and policies of Philip II (r. 359–336 BC). In addition to utilising effective <b>diplomacy</b> <b>and</b> marriage alliances to achieve his political aims, Philip II was also responsible for reforming the ancient Macedonian army into an effective fighting force. The Macedonian phalanx became the hallmark of the Macedonian army during his reign and the subsequent Hellenistic period. His army and engineers also made extensive use of siege engines.|$|E
5|$|Three episodes proved {{fundamental}} to the administrative and political unification of Germany. First, the death without male heirs of Frederick VII of Denmark led to the Second War of Schleswig in 1864. Second, the unification of Italy provided Prussia an ally against Austria in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. Finally, France—fearing Hohenzollern encirclement—declared war on Prussia in 1870, resulting in the Franco-Prussian War. Through a combination of Bismarck's <b>diplomacy</b> <b>and</b> political leadership, von Roon's military reorganization, and von Moltke's military strategy, Prussia demonstrated {{that none of the}} European signatories of the 1815 peace treaty could guarantee Austria's sphere of influence in Central Europe, thus achieving Prussian hegemony in Germany and ending the dualism debate.|$|E
