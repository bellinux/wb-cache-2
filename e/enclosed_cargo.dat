5000|$|In 1981, Cimos {{began to}} produce a {{specific}} model, the ‘Dak,’ an <b>enclosed</b> <b>cargo</b> utility vehicle, {{very similar to the}} ‘fourgonette.’’ The basis was an unstretched ‘Diana’ chassis, unlike the French ‘Acadiane,’ which was based on the longer chassis of the 2CV AK400. [...] It also prepared a pick up truck from the same basis. Sales were 2,200 ‘Dak’ and 900 ‘Geri.’ ...|$|E
50|$|The DJ-5A (Kaiser Co.) used a {{standard}} CJ front end, with a four-cylinder Chevrolet Nova 153 CID L engine and two-speed Powerglide automatic transmission. In 1971, this {{was changed to}} a unique five-slot grille without turn signals that was used only on postal Jeeps. The 1971 model actually has the grille extend past {{the front of the}} hood edge. This allowed more room for the AMC Straight-6 engine and radiator. While resembling the CJ series, these were built as a completely enclosed, rear-wheel drive vehicle, with sliding doors (which could be opened while driving), and a swinging rear door. Most models only had the driver's seat and a mail tray where the second seat would normally be located. One improvement over earlier Jeeps was mounting the rear springs outside of the frame rails, thus providing greater stability for the vehicle with its top-heavy <b>enclosed</b> <b>cargo</b> area, especially at highway speeds. Most models were also equipped with a limited slip differential and a heavy-duty steering gearbox.|$|E
50|$|Box-type {{trucks with}} glass panels <b>enclosing</b> the <b>cargo</b> space {{can be turned}} into a mobile 3D display case. Many {{companies}} use these trucks for parades, product launches, furniture displays, and general rapid-awareness creation. Almost anything can be placed inside of the boxes for display.|$|R
50|$|Cargo volume: Station wagons {{prioritize}} passenger {{and cargo}} volume, with windows alongside the cargo volume. Of the two body styles, a station wagon's roof (viewed in profile) more likely {{extends to the}} very rearmost of the vehicle, <b>enclosing</b> a full-height <b>cargo</b> volume, whereas a hatchback roof (especially a liftback roof) typically rakes down steeply behind the C-Pillar, prioritizing style over interior volume, and resulting in shorter rear overhang and smaller, or absent, windows {{either side of the}} cargo volume.|$|R

5000|$|The modern compact SUV {{models were}} {{introduced}} in 1983. General Motors released the two-door Chevrolet S-10 Blazer, a four-wheel drive wagon with a four-cylinder engine as standard. Mid-year, Ford brought out the Ford Bronco II. Both models were body-on-frame designs based on each automaker's small pickup trucks, the Chevrolet S-10 and Ford Ranger respectively. Chevrolet's S-10 pickup based baby Blazer came with an all-steel, permanent roof and a top-hinged rear hatch. The Bronco II's general dimensions, drive train, and cab details were identical {{to those of the}} compact truck with differences in the interior only aft of the doors. Both were station wagon-like vehicles with seating for four adults and an <b>enclosed</b> <b>cargo</b> area, while their similar compact truck versions that would normally fit two and have an open load bed.The first purpose-designed unibody compact SUV, and the first with four-doors, was the Jeep Cherokee (XJ). It was introduced by American Motors Corporation in 1983 for the 1984 model year and was produced almost unchanged through 2001 in the U.S., and through 2005 in China. Automobile magazine called it a [...] "masterpiece" [...] of automotive design with room for five passengers and their cargo.|$|E
5000|$|The {{more common}} four track Tucker Sno-Cats are {{considered}} to be the classic Sno-Cats in American history and have been used extensively in both polar regions for exploration, as well as for transportation, trail grooming and industrial applications. The body style could be configured in many ways and sedan styles, <b>enclosed</b> <b>cargo</b> styles and open bed configurations were all available. Model numbers designated the configuration of the unit, for example a Model 342 was a [...] "300" [...] series, four-track, two-door Tucker Sno-Cat. A Model 443 would be a [...] "400" [...] series, four-track, three-door unit. In the early models, there were ultimately series 200 through 900, with the higher numbers being larger units. The 500 series Tuckers employed extra wide tracks which allowed them to carry heavy loads in very deep soft snow conditions. The early model Tucker Sno-Cats all utilized a unique steel track that revolved around a steel pontoon, the steel pontoons were eventually replaced by fiberglass pontoons. As the models evolved, the steel tracks were replaced with a suspension system that employed rubber belts that were carried by a series of small wheels. Fastened to the exterior of the rubber belts are cleats, also called grousers, made of metal, to offer traction on the snow.|$|E
5000|$|The {{idea of a}} car-based pickup {{remains an}} {{attractive}} one, and is an illustration of how favorable treatment for light trucks over cars by United States regulations skews the marketplace. Many Ranchero and El Camino owners, indeed, stopped buying new vehicles when those models were discontinued. Aftermarket conversions of the Fairmont Futura and Mercury Zephyr Z7 sport coupes to a Ranchero-like [...] "Durango" [...] pickup were sold in select Ford dealers in the early- to mid-1980s. Recently, interest in producing such vehicles again has grown, including those like the Subaru Baja, essentially an Outback station wagon with a stubby pickup bed instead of an <b>enclosed</b> <b>cargo</b> area. The Baja, like the Ranchero, is titled in most American states and Canadian provinces as a commercial vehicle. Until the late-2000s, the North American market tended to lean towards compact and midsized crew-cab four-door pickups such as the Ford Explorer Sport Trac and Chevrolet Colorado. However, with the compact pickups having grown towards midsized and encroaching on base models of more profitable full-sized pickups, some manufacturers such as Ford and Ram Trucks have discontinued even their compact and midsized offerings; Ford discontinued the North American Ranger in 2012 and opted not to sell its global replacement in North America due to being too close in size and price to the base model Ford F-150.|$|E
50|$|Why {{do we need}} Marine Chemist? Lets take {{a moment}} to examine that question. Basic ship design... open decks and <b>enclosed</b> spaces for <b>cargoes...</b> has {{remained}} basically unchanged for decades. Structural materials and methods have changed, but in principle, the basic design concept has been the same for centuries. Today's cargoes, however, have shifted to a greater number of toxic substances. That has added the health concern of toxicity to the existing safety concerns of fire and explosion, not just during a voyage, but even when a vessel is in a shipyard for routine maintenance and repair.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{cargo ships}} {{specially}} fitted for {{the transport of}} large quantities of cars came into service in the early sixties. These ships still had their own loading gear and so-called hanging decks inside. They were, for example, chartered by the German Volkswagen AG to transport vehicles in the U.S. and Canada. During the 1970s, the market for exporting and importing cars has increased dramatically and the number and type of ROROs has increased also. In 1970 Japan’s K Line built the [...] "Toyota Maru No. 10", Japan's first pure car carrier, and in 1973 built the European Highway, the largest pure car carrier (PCC) at that time, which carried 4,200 automobiles. Today’s pure car carriers and their close cousins, the pure car/truck carrier (PCTC), are distinctive ships with a box-like superstructure running the entire length and breadth of the hull, fully <b>enclosing</b> the <b>cargo.</b> They typically have a stern ramp and a side ramp for dual loading of thousands of vehicles (such as cars, trucks, heavy machineries, tracked units, Mafi trailers, and loose statics), and extensive automatic fire control systems.|$|R
40|$|Vps 34, {{the sole}} PtdIns 3 -kinase in yeast, is {{essential}} for autophagy. Here, we show that the lipidkinase activity of Vps 34 is required for autophagy, implying an essential role of its product PtdIns(3) P. The protein-kinase activity of Vps 15, a regulatory subunit of the PtdIns 3 -kinase complex, is also required for efficient autophagy. We monitored the distribution of PtdIns(3) P in living cells using a specific indicator, the 2 xFYVE domain derived from mammalian Hrs. PtdIns(3) P was abundant at endosomes and on the vacuolar membrane during logarithmic growth phase. Under starvation conditions, we observed massive transport of PtdIns(3) P into the vacuole. This accumulation was dependent on the membrane dynamics of autophagy. Notably, PtdIns(3) P was highly enriched and delivered into the vacuole {{as a component of}} autophagosome membranes but not as a <b>cargo</b> <b>enclosed</b> within them, implying direct involvement of this phosphoinositide in autophagosome formation. We also found a possible enrichment of PtdIns(3) P on the inner autophagosomal membrane compared to the outer membrane. Based on these results we discussthe function of PtdIns(3) P in autophagy...|$|R
40|$|Phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) by PtdIns 3 -kinase is {{essential}} for autophagy. However, the distribution and function of the enzymatic product, PtdIns 3 -phosphate (PtdIns(3) P), has been unknown. We monitored PtdIns(3) P distribution during autophagy by live imaging, biochemistry, and electron microscopy, and found that PtdIns(3) P is massively delivered into the vacuole via autophagy. PtdIns(3) P is highly enriched as a membrane component of the elongating isolation membranes and autophagosome membranes {{rather than as an}} <b>enclosed</b> <b>cargo,</b> implying direct involvement of PtdIns(3) P in autophagosome formation. This observation also provides important basic information {{on the nature of the}} autophagosome membrane, which is still poorly understood. Notably, PtdIns(3) P is highly enriched on the inner (concave) surfaces of the isolation membrane and autophagosome compared to the outer surfaces. PtdIns(3) P is also enriched on ambiguous structures juxtaposed to the elongating tips of isolation membranes. We also investigated the function of PtdIns(3) P in autophagy, and show that PtdIns(3) P recruits the Atg 18 -Atg 2 complex to autophagic membranes through an Atg 18 -PtdIns(3) P interaction. Interestingly, PtdIns(3) P is required only for the association of the Atg 18 -Atg 2 complex to autophagic membranes but not for any subsequent functional activity of the Atg 18 -Atg 2 complex, suggesting that PtdIns(3) P does not act allosterically on Atg 18. Based on these results we discuss the function of PtdIns(3) P in autophagy...|$|E
40|$|Physical {{security}} {{technologies have}} been unable to address most `Trojan Horse' scenarios at vehicle portals which provide access through the perimeter of a secure area. Thorough visual searches of vehicle cargo containers are time consuming, involve a number of security personnel and are cursory at best. Vehicles entering or exiting a protected site provide an adversary with an easy pathway across secure boundaries. A method to detect the presence of persons hiding within a vehicle's <b>enclosed</b> <b>cargo</b> container has been developed by LQckheed Martin Energy Systems. The system measures vibrations coupled to the container and generated by the human heart. Each time the human heart beats, it generates a small but measurable shock wave. This shock wave is propagated through the body and transmitted to anything with which the body has contact. This wave is referred to as a baflistocardiograrn and is the mechanical equivalent to an electrocardiogram. Systems have been installed in several State prisons and have been independently tested and evaluated. The effectiveness of the system has been determined by the Thunder Mountain Evaluation Center at Fort Huachuca. Arizona. Sympathetic vibrations of the cargo container's surface can be collected using any of several detection methods, i. e. infrared, Doppler microwave, Doppler ultrasonic wave and geophones. The analog signal delivered by the sensors is passed through an amplifier and a low pass filter and then fed to a microprocessor via an analog to digital converter. When initiated by the operator, anafog signals are recorded for a specific interval of time and rate. At the end of the recording intervaL the data are analysed using wavelet transform techniques and compared with a ballistocardiographic template. If the collected data are similar, the system informs the operator that there is a high degree of probability that a person is within the vehicle. The paper describes in depth the development of the system, system operation, and system software and hardware, and discusses the algorithm, current development activities, testing, and actual usage of the system for the protection of nuclear facilities and State prisons. It focuses on technologies being evaluated for future iterations of the system and applications other than the protection of perimeters...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the first}} {{introduction}} by Seeman {{in the early}} 1980 s, structural DNA nanotechnology has been rapidly developed {{over the past three}} decades. Many advanced DNA self-assembly strategies are invented, which has been successful utilized for the construction of various one, two and three dimensional DNA nanostructures. Comparing to the considerably mature self-assembly methodology, the functionalities of DNA nanostructures are relatively underdeveloped. Hence, for the work of this thesis, we have focused more towards the integration of responsive functions with DNA nanostructures. Besides, we also have devoted effort to obtaining sub-nanometer level information on DNA double-crossover molecule, which is beneficial to the overall development of structural DNA nanotechnology. ^ Firstly, we incorporated the idea of DNA nano-motor into DNA nanoparticles, which leaded to the construction and characterization of a “smart” DNA nanocage that could isothermally assemble/dissociate upon pH changes. This reversible assembly/dissociate strategy could be readily adapted for other DNA nanocages, for instance, DNA octahedron and icosahedron. The environment-responsive behavior would be important for potential applications of DNA nanocages, such as on-demand drug release. ^ Secondly, we developed a step-wised strategy to assemble ATP-responsive, Russian doll-like, multi-layered DNA nanocages. The layer-by-layer assembly method provided a generally compatible solution for achieving high structural complexity. It could also be readily applied to other DNA nanostructures, including DNA origami and single-stranded-tile structures. Additionally, the ATP-responsive ability of the DNA nanocages was demonstrated to function efficiently at biologically relevant ATP concentration. Hence, such stimuli-responsive property suggested a way for controllable release of <b>cargos</b> <b>enclosed</b> in nanocages. ^ Thirdly, we came up with a method to report transient molecular events by specialized DNA strand displacement. DNA triplexes are involved in some biological processes, for example, gene expression activity. Yet, the C-containing DNA triplex exists at low concentration with a short lifetime in the cells, making its detection a great challenge. We addressed such issue by applying the strategy of conditioned strand displacement, which coupled the triplex formation with a DNA strand displacement reaction. The developed method was proved to be able to detect DNA triplex formation at wide pH range. ^ Lastly, we assembled and characterized a rationally designed DNA crystal which used double-crossover (DX) motif as basic building block. Upon successfully solving the X-ray crystal structure, we were able to obtain sub-nanometer level structural information of DX motif. Such information provided the field with better understanding of DX motif, which was useful for the development of advanced DNA self-assembly strategies. For instance, a super-helical feature hidden in the network of DNA lattice was first identified, which helped explain how DNA molecules compromised internal stress. ...|$|R
