40|$|If {{a street}} vendor offers a famous brand-name product for a {{substantially}} lower price than one would expect, {{the average consumer}} 2 ̆ 7 s initial reaction might be that the product had been stolen or was 2 ̆ 2 hot 2 ̆ 2 - {{a product of the}} black market. While such discounted goods might indeed be stolen, sophisticated consumers have come to expect similar discounts in stores and mail-order houses throughout the country on goods not from the black market but rather from the 2 ̆ 2 gray market. 2 ̆ 2 These products, naturally enough, are called 2 ̆ 2 gray market goods 2 ̆ 2 or simply 2 ̆ 2 <b>gray</b> <b>goods.</b> 2 ̆ 2 <b>Gray</b> <b>goods</b> are brand-name products manufactured abroad which bear an authentic trademark authorized by the owner of the trademark in the market for which the goods are intended. The owner of the trademark is usually foreign. These goods are normally intended for markets outside the United States at the time of manufacture. At some point, however, the <b>gray</b> <b>goods</b> are 2 ̆ 2 diverted 2 ̆ 2 or imported into the United States for the purpose of competing with the U. S. trademark owner 2 ̆ 7 s authorized goods. Historically, the importation of <b>gray</b> <b>goods</b> was rare and sporadic. As a consequence, the U. S. Customs Service 2 ̆ 7 s regulations which permit their importation were ignored. <b>Gray</b> <b>goods,</b> as a legal topic, were confined to the backwaters of antitrust and intellectual property law. In the last few years, however, the importation of <b>gray</b> <b>goods</b> has become a growth industry and has generated numerous lawsuits and commentaries. While the initial growth in the gray market was spurred by the very high value of the U. S. dollar in international currency markets, it appears that now a permanent gray market network has developed that will make the subject of gray-goods importation one of importance for years to come regardless {{of the value of the}} dollar...|$|E

40|$|The U. S. Supreme Court’s recent {{ruling in}} Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley 2 ̆ 6 Sons would seem no trivial event for {{stakeholders}} in content-reliant industries. The upshot of the Court’s decision — that the Copyright Act {{cannot be used}} to prevent the unauthorized importation of copies of works, even if manufactured abroad, whose “first sale” has already occurred — will, at least initially, throw a wrench into many companies’ existing business models. As one would expect, commentary on the decision has been extensive. With few exceptions, however, commentators attempting to predict the impact of Kirtsaeng have not looked beyond copyright law to understand the broader legal landscape in which so-called “gray goods” are situated. That landscape includes, among other features, the Federal Circuit’s doctrine on rights exhaustion in patent law, {{the growing number of}} state laws regulating retailers’ sales of <b>gray</b> <b>goods,</b> and the now-widespread use of licenses to restrict the transferability of goods — especially of the digital variety. As these examples show, the Kirtsaeng ruling does not exist in a vacuum. Indeed, when one examines what is arguably the most significant feature of the gray-goods landscape in the United States — federal trademark law — it is difficult not to wonder if the Supreme Court’s ruling will have much of an impact at all. Even a cursory examination of trademark law’s gray-goods jurisprudence reveals that it has become untethered from both its supposed consumer protection and brand-goodwill rationales, opting for an approach that unduly favors trademark owners. Kirtsaeng notwithstanding, trademark law is where the action is...|$|E

40|$|Although {{it has the}} {{appearance}} of benefiting the consumer, the phenomenon of <b>gray</b> market <b>goods</b> is, for the most part, a species of unfair competition. Where an exclusive distribution contract between foreign and domestic entities enhances interbrand competition and satisfies a rule of reason analysis, it {{should be considered a}} protectable property interest. There is little justification for permitting gray market imports to interfere with that interest by taking advantage of the good will associated with the distribution, marketing, warranties and servicing provided by the United States distributor. The antitrust goal of promoting long-run consumer interests is not advanced by conduct which misleads consumers as to warranties and servicing, by false advertising and by disrupting distribution systems geared towards increasing interbrand competition. This type of conduct exceeds the desirable bounds of competitive behavior. The competitive process suffers unless there is a commercial environment amenable to efficiency and progress. To the extent that <b>gray</b> market <b>goods</b> impede the incentive for vigorous interbrand competition,they imperil this process...|$|R

40|$|Under the {{influence}} of the technology tools and the internet, the firms not only face to the single consumer, but the group as a whole. If there are more consumers in the group, then the individual will get the higher utility. Therefore, the firm should think about that how to attract more consumers join the group. Under this situation, would the competition between agent and gray marketer change? This is our study concerned about. We found out a phenomenon that sometimes agent will treat gray marketer well. That's opposite from our intuition, and that's why this study are interested for. After testing by our model, we found out that network externalities will really lead the emergence of <b>gray</b> market <b>goods,</b> and the <b>gray</b> market <b>goods</b> are bring not absolutely damage for the agent. Because <b>gray</b> market <b>goods</b> help the network externalities become bigger, and that's good for both agent and gray marketer. Our study not only think from agent's side but also manufacture's, because the pricing strategy of manufacturer will influence the competition degree between agent and gray marketer, that tells the role of manufacturer is very important. 在科技工具以及網際網路的影響下，廠商所面對的不再只是單一個消費者，而是面對整個群體。若在該群體內的消費者越多，則個別消費者所感受到的效用會越高，因此，廠商應思索如何吸引更多的消費者加入群體內。在這樣的情境下，代理商和水貨商原先的競爭狀態是否會因此有所改變?這是本研究所關注的問題；從實務上發現，某些時候代理商會善待水貨商，而這和一般直覺上的認知有所不同，代理商和水貨商分別代表的是授權和未授權的通路，所以雙方應該為相互敵對的狀況，然而是什麼原因會讓代理商有誘因來對水貨商好，這就是本研究想要尋找的答案。 而從本研究的模型推導所得到的結果中發現，在網路外部性確實會促使水貨的出現；並且水貨的出現帶給代理商的也並非絕對的傷害，這是因為代理商可將部分願付價格較低的消費者讓水貨商來服務，如此一來，不僅能擴大網路外部性的程度，對於代理商和水貨商來說，也能創造雙贏的局面。 而本研究除了在站代理商的角度去思考外，也另外探討了製造商的決策；由於製造商對於本國及外國市場的定價除了會影響到水貨數量的多寡之外，對於水貨在外國市場和公司貨的競爭程度以及對於製造商本身的獲利來說都有極大的關聯，因此製造商的角色是非常重要的。第一章 緒論 [...] 1 第一節 研究背景與動機 [...] 1 第二節 研究目的 [...] 2 第三節 研究問題 [...] 3 第二章 文獻回顧 [...] 4 第一節 灰色市場 [...] 4 第二節 網路外部性 [...] 9 第三章 模型設定與假設 [...] 14 第四章 基本模型 [...] 15 第一節 代理商均衡價格之推導及意涵 [...] 15 第二節 外在參數對代理商均衡價格之影響 [...] 22 第五章 延伸模型 [...] 37 第一節 直接通路之模型設定 [...] 37 第二節 直接通路之模型推導 [...] 38 第三節 間接通路之模型設定 [...] 47 第四節 間接通路之模型推導 [...] 48 第六章 結論與建議 [...] 51 第一節 主要結論與實務意涵 [...] 51 第二節 研究限制與未來研究建議 [...] 54 參考文獻 [...] 56 附錄一 [...] 58 附錄二 [...] 5...|$|R
