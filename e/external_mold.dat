Methods have been described for reconstructing diaphyseal cross sections from <b>external</b> <b>molds</b> and biplanar radiographs that produce accurate results (within 5 % of true values on average). The manual image processing required, however, is both time and labor intensive. A new freely available program developed here for the computational freeware, R, automates much of the process. This study compares cross-sectional properties calculated using the new R program to those from peripheral quantitative CT (pQCT) and the original manual method. We find that the R program works aswell as the original manual image processing for most cross sections eliminates the chance for entry errors at several steps and greatly speeds up data collection...|$|R

40|$|Pleistocene-age methane seep carbonates {{from the}} Eel River Basin, California contain aggregate-like {{structures}} composed of tightly-packed hollow spheres that morphologically resemble syntrophic archaeal–bacterial consortia known to catalyze the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). Tetragonal microstructures {{also present in}} the carbonates resemble seep-endemic Methanosarcinales cell clusters. Despite morphological similarities to the seep-endemic microbes that likely mediated the authigenesis of Eel River Basin carbonates and sulfides, detailed petrographic, SEM, and magnetic microscopic imaging, remanence rock magnetism, laser Raman, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, suggest that these microstructures are not microfossils, but rather mineral structures that result from the diagenetic alteration of euhedral Fe-sulfide framboids. Electron microscopy shows that during diagenesis, reaction rims composed of Fe oxide form around framboid microcrystalites. Subsequent dissolution of greigite or pyrite crystals leaves behind hollow cell-like casings (<b>external</b> <b>molds)</b> — a transformation that occurs on timescales of ~ 100 kyr or less.

In this study fibular/tibial strength was determined in OH 35, a Homo habilis (or possibly Paranthropus boisei), (1. 8 myr) and KNM-WT 15000, a juvenile Homo erectus, (1. 5 myr), and was compared to modern humans (n= 79), chimpanzees (n= 16), gorillas (n= 16) and orangutans (n= 11). Ontogenetic changes in fibular/tibial strength were also analyzed due to KNM-WT 15000 ’s juvenile status. Cross-sectional properties were derived from multi-plane radiography and either CT sections of casts (fossils) or <b>external</b> <b>molds</b> (extant). RMA regressions were run on polar second moment of area (J), a measure of torsional and average bending rigidity, of the fibula against that of the tibia for all extant species. Fossils were analyzed using their relative deviations from each regression line, expressed in SEE units. Great apes differed significantly from humans in regression line elevation, with relatively stronger fibulae. OH 35 fell in the center of the great ape distribution, within 1 SEE of each great ape taxon, but 1. 9 SEE from humans. KNM-WT 15000 was more than 2 SEE from all great apes and within 0. 6 SEE of humans. This was not a result of his age, as fibular/tibial strength slightly decreases with age in humans. OH 35 has some human-like features; however, the relative strength of the two bones aligns the specimen with great apes, suggesting a significant degree of arboreality. KNM-WT 15000 is demonstrated to be fully modern, complimenting other evidence for complete terrestrial bipedality...|$|R

40|$|Agricultural Sciences, University of Florida on the {{conservation}} of forages as round bale silage. Grasses and legumes have been harvested using conventional hay making equipment and ensiled as large, round bales of high moisture forage sealed in plastic. When compared to hay, round bale silage offers an alternative forage conservation system that decreases {{the amount of time}} spent drying the forage prior to storage. The benefits of this system include reduced rain damage and field losses, and increased flexibility in scheduling harvesting (allowing producers to harvest for optimum forage quality and yield). When compared with chopped silage, the benefits of round bale silage include excellent dry matter recovery, decreased energy costs and lowered initial capital investment. Main disadvantages are increased capital investment and costs for expendable supplies (when the system is compared to hay), and the susceptibility of plastic used to store round bale silage to rodent damage and deterioration under intense sunlight. Field wilting (to increase dry matter at time of storage to 40 to 50 %) improves the quality of round bale silage made under Florida conditions. Three to four hours usually is required to accomplish this degree of wilt with bermudagrass. Adding ammonia to round bale silage prevents <b>external</b> <b>molding</b> but may result in undesirable fermentation characteristics, especially when high moisture, tropical forages are ensiled. Microbial inoculation (to promote lactic acid production) temporarily improves the quality of direct-cut, high moisture (< 30 % dry matter) round bale silage made with bermudagrass, but pH of inoculated silage generally is not lowered enough to stabilize such silage in a high-quality state. The combination of cellulase-enzyme treatment and inoculation, however, has shown potential to improve the quality of bermudagrass round bale silage...|$|R
40|$|The late Eocene–early Oligocene Keasey Formation in Northwestern Oregon {{contains}} a unique fauna of deep-water (> 200 m) marine bivalves preserved in sparsely fossiliferous massive tuffaceous siltstone {{as well as}} in several distinctive cold-seep limestone bodies and carbonate layers. The Keasey gastropod fauna has been described previously, but this treatment of the anomalodesmatan bivalves is the first systematic account for any portion of the bivalve fauna. Cenozoic evolutionary radiation and history of anomalodesmatans is less well known than their deep Paleozoic and Mesozoic history. Because internal relationships are not well resolved, ranked classification is not used above the family level, while recognizing that these rare and unusual bivalves do represent a monophyletic assemblage nested within the basal heterodonts. Six species in four anomalodesmatan families in the Keasey Formation shed new light on the Cenozoic history of the group as well as the Eocene appearance of precursors of the living deep-water fauna of the northeastern Pacific. The families represented are Pandoridae, Thraciidae, Periplomatidae, and Cuspidariidae. The new species are Pandora eocapsella, Thracia keaseyensis, Cardiomya anaticepsella, and Cardiomya pavascotti. Aperiploma? n. sp. is described in open nomenclature pending discovery of additional and more complete material. Although shells are frequently crushed and the exterior shell layers are often poorly preserved, the interior nacre is distinctive, well-preserved and useful for recognizing fragments in the field. Characteristic anomalodesmatan granules are well preserved on many specimens of the new thraciid, and the fine-grained matrix at some localities preserves shell features on <b>external</b> <b>molds</b> where no original shell material remains. High-resolution images of uncoated shell encourage greater attention to collection of fragments and imperfect specimens in the fine-grained deep-water facies on the active margin of the Pacific...|$|R

40|$|In this study, an <b>external</b> gas-assisted <b>mold</b> {{temperature}} control combined with water cooling {{was applied to}} achieve rapid mold-surface {{temperature control}} for observing the melt flow length in the thin-wall injection molding process. Variable part-thickness values of 0. 2 mm, 0. 4 mm, and 0. 6 mm were used.

40|$|The Upper Miocene to Pliocene Sijes Formation {{consists}} of a thick sequence of continental sediments and is of major economic importance because it contains the beds of borate minerals that are being exploited in the Puna. Radiometrically dated as between 7 and 4 Ma, it contains only a few fossils, principally diatoms, the remains of birds, and plant fragments, none of which have stratigraphic significance. <b>External</b> <b>molds</b> of small gastropods discovered recently in the Esperanza (upper) Member of the Sijes Formation near the Sol de Ma&# 241;ana borate mine in the Salar of Pastos Grandes represent the first identifiable remains {{of this kind of}} organism in these deposits. The Esperanza Member, about 780 m thick, is composed of beds of clastic alluvial fan sediments that are overlain by fine grained clastics, then gray tuffs and pumicites that have been dated at 5. 9 Ma by the fission-track method. A sequence of rythmically bedded lacustrine muds and evaporites overlies the volcaniclastic beds. The gastropod-bearing sediment, an altered volcanic ash, is near the base of this lacustrine section. A fission-track date from a volcanic ash {{near the top of the}} section is 4. 0 Ma. A disconformity separates the top of the Esperanza Member from a 2, 000 m thick Pliocene conglomerate. The gastropods recovered are a new species of Littoridina, a lacustrine genus that is widely distributed in lakes that range from nearly fresh water to very salty water. Generally, living species of Littoridina are small, fragile, and unornamented; they live on a firm substrate of fine-grained sediments in a permanent body of water that does not become highly turbid. Their presence in lacustrine sediments of the Sijes Formation indicates that the lake, though undoubtedly salty at the time, probably was deep enough that the snails generally were below wave base or lived in an environment, perhaps on rooted plants, that did not become highly turbid. Littoridina probably was transported to this lake on the feet or feathers of birds. The genus is dioecious, but a fertilized female of another genus in the family (Amnicola) is capable of depositing viable eggs throughout the year, as long as the water remains at an appropriate temperature.

40|$|Modern Lebanon’s {{political}} sectarian {{system is}} the result of many years of <b>external</b> forces <b>molding</b> the territory and its sociopolitical structures to align with international interests. Civic spaces in Lebanon, and women’s activity within these spaces, is dictated by sectarian dynamics within its politics and society. This paper explores the evolution of the Lebanese state and sectarianized experiences of citizenship in relation to the external forces that shaped the “Lebanese System” in place today. Beginning in the late Ottoman and French Mandate periods, it identifies the key players in state formation both under colonial rule and later, as a sovereign state, a failing state in civil war, a post-conflict society. Finally, it frames Lebanon as a case study in 21 st-century Middle East politics. It argues that the sectarian sociopolitical structure and gendered social and legal understandings of citizenship preclude any unified experience of public life across the Lebanese system, and thus prevents women from engaging fully in both Lebanese civic life and of their position as citizens in the global system. It is crucial to understand the ways in which gendered, sectarian civic spaces have formed and continue to evolve as it is within these spaces where civil societies develop. This study identifies points of entry to civic life for women within the major Lebanese sects, as well as barriers to complete participation. It supports the consideration of gendered modes of civic participation within the larger framework of transnational politics, particularly in relation to Lebanon’s continued strategic importance to regional and international actors...|$|R
