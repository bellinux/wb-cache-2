25|$|In the US, {{during the}} 1960s, Bell {{licensed}} {{and sold the}} Saunders-Roe SR.N5 as the Bell SK-5. They were deployed on trial to the Vietnam War by the United States Navy as PACV patrol craft in the Mekong Delta where their mobility and speed was unique. This was used in both the UK SR.N5 curved deck configuration and later with modified <b>flat</b> <b>deck,</b> gun turret and grenade launcher designated the 9255 PACV. The United States Army also experimented {{with the use of}} SR.N5 hovercraft in Vietnam. Three hovercraft with the <b>flat</b> <b>deck</b> configuration were deployed to Đồng Tâm in the Mekong Delta region and later to Ben Luc. They saw action primarily in the Plain of Reeds. One was destroyed in early 1970 and another in August of that same year, after which the unit was disbanded. The only remaining U.S. Army SR.N5 hovercraft is currently on display in the Army Transport Museum in Virginia. Experience led to the proposed Bell SK-10, which was the basis for the LCAC-class air-cushioned landing craft now deployed by the U.S. and Japanese Navy. Developed and tested in the mid-1970s, the LACV-30 was used by the US Army to transport military cargo in logistics-over-the-shore operations from the early 1980s thru the mid 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Tranz Rail {{was accused}} of forcing freight onto the roads, and in 2002 {{introduced}} a containerisation scheme that assumed that most freight would be carried in containers on unit trains made up of fixed consists of <b>flat</b> <b>deck</b> wagons. Container loading depots were constructed at the major freight terminals. One of the reasons often cited for these policies was {{that the cost of}} using road transport to Tranz Rail was less than that of using rail, because the road infrastructure is provided as a public good, whereas the rail network was a private good.|$|E
25|$|For {{take-off}} {{of fixed}} wing aircraft, Admiral Kuznetsov uses a ski-jump {{at the end}} of her bow. On take-off aircraft accelerate toward and up the ski-jump using their afterburners. This results in the aircraft leaving the deck at a higher angle and elevation than on an aircraft carrier with a <b>flat</b> <b>deck</b> and catapults. The ski-jump take-off is less demanding on the pilot, since the acceleration is lower, but results in a clearance speed of only 120–140km/h (75–85mph) requiring an aircraft design which will not stall at those speeds.|$|E
25|$|The {{weight of}} the boiler rested on the water drums, and thus on {{supports}} from the firing <b>flat's</b> <b>deck.</b> The steam drum was only supported by the watertubes and was allowed to move freely, with thermal expansion. If superheated, the superheater elements were hung from this drum. Compared to the earlier Scotch and locomotive boilers, water-tube boilers with their reduced water volumes were considered lightweight and didn't require extensive supports.|$|R

2500|$|Barber's early {{designs were}} {{modified}} {{versions of the}} Queen Anne style, which Barber liked to enrich {{with the addition of}} Romanesque elements. [...] Barber houses constructed in this period are characterized by features such imposing turrets, projecting windows, verandas flanked by circular pavilions, and Syrian arches. [...] In {{the latter half of the}} 1890s, Barber began to offer more plans in the Colonial Revival style. [...] These were often characterized by projecting porticos supported by large columns, symmetrical facades, and <b>flat</b> <b>decks</b> with balustrades. Later Barber catalogs contained Bungalow and Craftsman styles, though few of these were built.|$|R
2500|$|Another of Coles's designs, , was {{completed}} in August 1864. Its existing broadside guns were replaced with four turrets on a <b>flat</b> <b>deck</b> and the ship was fitted with [...] of armour in a belt around the waterline. Early ships like Monitor and the Royal Sovereign had little sea-keeping qualities being limited to coastal waters. Coles, in collaboration with Sir Edward James Reed, went on to design and build HMS Monarch, the first seagoing warship to carry her guns in turrets. Laid down in 1866 and completed in June 1869, it carried two turrets, although {{the inclusion of a}} forecastle and poop prevented the guns firing fore and aft.|$|E
2500|$|The wugongchuan {{were built}} {{based on what}} the Chinese {{observed}} from Portuguese ships. The mid-Ming dynasty text Longjiang chuanchang zhi (龍江船廠志, Account of the Longjiang Shipyard) describes their observations as follows: [...] "The Portuguese ships had a length of ten zhang and a width of three zhang (approximately 36 × 11 meters). They had forty oars on each side, carried three to four guns, had a sharp-pointed keel and a <b>flat</b> <b>deck</b> and were thus safe against storms and high waves. Moreover, the crew was protected by breastwork and therefore had no need to fear arrows and stones. There were two hundred men altogether, with many pulling the oars, which made these ships very fast, even if there was no wind. When the guns were fired and the gun balls poured like rain, no enemy could resist. These ships were called wugongchuan." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{ferry boat}} {{was of a}} very {{singular}} construction, and most singular looking people they were who were on board of it. It had a great <b>flat</b> <b>deck,</b> which was of an oval form, and was spreading out very wide at the sides. There were seats {{here and there in}} different places, but no awning or shelter of any kind overhead. Rollo was glad of this, for the morning was so fine, and the view on every side was so magnificent, that he was very much pleased to have it so wholly unobstructed.|$|E

25|$|The basic hull {{design of}} Hamburg is a conventional, robust steel construction, with entirely <b>flat</b> <b>decks</b> amidship that slope {{slightly}} upwards towards the bow in {{a compromise between}} modern construction techniques and traditional design values.

5000|$|The {{invention}} of the seaplane in 1910 with the French Fabre Hydravion led to the earliest development of ships designed to carry airplanes, albeit equipped with floats. In 1911, the first such vessel appeared in the French Navy - [...] - she was the world's first seaplane carrier. She was commissioned as a seaplane tender, and carried float-equipped planes in hangars on the main deck, from where they were lowered on the sea with a crane.
