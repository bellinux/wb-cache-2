40|$|Background- This {{nationwide}} study {{sought to}} determine age- and gender-specific familial risks in siblings hospitalized for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Methods and Results- The Swedish Multigeneration Register on 0 - to 75 -year-old subjects {{was linked to the}} Hospital Discharge Register for the years 1987 - 2007. Standardized incidence ratios were calculated for individuals whose siblings were hospitalized for VTE compared with those whose siblings were not affected. Among a total of 45 362 hospitalized cases with VTE, 2393 affected siblings were identified, with a <b>familial</b> standardized <b>incidence</b> ratio of 2. 45 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 66 to 3. 61). Gender-specific differences in incidence rates were observed. The familial risks were significantly increased from the age of 10 to 69 years, with a <b>familial</b> standardized <b>incidence</b> ratio of 4. 77 (95 % CI, 1. 96 to 10. 83) at ages 10 to 19 years, which decreased to 2. 08 (95 % CI, 1. 35 to 3. 20) at ages 60 to 69 years, although the absolute risk increased with age. The <b>familial</b> standardized <b>incidence</b> ratios for siblings with 2 and ≥ 3 affected probands were 51. 87 (95 % CI, 31. 47 to 85. 00) and 53. 69 (95 % CI, 25. 59 to 108. 50), respectively. Spouses had low <b>familial</b> risks (standardized <b>incidence</b> ratio= 1. 07; 95 % CI, 1. 04 to 1. 10; observed spouse cases= 3900). Conclusions- Familial factors, although influenced by age and gender, are important risk factors for VTE. The present study shows that VTE is aggregated in families and suggests that uncovering the sources of familial aggregation (genetic and nongenetic) may be worthwhile. Moreover, in a small fraction of siblings, the familial risk was very high, suggesting segregation of rare but strong genetic risk factor...|$|R

We examined the risk of familial gastric cancer using the updated Swedish Family-Cancer Database with 5358 patients among offspring and 36 [*] 486 patients among parents. There were 133 families with one parent and one offspring diagnosed with gastric cancer, and 20 families with two affected offspring. <b>Familial</b> standardised <b>incidence</b> ratios (SIRs) were 1. 63 and 2. 93 when parents and siblings presented with gastric cancer, respectively.

40|$|Commonly used crude {{measures}} of disease risk or relative risk in a family, {{such as the}} presence/absence of disease {{or the number of}} affected relatives, do not take into account family structures and ages at disease oc-currence. The Family History Score incorporates these factors and has been used widely in epidemiology. How-ever, the Family History Score is not an estimate of familial relative risk; rather, it corresponds to a measure of statistical significance against a null hypothesis that the family’s disease risk is equal to that expected from reference rates. In this paper, the authors consider an estimate of familial relative risk using the empirical Bayes framework. The approach uses a two-level hierarchical model in which the first level models familial relative risk and the second considers a Poisson count of the number of affected relatives given the familial relative risk from the first level. The authors illustrate the utility of this methodology in a large, population-based case-control study of breast cancer, showing that, compared with commonly used summaries of family history including the Family History Score, the new estimates are more strongly associated with case-control status and more clearly detect effect modification of an environmental risk factor by familial relative risk.

40|$|Abstract The Swedish Family-Cancer Database {{has been}} used for almost 10 years in the study of {{familial}} risks at all common sites. In the present paper we describe some main features of version VI of this Database, assembled in 2004. This update included all Swedes born in 1932 and later (offspring) with their biological parents, a total of 10. 5 million individuals. Cancer cases were retrieved from the Swedish Cancer Registry from 1958 - 2002, including over 1. 2 million first and multiple primary cancers and in situ tumours. Compared to previous versions, only 6. 0 % of deceased offspring with a cancer diagnosis lack any parental information. We show one application of the Database in the study of familial risks in colorectal adenocarcinoma, with defined age-group and anatomic site specific analyses. <b>Familial</b> standardized <b>incidence</b> ratios (SIRs) were determined for offspring when parents or sibling were diagnosed with colon or rectal cancer. As a novel finding it was shown that risks for siblings were higher than those for offspring of affected parents. The excess risk was limited to colon cancer and particularly to right-sided colon cancer. The SIRs for colon cancer in age matched populations were 2. 58 when parents were probands and 3. 81 when siblings were probands; for right-sided colon cancer the SIRs were 3. 66 and 7. 53, respectively. Thus the familial excess (SIR- 1. 00) was more than two fold higher for right-sided colon cancer. Colon and rectal cancers appeared to be distinguished between high-penetrant and recessive conditions that only affect the colon, whereas low-penetrant familial effects are shared by the two sites. Epidemiological studies can be used to generate clinical estimates for familial risk, conditioned on numbers of affected family members and their ages of onset. Useful risk estimates have been developed for familial breast and prostate cancers. Reliable risk estimates for other cancers should also be seriously considered for routine clinical recommendations, because practically all cancers show a familial effect and the risks are high for some of the rare neoplasms. The implementation of a unified management plan for familial cancers at large will be a major challenge to the clinical genetic counselling community. </p...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Familial {{hypercholesterolemia}} {{is characterized}} by high plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and premature coronary heart disease. Despite the monogenetic origin of <b>familial</b> hypercholesterolemia, the <b>incidence</b> of coronary heart disease varies considerably among patients, which is only partly explained by classical risk factors. Hypertension is an important risk factor for coronary heart disease {{that is associated with}} angiotensinogen levels. Therefore, we analyzed the angiotensinogen gene as a modifier gene for coronary heart disease risk in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. METHODS: In a cohort of 1785 familial hypercholesterolemia patients, we reconstructed five frequent haplotypes of the angiotensinogen gene, based on four polymorphisms. The five haplotypes cover approximately 98 % of the genetic diversity accounted for by these four polymorphisms. The associations between the haplotypes and coronary heart disease were analyzed with the haplo. stats program, adjusted for age, sex and smoking. RESULTS: Patients homozygous for the C allele of the 4072 T>C polymorphism had a 34 % increased coronary heart disease risk (P = 0. 017) compared to patients homozygous for the T allele. Haplotype H 3, consisting of the minor allele of the 4072 T>C polymorphism and the major alleles of the other polymorphisms, had a frequency of 15 % and was associated with a 45 % increased coronary heart disease risk (P = 0. 006) compared to the wild-type haplotype H 1.

40|$|Aneurysm of the {{abdominal}} aorta (AAA) is multifactorial disease related to acquired factors (arteriosclerosis) and genetic factors (collagen anomalies) with, in some cases, a <b>familial</b> component. The <b>incidence</b> of <b>familial</b> AAA was evaluated in 324 patients in 313 families who underwent surgery for AAA. A family survey {{was used to}} determine whether members of the operated patients had AAA or had died due to ruptured aneurysms. There were 276 cases (including 12 females) with sporadic AAA and 81 cases (including 5 females) who were members of families with at least one other member having AAA. Comparison between sporadic AAA (SAAA) and familial AAA (FAAA) demonstrated the following differences: 1) diagnosis was made earlier in FAAA (p < 0. 05) than in SAAA (64. 1 versus 66 years of age respectively), 2) patients with FAAA were younger at the time of rupture (65. 4 versus 75. 1 years, p < 0. 001), 3) the incidence of rupture was greater in FAAA than in SAAA (32. 4 % versus 8. 7 % p < 0. 001), and finally 4) the relative risk of developing AAA was 18 times greater in members of a family with AAA than in the reference population.

This study aims to determine the familial risks of glomerulonephritis. Methods: Individuals born from 1932 onwards diagnosed with glomerulonephritis (acute [n = 7011], chronic [n = 10, 242] and unspecified glomerulonephritis [n = 5762]) were included. The <b>familial</b> risk (Standardized <b>incidence</b> ratio = SIR) was calculated for individuals whose parents/full-siblings were diagnosed with glomerulonephritis compared to those whose parents/full-siblings were not. The procedure was repeated for spouses. Familial concordant risk (same disease in proband and exposed relative) and discordant risk (different disease in proband and exposed relative) of glomerulonephritis were determined. Results: Familial concordant risks (parents/full-sibling history) were: SIR = 3. 57 (95 % confidence interval, 2. 77 – 4. 53) for acute glomerulonephritis, SIR = 3. 84 (3. 37 – 4. 36) for chronic glomerulonephritis and SIR = 3. 75 (2. 85 – 4. 83) for unspecified glomerulonephritis. High familial risks were observed if two or more relatives were affected; the SIR was 209. 83 (150. 51 – 284. 87) in individuals {{with at least one}} affected parent as well as one full-sibling. The spouse risk was only moderately increased (SIR = 1. 53, 1. 33 – 1. 75). Conclusions: Family history of glomerulonephritis is a strong predictor for glomerulonephritis, and is a potentially useful tool in clinical risk assessment. Our data emphasize the contribution of familial factors to the glomerulonephritis burden in the community. Key messagesThe familial risks (full-sibling/parent history) of glomerulonephritis (acute, chronic and unspecified glomerulonephritis) have not been determined previously.

This nationwide study aimed to determine whether VTE shares familial susceptibility with VVs. Methods and Results-—Swedish Multigeneration Register data for persons aged 0 to 76 years during the period 1964 – 2008 were linked to the Swedish Inpatient and Outpatient Registers. <b>Familial</b> risks (standardized <b>incidence</b> ratios [SIRs]) of VTE and VVs were examined in 2 ways (ie, bidirectionally) : risk of VTE in subjects whose siblings had been diagnosed with VVs and risk of VVs in persons whose siblings had been diagnosed with VTE. The analyses were repeated for spouses to determine the importance of shared adult family environment. In total, 96 810 siblings had VVs and 87 564 had VTE. An increased risk of VTE was observed in persons whose siblings had VVs (SIR 1. 30, 95 % CI 1. 26 to 1. 33), whereas persons whose siblings had VTE had an increased risk of VVs (SIR 1. 30, 95 % CI 1. 27 to 1. 34). If 2 or more siblings were affected by VTE, the risk for VVs was 1. 70 (95 % CI 1. 53 to 1. 88). Conversely, if 2 or more siblings were affected by VVs, the risk for VTE was 1. 52 (95 % CI 1. 38 to 1. 67). In spouses of VTE patients, a minor increased risk of VVs was observed (SIR 1. 05 for husbands, SIR 1. 06 for wives). The risk of VTE in spouses of VV patients was similarly small (SIR 1. 01 for husbands, SIR 1. 05 for wives). Conclusions-—VVs and VTE share familial susceptibility.

40|$|Abstract Background Parkinson's {{disease is}} a {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disorder, where most cases are sporadic with a late onset. In rare <b>incidences</b> <b>familial</b> forms of early-onset parkinsonism occur, and when recessively inherited, cases are often explained by mutations in either the parkin (PARK 2) or PINK 1 (PARK 6) gene or on exceptional occasions the DJ- 1 (PARK 7) or ATP 13 A 2 (PARK 9) gene. Recessively inherited deletions/duplications and point mutations in the parkin gene {{are the most common}} cause of early-onset parkinsonism known so far, but in an increasing number of studies, genetic variations in the serine/threonine kinase domain of the PINK 1 gene are found to explain early-onset parkinsonism. Methods In this study all families were from a population with a high incidence of consanguinity. We investigated 11 consanguineous families comprising 17 affected with recessively inherited young-onset parkinsonism for mutations both in the parkin and PINK 1 gene. Exons and flanking regions were sequenced, and segregation patterns of genetic variation were assessed in members of the respective families. An exon dosage analysis was performed for all exons in both genes. Results In the parkin gene, a three generation family was identified with an exon 4 deletion segregating with disease. Both affected were homozygous for the deletion that segregated on a haplotype that spanned the gene in a haplotype segregation analysis that was performed using additional markers. Exon dosage analysis confirmed the recessive pattern of inheritance with heterozygous deletions segregating in healthy family members. In the PINK 1 gene we identified two novel putative pathogenic substitutions, P 416 R and S 419 P, located in a conserved motif of the serine/threonine kinase domain. Both substitutions segregated with disease in agreement with a recessive pattern of inheritance within respective families and both were present as homozygous in two affected each. We also discuss common polymorphisms in the two genes found to be co-segregating within families. Conclusion Our results further extend on the involvement of PINK 1 mutations in recessive early-onset parkinsonism with clinical features similar to carriers of parkin mutations. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurpose: Studies {{have shown}} that 11 % to 18 % of {{patients}} with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) have a first-degree relative with an AAA. A familial pattern among patients with peripheral arterial aneurysms and arteriomegaly has not been reported. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine familial patterns among patients with peripheral arterial aneurysm and arteriomegaly and compare them with patterns among patients with AAA. Methods: Pedigrees were constructed for first-degree relatives of patients who received the diagnosis of peripheral arterial aneurysm, arteriomegaly, or AAA from 1988 through 1996. The presence of aneurysms and risk factors was confirmed for patients and relatives by means of telephone interviews and review of hospital and physician records. Results: Seven hundred three first-degree relatives older than 50 years were contacted for 140 probands with peripheral arterial aneurysm, AAA, or arteriomegaly. There were differences in risk factors for hernia and diabetes mellitus among the probands with peripheral arterial aneurysm, AAA, or arteriomegaly but none for relatives. Patients with peripheral arterial aneurysm (n = 40) had a 10 % (4 / 40) <b>familial</b> <b>incidence</b> rate of an aneurysm, patients with AAA (n = 86) had a 22 % (19 / 86) <b>familial</b> <b>incidence</b> rate, and patients with arteriomegaly (n = 14) had a 36 % (5 / 14) <b>familial</b> <b>incidence</b> rate. AAA (24 / 28, or 86 %) was the aneurysm diagnosed most commonly among first-degree relatives. Most aneurysms (85 %) occurred among men. Conclusion: There appears to be a gradation of familial patterns from peripheral arterial aneurysm to AAA to arteriomegaly among patients with degenerative aneurysmal disease, and there appears to be a predominance among men. Relatives of patients with any of the 3 lesions—peripheral arterial aneurysm, AAA, arteriomegaly—most frequently have AAA. Relatives of patients with AAA, peripheral arterial aneurysm, or arteriomegaly may be screened by means of a physical examination for peripheral aneurysmal disease. Screening by means of ultrasound examination of the aorta should be limited to first-degree relatives of patients with aortic aneurysms or arteriomegaly. (J Vasc Surg 1998; 28 : 599 - 605. ...|$|E

40|$|Primary ovarian {{insufficiency}} (POI) {{is characterized}} by amenorrhea in association with postmenopausal follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels in women younger than 40 years. POI affects 1 % of women and greatly influences a woman’s fertility potential and her overall health. The exact cause of POI remains to be elucidated in most women. In 2004, the Dutch POI consortium was established. This national collaboration is aimed at unraveling the genetic components of POI and to further describe the phenotype of women affected by POI. This thesis presents results from the ongoing research activities of the national POI collaboration. POI is nowadays regarded as a complex genetic trait. Through the common disease - common variant approach, research {{is focused on the}} identification of important new genes and non-coding alleles involved in gene expression modulation. It is of utmost importance to include a homogeneous and well-phenotyped population in this type of study. We demonstrated that women with <b>familial</b> POI (<b>incidence</b> of 29 %) have no distinctive phenotype characteristics than women with sporadic POI, and conclude that familial background of POI does not necessitate a different genetic approach. Meanwhile, researches worldwide have always focused on the possibility that specific single gene mutations could explain a considerable proportion of POI, especially in familial cases. One of these candidate genes is NR 5 A 1. In contrast to previous findings of a mutation frequency of 8 % of NR 5 A 1 in women with POI, we found an overall mutation rate of only 1. 4 %. NR 5 A 1 can therefore not be considered as a major contributor to the presence of POI. Similarly, FMR 1 premutations and intermediate-sized CGG repeat alleles were previously found to contribute to POI in up to 13 %. In our POI cohort only 1. 7 % of women were FMR 1 premutation carriers. Moreover, measures of POI severity did not significantly depend on CGG repeat numbers, which emphasizes that normal and intermediate FMR 1 CGG repeat sizes do not {{play a central role in}} POI. While hypoestrogenemia in women with POI and the probably associated effects have been fairly well documented, the role of androgens remains to be determined. Our systematic review and meta-analysis showed that women with POI have significantly decreased total testosterone concentrations in comparison with female controls. A complicating factor in this matter is that androgen measurement in female samples is problematic due to trueness and precision problems. We assessed that, compared with a labor-intensive extraction radioimmunoassay, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry is a reliable, fast alternative for measuring androgen hormones in women. Women about to undergo gonadotoxic treatment are increasingly seeking medical help for fertility preservation. Fifteen children have now been born following ovarian cryopreservation and subsequent autotransplantation. The question remains whether this still experimental technique is sufficiently successful (possible publication bias) to offer to women about to undergo gonadotoxic treatment. We identified that ovarian reserve parameters such as AMH and inhibin B, are very low following this procedure, which indicates a low ovarian reserve status. This explains the poor pregnancy rate, and we therefore conclude that this method is not very successful...|$|R
40|$|Background: Parkinson's {{disease is}} a {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disorder, where most cases are sporadic with a late onset. In rare <b>incidences</b> <b>familial</b> forms of early-onset parkinsonism occur, and when recessively inherited, cases are often explained by mutations in either the parkin (PARK 2) or PINK 1 (PARK 6) gene or on exceptional occasions the DJ- 1 (PARK 7) or ATP 13 A 2 (PARK 9) gene. Recessively inherited deletions/duplications and point mutations in the parkin gene {{are the most common}} cause of early-onset parkinsonism known so far, but in an increasing number of studies, genetic variations in the serine/threonine kinase domain of the PINK 1 gene are found to explain early-onset parkinsonism. Methods: In this study all families were from a population with a high incidence of consanguinity. We investigated 11 consanguineous families comprising 17 affected with recessively inherited young-onset parkinsonism for mutations both in the parkin and PINK 1 gene. Exons and flanking regions were sequenced, and segregation patterns of genetic variation were assessed in members of the respective families. An exon dosage analysis was performed for all exons in both genes. Results: In the parkin gene, a three generation family was identified with an exon 4 deletion segregating with disease. Both affected were homozygous for the deletion that segregated on a haplotype that spanned the gene in a haplotype segregation analysis that was performed using additional markers. Exon dosage analysis confirmed the recessive pattern of inheritance with heterozygous deletions segregating in healthy family members. In the PINK 1 gene we identified two novel putative pathogenic substitutions, P 416 R and S 419 P, located in a conserved motif of the serine/threonine kinase domain. Both substitutions segregated with disease in agreement with a recessive pattern of inheritance within respective families and both were present as homozygous in two affected each. We also discuss common polymorphisms in the two genes found to be co-segregating within families. Conclusion: Our results further extend on the involvement of PINK 1 mutations in recessive early-onset parkinsonism with clinical features similar to carriers of parkin mutations. © 2008 Myhre et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed to {{characterize}} the distribution of colorectal cancer risk using family history of cancers by data mining. Family histories for 10, 066 colorectal cancer cases recruited to population cancer registries of the Colon Cancer Family Registry were analyzed using a data mining framework. A novel index was developed to quantify familial cancer aggregation. Artificial neural network was used to identify distinct categories of <b>familial</b> risk. Standardized <b>incidence</b> ratios (SIRs) and corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) of colorectal cancer were calculated for each category. We identified five major, and 66 minor categories of familial risk for developing colorectal cancer. The distribution the major risk categories were: (1) 7 % of families (SIR = 7. 11; 95 % CI 6. 65 - 7. 59) had a strong family history of colorectal cancer; (2) 13 % of families (SIR = 2. 94; 95 % CI 2. 78 - 3. 10) had a moderate family history of colorectal cancer; (3) 11 % of families (SIR = 1. 23; 95 % CI 1. 12 - 1. 36) had a strong family history of breast cancer and a weak family history of colorectal cancer; (4) 9 % of families (SIR = 1. 06; 95 % CI 0. 96 - 1. 18) had strong family history of prostate cancer and weak family history of colorectal cancer; and (5) 60 % of families (SIR = 0. 61; 95 % CI 0. 57 - 0. 65) had a weak family history of all cancers. There is a wide variation of colorectal cancer risk that can be categorized by family history of cancer, with a strong gradient of colorectal cancer risk between the highest and lowest risk categories. The risk of colorectal cancer for people with the highest risk category of family history (7 % of the population) was 12 -times that {{for people in the}} lowest risk category (60 %) of the population. Data mining was proven an effective approach for gaining insight into the underlying cancer aggregation patterns and for categorizing familial risk of colorectal cancer.
