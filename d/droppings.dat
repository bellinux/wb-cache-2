5|$|Starlings' <b>droppings</b> {{can contain}} the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum, {{the cause of}} {{histoplasmosis}} in humans. At roosting sites this fungus can thrive in accumulated <b>droppings.</b> There {{are a number of}} other infectious diseases that can potentially be transmitted by common starlings to humans, although the potential for the birds to spread infections may have been exaggerated.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} (as at 2010) of two breeding {{pairs of}} wild peregrine falcons (nesting {{one in each}} of the telescope's two support towers) prevents the nuisance of pigeon infestation (by <b>droppings</b> fouling, and their body heat affecting sensitive instrument readings) that some other radio telescopes suffer from.|$|E
5|$|The {{tree sparrow}} {{is seen as}} a pest in some areas. In Australia, it damages many cereal and fruit crops and spoils cereal crops, animal feed and stored grain with its <b>droppings.</b> Quarantine rules {{prohibit}} the transport of this species into Western Australia.|$|E
5|$|A {{nematode}} (Myrmeconema neotropicum) that infects canopy ants (Cephalotes atratus) {{causes the}} black-coloured gasters of workers to turn red. The parasite also alters the behaviour of the ant, {{causing them to}} carry their gasters high. The conspicuous red gasters are mistaken by birds for ripe fruits, such as Hyeronima alchorneoides, and eaten. The <b>droppings</b> of the bird are collected by other ants and fed to their young, leading to further spread of the nematode.|$|E
5|$|Beginning at the post–World War I 1920 Summer Olympics, the {{lighting}} of the Olympic Flame {{was followed by}} the release of doves, symbolizing peace. (Experienced athletes brought newspapers to cover themselves because of the birds' <b>droppings.)</b> The release was discontinued after several doves perched themselves at the cauldron's rim and were burned alive in the Olympic Flame during the opening ceremony of the 1988 Summer Olympics. It was later replaced with a symbolic release of doves after the flame has been lit.|$|E
5|$|Brazilian pepper (Schinus terebinthifolius) {{was brought}} to Southern Florida as an {{ornamental}} shrub and was dispersed by the <b>droppings</b> of birds and other animals that ate its bright red berries. It thrives on abandoned agricultural land growing in forests too dense for wading birds to nest in, similar to melaleucas. It grows rapidly especially after hurricanes and has invaded pineland forests. Following Hurricane Andrew, scientists and volunteers cleared damaged pinelands of Brazilian pepper so the native trees {{would be able to}} return to their natural state.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage is an {{important}} defense strategy enabled by changes in body shape, colour and markings. Some lepidopterans blend with the surroundings, making them difficult to be spotted by predators. Caterpillars can be shades of green that match their host plant. Others resemble inedible objects, such as twigs or leaves. The larvae of some species, such as the common Mormon and the western tiger swallowtail look like bird <b>droppings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Huge urban roosts {{in cities}} can create {{problems}} {{due to the}} noise and mess made {{and the smell of}} the <b>droppings.</b> In 1949, so many birds landed on the clock hands of London's Big Ben that it stopped, leading to unsuccessful attempts to disrupt the roosts with netting, repellent chemical on the ledges and broadcasts of common starling alarm calls. An entire episode of The Goon Show in 1954 was a parody of the futile efforts to disrupt the large common starling roosts in central London.|$|E
5|$|In 1997 an {{outbreak}} of respiratory disease occurred in Malaysian farmers and their pigs. More than 265 cases of encephalitis, of which 105 were fatal, were recorded. A new paramyxovirus was discovered in a victim's brain; it was named Nipah virus, after the village where he had lived. The infection {{was caused by a}} virus from fruit bats, after their colony had been disrupted by deforestation. The bats had moved to trees nearer the pig farm and the pigs caught the virus from their <b>droppings.</b>|$|E
5|$|It {{was once}} {{suggested}} {{that the relationship between}} the obligate and regular ant-followers and the army ants, particularly Eciton burchellii, was mutualistic, with the ants benefiting by having the birds chase prey back down towards them. However, experiments where ant followers were excluded have shown that the foraging success of the army ants was 30% lower when the birds were present, suggesting that the birds' relationship was in fact parasitic. This has resulted in a number of behaviours by the ants in order to reduce kleptoparasitism, including hiding of secured prey in the leaf litter and caching of food on trails. It has been {{suggested that the}} depressive effect of this parasitism slows the development of E. burchellii swarms and in turn benefits other ant species which are preyed upon by army ants. The ant-following antbirds are themselves followed by three species of butterfly in the family Ithomiinae which feed on their <b>droppings.</b> Bird <b>droppings</b> are usually an unpredictable resource in a rainforest, but the regular behaviour of ant followers makes the exploitation of this resource possible.|$|E
5|$|The Nauruan economy {{peaked in}} the early 1980s, as it was {{dependent}} almost entirely on the phosphate deposits that originate from the <b>droppings</b> of sea birds. There are few other resources, and most necessities are imported. Small-scale mining is still conducted by RONPhos, {{formerly known as the}} Nauru Phosphate Corporation. The government places a percentage of RONPhos's earnings into the Nauru Phosphate Royalties Trust. The Trust manages long-term investments, which were intended to support the citizens once the phosphate reserves were exhausted.|$|E
5|$|The {{black vulture}} is {{considered}} a threat by cattle ranchers due to its predation on newborn cattle. The <b>droppings</b> produced by black vultures and other vultures can harm or kill trees and other vegetation. The bird is also considered {{a threat to the}} safety of aerial traffic, especially when it congregates in large numbers in the vicinity of garbage dumps—as is the case in the Rio de Janeiro Tom Jobim International Airport.|$|E
5|$|The coyote {{feeds on}} a variety of {{different}} produce, including blackberries, blueberries, peaches, pears, apples, prickly pears, chapotes, persimmons, peanuts, watermelons, cantaloupes, and carrots. During the winter and early spring, the coyote eats large quantities of grass, such as green wheat blades. It sometimes eats unusual items such as cotton cake, soybean meal, domestic animal <b>droppings,</b> beans, and cultivated grain such as corn, wheat, and sorghum.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} {{investigation of}} fertilization {{began at the}} Rothamsted Experimental Station in 1843 by John Bennet Lawes. He investigated the impact of inorganic and organic fertilizers on crop yield and founded {{one of the first}} artificial fertilizer manufacturing factories in 1842. Fertilizer, in the shape of sodium nitrate deposits in Chile, was imported to Britain by John Thomas North as well as guano (birds <b>droppings).</b> The first commercial process for fertilizer production was the obtaining of phosphate from the dissolution of coprolites in sulphuric acid.|$|E
5|$|The square {{was once}} famous for feral pigeons and feeding {{them was a}} popular activity. Pigeons began {{flocking}} to the square before construction was completed and feed sellers became {{well known in the}} Victorian era. The desirability of the birds' presence was contentious: their <b>droppings</b> disfigured the stonework and the flock, estimated at its peak to be 35,000, was considered a health hazard. A stall seller, Bernie Rayner, infamously sold bird seed to tourists at inflated prices.|$|E
5|$|Although Kapoor {{does not}} draw with {{computer}}s, computer modeling {{was essential to}} the process of analyzing the complex form, which created numerous issues. Since the sculpture was expected to be outdoors, concerns arose that it might retain and conduct heat {{in a way that would}} make it too hot to touch during the summer and so cold that one's tongue might stick to it during the winter. The extreme temperature variation between seasons was also feared to weaken the structure. Graffiti, bird <b>droppings</b> and fingerprints were also potential problems, as they would affect the aesthetics of the surface. The most pressing issue was the need to create a single seamless exterior for the external shell, a feat architect Norman Foster once believed to be nearly impossible.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage {{is found}} in many butterflies. Some like the oakleaf {{butterfly}} and autumn leaf are remarkable imitations of leaves. As caterpillars, many defend themselves by freezing and appearing like sticks or branches. Others have deimatic behaviours, such as rearing up and waving their front ends which are marked with eyespots {{as if they were}} snakes. Some papilionid caterpillars such as the giant swallowtail (Papilio cresphontes) resemble bird <b>droppings.</b> Some caterpillars have hairs and bristly structures that provide protection while others are gregarious and form dense aggregations. Some species are myrmecophiles, forming mutualistic associations with ants and gaining their protection. Behavioural defences include perching and angling the wings to reduce shadow and avoid being conspicuous. Some female Nymphalid butterflies guard their eggs from parasitoidal wasps.|$|E
5|$|Common {{starlings}} can eat {{and damage}} fruit in orchards such as grapes, peaches, olives, currants and tomatoes or dig up newly sown grain and sprouting crops. They may also eat animal feed and distribute seeds through their <b>droppings.</b> In eastern Australia, weeds like bridal creeper, blackberry and boneseed {{are thought to}} have been spread by common starlings. Agricultural damage in the US is estimated as costing about US$800 million annually. This bird is not considered to be as damaging to agriculture in South Africa {{as it is in the}} United States.|$|E
5|$|Fare {{control is}} in a glass-enclosed headhouse {{building}} off of Main Street. The headhouse has {{a feature that}} is unusual to the subway system: it uses recordings of birds to try to scare away city pigeons, and these bird recordings play every few minutes or so. The system was installed because of issues with pigeons entering the headhouse and leaving feathers and <b>droppings</b> both inside and around the building. Previous efforts, like spiked ledges, had been ineffective in curbing the pigeon population of the area immediately next to the station.|$|E
5|$|In February 2001, {{the sale}} of bird seed in the square was stopped and other {{measures}} were introduced to discourage the pigeons {{including the use of}} birds of prey. Supporters continued to feed the birds but in 2003 the mayor, Ken Livingstone, enacted bylaws to ban feeding them in the square. In September 2007 Westminster City Council passed further bylaws banning feeding birds on the pedestrianised North Terrace and other pavements in the area. Nelson's column was repaired from years of damage from pigeon <b>droppings</b> at a cost of £140,000.|$|E
5|$|In July 2008, the Amami Rangers {{for nature}} {{conservation}} obtained {{a photograph of}} a feral cat carrying a rabbit corpse (rabbit bones and fur found in cat or dog <b>droppings</b> had already been found), prompting discussions on better ways to control pets. A small area of the Amami Island has the Amami Gunto Quasi-National Park that further protects the population. Some attempt at habitat restoration has been made, but the Amami rabbit needs a mosaic of mature and young forest in close proximity, and when a young forest is regrown nowhere near a mature forest, this rabbit is not likely to inhabit it. Research and population monitoring also is underway to try to keep the numbers from declining, even if they can not be increased.|$|E
5|$|Mangroves {{also serve}} as {{excellent}} rookeries for birds. Wading birds, such as roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja), egrets, and tricolored herons (Egretta tricolor) use the mangroves as a nursery, due to the proximity of food sources and the protection offered from most prey. Thousands of birds can nest in the mangroves at once, making a noisy and messy colony, but their <b>droppings</b> fertilize the mangrove trees. Shorebirds like rails, terns and gulls; diving birds such as pelicans and grebes; and birds of prey such as ospreys, hawks and vultures are {{among the more than}} 100 species of birds that use Everglades mangrove trees to raise their young.|$|E
5|$|Quolls are {{carnivorous}} marsupials. They {{are primarily}} nocturnal, sleeping in hollowed-out logs or rocky dens and {{coming out to}} hunt during the night, though on rare occasions they can be seen looking for prey during the day. They are mostly ground-dwelling, {{but it is not}} uncommon to see a quoll climbing a tree. Quolls mark their territory several kilometres away from their dens. A male's territory often overlaps many females' territories, and male and female quolls only meet for mating. Quolls have communal toilet areas, usually on an outcropping used for marking territory and social functions. These communal latrines may have up to 100 <b>droppings</b> in them.|$|E
5|$|The fruits {{produced}} by cacti after the flowers have been fertilized vary considerably; many are fleshy, although some are dry. All contain {{a large number}} of seeds. Fleshy, colorful and sweet-tasting fruits are associated with seed dispersal by birds. The seeds pass through their digestive systems and are deposited in their <b>droppings.</b> Fruit that falls to the ground may be eaten by other animals; giant tortoises are reported to distribute Opuntia seeds in the Galápagos Islands. Ants appear to disperse the seeds of a few genera, such as Blossfeldia. Drier spiny fruits may cling to the fur of mammals or be moved around by the wind.|$|E
5|$|The {{wedding is}} deemed not in {{accordance}} to Hindu rituals. Banai and Khandoba marry in a simple, un-Brahmanical ceremony, where sheep <b>droppings</b> are showered on the couple, instead of rice as in the ritualistic weddings of classical (Brahmanical) Hinduism. The wedding is conducted without a Brahmin officiating priest. Shepherds read the mantras (the responsibility of the Brahmin in a normal wedding) and the bleating of sheep replaces the traditional wedding band. The wedding is sometimes described as a gandharva marriage. Due to the unceremonious nature of the wedding, she is sometimes considered as a rakh (concubine) of Khandoba.|$|E
5|$|Though {{they were}} {{documented}} by <b>droppings</b> and tracks, {{pictures of the}} Bornean rhinoceros were first taken and widely distributed by modern conservationists in April 2006, when camera traps photographed a healthy adult in the jungles of Sabah in Malaysian Borneo. On 24 April 2007, {{it was announced that}} cameras had captured the first-ever video footage of a wild Bornean rhino. The night-time footage showed the rhino eating, peering through jungle foliage, and sniffing the film equipment. The World Wildlife Fund, which took the video, has used it in efforts to convince local governments to turn the area into a rhino conservation zone. Monitoring has continued; 50 new cameras have been set up, and in February 2010, {{what appeared to be a}} pregnant rhino was filmed.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of plant {{material}} is also consumed, including the fruit or berries of Ficus species, Leucopogon species, Exocarpos species, a cycad Macrozamia riedlei, a mistletoe Lysiana exocarpi, Astroloma humifusum, A.pinifolium, Myoporum insulare, Enchylaena tomentosa and Coprosma quadrifida. The grey currawong also eats berries of introduced plants such as Pyracantha angustifolia and P.fortuneana, and Cotoneaster species, and crops such as maize, apples, pears, quince, various stone fruit of the genus Prunus, grapes, tomato, passion flowers, and the nectar of gymea lily (Doryanthes excelsa). On Kangaroo Island, the grey currawong {{has been identified as}} the main vector for the spread of bridal creeper (Asparagus asparagoides). Boneseed (Chrysanthemoides monilifera subspecies monilifera), another invasive species readily dispersed in bird <b>droppings,</b> is also consumed by grey currawongs. In Tasmania, A.pinifolium is especially popular, and one observer noted that the normally noisy birds became quiet and sluggish after eating it, prompting him to wonder whether the plant had a narcotic effect on the birds.|$|E
5|$|Another area {{of concern}} is California, where {{recovery}} began to fluctuate or decline in the late 1990s. Unusually high mortality rates amongst adult and subadult otters, particularly females, have been reported. In 2017 the US Geological Survey found a 3% drop in the sea otter population of the California coast. This number still keeps them on track for removal from the endangered species list, although just barely. Necropsies of dead sea otters indicate diseases, particularly Toxoplasma gondii and acanthocephalan parasite infections, are major causes of sea otter mortality in California. The Toxoplasma gondii parasite, which is often fatal to sea otters, is carried by wild and domestic cats and may be transmitted by domestic cat <b>droppings</b> flushed into the ocean via sewage systems. Although disease has clearly contributed {{to the deaths of}} many of California's sea otters, it is not known why the California population is apparently more affected by disease than populations in other areas.|$|E
5|$|Cryptothecia rubrocincta {{is easily}} {{recognized}} by the bright red pigment in the thallus. The pigment, first isolated from the species by Hesse in 1904, is called chiodectonic acid. The lichen also contains the colorless depside compound confluentinic acid. A 2005 study employed the technique Raman spectroscopy to determine the chemical composition of the differently colored zones. The white crystalline zone contains calcium oxalate dihydrate, or weddellite, a chemical substance found in other lichens and extremophiles growing on calcium-rich surfaces. Some {{have suggested that the}} calcium oxalate serves in the organism's survival strategy: the storage of water as a crystalline hydrate is essential for periods of drought in desiccated environments, and calcium oxalate has been identified as dissuading herbivores. Because the lichen grows on calcium-poor surfaces, calcium ions are thought to be acquired from rain, bird <b>droppings,</b> and airborne particles.|$|E
5|$|In the {{developed}} world, {{the majority of}} the poultry reared for meat is raised indoors in big sheds, with automated equipment under environmentally controlled conditions. Chickens raised in this way are known as broilers, and genetic improvements have meant that they can be grown to slaughter weight within six or seven weeks of hatching. Newly hatched chicks are restricted to a small area and given supplementary heating. Litter on the floor absorbs the <b>droppings</b> and the area occupied is expanded as they grow. Feed and water is supplied automatically and the lighting is controlled. The birds may be harvested on several occasions or the whole shed may be cleared at one time. A similar rearing system is usually used for turkeys, which are less hardy than chickens, but they take longer to grow and are often moved on to separate fattening units to finish. Ducks are particularly popular in Asia and Australia and can be killed at seven weeks under commercial conditions.|$|E
5|$|Of vertebrates, {{numerous}} {{species of}} frog, salamander, snake, turtle, and alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) proliferate in marsh waters. Most {{of these animals}} are active at night. Frog choruses are overwhelming; during alligator mating season the grunts of bulls join in. The marshes around the St. Johns River upper basin teem with birds. A recent study counted 60,000 birds in one month, nesting or feeding in the upper basin. Wading and water birds like the white ibis (Eudocimus albus), wood stork (Mycteria americana), and purple gallinule (Porphyrio martinicus) depend on the water for raising their young: they prey upon small fish and tadpoles in shallow water and puddles in the dry season. In successful seasons, their colonies can number in the thousands, creating a cacophony of calls and fertilizing trees with their <b>droppings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Other seeds, such as apple pips and plum stones, have fleshy {{receptacles}} {{and smaller}} fruits like hawthorns have seeds enclosed in edible tissue; animals including mammals and birds eat the fruits and either discard the seeds, or swallow {{them so they}} pass through the gut to be deposited in the animal's <b>droppings</b> {{well away from the}} parent tree. The germination of some seeds is improved when they are processed in this way. Nuts may be gathered by animals such as squirrels that cache any not immediately consumed. Many of these caches are never revisited, the nut-casing softens with rain and frost, and the seed germinates in the spring. Pine cones may similarly be hoarded by red squirrels, and grizzly bears may help to disperse the seed by raiding squirrel caches.|$|E
5|$|Sheepskin is {{likewise}} used for making clothes, footwear, rugs, and other products. Byproducts from {{the slaughter of}} sheep are also of value: sheep tallow {{can be used in}} candle and soap making, sheep bone and cartilage has been used to furnish carved items such as dice and buttons as well as rendered glue and gelatin. Sheep intestine can be formed into sausage casings, and lamb intestine has been formed into surgical sutures, as well as strings for musical instruments and tennis rackets. Sheep <b>droppings,</b> which are high in cellulose, have even been sterilized and mixed with traditional pulp materials to make paper. Of all sheep byproducts, perhaps the most valuable is lanolin: the waterproof, fatty substance found naturally in sheep's wool and used as a base for innumerable cosmetics and other products.|$|E
5|$|Species {{that are}} morphologically {{similar to the}} broad-billed parrot, such as the {{hyacinth}} macaw and the palm cockatoo, may provide insight into its ecology. Anodorhynchus macaws, which are habitual ground dwellers, eat very hard palm nuts. Carlos Yamashita has suggested that these macaws once depended on now-extinct South American megafauna to eat fruits and excrete the seeds, and that they later relied on domesticated cattle to do this. Similarly, in Australasia the palm cockatoo feeds on undigested seeds from cassowary <b>droppings.</b> Yamashita suggested that the abundant Cylindraspis tortoises and dodos performed the same function on Mauritius, and that the broad-billed parrot, with its macaw-like beak, depended on them to obtain cleaned seeds. Many types of palms and palm-like plants on Mauritius produce hard seeds that the broad-billed parrot may have eaten, including Latania loddigesii, Mimusops maxima, Sideroxylon grandiflorum, Diospyros egrettorium, and Pandanus utilis.|$|E
5|$|The {{antelope}} is shy and elusive. When alarmed, {{it stands}} motionless and may nervously leap {{away from the}} danger or even sprint. It often conceals itself in tall grasses to escape predators. The use of alarm calls to alert others is not common because the antelope tries to avoid the attention of predators. However, in extreme cases, these calls {{may be used to}} warn predators that they have been identified. Adults mark vegetation in their territories with a colourless secretion of preorbital glands, that soon condenses to form a white film. They maintain multiple latrine sites where piles of their pellet <b>droppings</b> are formed by regular use. Latrine sites can be confused with those of the barking deer but the pellets are longer and larger in four-horned antelopes. Submissive display consists of shrinking the body, lowering the head and pulling the ears back. Predators of four-horned antelopes include tigers, leopards, and dholes.|$|E
5|$|The thin {{long legs}} of the {{hartebeest}} provide for a quick escape in an open habitat; if attacked, the formidable horns are used {{to ward off the}} predator. The elevated position of the eyes enables the hartebeest to inspect its surroundings continuously even as it is grazing. The muzzle has evolved so as to derive maximum nutrition from even a frugal diet. The horns are also used during fights among males for dominance in the breeding season; the clash of the horns is loud enough that it can be heard from hundreds of metres away. The beginning of a fight is marked with a series of head movements and stances, as well as depositing <b>droppings</b> on dung piles. The opponents drop onto their knees and, after giving a hammer-like blow, begin wrestling, their horns interlocking. One attempts to fling the head of the other to one side to stab the neck and shoulders with his horns. Fights are rarely serious, but can be fatal if they are.|$|E
