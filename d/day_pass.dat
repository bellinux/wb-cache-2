5|$|On September 18, 2013, Nintendo {{announced}} Wii Sports Club for the Wii U Nintendo eShop. The game {{features the}} five games of Wii Sports remade in high-definition graphics, with {{support for the}} Wii MotionPlus (similar to Wii Sports Resort) and online multiplayer. The game uses a 'Club' system, in which players are registered to regional or national clubs, communicating with each other via Miiverse, and compete against other clubs for rankings. After a 24-hour free trial period, players can purchase a <b>day</b> <b>pass</b> to access all of the games, or purchase full access to the individual games. Tennis and Bowling were released on November 7, 2013, with the other games to follow at later dates.|$|E
25|$|Some forest {{activities}} require permits. The type of {{permit and}} its cost {{depends on the}} specific recreational activity. A Northwest Forest Pass is required for parking at some high-use trailheads. The cost is $30 for an annual pass or $5 for a <b>day</b> <b>pass.</b> The Forest Service uses the permit revenue for trail maintenance. Permits are also required for firewood cutting, Christmas tree harvesting, and mushroom gathering. A special permit is required to raft on the Snake River.|$|E

25|$|After {{they held}} their 13–0 lead through the third quarter, Hal Hughes intercepted an Oliver <b>Day</b> <b>pass</b> and {{returned}} it 25-yards for an Alabama touchdown to make the score 19–0 after Vic Bradford missed his second extra point of the game. Later in the fourth, the Trojans scored their only points of the game. The one-yard Day touchdown run was set up after Al Krueger recovered Charley Boswell fumbled punt at the Alabama one-yard line. The victory was their first all-time against USC. Over 6,000 fans greeted the team at the Alabama Great Southern Railroad station in downtown Tuscaloosa upon their arrival the following Tuesday to celebrate their victory.|$|E
25|$|On March 29, 2010, the STM {{introduced}} the 747 Montreal-Trudeau/Downtown route. Operating 7 days a week, 24 {{hours a day}} and 365 days a year, this route connects the airport to eight downtown stops, including transfer stops at Lionel-Groulx metro station, Central Station and Berri-UQAM metro station. The service runs every 10–12 minutes from 8:30a.m. to 8 p.m, every 30 minutes from 5:30a.m. to 8:30a.m. and 8 p.m. to 1 a.m., and every hour from 2 a.m. to 5 a.m. Regular bus fare is not accepted; the minimum tariff is a <b>day</b> <b>pass</b> ($10) but STM and AMT pass-type fares with a longer duration (3-day, weekly, monthly and Unlimited Weekend) are also accepted.|$|E
25|$|On July 13, 1991, Bruce Hamill {{went to a}} {{hardware}} store, bought a plumber's wrench, hatchet, knives and a sleeping bag, {{then went to the}} Brockville hospital and signed out Krueger on his first publicly escorted <b>day</b> <b>pass.</b> During the first hour of his first weekend pass (unsupervised release) in 34 years, Krueger arranged to meet Dennis Kerr in the woods near Brockville where Krueger would loan Kerr five hundred dollars. When Dennis Kerr arrived as instructed, Krueger struck him in the head with the pipe wrench and continued to beat him into unconsciousness. Krueger and Hamill then seized the hatchet and knife they had hidden in the bushes while waiting for Kerr's arrival and hacked and stabbed Kerr, mutilating his body, cutting it open, and nearly severing his head. Drenched in Kerr's blood, they then stripped themselves naked and sodomized the corpse. Krueger then left the scene, walked to a police station about two miles away, and turned himself in.|$|E

25|$|Aurora {{straddles}} Interstate 70, Interstate 225 and the E-470 beltway. The Regional Transportation District's {{light rail}} transit system was extended to serve the southwestern edge of Aurora on November 17, 2006. The H Line stops at Aurora's Dayton and Nine Mile Stations; a comprehensive network of feeder buses in southern Aurora serve the latter. An extension of light rail along I-225 through the city is planned to connect with a commuter rail line between downtown Denver and Denver International Airport (DIA), both scheduled for completion by 2017 (see FasTracks). Much of Aurora is more convenient to DIA than Denver itself. This proximity {{is a factor in}} the expected growth of the E-470 corridor directly south of DIA, projected to eventually accommodate 250,000 additional Aurora residents. On February 24, 2017, the Regional Transportation District opened the R-Line that runs from the Lincoln Station in Lone Tree south of Denver, to Peoria Station in NE Denver, where riders may board the A line providing service from Union Station in downtown Denver with several stops to Denver International Airport. The R Line makes multiple stops through the core of the central district of the City. Currently, a single <b>day</b> <b>pass</b> can pay the fare for any of the District's buses, light-rail or commuter-rail modes of transportation. So a single pass can be used to ride a bus to a light-rail station that connects to commuter-rail, like the A Line to the Airport.|$|E
500|$|SmarTrip and CharmCard have {{different}} qualifications for inter-system usage, e.g. using CharmCard on non-MTA providers, and using SmarTrip on MTA. Passes and non-cash loads (such as employee transit benefits) are stored {{on the card}} in a separate [...] "purse" [...] from cash loads. Purse benefits can only be used on the issuing system for that benefit, so a <b>day</b> <b>pass</b> issued by MTA on either a CharmCard or SmarTrip will only be valid on MTA, and a WMATA-issued monthly pass will not be valid on MTA {{even if it was}} loaded on a CharmCard. This does mean it is possible to have identical or different passes (like a monthly pass from one and a <b>day</b> <b>pass</b> from the other) from both WMATA and MTA simultaneously loaded on the same card. Monthly transit benefits provided by an employer will only be valid for whichever system the employer is registered with, so an employer who is registered to provide transit benefits with WMATA will only grant benefits usable on WMATA and Washington, DC-area transit providers, even if the benefits are loaded on a CharmCard. Cash loaded on either card is valid on both WMATA and MTA vehicles. This also means purse funds cannot be used for cash equivalents, so a person who is authorized for a monthly bus pass in employee benefits cannot use that benefit to pay for rail travel or a <b>day</b> <b>pass.</b>|$|E
500|$|McDonald's Cycle Center (formerly Millennium Park Bike Station) is {{an indoor}} bike {{station in the}} {{northeast}} corner of Millennium Park in the Loop community area of Chicago, in the U.S. state of Illinois.

500|$|Skinner and Tyrawley {{agreed that}} the most {{pressing}} threat {{was that of a}} combined land and sea assault focusing on the weakest part of the defences, the open ground between the South Front of the town and Europa Point {{at the end of the}} peninsula. However, they disagreed vehemently over where and how to construct the defences. Tyrawley put a great deal of energy into constructing new earthworks, batteries and a series of retrenched lines between the South Bastion and the New Mole, called the Prince of Wales Lines. It was said of him that he would never let a <b>day</b> <b>pass</b> [...] "without visiting the works once or twice during his stay where there was a possibility of going out." [...] Skinner disagreed with the placement of the new fortifications and criticised the use of compacted earth and sun-baked bricks, which had enabled them to be built at great speed and minimum cost, rather than stone. Skinner perhaps had a point, as most of Tyrawley's works were washed away by rain within only a few years.|$|E
