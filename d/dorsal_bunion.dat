30|$|In the forefoot, <b>dorsal</b> <b>bunion</b> of {{the first}} {{metatarsal}} may occur if there is isolated weakness of the peroneus longus muscle, or if the peroneus longus has been transferred without a concomitant transfer of the tibialis anterior muscle from the first metatarsal if the latter muscle is functioning.|$|E
30|$|Beyond the {{hindfoot}} deformities {{there can}} be deformities of the midfoot. When midfoot deformity is present it is most commonly abductus and rockerbottom. Most midfoot deformities are most commonly related to coalition between the cuboid and calcaneus. Talo-navicular joint coalition can also be present. One or more rays may be missing, making the foot narrower. Absence or weakness of the peroneus longus may lead to overpull of the tibialis anterior and elevation of the first metatarsal with compensatory flexion of the first metatarsophalangeal joint (<b>dorsal</b> <b>bunion).</b> A bracket first metatarsal or a bracket conjoined first and second metatarsal with hallux varus is not uncommon. Syndactaly between {{some or all of}} the toes is also common.|$|E
40|$|Chronic rupture of both tendons of the peroneus longus and brevis is rare. Thus, it is {{difficult}} to diagnose and often overlooked. Since the peroneal tendons are the primary evertors of the foot and function as lateral ankle stabilizers, their rupture results in ankle sprain. We present a case with dynamic supination deformity during ambulation and hindfoot varus induced by chronic rupture of both tendons of the peroneus longus and brevis. We treated the patient with split anterior tibial tendon transfer and Dwyer calcaneal osteotomy. The dynamic supination deformity during ambulation and the hindfoot varus were improved, but a <b>dorsal</b> <b>bunion</b> remained, which was suggestive of residual dysfunction of the tendon of the peroneus longus...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} {{possible}} pitfalls of clubfoot releases {{and it is}} important to recognize the problems and provide proper timely treatment. Late residual deformity following clubfoot releases include: dynamic or stiff supination and forefoot adduction deformities, intoeing gait, overcorrection, rotatory dorsal subluxation of the navicular, vascular insult to the talus with collapse, and <b>dorsal</b> <b>bunion.</b> We reviewed 134 clubfeet in 95 children who had primary clubfoot releases between 1988 and 1991. In general, the patients who underwent surgery before 6  months of age had poorer results compared with older children. Twenty-one feet (15. 7 %) underwent additional procedures. The most common additional procedure was split anterior tibial tendon transfer. Not all patients with residual deformities underwent additional procedures. In treating recurrent and residual deformity following a clubfoot surgery, it is most important to keep function in mind. From this series of patients treated with comprehensive clubfoot release, we have identified the most common residual deformities encountered after the initial release and effective surgical treatment when necessary...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUNDS: Residual {{deformities}} of operatively treated severe clubfeet evaluated radiographically {{have been}} rarely studied {{in detail in}} adults. METHODS: Twenty-five operatively treated stiff clubfeet were analyzed at {{a mean age of}} 21 years and 6 months. The clinical evaluation used the Laaveg and Ponseti scale for clubfeet. Radiographic assessment was done with weightbearing and dynamic views. RESULTS: Clinical evaluation was globally good except for motion (poor). Radiographic assessment showed residual abnormalities in all feet. The distal tibial epiphysis showed slanting of its posterior part in seven feet (28 %) and notching of its anterior lip in 13 (52 %). Talar length, calcaneal length, and talar trochlear height were significantly smaller in clubfeet compared to normal feet. Undercorrection of hindfoot varus, was found in 19 feet (76 %) but was well tolerated. Navicular wedging was present in seven (28 %), and cavus deformity was found in seven (28 %). <b>Dorsal</b> <b>bunion,</b> hallux varus, and skewfoot were found in four (16 %), two (8 %), and three (12 %), respectively. The dynamic views demonstrated a significant decrease in the foot and ankle mobility with compensation mechanisms such as anterior talar incongruence or midfoot hypermobility. CONCLUSION: Severe clubfeet never become normal at adult age either clinically or radiographically. Multiple radiographic deformities exist. Their etiology and possible prevention are discussed. Despite the numerous abnormalities, clinical results were good at skeletal maturity...|$|E
30|$|The SUPERankle {{procedure}} was first {{developed by the}} author in 1996 [24]. This procedure achieves a stable plantigrade foot and ankle. It can be combined with lengthening, {{but it does not}} have to be. I prefer to perform this procedure between when the patient is between 18 and 24  months of age {{if it is to be}} combined with lengthening at the same time. I have performed the SUPERankle as early as 12  months of age, without lengthening. The original Paley SUPERankle procedure involved surgical lengthening of the Achilles and peroneal tendons [16] combined with opening wedge osteotomies of the distal tibia and/or subtalar coalition. While the results of this original SUPERankle procedure were excellent, the author noticed that in long-term followup there was weak push-off strength due to the lengthening of the Achilles tendon. Furthermore, many patients developed a supination midfoot deformity with a <b>dorsal</b> <b>bunion</b> due to overpull of the tibialis anterior from a weak peroneus longus tendon. In 2008, the author modified the procedure to avoid lengthening the Achilles or peroneus longus tendons by shortening the distal tibial osteotomy instead of performing an opening wedge at that level. This newer version of the SUPERankle produced much better functional results with respect to the strength of the gastro-soleus muscles and the peroneal muscles. Push-off strength was conserved, and no supination deformity resulted. The following description is therefore the SUPERankle procedure as currently performed by the author (Figs.  18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35). While others [16] have suggested separating the lengthening from the SUPERankle procedure, this author sees no advantage to this proposed alternative procedure. The concern that simultaneous lengthening with the SUPERankle could result in increased stiffness of the ankle joint has not been borne out in this author’s experience (Figs.  34, 35). The primary determinant of the ankle range of motion is related to the dysplasia of the ankle joint. The talus in most of these patients has a very limited arc of curvature and a short talar neck. Plantar flexion is limited by impingement with the calcaneus posteriorly, due to the subtalar coalition and the malposition of the calcaneus with the talus. Dorsiflexion is limited by the short neck of the talus and its impingement with the neck due to the lack of talar neck offset (concavity). The less dysplastic the talus is to begin with, the greater the potential range of ankle motion; the more dysplastic the talar anatomy, the greater the limitation of ankle motion. Therefore, whether the SUPERankle is performed with or without lengthening, the range of motion of the ankle is not impacted. The goal of the SUPERankle procedure is to correct the alignment and stability of the ankle joint and foot.|$|E
40|$|Purpose of the {{symposium}} Treatment of idiopathic talipes varus, or congenital clubfoot, {{is designed to}} realign the foot to alleviate pain and allow plantigrade weight bearing with adequate joint motion despite the subnormal radiographic presentation. This symposium was held to review current management practices for congenital clubfoot in children and to analyze outcome in adults in order to propose the most appropriate therapeutic solutions. Management of congenital clubfoot in children Idiopathic talipes varus can be suspected from the fetal ultrasound. Parents should be given precise information concerning proposed treatment after birth. Deviations must be assessed in the newborn then revised regularly using objective scales {{during and after the}} end of treatment. This enables a better apprehension of the evolution in comparison with the severity of the initial deformation. Conservative treatment is proposed by many teams: a functional approach (rehabilitation and minimal use of orthetic material) or the Ponseti method (progressive correction using casts associated with percutaneous tenotomy of the calcaneal tendon) are currently preferred. If such methods are insufficient or unsuccessful, surgery may be performed as needed at about 8 to 11 months to achieve posteromedial release. Good results are obtained in 80 % of patients who generally present minimal residual deformations (adduction of the forefoot, minimal calcaneal varus, residual medial rotation, limitation of dorsal flexion), which must be followed regularly through growth. The difficulty is to distinguish acceptable from non-acceptable deformation. At the end of the growth phase, severe articular sequelae are rare (stiff joint, recurrence of initial deformation, overcorrection) but difficult to correct surgically: osteotomy, tendon transfer, double arthrodesis, Ilizarov fixator. Gait analysis is essential to quantify function and obtain an objective assessment of the impact on higher joints, providing valuable guidance for surgical correction. Outcome in adulthood There have been very few studies evaluating the long-term functional outcome after treatment during childhood. According to two studies presented at this symposium (Brussels, Lausanne), results have been generally good but with subnormal radiographs irrespective of the type of treatment or how early treatment started in childhood. Hypoplasia of the talar dome is a constant finding and is correlated with limitation of dorsal flexion of the ankle joint. A small degree undercorrection is often observed but well tolerated while overcorrection is generally less well tolerated. Functional outcome depends highly on preservation of subtalar joint motion. There have been no reports on the results of treatment of sequelae in adults. Most problems (pain, stiffness, osteoarthritis) are observed in the mid or rear foot. Indications for conservative surgery (osteotomy) of the mid or rear foot are rare compared with indications for combined arthrodesis. Talocrural decompensation is a turning point observed in the adult. Management at this point is difficult: fusion of the ankle worsens the situation by increasing the stress on the forefoot and aggravating the disability; implantation of an ankle prosthesis is technically difficult and remains to be fully developed. Treatment of the <b>dorsal</b> <b>bunion</b> of the great toe may require tendon transfer and/or fusion. Conclusion A child born with clubfoot will never have a normal foot in adulthood. Sequelae present at the end of growth will intensify during adult life; undercorrection is easier to treat in adulthood than overcorrection. The most difficult problems in adulthood are: neglected clubfoot, over correction, and degradation of the talocrural joint...|$|E
