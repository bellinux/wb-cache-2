The remnants of Pauline triggered showers over the southwest United States and may have been responsible for a damaging tornado which occurred near Glendale, Arizona.|$|E

5|$|While {{mourning}} Roth, Lara accepts {{that the}} storms are not natural, but are somehow {{connected to the}} Sun Queen and designed to prevent anyone from leaving the island. She meets up with her friends (Reyes, Jonah, Alex, and Sam), who have evaded the Solarii long enough to secure a boat for escaping the island, provided {{that it can be}} repaired. They are joined by Whitman, who claims to have escaped, though Lara begins to suspect him of working with the cultists. Lara joins Alex in finding parts <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> in the wreck of the Endurance. She finds him injured and stuck under some rubble. They come under attack by the Solarii and Alex triggers an explosion, sacrificing himself so that Lara can escape with the tools.|$|E
5|$|During her {{short-lived}} presidency, a {{truck with}} nuclear energy goes missing and puts D.C. into lock-down, a scheme devised by {{several members of}} Frank's cabinet and Conway's campaign. During the emergency, Claire is visited by diplomat Jane Davis (Patricia Clarkson), who says that she can track down a leader of ICO for the Underwoods. Claire is also faced {{with a series of}} diplomatic crises: Russian soldiers have also taken over an American base, and the Russians and Chinese are vying for possession of a boat in Antarctica that has a stowaway American working for the Russians. After making a deal with the Chinese, Claire orders <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> to be destroyed so that neither the Chinese nor the Russians can get what is on board. Around this time, Claire agrees to an open election in Ohio for not only the President, but also the Vice President, in order to avoid a possible Conway-Underwood administration.|$|E
5|$|In Nova Scotia, Able {{produced}} hurricane-force winds, {{the only}} land along its path to receive such winds; {{a gust of}} 99mph (160km/h) was reported in Halifax. The hurricane also dropped heavy rainfall, including over 4.92inches (125mm) in Annapolis Valley. Initially there were three fishing boats missing throughout the region, although two later returned to harbor. By August22, the third was still missing over the Grand Banks, which prompted a rescue team to search <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat.</b> Many other boats crashed against the coast, and two children died when their raft capsized. Two bridges and several roadways were washed out or flooded, and in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, floodwaters left roadways impassable. On land, Able produced heavy damage estimated at over $1million (CAD), half of which in Annapolis Valley, and split between crops, communications, and fishing industries.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{well-known}} wharf to the railways travelling public was wharf no. 2, {{also known as the}} Steamer Express Wharf, which for over 70 years served as the inter-island ferry wharf <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> trains that terminated at Lyttelton. From 1902, trains collected passengers from, and delivered passengers to, ferries berthed at this wharf. The ferries were operated by the Union Steam Ship Company until 1974, at which point the Ministry of Transport took over the operation until the service was cancelled in 1976.|$|E
50|$|They {{were armed}} with four Škoda 47 mm L/33 guns and three 450 mm torpedo tubes. The 47 mm guns were license-built {{versions}} of the British QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss gun; they had a rate of fire of 25 rounds per minute and an effective range of 3000 m. The 450 mm torpedoes were the L/5 type, which carried a 95 kg warhead and had a range of 3,000 m at a speed of 32 kn. Later variants increased the warhead to 110 kg and the range to 6000 m at 27 kn. In 1915, one 8 mm machine gun was added. <b>The</b> <b>boats</b> were initially given names, but were redesignated with numbers on 1 January 1914, with three suffixes; E <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Yarrow <b>boat</b> built in England, T <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> built in Trieste, and F <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> built in Fiume.|$|R

25|$|Locks were {{typically}} 100 feet long, 15 feet wide, and 16 feet deep, and the lifts averaged about 8 feet (between 6 and 10). Inside {{dimensions of the}} lock, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat,</b> are over 90', for instance Lock 28 (Point of Rocks) is 90' 9", whereas typical freight boats were 92' long (including the rudder), making it necessary to turn the rudder to the side to fit in the lock. Lock 36, however, was known among boatmen for being troublesome, since it had a usable length of 89 feet 11 inches, being the only lock less than 90 feet in length. Locks were often whitewashed to facilitate low light (i.e., at dawn or dusk) visibility.|$|E
25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 29 September 1803, Jackall sighted and chased a sloop running along the shore between Nieuport and Dunkirk. The wind fell so Leaver sent 11 men in a boat to board the quarry. As the British approached, the sloop ran ashore near three field pieces and a small battery of two guns, and her crew of 10 or 12 men escaped on shore. Jackall, which had been using her sweeps, and {{with the assistance of}} a light breeze that had arisen, came up and provided support <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> and the sloop, which the boarding party had gotten off. The sloop turned out to be from Dunkirk, armed with four 2-pounder guns, and possibly serving to transport troops. Despite the fire from the sloop before she grounded, and the guns on shore, which were within 25 yards of the sloop, the British sustained no casualties. The sloop turned out to be San Façon.|$|E

50|$|Fishing was an {{important}} business in Sark and permission was given to fish within 3 mi and for two boats to travel to Guernsey to sell their catches and bring back petrol <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats.</b> Once a week <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> would call into Herm and Jethou to deliver supplies.|$|R

50|$|Riders enter a long indoor queue {{with several}} switchbacks. The queue then bridges across {{part of the}} ride's water storage area before {{reaching}} the circular station.

500|$|Chiswick Bridge {{is a major}} {{transport}} route, and {{the eighth}} busiest of London's 20 Thames road bridges.

500|$|Based on {{the trials}} results, the Austro-Hungarian Navy {{determined}} {{the characteristics that}} {{the next generation of}} Austro-Hungarian submarines should have.

The Austro-Hungarian Navy selected the Germaniawerft 506d design, also known as the Type UD, for the U-7 class over the Type 48 design submitted by Whitehead & Co., primarily because of the lower cost. The Navy ordered five boats on 1 February 1913.|$|E
