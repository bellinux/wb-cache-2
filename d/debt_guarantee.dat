In June 2017, Murdoch, Gordon and Packer withdrew support for a $250 million guaranteed loan that would remedy the expiring $200 million <b>debt</b> <b>guarantee.</b> In response, Ten requested its shares on the Australian Securities Exchange {{be placed in a}} 48 hour trading halt while it assessed its options concerning receivership. On June 14, Ten went into voluntary administration.|$|E

Wilson and Wu (2011) find that the recipients of the FDIC debt guarantees paid their CEOs significantly more than their peers. Thus, bailed out CEOs mad significantly more than bank CEOs not accepting the FDIC's bailout loan guarantees.|$|E

40|$|This paper compares two {{strategies}} for replicating a put option used to synthetize a <b>debt</b> <b>guarantee</b> contract. The first strategy, super-replication, {{while maintaining the}} portfolio value greater or equal to a target value, minimizes the transaction cost of replicating a debt insurance put option by using dynamic linear programming. The second strategy replicates this put option by maximizing the guarantor's expected utility. A comparative study shows that both strategies give better results than the Leland (1985) method. If we use a risk-adjusted performance metric, the utility-based method performs best when transaction costs are relatively low. When transaction costs are relatively high, the two strategies yield similar results and still outperform Leland's. <b>Debt</b> <b>guarantee</b> Synthetic put option Hedging Replication Transaction costs...|$|E

40|$|Liabilities can be {{guaranteed}} {{by a third}} party. Guarantees are arrangements whereby the guarantor commits to pay or assume the liability of another entity (the original debtor) if certain conditions are met (such as inability of the original debtor to pay). Guarantees may include repayments of principal and/or interest payments. A <b>debt</b> <b>guarantee</b> involves three institutional units: original creditor, original debtor, and guarantor. Activation of a <b>debt</b> <b>guarantee</b> creates a new liability and the guarantor now becomes the new debtor. This raises issues on how to treat flows between the original debtor and creditor and between the original debtor and the guarantor (the new debtor). Activation of guarantees affects transactions or other economic flows. Usual cases of guarantees in terms of institutional units involved and motivations may be: (1) government providing guarantees for borrowing by public enterprises or private enterprises (for example, to encourage certain types of activities), (2) financial intermediaries providing guarantees as services for payment of a fee, and (3) parents providing guarantees for their subsidiaries (for example, to cut interest costs). The treatment of flows arising from an activation of guarantees may also need to conside...|$|E

This paper develops three alternative simple models to derive optimal capital structure. Because the optimal leverage ratio determined by the models is close to most survey data, some relevant puzzles, such as “financial conservatism”, are easily explained. In addition, the new models can be extended to accommodate various decision situations, for instance, abnormal growth, bankrupt expectancy, <b>debt</b> <b>guarantee,</b> transaction cost, and personal income tax.|$|E

40|$|We {{characterize}} cost-minimizing {{interventions to}} restore lending and investment when markets fail due to adverse selection.

In this environment, we find that the government cannot selectively attract good borrowers, that the efficiency of an intervention is fully determined by the market rate for non-participating borrowers, and that simple programs of <b>debt</b> <b>guarantee</b> are optimal, while equity injections or asset purchases are not.

40|$|During the Scandinavian banking {{crisis in}} the early 1990 s, Norway and Sweden chose {{somewhat}} different routes to crisis resolution, though both involved government intervention and both proved effective. The Norwegian government injected a hybrid debt-equity form of capital into the largest commercial bank, though only after first extinguishing old equity claims. The Swedish government issued a system-wide <b>debt</b> <b>guarantee</b> and allowed shareholders to maintain their equity stakes, provided they also contributed new equity capital to the banks. In the (single) case where equityholders refused to participate, the government took over the bank and divided it into a "good" and "bad" part, with the latter holding the non-performing loans.

40|$|Using {{earnings}} announcement events made by firms {{belonging to}} Korean chaebols, we examine propping within a chaebol. Consistent with the market's ex ante valuation of intragroup propping, {{we find that}} the announcement of increased (decreased) earnings by a chaebol-affiliated firm has a positive (negative) effect on the market value of other nonannouncing affiliates. The sensitivity of the change in the market value of nonannouncing affiliates to abnormal returns for the announcing firms is higher if the cash flow right of the announcing firm's controlling shareholder is higher. The sensitivity is also higher if the announcing firm is larger, performs well, and has a higher <b>debt</b> <b>guarantee</b> ratio. The Author 2008.

Can a single currency be shared between countries with different cyclical situations, structural problems and economic strategies? Is a single currency consistent with independent domestic fiscal policies? In 1992, EU countries answered 'yes' to these questions by signing the Maastricht Treaty. Starting from then, euro area governance was characterized by independent domestic fiscal policies however constrained to fulfil several criteria (public deficit below 3 % of GDP, public debt below 60 % of GDP), a single monetary policy entrusted to an independent central bank, the absence of public <b>debt</b> <b>guarantee</b> and fiscal solidarity between member states ( [...] .) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{economic}} crisis {{which started in}} 2008 led to a strong rise in public debts. The sovereign debt crisis in euro area southern countries breached {{the unity of the}} euro area and weakened the ‘single currency ’ concept. The paper shows that this situation is not {{due to a lack of}} fiscal discipline in Europe, but to drifts in financial capitalism and to an inappropriately designed euro area economic policy framework. Public debts homogeneity needs to be resettled in Europe. European public debts should become safe assets again, and should not be subject to financial markets ’ assessment. European Member States should not be requested to pay for past sins through austerity measures, and should not strengthen fiscal discipline through rules lacking economic rationale. The paper deals with recent proposals which have been made to improve euro area governance (redemption fund, Eurobonds, public <b>debt</b> <b>guarantee</b> by the ECB).
