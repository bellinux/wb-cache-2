500|$|Much of the {{scholarly}} appreciation of Wright's work is fairly recent. In 1982, {{an exhibition of}} his work: ‘John Michael Wright – The King’s Painter’ – in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery – led to {{a renewed interest in}} his contributions, and the catalogue (edited by Sara Stevenson and Duncan Thomson) re-wrote and uncovered much of the known biographical details. New works continue to be discovered and previously known ones re-attributed to him. Wright is now viewed as amongst the most successful of seventeenth-century Britain's indigenous artists, and is rated alongside contemporaries such as Robert Walker and William Dobson. One modern exhibition catalogue described him as [...] "the finest seventeenth century British-born painter". Certainly, {{he was one of the}} few who painted the elite aristocracy of his day, and was responsible for some of the most magnificent royal portraiture surviving. This achievement is particularly significant in an age where even British patrons had tended to favour foreign artists like Holbein and Van Dyck, and would continue to favour immigrants such as Lely and Kneller. Indeed, part of the reason for Wright's success is recognised as being his unusually cosmopolitan training: no prior British artist had so much exposure to European influence. During his Italian sojourn, and his participation in the Accademia di San Luca, not only had Wright collected works attributed to continental <b>giants</b> <b>like</b> Michelangelo, Raphael and Titian, he had also been influenced by, and even copied, much of their tone and style.|$|E

Jupiter orbits the Sun at about five times the distance between the Earth and the Sun. This is the rough distance we should expect to find good Jupiters elsewhere.

2500|$|It {{would help}} to revitalize rock {{movements}} in other Latin American countries for two reasons: 1) It would create a buzz and excitement in the local rock scenes; 2) it proved to producers and record labels in those countries that [...] "Rock en Español" [...] could work and make them money. In Mexico, Argentine bands were being marketed by media <b>giants</b> <b>like</b> Televisa as [...] "rock in your language". Its success changed {{the landscape of the}} Mexican scene: it laid the groundwork for Mexican rock in Spanish to itself expand overseas. In Peru, the Argentine invasion was a catalyst that brought that country's own movement more to the mainstream. In Chile, where a few outstanding bands existed even prior to the Argentine boom (see Los Prisioneros), the flood of rock music coming from their eastern neighbor would fully energize and inspire the local scene, and Argentine rock's influence continues to this day. The current boom in Colombian rock {{can be traced to the}} 1980s, with most Colombian rock acts citing the Argentine invasion groups as a direct influence.
