Despite new Lewes manager Kevin Keehan's view that [...] "if I could have had only one player <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> from last season, it would be Simon" [...] being reflected in the club offering him better terms than did Eastbourne Borough, Wormull, together with teammate Jean-Michel Sigere, joined their local rivals in June 2008.|$|E
500|$|The Shadows (consisting of {{band members}} Brian Bennett, Hank Marvin, John Rostill and Bruce Welch) as Themselves, {{complementing}} Cliff Richard Jr in Alan Tracy's dream sequence set at The Swinging Star. Bennett remembers the puppet {{that was based}} on his likeness: [...] "The first thing I did was to ask if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> him when filming was finished, but apparently he was to be turned into another character after the film had been finished." ...|$|E
500|$|After Singer {{completed}} {{the three major}} productions X-Men (2000), X2 (2003) and Superman Returns (2006), he sought a smaller project before embarking upon the eventually aborted sequel to Superman Returns. Singer and McQuarrie had often made World War II films in their backyards {{while growing up in}} New Jersey, and Singer had later dealt with Nazi subject matter in Apt Pupil and X-Men. Singer first learned of the plot in the early 1980s when his mother visited Bonn and met Freya von Moltke, widow of Helmuth von Moltke, a founder of the Kreisau Circle resistance group. After learning of McQuarrie and Alexander's screenplay and signing on to direct, Singer read The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich by William L. Shirer to gain deeper understanding of Nazi Germany's political landscape, and also met with one of Hitler's bodyguards, Rochus Misch, who was the last person to leave the bunker where Hitler committed suicide. The creative team acknowledged the ambiguity over the enigmatic von Stauffenberg's true motivation, but Singer and McQuarrie judged him to be a man of ethics just from what he did. Though McQuarrie sought for Valkyrie to be similar to Conspiracy, Singer had bigger ambitions for the film, wanting it to be more than [...] "old men in rooms, talking". Singer looked back on his decision, saying, [...] "The true story had all the makings of a classic assassination thriller.... I knew if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> the audience with [...] Stauffenberg, with his mission, they would go with the flow and be less inclined to start hypothesising on things from history." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Many of {{you know}} me as a legendary boxer, and I'm proud of that," [...] he said. [...] "However, that journey was not always easy. When I was younger, I became a fighter because I had to survive. I had nothing. I {{had no one to}} depend on except myself. I {{realized}} that boxing was something I was good at, and I trained hard so that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> myself and my family alive." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} Mueller gave different reasons for leaving, [...] "One {{is that the}} decision {{had been made to}} terminate the Apollo program, and that was a good time then to leave before, and let someone else take over for the next phase. From a practical point of view, I needed to go make some money so <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> my family going. It was costly for us to join the Apollo program. My salary was half what I was making in industry when I went there, {{and it was just a}} strain to keep the family going and work going at the same time. So I went back to industry.".|$|E
2500|$|When {{talking about}} {{the close of the}} title, Cornell stated [...] "Our {{audience}} really left at issue four... People protest about events, but try and write a comic now without them.

I’d be part of an event every issue if I could, if it meant <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> the title going. ... after [...] Birmingham I realised that the only way the book would survive would be huge event stories of our own." [...] He also said he might've had the characters visit America early on if he'd known how long he had, or put more action into Hell Comes To Birmingham.|$|E

2500|$|A third enemy plane {{appeared}} in my ‘10 o’clock’, {{from the right}} to the left: in simple words, almost in the opposite direction. [...] The first MiG zoomed away and I engaged the afterburner to get in an attack position against this new enemy. [...] I reared up my aircraft in a 45 degree angle, inside his turn. [...] He was turning to the left, so I pulled the stick and barrel-rolled to the right. [...] Thanks to this maneuver, I found myself above him, half upside down. [...] I held it until the MiG finished his turn, calculating the time so that, if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> on turning behind him, I would get on his tail, with a deflection angle of 20 degrees, {{at a distance of}} 1,500 yards. [...] That was exactly what happened. [...] He never saw me. [...] Behind and lower than him, I could clearly see his silhouette against the sun when I launched two Sidewinders. One of them impacted and tore apart his right wing.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding his {{treatment}} of the family he had with his wife, he stated, [...] "I am not the beast the media make me to be". Regarding {{his treatment}} of Elisabeth and her children in the cellar, {{he explained that he}} brought flowers for Elisabeth and books and toys for the children into the [...] "bunker", as he called it, and often watched videos with the children and ate meals with Elisabeth and the children. Fritzl decided to imprison Elisabeth after she [...] "did not adhere to any rules any more" [...] when she became a teenager. [...] "That is why I had to do something; I had to create a place where <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> Elisabeth, by force if necessary, away from the outside world." [...] He suggested that the emphasis on discipline in the Nazi era, during which he grew up, might have influenced his views about decency and good behavior. The chief editors of News magazine noted in their editorial that they expected Fritzl's statement to form the basis of the defence strategy of his lawyer. Critics said his statement may have been a ploy to prepare an insanity defence.|$|E
