5|$|The Puerto Rican amazon reaches sexual {{maturity}} at {{between three and}} four years of age. It reproduces once a year and is a cavity nester. Once the female lays eggs she {{will remain in the}} nest and continuously incubate them until hatching. The chicks are fed by both parents and will fledge 60 to 65 days after hatching. This parrot's diet is varied and consists of flowers, fruits, leaves, bark and nectar obtained from the <b>forest</b> <b>canopy.</b>|$|E
5|$|The mixed {{woodland}} region is a dense forest with {{many species of}} trees, located near {{the tops of the}} plateaus. The <b>forest</b> <b>canopy</b> shades the ground, resulting in a cooler temperature. The canopy also reduces the amount of water evaporation. California black oak, Douglas fir, Pacific madrone, incense cedar, and other plants grow in the {{mixed woodland}}. Shrubs such as Oregon grape, honeysuckle, blue elderberry, and Pacific poison oak also grow here. The soil in this area is mostly loam.|$|E
5|$|The {{purple-throated cotinga}} feeds {{primarily}} on the fruits of forest trees, most notably those belonging to the genus Cecropia. It also occasionally consumes small invertebrates, such as insects. All reported observations of the species feeding involve the cotinga leaning down from its perch to pluck fruit off a tree in the <b>forest</b> <b>canopy.</b> These birds are distinct from similar species {{in that they are}} often seen in pairs. This species perches in the canopy to take in the morning sun.|$|E

5|$|Antbirds are diurnal: they feed, breed {{and defend}} territories during the day. Many {{of the family}} are, however, {{reluctant}} to enter areas of direct sunlight where it breaks through the <b>forest</b> <b>canopy.</b> Antbirds will engage in anting, a behaviour in which ants (or other arthropods) are rubbed on the feathers before being discarded or eaten. While this has conventionally been considered a way to remove and control feather parasites, {{it has been suggested}} that for antbirds it may simply be a way to deal with the distasteful substances in prey items.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{occupy a}} wide range of {{ecological}} positions. While some birds are generalists, others are highly specialised in their habitat or food requirements. Even within a single habitat, such as a forest, the niches occupied by different species of birds vary, with some species feeding in the <b>forest</b> <b>canopy,</b> others beneath the canopy, and still others on the forest floor. Forest birds may be insectivores, frugivores, and nectarivores. Aquatic birds generally feed by fishing, plant eating, and piracy or kleptoparasitism. Birds of prey specialise in hunting mammals or other birds, while vultures are specialised scavengers. Avivores are animals that are specialised at preying on birds.|$|E
5|$|Few Myxogastria {{species are}} found in the tropics and subtropics, mainly because of the high {{humidity}} which prevents the necessary dehydration of the fruit bodies to permit spore dispersal and promotes infestation by moulds. Other factors are low light levels under the <b>forest</b> <b>canopy</b> which reduces phototaxis, light winds, poor soils, natural enemies and heavy rainfall which can wash away or destroy cells. Species living in soil or deadwood decrease as humidity increases. In a study from Costa Rica, 73% of the total findings were in the relatively dry Tropical Moist Forest, while 18% were in the very moist Tropical Premontane Wet Forests and only 9% in Lower Premontane Rain Forest.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} whether accurately simulating vertical air temperature (AT) distribution within <b>forest</b> <b>canopies</b> {{is essential for}} predicting vertical photosynthesis and transpiration distribution using multilayer canopy models. Inspecting earlier observational studies that reported vertical AT distribution within <b>forest</b> <b>canopies,</b> we showed that the common vertical AT difference within <b>forest</b> <b>canopies</b> was lower than 3. 0 ℃. We showed, using a leaf-scale transpiration-photosynthesis model, that a 3. 0 ℃ AT difference caused smaller differences in leaf- scale photosynthesis and transpiration rates than a common vertical difference in photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) intensity within <b>forest</b> <b>canopies</b> when AT was higher than ca. 15 ℃. While, the AT difference caused larger differences in leaf-scale photosynthetic and transpiration rates than the PAR difference when AT was lower than ca. 10 ℃. However, the ranges in the rates with changing AT by 3. 0 ℃ were comparable with predictability of a leaf-scale transpiration-photosynthesis model. Thus, we conclude that accurately simulating AT distribution is not essential at this stage for calculating vertical photosynthesis and transpiration distribution using multilayer canopy models. 本研究では、林内気温鉛直分布を正確に再現することが、林内光合成・蒸散鉛直分布を多層モデルで推定するのに不可欠かどうかを調べた。筆者らは既存文献を踏査して、林内で計測される鉛直方向の気温差が通常 3. 0 ℃以下であることを示した。つづいて、単葉スケールの蒸散・光合成モデルによる計算によってつぎのことを示した。気温が約 15 ℃以上のとき、 3. 0 ℃の気温の差が引き起こす光合成・蒸散量の違いは、林内で通常計測される光合成有効放射量の鉛直方向の差が引き起こす光合成・蒸散量の違いよりも小さい。一方、気温が約 10 ℃以下のとき、 3. 0 ℃の気温の差が引き起こす光合成・蒸散量の違いは、林内で通常計測される光合成有効放射量の鉛直方向の差が引き起こす光合成・蒸散量の違いよりも大きいが 3. 0 ℃の気温の差が引き起こす光合成・蒸散量の違いは、単葉スケールの蒸散・光合成モデルの予測精度と同程度である。したがって、現時点において、林内気温鉛直分布を正確に再現することは、林内光合成・蒸散鉛直分布を多層モデルで推定するのに不可欠ではないと結論した...|$|R
5|$|Frequent {{cyclones}} also pose a threat, {{particularly to}} concentrated or small populations. In late January 1997, Cyclone Gretelle destroyed 80% of the Manombo <b>forest</b> <b>canopy.</b> With their habitat, including {{most of their}} food resources, effectively destroyed, the ruffed lemurs of the forest broadened their diet, remaining surprisingly frugivorous. Their body weights dropped and no births were reported for four years, but they managed to stave off starvation. This event demonstrated not only their flexibility {{in the face of}} natural disasters, which may highlight the evolutionary reasons behind their reproductive capacity and litter size, but also the threat faced by already stressed populations.|$|E
5|$|The {{main effects}} of {{tropical}} cyclones include heavy rain, strong wind, large storm surges at landfall, and tornadoes. The destruction from a tropical cyclone depends mainly on its intensity, its size, and its location. Tropical cyclones act to remove <b>forest</b> <b>canopy</b> as well as change the landscape near coastal areas, by moving and reshaping sand dunes and causing extensive erosion along the coast. Even well inland, heavy rainfall can lead to mudslides and landslides in mountainous areas. Their effects can be sensed over time by studying the concentration of the Oxygen-18 isotope within caves within the vicinity of cyclones' paths being very hazardous to people's life.|$|E
5|$|Over 40 {{species of}} mammals have been documented, {{including}} the black bear, coyote, cougar, bobcat, beaver, river otter, black-tailed deer, and elk. Along the coastline, California sea lions, Steller sea lions and harbor seals {{live near the}} shore and on seastacks, rocky outcroppings forming small islands just off the coast. Dolphins and Pacific gray whales are occasionally seen offshore. Roosevelt elk are the most readily observed of the large mammals in the park. Successful herds, brought back from the verge of extinction in the region, are now a common site in park areas south of the Klamath River. Many smaller mammals live in the high <b>forest</b> <b>canopy.</b> Different species of bats, such as the big brown bat, and other smaller mammals including the red squirrel and northern flying squirrel {{spend most of their}} lives well above the forest floor.|$|E

40|$|Characteristics of edges {{affect the}} {{behavior}} of species that are active in and near edges. <b>Forest</b> <b>canopies</b> may provide edge-like habitat for bats, though bat response to edge orientation has not been well examined. We sampled bat activity in quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) <b>forest</b> <b>canopies</b> and edges in Heber Valley, Utah, during summer 2009 using Anabat detectors. Categorization and regression tree (CART) analysis of echolocation characteristics (e. g., frequency, duration) identified two guilds based on characteristic frequency (i. e., high- and low-frequency guilds). We used linear regression to compare characteristics of canopy and edge vegetation (e. g., tree height, diameter at breast height) to bat activity levels. Activity levels of high-frequency bats did not respond differentially to edge vegetation; low-frequency bat activity seemed to respond to canopy height. Activity levels of high-frequency bats were significantly greater than low-frequency bats in both edges and canopies. We detected significantly more bat activity in forest edges than in <b>forest</b> <b>canopies,</b> indicating the importance of edges to bats in forests...|$|R

5|$|Predation in {{the wild}} appears to be very rare for ruffed lemurs, {{probably}} because living in the high canopy makes them challenging to catch. Evidence of predation by raptors, such as the Henst's goshawk (Accipiter henstii) suggests it occurs at a low rate. The fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox) could present a potential risk if it found an individual lower in the <b>forest</b> <b>canopy,</b> but no confirmation has been presented to indicate that they prey upon ruffed lemurs. Instead, only re-introduced, captive-bred ruffed lemurs {{have been killed by}} fossa, likely due to their inexperience with predators. Nesting behavior poses the biggest risk of predation, making them susceptible to carnivorous mammals, such as the ring-tailed mongoose (Galidia elegans) and brown-tailed mongoose (Salanoia concolor).|$|E
5|$|Rhodotus palmatus is saprobic, {{meaning it}} obtains {{nutrients}} from decomposing organic matter. It grows scattered or clustered {{in small groups}} on rotting hardwoods, such as basswood, maple, and especially elm; in Europe it is known to grow on horse chestnut. The mushroom prefers low-lying logs {{in areas that are}} periodically flooded and that receive little sunlight, such as areas shaded by <b>forest</b> <b>canopy.</b> A pioneer species in the fungal colonization of dead wood, it prefers to grow on relatively undecayed substrates. It is often found growing on dark-stained wood, especially the dried-out upper parts of trunks that have lost their bark. R. palmatus tends to fruit in cooler and moister weather, from spring to autumn in the United States, or autumn to winter in Britain and Europe.|$|E
5|$|Settlers cleared {{much of the}} Catlins' coastal {{vegetation}} for farmland, but in {{some areas}} the original coastal plant life survives, primarily around cliff edges {{and some of the}} bays close to the Tautuku Peninsula, these being furthest from the landward edges of the forest. Plant life here includes many native species adapted to the strong salt-laden winds found in this exposed region. The Catlins coastal daisy (Celmisia lindsayii) is unique to the region, and is related to New Zealand's mountain daisies. Tussocks, hebes, and flaxes are common, as are native gentians, though sadly the endangered native sedge pingao can now rarely be found. In years when the southern rātā flowers well, the coastal <b>forest</b> <b>canopy</b> turns bright red. The rātā also thrives in some inland areas.|$|E

40|$|In {{modeling}} <b>forest</b> <b>canopies,</b> several {{scattering mechanisms}} {{are taken into}} account: 1) volume scattering, 2) surface-volume interaction, and 3) surface scattering from forest floor. Depending on the structural and dielectric characteristics of <b>forest</b> <b>canopies,</b> the relative contribution of each mechanism in the total backscatter signal of an imaging radar can vary. In this paper, two commonly used first order discrete scattering models, Distorted Born Approximation (DBA) and Radiative Transfer (RT) are used to simulate the backscattered power received by polarimetric radars at P-, L-, and C-bands over coniferous and deciduous forests. The {{difference between the two}} models resides on the coherent effect in the surface-volume interaction terms...|$|R
5|$|Cockroaches {{occupy a}} wide range of habitats. Many live in leaf litter, among the stems of matted vegetation, in rotting wood, in holes in stumps, in {{cavities}} under bark, under log piles and among debris. Some live in arid regions and have developed mechanisms to survive without access to water sources. Others are aquatic, living near the surface of water bodies, including bromeliad phytotelmata, and diving to forage for food. Most of these respire by piercing the water surface with the tip of the abdomen which acts as a snorkel, but some carry a bubble of air under their thoracic shield when they submerge. Others live in the <b>forest</b> <b>canopy</b> where they {{may be one of the}} main types of invertebrate present. Here they may hide during the day in crevices, among dead leaves, in bird and insect nests or among epiphytes, emerging at night to feed.|$|E
5|$|In natural settings, {{the black}} vulture eats mainly carrion. In areas {{populated}} by humans, it may scavenge at garbage dumps, but also takes eggs and decomposing plant material and can kill or injure newborn or incapacitated mammals. Like other vultures, it {{plays an important}} role in the ecosystem by disposing of carrion which would otherwise be a breeding ground for disease. The black vulture locates food either by sight or by following New World vultures of the genus Cathartes to carcasses. These vultures—the turkey vulture, the lesser yellow-headed vulture, and the greater yellow-headed vulture—forage by detecting the scent of ethyl mercaptan, a gas produced by the beginnings of decay in dead animals. Their heightened ability to detect odors allows them to search for carrion below the <b>forest</b> <b>canopy.</b> The black vulture is aggressive when feeding, and may chase the slightly larger turkey vulture from carcasses.|$|E
5|$|During the {{regrowth}} of {{pine trees}} after disturbance like clearcutting or wildfire, there appears an orderly sequence of mycorrhizal fungi as one species {{is replaced by}} another. A study on the ecological succession of ectomycorrhizal fungi in Canadian jack pine forests following wildfire concluded that S.brevipes is a multi-stage fungus. It appears relatively early during tree development; fruit bodies were common in 6-year-old tree stands, and the fungus colonized the highest proportion of root tips. The fungus persists throughout {{the life of the}} tree, having been found in tree stands that were 41, 65, and 122 years old. There is, however, a relative reduction in the prevalence of the fungus with increasing stand age, which may be attributed to increased competition from other fungi, and a change in habitat brought about by closure of the <b>forest</b> <b>canopy.</b> Generally, S.brevipes responds favorably to silvicultural practices such as thinning and clearcutting. A 1996 study demonstrated that fruit bodies increased in abundance as the severity of disturbance increased. It has been suggested that the thick-walled, wiry rhizomorphs produced by the fungus may serve as an adaptation that helps it to survive and remain viable {{for a period of time}} following disturbance.|$|E
