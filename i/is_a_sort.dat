5|$|The {{most popular}} kind of coral kept is soft coral, {{especially}} zoanthids and mushroom corals, which are especially {{easy to grow}} and propagate {{in a wide variety}} of conditions, because they originate in enclosed parts of reefs where water conditions vary and lighting may be less reliable and direct. More serious fishkeepers may keep small polyp stony coral, which is from open, brightly lit reef conditions and therefore much more demanding, while large polyp stony coral <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of compromise between the two.|$|E

25|$|Selah {{is used in}} Iyaric Rastafarian vocabulary. It can {{be heard}} {{at the end of}} spoken-word {{segments}} of some reggae songs. Its usage here, again, is to accentuate the magnitude and importance of what has been said, and often <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of substitute for Amen. Notable, according to Rastafarian faith, is also the word's similarity with the incarnated god and savior Selassie (Ethiopia's former emperor Haile Selassie).|$|E

Her mission was to help train the Senegalese National Ballet and to assist President Leopold Senghor with arrangements for the First Pan-African World Festival of Negro Arts in Dakar (1965–66). Later she established a second home in Senegal and occasionally returned there to scout for talented African musicians and dancers.|$|E

25|$|De Reis van Sint Brandaen (Dutch for The Voyage of Saint Brandan) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of a Christianized Odyssey, {{written in}} the 12th century that {{describes}} the legend of Sint Brandaen, a monk from Galway, and his voyage {{around the world for}} nine years. Scholars believe the Dutch legend derived from a now lost middle High German text combined with Celtic elements from Ireland and combines Christian and fairy tale elements. The journey was begun as a punishment by an angel. The angel saw Brandaen did not believe the truth of a book on the miracles of creation and saw Brandaen throw it into the fire. The angel tells him that truth has been destroyed. On his journeys Brandaen encounters the wonders and horrors of the world, people in distant lands with swine heads, dog legs and wolf teeth carrying bows and arrows, and an enormous fish that encircles the ship by holding its tail in its mouth. The English poem Life of Saint Brandan is an English derivative.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, Callas told Lord Harewood, De Hildalgo had {{the real}} great {{training}}, {{maybe even the}} last real training of the real bel canto. As a young girl—thirteen years old—I was immediately thrown into her arms, meaning that I learned the secrets, the ways of this bel canto, which of course as you well know, is not just beautiful singing. It is a very hard training; it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of a strait-jacket that you're supposed to put on, {{whether you like it}} or not. You have to learn to read, to write, to form your sentences, how far you can go, fall, hurt yourself, put yourself back on your feet continuously. De Hidalgo had one method, which was the real bel canto way, where no matter how heavy a voice, it should always be kept light, it should always be worked on in a flexible way, never to weigh it down. It is a method of keeping the voice light and flexible and pushing the instrument into a certain zone where it might not be too large in sound, but penetrating. And teaching the scales, trills, all the bel canto embellishments, which is a whole vast language of its own.|$|E

He would go to bed at 12:30 am after saying a prayer. [...] "Quite a good prayer, unselfish too", he told the Sunday Times.

500|$|At the time, it {{was almost}} {{unprecedented}} for a film trailer to not actually feature anything of the film itself; and while Citizen Kane is frequently cited as a ground-breaking, influential film, Simon Callow argues its trailer was no less original in its approach. Callow writes that it has [...] "great playful charm... it is a miniature documentary, almost {{an introduction to the}} cinema... Teasing, charming, completely original, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of conjuring trick: without his face appearing once on the screen, Welles entirely dominates its five [...] minutes' duration." ...|$|E

In [...] "Al Aaraaf", Poe was probably {{less interested in}} the Qur'an itself and more interested {{in an atmosphere of}} the exotic or otherworldliness. The true setting of the poem <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of dreamscape or alternative world. As critic Floyd Stovall wrote, the theme of the poem is [...] "one of disillusionment with the world and escape into some more congenial realm of dream or of the imagination".|$|E
500|$|As Adams {{worked on}} the opera, {{he came to see}} Nixon, whom he had once {{intensely}} disliked, as an [...] "interesting character", a complicated individual who sometimes showed emotion in public. [...] Adams wanted Mao to be [...] "the Mao of the huge posters and Great Leap Forward; I cast him as a heldentenor". [...] Mao's wife, on the other hand, was to be [...] "not just a shrieking coloratura, but also someone who in the opera's final act can reveal her private fantasies, her erotic desires, and even a certain tragic awareness. [...] Nixon himself <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of Simon Boccanegra, a self-doubting, lyrical, at times self-pitying melancholy baritone." ...|$|E

Sometimes I stayed a beat longer on a take to get that little sparkle in their eyes... You can {{see a lot of}} playfulness in the quick cuts back and forth when they are teasing each other, but then there are also certain moments that Vera would give a little raise of an eyebrow, or George would give the same thing. Those tiny nuances are really helpful to show their character and show what they are after." ...|$|E
