5|$|Although the {{breakout}} crew in {{the weapons}} storage began {{to inspect the}} missiles, an early-arriving transport crew hooked up the pylons and towed them away without inspecting or ensuring that the missiles had been inspected or cleared <b>for</b> <b>removal.</b> The munitions control center failed to verify that the pylon had received proper clearance and inspection and approved the pylon for loading on the B-52 at 0925. After taking eight hours to attach the pylons, the aircraft with the missiles loaded then remained parked overnight at Minot for 15 hours without the special guard required for nuclear weapons.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} indicates that materialistic {{women are more likely}} to want to alter their bodies (Henderson-King 2 ̆ 6 Brooks, 2009). This study focuses specifically on the relationship between materialism and body hair removal. We collected information about the frequency of body hair <b>removal,</b> reasons <b>for</b> hair <b>removal,</b> and materialism (Richins 2 ̆ 6 Dawson, 1992). Findings indicate that males and females do not significantly differ on materialist values. Correlational analyses reveal that for women, materialism is related to frequency of hair <b>removal</b> <b>for</b> several body sites; for men, however, materialism was related to body hair <b>removal</b> <b>for</b> only a single site. Qualitative analyses reveal that men who are more materialistic also report fewer health-related (intrinsic) reasons <b>for</b> hair <b>removal.</b> <b>For</b> women who are more materialistic, analyses reveal that they provide more normative (extrinsic) reasons <b>for</b> hair <b>removal...</b>|$|R
5|$|Americium is an {{artificial}} element of recent origin, and thus {{does not have}} a biological requirement. It is harmful to life. It has been proposed to use bacteria <b>for</b> <b>removal</b> of americium and other heavy metals from rivers and streams. Thus, Enterobacteriaceae of the genus Citrobacter precipitate americium ions from aqueous solutions, binding them into a metal-phosphate complex at their cell walls. Several studies have been reported on the biosorption and bioaccumulation of americium by bacteria and fungi.|$|E
5|$|Bryant died on January 6, 1936, {{of a brain}} {{hemorrhage}} in Sèvres, in {{the suburbs}} of Paris, and is buried in Cimetière des Gonards in Versailles. In 1998, three volunteers from the Oregon Cultural Heritage Commission went to Paris to find the grave, which they discovered was crumbling, undated, and scheduled <b>for</b> <b>removal.</b> Through the commission's efforts as well as donations, including some from relatives of Bryant and Bullitt, the grave was restored.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} 19thcentury, the Oregon Trail, a pioneer trail {{of which a}} major portion {{followed}} the Snake River, had been established by aspiring settlers and traders. Steamboats and railroads moved agricultural products and minerals along the river throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries. The powerful, steep flow of the Snake River has been used since the 1890s to generate hydroelectricity, enhance navigation, and provide irrigation water from fifteen major dams built on the lower river, transforming it {{into a series of}} reservoirs. Several of these have been proposed <b>for</b> <b>removal</b> in order to restore some of the river's once-tremendous salmon runs.|$|E
30|$|Similarly, {{a number}} of {{adsorbents}} are {{reported in the literature}} <b>for</b> the <b>removal</b> of dyes from the effluent of industries. Azo dyes are the primary class of dyes, having {{a number of}} industrial applications. Various adsorbents are utilized <b>for</b> the <b>removal</b> of these azo dyes from the industrial effluents, e.g. functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (f-MWCNTs) have been applied for the adsorption and decolourization of three different azoic dyes viz. Direct Congo Red, Reactive Green HE 4 BD and Golden Yellow MR dyes [28], magnetic-modified multi-walled carbon nanotubes have been employed <b>for</b> the <b>removal</b> of Crystal Violet (CV), Thionine (Th), Janus Green B (JG), and Methylene Blue (MB) dyes [29], two bamboo-derived carbons BACX 2 and BACX 6 <b>for</b> the <b>removal</b> of a large reactive dye and Reactive Black 5 [28]. Previous studies have also reported the use of different waste materials <b>for</b> the <b>removal</b> of dyes [4, 30, 31, 32, 33].|$|R

30|$|The paper {{industries}} {{produce a}} large amount of sludge every year, which can be used as an adsorbent <b>for</b> the <b>removal</b> of dyes. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the potential use of CMSW <b>for</b> the <b>removal</b> of hazardous dye Rhodamine B.|$|R
5|$|During its 2002 annual session, the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) added 14 {{amendments}} to the Constitution of Indonesia. Included in these amendments were measures to reorganize the legislature. Beginning in 2004, the MPR was composed of the existing People's Representative Council (DPR) and a new Regional Representative Council (DPD). Because all {{the seats in the}} MPR were directly elected, this called <b>for</b> <b>removal</b> of the military from the legislature, whose 38 seats in the Assembly were appointed. This change and an amendment for direct election of the President and Vice President were major steps for Indonesia on the road towards a full democracy.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, Wisconsin {{achieved}} statehood; Indian {{nations were}} under increased pressure <b>for</b> <b>removal</b> and marginalization. Corrupt US Indian agents controlled annuity payments, sometimes underpaying tribes, and took authority not granted {{them by the}} bands. They allowed white settlers to move onto Ojibwa lands and refused the Ojibwe the rights reserved by treaties. The Ojibwa complained to the President about the mistreatment and broken promises, but politicians were more apt to listen to western land speculators, who saw possibilities for profit in removing the Ojibwa to Minnesota.|$|E
5|$|On March 2, she {{was told}} that her request <b>for</b> <b>removal</b> of POI status—which entailed among other things {{sleeping}} wearing only boxer shorts—had been denied. Her lawyer said Manning joked to the guards that, {{if she wanted to}} harm herself, she could do so with her underwear or her flip-flops. The comment resulted in Manning being ordered to strip naked in her cell that night and sleep without clothing. On the following morning only, Manning stood naked for inspection. Following her lawyer's protest and media attention, Manning was issued a sleeping garment on or before March 11.|$|E
30|$|There are {{a number}} of {{adsorbents}} reported in the literature which are used for the adsorption of multiple metal ions from wastewater. Some of the examples are the functioned Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) and activated neem bark for the adsorption of a toxic hexavalent chromium ion [7, 19], carbon nanotube along with magnesium oxide form composite <b>for</b> the <b>removal</b> of Pb(II) [20], fertilizer wastes to adsorb multiple metal ions [21], alumina-coated carbon nanotubes <b>for</b> the Pb(II) <b>removal</b> [22], nickel oxide <b>for</b> the <b>removal</b> of Zn(II), Co(II) and Cd(II) [23], orange peel <b>for</b> the cadmium <b>removal</b> [24], humic acid (HA) for Cu(II) and Zn(II) from aqueous solution [25], zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO) for the adsorption of Zn(II), Cd(II) and Hg(II) [26], clay minerals in surficial sediment samples <b>for</b> the <b>removal</b> of Cu(II) and Zn(II) [27].|$|R
30|$|However, {{the major}} {{drawback}} {{of these materials}} is nonselective adsorption of acid dyes. Several amine based polymeric compounds were used <b>for</b> the <b>removal</b> of acid dyes. Amine based natural compounds like chitosan and crosslinked chitosan (Saha et al. 2005), ammonium chitosan derivative (Elwakeel et al. 2012) and synthetic polymers like MCM- 41, polyaniline (PANI) were used <b>for</b> <b>removals</b> of sulfonated reactive and acid dyes (Qin et al. 2009; Donia et al. 2009; Mahanta et al. 2009; Ahmad and Kumar 2010).|$|R
30|$|A {{literature}} review shows {{that only a}} few works on burned root of E. crassipes have been reported, otherwise most of the studies <b>for</b> CR <b>removal</b> have been conducted by simple biosorbent. The higher equilibrium uptake capacity of CR makes the adsorbent attractive <b>for</b> CR <b>removal</b> filter units. Therefore, the CR uptake capacity on BREC is compared with previously reported other adsorbents (Table  4). The results show the applicability of BREC <b>for</b> the <b>removal</b> of CR from aqueous solutions using a significance study.|$|R

5|$|Another area {{of concern}} is California, where {{recovery}} began to fluctuate or decline in the late 1990s. Unusually high mortality rates amongst adult and subadult otters, particularly females, have been reported. In 2017 the US Geological Survey found a 3% drop in the sea otter population of the California coast. This number still keeps them on track <b>for</b> <b>removal</b> from the endangered species list, although just barely. Necropsies of dead sea otters indicate diseases, particularly Toxoplasma gondii and acanthocephalan parasite infections, are major causes of sea otter mortality in California. The Toxoplasma gondii parasite, which is often fatal to sea otters, is carried by wild and domestic cats and may be transmitted by domestic cat droppings flushed into the ocean via sewage systems. Although disease has clearly contributed {{to the deaths of}} many of California's sea otters, it is not known why the California population is apparently more affected by disease than populations in other areas.|$|E
5|$|In Chile, the Socialist Party {{candidate}} Salvador Allende won {{the presidential}} election of 1970, becoming the first democratically elected Marxist {{to become president of}} a country in the Americas. The CIA targeted Allende <b>for</b> <b>removal</b> and operated to undermine his support domestically, which contributed to a period of unrest culminating in General Augusto Pinochet's coup d'état on 11 September 1973. Pinochet consolidated power as a military dictator, Allende's reforms of the economy were rolled back, and leftist opponents were killed or detained in internment camps under the Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional (DINA). The Pinochet regime would go on {{to be one of the}} leading participants in Operation Condor, an international campaign of political assassination and state terrorism organized by right-wing military dictatorships in the Southern Cone of South America that was covertly supported by the US government.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the California {{sea lion}} is {{protected}} {{on the federal}} Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), passed in 1972, which outlaws hunting, killing, capture, and harassment of the animal.

5|$|Song scholar-officials {{were granted}} ranks, honors, and career {{appointments}} {{on the basis}} of merit, the standards of which were codified and more objective than those in the Tang dynasty. The anonymity of exam candidates guarded against fraud and favoritism by those who could judge papers based upon handwriting and/or signature calligraphy; a bureau of copyists was tasked with the job of recopying all the candidates' papers before grading. After passing the prefectural, provincial, and then palace exam (the most prestigious), scholarly degrees did not immediately ensure an appointment to office, but the more prestigious the degree, the more certain one's career in higher administrative posts would be. The central government held the exclusive right to appoint or remove officials. The case <b>for</b> <b>removal</b> was always carefully examined, since the central government kept a recorded dossier of reports on each official, stored in the capital for later review.|$|E
5|$|The Governor {{appoints}} {{almost all}} military and civil {{officers of the}} State government, subject to advice and consent of the Maryland State Senate.
