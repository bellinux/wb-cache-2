5|$|WIN became {{regional}} Western Australia's second {{commercial television}} network on 26 March 1999 after winning rights in 1997. Prior to {{the launch of}} the new station, GWN held a commercial monopoly on the market. GWN became an affiliate of the Seven Network, while WIN took a combination of Nine Network and Network Ten programming. Despite the Nine Network's traditional ratings dominance throughout most of the country, GWN has remained the market's most-watched station. The second ratings survey of 2006 placed WIN Television with a 34.7% commercial audience share <b>in</b> <b>prime</b> <b>time,</b> compared to the Golden West Network with 65.3%, thus being no.2 among regional viewers.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the show}} was a bigger hit <b>in</b> <b>prime</b> <b>time,</b> Moore always {{preferred}} the daytime housewife audience. He thought that it gave the lonely housewives something to listen to and watch while they worked. The show provided a break into show business for many performers, including Alan King, Jonathan Winters, Carol Burnett, and Dorothy Loudon. The Garry Moore Show featured regular supporting cast members Durward Kirby, Marion Lorne, Denise Lor, and Ken Carson, {{as well as a}} mixture of song-and-dance routines and comedy skits, and introduced the public to comedian Carol Burnett. After the show ended, Burnett became a star in her own right, hosting The Carol Burnett Show for many years.|$|E
5|$|In November 2010, the PTC {{released}} a study, Habitat for Profanity: Broadcast TV's Sharp Increase in Foul Language, which claims {{that there was}} a sharp rise in the usage of profanity between 2005 and 2010—during the 8PM to 9PM ET/PT time period commonly referred to them as the Family Viewing Hour, the PTC claimed that there were 111 instances of profanity during this hour in 2010 versus 10 in 2005; during all of prime time, 276 instances in 2010 against 11 in 2005. The study claimed {{that there was a}} 69.3% increase <b>in</b> <b>prime</b> <b>time</b> in general between 2005 and 2010, with the Fox network being heavily accused of bringing a 269% increase for the network during that period.

5|$|The match {{took place}} in Reykjavík from July to September 1972 {{and was the first}} to receive an American {{broadcast}} <b>in</b> <b>prime</b> <b>time.</b> Fischer lost the first two games in strange fashion: the first when he played a risky pawn-grab in a drawn endgame, the second by forfeit when he refused to play the game in a dispute over playing conditions. Fischer would likely have forfeited the entire match, but Spassky, not wanting to win by default, yielded to Fischer's demands to move the next game to a back room, away from the cameras whose presence had upset Fischer. After that game, the match was moved back to the stage and proceeded without further serious incident. Fischer won seven of the next 19 games, losing only one and drawing eleven, to win the match 12½–8½ and become the 11th World Chess Champion.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the game}} {{involved}} two Canadian teams, the NHL {{hoped that the}} event would prove a successful draw in the U.S. To that end, the league scheduled the Heritage Classic as the only game <b>in</b> <b>prime</b> <b>time,</b> while NBC debuted its Hockey Day in America {{with a pair of}} regional doubleheaders that led into the telecast; throughout NBC's telecast, commercials advised viewers to change to Versus for the Heritage Classic once the American games finished. University of Alberta sports economist Brad Humphreys questioned the league's ambitions, arguing that a game without an American team would not appeal. He stated that the game was being held to placate the Canadian audience, but noted that it was important for the NHL to keep the league's Canadian audience happy.|$|E

25|$|Had the 1984 ALCS {{between the}} Detroit Tigers and Kansas City Royals gone the full five games (the {{last year that}} the League Championship Series was a best-of-five series), Game 5 on Sunday October 7, {{would have been a}} 1 p.m. ET time start instead of being <b>in</b> <b>prime</b> <b>time.</b> This would have {{happened}} because one of the presidential debates between Ronald Reagan and Walter Mondale was scheduled for that night. In return, ABC was going to broadcast the debates instead of a baseball game <b>in</b> <b>prime</b> <b>time.</b> Al Trautwig interviewed the Detroit Tigers from their clubhouse following their pennant clinching victory in Game 3.|$|E
