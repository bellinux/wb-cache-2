There are several developments for grinding wheels and methods for determining optimum grinding parameters which enable good surface properties to be obtained. Another potential to achieve better surface quality for dry grinding is the intentional change in process kinematics. This change makes it possible to carry out the task of cooling, namely lubrication of the contact area, and cooling and evacuation of the chips. This paper proposes innovative <b>face-grinding</b> kinematics in order to improve the surface properties for {{tool grinding}}. First, the principles of the new grinding kinematics are described and, second, a method for optimization of the process parameters is presented in order to assure the given surface requirements for the face grinding of inserts with high productivity...|$|E
