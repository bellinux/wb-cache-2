Her backing band features indigenous Peruvian instruments such as the cajón ("wooden box", whose origins lie in an upturned <b>fruit</b> <b>crate),</b> udu (clay pot), and quijada (jawbone of a burro) cheko a dried gourd, as well as acoustic guitar and electric upright baby bass. Although many of her songs are based on traditional forms such as the landó or vals, she also incorporates elements of Cuban and Brazilian music. Her debut CD for Luaka Bop, produced by Greg Landau, brought her to the attention of World Music audiences worldwide.|$|E
50|$|During World War II, in {{the period}} of the Italian Social Republic (or Salò Republic), three days after the Germans {{occupied}} Rome on 10 September 1943, Ferri bluffed his way back into the research facility at Guidonia, destroyed the vital equipment and filled a <b>fruit</b> <b>crate</b> with documents of his research before escaping underground. He secluded his wife and family near his home in Fiastra, in the Marche region of the Apennine Mountains (they later were moved on to an Adriatic fishing village), and in October 1943, organized with his brother, Giuseppe Ferri, the Banda Fiastra band of partisans.For the next year he coordinated attacks of the regions anti-fascist bands using the Valle del Fiastrone Valley as a safe haven to return to and to receive Allied air drops.|$|E
50|$|Orange Crate Art is a 1995 album by Brian Wilson and Van Dyke Parks {{released}} on Warner Bros. Records. The album's title {{refers to the}} sun-drenched, idealized paintings that grace wooden <b>fruit</b> <b>crates,</b> and its theme is a nostalgic view {{of the history of}} California.|$|R
25|$|When the garret room he {{occupied}} for {{the last}} {{three and a half years}} of his life was examined after his death, the walls were lined with stacks of <b>fruit</b> <b>crates</b> containing his extensive library and most of the floor was covered with packing crates full of most of a lifetime's artistic output.|$|R
50|$|In {{the second}} half of this Leg's Roadblock, one team member had to choose a marked cart with twelve <b>fruit</b> <b>crates</b> and deliver them using the cart to twelve marked stalls in the market, in {{exchange}} of a stamp. Once the team member had all 12 stamps, they would receive their next clue.|$|R
40|$|I want {{to invite}} {{speculation}} {{that some of}} the preoccupations with shimmer in modern and contemporary painting serve to quite literally deflect the kind of analysis that typically serves to access the meaning of modernist art. We find glimmer turned against analysis by writers we’d not normally associate with postmodernity like Virginia Woolf; or with Walter Benjamin’s concept of “aura;” or with Francis Ponge (for example, {{in the image of the}} gleaming fresh wood of the recently discarded <b>fruit</b> <b>crate</b> from the collection of prose poems titled Things). Such a gleam deflects attention away from author, away from the singular object or artwork to spread the gaze, if you like, onto the world around it. The work does this to diminish its singularity in favor of a place amongst other things and other kinds of thinking. This form of mirroring as deflection, or feint, takes other forms in late modernity. It’s not necessary for there to be a silver coating. I take Cage’s interest in silence, and 4 ’ 33 ” in particular, as deflecting concert listeners’ analytical assumptions by reflecting on that audience its own noise, and thereby turning inside out the relation of the scrutinizing subject to its object. This talk considers the function of op art, in particular by Victor Vasarely, to deflect attention away from the subject, or artist author, towards a world of vibrant matter (Jane Bennett) and lived concerns of human lives. A contemporary connection to Vasarely objective can be found in the aims of New York artists Tauba Auerbach and Donald Moffett to invite a sense of wonder and a condition desubjectivization at the material effects of paintings...|$|E

Matthew Higgs, another {{participant in the}} exhibition, invited him to stage an installation at White Columns in New York City. His White Columns exhibition in 2005 consisted of cardboard signs and labels, a clock, photographs and drawings based on photographs.|$|R
50|$|Since inception, the {{organization}} has significantly expanded its activities. In 1906, the CFGE launched the Citrus Protective League, a lobbying arm. In 1907, it formed the Fruit Growers Supply Company to supply growers with materials such as radios, tires, shooks for <b>fruit</b> <b>crates,</b> insecticides, and fertilizers at wholesale prices. It later formed the Sunkist's Exchange By-Products Company, which developed markets for products such as citric acid, sodium citrate, lemon oil, pectin, orange oil and orange pulp.|$|R
40|$|Edible {{films and}} {{coatings}} {{have been applied}} on fruit to reduce aromatic compounds and texture loss and to increase the barrier to transport of fats and solutes. Furthermore, the surface layer on the product can protect the <b>fruit</b> <b>crating</b> a modified atmosphere that by controls the O 2 and CO 2 exchange, reducing respiration rate, metabolism and, consequently, the senescence. A new potential application of this technology {{is the use of}} edible coatings and films as carriers of diverse food additives such as antioxidants and antimicrobial agents. This review discusses the incorporation of functional ingredients into the edible coatings and films and highlights of the recent advance in the search for these incorporations. The future trends for the study area are also presented...|$|R

5000|$|Ted - Ted is {{the guitarist}} for Truth Squad. Unlike the others, he is uptight about {{everything}} and feels very deeply {{about how their}} music is accepted and understood. He does not like doing covers, as this reminds him of their G-Flats wedding persona. So he helps to write [...] "The Potato Song", a song which he feels strongly about. During the novel, he works at a grocery store where he often brings home bruised but edible <b>fruit,</b> like <b>crates</b> of tangerines. In Just Listen, he and Owen are good friends.|$|R
50|$|Very thinly split timber is {{also called}} Spanholz or Span, {{roughly the same}} as long-fibred wood chips or wood shavings, which {{may also be a}} waste {{by-product}} of the processes of planning or hewing wood. Span may also refer, however, to long-fibred slices of wood especially of poplar and other softwoods, which are used to make wooden punnetes and <b>fruit</b> or vegetable <b>crates.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{the years}} before the Great Depression, Nashville was a prosperous, if small, town. According to author Dallas Tabor Herndon, Nashville was [...] "a banking town, with {{electric}} lights, waterworks, an ice and cold storage plant, a canning factory, foundries, machine shops, a flour mill, two newspapers, a brick factory, <b>fruit</b> box and <b>crate</b> factory, mercantile concerns... well-kept streets, and modern public schools." ...|$|R

A central conveyor belt moves along the right side, bringing fruit from outside the building. Men stand in the doorways on the left wall. Sunlight shines through the doorways and windows in the left and back walls...|$|R
25|$|As a young man, Marvil went to sea for a {{while and}} {{returned}} to work in shipbuilding. At age 28, in 1853, he began to manufacture farm equipment. Having a certain mechanical genius, he was able to imagine profitable new technologies. With the growth of the peach orchards, he started the Marvil Package Company, a basket and crate manufacturing business in Laurel. For a time, it was said to have been the largest industrial plant in the area, producing two million <b>fruit</b> baskets and <b>crates</b> annually. He was also the publisher of Laurel's first newspaper, the Gazette, which he started in 1889.|$|R
5000|$|Pier 3 was the {{terminal}} for Island Transportation Co., Merchants Transportation Co., Puget Sound Naval Station Route, Kitsap County Transportation Co., Pollard Steamship. Co., and other Puget Sound local shipping lines. [...] The Kitsap County Transportation Company, run by James Galbraith's son Walter Galbraith, competed against the Puget Sound Navigation Company {{running from the}} Colman Dock. As such it was home pier for wooden steamships such as the Kitsap, the Utopia, the Reliance and the Hyak. [...] Other Puget Sound steamers known to have called at Pier 3 included Magnolia, Mohawk, Florence K, Dode, and Monticello 2. [...] Pier 3 was {{within walking distance of}} Pike Place Market where much of the local groceries brought in by the steamers were sold. Typically this would have been done by the farmers themselves or their wives, who would ride the steamers into Pier 3 in the morning and depart in the evening. Live hens, slaughtered poultry, eggs, milk in galvanized cans, sacks of potatoes, rhubarb in bundles and <b>fruit</b> in <b>crates.</b> Dockside travel facilities offered few comforts then, but Pier 3 {{was one of the first}} to offer a small waiting room.|$|R
40|$|In food {{industry}} wooden pallet and <b>fruit</b> and vegetables <b>crates</b> {{are the most}} used for handling and delivering. Regulatory aspects and test procedure are relatively young as regards to the packaging sector of wooden. Currently many standards are in development or implementation. In this context {{the objective of the}} following paper is a brief overview on technical standards governing the use of wooden packaging, with particular reference to the agricultural-food sector. In this review, as wooden packaging, are taken into account, wood or its derivatives used to support, packaging and transport goods, such as cages, wooden pallets, wooden frame, wooden kegs, rods or timber. Particularly European standards are briefly described in their technical content and historic development. Market data, emerging technology and environmental problems are even recalled...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{main goal}} {{of this study is}} to design new and {{innovative}} packaging for agricultural products with the use of eco-friendly raw materials, processes and practises. The products considered in this study were local Greek produce like olive oil, tsipouro, raki, fruits and vegetables. These products are currently packaged in a very conventional way and it is generally recognised that the current packaging solutions do not reflect the quality of the produce or the ecological trends worldwide. The whole study was based on the use of Computer Aided Design programs and other digital technology. Glass and wood was used for the packaging of the fluid produce (olive oil, tsipouro and raki) and the raw material for the packaging solutions for the <b>fruits</b> and vegetables (<b>crates)</b> was olive tree pruning and wood wastes with the use of ecological glues. Other ecological aspects that were considered and utilised in the current proposal/study were 1. the re-use of the packaging. 2. the use of less raw material than current practises, 3. Ease of assembly and disassembly (separation) of materials...|$|R
