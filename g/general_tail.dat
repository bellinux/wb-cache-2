However, in {{functional programming}} languages, tail call elimination is often {{guaranteed by the}} language standard, allowing tail recursion to use a similar amount of memory as an equivalent loop. The special case of tail recursive calls, when a function calls itself, may be more amenable to call elimination than <b>general</b> <b>tail</b> calls. When the language semantics do not explicitly support <b>general</b> <b>tail</b> calls, a compiler can often still optimize sibling calls, or tail calls to functions which take and return the same types as the caller.|$|E
50|$|Implementing tail call {{elimination}} {{only for}} tail recursion, {{rather than for}} all tail calls, is something significantly easier. For example, in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), tail-recursive calls can be eliminated (as this reuses the existing call stack), but <b>general</b> <b>tail</b> calls cannot be (as this changes the call stack). As a result, functional languages such as Scala that target the JVM can efficiently implement direct tail recursion, but not mutual tail recursion.|$|E

These estimators measure tail dependence in different orthants, complementing the commonly studied positive (lower and upper) tail dependence. This approach {{is in line}} with the parametric analysis of <b>general</b> <b>tail</b> dependence. Under this unifying approach the different dependencies are analysed using the associated copulas. We generalise estimators of the lower and upper tail dependence coefficient to the general multivariate tail dependence function and study their statistical properties. Tail dependence measures come {{as a response to the}} incapability of the correlation coefficient as an extreme dependence measure. We run a Monte Carlo simulation study to assess the performance of the nonparametric estimators. We also employ selected estimators in two empirical applications to detect and measure the general multivariate non-positive tail dependence in financial data, which popular parametric copula models commonly applied in the financial literature fail to capture. 38 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Parametric {{modeling}} {{has long}} dominated both classical and Bayesian inference work. The restrictive assumptions regarding the underlying population(s) forced by common parametric families of distributions necessitate {{the development of}} more flexible models. Mixture distributions are very attractive in this regard. Dirichlet process mixed models form a particular class of Bayesian nonparametric mixture models that is becoming increasingly popular. Such models result by assuming a random mixing distribution, taken to be a realization from a Dirichlet process, for the mixture. Fitting of Dirichlet process mixed models is well established in the literature by now. However, inference for population functionals is limited to posterior expectations rendering them useful mainly in semiparametric settings. We first develop a computational method for obtaining the posterior of general functionals associated with the random mixture distribution arising through Dirichlet process mixing. Hence full inference is enabled under either semiparametric or fully nonparametric specifications, as we illustrate throughout the dissertation. The rest of the thesis is devoted to novel modeling approaches employing Dirichlet process mixed models. In the context of median regression modeling, an attractive alternative to mean regression from many respects, we propose and investigate the use of two flexible mixture models for the error distribution achieving increased variability, skewness and <b>general</b> <b>tail</b> behavior. We also consider the problem of nonparametric, or semiparametric modeling and inference for distribution functions subject to probability orderings constraints. Such order restrictions are often desirable in comparing two or more populations. The Bayesian paradigm provides a convenient framework for the development of related modeling since any probability order postulated a priori is preserved to the posterior analysis. Our approach handles the cases of stochastic order, the most common probability ordering, and variability order. ...|$|E

40|$|A copula is a {{flexible}} modeling tool which contributes substantially {{to the study}} of dependencies among random variables. A broad copula class with many nice properties is the Archimedean copula class. Usually, one works with the classical bivariate models, e. g. as summarized in Nelsen (2006), which are one-parametric models. However, in many cases when practitioners want to model dependencies by means of copulas, it would be more rational to work with multi-parametric models. Indeed, multi-parametric models would allow to better harmonize empirical information with the model, as {{it would be possible to}} directly import more than one characteristic into the model, e. g. measures of concordance, tail dependence and so on. Various ways exist and have been explored to define multi-parameter Archimedean models. This paper intends to elaborate on one particular method, namely the technique of transforms. More specifically, the contribution of this article is threefold: 1. Genest et al. (1998) sum up five feasible transformations applicable on the Archimedean generator '. In this note we present an overview of these transformations by generalizing tail dependence properties and limiting cases. 2. In an earlier paper, see Michiels et al. (2008), we showed that it can be advantageous to work with the -function instead of with the generator function. We investigate here the effect of transforms on this -function. 3. We introduce a new type of transform which is concordance invariant. As such, this type of transform has practical use as it allows to create comparable test spaces (see Michiels and De Schepper (2008)) from a particular copula family. The paper is organised as follows. In section two the most important copula properties are discussed, with the focus on the Archimedean class. Next, section three reviews generally known copula transforms and generator transforms. In section four the effect of the transforms on the -level is being discussed, which allows the derivation of <b>general</b> <b>tail</b> dependence properties and limiting cases. We also introduce a concordance invariant transform and illustrate its use through simulations. Finally, section five concludes. ...|$|E
40|$|The Sharpe {{ratio is}} one of the most widely used {{measures}} of the performance of an investment with respect to its return and risk. Since William Sharpe (1966) defined the ratio, as the funds excess return per unit of risk measured by standard deviation, investments have been often ranked and evaluated on the basis of Sharpe ratio by both private as well as institutional investors. Our study on Sharpe ratio estimator is focused on its finite sample statistical properties which have being given less attention in practice. Approximations aimed at improving the accuracy of likelihood method have been proposed over the past three decades. Among them, Lugannani and Rice (1980) and Barndorff-Nielsen (1986) introduced two widely used tail area approximations with third order of convergence. Furthermore, Fraser(1988; 1990), Fraser and Reid (1995), Fraser, Reid and Wu (1999) improved their methods and developed a <b>general</b> <b>tail</b> probability methodology, based on the tangent exponential model. The objective of this paper is to use the third order asymptotic likelihood-based statistical method to obtain highly accurate inference on Sharpe ratio. Since the methodology is demonstrated to work well generally for any parametric distribution, our study will assume the market log returns are independent identically distributed (IID) normal, or follow an autoregressive process of order one (AR(1)) with Gaussian white noise. While most literature address large sample properties of the Sharpe ratio statistic (Lo 2002, Mertens 2002, Christie 2005, Bailey and Lopez de Prado 2012); it is important to compare the performance of investments when only small sample observations are available, especially before and after markets change direction. Our research would address this issue. New tests are developed for testing hypothesis on the Sharpe ratio calculated from one sample and on the difference of two Sharpe ratios. Comparison between our method and the currently existing methods in the literature are conducted by simulations. The p-values and confidence intervals for Sharpe ratio are calculated and various applications are illustrated...|$|E
