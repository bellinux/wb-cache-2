Among 45 isolates, 20 isolates were classified as unidentified cyanobacteria and considered as novel cyanobacterial genera. Among 25 identified isolates, seven isolates were belonging <b>to</b> <b>order</b> Chroococcales, one <b>to</b> <b>order</b> Pleurocapsales, seven <b>to</b> <b>order</b> Oscillatoriales, six isolates <b>to</b> <b>order</b> Nostocales and four isolates <b>to</b> the <b>order</b> Stigonematales.

40|$|Recently, the Edgeworth {{expansion}} up <b>to</b> <b>order</b> 4 {{was used}} to represent the convolutional noise probability density function (pdf) in the conditional expectation calculations where the source pdf was modeled with the maximum entropy density approximation technique. However, the applied Lagrange multipliers were not the appropriate ones for the chosen model for the convolutional noise pdf. In this paper we use the Edgeworth expansion up <b>to</b> <b>order</b> 4 and up <b>to</b> <b>order</b> 6 <b>to</b> model the convolutional noise pdf. We derive the appropriate Lagrange multipliers, thus obtaining new closed-form approximated expressions for the conditional expectation and mean square error (MSE) as a byproduct. Simulation results indicate hardly any equalization improvement with Edgeworth expansion up <b>to</b> <b>order</b> 4 when using optimal Lagrange multipliers over a nonoptimal set. In addition, there is no justification for using the Edgeworth expansion up <b>to</b> <b>order</b> 6 over the Edgeworth expansion up <b>to</b> <b>order</b> 4 for the 16 QAM and easy channel case. However, Edgeworth expansion up <b>to</b> <b>order</b> 6 leads <b>to</b> improved equalization performance compared to the Edgeworth expansion up <b>to</b> <b>order</b> 4 for the 16 QAM and hard channel case {{as well as for}} the case where the 64 QAM is sent via an easy channel...|$|R
