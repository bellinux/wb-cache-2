He led the Wa Syndicate's 1901 expedition through the Gold Coast and the Upper Volta, looking for minerals and ways to improve river navigation. Between 1902 and 1904 he was employed by the East Africa Syndicate, for which he led a vast mineral prospecting expedition in the East Africa Protectorate (Kenya). Traveling <b>extensively</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area around Lake Rudolf (now Lake Turkana), he discovered a huge soda lake.|$|E
5|$|As well as hauling enthusiast {{specials}} in the United Kingdom, {{the locomotive}} toured <b>extensively</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States and Canada from 1969 until 1973 and Australia in 1988/89.

5|$|Because of the {{versatility}} of {{the process}} and the simplicity of its equipment and operation, shielded metal arc welding is one of the world's first and most popular welding processes. It dominates other welding processes in the maintenance and repair industry, and though flux-cored arc welding is growing in popularity, SMAW continues to be used <b>extensively</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> construction of heavy steel structures and in industrial fabrication. The process is used primarily to weld iron and steels (including stainless steel) but aluminium, nickel and copper alloys can also be welded with this method.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} of Graveyard Mountain Home was generally positive. Critics {{noted that the}} album was a departure from Moore's previous works, {{and that it was}} best experienced as an alternate soundtrack to Age 13. Moore played songs from Graveyard Mountain Home live {{for the first time in}} a small club in Istanbul in 2007, and planned to tour more <b>extensively</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future.|$|E
5|$|Homing pigeons {{were used}} <b>extensively</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 19th and early 20thcenturies, both for civil pigeon post and as war pigeons. In the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, the famous pigeon post of Paris carried up to 50,000microfilmed telegrams per pigeon flight from Tours into the besieged capital. Altogether 150,000 {{individual}} private telegrams and state dispatches were delivered. In an 1889 experiment of the Imperial Russian Technical Society at Saint Petersburg, {{the chief of}} the Russian balloon corps took aerial photographs from a balloon and sent the developed collodion film negatives to the ground by pigeon post.|$|E

5|$|In 1853, a new route named Seminoe cutoff was {{established}} {{on the southern}} side of the river. It was named after trapper Basil LaJeunesse who {{was referred to as}} Seminoe by the Shoshone Indians. The Seminoe cutoff split from the main trail at the 6th crossing and rejoined it at Burnt Ranch, bypassing both Rocky Ridge and four of the river crossings, which was an advantage in the early spring and summer during high runoff. The route was used <b>extensively</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1850s, especially by the Mormon companies.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{kauri gum}} {{was found to}} mix more easily with linseed oil, at lower temperatures, than other resins, by the 1890s, 70 percent of all oil {{varnishes}} made in England used kauri gum. It was used to a limited extent in paints during the late 19th century, and from 1910 was used <b>extensively</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> manufacture of linoleum. From the 1930s, the market for gum dropped as synthetic alternatives were found, but there remained niche uses for the gum in jewellery and specialist high-grade varnish for violins.|$|E
5|$|The Amfleets {{were the}} first new locomotive-hauled {{intercity}} cars ordered by Amtrak and the first such cars built in the United States since 1965. Their introduction in the mid-1970s led to improved reliability for Amtrak's trains and ridership gains. As of 2015, Amfleet cars are used <b>extensively</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eastern and mid-western United States, forming the backbone of Amtrak's single-level fleet.|$|E

5|$|The {{triploid}} {{onion is}} a hybrid species with {{three sets of}} chromosomes, two sets from A. cepa and the third set from an unknown parent. Various clones of the triploid onion are grown locally in different regions, such as 'Ljutika' in Croatia, and 'Pran', 'Poonch', and 'Srinagar' in the India-Kashmir region. 'Pran' is grown <b>extensively</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northern Indian provinces of Jammu and Kashmir. There are very small genetic differences between 'Pran' and the Croatian clone 'Ljutika', implying a monophyletic origin for this species.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{arrival at}} VÃ¶rden the first {{aircraft}} credited to I./JG 1 was a Bristol Blenheim of No. 110 Squadron RAF shot {{down on a}} reconnaissance mission. In February 1940, Major Bernhard Woldenga was promoted {{to the position of}} Inspectorate of Fighters and was succeeded by Joachim Schlichting. The unit went on to participate <b>extensively</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Battle of France. I./JG 1 claimed 82 air victories during the Battle of France, with Hauptmann Wilhelm Balthasar top scorer with 23 kills, and Leutnant Ludwig Frantisek with 9.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture {{formed the}} bulk of the English economy {{at the time of the}} Norman invasion. Twenty years after the invasion, 35% of England was covered in arable land, 25% was put to pasture, 15% was covered by {{woodlands}} and the remaining 25% was predominantly moorland, fens and heaths. Wheat formed the single most important arable crop, but rye, barley and oats were also cultivated <b>extensively.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> more fertile parts of the country, such as the Thames valley, the Midlands and the east of England, legumes and beans were also cultivated. Sheep, cattle, oxen and pigs were kept on English holdings, although most of these breeds were much smaller than modern equivalents and most would have been slaughtered in winter.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{transition}} of the young bands from being local attractions to touring <b>extensively</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK, major record labels' A agents still did not recognise the rising new trend. Thus, most new bands signed contracts with small independent labels, which could afford only limited printings of singles and albums and usually offered only national distribution. Many other bands, including Iron Maiden, Def Leppard and Diamond Head, self-produced their first releases and sold them through mail order or at concerts. Saxon {{were the first to}} sign with an internationally distributed label, the French Carrere Records, followed by Def Leppard with Phonogram in August 1979, and Iron Maiden with EMI in December 1979. In early 1980, EMI tested the market with the Neal Kay-compiled album Metal for Muthas and a UK tour of the bands that had contributed to the compilation, eventually signing Angel Witch (who were dropped after the release of their first single) and Ethel the Frog.|$|E
5|$|Federal {{examiners}} had {{the authority}} to register voters, examine voter registration applications, and maintain voter rolls. The goal of the federal examiner provision was to prevent jurisdictions from denying protected minorities the right to vote by engaging in discriminatory behavior in the voter registration process, such as refusing to register qualified applicants, purging qualified voters from the voter rolls, and limiting the hours during which persons could register. Federal examiners were used <b>extensively</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> years following the Act's enactment, but their importance waned over time; 1983 was the last year that a federal examiner registered a person to vote. In 2006, Congress repealed the provision.|$|E
5|$|Horses {{first arrived}} on the {{southeast}} North American mainland in 1521, brought by Ponce de Leon on his second trip to the region, where they were used by officers, scouts and livestock herders. Later expeditions brought more horses and cattle to Spanish Florida. By the late 16th century, horses were used <b>extensively</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> local cattle business and by the late 17th century the industry was flourishing, especially {{in what is now}} northern Florida and southern Georgia. The horses brought to North America by the Spanish and subsequently bred there included Barbs, Garranos, Spanish Jennets, Sorraias, Andalusians and other Iberian breeds. Overall, they were relatively small and had physical traits distinctive of Spanish breeds, including short backs, sloping shoulders, low set tails and wide foreheads.|$|E
