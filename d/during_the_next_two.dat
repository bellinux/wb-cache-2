By the US Presidential {{election in}} 1980, that number had increased to 1,000 active clubs, helping Reagan win 98 of 105 mock elections and recruiting thousands of voters. This success led to $290,000 in financial {{assistance from the}} RNC, mainly to implement Jack Abramoff's field representative program. Abramoff's fund-raising efforts brought in an additional $1,160,000 <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>two</b> years. By 1983, only 10% of the CRNC's budget came from the RNC.|$|E

En route to that Euro appearance, their first, they eliminated reigning European champions Italy by winning the two-legged play-offs on aggregate. At the end stage, they finished third by winning the consolation match against Hungary. In 1973, the denial of a match-winning goal in their last 1974 FIFA World Cup qualification game for UEFA Group 3 cost Belgium their appearance at the finals, causing Belgium to become the only nation ever to miss a World Cup final round despite not allowing a goal <b>during</b> <b>the</b> qualifiers. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>two</b> attempts to reach a major finals were also fruitless.|$|R
50|$|The dam {{is part of}} the Kodiyar Irrigation System, as its stored {{waters are}} {{utilized}} only through a combined canal system which provides irrigation to a total command area of 36836 ha. The irrigation system consists of four dams and associated storage reservoirs, anicuts, and canal system. The first project to be implemented under this system was the Pechiparai dam, built <b>during</b> 1948-53; <b>the</b> Kodiyar Left Bank Canal (KLBC) taking off from this dam feeds the Puthen dam, which is a weir that was remodeled under World Bank assistance <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 2000s. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>two</b> dams to be built were the Chittar dam I and Chittar dam II in the period from 1964-1970; the storage waters of these two reservoirs were also fed into the KLBC.

By lap 22, Michael Schumacher had increased his lead over Häkkinen to eleven seconds. Ralf Schumacher, ten seconds behind Häkkinen, maintained a six-second gap over teammate Button. Michael Schumacher made a pit stop on that lap, emerging in third position. On lap 23 Barrichello passed Herbert for ninth position, and <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>two</b> laps Villeneuve and Ralf Schumacher made pit stops. Button made a pit stop from fourth position on lap 26, and Häkkinen one lap later; Häkkinen was told by his team (on pit boards) to speed up to reduce the gap to Michael Schumacher, who had a heavier fuel load. Button dropped to eighth position, and Häkkinen came out behind Michael Schumacher. Frentzen and Coulthard made their pit stops together on lap 28, with Coulthard emerging ahead of Frentzen. On that lap, Barrichello passed Alesi for sixth position. Barrichello, setting the fastest lap of the race (1:53.803 on lap 30), had consecutive fastest laps before making his second pit stop on lap 31. However, his car's fuel pressure dropped and he was pushed by marshals into the pit lane. Barrichello and Alesi (who had a similar problem) retired, and Button inherited fourth place. Salo was the final scheduled driver to make a pit stop, on lap 33.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Wisconsin, Linde first played professionally with the Green Bay Bluejays.

The Kings suffered second round eliminations in the playoffs to the Oilers in 1990 and 1991 while losing in the first round in 1992. In 1993, the Oilers failed to make the playoffs, after being eliminated by a 5-1 loss to the Kings who were without Gretzky for {{a significant part of the}} regular season.|$|R

5|$|In 1902 Bondfield met Mary Macarthur, some {{eight years}} her junior, {{who chaired the}} Ayr branch of NAUSAWC. Macarthur, the {{daughter}} of a wealthy Scottish draper, had held staunchly Conservative views until a works meeting in 1901 to discuss the formation of a NAUSAWC branch transformed her into an ardent trades unionist. In 1903 Macarthur moved to London where, with Bondfield's recommendation, she became secretary of the Women's Trade Union League. The two became close comrades-in-arms <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>two</b> decades, in a range of causes affecting women. The historian Lise Sanders suggests that Bondfield's more intimate friendships tended to be with women rather than men; Bondfield's biographer Mary Hamilton described Macarthur as the romance of Bondfield's life.|$|E
5|$|The Platine War {{ended in}} 1852 with the Allied {{victory at the}} Battle of Caseros, for some time {{establishing}} Brazilian hegemony over much of South America. The war ushered a period {{of economic and political}} stability in the Empire of Brazil. With Rosas gone, Argentina began a political process which would result in a more unified state. However, the end of the Platine war did not completely resolve issues within the Platine region. Turmoil continued in subsequent years, with internal disputes among political factions in Uruguay, a long civil war in Argentina, and an emergent Paraguay asserting its claims. Two more major international wars (see:Paraguayan War) followed <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>two</b> decades, sparked by territorial ambitions and conflicts over influence.|$|E

5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>two</b> seasons Liverpool {{consolidated}} {{their place}} in the First Division, with fifth and ninth-place finishes. Performances improved in the 1898–99 season, when the club went into their final game with a chance of winning their first League championship. They faced Aston Villa, with whom they were level on points, although Villa's goal average advantage of 0.02 meant that they only needed to draw the match to win the League title. In the event, Villa won 5–0, to leave Liverpool as the runners-up. Liverpool also reached the FA Cup semi-final, where they faced Sheffield United. The match finished in a 2–2 draw; the first replay at Burnden Park also finished with the sides equal at 4–4, and a second replay at the small Fallowfield Stadium was abandoned when overcrowding caused fans to spill onto the pitch. The tie was finally decided at the Baseball Ground, which Sheffield United won 1–0.|$|E
5|$|Early on September 27, 1976, the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center (EPHC) {{reported}} that a tropical disturbance had formed about 770km (480mi) to the southwest of San Jose, Costa Rica. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>two</b> days the disturbance slowly developed while moving northwest. By the morning of September 29, the disturbance was upgraded to a 40 mph (65 km/h) tropical storm and based on ship reports and satellite imagery.

Its intensification was short-lived and Madeline remained at tropical storm strength for just 12 hours before it was downgraded into a tropical depression. Madeline remained at tropical depression strength until September 30. At that time, the EPHC {{reported that}} the circulation center was no longer visible and downgraded the system to a remnant low, while located 575 mi (925 km) to the southeast of Acapulco, Mexico.|$|E
5|$|No.6 Squadron's Lincolns were {{replaced}} with Canberra jet bombers in early 1955, and the unit became operational with these aircraft on 11 July. As {{part of the}} transition to the Canberra, the squadron's remaining aircrew were posted to the Lincoln Conversion Flight, which continued to support No.1 Squadron in Malaya, and replacement aircrew were posted from No.2 Squadron. The squadron suffered a number of accidents <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>two</b> years in which several Canberras were damaged as a result of defects with the aircraft. No.6 Squadron continued its training duties with the new aircraft; these included regular deployments to Darwin in the Northern Territory to participate in air defence exercises as well as training flights to Malaya and New Zealand. In early 1967 most of the squadron's personnel were transferred to No.2 Squadron to bring that unit up to its full strength before it deployed to South Vietnam as part of Australia's commitment to the Vietnam War. From this point onwards, No.6 Squadron was heavily engaged in training aircrew for service in South Vietnam.|$|E
