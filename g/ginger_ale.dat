5|$|Bond's {{drinking}} habits run {{throughout the}} series of books. During the course of On Her Majesty's Secret Service alone, Bond consumes forty-six drinks: Pouilly-Fuissé, Riquewihr and Marsala wines, most of a bottle of Algerian wine, some 1953 Château Mouton Rothschild claret, along with Taittinger and Krug champagnes and Babycham; for whiskies he consumes three bourbon and waters, half a pint of I.W. Harper bourbon, Jack Daniel's whiskey, two double bourbons on the rocks, two whisky and sodas, two neat scotches and one glass of neat whisky; vodka consumption totalled four vodka and tonics and three double vodka martinis; other spirits included two double brandies with <b>ginger</b> <b>ale,</b> a flask of Enzian Schnaps and a double gin: he also washed this down with four steins of German beer. Bond's alcohol intake {{does not seem to}} affect his performance.|$|E

Polar stopped selling whiskey and began selling carbonated beverages like waters, <b>ginger</b> <b>ales</b> and drys.|$|R

50|$|As {{is common}} with ginger beers in {{comparison}} to the lighter <b>ginger</b> <b>ales,</b> the <b>ginger</b> flavor present in Stoney is especially intense. There are several varieties of Stoney in different parts of Africa. Although they are all bottled by Coca-Cola, their recipes vary. The versions in Southern Africa tend to be more carbonated and sweeter while the East Africa version tends to have a much stronger ginger bite. Stoney Ginger Beer was introduced in South Africa in 1971.|$|R

25|$|Two of {{the largest}} soft-drink {{bottlers}} in the United States, each with more than $500 million in sales per year, are located in Birmingham. The Buffalo Rock Company, founded in 1901, was formerly a maker of just <b>ginger</b> <b>ale,</b> {{but now it is}} a major bottler for the Pepsi Cola Company. The Coca-Cola Bottling Company, United, founded in 1902, is the third-largest bottler of Coca-Cola products in the U.S.|$|E
25|$|Soft {{drinks are}} mixed with other {{ingredients}} in several contexts. In Western countries, in bars and other places where alcohol is served (e.g., airplanes, restaurants and nightclubs) many mixed drinks are made by blending a soft drink with hard liquor and serving the drink over ice. One well-known example is the rum and coke, which may also contain lime juice. Some homemade fruit punch recipes, {{which may or may}} not contain alcohol, contain a mixture of various fruit juices and soda pop (e.g., <b>ginger</b> <b>ale).</b> At ice cream parlours and 1950s-themed diners, ice cream floats are often sold.|$|E
25|$|Coca-Cola's {{advertising}} {{has significantly}} affected American culture, {{and it is}} frequently credited with inventing the modern image of Santa Claus as {{an old man in}} a red-and-white suit. Although the company did start using the red-and-white Santa image in the 1930s, with its winter advertising campaigns illustrated by Haddon Sundblom, the motif was already common. Coca-Cola was not even the first soft drink company to use the modern image of Santa Claus in its advertising: White Rock Beverages used Santa in advertisements for its <b>ginger</b> <b>ale</b> in 1923, after first using him to sell mineral water in 1915. Before Santa Claus, Coca-Cola relied on images of smartly dressed young women to sell its beverages. Coca-Cola's first such advertisement appeared in 1895, featuring the young Bostonian actress Hilda Clark as its spokeswoman.|$|E

5000|$|LA Metropolitan News-Enterprise Editor Roger Grace {{describes}} the original flavor as [...] "mellow yet perky with the mellowness {{attributed to the}} aging in oak barrels, and the perkiness {{to the use of}} more ginger and sugar than [...] "dry" [...] <b>ginger</b> <b>ales.</b> Many people believe that the taste of Vernors has changed significantly in recent years. Grace {{describes the}} current flavor as an [...] "emaciated version of a product that once was" [...] and [...] "sweetened carbonated water with ginger flavoring". Theories as to the reason for the claimed change in flavor include that the secret formula has been changed to use new products not originally available to Vernor, such as high fructose corn syrup; that it seems to have less carbonation than formerly; and that Vernors is no longer aged four years, but three in oak barrels.|$|R
25|$|In fact, {{the radio}} show was {{generally}} not announced as The Jack Benny Program. Instead, the primary name of the show tied to the sponsor. Benny's first sponsor was Canada Dry <b>Ginger</b> <b>Ale</b> from 1932 to 1933. Benny's sponsors included Chevrolet from 1933 to 1934, General Tire in 1934, and Jell-O from 1934 to 1942. The Jell-O Program Starring Jack Benny was so successful in selling Jell-O, in fact, that General Foods could not manufacture it quickly enough when sugar shortages arose {{in the early years}} of World War II, and the company stopped advertising the popular dessert mix. General Foods switched the Benny program from Jell-O to Grape-Nuts from 1942 to 1944, and it was, naturally, The Grape Nuts Program Starring Jack Benny. Benny's longest-running sponsor, was the American Tobacco Company's Lucky Strike cigarettes, from 1944 to 1955, when the show was usually announced as The Lucky Strike Program starring Jack Benny.|$|E

The production crew considered having Oyelowo wearing sunglasses to shield his eyes from any possible glass shards, but they later chose against it. There were scenes where some of the characters snorted cocaine. The [...] "cocaine" [...] was in actuality glucose powder that the actors did have to snort. Elsewhere, the crew used vegetable soup as vomit. The alcohol used in the series were made from non-alcoholic drinks; the production crew used fruit juices as wine, <b>ginger</b> <b>ale</b> as brandy, and cold tea as beer.|$|E

Graynor related to both characters, saying that [...] "I've had many nights as Caroline. And I've had many nights as Norah, taking care of Caroline."

She improvised an entire scene taking place at the Port Authority Bus Station in which Caroline talks to a stranger and which {{was not part of}} the script.

500|$|In {{an attempt}} to lend {{authenticity}} to the fictional Pawnee, Indiana setting, Parks and Recreation producers contacted the Bloomington, Indiana-based Upland Brewing Company {{and asked them to}} provide empty beer bottles and labels for the scene with the characters drinking in the town hall courtyard.

[...] They also drink Vernors <b>ginger</b> <b>ale,</b> a soft drink very popular in Indiana.

[...] From then on, she decided to [...] "just sort of build a wall around myself", {{to cope with the}} disappointment of not getting a part. In Los Angeles, Smith appeared in theatrical productions of Living on Salvation Street, for which she was paid $14 for each performance, Boys and Girls/Men and Women, and How the Other Half Loves, and played the recurring role of Louella Waters on the Showtime series Brothers.
