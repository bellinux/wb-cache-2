25|$|The {{main source}} of {{problems}} was confusion between hexadecimal number encoding and binary-coded decimal encodings of numbers. Both hexadecimal and BCD encode the numbers 0–9 as 0x0–0x9. But BCD encodes the number 10 as 0x10, whereas hexadecimal encodes the number 10 as 0x0A; 0x10 interpreted as a <b>hexadecimal</b> <b>encoding</b> represents the number 16.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{core dump}} files and error {{messages}} typically use <b>hexadecimal</b> <b>encoding,</b> as decimal and octal representations are less convenient to the programmer.|$|E
50|$|The Pentium F00F bug, {{shorthand}} for , the <b>hexadecimal</b> <b>encoding</b> of one offending instruction, more formally, the invalid operand with locked CMPXCHG8B instruction bug, is a design {{flaw in the}} majority of Intel Pentium, Pentium MMX, and Pentium OverDrive processors (all in the P5 microarchitecture).|$|E

50|$|The names Able to Fox {{were also}} {{widely used in}} the early days of <b>hexadecimal</b> digital <b>encoding</b> of text in {{speaking}} of the hexadecimal digits equivalent to decimal 10 to 15, although the written form was simply the capital letters A to F. See hexadecimal.|$|R

50|$|The {{main source}} of {{problems}} was confusion between hexadecimal number encoding and BCD encodings of numbers. The numbers 0 through 9 are encoded in both hexadecimal and BCD as 00 through 09. But the decimal number 10 is encoded in hexadecimal as 0A and in BCD as 10. Thus a BCD 10 interpreted as a <b>hexadecimal</b> <b>encoding</b> erroneously represents the decimal number 16.|$|E
5000|$|Binary values (bit sequences) are encoded as {{hexadecimal}} {{and surrounded}} by double quotes, with a leading character indicating the number of unused bits (0, 1, 2, or 3) followed by uppercase <b>hexadecimal</b> <b>encoding</b> of data. It {{is important to note}} that the entire binary value is encoded as a single hexadecimal number, with the highest order bits in the first hex character and the lowest order bits in the last one.|$|E
50|$|Intel HEX {{consists}} of lines of ASCII text that {{are separated by}} line feed or carriage return characters or both. Each text line contains <b>hexadecimal</b> characters that <b>encode</b> multiple binary numbers. The binary numbers may represent data, memory addresses, or other values, depending on {{their position in the}} line and the type and length of the line. Each text line is called a record.|$|R
5000|$|The barcode <b>encodes</b> <b>hexadecimal</b> digits (i.e., the hex digits 0-F) as 4 bars (bits). The LSB is on {{the first}} bar on the left, and the MSB is the last bar on the right. A [...] "0" [...] bit is {{represented}} as a narrow bar, followed by a wide space. The [...] "1" [...] is represented by a wide bar, followed by a narrow space.|$|R
5000|$|Each line names an {{application}} program, {{and gives a}} hexadecimal numeric constant to associate with that program. The <b>hexadecimal</b> numeric constant <b>encodes</b> the compatibility bitflags for that particular application, that Windows applies when the application is executed. Make Compatible merely provides a graphical user interface for editing these flags in an easy way, rather than editing [...] manually, with a text editor. It allows one to set and unset individual flags {{without having to know}} their numeric values.|$|R
5000|$|BinHex, {{originally}} {{short for}} [...] "binary-to-hexadecimal", is a binary-to-text encoding {{system that was}} used on the classic Mac OS for sending binary files through e-mail. Originally a <b>hexadecimal</b> <b>encoding,</b> subsequent versions of BinHex are more similar to uuencode, but combined both [...] "forks" [...] of the Mac file system together along with extended file information. BinHexed files take up more space than the original files, but will not be corrupted by non-"8-bit clean" [...] software.|$|E
5000|$|The Arduino IDE {{supports}} the languages C and C++ using special rules of code structuring. The Arduino IDE supplies a software library from the Wiring project, which provides many common {{input and output}} procedures. User-written code only requires two basic functions, for starting the sketch and the main program loop, that are compiled and linked with a program stub main (...) into an executable cyclic executive program with the GNU toolchain, also included with the IDE distribution. The Arduino IDE employs the program avrdude to convert the executable code into a text file in <b>hexadecimal</b> <b>encoding</b> that is loaded into the Arduino board by a loader program in the board's firmware.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an effective approach for detecting and preventing known {{as well as}} novel SQL injection attacks. Unlike existing approaches, ours (1) is resistant to evasion techniques, such as <b>hexadecimal</b> <b>encoding</b> or inline comment, (2) does not require analysis or modification of the application source code, (3) does not need training traces, (4) does not require modification of the runtime environment, such as PHP interpreter or JVM, and (5) is independent of the back-end database used. Our approach is based on two simple observations, that (1) in malicious HTTP requests, parameter values are used not only as literals in the corresponding SQL statements but also as other SQL constructs, such as delimiters, identifiers or operators; and (2) a malformed parameter value in an HTTP request comprises more than one SQL token. We use J 2 EE to implement a tool we have named SQLPrevent that dynamically detects SQL injection attacks using the above heuristics, and blocks the corresponding SQL statements from being submitted to the back-end database. Using the AMNESIA testbed, we evaluate SQLPrevent over 15, 000 unique HTT...|$|E
