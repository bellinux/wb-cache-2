40|$|Active carbon {{hollow fibers}} were {{prepared}} from regenerated polysulfone hollow fibers by chemical activation using: {{disodium hydrogen phosphate}} 2 -hydrate, <b>disodium</b> <b>tetraborate</b> 10 -hydrate, hydrogen peroxide, and diammonium hydrogen phosphate. After chemical activation fibers were carbonized in an inert atmosphere. The specific surface area and porosity of obtained carbons were studied by nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms at 77 K, while the structures were examined with scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The activation process increases these adsorption properties of fibers being more pronounced for active carbon fibers obtained with <b>disodium</b> <b>tetraborate</b> 10 -hydrate and hydrogen peroxide as activator. The obtained active hollow carbons are microporous with different pore size distribution. Chemical activation with phosphates produces active carbon material with small surface area but with both mesopores and micropores. X-ray diffraction shows that besides turbostratic structure typical for carbon materials, there are some peaks which indicate some intermediate reaction products when sodium salts were used as activating agent. Based on data from the electrochemical measurements the activity and porosity of the active fibers depend strongly on the oxidizing agent applied...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Boron and boron {{compounds}} {{have been}} long used for pressure treatment, dip-diffusion, and remedial treatments of wood {{because of their}} proven efficacy against fungi and insects. These materials are especially attractive because their high water solubility promotes deeper penetration into wood. Other useful properties of boron include its neutral pH, non-corrosiveness, lack of color or odor, and little or no effect on wood strength. Boron also has low-mammalian toxicity and minimal environmental effects. However, high water solubility limits outdoor applications because the boron will leach from the wood when it is exposed to rain or is in direct soil contact. Boron is widely used as a component in external remedial pastes, primarily as disodium octaborate tetrahydrate (DOT). This boron compound has higher water solubility and only remains in wood 3 to 7 years after application. Using differing degrees of water solubilities in the paste system might result in longer-term protection.

40|$|The {{concentration}} of boron, an essential micronutrient for plants, presents {{a narrow range}} between deficiency and toxicity. In order to provide the boron requirement for plants, and to avoid toxicity problems, boron compounds are mixed with basic fertilizers. Sodium borate pentahydrate {{was used as a}} boron source. Ammonium orthophosphates fertilizers with boron were prepared by neutralizing phosphoric acid with ammonia and addition of variable amounts of sodium <b>tetraborate</b> <b>pentahydrate</b> to the reaction mixture at a NH 3 :H 3 PO 4 molar ratio of 1. 5. The fertilizers obtained with boron contents ranging from 0. 05 to 1 % (w/w) were fully characterized by chemical analysis, thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction and infrared spectrophotometry. The studies showed that up to 500 °C, regardless of the boron content, no significant changes concerning thermal stability and nutritional properties occurred. Above 500 °C, an increase of thermal stability with an increase of the boron content was observed. X-Ray diffraction of a heat-treated sample containing 5 % (w/w) boron indicated the appearance of boron orthophosphate, BPO 4, as a new crystalline phase, and the disappearance of the previous structures above 500 °C, which explains the increase in thermal stability...|$|R

W. auropunctata has since spread throughout Hawaii island, and is reported in homes, landscapes, plant nurseries and orchards, and forested areas. This study evaluated: 1) {{the attractiveness of}} several granular, liquid, gel, and paste insecticidal ant baits for homeowner and commercial use {{as compared with the}} standard granular baits containing hydramethylnon known to be attractive to and effective against W. auropunctata, and 2) the effects of weathering on granular bait attractiveness. Field attractiveness choice tests were conducted in an infested 37. 2 -m 2 plot, and worker ant foraging and recruitment were recorded at 15 -min intervals for 2 h. Granular and paste products that were as attractive as standard granular baits (Amdro Fire Ant Bait, Probait) included others formulated with hydramethylnon, abamectin, hydramethylnon and S-methoprene, indoxacarb, fipronil, and metaflumizone.

50|$|Boron (B) is the {{chemical}} element with atomic number 5, occurring as 10B and 11B. At standard temperature and pressure, boron is a trivalent metalloid that has several different allotropes. Amorphous boron is a brown powder {{formed as a}} product of many chemical reactions. Crystalline boron is a very hard, black material with a high melting point and exists in many polymorphs: Two rhombohedral forms, α-boron and β-boron containing 12 and 106.7 atoms in the rhombohedral unit cell respectively, and 50-atom tetragonal boron are the most common. Boron has a density of 2.34−3. Boron's most common isotope is 11B at 80.22%, which contains 5 protons and 6 neutrons. The other common isotope is 10 at 19.78%, which contains 5 protons and 5 neutrons. These are the only stable isotopes of boron; however other isotopes have been synthesised. Boron forms covalent bonds with other nonmetals and has oxidation states of 1, 2, 3 and 4.Boron does not occur naturally as a free element, but in compounds such as borates. The most common sources of boron are tourmaline, borax, Na2B4O5(OH)4·8H2O, and kernite, Na2B4O5(OH)4·2H2O. it is difficult to obtain pure boron. It can be made through the magnesium reduction of boron trioxide, B2O3. This oxide is made by melting boric acid, B(OH)3, which in turn is obtained from borax. Small amounts of pure boron can be made by the thermal decomposition of boron bromide, BBr3, in hydrogen gas over hot tantalum wire, which acts as a catalyst. The most commercially important sources of boron are: sodium <b>tetraborate</b> <b>pentahydrate,</b> Na2B4O7 · 5H2O, which is used in large amounts in making insulating fiberglass and sodium perborate bleach; boron carbide, a ceramic material, is used to make armour materials, especially in bulletproof vests for soldiers and police officers; orthoboric acid, H3BO3 or boric acid, used in the production of textile fiberglass and flat panel displays; sodium tetraborate decahydrate, Na2B4O7 · 10H2O or borax, used in the production of adhesives; and the isotope boron-10 is used as a control for nuclear reactors, as a shield for nuclear radiation, and in instruments used for detecting neutrons.|$|R
40|$|Capillary {{electrophoresis}} (CE) {{has been}} used for decades for the determination of different classes of pharmaceuticals in different sample matrices because of its advantageous high separation efficiency and fast analysis time. However, the major disadvantage of CE is its poor detection sensitivity. In the current work, the improvement in detection sensitivity of CE has been extensively studied and applied for the determination of two classes of pharmaceutical compounds. Electrokinetic supercharging (EKS), a powerful preconcentration technique in CE, has been studied for the analysis of seven non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The separation selectivity was optimised via adjustment of the concentration of the separation buffer (<b>disodium</b> <b>tetraborate</b> pH 9. 20) and the amount of methanol as an organic modifier. Different EKS parameters, including injection voltage, injection time, and amounts of leading and terminating electrolytes were studied. The optimised conditions allowed detection sensitivity to be improved by 2, 400 -fold when compared to field-amplified sample stacking (FASS) and the limits of detection (LODs) were down to 50 ng/L. A valuable modification to the EKS system, namely counter-flow EKS (CF-EKS), has been developed in order to decrease the amount of the interfering sample matrix involved in the system, hence, larger amount of analytes could be concentrated. Computer simulation studies were undertaken {{in order to understand the}} trends in sensitivity enhancement from EKS to CF-EKS. After assigning the optimal counter pressure and injection voltage in CF-EKS, an artificial neural network (ANN) was developed for optimising the injection time and the amount of terminating electrolyte. Upon comparison with FASS, the optimal conditions of CF-EKS allowed the sensitivity to be enhanced by 11, 800 -fold and the LODs were decreased to 10. 70 ng/L for the studied NSAIDs. The on-line hyphenation of EKS-CE with the highly precise electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was for the first time investigated, and then applied for the determination of five acidic hypolipidaemic drugs. The separation was performed in a co-electroosmotic flow (co-EOF) mode using the EOF reversal agent hexadimethrine bromide (HDMB) in ammonium bicarbonate buffer pH 9. 00. An ANN was developed for the optimisation of the separation selectivity, and the EKS-ESI-MS system provided enhancement in detection sensitivity of 1, 000 -fold when compared to FASS. The LODs for the studied hypolipidaemic drugs were decreased to 180 ng/L. Simultaneous separation of charged and neutral hypolipidaemic drugs was made possible by the application of micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC). Ammonium bicarbonate pH 8. 50 was used as a separation electrolyte and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was used as a micelle-forming agent. In order to enhance the detection sensitivity in MEKC, three on-line preconcentration strategies, namely sweeping, analyte focusing by micelle collapse (AFMC) and simultaneous FASS-sweeping were investigated and applied for the determination of eight hypolipidaemic drugs.
