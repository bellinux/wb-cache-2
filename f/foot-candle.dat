For sustained CO 2 fixation, light intensities below 500 <b>foot-candles</b> were required.

40|$|In {{an earlier}} report (Buchbinder, Solowey and Phelps, 1941) {{it was shown}} that both {{daylight}} and sunlight after passing through a window are lethal for streptococci maintained in a simulated room environment. Tests {{of the effect of}} diffuse daylight on one short chain strain of alpha hemolytic streptococcus yielded re-producible data which indicated a geometric death rate. Similar findings were obtained with a short chain strain of Group B beta hemolytic streptococcus. Tests on a long chain strain of Group A beta hemolytic streptococcus, however, yielded non-geometric death rates during the usual one and two'hour test periods. It was calculated from the data that daylight would destroy 50 per cent of the very short chains of the alpha hemolytic strain in 45 min-utes, whereas 200 minutes would be required for the same effect on the Group A strain. This divergence in death rates, as well as the non-geometric course of death for the'Group A strain, were explained by the difference in average chain length of the two strains. It was also found that the lethal power of diffuse daylight varied with its spectral distribution and intensity. Light from clear blue skies seemed to be most effective per <b>foot-candle,</b> where-as that from very cloudy skies was least effective.

40|$|The {{principle}} glycoalkaloids in {{potatoes are}} a-solanine and a-chaconine. They contribute flavor to potatoes but at higher concentrations cause bitterness and are toxic to humans. Their natural function is probably {{to serve as}} stress metabolites or phytoalexins {{for the protection of}} the potato when attacked by insects, fungi, etc. Increases of solanine in the potato peel are closely associated with green-ing (synthesis of chlorophyll) of the peel. These biochemical processes are independent of each other, but are both activated by light. For food safety purposes, an upper limit for glycoalkaloid content of 20 mg per 100 g of potato is generally accepted (100 g is slightly less than 1 / 4 lb.). Concentrations of glycoalkaloids are 3 to 10 times greater in the peel than in the flesh. There is consid-erable variation in glycoalkaloid content among potato cultivars. The average content in the peel can vary from 3 to more than 100 mg/ 100 g of peel. For peeled potatoes, the average content can vary from 0. 10 to 4. 50 mg/ 100 g. Storage conditions, especially light and temperature, are mainly responsible for increases in solanine during marketing. Although the glycoalkaloid content can increase in the dark, the rate of formation is only about 20 % the rate of formation in light. The rate of synthesis of glycoalkaloids at 24 °C(75 °F) is about twice the rate at 7 °C(45 °F). Assuming a content of 20 mg/ 100 g of fresh peel, and assuming that the potatoes are 1 foot below a single tube 30 watt fluorescent light (about 200 <b>foot-candle</b> or 18. 5 lux light intensity) which would be a reasonable estimate of exposure in a well lighted retail display area, the solanine content would increase dramatically after 24 hours: the solanine content would double if the potatoes were at 7 °C(45 °F), be 4 times greater at 16 °C(60 °F), and be 9 times greater in potatoes a...|$|E
