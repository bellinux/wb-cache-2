2500|$|Although it {{considered}} {{creation of a}} separate aviation department to act as the centralized authority for decision-making, both the War and the Navy Departments opposed it, and on October 1, 1917, Congress instead legalized {{the existence of the}} APB and changed its name to the [...] "Aircraft Board", transferring its functions from the Council of National Defense to the secretaries of War and the Navy. Even so, the Aircraft Board in practice had little control over procurement contracts and functioned mostly as an <b>information</b> <b>provider</b> between industrial, governmental, and military entities. Nor did the [...] "Equipment Division" [...] of the Signal Corps exercise such control. Established by the Office of the Chief Signal Officer (OCSO) as one of the operating components of the Aviation Section, its task was to unify and coordinate the various agencies involved but its head was a commissioned former member of the APB who did nothing to create any effective coordination. Moreover, the largely wood and fabric airframe designs of World War I did not lend themselves to being made with the mass production methods of the automotive industry, which used considerable amounts of metallic materials instead, and the priority of mass producing spare parts was neglected. Though individual areas within the aviation industry responded well, the industry as a whole failed. Efforts to mass produce European aircraft under license largely failed because the aircraft, made by hand, were not amenable to the more precise American manufacturing methods. At the same time the Aeronautical Division of the OCSO was renamed the Air Division with continued responsibility for training and operations but with no influence on acquisition or doctrine. In the end the decision-making process in aircraft procurement was badly fragmented and production on a large scale proved impossible.|$|E

II) An element in the query selection predicate is a member of more than one high level concepts.

40|$|This study {{examines}} information channels used by seniors and measures their perceived effectiveness. A parallel study of <b>information</b> <b>providers</b> 2 ̆ 7 use of channels is included {{so that we}} may see which information channels are over utilized or under utilized according to effectiveness. Information about seniors 2 ̆ 7 perception of which channels are most effective for getting information may lead to the development of procedures or provisions likely to lead to more effective use of such channels. The study revealed major differences in the use of information channels by the seniors compared to the use by the <b>information</b> <b>providers.</b> Mass media were particularly under-utilized by <b>information</b> <b>providers,</b> while workshops and seminars were perceived to be much more important to <b>information</b> <b>providers</b> than they were to seniors. Seniors named a much wider range of channels than <b>information</b> <b>providers.</b> Shut-ins reported greater use of television, interpersonal channels, and medical channels than other seniors. Other findings suggest that use of all types of channels declines with age and that some groups may not be reached at all by conventional channels of information. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

Provision of information is central for the empowerment of patients to participate in their care. There is not enough evidence regarding the nursing role in the information delivery process in cancer patients. Descriptive literature review. From January 1990 – 2008, databases searched included Medline, CINAHL, PubMed, CancerLit and the Cochrane Library. Original research articles addressing the role of nurses in information delivery were included. We explored {{evidence on}}: (1) the effectiveness of nurses as <b>information</b> <b>providers,</b> (2) the way patients evaluate nurses’ input to information delivery, (3) the extent to which nurses contribute to information delivery to cancer patients and (4) the types of information provided by nurses. The most important findings were: (1) nurses’ role as <b>information</b> <b>providers</b> for cancer patients is prominent, especially after the initiation of treatment, (2) specialist nurses are very effective in providing information, (3) no clear evidence exists on how nurses compare with other health-care professionals as <b>information</b> <b>providers</b> and (4) some evidence exists that patients may prefer nurses as <b>information</b> <b>providers</b> at specific times in their treatment and especially in regards to symptom management. Well-designed studies provide some evidence that nurses are effective as <b>information</b> <b>providers</b> to cancer patients. Specifically, oncology nurses are able to provide information of both high quality and of appropriate quantity and to assist individuals to interpret information provided by others. Oncology nurses should be specifically educated and prepared to offer explicit, practical and timely information and they should be trained in interpersonal communication skills, which will increase their ability to comprehend patient information needs...|$|R
