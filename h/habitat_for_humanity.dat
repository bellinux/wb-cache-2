5|$|By February17, 80percent of {{the grid}} was restored; however, only 10percent homes were {{actually}} connected.

5|$|Following the storm, damaged {{buildings}} polluted {{rivers in}} South Korea with chemicals and heavy metals. The country utilized 30,000soldiers {{to assist in}} cleaning up and repairing storm damage. President Kim Dae-jung authorized emergency funding for disaster aid. Much of Gangneung lost power and water; as a result, relief supplies {{were sent to the}} affected citizens. By ten days after Rusa struck the country, power lines were restored and transportation returned to normal. After an appeal to other residents in the country, the South Korea Red Cross chapter received $49million in donations (₩58billion won), mostly from the country's northwest portion. The agency provided 50,680meals to 16,919families, as well as clothing and cooking supplies. Residents in the country raised about $60million (₩72.1billion won) in disaster relief, the highest such total for a disaster in the nation. The Chinese Red Cross sent $20,000 to the South Korean Red Cross in the weeks after the storm. On September13, the South Korean government declared 203cities and counties as disaster zones, which entitled 8,714families who sustained storm damage to receive government loans. The combined storm damage and floods preceding the storm caused the nation's economy to contract during the third quarter of 2002. The 2003 fiscal year reported a $300million deficit for non-life insurance companies, mostly due to losses from the typhoon. Crop damage from Rusa caused the price of rice to increase to their highest levels since 1980. In the year after the storm, the South Korean government worked to reconstruct damaged roads and provided monthly assistance payments to families who lost their homes. However, many residents remained homeless and were residing in temporary shelters. The country's <b>Habitat</b> <b>for</b> <b>Humanity</b> built 69houses for storm victims in 2003, although that was only for {{a small portion of the}} overall number of people affected. About a year after Rusa hit, Typhoon Maemi also struck South Korea with stronger winds, causing $3.74billion in damage and 117deaths. The damage total was less than from Rusa but was more significant to industrial areas.|$|E
