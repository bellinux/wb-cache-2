5000|$|One {{criterion}} for separating paranoid schizophrenia from other types is delusion. A delusion {{is a belief}} that is held strong even when the evidence shows otherwise. Some common delusions associated with paranoid schizophrenia include, “believing {{that the government is}} monitoring every move you make, or that a co-worker is poisoning your lunch." [...] In all but rare cases, these beliefs are irrational, and can cause the person holding them to behave abnormally. Another frequent type of delusion is a <b>delusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>grandeur,</b> or the “fixed, false belief that one possesses superior qualities such as genius, fame, omnipotence, or wealth." [...] Common ones include, “the belief that you can fly, that you're famous, or that you have a relationship with a famous person." ...|$|E

This leads to distinguish between primary, secondary, [...] ., n-ary types of delusional arguments. Examples of delusional arguments leading to delusion of reference, delusion of influence, thought-broadcasting delusion and <b>delusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>grandeur</b> are described and then analysed. This suggests finally a way susceptible of improving the efficiency of cognitive therapy for delusions. The {{purpose of this article}} is to present, as far as I know, a novel account of several types of delusions observed in psychoses. This account results from a logical analysis of delusions, where delusions classically found in psychoses {{are regarded as}} conclusions resulting from fallacious arguments. Although their conclusion appears obviously false, delusional arguments are described here as arguments for which the determination of the defective step can sometimes prove nontrivial. The description of delusions as fallacious arguments 1 leads finally to several suggestions, which could allow to reinforce the effectiveness of cognitive therapy 2. I am very grateful to David Kingdon, Albert Ellis, Eugen Fischer and Robert Chapman for very helpful comments on earlier drafts...|$|E

2500|$|Grandiose <b>delusions</b> or <b>delusions</b> <b>of</b> <b>grandeur</b> are principally a subtype of {{delusional}} disorder but could possibly feature as {{a symptom of}} schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar disorder. Grandiose delusions are characterized by fantastical beliefs that one is famous, omnipotent or otherwise very powerful. The delusions are generally fantastic, often with a supernatural, science-fictional, or religious bent. In colloquial usage, one who overestimates one's own abilities, talents, stature or situation is sometimes said to have [...] "delusions of grandeur". This is generally due to excessive pride, rather than any actual delusions. Grandiose <b>delusions</b> or <b>delusions</b> <b>of</b> <b>grandeur</b> can also be associated with megalomania.|$|R
