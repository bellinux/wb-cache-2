5|$|Meanders are sinuous bends in rivers {{or other}} channels, which form as a fluid, most often water, flows around bends. As {{soon as the}} path is {{slightly}} curved, the size and curvature of each loop increases as helical flow drags material like sand and gravel across the river {{to the inside of}} the bend. The outside of the loop is left clean and unprotected, so erosion accelerates, further increasing the meandering <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> positive feedback loop.|$|E

5|$|On 4 May 1684 an {{earthquake}} devastated the city, severely damaging the Santa María castle. A road linking the Santa María de la Cabeza and San Antonio de la Eminencia castles was mentioned by Agustín Crame in a 1777 {{proposal for the}} defense of the city. Crame opposed the idea, but stated that if a road were built it should be a gravel one.

25|$|In the 16th century, the Scottish Reformation {{resulted}} in Scotland's conversion to Presbyterianism through the Church of Scotland. The revolution resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> {{hatred of the}} Roman Church. High Anglicanism also came under intense persecution after Charles I attempted to reform the Church of Scotland. The attempted reforms caused chaos, however, because they were seen as being overly Catholic in form in being based heavily on sacraments and ritual.|$|E
25|$|By the mid-1440s, the Woodvilles were <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> position. Jacquetta {{was related}} to both King Henry and Queen Margaret by marriage.

As a personal favourite, she also enjoyed special privileges and influence at court. Margaret influenced Henry to create her husband Baron Rivers in 1448, and he was a prominent partisan of the House of Lancaster as the Wars of the Roses began.|$|E
25|$|The witch-hunt of the 16th and 17th centuries was an {{organized}} effort by authorities {{in many countries}} to destroy a supposed conspiracy of witches thought to pose a deadly threat to Christendom. According to these authorities, witches were numerous, and in conscious alliance with Satan, forming a sort of Satanic counter-religion. Witch-hunts in this sense must {{be separated from the}} belief in witches, the evil eye, and other such phenomena, which are common features of folk belief worldwide. The belief that witches are not just individual villains but conspirators organized <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> but well-hidden cult is a distinguishing feature of the early modern witch-hunt.|$|E

25|$|The {{widespread}} {{belief in}} magic and religion {{may have resulted}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> placebo effect; that is, the perceived validity of the cure {{may have contributed to}} its effectiveness. The impact of the emphasis on magic is seen in the selection of remedies or ingredients for them. Ingredients were sometimes selected seemingly because they were derived from a substance, plant or animal that had characteristics which in some way corresponded to the symptoms of the patient. This is known as the principle of simila similibus ("similar with similar") and is found throughout the history of medicine up to the modern practice of homeopathy. Thus an ostrich egg is included in the treatment of a broken skull, and an amulet portraying a hedgehog might be used against baldness.|$|E
25|$|John II died in 1143, {{leaving the}} Byzantine Empire a strong army, {{significant}} reserves of cash, and improved prestige. However, the new emperor, Manuel Comnenus, directed {{much of his}} attention to Hungary, Italy, Serbia and the Crusader states rather than Anatolia. While Manuel was largely successful in defeating attacks on the empire and holding the Balkans, his policy in Italy was a failure and the lavish expenditure of his rule has been criticised, most notably by the Byzantine historian Choniates. During this period, the Seljuq Turks were able to subdue their enemies, the Danishmends under Kilij Arslan II. This resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> centralised Turkish state based at Konya, leaving the Byzantines arguably in a worse position {{than they had been}} under John II.|$|E
25|$|The {{supporters}} of the cult at Uppsala drew a mutual agreement of toleration with Olof Skötkonung, the first Christian king of Sweden, who ascended to the throne in the 990s. Presumably Olof Skötkonung was not <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> enough position to violently enforce the observance of Christianity in Uppland. Instead he established an episcopal see at Skara in Västergötland, near his own stronghold at Husaby around 1000. Another episcopal see was established at Sigtuna in the 1060s by King Stenkil, according to Adam of Bremen. This seat was moved to Gamla Uppsala probably some time between 1134 and 1140. This might have been because of Uppsala's importance as an old royal residence and thing site, {{but it may also}} have been inspired by a desire to show that the resistance to Christianity in Uppland had been defeated. By papal initiative an archdiocese for Sweden was established at Uppsala in 1164.|$|E

25|$|The river rose in mid-April, and by April 19, 1870, judging {{that the}} river was high {{enough to make the}} run, Captain Miller ordered lines cast off. His plan was to drift down with the current, then run the engines in reverse to gain {{steering}} control in the rapids. Going over Copper Ledge Falls, just a few hundred yards downstream, the boat first spun around three times <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> eddy just above the drop. Then the bow went over and the whole boat tilted sharply downwards until the sternwheel was spinning around free in the air. Once the boat hit the bottom of the drop, the sternwheel started to break up, throwing the boat out of control and into some rocks which crushed part of her bow. The boat was twisting and wracking and then a boiler valve broke, filling the engine room with steam. Captain Miller put ashore after this, and the crew repaired the vessel. Fortunately the smashed portion of the bow turned out to be above the waterline, and by 9:00a.m. the next day they were ready to proceed.|$|E
25|$|As {{the largest}} {{newspaper}} in Rhode Island, and the state's leading {{voice for the}} new Republican Party (then only six years old), the editorship of the Journal put Angell <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> public position for the first time. His first foray into electoral politics came early on, as 1860 was an election year. He lent the paper's backing to the gubernatorial candidacy of abolitionist Republican nominee Seth Padelford, which failed when a coalition of various interests instead led to the election of fellow Republican William Sprague. In the presidential contest, Angell felt that Rhode Island's interests would be best served by the nomination of staunch abolitionist William H. Seward as the Republican candidate. But when the somewhat more moderate (and virtual unknown in Rhode Island) Abraham Lincoln was unexpectedly nominated, he put {{the power of the}} Journal behind Lincoln's candidacy, requesting favorable letters from his old pupil John Hay, who was working in Lincoln's law offices at the time, in order to generate enthusiasm for Lincoln. In the end, Lincoln won Rhode Island by a margin of 61.4% to 38.6%.|$|E
25|$|On {{the lower}} Danube, which was given {{priority}} over the upper Danube, this required the annexation of Moesia. The Romans' target were thus the tribes which inhabited Moesia, namely (from West to East) the Triballi, Moesi and those Getae who dwelt South of the Danube. The Bastarnae {{were also a}} target because they had recently subjugated the Triballi, whose territory lay on the southern bank of the Danube between the tributary rivers Utus (Vit) and Ciabrus (Tsibritsa), with their chief town at Oescus (Gigen, Bulgaria). In addition, Augustus wanted to avenge the defeat of C. Antonius at Histria (Sinoe) 32 years before and to recover the lost military standards. These were held <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> fortress called Genucla (Isaccea, near modern Tulcea, Romania, in the Danube delta region), controlled by Zyraxes, the local Getan king. The man selected for the task was Marcus Licinius Crassus, grandson of Crassus the triumvir and an experienced general at 33 years of age, who was appointed proconsul of Macedonia in 29 BC.|$|E

25|$|Geller {{began to}} make his mark in the late 1940s, as he won the USSR Championship {{semifinal}} qualifier at Tbilisi 1949 with 11½/16, thus advancing to the final later that year. His finals debut was sensational at URS-ch17 at Moscow; as a virtual unknown he tied for 3rd–4th places with 12½/19, behind only winners David Bronstein and Vasily Smyslov. Geller defeated such established players as Semyon Furman, Isaac Boleslavsky, Alexander Kotov, Salo Flohr, fellow finals debutant Tigran Petrosian, Viacheslav Ragozin, and Grigory Levenfish. Despite this showing, he was obliged {{to return to the}} semifinal level the next year, but advanced with a third-place finish in the 1950 qualifier at Kiev with 9/15. At URS-ch18 at Moscow 1950, Geller made 9/17 for a shared 7th–10th place; the winner was Paul Keres. Also in 1950, Geller won the Ukrainian Championship at Kiev, the first of his four titles in that event; he repeated from 1957 to 1959, with all three events at Kiev. Geller in 1950 made his international debut at the Przepiorka Memorial at Iwonicz Zdroj with 11½/19 for seventh place <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> field; Keres won again.|$|E
25|$|A crowd mills {{about before}} the Cathedral of the Intercession (the Temple of Vasiliy the Blessed) in Red Square. Many are beggars, and policemen {{occasionally}} appear. A {{group of men}} enters, discussing the anathema the deacon had declared on Grishka (Grigoriy) Otrepyev in the mass. They identify Grishka as the Tsarevich. With growing excitement they sing of the advance of his forces to Kromï, of his intent to retake his father's throne, and of the defeat he will deal to the Godunovs. A yuródivïy enters, pursued by urchins. He sings a nonsensical song ("The moon is flying, the kitten is crying"). The urchins greet him and rap on his metal hat. The yuródivïy has a kopek, which the urchins promptly steal. He whines pathetically. Boris and his retinue exit the Cathedral. The boyars distribute alms. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> chorus ("Benefactor father... Give us bread!"), the hungry people beg for bread. As the chorus subsides, the yuródivïy's cries are heard. Boris asks why he cries. The yuródivïy reports the theft of his kopek and asks Boris to order the boys' slaughter, {{just as he did}} {{in the case of the}} Tsarevich. Shuysky wants the yuródivïy seized, but Boris instead asks for the holy man's prayers. As Boris exits, the yuródivïy declares that the Mother of God will not allow him to pray for Tsar Herod (see Massacre of the Innocents). The yuródivïy then sings his lament ("Flow, flow, bitter tears!") about the fate of Russia.|$|E

Isaac claims that the empire did not have the intelligence capacity or centralised military planning to sustain a grand strategy e.g. there was no equivalent to a modern army's general staff. In any case, claims Isaac, the empire was not interested in [...] "defence" [...] at all: it was fundamentally aggressive both in ideology and military posture, up to and including the 4th century.|$|E
