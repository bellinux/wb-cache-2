For {{the next two years}} the movement grew tremendously as Sahrawi refugees continued flocking to the camps and Algeria and Libya supplied arms and funding. Within months, its army had expanded to several thousand armed fighters, camels were replaced by modern jeeps (most of them were Spanish Land Rover Santana jeeps, captured from Moroccan soldiers), and 19th-century muskets were replaced by assault rifles. The reorganized army was able to inflict severe damage through guerrilla-style hit-and-run attacks against opposing forces in Western Sahara and in Morocco and Mauritania proper.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Relict {{populations of}} Crocodylus niloticus persist in Chad, Egypt and Mauritania. Although {{crocodiles}} were widespread throughout the Sahara {{until the early}} 20 (th) century, increased aridity combined with human persecution led to local extinction. Knowledge on distribution, occupied habitats, population size and prey availability is scarce in most populations. This study evaluates the status of Saharan crocodiles and provides new data for Mauritania to assist conservation planning. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A series of surveys in Mauritania detected crocodile presence in 78 localities dispersed across 10 river basins and most tended to be isolated within river basins. Permanent <b>gueltas</b> and seasonal tâmoûrts were the most common occupied habitats. Crocodile encounters ranged from one to more than 20 individuals, but in most localities less than five crocodiles were observed. Larger numbers were observed after the rainy season and during night sampling. Crocodiles were found dead in between water points along dry river-beds suggesting the occurrence of dispersal. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Research priorities in Chad and Egypt should focus on quantifying population size and pressures exerted on habitats. The present study increased in by 35 % the number of known crocodile localities in Mauritania. <b>Gueltas</b> are crucial for the persistence of mountain populations. Oscillations in water availability throughout the year and the small dimensions of <b>gueltas</b> affect biological traits, including activity and body size. Studies are needed to understand adaptation traits of desert populations. Molecular analyses are needed to quantify genetic variability, population sub-structuring and effective population size, and detect the occurrence of gene flow. Monitoring is needed to detect demographical and genetical trends in completely isolated populations. Crocodiles are apparently vulnerable during dispersal events. Awareness campaigns focusing on the vulnerability and relict value of crocodiles should be implemented. Classification of Mauritanian mountains as protected areas should be prioritised...|$|R

30|$|The {{environment}} of the Tadrart Acacus is briefly outlined in the volume, including discussion of its climate, landscape, geomorphology and vegetation. It is a mountain range rising to peaks varying between 800 and 1, 300  m above sea level, and running some 150 km {{from north to south}} and 50 km east to west. Today, the climate is hyperarid, with mean annual precipitation of 0 – 20  mm (although rain is erratic and does not occur every year). Despite this low and erratic precipitation, vegetation is still present year-round in certain places, such as along the wadi floors—the wadis being one of the main ecosystems in the desert. Management of water resources is clearly of central significance for the pastoralists. Water is mainly sourced from wells (both artificial and natural) and ponds where rainfall accumulates (known as <b>gueltas).</b>|$|R

5000|$|Because of its {{altitude}} (on average between 500 and 900 m) {{and despite}} its low rainfall (50 to 160 mm/year {{on the lower}} plateau), the Aïr forms a green region {{in comparison with the}} surrounding deserts, especially after the August-September seasonal rains. The climate is classified as Sahel, like that of the regions well to its south. While the mountains are largely bare of vegetation, the dry wadi river valleys (known by the Hausa term [...] "Kori") channel and hold rainwater in <b>gueltas</b> (stone pools, such as that near the town of Timia), creating oases which provide forage for animals, and in some areas, farming. The high Bagzane plateau of the central Aïr in particular provides adequate rainfall for intensive agriculture. Other, vast, areas of the region are entirely devoid of plant life and with their volcanic protrusions and rock fields present an otherworldly appearance.|$|R

2500|$|The flora in the Tibesti is Saharomontane, mixing Mediterranean, Sahara, Sahel and Afromontane vegetation. Biodiversity and {{endemism}} {{levels are}} much higher in the Tibesti than in the Aïr Mountains or the Ennedi Plateau, although the vegetation's coverage is highly dependent on rainfall. A number of oases lie along the courses of the enneris such as Enneri Yebige, which is virtually unexplored. These oases, which are more numerous {{to the north and}} west of the range, have vegetation of the genera Acacia, Ficus (fig trees), Hyphaene and Tamarix. Most <b>gueltas</b> are lined with macrophytes including Cyperus laevigatus, Equisetum ramosissimum, Juncus fontanesii and Scirpus holoschoenus. Acacia nilotica grow near these water basins. Myrtus nivellei and Nerium oleander grow between elevations of [...] {{in the western part of}} the range, while Tamarix nilotica grow at similar elevations in its northern part.

30|$|Biagetti {{examines}} the Kel Tadrart regional settlement patterns in their wider context, assessing their locations {{in relation to}} natural resources, status and kinship links. Settlement location is identified as being influenced by accessibility to reliable water sources (animals can normally reach the <b>gueltas</b> on their own). In discussing the patterns of residential mobility amongst the Kel Tadrart, Biagetti prefers {{to use the term}} ‘alternative’ campsites, as opposed to ‘seasonal’, as the majority of the households do not follow a regular seasonal mobility pattern. Rather, the use of these sites is irregular and opportunistic (perhaps {{due in part to the}} erratic rains). Biagetti identifies how movements (distances between sites) do tend to be relatively short distance (10 – 40 km) compared to the longer distance movements of other pastoral groups in the Sahel (e.g. Barral 1967). He also notes that fodder can be bought at the regional market, with some households stating they occasionally buy fodder when needed in very dry years, helping to buffer the naturally available resources to maintain higher herd sizes (as noted above, larger herds are kept today than in the 1930 s).|$|R
5|$|Various {{types of}} aquatic {{habitats}} {{are used by}} different crocodilians. Some species are relatively more terrestrial and prefer swamps, ponds, and the edges of lakes, where they can bask {{in the sun and}} there is plenty of plant life supporting a diverse fauna. Others spend more time in the water and inhabit the lower stretches of rivers, mangrove swamps, and estuaries. These habitats also have a rich flora and provide plenty of food. The Asian gharials find the fish on which they feed in the pools and backwaters of swift rivers. South American dwarf caimans inhabit cool, fast-flowing streams, often near waterfalls, and other caimans live in warmer, turbid lakes and slow-moving rivers. The crocodiles are mainly river dwellers, and the Chinese alligator is found in slow-moving, turbid rivers flowing across China's floodplains. The American alligator is an adaptable species and inhabits swamps, rivers, or lakes with clear or turbid water. Climatic factors also affect crocodilians' distribution locally. During the dry season, caimans can be restricted to deep pools in rivers for several months; in the rainy season, much of the savannah in the Venezuelan llanos is flooded, and they disperse widely across the plain. Desert crocodiles in Mauritania have adapted to their arid environment by staying in caves or burrows in a state of aestivation during the driest periods. When it rains, the reptiles gather at <b>gueltas.</b>|$|R
