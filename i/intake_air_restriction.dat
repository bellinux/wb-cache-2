40|$|Abstract: Although driving {{patterns}} strongly influence {{greenhouse gas}} and air pollutant emission rate from light duty vehicles, emission measurements have been mainly based on chassis dynamometer testing with one standard driving pattern. And {{there has been}} limited work on quantifying the independent effect of driving parameters on emission rate because of multidimensional nature of real-world driving pattern. The objective {{of this study is}} to obtain the quantitative effect of relative positive acceleration (RPA) on vehicle emission rate. RPA has been used to define the occurrence of acceleration demanding large amounts of power in certain driving distance and shown to be a significant affecting parameter for real-world emission rate. 40 driving patterns have been developed with fixed driving parameters to investigate independent effect of RPA. For the same values of average vehicle speed and power, the trend in carbon dioxide emission rate and fuel consumption with respect to RPA is very clear. Emission rate of nitrogen oxide and particulate matter also increase with respect to RPA, but the trend is less clear. Carbon dioxide emission from diesel vehicle appear to be more affected by high accelerations compared to that from gasoline vehicle because of high <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> <b>restriction</b> during acceleration caused by turbocharger and intercooler.

Optimized kinetic process (OKP) technology is implemented to realize HCCI combustion in a {{port fuel injection}} gasoline engine. The combustion and emission characteristics are investigated with variation of <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> temperature, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rate and <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> pressure. The results show that <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> temperature has great influence on HCCI combustion characteristic. Increased <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> temperature results in advance combustion phase, shorten combustion duration, and lower indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP). Increased EGR rate retards combustion start phase and prolongs combustion duration, while maximum pressure rising rate and NOx emission are reduced with increase of EGR rate. In the condition with constant fuel flow quantity, increased air pressure leads to retarded combustion phase and lower pressure rising rate, which will reduce the engine knocking tendency. In the condition with constant air fuel ratio condition, fuel injection quantity increases as <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> pressure increases, which lead to high heat release rate and high emission level. The optimal <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> temperature varies in different operating area, which can be tuned from ambient temperature to 220 ℃ by heat management system.

40|$|Abstract: The startability {{of diesel}} engines degrades as the ambient {{temperature}} falls, in particular, to the borderline or lower temperature. The essential cause is {{the deterioration of}} in-cylinder combustion resulting from worsening of combustion conditions. A membrane-based oxygen-enriched <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> (OEA) method is proposed to improve in-cylinder combustion and then to reduce exhaust emissions during the start-up process. This paper investigates the effects of OEA on startability and exhaust emission behaviour during the engine start-up. The experiments were carried out on a direct-injection diesel engine. A membrane-based oxygen-enrichment system was constructed to supply the test engine with <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> containing 21 vol %, 23 vol %, 25 vol %, and 27 vol % oxygen respectively. The in-cylinder pressure, instantaneous engine speed, and time-resolved engine-out emissions were recorded and com-pared for the OEA and the baseline methods (ambient air (AA), 21 vol % oxygen). The results show that, at the high <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> temperature (26 °C), the engine could start smoothly. When the <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> temperature fell to the borderline temperature (5 °C), the startability significantly degraded, in-cylinder incomplete combustion was evident during the initial stage of start-up, and the start-up time increased. With OEA at 5 °C, the startability was markedly improved, and the engine experienced fewer cycles than those at the same <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> temperature with AA before it reached idle operation. With OEA, the engine-out hydrocarbon, CO, and smoke emissions throughout the whole start-up process were all reduced considerably, but NO x emissions evidently increased...|$|R

40|$|This thesis work {{relates to}} an {{intended}} improvement of volumetric efficiency, particularly on lower engine speeds, {{in a direct}} injection turbo charged gasoline engine. It {{has been known for}} a long period of time that heat transfer rate in flow components, such as intake system can have considerable effects on mass flow and consequently volumetric efficiency. There are several ways to enhance the amount of air flowing thru an engine, such as increasing size of intake and exhaust geometries. The modification that will be implemented in this project is not supposed to increase the volume of air that will flow thru the engine, but to a certain extent increase the mass flow of it. This is achieved by decreased <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> temperature which results in increased density and hence increased mass flow of the incoming <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> charge. The area of investigation in this thesis project relates to the fact that heat builds up in the cylinder head and transfers to the intake ports surfaces making them very hot. The main objective is to study how a decreased temperature of the intake ports surfaces influences the temperature of the incoming <b>intake</b> <b>air.</b> To efficiently accomplish such a study, a technical solution which intends to reduce heat transfer to the intake ports surfaces must be developed and isolated intake ports are one example of such a solution. The expected outcome of this solution is that the surface temperatures in the intake ports will be reduced and consequently heat transfer to the incoming <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> charge is reduced to a certain extent. The primary aim of the thesis project is to develop a technical solution that with a great amount prevent heat from transferring to the intake ports surfaces. The secondary aim of this study is to investigate how decreased surface temperature in the intake ports influences the incoming <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> charge temperature. Finally, the results will be compared against measured data, obtained from an identical standard single cylinder head. The intention of reducing the surface temperature in the intake ports is to hopefully answer some questions such as were the highest amount of heat transfer occurs in the intake port, if it mostly occurs over the entire intake port or predominantly near the hot intake valves. The results from the GT-Power engine simulations showed that isolated intake ports obtained a reduced surface temperature in the intake ports. That substantially led to a decreased temperature of the incoming <b>intake</b> <b>air,</b> particularly on lower engine speeds. In the single cylinder experiments it was found that the isolated intake ports were a possible method to reduce the temperature of the incoming <b>intake</b> <b>air.</b> Thus, the result did not become as positive as was indicated from the results of the theoretical simulations. To conclude, the major drawback was experienced during experiment testing, there it was noticed that the standard intake ports did not heat the incoming <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> as much as was expected. This consequently resulted that the initial improvement potential of isolated intake ports influence on <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> was not as great as what is expected from the beginning of the thesis...|$|R
