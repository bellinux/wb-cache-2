40|$|Communities {{of insect}} herbivores and their natural enemies are rich and ecologically crucial {{components}} of terrestrial biodiversity. Understanding {{the processes that}} promote their origin and maintenance is thus of considerable interest. One major proposed mechanism is ecological speciation through host-associated differentiation (HAD), the divergence of a polyphagous species first into ecological host races and eventually into more specialized daughter species. The rich chalcid parasitoid communities attacking cynipid <b>oak</b> <b>gall</b> <b>wasp</b> hosts are structured by multiple host traits, including food plant taxon, host gall phenology, and gall structure. Here, we ask whether the same traits structure genetic diversity within supposedly generalist parasitoid morphospecies. We use mitochondrial DNA sequences and microsatellite genotypes to quantify HAD for Megastigmus (Bootanomyia) dorsalis, a complex of two apparently generalist cryptic parasitoid species attacking <b>oak</b> <b>galls.</b> Ancient Balkan refugial populations showed phenological separation between the cryptic species, one primarily attacking spring galls, and the other mainly attacking autumn galls. The spring species also contained host races specializing on galls developing on different host- plant lineages (sections Cerris vs. Quercus) within the oak genus Quercus. These results indicate more significant host-associated structuring within <b>oak</b> <b>gall</b> parasitoid communities than previously thought and support ecological theory predicting the evolution of specialist lineages within generalist parasitoids. In contrast, UK populations of the autumn cryptic species associated with both native and recently invading <b>oak</b> <b>gall</b> <b>wasps</b> showed no evidence of population differentiation, implying rapid recruitment of native parasitoid populations onto invading hosts, and hence potential for natural biological control. This is of significance given recent rapid range expansion of the economically damaging chestnut <b>gall</b> <b>wasp,</b> Dryocosmus kuriphilus, in Europe...|$|R
40|$|The {{globally}} invasive chestnut <b>gall</b> <b>wasp</b> Dryocosmus kuriphilus {{was recently}} reported in Italy and threatens European chestnut orchards and native forests. Of Chinese origin, this species has invaded Japan, Korea, the USA, Nepal and Europe {{and in each}} region it has been attacked by parasitoids exploiting <b>oak</b> <b>gall</b> <b>wasps.</b> Classical biological control using the parasitoid Torymus sinensis (Hymenoptera: Torymidae) successfully reduced infestation in Japan. Subsequent work in Japan and Korea showed this parasitoid to represent a poorly understood and biologically diverse species complex. Following its success in Japan, T. sinensis was released in Italy in 2005. A growing appreciation of the taxonomic and ecological complexity of the T. sinensis complex in Japan and Korea has stimulated ongoing DNA-based work on relationships and interbreeding of species in this group. Oak cynipid parasitoids provide potential for native augmentative or conservation biological control of D. kuriphilus in Europe. Exploitation of this potential requires improved understanding of the taxonomy of these parasitoids, particularly of morphologically highly conserved lineages such as Eurytoma and Eupelmus in which recognised species may contain many cryptic lineages. There is a growing need for a molecular survey of the communities centered on chestnut and <b>oak</b> <b>gall</b> <b>wasps</b> to: (1) ascertain the identity of T. sinensis lineages released in Italy (2) track the dispersal of T. sinensis in the native community, either in its original form or as hybrids with native species (3) identify possible biological control agents in the native parasitoid community...|$|R

Inferential tools for historical demography given these data sets are, at present, underdeveloped. In particular, approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) has yet to be widely embraced by researchers generating these data. Here, we demonstrate the promise of ABC for analysis of the large data sets that are now attainable from nonmodel taxa through current genomic sequencing technologies. We develop and test an ABC framework for model selection and parameter estimation, given histories of three-population divergence with admixture. We then explore different sampling regimes to illustrate how sampling more loci, longer loci or more individuals affects the quality of model selection and parameter estimation in this ABC framework. Our results show that inferences improved substantially with increases in the number and/or length of sequenced loci, while less benefit was gained by sampling large numbers of individuals. Optimal sampling strategies given our inferential models included at least 2000 loci, each approximately 2  kb in length, sampled from five diploid individuals per population, although specific strategies are model and question dependent.

40|$|Cynipid <b>gall</b> <b>wasps</b> have {{fascinating}} biology {{that has}} piqued {{the interest of}} naturalists throughout history. They induce morphologically complex, sometimes spectacular, gall structures on plants in which the larval stages develop. <b>Gall</b> <b>wasps</b> have therefore evolved an intimate association with their hosts - both metabolically, {{and in terms of}} their population histories. <b>Gall</b> <b>wasps</b> must both interact physiologically with their hosts to induce galls, and track their host plants through space and time. My thesis centres on two uses of genomic data in understanding the biology of the <b>oak</b> apple <b>gall</b> <b>wasp</b> Biorhiza pallida. I provide a comprehensive investigation into patterns of <b>oak</b> and <b>gall</b> <b>wasp</b> gene expression associated with gall induction, and a population genomic reconstruction of the population history of this species across the Western Palaearctic. While advances in sequencing technology and reduced costs have made these aims possible, analysis of the massive resulting datasets generated creates new challenges. Firstly, in reconstructing the population history of B. pallida, I describe the use of shotgun sequencing and an informatic pipeline to generate alignments of several thousand loci for three B. pallida individuals sampled from putative glacial refugia across the Western Palaearctic in Iberia, the Balkans and Iran. This dataset was analysed using a new maximum likelihood method capable of estimating population splitting and admixture among refugia across very large numbers of loci. The results showed an ancient divide between Iberia and the other two refugia, followed by very recent admixture between easternmost and westernmost regions. This suggests that <b>gall</b> <b>wasps</b> have migrated westwards along the North African coast as well as through mainland Europe. Second, I compare the gene expression profiles of <b>gall</b> <b>wasp</b> and <b>oak</b> tissues sampled from each of three stages of gall development, leading to new insights into potential mechanisms of gall wasp-oak interaction. A highly expressed <b>gall</b> <b>wasp</b> protein was identified that is hypothesised to stimulate somatic embryogenesis-like development of the gall through interaction with oak tissue glycoproteins. Highly expressed oak genes include those coding for nodulin-like proteins similar to those involved in legume nodule formation. Finally, analysis of the <b>gall</b> <b>wasp</b> genome has revealed potential, but as yet unconfirmed, horizontal gene transfer events into <b>gall</b> <b>wasp</b> genomes. Genes discovered in three <b>gall</b> <b>wasp</b> genomes and expressed in three transcriptomes encode plant cell wall degrading enzymes. They are not of hymenopteran origin, and are most homologous to genes of plant pathogenic bacteria. These genes could be involved in several aspects of <b>gall</b> <b>wasp</b> biology, including feeding and developmental manipulation of host plant tissue...|$|R

There are two competing hypotheses, “Out of America” vs. “Out ofAsia”, for interpreting the origin of oak gallwasps and Asian materials play a key rolein testing these hypotheses. However, up to 2009, only 34 valid oak gallwasp speciesin eastern Palearctic were described, whereas only one invaded pest species wasrecorded in Oriental region and none was reported in Taiwan.

Previous names or synonyms for the species A. fecundator are A. fecundatrix, A. pilosus, A. foecundatrix (see below), A. gemmarum, A. gemmae, A. gemmaequercus, A. gemmaecinaraeformis and A. quercusgemmae.|$|R

40|$|A {{quantitative}} {{catalogue of}} the parasitoids (almost exclusively Chalcidoidea) and inquiline Cynipidae recorded in the western Palaearctic from galls induced on Quercus by Cynipidae (Cynipini) is presented. Quantitative and national data are included with bibliographic references to almost all records published in 2011 and earlier. The catalogue is followed by two checklists, firstly one of the Chalcidoidea with numbers of each species recorded from each type of host gall (galls of the sexual and asexual generations of the host <b>gall</b> <b>wasps</b> are listed separately), and secondly one of inquiline Cynipidae with host galls. Compared to non-oak <b>gall</b> <b>wasps,</b> the Cynipini support a much larger parasitoid and especially inquiline fauna, and this fauna is very largely restricted at the species level to Cynipini galls. About one hundred chalcidoid species are recorded from galls of Cynipini, distributed over six families: Pteromalidae and Eulophidae (29 species each), Torymidae (21 species), Eurytomidae (10 species), Eupelmidae (8 species) and Ormyridae (at least 2 species). Polyphagy is usualin the chalcidoid parasitoids, most species having a broad host gall range, but quantitatively the fauna of each type of <b>oak</b> <b>gall</b> is rather characteristic and is strongly influenced by gall morphology, situation on the tree, season of growth and host tree species. These and other extrinsic factors restrict the full exploitation of the chalcidoids’ potential host gall range...|$|R
