5|$|In 2000, on the {{hundredth}} anniversary of both Hesketh-Prichard's trip and the newspaper's founding, the Daily Express despatched his great-grandson Charlie Jacoby to retrace <b>his</b> <b>footsteps.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{legacy that}} he left behind him is {{preserved}} by the Johannes Rebmann Foundation, a religious society devoted to Rebmann and his memory. Rebmann's work in Africa, both as a missionary and as an explorer, allowed other Europeans to follow in <b>his</b> <b>footsteps.</b>|$|E
5|$|Los Espantos {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{examples}} of an identical trio, where all three members of the team used the same name, mask and wrestling gear only distinguished by a number. After his retirement he trained his sons for a professional wrestling career, and the later followed in <b>his</b> <b>footsteps</b> as Espanto IV and Espanto V.|$|E
60|$|Annette remembered {{having heard}} him go out. She could always tell <b>his</b> <b>footstep.</b>|$|R
6000|$|He falters on the threshold, [...] She lingers on the stair: [...] Can it be {{that was}} <b>his</b> <b>footstep?</b> [...] Can {{it be that}} she is there? ...|$|R

5|$|Because {{his brother}} Orlando {{had become a}} medical doctor, Hugo decided at first to follow in <b>his</b> <b>footsteps.</b> At age seventeen, he left school and {{enrolled}} at Birmingham Medical School. However, it was Orlando who suggested that Hugo should enroll at the University of Alabama School of Law. After graduating in June 1906, he moved back to Ashland and established a legal practice. His practice was not successful there, so Black moved to Birmingham in 1907 where he specialized in labor law and personal injury cases.|$|E
5|$|Burnham's {{descendants}} {{followed in}} <b>his</b> <b>footsteps</b> and {{are active in}} Scouting and in the military. His son Roderick enlisted in the U.S. Army and he fought in France in World War I. His grandson, Frederick Russell Burnham II, was {{a leader in the}} BSA and a Vietnam War veteran. His great-grandson, Russell Adam Burnham, is an Eagle Scout and was the United States Army's Soldier of the Year in 2003.|$|E
5|$|He was {{a pioneer}} in long-distance running. Mamo Wolde, Juma Ikangaa, Tegla Loroupe, Paul Tergat, and Haile Gebrselassie—all {{recipients}} of the New York Road Runners' Abebe Bikila Award—are {{a few of the}} athletes who have followed in <b>his</b> <b>footsteps</b> to establish East Africa as a force in long-distance running. Abebe participated in a total of sixteen marathons, winning twelve and finishing fifth in the 1963 Boston Marathon. In July 1967, he sustained the first of several sports-related leg injuries which prevented him from finishing his last two marathons.|$|E
60|$|In {{a minute}} more, I heard <b>his</b> <b>footstep</b> in the hall. He opened the breakfast-room door, {{and stood on}} the threshold, with a small traveling-bag in his hand.|$|R
50|$|Following in <b>his</b> father's <b>footsteps,</b> <b>his</b> son Tommy {{became the}} 2010 Indoor Heptathlon champion, {{also for the}} University of Georgia.|$|R

5|$|Benedetto Pistrucci {{was born}} in Rome on 24 May 1783, second child and son of Federico Pistrucci, Senior Judge of the High Criminal Court under the papal government, and Antonia (née Greco). His elder brother Filippo {{displayed}} artistic tendencies from a young age, but Benedetto showed mainly a disinclination to study. Federico Pistrucci wanted his sons to follow in <b>his</b> <b>footsteps</b> {{and sent them to}} Latin schools. Benedetto began his education in Bologna, where the family had property, but the Pistrucci family was forced to move to Rome in 1794 when Napoleon invaded Italy, and the boys were enrolled in the Roman College.|$|E
5|$|Bruce Oram Davidson (born December 31, 1949, in Rome, New York) is an American equestrian who competes in {{the sport}} of eventing. He {{grew up in a}} family uninterested in horses, but began to compete in Pony Club events after a family friend {{introduced}} him to riding. He began college at Iowa State University, but left in his third year to train full-time with the United States Equestrian Team. In 1974 he married, and his two children were born in 1976 and 1977. His son, Bruce Davidson, Jr., has followed in <b>his</b> <b>footsteps</b> to become a top eventing rider.|$|E
5|$|By 23BC, {{some of the}} un-Republican {{implications}} {{were becoming}} apparent concerning the settlement of 27BC. Augustus' retention of an annual consulate drew attention to his de facto dominance over the Roman political system, and cut in half the opportunities for others to achieve what was still nominally the preeminent position in the Roman state. Further, he was causing political problems by desiring to have his nephew Marcus Claudius Marcellus follow in <b>his</b> <b>footsteps</b> and eventually assume the Principate in his turn, alienating his three greatest supporters– Agrippa, Maecenas, and Livia. Feeling pressure from his core group of adherents, Augustus turned to the Senate for help.|$|E
60|$|At {{the sound}} of <b>his</b> <b>footstep</b> she turned, and as her eyes met the gray ones of the man she stood poised as though of half a mind to fly. For a moment neither spoke.|$|R
6000|$|... "What!" [...] exclaimed the colonel, starting, [...] "has that recreant youth {{dared to}} pollute the {{threshold}} of St. Ruth with <b>his</b> <b>footstep?</b> but you dream, Kit; there {{would be too much}} hardihood in the act." ...|$|R
50|$|His son, Omer, has {{followed}} in <b>his</b> father's <b>footsteps.</b> <b>His</b> brother in law is Avi Cohen, former international footballer, and his nephew is Tamir Cohen.|$|R
5|$|Determined to save Marceline, Finn and Jake {{disguise}} {{themselves as}} demons and sneak {{back into the}} Nightosphere by creating a portal that sends them to the seat of government for Marceline's regime. Marceline, in her evil demon form, listens to the requests of her subjects, often ignoring what they seek and instead punishing them with macabre torture. Finn and Jake are spotted by Marceline, who gives chase. After narrowly avoiding their demonic friend, the duo run into the now-benign Hunson Abadeer, who explains that he only wanted Marceline to follow in <b>his</b> <b>footsteps</b> and rule the hellish realm.|$|E
5|$|Homer becomes {{depressed}} {{after learning}} {{he has lived}} past the halfway point of the average life expectancy for men without accomplishing anything worthwhile. His family tries to cheer him up by showing him a film of his accomplishments and a special appearance by the character KITT from the Knight Rider television series that Homer is a fan of. When the film projector stops working, Lisa mentions that Thomas Edison invented the projector and many other inventions. Homer decides {{to learn more about}} Edison and eventually idolizes him. In an attempt to follow <b>his</b> <b>footsteps,</b> he quits his job at the power plant to become an inventor.|$|E
5|$|The first Hispanic {{to serve}} in the United States Revenue Cutter Service, {{predecessor}} to the Coast Guard, was Juan Andreu who from 1824 to 1845 served as the Keeper of the St. Augustine Lighthouse in Florida, thus making him also the first Hispanic to oversee a U.S. federal installation of any kind. Maria Andreu (a.k.a. Maria Mestre de los Dolores), a family member, followed in <b>his</b> <b>footsteps</b> and served as Keeper of the same lighthouse from 1859 to 1862, becoming the first Hispanic-American woman {{to serve in}} the Coast Guard (USRCS) and the first Hispanic-American woman to command a U.S. federal shore installation.|$|E
60|$|There were {{sometimes}} dances by moonlight on the lawn, but never {{since he came}} from Rome did Donatello's presence deepen the blushes of the pretty contadinas, or <b>his</b> <b>footstep</b> weary out the most agile partner or competitor, as once it was sure to do.|$|R
60|$|As he had {{hitherto}} {{very seldom}} smoked his pipe in the kitchen, <b>his</b> <b>footstep</b> {{in the passage}} caused O'Donel's very marrow to quake. He turned as pale as death and became rigid with terror, so that he resembled nothing but an Irish statue of very dirty and discoloured marble.|$|R

5|$|Though {{he would}} later become indelibly {{associated}} with Stoke City, Matthews grew up supporting that club's local rivals Port Vale. His father wanted him to follow in <b>his</b> <b>footsteps</b> and become a boxer, but Stanley decided {{at the age of}} 13 {{that he wanted to be}} a footballer. After a rigorous training session that made Matthews vomit, his mother, Elizabeth, stood firm and made Jack realise that his son, who had one more year at school, should follow his passion of football. His father conceded that should he be picked for England Schoolboys then he could continue his footballing career; around this time his school football master picked Matthews as an outside-right, rather than as his then-preferred position of centre-half. Matthews played for England Schoolboys against Wales in 1929, in front of around 20,000 spectators at Dean Court, Bournemouth.|$|E
5|$|According to oral history, Rainilaiarivony {{was born}} on a {{day of the week}} {{traditionally}} viewed as inauspicious for births. Custom in much of Madagascar dictated that such unlucky children had to be subjected to a trial by ordeal, such as prolonged exposure to the elements, since it was believed the misfortune of their day of birth would ensure a short and cursed life for the child and its family. But rather than leave the child to die, Rainilaiarivony's father reportedly followed the advice of an ombiasy (astrologer) and instead amputated a joint from two fingers on his infant son's left hand to dispel the ill omen. The infant was nonetheless kept outside the house to avert the possibility that evil might still befall the family if the child remained under their roof. Relatives took pity and adopted Rainilaiarivony to raise him within their own home. Meanwhile, Rainilaiarivony's older brother Rainivoninahitriniony enjoyed the double privilege of his status as elder son and freedom from a predestined evil fate. Rainiharo selected and groomed his elder son to follow in <b>his</b> <b>footsteps</b> as Commander-in-Chief and Prime Minister, while Rainilaiarivony was left to make his way in the world by his own merits.|$|E
5|$|Over {{much of her}} childhood, Michelena’s parents toured {{with the}} Emma Abbott Grand Opera Company a {{traveling}} theatre company that performed famous operas translated to English for American audiences. Beatriz's father in later life taught music {{and worked as a}} vocal coach and, {{at the time of his}} death, was serving as president of Arrillaga Musical College, San Francisco. Beatriz and her sister Vera were trained by their father in classical voice and drama studies, and they followed in <b>his</b> <b>footsteps</b> by beginning singing careers of their own. Vera first appeared onstage in the Princess Chic Opera company (1901) at 17, taking a leading role in The Man from China (1904). Beatriz, too, performed with Princess Chic in 1901, taking chorus roles suitable for a child of 11. By mid-1904, with Vera busy pursuing her career in New York, Fernando Michelena settled in San Francisco, California to teach voice. There, he raised Beatriz and continued to train her, a soprano, in operatic vocal techniques. He passed his stage experience to his daughter: the way to move as another person, the way to make simple but authoritative gestures, and the way to build intensity over the span of a performance. Maria Antonia Field, a Californian writer, would later chronicle her time as a student of Michelena’s father in her book, Five Years of Vocal Study under Fernando Michelena.|$|E

6000|$|He stopped, he turned, {{she waved}} her hand wildly, and then leaning her arm on the table, {{buried her face in}} it.

At length he said, in a still yet clear voice, 'I am here.' ...|$|R

5|$|Miller went to {{the local}} state school before {{transferring}} to Melbourne High Schoola selective government institution that accepted students through an academic examat the start of 1934. The school's emphasis on scholastic and sporting excellence and its culture was {{more in line with}} that of a private school than a standard government school. Australian Test captain Bill Woodfull was on the teaching staff as Miller's mathematics teacher.}} Because he did little study and focused his energy on sport, Miller was a mediocre student.Perry, p. 18. In addition to cricket and football, Miller played baseball and competed in swimming. This disappointed Woodfull, a disciplined man who invoked the school's motto Honour the Work in exhorting his students to work hard as Australia was attempting to emerge from the depths of the Great Depression. Despite being Australia's captain, Woodfull refused to involve himself in the coaching of the school's cricket teams, feeling that it would intrude on the responsibilities of the sports teachers. Despite this, Woodfull watched the students at cricket training and quickly noticed Miller's skills. Aged 14 and still under , Miller was selected in the school's First XI. With his pads flapping against his stomach and sporting a sawn-down bat, Miller batted at No. 6 and scored 44 on his senior debut. Although his lack of power was obvious, Miller's control and solidity prompted the spectators to call him the Unbowlable, the same nickname that was accorded to Woodfull, who had a similarly strong defensive style. Melbourne {{went on to win the}} match,Perry, p. 20. and Miller impressed his captain Keith Truscott, who fought for his selection and took him under his wing. Truscott later became an ace fighter pilot in the Royal Australian Air Force, and Miller would follow in <b>his</b> <b>footsteps.</b> Truscott's social influence compounded the distractions from Miller's study. Miller failed all eight of his subjects at the end of 1934, and with an average mark of 25%, was the class dunce. He scored zero in his final exam for Woodfull's geometry class,Perry, p. 21. and was forced to repeat year 9.|$|E
