5|$|Aigler {{also played}} an {{important}} role in securing the Big Ten's long-term contract with the Rose Bowl. Prior to the 1947 season, the visiting spot <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rose</b> Bowl was open to all conferences, and the Big Ten champion only appeared <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rose</b> Bowl on rare occasions. In November 1946, Aigler was appointed to a five-person steering committee assigned to negotiate an exclusive contract with the Rose Bowl. The Big Ten approved the exclusive arrangement by a vote of 7 to 2, with Illinois and Minnesota the only opponents. The relationship was negotiated at meetings between Aigler and the Big Ten steering committee and the Pacific Coast Conference held in Berkeley, California in November 1946. Aigler traveled to California again in May 1947 with William Reed to negotiate administrative details of the Rose Bowl arrangement with Pacific Coast Conference representative William C. Ackerman. The University of Michigan was the first Big Ten participant in the new Rose Bowl arrangement, defeating the USC Trojans 490 in the game held on January 1, 1948.|$|E

5|$|The 1948 Michigan Wolverines {{football}} team went 90 and outscored their opponents 252 to 44. The defensive unit led by Dworsky held its opponents to just 4.9points per game, including shutouts against Oregon (140), Purdue (400), Northwestern (280), Navy (350), and Indiana (540). The 1948 Wolverines finished the season ranked No. 1 by the AP, but Big Ten Conference rules prohibited {{a team from}} playing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rose</b> Bowl {{two years in a}} row. Dworsky did, however, play in the 1948 Blue-Gray All Star game.|$|E
50|$|Eric Ball, a {{freshman}} tailback for UCLA, ran for 227 yards and tied a modern Rose Bowl record by scoring four rushing touchdowns. Sam Cunningham ran for four touchdowns <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1973 <b>Rose</b> Bowl. Eric was <b>in</b> for <b>the</b> injured Gaston Green, who had started, but pulled a hamstring. This record has been tied by Ron Dayne <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1999 <b>Rose</b> Bowl and Vince Young <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2006 <b>Rose</b> Bowl. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1902 <b>Rose</b> Bowl, Neil Snow of Michigan had scored five rushing touchdowns.|$|R

5|$|Virginia Tech's {{victory was}} just its second bowl win {{in school history}} and brought the Hokies to a final 1993 record of 93.

5|$|At {{the end of}} World War I, Vanity Fair {{writers and}} Algonquin regulars Dorothy Parker, Robert Benchley, and Robert E. Sherwood started meeting for lunch at The Algonquin. Alexander Woollcott, acerbic critic and war correspondent, {{received}} a warm welcome from literary friends in 1919. They gathered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rose</b> Room that afternoon; one person enjoyed the event enough to request that it become a daily event. That same request prompted a daily exchange of ideas and opinions shared between highly esteemed literary figures. George S.

They founded The New Yorker magazine; all hotel guests receive free copies to this day.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, Shaughnessy hired {{his former}} {{teammate}} Bernie Bierman {{as an assistant}} coach. Bierman remained on the staff for three seasons before he left to become head coach at Mississippi A. In 1924, Tulane set a new school record for wins and finished with an 8–1 record. The following season, the Green Wave bested the prior year's mark and posted a 9–0–1 record. School officials declined an invitation to face Washington <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rose</b> Bowl, because they believed the Tulane players were too small. Indiana University attempted to hire Shaughnessy after his undefeated season, but he instead chose to sign a ten-year extension with Tulane.|$|E

5|$|Lochner is {{associated}} with three surviving books of hours; in Darmstadt, Berlin and Anholt. The extent of his association in each is debated; workshop members were probably heavily involved in their production. The most famous is the early 1450s Prayer book of Stephan Lochner now at Darmstadt; the others are the Berlin Book of Prayers of c. 1444, and the Anholt Prayerbook, completed in the 1450s. The manuscripts are very small (Berlin: 9.3cm x 7cm, Darmstadt: 10.7cm x 8cm, Anholt: 9cm x 8cm) and similar in layout and colourisation and are each extensively decorated in gold and blue. The borders are ornamented in bright colours and contain acanthus scrolls, gold foliage, flowers, berry-like fruits and round pods. The Darmstadt book includes a complete cycle of the Martyrdom of the Apostles. Its illustrations contain Lochner's characteristic application of deep blue, reminiscent of his Virgin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rose</b> Garden.|$|E
5|$|Since its founding, The Wilderness Society {{has helped}} pass many bills for {{preservation}} and conservation of public lands. It has also purchased lands for preservation, contributing {{a total of}} 109millionacres (421,000km2) to the National Wilderness Preservation System. Marshall's dream of permanent wilderness protection became a reality 25years after his death when President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Wilderness Act into law on September 3, 1964 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rose</b> Garden of the White House. The ceremony was attended by Alice Zahniser and Mardy Murie, the widows of two prominent members of The Wilderness Society.|$|E
5|$|The Washington Huskies had outscored {{their opponents}} 20337 {{during the regular}} season, {{excluding}} the games against New York and Mississippi. Washington's running backs, George Wilson and Elmer Tesreau, led their offense during the season, each gaining several hundred rushing yards. However, Tesreau was suffering from boils on his knee, and his coaches urged him to not play <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rose</b> Bowl. The Washington defense was considered superior to that of Navy, being much larger on average. Washington's defense had been very effective during the regular season, holding five teams scoreless and allowing more than ten points to be scored against them only once.

5|$|The {{apple tree}} (Malus pumila, {{commonly}} and erroneously called Malus domestica) is a deciduous tree <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rose</b> family {{best known for}} its sweet, pomaceous fruit, the apple. It is cultivated worldwide as a fruit tree, and is the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe, and were brought to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek and European Christian traditions.|$|E
5|$|A {{week after}} the loss <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rose</b> Bowl, Reggie Bush {{announced}} his plans to skip his senior season and declare for the 2006 NFL Draft. Along with Bush, ten other Trojans were drafted.

Three players were taken in the second round, Winston Justice by Philadelphia, Taitusi Lutui by Arizona, and LenDale White by Tennessee, and two more were taken in the third round, Frostee Rucker to Cincinnati and Dominique Byrd by St. Louis to end {{the first day of}} the draft.

Ebsary scored 211 runs during the 2009–10 WNCL season to retain her position in the national squad for the Rose Bowl series, but after a series of poor performances, she spent the latter half of the campaign watching from the sidelines.|$|E
