This was some three weeks prior to the release of Star Wars. Several explanations for the cancellation have been put forth. One claims the studio felt that the production had taken too long and another science fiction film would not be successful so soon after Star Wars because the fans would not pay to see two science fiction films. Kaufmann later claimed that Paramount had attributed the cancellation to the success of Star Wars at the box office, but as Titans was cancelled prior to Star Wars release the box office could not have played a factor. Diller stated that it was cancelled because both treatments felt forced and different from the episodes of The Original Series. He instead suggested that they returned to the series format and therefore moved forward with a project that would become the never-completed [...] TV series Kaufmann went on to direct films such as Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978) and The Right Stuff (1983).

[...] Timberlake revealed that he went [...] "left", regarding going more rock, not in how he developed the song, but in the way he sang the song. [...] "I wanted to sing the song like a rock and roll singer, not an R singer. That's the approach." [...] The day before recording, Timberlake and Timbaland had listened to David Bowie's [...] "Rebel Rebel" [...] and the Rapture's [...] "House of Jealous Lovers". Timberlake wanted to achieve the songs' [...] "raw energy".
