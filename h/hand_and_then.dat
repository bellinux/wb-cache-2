5|$|A {{photograph}} from Leon's {{apartment and}} the snake scale lead Deckard to {{a strip club}} where Zhora works. After a confrontation and chase, Deckard kills Zhora. Bryant orders him to also retire Rachael, who has disappeared from the Tyrell Corporation. After Deckard spots Rachael in a crowd, he is attacked by Leon, who knocks Deckard's pistol from his <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> begins to kill Deckard, but Rachael uses Deckard's pistol to kill Leon. They return to Deckard's apartment, and, during an intimate discussion, he promises not to track her down; as she abruptly tries to leave, Deckard restrains her, forcing her to kiss him.|$|E
5|$|The unique {{melting point}} of gallium {{allows it to}} melt in the human <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> refreeze if removed. The liquid metal has a strong {{tendency}} to supercool below its melting point/freezing point. Seeding with a crystal helps to initiate freezing. Gallium {{is one of the}} four metals (with caesium, rubidium, and mercury) that are known to be liquid at, or near, normal room temperature. Of the four, gallium {{is the only one that}} is neither highly reactive nor highly toxic and can therefore be used in metal-in-glass high-temperature thermometers. It is also notable for having one of the largest liquid ranges for a metal, and for having (unlike mercury) a low vapor pressure at high temperatures. Gallium's boiling point, 2673K, is more than eight times higher than its melting point on the absolute scale, the greatest ratio between melting point and boiling point of any element. Unlike mercury, liquid gallium metal wets glass and skin, along with most other materials (with the exceptions of quartz, graphite, and Teflon), making it mechanically more difficult to handle even though it is substantially less toxic and requires far fewer precautions. Gallium painted onto glass is a brilliant mirror. For this reason as well as the metal contamination and freezing-expansion problems, samples of gallium metal are usually supplied in polyethylene packets within other containers.|$|E

25|$|The size of {{the flame}} can be {{adjusted}} to a limited extent by the valves on the torch and by the regulator settings, but in the main {{it depends on the}} {{size of the}} orifice in the tip. In fact, the tip should be chosen first according to the job at <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> the regulators set accordingly.|$|E
25|$|Drawing {{continues}} {{until everyone}} has drawn 25 cards and {{a pool of}} reserve cards (usually consisting of about eight cards), remains. The dealer then picks up all the cards, integrates them into his <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> discards {{the same number of}} cards into a pile in the center, known as the kitty. These cards are kept unopened throughout the duration of that round and {{may or may not be}} turned over thereafter, depending on the result of the last trick in the round.|$|E

Richardson then served as U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts from 1959 to 1961, {{and was later}} elected the Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts and Attorney General of Massachusetts. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1958.|$|E
25|$|Beach Volleyball {{takes place}} at Waveside. Players serve by making an upward {{throwing}} motion with one <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> a swinging motion with the other. The ball is passed or returned using bump, set and spike motions. Single player, local multiplayer and online multiplayer game modes are available. Beach Volleyball mini games include Bump Bash, in which the player must avoid as many thrown objects as possible, and Body Ball, where the player is required to return the ball using a specific body part.|$|E
25|$|According to Robert Zydendos, karma in Jainism can be {{considered}} a kind of system of laws, but natural rather than moral laws. In Jainism, actions that carry moral significance are considered to cause certain consequences in just the same way as, for instance, physical actions that do not carry any special moral significance. When one holds an apple in one's <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> let go of the apple, the apple will fall: this is only natural. There is no judge, and no moral judgment involved, since this is a mechanical consequence of the physical action.|$|E

25|$|Black pepper is {{produced}} from the still-green, unripe drupes of the pepper plant. The drupes are cooked briefly in hot water, both to clean {{them and to}} prepare them for drying. The heat ruptures cell walls in the pepper, speeding the work of browning enzymes during drying. The drupes dry in the sun or by machine for several days, during which the pepper around the seed shrinks and darkens into a thin, wrinkled black layer. Once dry, the spice is called black peppercorn. On some estates, the berries are separated from the stem by <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> sun-dried without the boiling process.|$|E
25|$|Tournée: To {{determine}} trump, declarer {{picks up}} one card of the skat {{and looks at}} it. If declarer wants this card's suit as trump, the card is shown to the other players. Otherwise the hand is played as Passt mir nicht (it doesn't suit me) and the other card in the skat is turned up to determine trump. A jack gives declarer the choice of either playing grand (jacks only) or the jack's suit as trump. Once trump has been determined, both the skat cards are added to declarer's <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> two are removed and placed face down to begin his or her pile of cards won.|$|E
25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} they bound the Red Cow with a bast rope {{and placed it}} on the pile with its head towards the south and its face towards the west. The priest stood on the east side facing west. He {{slaughtered}} the cow with his right hand and received the blood with his left hand. But Rabbi Judah said that he received the blood with his right hand, put it on his left <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> sprinkled with his right hand. He dipped his finger in the blood and sprinkled it towards the Holy of Holies seven times, dipping once for each sprinkling.|$|E

25|$|In some {{versions}} of pinochle, after the bid {{has been taken}} and trump declared in a partnership game, the bid winning team exchanges cards. It may be two, three, or four cards, depending on the version of the game. The partner of the bid winner passes first. The objective of the partner is either {{to add to the}} total points in meld or to pass trick-winning cards. After receiving the cards, the bid winner examines what will create the strongest <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> discards an equal number of cards back to their partner. Variations are for the bid winner and partner to exchange the designated number of cards simultaneously, or for no passing to occur.|$|E
25|$|Kitty: In {{games with}} players where the cards cannot be dealt evenly, {{there is a}} {{variation}} in which no cards are removed from the deck, but instead a kitty composed of the leftover cards (or one trick's worth of cards plus the leftovers) is placed at center. Whoever is dealt the 2, or alternatively, the player with the highest bid (tie-breaker being first to make that bid), picks up the kitty before bidding begins, integrates it into their <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> discards {{the same number of}} cards. If a round of cards in addition to the leftovers is placed in the kitty, the discard by the player who picked up the kitty counts as a trick. This introduces more uncertainty in bids because usually the person with the kitty tries to void one suit and trump earlier in the game.|$|E
25|$|Competition {{shooters}} {{also often}} sort bullets by weight, often down to 0.10 grain (6.5mg) increments. The bullet {{is placed in}} the case mouth by <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> seated with the press. At this point, the expanded case mouth is also sized back down. A crimp can optionally be added, either by the seating die or with a separate die. Taper crimps are used for cases that are held in the chamber by the case mouth, while roll crimps may be used for cases that headspace on a rim or on the cartridge neck. Roll crimps hold the bullet far more securely, and are preferred in situations, such as magnum revolvers, where recoil velocities are significant. A tight crimp also helps to delay the start of the bullet's motion, which can increase chamber pressures, and help develop full power from slower burning powders (see internal ballistics).|$|E

25|$|Hera prays to Gaia, who stirs {{her sons}} the Giants to fight Dionysus {{and they are}} slain. Dionysus wrestles with the {{daughter}} of King Sithon to win her <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> slays the king when he wins. Dionysus goes to Asia Minor where he meets the nymph Aura. Aura vies with Artemis in a beauty contest, and Artemis, in spite, has Nemesis make Dionysus {{fall in love with}} Aura and pursue her. Ariadne appears to Dionysus in a dream and complains that he has forgotten her. Dionysus rapes Aura as she sleeps; when she awakes she goes mad and slaughters shepherds and destroys a shrine of Aphrodite. Artemis mocks the pregnant Aura as Nicaea helps her give birth to the twins after whom Mt. Dindymon is named. Aura tries to get a lion to eat the children, but they are saved and she is transformed into a spring. One of the children, Iacchus is given to Athena, Ariadne's crown is made a constellation, and Dionysus is enthroned on Olympus.|$|E
25|$|CBS did {{not believe}} that KKR would sell WTVJ to another network, so it {{returned}} with a very low offer. KKR turned CBS's offer down almost out of <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> approached the other networks. ABC was not interested, since it was more than satisfied with its longtime affiliate, WPLG. However, NBC was very interested because its longtime affiliate, WSVN, heavily preempted the network's daytime lineup—including programs that the network aired in the noon timeslot in favor of running a local newscast, as well as an occasional prime time show. NBC was far less tolerant of preemptions than CBS and ABC at the time, and was particularly annoyed at losing valuable advertising in such a fast-growing market. This had not been a problem at first since most of the programs that were preempted by WSVN aired on West Palm Beach-based WPTV, which provided at least grade B signal coverage to nearly the entire Miami-Fort Lauderdale market, and had been available on cable in the area for decades. In the few cases where WPTV and WSVN both turned down an NBC program, the network usually arranged for other stations in the area to carry its programming. However, by 1985, WPTV had been dropped from most Miami cable systems to make way for new cable channels (partly due to limited headend channel capacity), resulting in some NBC programs that were preempted by WSVN being unavailable to some viewers. NBC realized that purchasing its own station with less restrictive ownership laws would guarantee that all of its shows would make it to air. Hence, it made an offer almost as high as Telepictures did a few months before, and in 1987, KKR agreed to sell WTVJ to NBC for $270 million.|$|E
