In the mid-2000s, export of unprocessed soybeans and of soybean oil and meal generated more than 20% of Argentina's export revenue, triple the joint {{share of the}} traditional exports, beef and wheat. <b>Export</b> <b>taxes</b> comprised 8% to 11% of the Kirchner government's total tax receipts, around two-thirds of which came from soy exports. Taxes on imports and exports increased government spending from 14% to 25% of GDP. However, the import and <b>export</b> <b>taxes</b> have discouraged foreign investment, while high spending has pushed inflation over 20%.|$|E
5|$|In September 2010, China {{temporarily}} blocked all {{exports of}} rare earths to Japan {{in the midst}} of a diplomatic dispute between the two countries. These minerals are used in hybrid cars and other products such wind turbines and guided missiles, thereby augmenting the worries about the dependence on Chinese rare-earth elements and the need for geographic diversity of supply. A December 2010 report published by the US DoE found that the American economy vulnerable to rare-earth shortages and estimates that it could take 15 years to overcome dependence on Chinese supplies. China raised <b>export</b> <b>taxes</b> for some rare earths from 15 to 25%, and also extended taxes to exports of some rare-earth alloys that were not taxed before. The Chinese government also announced further reductions on its export quotas for the first months of 2011, which represent a 35% reduction in tonnage as compared to exports during the first half of 2010.|$|E

The transition from Néstor Kirchner to Cristina Fernández de Kirchner was also the first time a democratic head of state was replaced by their spouse without the death of either. He remained highly influential during his wife's term, supervising the economy and leading the PJ. Their marriage has been compared with those of Juan and Eva Perón and Bill and Hillary Clinton. Media observers suspected that Mr. Kirchner stepped down as president to circumvent the term limit, swapping roles with his wife.|$|E
40|$|The log {{export policy}} {{suggestion}} by Dumont and Wright (2006) is critically assessed {{in an effort}} to determine if it is based on economic efficiency. The optimal log export policy for British Columbia is derived using two different models. The first model assumes that B. C. is a small open economy, and the second is a two country model that provides B. C. the opportunity to improve its terms of trade. In both cases it is shown that an optimal log <b>export</b> <b>tax</b> when a fixed lumber <b>export</b> <b>tax</b> exists can be characterized as a problem of second best. In that scenario the optimal log export policy is a positive <b>export</b> <b>tax</b> in both models. In the second model a positive <b>export</b> <b>tax</b> is also optimal when there is no lumber <b>export</b> <b>tax,</b> but it is smaller than when the lumber <b>export</b> <b>tax</b> is levied. In comparison to the log <b>export</b> <b>tax</b> recommended by Dumont and Wright (2006), the optimal tax for a small economy is always lower, while it is lower only in certain circumstances for an economy with market power. These results suggest that the Dumont and Wright policy is not efficient. softwood lumber trade, lumber and log interaction, log <b>export</b> <b>tax...</b>|$|R

30|$|In {{the long}} term, we should restore the <b>export</b> <b>tax</b> to zero. The {{frequently}} adjusted <b>export</b> <b>tax</b> rebate {{is closely related}} to our exchange rate policy, to the insufficiently reformed pricing mechanisms for resources and energy, and also to the high ratio of indirect tax revenues to total tax revenues. The current export rebate policy is termed a policy, not a system. The frequently fluctuating <b>export</b> rebate <b>tax</b> rate is not beneficial to the export rate system for firms, making decision-making more risky for companies, and thus affecting the whole economy. Now, most of the nations in the world have implemented a zero <b>export</b> <b>tax</b> rate, and China should not be excused from joining this trend. A zero <b>export</b> <b>tax</b> rate can promote the competitiveness of Chinese products in the global market, stabilizing companies’ expectations and creating a healthy, predictable tax structure.|$|R
5|$|Rich traders contributed {{significantly}} to the king's treasury through paying import and <b>export</b> <b>taxes.</b> The edicts of the Aihole Svamis mention trade ties with foreign kingdoms such as Chera, Pandya, Maleya (Malaysia), Magadh, Kaushal, Saurashtra, Kurumba, Kambhoja (Cambodia), Lata (Gujarat), Parasa (Persia) and Nepal. Travelling both land and sea routes, these merchants traded mostly in precious stones, spices and perfumes, and other specialty items such as camphor. Business flourished in precious stones such as diamonds, lapis lazuli, onyx, topaz, carbuncles and emeralds. Commonly traded spices were cardamom, saffron, and cloves, while perfumes included the by-products of sandalwood, bdellium, musk, civet and rose. These items were sold either in bulk or hawked on streets by local merchants in towns. The Western Chalukyas controlled most of South India's west coast and by the 10th century they had established extensive trade ties with the Tang Empire of China, the empires of Southeast Asia and the Abbasid Caliphate in Bhagdad, and by the 12th century Chinese fleets were frequenting Indian ports. Exports to Song Dynasty China included textiles, spices, medicinal plants, jewels, ivory, rhino horn, ebony and camphor. The same products also reached ports in the west such as Dhofar and Aden. The final destinations for those trading with the west were Persia, Arabia and Egypt. The thriving trade center of Siraf, a port on the eastern coast of the Persian Gulf, served an international clientele of merchants including those from the Chalukya empire who were feasted by wealthy local merchants during business visits. An indicator of the Indian merchants' importance in Siraf comes from records describing dining plates reserved for them. In addition to this, Siraf received aloe wood, perfumes, sandalwood and condiments. The most expensive import to South India were Arabian horse shipments, this trade being monopolised by Arabs and local Brahmin merchants. Traveller Marco Polo, in the 13th century, recorded that the breeding of horses never succeeded in India due to differing climatic, soil and grassland conditions.|$|E

It employs a {{computable general equilibrium}} methodology based on a bi-regional social accounting matrix for Ethiopia. The simulation experiment quantifies system-wide impacts of <b>exports</b> <b>tax</b> on agricultural products. Protecting consumers (particularly urban households), transferring income from producers to consumers, and shifting resources from the agriculture to industry {{are among the most}} important motivations cited in the literature for <b>exports</b> <b>tax</b> on agricultural products in developing economies. However, taking inter-regional spill-over effects into account, this study shows that the removal of agricultural <b>export</b> <b>tax</b> does actually improve household welfare both in the rural and urban regions.

25|$|The Confederate {{government}} initially {{wanted to}} finance its war mostly through tariffs on imports, <b>export</b> <b>taxes,</b> and voluntary donations of gold. After the spontaneous imposition of an embargo on cotton sales to Europe in 1861, these sources of revenue dried {{up and the}} Confederacy increasingly turned to issuing debt and printing {{money to pay for}} war expenses. The Confederate States politicians were worried about angering the general population with hard taxes. A tax increase might disillusion many Southerners, so the Confederacy resorted to printing more money. As a result, inflation increased and remained a problem for the southern states {{throughout the rest of the}} war. By April 1863, for example, the cost of flour in Richmond had risen to $100 a barrel and housewives were rioting.|$|E
25|$|With {{the conquest}} of Italy, {{prepared}} viae were extended from Rome and its vicinity to outlying municipalities, sometimes overlying earlier roads. Building viae was a military responsibility and thus came {{under the jurisdiction of}} a consul. The process had a military name, viam munire, as though the via were a fortification. Municipalities, however, were responsible for their own roads, which the Romans called viae vicinales. The beauty and grandeur of the roads might tempt us to believe that any Roman citizen could use them for free, but this was not the case. Tolls abounded, especially at bridges. Often they were collected at the city gate. Freight costs were made heavier still by import and <b>export</b> <b>taxes.</b> These were only the charges for using the roads.

To see this, we plot the trends in average <b>export</b> <b>tax</b> {{for the four}} most important sectors in agriculture, Cereals and Oil Seeds, Dairy, and Meat in Fig. 10.

25|$|Until the {{liberalisation}} of 1991, India {{was largely}} and intentionally isolated from world markets, {{to protect its}} economy and to achieve self-reliance. Foreign trade was subject to import tariffs, <b>export</b> <b>taxes</b> and quantitative restrictions, while foreign direct investment (FDI) was restricted by upper-limit equity participation, restrictions on technology transfer, export obligations and government approvals; these approvals were needed for nearly 60% of new FDI in the industrial sector. The restrictions ensured that FDI averaged only around $200million annually between 1985 and 1991; {{a large percentage of}} the capital flows consisted of foreign aid, commercial borrowing and deposits of non-resident Indians. India's exports were stagnant for the first 15years after independence, due to general neglect of trade policy by the government of that period; imports in the same period, with early industrialisation, consisted predominantly of machinery, raw materials and consumer goods.|$|E
25|$|The {{constitutional}} monarchy {{was marked}} {{by a series of}} legislative proposals by the government of the day, which had its base in the idealism of Mouzinho da Silveira. During his terms in office Silveira promoted revolutionary legislation for both the absolutist and liberal governments of the time (1823–1833). Payment of rents to the State, relations between the people and the Church, and municipal governance remained {{as they were in the}} medieval era. Silveira realized, to the chagrin of other Portuguese politicians, that politics was an instrument dependent on socioeconomic conditions. Marginalized at first by both absolutists and liberals, his ideas and solutions were later adopted by the new generation of liberal politicians in the post-War era. Among his many proposals, successive governments adopted his policies of disengaging the economy from social conditions, limiting taxes to 5%, ending tithes, abolishing seigniorial fees, reducing <b>export</b> <b>taxes</b> to 1%, terminating the regulation of inter-community commerce and government intervention in municipal affairs, as well as separating the judiciary and administrative offices, liberating general commerce and prohibiting some monopolies (such as the sale of soap and of Porto wines). In general, his initiatives were legislated by the post-War regimes to eliminate the privileges of the elite classes, establish social equality, encourage liberalization of the economy and improve government performance.|$|E
