The trio undergo a long journey with many obstacles in their path including Death Eaters, Snatchers, the mysterious Deathly Hallows, and Harry's connection with the Dark Lord's mind becoming ever stronger.|$|E

25|$|Before {{the five}} {{required}} daily prayers, a muezzin calls the worshippers to prayer from the minaret. In many countries like Singapore where Muslims {{are not the}} majority, mosques are prohibited from loudly broadcasting the call to prayer (adhan), although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> said loudly to the surrounding community. The adhan is required before every prayer. However, nearly every mosque assigns a muezzin for each prayer to say the adhan {{as it is a}} recommended practice or sunnah of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. At mosques that do not have minarets, the adhan is called instead from inside the mosque or somewhere else on the ground. The iqama, which is similar to the adhan and said immediately before the start of prayer, is usually not said from the minaret even if a mosque has one.|$|E
25|$|Dungeon Keeper was {{announced}} in August 2013, although development began the previous year. It was scheduled for a winter release, and designed for touchscreens. According to senior producer Jeff Skalski, Mythic Entertainment had to make significant changes to Dungeon Keeper for mobile platforms, although there were aspects of the original games from Bullfrog Productions they wanted to keep, such as the humour. The intention was to give players an experience of the original Dungeon Keeper. Despite this, he stated {{that they were not}} trying to recreate the original games, or the cancelled Dungeon Keeper 3, but rather a mobile game for mobile systems. The colour palette was expanded to make the creatures easier to see on mobile phones. The role of traps was increased, and gameplay was made to focus as much on offence as defence. According to Skalski, the god-view facilitated the porting to touch-screen devices. The development team took into account feedback from fans on the internet, and their goal was to make the game free so many people could play it. Skalski emphasized that the game is built for typical mobile game patterns, which meant that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> played for brief periods multiple times per day. He disagreed with assertions that it lacks the humour of the original, due to Richard Ridings (who, according to him, is a fan-favourite) providing the voice-overs like he did with the original Dungeon Keeper and Dungeon Keeper 2, which included over 500 lines of dialogue.|$|E

500|$|Alpha Centauri set out {{to capture}} the whole sweep of humanity's future, {{including}} technology, futuristic warfare, social and economic development, {{the future of the}} human condition, spirituality, and philosophy. Reynolds also said that [...] "getting philosophy into the game" [...] was one of the attractions of the game. Believing good science fiction thrives on constraint, the developers began with near-future technologies. As they proceeded into the future, they tried to present a coherent, logical, and detailed picture of future developments in physics, biology, information technology, economics, society, government, and philosophy. Alien ecologies and mysterious intelligences were incorporated into Alpha Centauri as external [...] "natural forces" [...] intended to serve as flywheels for the backstory and a catalyst for many player intelligences. Chris Pine, creator of the in-game map of Planet, strove to make Planet look like a real planet, which resulted in evidence of tectonic action. Another concern was that Planet matched the story, which resulted in the fungus being connected across continents, as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a gigantic neural network.|$|E

In 1931, he was made {{a member of the}} Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin. As the Nazi party took power in Germany, it became impossible for Kirchner to sell his paintings. In 1933, he was forced to resign from the Prussian Academy of Arts. Kirchner became increasingly disturbed by the situation in Germany, writing: [...] "Here we have been hearing terrible rumours about torture of the Jews, but it’s all surely untrue. I’m a little tired and sad about the situation up there. There is a war in the air. In the museums, the hard-won cultural achievements of the last 20 years are being destroyed, and yet the reason why we founded the Brücke was to encourage truly German art, made in Germany. And now <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> un-German. Dear God. It does upset me".|$|E
2500|$|There are {{no actual}} [...] "rules" [...] {{for members of}} the royal family, because their arms are {{theoretically}} decided ad hoc by the monarch.

These will always be the [...] "arms of dominion" [...] of the monarch with a label argent for difference; the label may have three or five points.

[...] Though de facto in English heraldry the crest is uncharged (although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in theory), as it would accumulate more and more cadency marks with each generation, the marks eventually becoming indistinguishable, the crests of the royal family are always shown as charged.|$|E
