40|$|AbstractHigh {{efficient}} and precise slicing method {{is required for}} the slicing of silicon carbide ingot. The newly developed multi-wire electrical discharge slicing method would decrease the kerf width and the cracks generated on machined surface. However, much higher wire tension is required in order to reduce wire vibration and to perform a smaller kerf width. Thin wire electrode with round section does not have enough cross sectional area under the high wire tension condition. Therefore, a wire electrode with track- shaped section was proposed and applied to the wire EDM slicing of silicon carbide ingot. The running control of wire electrode with track-shaped section was experimentally investigated. The side support method with <b>fixture</b> <b>plates</b> could decrease the kerf width by brass coated steel wire electrode with track-shaped section. The parallel drawing type traverser and the short distance setting points of side support <b>fixture</b> <b>plates</b> could perform the smaller vibration of w ire electrode with track-shaped section and the decrease of kerf width...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{experimental results}} on the thermal performance of various nested canister configurations and canister holding fixtures {{to be used in}} the Los Alamos Nuclear Materials Storage Facility. The experiment consisted of placing a heated aluminum billet (to represent heat-generating nuclear material) inside curved- and flat-bottom canisters with and without holding plate fixtures and/or extended fin surfaces. Surface temperatures were measured at several locations on the aluminum billet, inner and outer canisters, and the holding plate fixture to assess the effectiveness of the various configurations in removing and distributing the heat from the aluminum billet. Results indicated that the curved-bottom canisters, with or without holding fixtures, were extremely ineffective in extracting heat from the aluminum billet. The larger thermal contact area provided by the flat-bottom canisters compared with the curved-bottom design, greatly enhanced the heat removal process and lowered the temperature of the aluminum billet considerably. The addition of the <b>fixture</b> <b>plates</b> to the flat-bottom canister geometry greatly enhances the heat removal rates and lowers the canister operating temperatures considerably. The addition of the <b>fixture</b> <b>plates</b> to the flat-bottom canister geometry greatly enhances the heat removal rates and lowers the canister operating temperatures considerably.

40|$|Abstract. A newly {{developed}} multi-wire {{electrical discharge machining}} (EDM) method would accomplish the high performance slicing of silicon and silicon carbide with a narrow kerf width under a clean process environment. However, the thinner wire is challenging process with a normal round shape wire electrode. Therefore, a new wire electrode with track-shaped section was proposed {{in order to satisfy}} both the narrow kerf width and the high wire tension even in the case of thin wire electrode. In this study, the running control of wire electrode with track-shaped section was experimentally investigated, and the possibility of proposed process was discussed. A brass coated steel wire electrode with track-shaped section of aspect ratio 1 : 2 could perform the smaller vibration and the stable running up to 300 m/min. The side support method with <b>fixture</b> <b>plates</b> could improve the running stability of brass coated steel wire electrode with track-shaped section and reduce the kerf width. The brass coated steel wire electrode with track-shaped section could accomplish the uniform and straight kerf shape by increasing the wire tension...|$|E

A major drawback is the poor chemical stability of metallic magnesium; it corrodes {{at a pace that}} is too high for most prospective implant applications. Requirements for biodegradable implants are bio-compatibility, controlled biodegradability and sustainable mechanical properties. Various magnesium alloys containing Al, Zn, Y and rare-earth elements are analyzed in this respect. The alloys are compared on the basis of microstructure, tensile tests and potentio-dynamic polarization tests in simulated body fluid. The effects of semi-solid processing, hot extrusion, heat treatments and sterilization on corrosion resistance and tensile properties are investigated.

40|$|Modular {{fixturing}} kits {{are precisely}} machined sets of components used for flexible, short-turnaround construction of fixtures {{for a variety}} of manufacturing purposes. A modular vise is a parallel-jaw vise, where each jaw is a modular <b>fixture</b> <b>plate</b> with a regular grid of precisely positioned holes. A modular vise can be used to locate and hold parts for machining, assembly, and inspection tasks. To fixture a part, one places pins in some of the holes so that when the vise is closed, the part is reliably located and completely constrained. The modular vise concept can be adapted easily to the design of modular parallel-jaw grippers for robots. By attaching a grid plate to each jaw of a parallel-jaw gripper, the authors gain the ability to easily construct high-quality grasps {{for a wide variety of}} parts from a standard set of hardware. Wallack and Canny developed a previous algorithm for planning planar grasp configurations for the modular vise. In this paper, the authors expand this work to produce a 3 -d fixture/gripper design tool. They describe several analyses added to the planar algorithm to improve its utility, including a three-dimensional grasp quality metric based on geometric and force information, three-dimensional geometric loading analysis, and inter-gripper interference analysis to determine the compatibility of multiple grasps for handing the part from one gripper to another. Finally, the authors describe two applications which combine the utility of modular vise-style grasping with inter-gripper interference: The first is the design of a flexible part-handling subsystem for a part cleaning workcell under development at Sandia National Laboratories; the second is the automatic design of grippers that support the assembly of multiple products on a single assembly line...|$|R
40|$|The Los Alamos National Laboratory's Nuclear Materials Storage Facility (NMSF) {{is being}} renovated for {{long-term}} storage of canisters {{designed to hold}} heat-generating nuclear materials. A fully passive cooling scheme, relying on the transfer of heat by conduction, free convection, and radiation has been proposed as a reliable means of maintaining material at acceptable storage temperatures. The storage concept involves placing radioactive materials, with a net heat-generation rate of 10 W to 20 W, inside a set of nested steel canisters. The canisters are, in placed in holding fixtures and positioned vertically within a steel storage pipe. Several hundred drywells are arranged in a linear array within a large bay and dissipate the waste heat to the surrounding air, thus creating a buoyancy driven airflow pattern that draws cool air into the storage facility and exhausts heated air through an outlet stack. In this study, an experimental apparatus was designed to investigate the thermal characteristics of simulated nuclear materials placed inside two nested steel canisters positioned vertically on an aluminum <b>fixture</b> <b>plate</b> and placed inside a section of steel pipe. The heat-generating nuclear materials were simulated with a solid aluminum cylinder containing. an embedded electrical resistance heater.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a novel self-aligning parallel <b>plate</b> <b>fixture</b> (SAPP) for rotational rheometers. The ring-shaped shearing surface of this fixture is held {{on a low}} friction single contact point bearing and uses hydrodynamic lubrication forces {{in order to maintain}} the parallelism of the freely tilting surfaces over a full rotation. The optimized parallelism of the plates enables to conduct tribological measurements of low frictional stress between the shearing surface materials and a fluid at normal loads down to 1. 3 kPa.

The dynamics of entangled polymeric solutions were studied using drag of borosilicate discs and conventional shear rheometry devices {{in order to understand the}} effect of deformation on the relaxation process and the possible influence of slower processes such as tube reorganization. In order to compare the results obtained from both types of deformations, the drag force was normalized with the expected Newtonian behavior and a normalized viscosity was obtained. In both geometries, the presence of different and well defined power law regimes was found. The slower rate regime is characterized with an exponent close to - 0. 5, which can be related to the influence of constraint release in the dynamics of highly entangled polymer systems. The influence of non-bulk effects, such as slip, was resolved by the surface modification of the dragged discs and aluminum cone and <b>plate</b> <b>fixtures,</b> which was obtained through the grafting of different molecular weight polymer chains.

St. Peter's congregation that the Mellon mansion, 6500 Fifth Avenue, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was to be demolished. Stanish had worked for the three Mellon brothers until the last of them died in 1938. The Mellon family had spent years entertaining important people, including royalty, celebrities, well known financiers, and statesmen in the Mellon Mansion. It was built using Michigan sandstone and was four stories high on one side and three stories high on the other. The mansion had sixty-five rooms, plus halls and vestibules. There were 11 bathrooms, one of which had cost over $10,000 to complete because the walls and floor were covered in Italian marble and the <b>fixtures</b> were <b>plated</b> in gold. At one time, a hundred servants had maintained the house and surrounding grounds. The mansion had been completed in 1909 and had cost Mr. Mellon approximately three million dollars. The inside was filled with marble from all over the world, including China, Japan, and India. There were bronze doors cast in England, hand painted ceilings, and steel beams manufactured by the Carnegie Steel Company. In addition, {{one of the most expensive}} organs in the world was housed in this building. The items which the mansion contained were being sold for less than their actual values. For example, a half a million dollars worth of furniture had been sold for $3,800. The building contained many items that could easily be used in a church. There were mantles that could become altars and pieces of architecture, such as angel statues, that could be placed in Mount St. Peter Church. In 1940, St. Peter's congregation bought all of the stone, granite, marble, bronze doors, and railings from the mansion. In addition, the congregation purchased thirty tons of steel beams, sixty-five oak doors, chandeliers, and some other items, and the members transported all of the marble [...] from Pittsburgh to New Kensington. The location of the mansion is now home to Mellon Park.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the dynamic response of industrial rubbers (styrene-butadiene random copolymers, SBR) in torsion and compare against common small amplitude oscillatory shear measurements {{by using a}} torsion rectangular fixture, a modified torsion cylindrical fixture, and a conventional parallel <b>plate</b> <b>fixture,</b> respectively, in two different rheometers (ARES 2 kFRTN 1 from TA Instruments, USA and MCR 702 from Anton Paar-Physica, Austria). The effects of specimen geometry (length-to-width aspect ratio) on storage modulus and level of clamping are investigated. For cylindrical specimens undergoing torsional deformation, we find that geometry and clamping barely affect the shear moduli, and the measurements essentially coincide with those using parallel plates. In contrast, a clear dependence of the storage modulus on the aspect ratio is detected for specimens having rectangular cross section. The empirical correction used routinely in this test is based on geometrical factors and can account for clamping effects, but works only for aspect ratios above a threshold value of 1. 4. By employing a finite element analysis, we perform a parametric study {{of the effects of}} the aspect ratio in the cross-sectional stress distribution and the linear viscoelastic torsional response. We propose a new, improved empirical equation for obtaining accurate moduli values in torsion at different aspect ratios, whose general validity is demonstrated in both rheometers. These results should provide a guideline for measurements with different elastomers, for which comparison with dynamic oscillatory tests may not be possible due to wall slip issues...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} a {{detailed}} rheological investigation of well-defined symmetric entangled polymer stars of low functionality with varying number of arms, molar mass of the arms, and solvent content. Emphasis {{is placed on the}} response of the stars in simple shear, during start-up, and for relaxation upon flow cessation. To reduce experimental artifacts associated with edge fracture (primarily) and wall slip, we employ a homemade cone-partitioned <b>plate</b> <b>fixture</b> which was successfully implemented in recent studies. Reliable data for these highly entangled stars could be obtained for Weissenberg numbers below 300. The appearance of a stress overshoot during start-up with a corresponding strain approaching a value of 2 suggests that in the investigated shear regime the stars orient but do not stretch. This is corroborated {{by the fact that the}} empirical Cox-Merx rule appears to be validated, within experimental error. On the other hand, the (shear) rate dependent steady shear viscosity data exhibit a slope smaller than the convective constraint release slope of - 1 (for linear polymers) for the investigated range of rates. The broadness of the stress overshoot reflects the broad linear relaxation spectrum of the stars. The initial stress relaxation rate, reflecting the initial loss of entanglements due to the action of convective constraint release in steady shear flow, increases with Weissenberg number. More importantly, when compared against the relevant rates for comb polymers with relatively short arms, the latter are slower at larger Weissenberg numbers. At long times, the relaxation data are consistent with the linear viscoelastic data on these systems. © 2013 American Chemical Society...|$|R

Prepreg tack {{is one of several}} critical parameters affecting composite manufacturing by automated fiber placement (AFP). Tack plays {{a central role in the}} prevention of wrinkles and puckers that can occur during AFP, thus knowledge of tack variation arising from a myriad of manufacturing and environmental conditions is imperative for the prediction of defects during AFP. A full design of experiments was performed to experimentally characterize tack on 0. 25 -inch slit-tape tow IM 7 / 8552 - 1 prepreg using probe tack testing. Several process parameters (contact force, contact time, retraction speed, and probe diameter) as well as environmental parameters (temperature and humidity) were varied such that the entire parameter space could be efficiently evaluated. Mid-point experimental conditions (i. e., parameters not at either extrema) were included to enable prediction of curvature in relationships and repeat measurements were performed to characterize experimental error. Collectively, these experiments enable determination of primary dependencies as well as multi-parameter relationships. Slit-tape tow samples were mounted to the bottom plate of a rheometer parallel <b>plate</b> <b>fixture</b> using a jig to prevent modification of the active area to be interrogated with the top plate, a polished stainless steel probe, during tack testing. The probe surface was slowly brought into contact with the pre-preg surface until a pre-determined normal force was achieved (2 - 30 newtons). After a specified dwell time (0. 02 - 10 seconds), during which the probe substrate interaction was maintained under displacement control, the probe was retracted from the surface (0. 1 - 50 millimeters per second). Initial results indicated a clear dependence of tack strength on several parameters, with a particularly strong dependence on temperature and humidity. Although an increase in either of these parameters reduces tack strength, a maximum in tack was predicted to occur under conditions of low temperature and moderate humidity...|$|R
