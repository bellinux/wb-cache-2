5|$|Each year, {{thousands}} of outdoor enthusiasts attempt to summit Mount Adams. The false summits and broad summit plateau have disheartened many climbers as this inscription {{on a rock}} at Piker’s Peak indicates. “You are a piker <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> this is the summit. Don’t crab, the mountain was here first.” Crampons and ice axes are needed on many routes because of glaciers and the route’s steepness. Aside from crevasses on the more difficult glacier routes, the biggest hazard is the loose rocks and boulders which are easily dislodged and a severe hazard for climbers below. These falling rocks are especially dangerous for climbers on the precipitous east faces and the steep headwalls of {{the north and west}} sides. Routes in those areas should only be climbed early in the season under as ideal conditions as can be had. Other hazards faced by climbers on Adams include sudden storms and clouds, avalanches, altitude sickness, and inexperience. Climbing Mount Adams can be dangerous {{for a variety of reasons}} and people have died in pursuit of the summit while many others have had close calls.|$|E

500|$|In 1998, the MTV {{animated}} show Celebrity Deathmatch had a clay-animated {{fight to}} the death between Jagger and Aerosmith lead singer Steven Tyler. Jagger wins the fight by using his tongue to stab Tyler through the chest. The 2000 film Almost Famous, set in 1973, refers to Jagger: [...] "Because <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> Mick Jagger'll still be out there, trying to be a rock star at age 50 ... you're sadly, sadly mistaken." ...|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producer}} Frank Spotnitz {{was inspired}} to write the episode after watching the 1972 American thriller film Deliverance. Spotnitz recounted, [...] "the idea of being stranded in a hostile environment is very interesting to me {{and so is the}} idea of something moving the brush that you can't see." [...] Series writer Vince Gilligan contributed to the [...] "team builder" [...] exercise bit. The ending was left intentionally ambiguous.

During the Los Angeles protests, a plane flew overhead trailing a large sign that read [...] "Honk <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> Scientology is a cult."

It also contains a featurette, [...] "Fool <b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>Think</b> It's Over", with retrospective interviews. The second series {{was released on}} 17 March 2008 as a two-disc set. It contains audio commentaries on all episodes: five featuring a mix of Moffat, Bathurst, Gillies, Bennett, Raffield and Ptaszynski, with episode two featuring Spiers, and production manager Stacey Adair that concentrates on the behind-the-scenes production. The pilot from Comic Asides is also included on Disc 2, along with {{a complete set of}} Series Two scripts in Portable Document Format (PDF) and a PDF article entitled [...] "Joking Apart In The Studio".

The {{original}} Rea version {{was used for the}} pilot's closing credits, but for the series it was performed by Kenny Craddock, who arranged the incidental music with Colin Gibson. Beginning with a saxophone, only the chorus of the theme song accompanied the opening titles. These ran over legal imagery and a sequence of images of famous separated couples, including Arthur Miller and Marilyn Monroe; Winnie and Nelson Mandela; The Princess Anne and Mark Phillips, and culminating in Mark and Becky. The closing credits featured a verse and chorus. The first part of the closing credits was usually over a still of the final frame, and faded to black with the line [...] "All dressed in black." ...|$|E

500|$|Andrew Garfield {{believes}} {{the story of}} Never Let Me Go is about humans, and exploring [...] "what {{it is to have}} a soul, and how you prove what a soul is"; he says he enjoys the way the film is a [...] "call to arms" [...] about the positives of life. He adds that its message could hopefully remind people that they have a choice when they arise in the morning whether to pursue their own choice of activities for the day, or to do what they should do or are obliged to do. Keira Knightley feels that the film's story is alarming, but has said that the film is [...] "more about humanity's ability to look the other way". [...] "You know in fact that if your morals can go out the window <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> you can survive in a certain way, whatever your morals may be".|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to {{his role in the}} television series, Dale's comic book counterpart is among the longest surviving characters in the series, and he enters into a sexual relationship with Andrea. Kirkman asserted that it was necessary for writers to distance the development of Dale's television character from that in the comic: [...] "I have talked many times how much I like the difference between the comics and the show. There are going to be big plot lines that we may not necessarily get to, like the romance between Dale and Andrea. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> you really want to read that story line, that's available in the comics, and I highly recommend you pick those up. The show {{is always going to be}} a different animal and the decision to kill Dale off was a big one and it wasn't one that was made lightly." ...|$|E

Richard Schickel of Time magazine disregarded the request and revealed Rusty's innocence in his review. He wrote, [...] "Carolyn's murderer has an excellent motive both for killing her... But {{it is hard to}} accept the possibility that the real perpetrator would leave his escape from the trap entirely to chance." [...] Jay Boyar of the Orlando Sentinel surmised, [...] "It's not that Warner Bros. is actually concerned that reviewers will tip the solution to the murder mystery. It's that the studio wants to further the impression that the movie is full of surprises." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times stated, [...] "Even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> you know what the solution is, the performances are so clever and the screenplay... is so subtle that it could well turn out that your expectations are wrong." ...|$|E

500|$|Although Speed {{would play}} several gigs at the Green Man pub in Plumstead, the band {{did not last}} long, but it {{encouraged}} Dickinson {{to continue to work}} towards being a musician. Dickinson spotted an advertisement in Melody Maker with the caption [...] "Singer wanted for recording project" [...] and replied immediately. He recorded a demo tape and sent it with a note which read: [...] "By the way, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> the singing's crap, there's some John Cleese stuff recorded on the other side you might find amusing." [...] They liked what they heard and invited Dickinson down to the studio to make [...] "Dracula", the first song he would ever record, with a band called [...] "Shots", formed by two brothers, Phil and Doug Siviter. The song would later appear on the second disc of The Best of Bruce Dickinson compilation. [...] The brothers were impressed with Dickinson's vocal abilities and asked him to join their group.|$|E

[...] He said: [...] "Crime and violence follow African-Americans wherever they go, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that is racist, then spend some time on the mean streets of south Memphis."
