50|$|For much of {{the time}} Kendall was being treated for cancer, the magazine's deputy, Graham Clarke, had been acting editor, and upon Kendall's death he was {{appointed}} editor. Clarke had been born into horticulture as his father had been a Superintendent (today known as a Manager) of Regent's Park in the centre of London. For all of Clarke's childhood he had lived in a lodge within the Queen Mary Rose Garden. When a teenager, he and his family moved to Hyde Park, London's most famous open space. After completing school he studied horticulture at the Royal Horticultural Society's Wisley Garden in Surrey. Theory and practical qualifications lead him to a year working in the garden at Buckingham Palace, following by a stint working in the commercial <b>glasshouse</b> <b>nursery</b> for the Central Royal Parks. In 1976 he moved into journalism, joining Amateur Gardening as a trainee sub-editor. He rose through the ranks, and took over as editor in 1986.|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} between plants and their herbivores has {{played an important}} role in driving the form of many plant traits, including defensive chemistry and plant recovery following loss of biomass. Identifying intraspecific variation in such traits is not only crucial for our ecological and evolutionary understanding of plant-herbivore associations, but also for how they can shape the structure of natural ecosystems. In a series of <b>glasshouse,</b> <b>nursery</b> and field trials I explored plant-mammal associations by investigating intraspecific variation in foliar chemical defence and plant recovery after damage (including physiological and morphological traits) in early life stage Eucalyptus globulus. The key research questions were 1). Is there ontogenetic variation in foliar terpenes during early stage development of E. globulus seedlings, and does this vary at the population and family level? 2). Is there intraspecific genetic variation in photosynthetic rate, chlorophyll content, defensive chemistry and growth response to partial artificial browsing of juvenile E. globulus. 3). Is there intraspecific genetic variation in E. globulus seedling survival and growth from lignotubers after severe artificial browsing. 4). What is the pattern (spatial and genetic) and direct impact of natural mammalian browsing on E. globulus seedlings in the field, and subsequent indirect effects on a dependent foliar organism. A comparison of different populations of E. globulus showed significant genetic and ontogenetic variation in foliar terpenes throughout seedling development with a series of both dynamic and stable responses. Ontogenetic trajectories differed among populations suggesting that evolution may exploit the ontogenetic patterns of change in these compounds to create a diverse chemical mosaic with which to defend the plant. A key finding was the different behaviour of the two major terpene groups, which reflects their biosynthetic origins. Sesquiterpenes changed more rapidly throughout early ontogeny compared to monoterpenes, with sesquiterpenes expressing opposite trajectories between compounds. Despite the large constitutive differences that exist in foliar chemistry and storage allocation between E. globulus populations, defoliation elicited conservative recovery responses in physiological, growth and foliar chemical traits. Populations subject to a partial defoliation treatment (50...|$|E
2500|$|The school leases {{approximately}} ten {{hectares of}} {{land from the}} neighbouring electricity sub-station for use in practical agriculture lessons. The farm land is situated north of the general school buildings, extending north to Lynch Close and east to Jenkins Road. The farm is arranged to include a vegetable garden, a classroom, a <b>glasshouse</b> and <b>nursery,</b> a greenhouse, an orchard, experimental plots, an area for field crops and a livestock section, among others. [...] It also contains some riparian land which is currently being monitored and undergoing rehabilitation to its native state by the Streamwatch group (currently working as part of Sydney Water Streamwatch).|$|R
50|$|Merrybent is {{a linear}} {{village in the}} civil parish of Low Coniscliffe and Merrybent in County Durham, in England. It is {{situated}} on the A67 road {{to the west of}} Darlington, a short distance {{to the north of the}} River Tees and the Teesdale Way. At the beginning of the 20th century there were hardly any buildings here, and its main feature at that time was Merrybent Nurseries with its many <b>glasshouses.</b> The <b>nursery</b> was cut through by the A1 road in the 1960s; at this point it runs on the trackbed of the old Merrybent railway. The village is now a settlement of modern housing.|$|R
40|$|Experiment was {{conducted}} at Imam Malik Plant Nursery Unit of Maiduguri, Borno State. During the period of June 2008 -December 2009, to investigate the use of whip-grafting technique for mango propagation, evaluation and performance of Mango propagated were determined using the Scion which is detached from the parent tree. The treatments were rootstock diameters of 1. 5, 1. 5 to 0. 5 cm; Scion hardening methods in which the leaves were either removed or trimmed to half leaves, scion length of 8 - 9 or 15 - 16 cm, <b>glasshouse</b> and <b>nursery</b> shed conditions and two cultivars, namely Bokorram and Man lawan. The most viable scions with {{the highest number of}} successful graft were obtained when scions in which all the leaves were removed, were grafted on rootstock 0. 5 diameter. There {{was no significant difference between}} two mango cultivars, but Manlawan tended to have higher values...|$|R
40|$|Casuarina {{trees are}} planted along the coastal {{area of the}} South China as windbreaks, and in {{agroforestry}} systems and for wood and fuel wood production. At present, casuarina plantations cover about 300, 000 hectares. Casuarina equisetifolia, C. cunninghamiana, C. glauca and C. junghuhniana are the most commonly planted species. A simple technique for the mass propagation of casuarina seedlings has been developed using cuttings rooted in water. A series of field trials have been carried with various Casuarina species, provenances and clones to screen for adaptability to biotic and abiotic stresses in different areas of China. Experiments conducted in the <b>nursery,</b> <b>glasshouse</b> and field showed that ectomycorrhizal (ECTM), arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi or Frankia symbiotic associations {{play an important role}} in improved growth of managed casuarina plantations...|$|R
40|$|Growing of {{resistant}} cultivars is {{the most}} effective and ecological way to prevent losses due to the loose smut, a disease prevalent in farming without seed treatments. In the present poster, the resistance level to loose smut in some of the European oat cultivars and genebank accessions is described. For the inoculation of seed a vacuum-based method was used. The inoculum consisted of two loose-smut collections with different virulences. In all resistance screenings, inoculation was done at 800 mbar vacuum pressure and with an aqueous spore suspension of 1 g/litre. Resistance evaluations were started with a glasshouse experiment with 216 genebank A. sativa accessions and 40 oat breeding lines or differentials, followed by the nursery experiment at two locations examining 100 cultivars and lines, respectively, and were completed with a glasshouse experiment with 60 oat lines. The resistance screening at two locations and the two glasshouse screenings revealed at least 8 modern cultivars and 11 genebank accessions with very high levels of resistance. A highly significant correlation coefficient between <b>glasshouse</b> and <b>nursery</b> examination was found, whereby the glasshouse conditions were favourable for testing under a high disease pressure. Among the entries suitable for growing under ecological conditions, the smut-resistant cvs. 'Neklan', 'Jumbo', 'Firth', 'Hamel', 'Boxer', 'Auteuil' and 'Chantilly' are recommended. vokMyynti MTT tietopalvelu...|$|R
50|$|The A1, built 1963-1965, now {{follows the}} old rail {{trackbed}} {{as far as}} Barton quarries. The A1 was first proposed in 1929 but postponed due to the 1930s recession and World War II. After the Merrybent railway was abandoned, the road plan {{was associated with the}} Darlington bypass as a motorway in 1949, and was moved eastwards onto the old trackway in 1950. After various planning adjustments, construction of this stretch of the A1 started officially by Dowsett Engineering Ltd. of Gateshead on 6 May 1963. Peak production occurred in 1964, involving up to 800 men, and the road was opened on 14 May 1965 at a final cost of Â£6.5 million. Because the road followed the rail trackway, the only property affected on this part of the A1, apart from the station house at Barton, was the <b>glasshouses</b> at Merrybent <b>Nurseries.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{mycorrhiza}} helper bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens BBc 6, {{isolated from}} a Laccaria bicolor sporocarp, consistently promotes L. bicolor-Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) ectomycorrhizal formation, even with low doses of bacterial inoculum. In order {{to describe this}} phenomenon more accurately, we {{have looked at the}} location and survival of the introduced bacterial strain in the soil and in the rhizosphere during the establishment of mycorrhizal symbiosis in <b>glasshouse</b> and <b>nursery</b> experiments. Bacterial populations were quantified with a spontaneous, stable, rifampin-resistant mutant, BBc 6 R 8, which phenotypically conformed to the parental strain. BBc 6 R 8 populations declined rapidly, reaching the detection limit after 19 weeks, and did not increase either when L. bicolor sporocarps were forming in autumn or when Douglas fir roots resumed growing in spring. BBc 6 R 8 was neither an endophyte nor a rhizobacterium. Furthermore, it was not particularly associated with either mycorrhizas of Douglas fir-L. bicolor or L. bicolor sporocarps. Surprisingly, a significant mycorrhiza helper effect was observed when the inoculated BBc 6 R 8 population had dropped as low as 30 CFU g of dry matter(sup- 1) in the soil. This study raises questions concerning the bacterial concentration in the soil which is effective for promotion of mycorrhizal establishment and the timing of the bacterial effect. It allows us to develop working hypotheses, which can be tested experimentally, to identify the mechanisms of the mycorrhiza helper effect...|$|R
