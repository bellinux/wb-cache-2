40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{research}} was to evaluate the physical and mechanical properties of LVL reinforced with GFRP with two types of resines. At first, LVL panels were manufactured with nine layers of wood veneer glued with phenol-formaldehyde resin. After, they were reinforced with fiberglass impregnated with epoxy or isophthalic resin or with isophthalic resin. The treatments consisted on the aplication of one, two and four reinforced layers. The properties tested were density, moisture content, static bending in flatwise and edgewise position, modulus of elasticity (MOE) and modulus of rupture (MOR), glue line shear strength by compression loading. The epoxy and the isophthalic resin showed the same mechanical qualities among different treatments. MOE panel in flatwise position was influenced by one reinforcement layer and MOR was influenced by two reinforcement layers. In the edgewise position, MOE and MOR values remained stable among the treatments with two fiberglass reinforcement layers. The epoxy resin presented <b>higher</b> <b>glue</b> line resistance and higher percentage of wood failure. Isophthalic and phenolic resin presented similar values of glue line strength. However, the isophthalic resin had lower percentage of wood failure. Thus, the reinforcement with one layer of fiberglass with epoxy resin on the tensile side {{would be enough to}} boost the mechanical qualities of LVL...|$|E

While biofilm stability appeared to be related to total cell counts in nascent biofilm stages, the development of the bacterial community composition turned out to be even more crucial.

This emphasizes the importance of the molecular biology tools used in this study to address biofilm composition and diversity.

30|$|Although many {{conventional}} adhesives for plywood are formulated with tannins (polyflavanoid compounds) {{extracted from}} bark or wood, adhesives using tannin directly without extraction from the bark {{have also been}} made. In 2003, the first bark particle (<[*] 63  μm) adhesive was developed from radiata pine bark. In this present study, {{the quality of the}} bark adhesive has been improved by fibrillating the bark. Finely ground bark was fibrillated using a disc mill and formulated into plywood adhesives, which consisted of fibrillated bark, phenol–formaldehyde (PF) resin and water in different ratios. The gluability of the fibrillated bark adhesives was evaluated according to the Japanese Agricultural Standard for Plywood (JAS) and was found to be excellent. These bark adhesives have a number of advantages in that there is no tannin extraction, there is a total use of the bark, a low-level requirement of PF resins, no other components required and there is a <b>high</b> <b>glue</b> bond quality. Considering that very small amounts of fibrillated bark adhesives produced high-quality wood bonding, the bark components such as tannin, hemicellulose, lignin, cellulose nanofibers and other components may well be contributing to produce such a good bonding.|$|R

Shear strength increased as press time, press pres-sure, and/or press temperature increased. The effect of tempera-ture on shear strength became more significant at high press pressure. The shear strength of the SPI adhesive on fiber card-board decreased by 12 – 25 % after water soaking. Shear strength increased as pre-pressing drying time increased and reached its maximal value at about 10 min. An SPI/water ratio of 12 : 100 (w/w) gave the <b>highest</b> <b>gluing</b> strength.

On the other hand the predicted width of the ^ 3 F_ 4 state, although broader than the observed width, is consistent within the uncertainties of the model. This interpretation predicts large partial widths to K K^*(892) and K^*(892) K^*(892) final states which should be looked for. A second possibility that would account for the different properties of the ξ(2220) seen in different experiments is that two hadronic states exist at this mass.

40|$|Within a {{nonlinear}} chiral Lagrangian framework, {{the underlying}} mixings among quark-antiquark, four-quark and glue components of f_ 0 (1500) and f_ 0 (1710) are studied {{in a global}} picture that includes all isosinglet scalar mesons below 2 GeV. The quark components are introduced in the Lagrangian in terms of two separate nonets (a quark-antiquark nonet and a four-quark nonet) which can mix {{with each other and}} with a scalar glueball. The free parameters of the Lagrangian are studied by a simultaneous fit to more than 20 experimental data and constraints on the mass spectrum, decay widths, and decay ratios of the isosinglet scalars below 2 GeV. Moreover, constraints on the mass spectrum and decay widths of isodoublet and isovector scalars below 2 GeV as well as pion-pion scattering amplitude are also taken into account. The insights gained in this global picture, due to the complexities of the mixings as well as the experimental uncertainties, are mainly qualitative but are relatively robust, and reveal that the lowest scalar glueball hides between f_ 0 (1500) and f_ 0 (1710), resulting in a considerable mixing with various quark components of these two states. The overall current experimental and theoretical uncertainties do not allow to pin down the exact glue components of isosinglet states, nevertheless it is shown that the f_ 0 (1500) and f_ 0 (1710) have the <b>highest</b> <b>glue</b> component.

40|$|Issue: Historically, label {{adhesives}} used by bottlers {{were designed}} for easy removal so that bottlers could recover their own bottles through local buy-back programs and wash the containers for re-use. With most bottle-washing programs discontinued, {{and in response to}} marketing and operational considerations, many have converted to more convenient and durable label adhesives. These adhesives, which include press-applied and plastic labels, pose a major barrier to successful bottle washing because they do not readily come off in the caustic baths used in bottle washing machines. Best Practice: Several strategies may help to mitigate the problems associated with more durable label adhesives. The best way is to convince bottlers to use washing-friendly labels. This should be part of an overall marketing plan for the bottle-washing program (see Elements of a Bottle-Washing Program Best Practice).

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of transarterial embolization of arteriove-nous fistula (AVF) using liquid embolic agent can be maximized when the embolic material penetrates the AVF shunt into the adjacent draining vein. A major problem of embolization {{is how to}} precisely deliver the embolic material to the sites of the AVF. When selective positioning of the microcatheter into the AVF shunt is difficult, embolization can result in proximal feeder occlusion without reaching the shunt. When the shunt flow is too rapid to be safely occluded, embolic material can be over-penetrated into the vein, thus resulting in serious disturbance of venous drainage [1 - 3]. Flow control has been achieved by rapid injection of <b>high</b> concentration <b>glue,</b> by induction of stagnant flow with temporary balloon occlusion of the feeder or by using transvenous approach [4, 5]. But sometimes, selective catheterization of the microcatheter close to the AVF site is difficult to achieve in an AVF with a relatively small and tortuous feeding artery [6]. By using the so-called wedged-catheter position, low-concentration glue {{can be used to}} improve glue propagation along the feeding artery [7 - 12].

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{evolutionary}} {{origin of}} modern viscid silk orb webs from ancient cribellate silk ancestors {{is associated with}} a 95 % increase in diversity of orb-weaving spiders, and their dominance as predators of flying insects, yet the transition’s mechanistic basis is an evolutionary puzzle. Ancient cribellate silk is a dry adhesive that functions through van der Waals interactions. Viscid threads adhere more effectively than cribellate threads because of the high extensibility of their axial silk fibers, recruitment of multiple glue droplets, and firm adhesion of the viscid glue droplets. Viscid silk’s extensibility is permitted by the <b>glue’s</b> <b>high</b> water content, so that organic and inorganic salts present in viscid glue droplets play an essential role in contributing to adhesion by sequestering the atmospheric water that plasticizes the axial silk fibers. Here, we provide direct molecular and macro-scale evidence to show that salts also cause adhesion by directly solvating the glycoproteins, regardless of water content, thus imparting viscoelasticity and allowing the glue droplets to establish good contact. This “dual role ” of salts, plasticizing the axial silk indirectly through water sequestration and directly solvating the glycoproteins, provides a crucial link to the evolutionary transition from cribellate silk t...|$|R
