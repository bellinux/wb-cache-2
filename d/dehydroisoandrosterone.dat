40|$|The 17 -ketosteroids {{appearing}} in largest quan-tity {{in the urine}} of human subjects are dehydro-isoandrosterone, androsterone, and etiocholano-lone. 1 These steroids are not excreted to any ap-preciable extent in unconjugated form, but are conjugated as sulfates and glucuronides (1, 2). <b>Dehydroisoandrosterone</b> is excreted mainly as its sulfate congener, whereas androsterone and etio-cholanolone appear in the urine mainly as glucuro-nides. Nevertheless, the latter two compounds are also excreted as sulfates, and the concentration of these sulfates in urine may equal or exceed that of <b>dehydroisoandrosterone</b> sulfate (1, 2). It has been established that <b>dehydroisoandrosterone</b> sul-fate (D-S) is the main 17 -ketosteroid in human peripheral plasma (3 - 5). Androsterone sulfate (A-S) has been identified in smaller quantity in plasma (4 - 6), and etiocholanolone sulfate (E-S) {{is present in the}} smallest concentration of the three conjugates (7). Since the urinary concentration of these steroid sulfates {{does not appear to be}} a simple reflection of their usual plasma levels and there is present evidence that A-S is cleared by the kidney at a more rapid rate than D-S (8), it became pertinent to study the excretion of these compounds by the kidney. The glomerular fil-trate presented to the kidney tubules may be ideally considered as a protein-free ultrafiltrate of plasma containing only that fraction of the con-jugates not bound to plasma proteins.

40|$|The {{ingestion}} of <b>dehydroisoandrosterone</b> (DHA), a naturally occurring steroid, inhibits {{the development of}} autoimmunity, neoplasias, and other disorders of rodents. Potential mechanisms of action include (1) the induction of peroxisomal proliferation and (2) the conversion of DHA to androgens. We evaluated the immune system of mice fed DHA. Dietary DHA had no significant effect on antibody responses, cutaneous sensitivity reactions, natural killer activity, or graft-versus-host reactions. However, a decrease in lymphoid organ cellularity and an absence of splenic germinal centers were observed. We assessed progenitor cell activity in irradiated mice by evaluating the repopulation of marrow and lymphoid organs. <b>Dehydroisoandrosterone</b> feeding resulted in an inhibition of lymphopoiesis but not myelopoiesis. Clofibrate, another peroxisomal proliferator, failed to inhibit lymphocyte repopulation after irradiation.

40|$|The {{determination}} of urinary 17 -ketosteroids has limited {{applications in the}} understanding and diagnosis {{of the nature of}} endocrine disorders as-sociated with mild hirsutism and virilism in the female, because {{a very large number of}} these pa-tients excretes 17 -ketosteroids well within the nor-mal range.

40|$|It was {{demonstrated}} in a preceding study from these laboratories {{that patients with}} the genetic liver disease acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) 1 display a significant defect in the reductive transformation of prototy~) e steroid hormones such as testosterone and <b>dehydroisoandrosterone</b> (1). This defect is manifest by the marked preferential metabolism of these hormones along the 5 ~-pathway [...] the pathway through which endogenous steroids having a potent ability to induce the mitochondrial enzyme &aminolevulinate synthetase (ALAS) are generated (1 - 3). ALAS controls the rate-limiting step in porphyrin-heme synthesis (4) and has been found at high levels of activity in the livers of AIP patients (5). This excessive activity of hepatic ALAS accounts for the overproduction of porphyrin precursors which characterizes this genetic disorder (6 - 8). Reduction of the double bond at the A: B ring junction of neutral steroid hormones is catalyzed in the liver by two classes of enzymes: steroid A 4 - 5 a-reductases localized in the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and steroid A 4 - 5 fl-reductases found in the cytosol. The preferential metabolism of testosterone and <b>dehydroisoandrosterone</b> along the 5 fl-pathway in AIP could therefore {{be due to a}} decrease in the activity of the 5 c~-reductase for these hormones, an increase in the activity of the 5 flreductase, or both.

40|$|AbstractThe {{electron}} spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) technique of pulsed EPR spectroscopy {{was applied to}} the anionic semiquinone of the cholesterol oxidase flavin cofactor, formed when the enzyme was photoreduced in the presence of 5 -deazariboflavin and EDTA.

The optimalization of the bioconversion efficiency has been studied in culture media or in buffered solutions using free and immobilized cells. Microbiological (cell weight, choice of strains and substrate, induction) and physicochemical (pH, temperature, ionic strength and choice of buffers, organic solvents, artificial cofactors) factors influencing the reaction yield are discussed.

40|$|Sulfuric acid {{fluorescence}} {{of various}} steroid hormones was studied at room tem-perature. The intensity of this fluorescence of ^S-ketosteroids such as corticosteroids, progesterone and its derivatives, and androstene compounds, was increased by the intro-duction of the hydroxyl groups at O i l, O 17, O 21, {{but it was}} reduced by the intro-duction of a ketone at O i l, a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, a hydroxyl group at C- 16, and a reduction of double bond between carbons 4 and 5.

This mitochondrial enzyme is found {{at high levels}} of activity in the livers of patients with the genetic disease, acute intermittent porphyria (AIP). In this study the metabolism of 14 C-labeled testosterone was examined in AIP patients {{to determine whether there}} was a disproportionate conversion of the hormone to its 5 β, compared to its 5 α metabolite. The results indicate that AIP subjects do generate a substantially greater than normal fraction of 5 β metabolite from this steroid; the excessive degree of ring A reduction of testosterone taking place via the 5 β pathway in the porphyric patients averages 350 % greater than in the nonporphyric subjects. In one asymptomatic AIP patient the disproportionate generation of 5 β metabolite from the hormone reached a level 10 times the normal mean. Studies with a second 14 C-labeled hormone, <b>dehydroisoandrosterone,</b> whose metabolism in man resembles that of testosterone, confirmed the derangement in reductive transformation of steroids found in the individuals carrying the genetic lesion of AIP.

In normal women 80. 5 ± 1. 9 % (SEM) of the recovered radioactivity migrates with the β-globulins, 7. 3 ± 0. 80 % with the inter-α-globulins, and 4. 3 ± 0. 40 % with albumin. In normal men the percentages are 69. 3 ± 3. 0 %, 14. 3 ± 1. 6 %, and 6. 2 ± 1. 1 %, respectively. These {{differences between men and}} women in binding among the β-globulins and inter-α-globulins are statistically significant (P < 0. 001). The highest percentages of radioactivity associated with the β-globulins are seen in infants of both sexes, men receiving diethylstillbestrol, and pregnant women. These same subjects have the lowest percentages of radioactivity associated with the inter-α-globulins. Experiments with carrier testosterone indicate that at least some of the differences between the normal men and women and infants can be explained by differences in the concentration of endogenous testosterone.

The data were {{submitted to a}} detailed quantitative analysis including the estimation of the circadian rhythm and of the episodic variations {{as well as the}} evaluation of the concomitance of episodic pulses of different hormones. A bimodal circadian rhythm was detected in the various individual profiles. The major acrophase occurred in the morning earlier for T (around 04 : 00 h) than for the hormones of totally or partially adrenal origin (around 07 : 00 h); the secondary acrophase (around 17 : 00 h) and the main midnight nadir were common to all hormones. The amplitude of the rhythm was highest for purely adrenal hormones (F and 11 OHAD), averaging 79 and 75 %, respectively, lower for hormones of mixed origin (DHEA and AD), averaging 44 and 42 %, respectively, and minimal for T (22 %). The possible relationship between the circadian and pulsatile variations of the various steroids was estimated in each individual by calculating Pearson's standard coefficient of variation on all pairs of hormonal profiles. A very tight relationship (p > 0. 75; p 0. 30; p 0. 30; p < 0. 01). The pulsatility of the corticotrophic axis was readily transmitted to the secretory pattern of 11 OHAD, DHEA and AD. Ninety-six percent of the F pulses were reflected in at least one other hormonal profile. Finally, we showed that concomitant pulses common to the five adrenal and gonadal patterns were more frequent than would be expected on the basis of chance. These results (1) demonstrate a total parallelism between the long-lasting secretory events and the episodic bursts of the 4 adrenal hormones showing that the reticular and fascicular zones of the adrenal respond to pituitary control as an homogeneous structure; (2) demonstrate the existence of a partial synchronization of adrenal and testicular pulsatile variations; (3) suggest that, throughout the afternoon, a common mechanism may influence the slow variations of adrenal hormones and of testicular testosterone.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston University 2, 4 -Dinitrophenylhydrazone (DNPH) {{derivatives}} {{of twelve}} ketonic steroids were prepared and characterized. The steroids {{were chosen to}} include adrenal, placental and testicular hormanes and metabolites of these hormones. It was found {{with the exception of}} adrenosterone-bis-DNPH that the DNPH's could be classified into four well defined groups {{on the basis of their}} ultraviolet spectra and that this classification could be correlated with the structures of the DNPH's. Within each group the compounds were similar to each other with respect to their melting points, color, solubilities and infrared spectra as well as their ultraviolet absorption spectra. Group 1 a. - DNPH's of steroids having a single carbonyl group at the 17 or 20 position, having no double bond conjugated with the carbonyl group and having no adjacent hydroxyl groups. The steroids studied were pregnenolone, androsterone and <b>dehydroisoandrosterone.</b> These compounds were yellow, λmax. = 368 - 370 mµ, εmax = 24, 250 ± 550) and had melting points of 249 °- 255 ° ± 9 °C. Group 1 b. - DNPH's of monoketonic steroids having the Δ 4 - 3 -keto grouping as in testosterone and methyl testosterone. These compounds were red (λmax. = 392 - 394, εmax. = 31, 000) and had melting points in the range 216 - 238 °C. Group 2 a. - DNPH's of diketonic steroids, one of whose carbonyl was of the type 1 a. and the other of type 1 b. The steroids studied were Δ 4 -androstenedione, progesterone and 11 α-hydroxyprogesterone. These compounds were red-orange to red (λmax = 380 - 382, εmax. = 49, 300 ± 500) and decomposed before melting. Group 2 b. - DNPH's of diketonic steroids, as in group 2 a., but with a hydroxyl group adjacent to the C- 20 carbonyl. These compounds were red-orange (λmax. = 386, εmax. = 47, 500 ± 2, 600) and decomposed before melting. Evidence from the ultraviolet and infrared absorption spectra is presented suggesting that in this group the product isolated is one of a pair of geometrical isomers, namely the one in which the DNPH group at 0 - 20 is syn with respect to the adjacent hydroxyl group and that the bathochromic shift in the ultraviolet spectra is due to stabilization of an excited resonance state by hydrogen bonding. Adrenosterone-bis-DNPH did not fall into any of the above groups and was considered separately. It was red-orange (λmax. = 376, εmax. = 43, 600) and decomposed without melting. Infrared absorption spectra of all compounds are presented. These spectra indicate whether the compound is a mono- or bis- dinitrophenylhydrazone, whether the steroid had any hydroxyl groups and whether the original steroid had any carbonyl groups in unreactive positions, such as the C- 11 position. In the case of the mono-dinitrophenylhydrazones the infrared spectra were detailed enough to identify the specific steroid empirically. Results are presented for the separation of mixtures of steroid DNPH's by various chromatographic systems. The system finally adopted consisted of alumina, previously treated with a solution of 1 per cent ethanol in benzene, as the stationary phase and benzene, methylene chloride as eluents. This system was used to separate a metabolite of testosterone as the dinitrophenylhydrazone, after incubation with human serum, from the un-metabolized substrate. By means of melting point determination, ultraviolet absorption spectra and infrared absorption spectra this metabolite was identified as Δ 4 -androstenedione, which is in agreement with similar results previously published...|$|E
