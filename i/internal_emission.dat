The energy lobbies have played a big role in this decision." [...] However, Germany's voluntary commitment to reduce CO2 emissions by 21% from the level in 1990 has practically been met, because emission has already been reduced by 19%.

40|$|A {{relativistic}} and manifestly gauge-invariant soft-photon amplitude, {{which is}} consistent with the soft-photon theorem and satisfies the Pauli principle, is derived for the proton-proton bremsstrahlung process. This soft-photon amplitude is the first two-u-two-t special amplitude to satisfy all theoretical constraints. The conventional Low amplitude can be obtained as a special case. It is demonstrated that previously proposed amplitudes for this process, both the (u,t) and (s,t) classes, violate the Pauli principle at some level. The origin of the Pauli principle violation is shown to come from two sources: (i) For the (s,t) class, the two-s-two-t amplitude transforms into the two-s-two-u amplitude under the interchange of two initial-state (or final-state) protons. (ii) For the (Id,t) class, the use of an <b>internal</b> <b>emission</b> amplitude determined from the gauge-invariance constraint alone, without imposition of the Pauli principle, causes a problem. The resulting <b>internal</b> <b>emission</b> amplitude can depend upon an electromagnetic factor which is not invariant under the interchange of the two protons...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the effective dose delivered to patients undergoing sentinel lymph node (SLN) lymphoscintigraphy by {{taking into account}} both the transmission dose using the CT component of a SPECT/CT system and the 99 mTc <b>internal</b> <b>emission</b> dose. Materials and methods: An adult female humanoid phantom {{and a set of}} thermoluminescent dosimeters were used in dose measurement from the CT transmission irradiation. The choice of measurement organs in the humanoid was guided by the recommendations described in the International Commission on Radiological Protection report number 103 (ICRP- 103). The effective doses due to 99 mTc <b>internal</b> <b>emission</b> source were re-calculated from measurement data reported in our previous study on the same subject with the use of tissue weighting factors of ICRP- 103. Results: CT transmission dose is the main contribution to the patient total effective dose for both 1 -day and 2 -day lymphoscintigraphy protocols and for different surgical procedures. Patients undergoing SLN lymphoscintigraphy receive about the same amount of total effective dose of about 3 mSv for both 1 -day and 2 -day protocol, regardless of whether the tissues containing radioactivity would be excised at surgery or not. Conclusion: Although the total effective dose from using SPECT/CT is equivalent to the annual natural background radiation of about 3 mSv, nuclear medicine physicians {{should be aware of the}} increase in effective dose for SLN lymphoscintigraphy using hybrid imaging technique of SPECT/CT when compared to conventional planar 57 Co flood source for transmission scan.

" Yet there are neither clear definitions for the scope of emissions that such a label would address on an urban scale, nor is there a process for qualifying the carbon reduction claims. This paper addresses {{the question of how}} to define a zero carbon, Low Carbon, or Carbon Neutral urban development by proposing hierarchical emissions categories with three levels: <b>Internal</b> <b>Emissions</b> based on the geographical boundary, external emissions directly caused by core municipal activities, and <b>internal</b> or external <b>emissions</b> due to non-core activities.

Here we consider specifically light incident on a horizontally homogeneous foliage ('the canopy'), modeled as a turbid medium. This is often treated by integrating numerically the light transport equation, assuming initial values for the reflected radiances, and iterating until the radiances stabilize. We here present a method combining transfer matrices, transmission-reflection matrices, and Green's matrices (TTRG). This method is both fast and accurate, especially if one must do many computations on the same canopy, for different incident fluxes and <b>internal</b> <b>emissions.</b> There exist (artificial) extreme light trapping situations for which iterative integration is hardly practical, while TTRG remains as efficient.

We show that one can reproduce both the observed lightcurve and the apparent spectral evolution of several GRBs using a model invoking a power-law spectrum with an exponential cut off.

40|$|We {{investigate}} anisotropic lattice relaxation in non-c-plane InGaN/GaN multiple quantum wells(MQWs). Transmission {{electron microscopy}} analyses of semipolar (11 { 2 ¯} 2) MQWs reveal that lattice relaxation preferentially occurs along the [{ 1 ¯}{ 1 ¯} 23] direction by introducing misfit dislocations (MDs) with a Burgers vector of {⅓}[11 { 2 ¯} 0]. To theoretically describe this anisotropic relaxation phenomenon, we expand the force-balance model, where {{the competition between}} the force induced by lattice mismatch and the tension of dislocations determines the motion of dislocations. Furthermore, because MDs are introduced at the interface between the bottom InGaNQW and the underlying GaN, we propose to treat InGaN/GaN MQWs as InGaN single layers with effective In compositions. Applying this structure model to the theoretical calculation of the critical layer thicknesses reproduces well the experimentally observed lattice relaxation. This achievement enables us to design semipolar InGaN/GaN MQWstructures without lattice relaxation, thereby realizing higher <b>internal</b> <b>emission</b> quantum efficiencies...|$|E

40|$|Radiative {{transfer}} is analyzed in a semitransparent coating on an opaque substrate {{and in a}} semitransparent layer for evaluating thermal protection behavior and ceramic component performance in high temperature applications. Some ceramics are partially transparent for radiative transfer, and at high temperatures <b>internal</b> <b>emission</b> and reflections affect their thermal performance. The behavior is examined for a ceramic component for which interior cooling is not provided. Two conditions are considered: (1) the layer is heated by penetration of radiation from hot surroundings while its external surface is simultaneously film cooled by convection, and (2) the surface is heated by convection while the semitransparent material cools from within by radiant emission leaving through the surface. By using the two-flux method, which {{has been found to}} yield good accuracy in previous studies, a special solution is obtained for these conditions.

40|$|The {{planetary}} Gravitational power, {{derived from}} the pushing gravity {{in the frame of}} the Micro-quanta paradigm, opens new insights on the physics of solar planets. It has been observed in the past that the infrared <b>internal</b> <b>emission</b> from the giant solar planets is much higher (7 - 10 times) than the emission of bodies cooling in space. This agrees with the predicted Gravitational power, which {{in the case of the}} Earth results about 60 times the classical heat flow estimated through the temperature gradient within the continents. This bias points out once again the problem of the high terrestrial seismic activity that can hardly be attributed to the thermal stresses produced by the classical heat flow crossing the crust. The new Gravitational power is able to explain both the seismic activity and the oscillations of the surface temperature, such as the rapid warming named Dansgaard-Oeschger events, which are recorded from 11. 500 yr up to 45. 000 yr B.

The Si QDs are {{formed in the}} near-surface region of an SiO 2 substrate by Si ion implantation and thermal annealing. Photoluminescence decay-rate distributions, as derived from an inverse Laplace transform of the measured decay trace, are determined for samples with and without a Ag cover layer. For the smallest, investigated Si-QDs-to-interface distance of 44 nm the average decay rate at lambda= 750 nm is enhanced by 80 % due to {{the proximity of the}} Ag-glass interface, with respect to an air-glass interface. Calculations based on a classical dipole oscillator model show that the observed decay rate enhancement is mainly due to the excitation of surface plasmons that are on the SiO 2 /Ag interface.
