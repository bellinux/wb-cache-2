25|$|As a {{conversation}} piece people have frequently asked me which of my many wickets has <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> most pleasure...I no longer stop to think. My answer does not concern one wicket but three. Those of Alan Turner and the Chappell brothers, Ian and Greg...I felt each one proved a point. That I was not {{over the hill}} as a Test fast bowler despite having been ignored for eight Test matches at home and two tours abroad. Each of these three batsman was well beaten by a good delivery, two out leg before and Ian Chappell caught behind. Down at leg after that opening spell I bloody nearly cried.|$|E

Marjorie Barnard wrote of their first meeting as being ot entirely happy. I was the greenest of green 'freshers'. Flora was {{established}} in her second year. Chance had <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> locker immediately above hers. Its untidy contents frequently spilled out into her more ordered domain. My then meager person was continually underfoot, and Flora's brown eyes flashed with indignation more often than they smiled. But within the year we were close friends. She widened my horizons and quickened my mind. Later this friendship was to withstand what everyone agrees to be the acid test of collaboration in writing.|$|E

500|$|It was in New Hampshire where Huntsman adopted his new [...] "Country First" [...] {{campaign}} slogan. The slogan was {{borrowed from}} John McCain's 2008 campaign, though {{the context of}} the slogan was different. Huntsman, who, as Governor of Utah at the time, endorsed McCain over Mitt Romney in the 2008 Republican presidential primary, had hoped McCain would return the favor; however, McCain endorsed Romney in a rally at Manchester's Manchester Central High School on January 4. Huntsman later characterized McCain's endorsement of his main rival as a [...] "petty betrayal". He told McCain [...] "I don't care if you support Romney, that's great – but just to have <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> dignity of waiting until after the New Hampshire primary." [...] McCain replied, [...] "I didn't mean to offend. I hope your family is well." ...|$|E

500|$|Olivia {{continued}} to socialise and had many friends, one of whom, Wyndham Lewis, painted her portrait; he enjoyed her company despite finding {{it difficult to}} relate to others. She stopped writing but remained an avid reader, turning to detective stories for light relief although she also kept up with literary authors. She became friendly with Thomas MacGreevy, whom she invited for tea, later writing to him, [...] "WBY has <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> new edition of Reveries and the Veil, & I am re-reading it all. It is very beautifully done. He was about 29 when I first knew him". McGreevy told Yeats that Olivia was [...] "always a symbol of elegance, a kind of gold and ivory image". Harwood writes of her, [...] "Olivia Shakespear was avant-garde in literature, agnostic in religion, and conservative in politics, at least later in life".|$|E

500|$|At {{the age of}} 69 he was 'rejuvenated' by the Steinach {{operation}} {{which was}} performed on 6 April 1934 by Norman Haire. For {{the last five years}} of his life Yeats found a new vigour evident from both his poetry and his intimate relations with younger women. During this time, Yeats was involved in a number of romantic affairs with, among others, the poet and actress Margot Ruddock, and the novelist, journalist and sexual radical Ethel Mannin. As in his earlier life, Yeats found erotic adventure conducive to his creative energy, and, despite age and ill-health, he remained a prolific writer. In a letter of 1935, Yeats noted: [...] "I find my present weakness made worse by the strange second puberty the operation has <b>given</b> <b>me,</b> <b>the</b> ferment that has come upon my imagination. If I write poetry it will be unlike anything I have done". In 1936, he undertook editorship of the Oxford Book of Modern Verse, 1892–1935.|$|E
500|$|... "Love Don't Live Here Anymore" [...] {{incorporated}} {{the use of}} the Electronic LinnDrum machine, {{and was one of the}} first songs to effectively use the sound reverbs of the instrument. LinnDrum had been used sparingly in their previous single [...] "Do Your Dance", but in [...] "Love Don't Live Here Anymore" [...] its use was more spontaneous, which Dave Thompson, author of Funk noted as if [...] "it virtually duetted with Dickey, creating one of the most distinctive records of the year—and one of the most imitated of the age." [...] The song was mainly recorded at music contractor Gene Bianco's house, where Rose Royce lead singer Gwen Dickey was present during the recording. Buckmaster recalled: [...] "I was over at [...] place almost every day with Norman, and some days I stayed away to write, or to mix the music. Gene had <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> keys to his apartment, and also let me use the piano to record the song. I didn't want to work on at Miles' because his piano was falling to bits." ...|$|E
500|$|The second witness {{called by}} the defense was United Press International (UPI) {{journalist}} and Hendrix's friend Sharon Lawrence, who testified that she was with Hendrix in California when, after complaining about feeling ill, an unnamed fan gave him something. When Malone suggested that her memory was suspiciously acute, she explained that her training as a reporter prepared her to notice fine details. Hendrix's manager and producer, Chas Chandler, was called next, and he corroborated the defense's assertion that rock stars, particularly Hendrix, would regularly receive gifts from fans and that those gifts often included drugs. In its closing argument, the defense reiterated {{that in order to}} be guilty of possession of narcotics Hendrix had to have knowledge of the illegal drugs. After a trial that had lasted for three days, the jury deliberated for more than eight hours before returning a not guilty verdict, acquitting Hendrix of both charges. Torontoist Kevin Plummer wrote: [...] "As the all-male jury announced its acquittal, the courtroom—crowded with young people—erupted into applause." [...] In remarks to reporters after the verdict was announced, Hendrix commented: [...] "Canada has <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> best Christmas present I ever had", while flashing a peace sign.|$|E

500|$|Similar {{to most of}} {{the songs}} from Light Years, [...] "Spinning Around" [...] is a [...] "string-laden" [...] dance-pop track with {{prominent}} influences from disco music. According to the sheet music of the song published by BMG Rights Management at Musicnotes.com, it is composed in the key of F minor and features a moderate tempo of 120 beats per minute. Minogue's vocal range spans from the low note of F3 to the high note of C5. Addressing the theme of reinvention, the lyrics declare that Minogue has changed and learned from her past mistakes; it contains lines like [...] "I'm spinning around/Move out of my way... I'm not the same" [...] and [...] "Mistakes that I made have <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> strength to really believe." [...] In an analysis of the lyrics of the song, Pom Avoledo from Blogcritics wrote that Minogue demands attention in the chorus towards the changes in her personality and asserts that people appreciate them, in the line [...] "I know you're feelin me cause you like it like this." [...] The first verse deals with Minogue ridding herself of items and symbols from her past and starting afresh, evidenced in lines like [...] "Threw away my old clothes, got myself a better wardrobe." [...] The critic felt that in the second verse Minogue faces her mistakes and accepts herself as she is. The bridge of the song features the repetition of the hook [...] "You know you like it like this," [...] with Minogue's voice being vocoded. Chris True from AllMusic felt that through the lyrics, Minogue was admitting that releasing Impossible Princess in 1997 was not the best decision.|$|E
