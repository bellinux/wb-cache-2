40|$|Abstract—In traffic {{accident}} investigation, measurement {{and location of}} accident factors using traditional methods is a time-consuming work. Investigators must work on each measurement point to collect data, and then mark {{the position of the}} measured point in the scene graph. Due to the low efficiency of manual operation, the investigation time is long, thereby increasing the traffic recovery pressure. In order to solve the above-mentioned problem, this paper describes a wireless location system to graphically record the scene of road {{traffic accident}}. This system combines the ultrasonic technology and ZIGBEE wireless communication network, which firstly installs <b>distance</b> <b>measuring</b> <b>equipments</b> at all the measurement points including two reference points and other ones, and then completes the measurement work in one time. Use of ultrasonic technique guarantees the accuracy of distance measurement while ZIGBEE wireless communication network facilitates remote control device.

40|$|AbstractL-band digital {{aeronautical}} {{communication system}} 1 (L-DACS 1) is a promising candidate data-link for future air-ground communication, {{but it is}} severely interfered by the pulse pairs (PPs) generated by <b>distance</b> <b>measure</b> <b>equipment.</b> A novel PP mitigation approach is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a deformed PP detection (DPPD) method that combines a filter bank, correlation detection, and rescanning is proposed to detect the deformed PPs (DPPs) which are caused by multiple filters in the receiver. Secondly, a finite impulse response (FIR) model is used to approximate the overall characteristic of filters, and then the waveform of DPP can be acquired by the original waveform of PP and the FIR model. Finally, sparse representation is used to estimate the position and amplitude of each DPP, and then reconstruct each DPP. The reconstructed DPPs will be subtracted from the contaminated signal to mitigate interference. Numerical experiments show that the bit error rate performance of our approach is about 5 dB better than that of recent works and is closer to interference-free environment...|$|R

Despite the warnings on the navigation charts, the test aircraft was able to navigate by using the MAC VOR during the entire flight. However, the MAC VOR is also equipped with <b>distance</b> <b>measuring</b> <b>equipment,</b> or DME, which provides a means for pilots to know the distance between their aircraft and the VOR/DME station.

40|$|International audienceThe {{reliability}} and robustness of electronic subsystems dedicated {{to control and}} communications in the aerospace sector is more than ever {{one of the key}} points for safety and security, essentially during landing operations. As aircraft manufacturers have to diversify their mean of communication system's control (Full-Duplex and System), the reliability can be improved both by setting redundant remote networks, and also by using matched technologies for increased performances and robustness: the wide band-gap Gallium Nitride technology (GaN) newly developed fits perfectly to the requirements of systems such as Microwave Landing System (MLS) or <b>Distance</b> <b>Measuring</b> <b>Equipments</b> (DME) used during the final landing approach. Actually, GaN technology takes advantage of a natural immunity to electromagnetic perturbations, and is suitable for circuit design in the RF frequency band (up to 5 GHz for aircraft applications). The GaN based circuits are able to improve transceiver's efficiency (and so the radio-link budget) thanks to their low noise figure (receiver) and high output power (transmitter), reducing digital bit error rate during the code demodulation. This point is crucial while electronic runs in an urban environment. Moreover, the next electronic systems developed for " composite aircraft " will be more exposed to high electric field and CEM problems in circuits. Furthermore, this GaN integrated technology allows a reduction of volume for transmitter's subsystems, and is easy to setup (aircraft maintenance) : the risk of immobilisation during the aircraft exploitation will be reduced and his maintainability will be easier. Finally, this technology is also perfectly suited for ground navigation control systems such as radar. This work presents the challenge for civil and military future avionic systems by making use of GaN based technologies...|$|R

The latter allowed the airport status as an international airport, which allowed charter flights to Sweden, Denmark and the United Kingdom, which were often done on a weekly basis by foreign companies involved in the heavy industry. However, the airport did not have status as a permanent border control and the airport therefore had to cover these costs themselves. The Ministry of Justice stated that the airport was too close to Flesland, Haugesund and Sola to have permanent status, but allowed the chief-of-police to give dispensations for individual flights from 1988.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a further {{generalization}} of differential evolution based data classification method is proposed, demonstrated and initially evaluated. The differential evolution classifier is a nearest prototype vector based classifier that applies a global optimization algorithm, differential evolution, {{for determining the}} optimal values for all free parameters of the classifier model during the training phase of the classifier. The earlier version of differential evolution classifier that applied individually optimized <b>distance</b> <b>measure</b> for each new data set to be classified is generalized here so, that instead of optimizing a single <b>distance</b> <b>measure</b> for the given data set, we take a further step by proposing an approach where <b>distance</b> <b>measures</b> are optimized individually for each feature of the data set to be classified. In particular, <b>distance</b> <b>measures</b> for each feature are selected optimally from a predefined pool of alternative <b>distance</b> <b>measures.</b> The optimal <b>distance</b> <b>measures</b> are determined by differential evolution algorithm, which is also determining the optimal values for all free parameters of the selected <b>distance</b> <b>measures</b> in parallel. After determining the optimal <b>distance</b> <b>measures</b> for each feature together with their optimal parameters, we combine all featurewisely determined <b>distance</b> <b>measures</b> to form a single total <b>distance</b> <b>measure,</b> {{that is to be}} applied for the final classification decisions. The actual classification process is still based on the nearest prototype vector principle; A sample belongs to the class represented by the nearest prototype vector when measured with the above referred optimized total <b>distance</b> <b>measure.</b> During the training process the differential evolution algorithm determines optimally the class vectors, selects optimal distance metrics for each data feature, and determines the optimal values for the free parameters of each selected <b>distance</b> <b>measure.</b> Based on experimental results with nine well known classification benchmark data sets, the proposed approach yield a statistically significant improvement to the classification accuracy of differential evolution classifier.
