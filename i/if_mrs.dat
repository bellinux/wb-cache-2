500|$|Before the Thraliana, Thrale kept {{two sets}} of anecdotes: the first was devoted to Samuel Johnson {{and the other for}} {{miscellaneous}} events. She relied on these, along with her memory, to write the early portions of her work. Boswell, when trying to find information for his own work, wrote: [...] "Mr. Thrale told me, I am not sure what day, that there is a Book of Johnsoniana kept int heir Family, in which all Mr. Johnson's sayings and all that they can collect about him is put down ... I must try to get this Thralian Miscellany, to assist me in writing Mr. Johnson's Life, <b>if</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Thrale does not intend to do it herself." [...] After Johnson's death, Thrale used the Thraliana to create the Anecdotes of the Late Samuel Johnson (1786). The manuscript passed through many hands and was owned by A. Edward Newton until his death in autumn 1940. The Thraliana was eventually published in 1942, and it was produced by the Clarendon Press in England while its editor, Katharine Balderston, was prohibited from travelling across the ocean from Wellesley College because of World War II.|$|E

2500|$|In a January 5, 1995, {{interview}} with Kathleen Gingrich, mother of Republican politician Newt Gingrich, on Eye to Eye, Mrs. Gingrich {{said she could}} not say what her son thought about First Lady Hillary Clinton on the air. Chung asked Mrs. Gingrich to [...] "just whisper it to me, just between you and me," [...] and Mrs. Gingrich replied that her son thought of Clinton as a [...] "bitch". Many people interpreted Chung's suggestion that <b>if</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Gingrich would whisper this statement it would be promised that the statement would be off the record. Bill Carter for The New York Times reported, [...] "Ms. Chung had become the object {{of some of the}} most ferocious criticism, justified or not, ever directed at any network anchor as a result of her now infamous {{interview with}} Speaker Newt Gingrich's mother, Kathleen."

40|$|The {{next phase}} of Mars {{exploration}} will utilize numerous globally distributed small low-cost devices including landers penetrators microrovers and balloons. Direct-to-Earth communications links if required for these landers will drive the lander design for two reasons: a) mass and complexity needed for a steerable high-gain antenna and b) power requirements for a high-power amplifier (i. e. solar panel and battery mass). Total mass of the direct link hardware for several recent small-lander designs exceeded {{the mass of the}} scientific payload. Alternatively if communications are via a Mars-orbiting relay spacecraft resource requirements for the local UHF communication link are comparatively trivial: a simple whip antenna and less than 1 watt power. Clearly using a Mars relay spacecraft (MRS) is the preferred option <b>if</b> the <b>MRS</b> mission can be accomplished in an affordable and robust way.

40|$|Many {{changes have}} taken place since the SCP safety {{strategy}} was formulated; {{it needs to be}} revised or replaced. Four concepts would aid in the shift from a rigid, ecelctic, schedule-driven, all-or-nothing program to an incremental, evolving, and experimental but integrated program. These are a simple safety case, reversability, demonstrability, and decoupling operations of a repository from operation of reactors. A simple safety case based on containment can be made for a repository at Yucca Mountain. This containment strategy is based on the dryness of openings at Yucca Mountain, Extended Dry heat management, and long-lived containers. Reversibility is technically believable at Yucca Mountain because of extended retrievability and drift emplacement, <b>if</b> an <b>MRS</b> were co-located with the repository. Because the rock is unsaturated, extended retrievability is technically feasible at Yucca Mountain. Demonstrability could be improved at Yucca Mountain by planning for incremental progression toward operation and closure of a repository, possibly including a shift to underground retrievable storage. Demonstrability can also be improved by using natural analogs. Repository operation can be decoupled from reactor operation by use of an unconstrained MRS facility or at-reactor dry storage and multipurpose storage canister/casks...|$|R

Smailey tries to buy it from her, but she's respectable now: She won't take his money, though she keeps the papers as she [...] "ain't a fool"; Smailey leaves. Fitz-Partington interviews Ruth, to her confusion. Mrs. Van Brugh re-enters, and Fitz-Partington warns her about Smailey, explaining that his detective agency was called on to find out about Smailey's fraud, but as Smailey then hired him to investigate Mrs. Van Brugh, they had combined the cases. However, Fitz-Partington goes on to ask several further questions about Mrs. Van Brugh's marriage, and she begins to realise what Smailey is looking for: <b>if</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Van Brugh's godfather had called her Captain Van Brugh's wife in his will, her secret might be revealed. Smailey returns with the will, and reads out the relevant section about the farm, ending with the section referring to her as [...] "Catherine Ellen, wife of Captain Richard Van Brugh."

As Smailey stands to benefit if he can get Mrs. Van Brugh removed as beneficiary of her godfather's will, he plans to commence proceedings to get what's his. Ruth is furious and announces that if he does so, she'll reveal the evidence of his past fraud. Smailey tries to weasel out of it, saying that [...] "Mrs. Van Brugh would admit the justice of his claim", and he gets Ruth to agree that <b>if</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Van Brugh makes a statement of her own free will, Ruth will let it pass. As Ruth leaves, Smailey rants about the injustice of his past sin being held over his head, whilst planning to condemn Mrs. Van Brugh for her past.|$|E
2500|$|Mrs Morrell left {{an estate}} of £157,000 and made eight cash bequests of between £300 and £1,000. Cullen claims {{that in some}} of the several wills she made Adams was bequeathed large sums of money and her Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost (valued at £1,500). This appears {{incorrect}} and, in her will of 5 August 1950, he was only awarded outright a chest of silver cutlery worth £276, with a contingent right to the car and a Jacobean court cupboard <b>if</b> <b>Mrs</b> Morrell's son pre-deceased her A codicil of 13 September 1950 cut Adams out of her will completely. She died on 13 November 1950 aged 81. Adams certified the cause of death as [...] "stroke" [...] and on inspecting the body, slit her wrist to ensure she was dead. Despite the last codicil, Mrs Morrell's son gave Adams the Rolls-Royce which was 19 years old, and the chest of silver cutlery. After Mrs Morrell's death, he also took away an infrared lamp she had bought herself, worth £60. Adams billed Morrell's estate for 1,100 visits, costing £1,674 in total. The police estimated that Adams had visited Morrell a total of 321 times during her treatment. On her cremation form, Adams stated that [...] "as far as I am aware" [...] he had no pecuniary interest in the death, thereby avoiding the necessity of a post-mortem.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Temperature {{dependent}} chemical {{shifts of}} important brain metabolites measured by localised 1 H MRS were investigated to test how {{the use of}} incorrect prior knowledge on chemical shifts impairs the quantication of metabolite concentrations. Materials and methods: Phantom measurements on solutions containing 11 metabolites were performed on a 7 T scanner between 1 and 43 °C. The temperature dependence of the chemical shift differences was fitted by a linear model. Spectra were simulated for di erent temperatures and analysed by the AQSES program (jMRUI 5. 2) using model functions with chemical shift values for 37 °C. Results: Large differences in the temperature dependence of the chemical shift differences were determined with a maximum slope of about ± 7. 5 × 10 − 4 ppm/K. For 32 – 40 °C, only minor quantification errors resulted from using incorrect chemical shifts, {{with the exception of}} Cr and PCr. For 1 – 10 °C considerable quantification errors occurred if the temperature dependence of the chemical shifts was neglected. Conclusion: <b>If</b> 1 H <b>MRS</b> measurements are not performed at 37 °C, for which the published chemical shift values have been determined, the temperature dependence of chemical shifts should be considered to avoid systematic quantification errors, particularly for measurements on animal models at lower temperatures...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{describes}} {{the use of}} proton MR in cancer pathology. Water-based MRI is, at present, independently unable to identify the pathology of human tumors. The literature and work in this domain indicate that by studying carefully controlled model systems and excised human tissues, 1 H MRS can extract chemical information relating directly to the pathology. In addition, by tailoring data acquisition and processing parameters to report specifically on those molecules of known diagnostic relevance, 1 H MRS can diagnose invasive cancer in many organs ex vivo and some in vivo. 1 H MRS {{has the potential to}} provide an independent modality that can: (1) report on the presence of invasive or preinvasive neoplastic cells in biopsy specimens; (2) detect the microfoci of metastatic cells missed by routine histopathology, and; (3) provide a precise diagnosis to aid in the decision on treatment and subsequent patient management. Cancer can be diagnosed by 1 H <b>MRS</b> <b>if</b> the pathological criteria are linked to specific chemical changes ascertained from intact cells and tissues. This concept was demonstrated by the cervix program where CSI (ex vivo) not only defined the pathology of the tissue but also provided a spatial map of the diseased areas...|$|R
40|$|Cerebral venous {{thrombosis}} (CVT) affects mainly working-aged individuals. Functional recovery after CVT {{is generally considered}} good with about 3 / 4 of patients achieving short-term independence. However, vascular events, long-term functional outcome, and employment after CVT remain poorly investigated. We identified consecutive adult CVT patients treated at the Helsinki University Hospital (1987 - 2013) and invited them to a follow-up visit. Each clinical examination was combined with interview. We also recorded recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) and hemorrhagic events during follow-up and antithrombotic medication use. A modified Rankin Scale (mRS) served to assess functional outcome. Logistic regression served to identify independent factors associated with unemployment and functional recovery. Of the 195 patients identified, 21 died, 9 declined to participate, and 4 {{were excluded from the}} study. Thus, 161 patients (106 women) underwent an examination after a median of 39 months (interquartile range 14 - 95). VTE (one of which was CVT) occurred in 9 (6 %) patients, and severe hemorrhagic events in 10 (6 %). Functional outcome was good, with 84 % scoring 0 - 1 on the mRS; 42 % reported residual symptoms. Altogether, 91 (57 %) patients were employed. After adjusting for age and sex, a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score > 2 at admission and low education level, associated with both unfavorable functional outcome and unemployment. Long-term functional outcome after CVT may appear good <b>if</b> measured with <b>mRS,</b> but patients often have residual symptoms and are frequently unable to return to their previous work...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundContrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) after {{percutaneous}} coronary {{intervention in}} patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a common complication associated with worse outcome. Considering the prognostic predictive value of the red cell distribution width (RDW), we aimed to measure the usefulness of RDW for predicting CI-AKI. MethodsAll consecutive STEMI patients without hemodialysis from June 2011 to September 2013 admitted to St. Luke's International Hospital were enrolled. We performed primary percutaneous coronary intervention in all patients. CI-AKI {{was defined as a}} > 25 % increase or an absolute increase in serum creatinine of 0. 5 mg/dl within 3 days after percutaneous coronary intervention. The potential additional predictive value of RDW with the Mehran risk score (MRS) on admission was estimated. ResultsA total of 102 patients (78. 4 % males) were analyzed – 10 of the 102 (10 %) STEMI patients developed CI-AKI. Multivariate analysis showed that RDW was an independent variable predicting CI-AKI in these patients [odds ratio, 2. 029; 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI), 1. 029 – 3. 999; p= 0. 041]. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for MRS only, RDW only, and the combined model (MRS and RDW) for the prediction of CI-AKI were 0. 806 (95 % CI, 0. 696 – 0. 917), 0. 719 (95 % CI, 0. 536 – 0. 902), and 0. 846 (95 % CI, 0. 744 – 0. 949), respectively. ConclusionWe showed the potential predictive ability of RDW, only <b>if</b> used with <b>MRS,</b> for CI-AKI in STEMI patients. Further evaluation of RDW for predicting CI-AKI {{in patients with}} STEMI is needed...|$|R
