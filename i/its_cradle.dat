25|$|At this time, {{the region}} was the home of many {{important}} religious figures and zawiyas. The Draa {{became part of the}} marabout movement against the Portuguese who had captured many towns at the Atlantic coast. The Draa made an important comeback in the history of Morocco with the rise of the dynasty of the Saadi or Bani Zaydan as their original name was. <b>Its</b> <b>cradle</b> was in the Draa valley in Tagmadert, the current district of Fezouata between Zagora and Tamegroute. Although there is still a village called Timidert today, some historians think Tagmadert was situated at today's Amezrou, a village next to Zagora. Thanks to the Saadi Dynasty the Draa {{played an important role in}} the history of Morocco and the Sahara during the 16th century. In the middle of that century the Saadi Dynasty was at the height of its power. In that time the need for gold was increasing and the sultan Ahmad al-Mansur decided to undertake the conquest of the Sudan in 1590. According to some sources, this conquest had its cause in the events of 1545 when under the reign of Mohammed ash-Sheikh the palm orchards of the Ktawa in the Draa were captured by the Tuareg Oulmiden who were sent by Ishaq I, king of the Sudan.|$|E
500|$|Today I {{am afraid}} that fish in most of those rivers are {{virtually}} extinct. Anybody who stands today in the City of Manchester outside the Exchange Station and {{looks down at the}} noisome black water which flows beneath him would find it difficult to believe that any fish, or any other living creature, could ever have lived in what the Manchester Guardian has so rightly called that [...] "melancholy stream"... I have had my differences with the British Field Sports Society, but I have nothing but admiration for the excellent series of reports on river pollution which have been prepared for that Society... and ventured to suggest that they should make a similar survey of the Rivers Irwell and Roach. These two rivers were covered by the third report; and very sorry reading it made. There are two passages in that report which I should like to read. The first says: [...] "The banks are lined with factories, large and small, many of which take their water from the drainage of the hills forming the slopes of the river's valley, and discharge it as a polluted effluent, either into the small feeders, or the main river itself, so it may be said that no natural water normally enters the river from <b>its</b> <b>cradle</b> in the moors to its grave in the Manchester Ship Canal." [...] The second quotation is one which I find still more appalling than the first. It is: [...] "There are no fish in these rivers (apart from a very occasional tributary), no insects, no weeds, no life of any kind except sewage fungus, nothing but chemicals and any dirt which cannot be put to profitable use. Sewage effluents (and, being usually very good, they are the most encouraging feature of the appalling situation) are hailed with delight as being the purest water which the rivers hold." [...] The full importance of that statement will be realised when I remind hon. Members of the frequency with which residents in Bacup, Ramsbottom, Manchester and Salford are subjected to flooding from the waters of the Irwell.|$|E

2500|$|Hazlitt {{felt that}} Tooke would be longest remembered, however, for his ideas about English grammar. By {{far the most}} popular English grammar of the early 19th century was that of Lindley Murray, and, in his typical method of {{criticism}} by antitheses, Hazlitt points out what he considers to be its glaring deficiencies {{compared to that of}} Tooke: [...] "Mr. Lindley Murray's Grammar ... confounds the genius of the English language, making it periphrastic and literal, instead of elliptical and idiomatic." [...] Murray, as well as other, earlier grammarians, often provided [...] "endless details and subdivisions"; Tooke, in his work commonly known by its alternate title of The Diversions of Purley, [...] "clears away the rubbish of school-boy technicalities, and strikes at the root of his subject." [...] Tooke's mind was particularly suited for his task, as it was [...] "hard, unbending, concrete, physical, half-savage ..." [...] and he could see [...] "language stripped of the clothing of habit or sentiment, or the disguises of doting pedantry, naked in <b>its</b> <b>cradle,</b> and in its primitive state." [...] That Murray's book should have been the grammar to have [...] "proceeded to [...] thirtieth edition" [...] and find a place in all the schools instead of [...] "Horne Tooke's genuine anatomy of the English tongue" [...] makes it seem, exclaims Hazlitt, [...] "as if there was a patent for absurdity in the natural bias of the human mind, and that folly should be stereotyped!".|$|E
