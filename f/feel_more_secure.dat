5|$|Representation at the League {{was often}} a problem. Though it was {{intended}} to encompass all nations, many never joined, or their period of membership was short. The most conspicuous absentee was the United States. President Woodrow Wilson had been a driving force behind the League's formation and strongly influenced the form it took, but the US Senate voted not to join on 19 November 1919. Ruth Henig has suggested that, had the United States become a member, it would have also provided support to France and Britain, possibly making France <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> <b>secure,</b> and so encouraging France and Britain to co-operate more fully regarding Germany, thus making the rise to power of the Nazi Party less likely. Conversely, Henig acknowledges that if the US had been a member, its reluctance to engage in war with European states or to enact economic sanctions might have hampered the ability of the League to deal with international incidents. The structure of the US federal government might also have made its membership problematic, as its representatives at the League could not have made decisions on behalf of the executive branch without having the prior approval of the legislative branch.|$|E

25|$|Noten's work The Pistol Saints (2003) {{is part of}} the Design Against Crime project. Whenever Noten {{asked people}} why they carried a gun they said it made them <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> <b>secure,</b> {{although}} most of them never actually used their gun. This inspired him to copy what he called the soul of the gun in pieces of jewellery the owner could wear instead of the gun. The Pistol Saints consists of twelve golden brooches with imprints of a gun. On the brooches the gun markings can be clearly distinguished.|$|E

The Düsseldorf-born player <b>feels</b> <b>more</b> <b>secured</b> in the field on the position of the central defensive midfielder, but in Germany he played sometimes even as a right-back or even a centre-back. The most striking feature in Petsos' game is its excellent shooting technique.|$|R

25|$|Regular {{cyclical}} {{lighting is}} used in aquariums to simulate day and night. This is beneficial for fish and invertebrates since it establishes a routine, enables them to rest, and makes them <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> <b>secure.</b> Aside from establishing a routine, high output lighting is required for many invertebrates such as corals and anemones to survive. Lighting in marine tanks that contain only fish and live rock is not an important issue. In aquariums containing invertebrates, however, where algal growth (of both free-living and symbiotic algae) is desired, more intense lighting is required. Various light sources include {{but are not limited}} to: natural sunlight, fluorescent, VHO fluorescent (Very High Output), T-5 fluorescent, compact fluorescent, LED and metal halide. Each type of lighting has its own advantages and disadvantages. They all vary in initial cost, maintenance cost, spectrum obtainable, longevity, efficiency, and power.|$|E
25|$|While an inexperienced rider may <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> <b>secure</b> with a {{slightly}} too-short stirrup, in reality, it is actually easier to be thrown from the horse because the rider's legs act as a stabilizing agent, much {{in the same way}} the long pole of a tightrope walker balances the acrobat. Obviously, a stirrup leather so long that a rider cannot reach it is useless, and a stirrup length that does not allow a rider with a properly positioned leg to keep the heel lower than the toe is also easily lost. However, shortening the stirrup until the rider feels they will not lose the stirrup is counterproductive; the goal of correct equestrianism is to make maximum use of the leg. Lengthening the leg creates a more secure seat, while shortening the stirrup is done only to accommodate the needs of the horse to perform athletic movement. Thus correct stirrup length creates a balance between control and mobility that fits the discipline performed.|$|E
500|$|Some Circuit Courts {{have applied}} the Court's ruling in Drayton {{to hold that}} {{citizens}} are not coerced when police officers approach individuals {{on the street and}} ask them questions. The District of Columbia Circuit, for example, wrote that [...] "while the passengers in Drayton were questioned while inside a bus with an officer positioned near the exit ... the street encounter [...] no physical impediment to ’s freedom to walk away". However, the Seventh Circuit has held that according to the Supreme Court's ruling in Drayton, a suspect was unlawfully detained when police approached him in a dark alley and asked him questions. The Seventh Circuit described the encounter as [...] "coercive" [...] and distinguished it from the events that transpired in Drayton because [...] "lleys are distinguishable from the sorts of open, populated spaces in which police questioning is typically deemed consensual". The court noted that [...] "'a reasonable person may <b>feel</b> ... <b>more</b> <b>secure</b> in his or her decision not to cooperate with police on a bus than in other circumstances' because 'many fellow passengers are present [...] to witness officers’ conduct'".|$|E
30|$|Farmers who {{experienced}} moderately secured perception of land property rights {{are found to}} bend more likely to non-farm activities than those who feel less secured. On the margin and keeping other factors constant, farmers who <b>feel</b> moderately <b>more</b> <b>secured</b> about their land rights were 40 % units more likely to adopt the joint activities than farmers who feel less protected. This is because when farm households <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> <b>secured</b> about their lands, they may hire out their lands and engage in non-farming activities. For instance, in the study area, some farmers are buying horse and cart and engaged in transporting commodities from home to market and the reverse. Agricultural landowners who feel secured about their farmland ownership are found to participate more intensively in land conservation programs (Yeboah et al. 2015) than their counterparts. Other studies (Bravo-Monroy et al. 2016) found out that farm households who felt secured about their land right were found to adopt agroforestry, and likewise the study (Meinzen-Dick and Mwangi 2009) indicated that formalising property rights in Kenya could reduce ecological stress.|$|R

After sending several works back home to the Academy, he was awarded money from the fund. <b>Feeling</b> <b>more</b> <b>secure,</b> in 1837 he married Bolette Jacobsen, the daughter of a local merchant.|$|R
50|$|The {{lyrics are}} {{ambiguous}} {{and deal with}} parents-children relationships. It is both a love and reproachful song towards the two parents : a version for the mother {{and one for the}} father, but it is unknown whether the song is blaming the parents or thanking them. However, some verses clearly refer to incest: it is evoked through an allegory ("petit bouton de rose, aux pétales humides un baiser je dépose") and a phonetic pun ("tes câlins cessent toute ecchymose"). The song seems to be constructed as a dialogue between Farmer and her mother who addresses many criticisms to her daughter. The singer says she <b>feels</b> <b>more</b> <b>secure</b> with her father.|$|R

In the official video, there is archive footage of Michael Jackson from the original 1985 recording. Richie said that he agreed with Katherine's request, commenting, [...] "It made me <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> <b>secure</b> about this. We definitely felt a void.

It's helpful to have parents set limits on things like cross-dressing, which many parents have not done before coming to us." [...] Zucker's follow-up of 50 treated children found that [...] "about 10 percent are still very unhappy about their gender, still cross-dressing, and thinking about having sex reassignment surgery" [...] as young adults.

5000|$|Over {{the course}} of a trip from Colorado to California, Michael comes to trust Hawk, {{especially}} after Hawk rescues him from kidnappers (who were actually goons hired by Cutler to retrieve Mike). However, when they arrive at the hospital, Hawk is despondent to learn they have arrived too late; as Christina died in surgery earlier that day. Feeling he would have been there with her if not for Hawk, Michael leaves for his grandfather's estate. An attempt to retrieve Michael ends with Hawk being arrested for trespassing when he resorts to ramraiding after being turned away from Cutler's gated mansion. Michael visits his father in jail and forgives him, but tells Hawk that he <b>feels</b> <b>more</b> <b>secure</b> living with his grandfather.|$|R
5000|$|Popularity is {{positively}} linked to job satisfaction, individual job performance, and group performance. [...] The popular worker, besides just feeling {{more satisfied with}} his job, <b>feels</b> <b>more</b> <b>secure,</b> believes he has better working conditions, trusts his supervisor, and possesses more positive opportunities for communication with both management and co-workers, causing a greater feeling of responsibility and belongingness at work. [...] Others prefer to work with popular individuals, most notably in manual labor jobs because, although {{they might not be}} the most knowledgeable for the job, they are approachable, willing to help, cooperative in group work, {{and are more likely to}} treat their coworkers as an equal.

60|$|The special grievance, Gregorio's influence, had {{scarcely}} dwelt on her {{at first}} {{as it had}} done on her mother. The man had been very cautious for some time, knowing that his continuance in his situation was in the utmost jeopardy, and Mr. Egremont had, in the freshness of his grief for his wife, abstained from relapsing into the habits from which she had weaned him. When, however, the Canon was dead, and his son at a distance, Gregorio began to <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> <b>secure,</b> and in the restless sorrow of his master over the blow that had taken away an only brother, he administered soothing drugs under another name, so that Ursula, in her inexperience, did not detect what was going on, and still fancied that the habit had been renounced. All she did know {{was that it was}} entirely useless for her to attempt to exert any authority over the valet, and {{that the only way to}} escape insolently polite disobedience was to let him alone. Moreover, plans to which her father had agreed, when broached by her, had often been overthrown after his valet had been with him. It was a life full of care and disappointment, yet there was a certain spring of trust that kept Ursula's youth from being dimmed, and enabled her to get a fair share of happiness out of it, though she was very sorry not to be more at Bridgefield, where she could have worked with all her heart with May Condamine. Moreover, Lady Kirkaldy's absence from London was a great loss to her, for there was no one who was so kind or so available in taking her into society; and Nuttie, though mistress of her father's house, was not yet twenty-two, and strongly felt that she must keep within careful bounds, and not attempt to be her own chaperon.|$|E

30|$|The Syrian crisis {{gained a}} new and more complex {{character}} following the incursions of IS, culminating in summer 2014, targeting non-Sunnite and particularly the ancient Christian and Yazidi populations in the region. Hence, starting with summer 2014, Turkey has faced a more complex mass movement of people toward its borders, who are not necessarily of an ethnic and religious character that the AKP establishment has so far felt itself at ease with. Although in some instances these people can have access to camps, media reports from the region show they <b>feel</b> themselves <b>more</b> <b>secure</b> in the hands of mostly Kurdish-led HDP (Peoples’ Democracy Party) local governments in south-eastern Turkey as well as their communities. Thereby, the handling of non-Sunnite, non-Arab and non-Syrian refugees has become a litmus test for Turkish refugee regime and humanitarian diplomacy. In order to understand the implications of selective humanitarianism, I will now examine the treatment that different refugees have experienced in Turkey.|$|R

30|$|Bertrand Russell {{presented}} a particularly witty, pungent {{variation of the}} problem. Think of an American turkey that is fed every day. At each meal its conviction is consolidated {{that one of the}} general rules of life is that it will be fed daily by friendly members of the human race who think only of its welfare. Its faith gains strength gradually as the number of meals administered to it grows, and each day the idea that it is in a friendly environment is corroborated. As the days pass and its death grows nearer and nearer, the turkey <b>feels</b> <b>more</b> and <b>more</b> <b>secure.</b> Its sense of security, therefore, reaches a maximum just at the moment when risk becomes greatest. This is the trouble and the pdoxical aspect of induction: learning backwards, trusting in the uniformity of the course of nature and experience, and in the impossibility of a radical change. Then, however, in view of Thanksgiving, the turkey experiences something totally unexpected: it is strangled in order to be cooked.|$|R
