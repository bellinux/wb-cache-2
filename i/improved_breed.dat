There were half a dozen more cows on board, as well as an <b>improved</b> <b>breed</b> of hogs. Mark carried out, also, a couple of mares, for, while many horses could never be much needed in his islands, a few would always be exceedingly useful. Oxen were much wanted, but one of his new colonists had yoked his cows, and it was thought they might be made useful, in a moderate degree, until their stouter substitutes could be reared. Carts and wagons were provided in sufficient numbers. A good stock of iron in bars was laid in, in addition to that which was wrought into nails, and other useful articles. Several thousand dollars in coin were also provided, being principally in small pieces, including copper. But all the emigrants took more or less specie with them.|$|E

The backers of the latter have the satisfaction of knowing, however, that the whole affair has been characterised by extreme fairness. The pigeons were confined in a specially invented trap, which could only be opened by the spring. It was thus possible to feed them through an aperture in the top, but any tampering with their wings was quite out of the question. A few such matches would go far towards popularising pigeon-flying in America, and form an agreeable variety to the morbid exhibitions of human endurance which have assumed such proportions during the last few years." ...|$|E
60|$|It is {{not that}} spring is early there; on the contrary, it is {{actually}} later by many days than in the surrounding country. It is flowerless at a time when, outside the forest, on southern banks and by the hedge-side, in coppices and all sheltered spots, the firstlings of the year are seen--purple and white and yellow. The woods, which are composed almost entirely of beech and oak, are leafless. The aspect on a dull cold day is somewhat cheerless. On the other hand, there is that largeness and wildness which accord with the spring mood; and {{there are signs of}} the coming change even in the greyest weather. Standing in some wide green drive or other open space, you see all about you acres on acres, miles on miles, of majestic beeches, and their upper branches and network of terminal twigs, that look at a distance like heavy banked-up clouds, are dusky red and purple with the renewed life that is surging in them. There are jubilant cries of wild creatures that have felt the seasonal change far more keenly than we are able to feel it. Above everything, we find here that solitariness and absence of human interest now so rare in England. For albeit social creatures in the main, we are yet all of us at times hermits in heart, if not exactly wild men of the woods; and that solitude which we create by shutting ourselves from the world in a room or a house, is but a poor substitute--nay, a sham: it is to immure ourselves in a cage, a prison, which hardly serves to keep out the all-pervading atmosphere of miserable conventions, and cannot refresh and invigorate us. There are seasons and moods when even the New Forest does not seem sufficiently remote from life: in its most secluded places one is always liable to encounter a human being, an old resident, going about in the exercise of his commoner's rights; or else his ponies or cows or swine. These last, if they be not of some <b>improved</b> <b>breed,</b> may have a novel or quaint aspect, as of wild creatures, but the appearance is deceptive; as you pass they lift their long snouts from grubbing among the dead leaves to salute you with a too familiar grunt--an assurance that William Rufus is dead, and all is well; that they are domestic, and will spend their last days in a stye, and end their life respectably {{at the hands of the}} butcher.|$|E

40|$|Dairy {{sector is}} the most {{important}} of all livestock sub sectors and it has great impact on the rural economy. The domestic milk production only constitutes about 26 percent of the country's requirement. A field survey was conducted to find out the performance of Mahintha Chinthana's dairy village cattle breeds compare to local cattle breeds in Batticaloa District Hundred and fifty dairy village farmers were selected from IS dairy villages in the Batticaloa district. Data were collected through a pre-tested structured questionnaire on socio economic condition, details of dairy cattle, management practices, problems faced by the dairy farmers and extension services. Fifty six percent of the dairy village farmers were small holders and 35 % were medium size holders. Almost 42 % of the respondents practiced fully intensive rearing system while 39 % were adopting tethering system for improved cattle breeds; in case of local breeds those were 5 % and 29 % respectively. But 62 % were adopting semi intensive system. Enough concentrates were given for <b>improved</b> <b>breeds</b> and local breeds were only 49 % and 5 % respectively. Average milk production was 1. 29 1 /animal/day from <b>improved</b> <b>breeds</b> and 4. 25 1 /animal/day from local breeds. Nearly 12 % of the farmers have been newly adopted to pasture and fodder production. Constraints reported by the farmers were high cost for concentrate feeds, low price for milk, lack of grasses and grass land, and lack of credit facilities. The study concluded that the management systems were very poor for Mahintha Chinthana's <b>improved</b> <b>breeds</b> in some aspects such as rearing system and feeding practices.

Breeders began with white German Spitz dogs, originally brought over from northeastern China to Japan; they were first exhibited at a dog show in Tokyo in 1921. Between 1925 and 1936 various small white Spitz breeds were imported from around the world and crossed into the developing breed, with the goal of producing an <b>improved</b> <b>breed.</b> The final Standard for the breed was written after World War II, and accepted by the Japan Kennel Club. The breed gained popularity in Japan in the 1950s, and was exported to Sweden in the early 1950s. From there the breed went to England, and the Kennel Club recognized the Japanese Spitz in 1977 in the Utility Group. The Japanese Spitz has spread around the world including to India, Australia, and the United States and is recognized by most of the major kennel clubs in the English speaking world; by the Canadian Kennel Club in Group 6, Non-Sporting, by the New Zealand Kennel Club (Non-Sporting Group), by the Australian National Kennel Council in Group 7 (Non Sporting), and by the United Kennel Club (U.S.) in the Northern Breeds Group. The American Kennel Club does not recognize the Japanese Spitz due to its being close in appearance to a U.S. developed Spitz breed, the American Eskimo Dog.
