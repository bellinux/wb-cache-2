500|$|Eliot's poems have {{frequently}} been examined for instances of anti-Semitism—prejudice or discrimination against Jews. Scholar Louis Menand states that while Simeon is treated respectfully by Eliot, his characterisation is [...] "in {{the tradition of}} Christian condescension toward the virtuous heathen". [...] Comparatively, Craig Raine, a poet and an Emeritus Fellow of New College, Oxford, wrote a book-length defence of Eliot against the claims of deliberate anti-Semitism and argues that [...] "A Song for Simeon" [...] provides a sympathetic discussion of the Jewish diaspora. University of British Columbia scholar John Xiros Cooper states that the accusations of anti-Semitism lodged against Eliot rest [...] "on a few isolated lines of poetry" [...] and a passing reference in one prose text. Indeed, Eliot denied the claim, declaring, [...] "I am not an anti-Semite and never have been. It is a terrible slander on a man." [...] Political theorist and author Leonard Woolf, who was both Jewish and one of Eliot's close friends, believed that Eliot was [...] "slightly anti-Semitic <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> vague way which is not uncommon.

500|$|In {{terms of}} regular nuclear testing, Kittens {{represents}} bomb component testing, while Tims and Rats were early subcritical hydronuclear tests. [...] Vixen is [...] "safety testing" [...] of a bomb; assuring {{that the core}} would not accidentally undergo criticality {{in the event of}} a fire or unintended crash. These are always messy (see the US equivalent at Plutonium Valley in Project 56), for a successful test subjects the core fuel to high explosives in the hope that it simply scatters rather than undergoes criticality. The differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> dangers presented by major vs the minor tests is that there was no critical explosion in the minor tests. [...] In the major tests, the bomb cores reached critical mass; the plutonium or uranium fissile materials [...] "burned" [...] into highly radioactive fission products, and those, along with the unspent fuel and activated bomb case, tower and soil if the explosion was close to the ground, are lofted into the stratosphere to be dropped eventually as fallout globally. In Vixen, an equivalent amount of plutonium fuel was simply smashed by explosives and spread about much more locally. [...] In Kittens, Tims and Rats, smaller amounts of various materials were similar exploded locally and spread about.|$|E

40|$|AbstractClathrin and {{adaptors}} are {{components of}} clathrin-coated pits and vesicles.

The clathrin forms a polyhedral lattice and {{is believed to be}} the driving force behind membrane invagination leading to vesicle budding.

Clarkson explains that the video is a departure from her previous videos in that she is [...] "completely glammed out. It's the opposite of my everyday life." [...] The video begins with Clarkson alone in an apartment wearing a gold gown, sequined elbow gloves, and a large pearl necklace, while lying on a chaise longue. This scene alternates with a second location, where Clarkson wears a black dress, singing in a rehearsal room, surrounded by invisible members of an orchestra playing their instruments.

Michael Azerrad called it [...] "superb" [...] in Rolling Stone, while Daniel Fidler from Spin viewed the record as [...] "a clean move toward musical excellence", showing the Afghan Whigs [...] "bursting its Sub Pop chains with catchy, heavy guitar riffs, downright lovable song arrangements, melodies that jerk your emotions back and forth, and yes, endearing, raspy vocals that wail, moan, scream, and shout". Brad Webber of the Chicago Tribune found the album {{more accessible to}} listeners than contemporary Seattle or Minneapolis-based, guitar-oriented grunge bands, writing that the Afghan Whigs were [...] "on rock's cutting edge" [...] while stirring [...] "a torrent of emotions on neatly paced songs". In Musician magazine, J. D.

[...] Considine concluded in his review, [...] "The best reason to join this Congregation is that the songs are catchy enough to hold their own against the best work of bands like Dinosaur Jr. or the Replacements." [...] Option was less impressed, appreciating the record's [...] "sheer listenability", [...] "clear recording and dynamic performances", but criticizing Dulli's lyrics and the band's cover of [...] "The Temple".
