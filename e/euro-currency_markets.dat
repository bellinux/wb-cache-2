40|$|The <b>Euro-currency</b> <b>markets</b> have {{expanded}} very rapidly since 1966. This rapid development has drawn the attention {{not only of}} those who are responsible for monetary policy, but also of economists who are by no means in agreement concerning what takes place on the market for Euro-loans. The present work analyses the Euro-market in order to draw some concrete conclusions. A description of the Euro-dollar market is provided and analogies at the national level are made. The author then considers the effect of the Euro-dollar market on the volume of credit before looking at the American balance of payments and Euro-dollar loans. Finally, the determination of interest rates on the Euro-dollar market is examined as well as the issue of control. JEL: E 44, E 51, E 52 </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{overseas}} {{assets and}} liabilities of UK banks account for over 50 % of the overseas {{assets and liabilities}} of all UK residents and almost 50 % of UK banks' total assets and liabilities. They are {{much larger than the}} overseas assets of banks in other developed countries. This paper adopts an institutional, theoretical and empirical approach to explain the large size of these overseas assets. We find that over 80 % of these assets and liabilities are accounted for by foreign-owned UK banks and their large size may be traced {{to the development of the}} <b>Euro-currency</b> <b>markets</b> in London in the late 1950 s and 1960 s. Although net overseas bank assets can, in principle, be explained, the gross assets are more problematic. The theoretical literature is quite limited and the most appropriate macroeconomic framework would be complex and difficult to apply. We therefore examine some simpler empirical hypotheses about the size of these assets and liabilities but find that they are rejected by the data. We conclude that while an institutional and theoretical approach reveals the nature of UK banks' overseas assets and liabilities and suggests some of their determinants, developing a satisfactory empirical model is quite difficult.

40|$|Luxembourg {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{successful}} financial centers in the world. Initially associated with international syndicated loans, euro-bonds and <b>euro-currency</b> <b>markets,</b> Luxembourg has developed as a center for private banking and is currently the second largest center for the domiciliation of investment funds in the world after the US - with a portfolio equivalent to about sixty times the country’s GDP -, and the first captive reinsurance market in the European Union. As in many other financial centers, the interbank market plays an important role. This partly reflects intra-group operations of foreign banks using their Luxembourg branches and subsidiaries to adjust their liquidity position. More generally, Luxembourg has attracted foreign banks seeking to benefit from its favorable regulatory framework, political stability, language skills of the local workforce and the agglomeration of specialized skills in accounting and legal services. The importance of the financial sector in Luxembourg implies that a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model with explicit modeling of the financial sector is indispensable in order to properly take into account the interaction between the financial and the real sector in the economy and the interconnectedness between different financial institutional sectors (e. g. commercial banks and investment funds). Explicit modeling of the financial sector also allows for an analysis of how the economy might respond to financial shocks. This dissertation contributes to the literature by developing two analytical tools: 1. en Sciences économiques et de gestioninfo:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|E
40|$|The inflationary {{implications}} of the <b>Euro-currency</b> <b>market</b> {{continue to be a}} source of contention and misunderstanding. One view on the matter is that the market, having some potential for net credit creation, adds dangerously to the rate of world credit expansion. As a challenge to this view, there are others who caution that the case for joint action is not yet well-founded. The author sides with the latter argument, arguing that considerable evidence can be found to show that the growth of the <b>Euro-currency</b> <b>market</b> represents to a significant extent a substitution for, rather than an addition to, credit expansion in other forms. Euro-currency credits appear to be substitutes for four alternative types of accommodation: domestic credit to non-banks, domestic “monetary base” creation, foreign money markets and forward exchange markets.   JEL: E 31, E 44, E 51 </p...|$|R

In the interest of international monetary stability this market should now move somewhat away from {{the centre of the}} stage and leave the main responsibility for the recycling of oil funds to the official financing mechanisms...|$|R

One of her first articles, The Growth of Multinational Banking, the <b>Euro-currency</b> <b>market</b> and their effects on developing countries in the Journal of Development Studies, published in 1980, warned of the risk of excessive international bank lending to developing economies.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is analyse the factors that {{influence}} conditions in the <b>Euro-currency</b> <b>market,</b> focusing separately on demand and supply factors. The paper tentatively concludes that the main reasons for the present borrowers' market seem to be, first, the turn-round in the US current account, from a large surplus in 1974 - 76 to an equally large deficit in 1977 - 78 and, second, a much narrower (or even reversed) interest rate spread in the US financial market. The increased aggressiveness of the banks in their external lending activity seems to have amplified the squeezes on margins, but the effects of the outside factors seem more important than this "endogenous" factor. ...|$|R
40|$|State countercyclical {{financial}} interventionism {{is conceived}} {{here as a}} permanenet intervention of a state into the economy of a country by means of financial instruments directed at preventing economic fluctuations. In a market economy financial instruments are easier to assimilate than administrative and regulative instruments. The Italian State tries to improve the economic balance of the country by manipulating the financial flows. Thus it prevents business fluctuations of national economy. The possibilities of the State exerting influence on {{the economy of the}} country depend on social and economic doctrines adopted by the governing elites and on institutional and administrative infrastructure. In the article the Italian economy has been divided into two basic markets: money and short-term credit market and capital and long-term credit market. The policy of direct refinancing, the regulation of obligatory reserve, the policy of open market and the control of foreign financial relations have been analyzed. The analyses of empirical data justifies the conclusion that financial instruments at the State disposal played small role in moderating the business fluctuations of national economy. Competition among banks, internationalization of bank systems, widening the specialization of banks, the emergence of <b>Euro-currency</b> <b>market</b> are among the most important factors reducing the effectiveness of the State financial policy aimed at preventing business fluctuations of economy. Such a policy is more efficient in times of economic expansion than during depression. The article ends with conclusions concerning the possibilities of employing financial instruments in future, reformed Polish economy.
