500|$|On the cap {{undersurface}} are the pores, {{which are}} angular to elongated and measure about 2mm wide. The {{color of the}} pore surface is pinkish brown to tan or buff, but it becomes yellowish brown in maturity; bruised areas turn ochre-tawny. The tubes are somewhat decurrent attached to the stipe (i.e., running slightly down its length), and extend about [...] deep. The mushroom lacks any appreciable odor or taste. The <b>dry,</b> <b>solid</b> stipe measures [...] long by [...] thick, and is nearly equal in thickness throughout, or slightly tapered on either end.

500|$|Initially {{pale yellow}} to yellow, the pore surface {{develops}} olive tinges as it matures, and often becomes depressed near the stem attachment. Pores are circular to angular, and minute—typically less than 1mm wide; the tubes are [...] deep. The golden-yellow stem is [...] long by [...] thick. Young stems are typically bulbous to club-shaped, but this evens out somewhat as the mushroom grows, and mature stems are club-shaped to nearly equal in width throughout. The stem is <b>dry,</b> <b>solid</b> (i.e., not hollow), and features yellow reticulation, {{at least on}} the upper portion. Mycelia {{at the base of the}} stem have a buff color.

500|$|The stipe {{is white}} to pale yellow, <b>dry,</b> <b>solid,</b> not bruising, and [...] (having {{a very fine}} whitish powder on the surface). A {{characteristic}} feature of many Suillus species are the glandular dots found on the stipe—clumps of hyphal cell ends through which the fungus secretes various metabolic wastes, leaving a sticky or resinous [...] "dot". In S.brevipes, {{the form of the}} glandular dots is variable: they may be absent, slightly underdeveloped or obscurely formed with age. The stipe is usually short in comparison to the diameter of the cap, typically [...] long and [...] thick. It is either of equal width throughout, or may taper downwards; its surface bears minute puncture holes at maturity, and is it slightly fibrous at the base. Collections made in New Zealand tend to have a reddish coloration at the very base of the stipe. The flesh of the mushroom is initially white, but turns pale yellow in age. The odor and taste are mild. [...] The spore print is cinnamon-brown.|$|E
500|$|The cap of L.fallax is [...] wide, {{ranging in}} shape from convex to nearly flat {{with a small}} umbo, {{expanding}} to plane or becoming shallowly depressed, {{with or without the}} umbo. The margin (cap edge) is even or scalloped. The cap surface is dry and velvety, finely wrinkled over the center, azonate (without concentric lines), and dark sooty brown to blackish. The gills are attached to subdecurrent (running shortly {{down the length of the}} stem), narrow, crowded, not forked, white at first, and become creamy buff with age. The edges of the gills are brown like the cap, and slowly stain vinaceous (redwine-colored) when bruised. There are several tiers of lamellulae (short gills that do not reach the stem) interspersed among the full-length gills. The stem is [...] long, [...] thick, nearly equal in width throughout, <b>dry,</b> <b>solid,</b> unpolished or velvety, and a paler brown than the cap. The flesh is thin, brittle, staining pale vinaceous. The odor is not distinctive, and the taste mild or faintly acrid. The latex is , white on exposure, unchanging, slowly staining flesh and gills vinaceous. The spore print is yellowish. The edibility of the mushroom has not been officially documented.

40|$|This study aims to {{characterize}} anaerobically digested sludge (ADS) and correlate the sludge characteristics {{in terms of}} soluble organic compounds with polymer demand (PD) during sludge conditioning. The PD required to achieve maximum dewatering of the ADS studied is {{in the range of}} 8 - 10 kg polymer/dry ton. The commonly used capillary suction time parameter to evaluate the solid-liquid separation ability was not a reliable indicator for assessing dewatering. Instead, in this study, a modified centrifugal technique proposed by Higgins (Higgins MCT) was used to assess the maximum achievable <b>dry</b> <b>solids</b> content of the biosolids cake. The Higgins MCT is readily obtained using a bench-scale centrifuge equipped with a modified centrifuge bucket. Using the Higgins MCT, the maximum <b>dry</b> <b>solids</b> contents obtained from conditioned ADS was 30 wt%.

40|$|Instant noodle was {{prepared}} {{in a commercial}} noodle plant using varying steaming and frying conditions. Wheat flour had very low amount of resistant starch (RS) as 0. 26 g/ 100 g <b>dry</b> <b>solids.</b> Dough was formed by mixing wheat flour with other adjuncts for 15 - 20 min, cut into about 0. 5 mm strands and steamed in a tunnel for 90 to 240 s.

40|$|A {{model to}} solve heat and mass {{balances}} during the offdesign load calculations was created. These equations {{are complex and}} nonlinear. The main new ideas used in the created offdesign model of a kraft recovery boiler are the use of heat flows as torn iteration variables instead of the current practice of using the mass flows, vectorizing equation solving, thus speeding up the process, using non dimensional variables for solving the multiple heat transfer surface problem and using a new procedure for calculating pressure losses. Recovery boiler heat and mass balances are reduced to vector form. It is shown that these vectorized equations can be solved virtually without iteration. The iteration speed is enhanced {{by the use of}} the derived method of calculating multiple heat transfer surfaces simultaneously. To achieve this quick convergence the heat flows were used as the torn iteration parameters. A new method to handle pressure loss calculations with linearization was presented. This method enabled less time to be spent calculating pressure losses. The derived vector representation of the steam generator was used to calculate offdesign operation parameters for a 3000 tds/d example recovery boiler. The model was used to study recovery boiler part load operation and the effect of the black liquor <b>dry</b> <b>solids</b> increase on recovery boiler dimensioning. Heat flows to surface elements for part load calculations can be closely approximated with a previously defined exponent function. The exponential method can be used for the prediction of fouling in kraft recovery boilers. For similar furnaces the firing of 80 % <b>dry</b> <b>solids</b> liquor produces lower hearth heat release rate than the 65 % <b>dry</b> <b>solids</b> liquor if we fire at constant steam flow. The furnace outlet temperatures show that capacity increase with firing rate increase produces higher loadings than capacity increase with <b>dry</b> <b>solids</b> increase. The economizers, boiler banks and furnaces can be dimensioned smaller if we increase the black liquor <b>dry</b> <b>solids</b> content. The main problem with increased black liquor <b>dry</b> <b>solids</b> content is the decrease in the heat available to superheat. Whenever possible the furnace exit temperature should be increased by decreasing the furnace height. The increase in the furnace exit temperature is usually opposed because of fear of increased corrosion...|$|R
