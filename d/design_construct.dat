The Nest, a dedicated maker-space which was opened in March 2017, allows students to <b>design,</b> <b>construct</b> or modify meaningful or handy items with specialised tools in the lab, and supports the school's Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Applied Learning Programme (STEM ALP).|$|E
5|$|Nan Chiau High School commemorated its 70th {{anniversary in}} 2017 along with Nan Chiau Primary School (its former {{ancillary}} primary section before 2001). On 27 January 2017, {{a total of}} 3,398 staff and students both institutions came together to craft knots on a triple-ring with red strings, which resembles the school logo. The event set a national record for the most people making knotted rings together. A dedicated maker-space was also opened on 10 March 2017. Named The Nest, the tools equipped space allow students to <b>design,</b> <b>construct</b> or modify meaningful or handy items in their own accord.|$|E

25|$|Earthquake {{engineering}} involves designing {{structures to}} withstand hazardous earthquake exposures. Earthquake engineering is a sub-discipline of structural engineering.

25|$|In May 1951, both Lockheed and Convair {{were awarded}} {{contracts}} {{in the attempt}} to <b>design,</b> <b>construct,</b> and test two experimental VTOL fighters. Lockheed produced the XFV, and Convair producing the Convair XFY Pogo. Both experimental programs proceeded to flight status and completed test flights 1954–1955, when the contracts were cancelled. Similarly, the X-13 flew a series of test flights between 1955 and 1957, but also suffered the same fate.|$|E

25|$|Transport Canada made {{a request}} for {{proposal}} for an airport rail link in April 2001. In May 2003, the submissions were pared down to four pre-qualified private consortia, who were then invited to submit business cases. An SNC-Lavalin subsidiary named the Union Pearson AirLink Group {{was selected as the}} successful respondent to finance, <b>design,</b> <b>construct,</b> operate and maintain an airport rail link on November 13, 2003. The service was to be called Blue22, as a trip would take 22 minutes to or from Pearson with a stop at the Bloor GO/Dundas West TTC Station. Trains were to be refurbished Budd Rail Diesel Cars, and were expected to begin running between 2008 and 2010.|$|E
25|$|The Golden Gate Bridge and Highway District, {{authorized}} by {{an act of}} the California Legislature, was incorporated in 1928 as the official entity to <b>design,</b> <b>construct,</b> and finance the Golden Gate Bridge. However, after the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the District was unable to raise the construction funds, so it lobbied for a $30million bond measure. The bonds were approved in November 1930, by votes in the counties affected by the bridge. The construction budget at the time of approval was $27million. However, the District was unable to sell the bonds until 1932, when Amadeo Giannini, the founder of San Francisco–based Bank of America, agreed on behalf of his bank to buy the entire issue in order to help the local economy.|$|E

To build the demonstrators, Ben Rich had to raise $10.4million from the Lockheed management, which was secured by June. Phase 2 {{encompassed}} three main objectives, which were the validation of: reduced visibility in the radio wave, infrared, and visual spectrums and reduced acoustical observability; acceptable flying qualities; and the [...] "modeling capabilities that accurately predict low observable characteristics of an aircraft in flight".|$|E

2500|$|The {{traditional}} tail vise uses {{one large}} screw, either wooden or metal. It {{is made in}} the form of a frame, with the back part of the frame fitting under the bench, and the movement of that frame located and restrained by a [...] complex system of sliding tongues and grooves, and runners, such that smooth left and right movements of the frame are possible, but forward and backward movements, or rotative movements of the frame are impossible. The jaw has a face that contacts the bench top, and it has one or more dog holes on the top—often 3 to 4, each spaced 5 inches apart—that are in line with the dog holes located on the front face (apron) of the bench—numerous holes, each also spaced 5 inches apart. This is the least expensive option for a tail vise, but it is by far the most complex to <b>design,</b> <b>construct</b> and maintain. Tage Frid and Frank Klausz popularized this type of tail vise in North America, although its origin dates back to northern Europe (most probably Germany) in the 18th century.|$|E
2500|$|... "This {{monument}} {{symbolizes the}} pinnacle of successful {{for the construction of}} the North–South Expressway that connects Bukit Kayu Hitam bordering with Thailand in the North to Johor Bahru in the Causeway bordering with Singapore in the South. The construction of the 848km expressway, across the peat swamps and forests and hill untapped granite hills, is an amazing achievement. Also impressive is the pragmatic way in which the combined efforts between {{the public and private sectors}} has resulted in this achievement. The expressways is the result of joint efforts of the Malaysian Highway Authority, a statutory body, which has been planned early and begin construction, with the Projek Lebuhraya Utara-Selatan Berhad (PLUS) (North–South Expressway Project), a private company that was awarded concessions to finance, <b>design,</b> <b>construct,</b> operate and maintain the expressways. Such efforts shows an improvement visions into a reality after across a variety of challenges that threaten to stop. It acknowledged the success of the Government and represents a national effort funded and operated successfully by Malaysians. This monument also commemorates the efforts of leaders of the Government, public services, businesses, financial institutions, consultants, engineers and consultants, as well as contractors and labours, which has played an important role in facing their challenges and bring this project to a level of success. Those who use this expressway will be expected not only to enjoy the various parties in the construction efforts, but also can even appreciate this expressway contribution towards national development." ...|$|E

No such framework has been available in the literature that estimates software reliability of OO design by taking complexity into consideration. The framework bridges the gap between object oriented <b>design</b> <b>constructs,</b> complexity and reliability. Framework measures and minimizes the complexity of software design at the early stage of software development life cycle leading to a reliable end product. Reliability and complexity estimation models have been proposed by following the proposed framework.
