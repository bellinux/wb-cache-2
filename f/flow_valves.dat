50|$|T-Stoff: High test {{peroxide}} equipment {{consists of}} a pipe which runs along the starboard beam of the lifting frame from the trunnion end to the halfway point. The pipe is fitted at the upper end to the triple valve assembly, consisting of two <b>flow</b> <b>valves</b> and a three-way valve.

The measuring tank can be filled to the rocket's required amount of T-stoff, after which any excess flows down a stand pipe to the overflow tank. The measuring tank is fitted with a ventilation stud, which vents displaced air as the tank is filled. The ventilation stud includes a ball cock fixed to a frustum stopper, which blocks the vent stud in case of accidental overfilling so that T-Stoff does not spray from the air vent.

The results show that the pilot pressure drop – pilot spool opening compensation method is feasible, and the proposed proportional flow control valve with this compensation method has a good static and dynamic performance...|$|E

The <b>flow</b> <b>valve</b> opens to a pre-designed opening to open the shut-off valve between the standpipe and the information drop unit. When the signal reception short reaches the underground predetermined depth, the mud pump is turned on to establish the circulation condition. After the mud pump is stable, save the pump pressure to maintain a certain pump pressure, and then, use the computer control information to realize the different time intervals, the preset pressure pulse signal is sent out. The signal receiving short section receives the pulse signal from the ground pressure in the well bottom and stores it. According to the test results, {{it can be seen}} that the increase of the <b>flow</b> <b>valve</b> opening and the increase of the pump pressure have obvious improvement on the information transmission. The deeper the depth of field, the greater the impact on information delivery.

The system layout incorporates a prime mover, a variable displacement pump, several <b>flow</b> <b>valves</b> and motors representing different loads on the powertrain. A gain-scheduled ∞H controller [14] was successfully developed and tested on a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) system. However, previous results were for relatively simple reference tracking tasks. In this paper, the previously developed systems and load emulation environments are implemented and used to provide a test environment for the human-centered evaluation of powertrain controller designs. Measures for performance and efficiency are first discussed and defined for the earthmoving powertrain. The ∞H control problem is then presented along with a brief summary of the Earthmoving Vehicle Powertrain Simulator (EVPS) plant model developed previously. Various design plant models (DPMs), based on maximizing performance and/or efficiency, are described and controllers are synthesized using commonly available ∞H control design software. Experimental comparisons of working cycle times, tracking performance, system efficiencies, and component efficiencies are made between the different controller designs. The task used for comparison is a 180 -degree closed-loop working cycle for a medium sized wheel loader. I...|$|E
