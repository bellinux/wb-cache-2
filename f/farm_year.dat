Also, weight records of 22, 778 animals born from 1998 to 2003, in ten farms across six Brazilian states were used. Carcass traits as measured by ultrasound of the live animal were recorded from 2002 to 2004 in 2590 males and females with ages varying from 450 to 599 days. Fixed models including <b>farm,</b> <b>year</b> and season of birth, sex and type of feed effects, and the covariates age of dam (AOD) and age of animal at measurement were used to study the effect of environmental factors on these traits. The genetic parameters for LMA, BF and RF were estimated with two and three-trait animal models with 120 -day weights using a restricted maximum likelihood method. All environmental effects significantly affected carcass traits, with the exception of year of birth for BF and RF and AOD for LMA. The heritability estimates for LMA, BF and RF were 0. 35, 0. 51 and 0. 39, respectively. Standard errors obtained in one-trait analyses were from 0. 07 to 0. 09. Genetic correlation estimates between LMA and the two traits of subcutaneous fat were low (close to zero) and 0. 74 between BF and RF, indicating that the selection for LMA should not cause antagonism in the genetic improvement of subcutaneous fat measured by real-time ultrasound.

The aim of this retrospective {{study was to investigate}} the predictive value of endometrial microbiology and cytology by relating results to per-cycle pregnancy rates in a UK Thoroughbred population over eight consequent breeding seasons. We also aimed to identify any changes in microbial prevalence over this speriod. We first examined the relationship between bacteriological and cytological classification. A multiple logistic regression was then performed to investigate the predictive value of these indices of endometritis for pregnancy. The influence of mare age and status (barren, maiden, foaling), stud <b>farm,</b> <b>year</b> in which the results were obtained, and treatment of presumed infections on subsequent endometrial status and pregnancy were also investigated. Endometrial swabs (n= 8752) were collected via the external cervical os from 2398 Thoroughbred mares during the breeding seasons of 2006 - 2013. Status, age, intra-uterine treatment and establishment of pregnancy were recorded for all mares for each swab. 25. 8 % of all swabs were positive for microbial culture, whereas only 8. 2 % of mares were positive for inflammatory cells via cytology. 5. 7 % of mares were positive on both culture and cytology. Beta-haemolytic Streptococcus, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were the most frequently cultured organisms. Relative organism prevalence did not change significantly over the years examined (P> 0. 05). Culture and cytological results were well related according to the Chi squared test (P< 0. 05), but not according to McNemar’s test (P< 0. 05). Chi-Squared tests were performed to examine the influence of each factor on pregnancy rates; a factor was entered into the logistic regression model if P< 0. 10. All factors (year, stud farm, mare age, mare status, bacteriology result, cytology result, and treatment) were included. In the logistic regression model, treatment was of the least influence on conception rates, followed by cytological status. All other factors had a significant relationship with pregnancy rates. However, type of pathogen and grade of cytology were not accounted for in this model. In conclusion, this study shows that simple positive or negative microbiology or cytology on an endometrial swab are not enough to determine the chances of a mare conceiving. Grade of growth and inflammation, type of pathogen and mare age and status must be taken into account, as well as clinical findings and stallion and management factors...|$|E

It is not known whether using sensor systems also improves measures of health and production in dairy herds.

Data of 414 Dutch dairy farms with (n =  152) and without (n =  262) sensor systems were available. For these herds, information on milk production per cow, days to first service, first calving age, and somatic cell count (SCC) was provided for the years 2003 to 2013. Moreover, year of investment in sensor systems was available. For every <b>farm</b> <b>year,</b> we determined whether that year was before or after the year of investment in sensor systems on farms with an automatic milking system (AMS) or a conventional milking system (CMS), or whether it was a year on a farm that never invested in sensor systems. Separate statistical analyses were performed to determine the effect of sensor systems for mastitis detection (color, SCC, electrical conductivity, and lactate dehydrogenase sensors), estrus detection for dairy cows, estrus detection for young stock, and other sensor systems (weighing platform, rumination time sensor, fat and protein sensor, temperature sensor, milk temperature sensor, urea sensor, β-hydroxybutyrate sensor, and other sensor systems). The AMS farms had a higher average SCC (by 12, 000  cells/mL) after sensor investment, and CMS farms with a mastitis detection system had a lower average SCC (by 10, 000  cells/mL) in the years after sensor investment. Having sensor systems was associated with a higher average production per cow on AMS farms, and with a lower average production per cow on CMS farms in the years after investment. The most likely reason for this lower milk production after investment was that on 96 % of CMS farms, the sensor system investment occurred together with another major change at the farm, such as a new barn or a new milking system. Most likely, these other changes had led to a decrease in milk production that could not be compensated for by the use of sensor systems. Having estrus detection sensor systems did not improve reproduction performance. Labor reduction was an important reason for investing in sensor systems. Therefore, economic benefits from investments in sensor systems can be expected more from the reduction in labor costs than from improvements in measures of health and production in dairy herds...|$|E

Factors {{affecting}} {{the incidence of}} postpartum oestrus, ovarian activity and reproductive performance in Thoroughbred mares bred at foal heat under Indian subtropical conditions. ? Theriogenology, 74, (1), 90 - 99. IMPF: 02. 04 Decreased reproductive performance due to summer stress is a well known phenomenon in farm livestock. Whether this occurs in the mare and specifically how this might affect postpartum reproductive activity and performance, especially at Foal Heat (FH), is unknown. This study, therefore, aims to investigate this and the factors that might affect postpartum reproductive activity. Reproductive records of 228 Thoroughbred mares (694 mare years) bred in subtropical north-western India were retrospectively analysed. Overt oestrous activity occurred within 21 d postpartum in 92. 94 % (645 / 694) of mares. Significantly (p < 0. 001) more April foaling mares (97. 37 %, 185 / 190) expressed postpartum oestrous activity than those foaling in January (83. 61 %; 51 / 61) and February (88. 49; 123 / 139). Similarly significantly (p < 0. 01) fewer multiparous mares failed to demonstrate oestrous activity than primiparous mares (6. 12 % vs. 15. 07 %; 38 / 621 vs. 11 / 73, respectively). 190 of these 694 mares were additionally monitored to confirm ovulation; in these mares onset of FH (oestrus plus confirmed ovulation) occurred 8. 42 ? 0. 17 d and first ovulation 13. 64 ? 0. 20 d postpartum. Month, stud <b>farm,</b> <b>year,</b> and parity did not affect interval from parturition to FH onset or to first ovulation; or FH onset to ovulation. In FH bred mares Day 16 pregnancy rate and overall foaling rate were 53. 76 % (100 / 186) and 46. 24 % (86 / 186) respectively and {{were similar to those}} of mares bred later postpartum. FH pregnancy rates were not affected by stud, season, month, year, number of matings, or day of ovulation but were significantly (p < 0. 008) lowered by increasing mare age. Significantly (p < 0. 01) lower Day 16 pregnancy rates were observed in uterine treated mares compared to untreated mares (31. 09 % vs. 57. 96 %; 9 / 29 vs. 91 / 157, respectively), this difference was not evident during the rest of pregnancy. In conclusion, postpartum reproductive and ovarian activity appears to be affected by environment, i. e., delayed in subtropical kept Thoroughbred mares compared to those kept in temperate climates.

With {{the objective}} of estimate genetic parameters and study the utilization of different effects on the genetic evolution for {{the age of the}} first calving (AFC) by different models, they were used AFC records from Nellore breed animals, born from 1990 to 2005. They were considered the following models (M) : M 1, including the fixed effect of the contemporary group (CG), CG 1 (grouping the animals that were born at the same farm and year), besides the co variable, weight at 365 days of age (linear and quadratic effects), totalizing 24, 263 records of AFC; M 2, considering the effects of CG 1, year and season of the calving, totalizing 59, 792 records of AFC and M 3, including effects CG 2 (grouping the animals born at the same <b>farm,</b> <b>year</b> and submitted at the same reproductive management), year and season of calving totalizing 59, 792 records of AFC. The components of variance and Genetic Value (GV) were obtained by Restricted Maximun Likelihood Method, with the inclusion for the relationship matrix. The Differences Expected on the Progeny (DEPs) were obtained by dividing the GV by two, after this they were estimated the correlations between GV and ranks of the reproductor's DEPs for AFC, utilizing the procedure CORR (SAS, 2003). While considering year and season of calving in the analysis models (M 2 and M 3), it was produced a bigger R&sup 2;, indicating that those models could explain, in a larger scale, the existing differences between the animals for AFC. The heritabilities estimated were of low magnitude (0, 14 and 0, 15). The correlations between the GV obtained by the different models were. 73 (M 1 x M 2);. 91 (M 2 x M 3) and. 66 (M 1 x M 3) ...|$|E
50|$|Originally {{known as}} Richland, {{a name that}} {{probably}} referred to the fertility of the soil, the Rosemark area was settled {{as early as the}} 1830s.
