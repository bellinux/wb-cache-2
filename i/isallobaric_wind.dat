40|$|The {{storm of}} the 28 of October 2013 {{was one of}} the strongest of the last 10 years, with wind gusts up to 152 km/h above the Wadden islands. In Meteorologica, a {{discussion}} started about the cause of the high winds experienced during this storm. With the help of Mode-S EHS aircraft data it is investigated to what extent the <b>isallobaric</b> <b>wind</b> has a large contribution to the total wind field. Mode-S EHS data, which is accumulated from an enhanced surveillance air traffic control radar that follows all the aircrafts in its range, contains information about the wind and the temperature. The quality of Mode-S EHS data is checked by a comparison with the Cabauw tower and the wind profiler at Cabauw. From this comparison, it is found that the quality of the Mode-S EHS data is good to use for further research. For the case study of the storm of the 28 of October 2013, the theoretical wind is determined with the finite difference method and with the piecewise linear interpolation method with the geopotential height from Harmonie 38 h 1. 2. With these two methods the geostrophic wind, the <b>isallobaric</b> <b>wind</b> and the inertial-advective component of the ageostrophic wind are determined. From this, it follows that the <b>isallobaric</b> <b>wind</b> and the inertial-advective component of the ageostrophic wind counteract each other {{near the center of the}} extratropical cyclone. It also shows that the modelled wind from Harmonie 38 compares well with the wind speed measured by Mode-S EHS and that the high winds were manifested in the lowest 800 m of the atmosphere...|$|E
40|$|The quasigeostrophic {{geopotential}} {{tendency equation}} is derived using P vectors in both pressure and entropy coordinates. This vector {{form of the}} geostrophic forcing in the geopotential tendency equation {{is similar to the}} Q-vector form of thew equation. It is shown that the horizontal components of Pare the advection of geostrophic momentum, and the vertical component of P is the horizontal temperature advection. The P vectors are shown to be related to Q and C vectors, as well as the ageostrophic circulation. The three-dimensional pseudocurl of the P vector gives the C vector that equals the ageostrophic pseudovorticity in the quasigeostrophic model. The horizontal components of the pseudocurl of P are perpendicular and proportional to the Q. The horizontal divergence of the P vector is the geostrophic absolute vorticity advection while the three-dimensional divergence of the P vector is the geostrophic quasigeostrophic potential vorticity advection. The ageostrophic wind can be partitioned into the P vector (geostrophic advective) and <b>isallobaric</b> <b>wind</b> contributions. A numerical simulation of an idealized cyclone is used to characterize the distribution of the P vectors and P-vector diagnostics in order to demonstrate their potential application to the diagnosis of synoptic-scale circulations. The distribution of the P vectors clearly indicates the advections of geostrophic momentum and temperature that characterize cyclogenesis. An examination of the P vectors and the <b>isallobaric</b> <b>wind</b> demonstrates that the P vectors provide insight into the ageostrophic circulation of the cyclone. Diagnoses of the three-dimensional P-vector divergence and curl are shown to produce useful depictions of cyclonic vortex spinup and the propagation of both the large- and smaller-scale features of the system. These diagnostics can be interpreted from a variety of perspectives, including the height tendency and the advection of quasigeostrophic potential vorticity [...] The use of P vectors to diagnose synoptic-scale circulations appears to provide potentially useful insights into the dynamics of synoptic-scale disturbances not readily obtained from other diagnoses...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to the {{detailed}} description of an extreme cold surge that occurred 3 - 13 March 1987, over Greece. This event has been rated as the worst snowfall over the last 100 years and, duc to its severily and persistence, it paralysed the cconornic and communal life of Greece for several days. Emphasis is given to the initiation phase of this event. The structural evolution of the cold surge is analysed using both observations and model results. Model simulations, pcrformed with the Colorado State University-Regional Atmospheric Modelling System, provided the necessary data to diagnose the mesoscale structure of the cold outbreak. Different mechanisms involved in the structural evolution ofthe cold surge are investigated. The gustiness of the observed winds and their significant departure from geostrophy are related to the role of an important <b>isallobaric</b> <b>wind.</b> The progression of this surge presented characteristics of a density current, while near the eastern slopes of the mountain barriers of continental Greece cold-air damming occurred, leading to an accelerated flow parallcl to the mountains...|$|E
40|$|Dust aerosol is {{important}} in the Earth system, but the relative impact of meteorological mechanisms on North African dust emission remains unclear. This study presents the first climatology of dust emission amounts associated with Harmattan surges (HSs), characterized by postfrontal strengthening of near-surface winds. A new automated identification uses their strong <b>isallobaric</b> <b>winds</b> as an indicator for HSs in 32 years of ERA-Interim reanalysis. Their impact on dust aerosol emission is estimated by combining the identified events with derived dust emissions. The estimate highlights that about one third of the total emission mass is associated with HSs. Spring shows the largest associated emissions of 30 - 50 % of the monthly totals consistent with the largest number and duration of HSs. Regional emission contributions of up to 80 % in the north coincide with the overall largest emission maxima in spring. The importance of HSs for dust emission implies that aerosol-climate models need to accurately represent synoptic-scale storms. © 2015. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved...|$|R

40|$|Meso-α/β/γ scale {{atmospheric}} processes of jet dynamics responsible for generating Harmattan, Saudi Arabian, and Bodélé Depression dust storms are analyzed with observations and high-resolution modeling. The {{analysis of the}} role of jet adjustment processes in each dust storm shows similarities as follows: (1) the presence of a well-organized baroclinic synoptic scale system, (2) cross mountain flows that produced a leeside inversion layer prior to the large-scale dust storm, (3) the presence of thermal wind imbalance in the exit region of the midtropospheric jet streak in the lee of the respective mountains shortly after the time of the inversion formation, (4) dust storm formation accompanied by large magnitude ageostrophic <b>isallobaric</b> low-level <b>winds</b> as part of the meso-β scale adjustment process, (5) substantial low-level turbulence kinetic energy (TKE), and (6) emission and uplift of mineral dust in the lee of nearby mountains. The thermally forced meso-γ scale adjustment processes, which occurred in the canyons/small valleys, may have been the cause of numerous observed dust streaks leading to the entry of the dust into the atmosphere due to the presence of significant vertical motion and TKE generation. This study points to the importance of meso-β to meso-γ scale adjustment processes at low atmospheric levels due to an imbalance within the exit region of an upper level jet streak for the formation of severe dust storms. The low level TKE, {{which is one of the}} prerequisites to deflate the dust from the surface, cannot be detected with the low resolution data sets; so our results show that a high spatial resolution is required for better representing TKE as a proxy for dust emission. © 2017.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Circulation and transport of the low-level jet (LLJ) were examined for a case of severe convection that occurred in Spring 1995. Radiosonde observations and Eta model output on constant pressure and isentropic surfaces allowed a detailed examination {{of the relationship between the}} LLJ and a subtropical jet (STJ) streak. Height falls associated with a lee cyclone caused an ageostrophic and isallobalic wind that strengthened the LLJ. The smaller horizontal resolution of Eta model giids and hourly forecasts allowed a detailed examination of the LLJ evolution and transport methods. The model's accurate placement of terrain provided realistic plots of the LLJ at the commonly used 850 mb level. The radiosonde observations, when interpolated to grid points, yielded suspicious results over higher terrain. The hourly forecast of transport variables revealed a step-by-step progression of convection along ridges of equivalent potential temperature advection. The evolution of the LLJ appeared to be influenced by a thermally indirect circulation (TIC) induced in the exit region of a STJ streak. A low-level isaflobaric wind responding to a leeside trough and cyclogenesis also effected the LLJ. The TIC is part of the ageostrophic circulation in the exit region of the streak. The low-level <b>isallobaric</b> <b>wind</b> coincided with a trough moving east over the northern Great Plains and a deepening trough in the lee of the Rockies. Results of the case study for the LLJ evolution showed 1) The LLJ developed beneath a STJ streak exit region as the lower branch of an indirect circulation. 2) A strong cross-contour ageostrophic wind in the lower troposphere aided in accelerating the LLJ. 3) The LLJ strengthened in response to a isaflobaric wind associated with lee cyclogenesis. 4) LLJ speed and magnitude decreased during a transition between the large scale forcing mechanisms as the ageostrophic circulation, cross-contour ageostrophic wind, and isabobaiic wind all weakened. 5) Eta model hourly forecasts fairly well predicted heat and water vapor transport, offering an hourly look at convective movement...|$|E
40|$|Meso-α/β scale {{observational}} and meso-β/γ scale {{numerical model}} {{analyses were performed}} to study the atmospheric dynamics responsible for generating Harmattan dust storm. For this dust storm case study, MERRA reanalysis datasets, WRF simulated very high resolution datasets, MODIS/Aqua and Terra images, EUMETSAT images, NAAPS aerosol modelling plots, surface observations, and rawinsonde soundings were analyzed. The analysis of this dust storm shows (1) {{the presence of a}} well-organized baroclinic synoptic scale system, (2) this dust storm composed of two dust storm events, (3) small scale dust emission events (first dust storm event) which occurred prior to the formation of the primary large-scale dust storms (second dust storm event), (4) cross Atlas Mountain flows which produced a strong leeside inversion layer prior to the large scale dust storm, (5) the presence of thermal wind imbalance in the exit region of the mid-tropospheric jet streak in the lee of the Atlas Mountains shortly after the time of the inversion formation, (6) major dust storm formation was accompanied by large magnitude ageostrophic <b>isallobaric</b> low-level <b>winds</b> as part of the meso-β scale adjustment process, (7) substantial low-level turbulence kinetic energy (TKE), and (8) the emission of the dust occurred initially in narrow meso-β scale zones parallel to the mountains, and later reached the meso-α scale when suspended dust was transported away from the mountains. In addition to this there were additional meso-β and meso-γ scale adjustment processes resulting in Kelvin waves and the thermally-forced MPS circulation, respectively. The Kelvin wave preceded a cold pool accompanying the air behind the large scale cold front instrumental in the major dust storm. The Kelvin wave organized the major dust storm in a narrow zone parallel to the mountains before it expanded upscale (meso-α to synoptic scale). The thermally-forced meso-γ scale adjustment processes, which occurred in the canyons, resulted in the numerous dust streaks leading to the entry of the dust into the atmosphere due to the presence of significant vertical motion and the TKE generation. This indicates that there were meso-β to meso-γ scale adjustment processes at the lower levels after the imbalance within the exit region of the upper level jet streak and these processes were responsible for causing this large scale dust storm (synoptic scale) ...|$|R
