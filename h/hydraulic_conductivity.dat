5|$|Although Gert's center {{remained}} off {{the coast}} of Costa Rica, its large circulation produced brisk winds and heavy rainfall across the country. A local weather station recorded 13.1inches (332mm) of rain during the storm. Geologically, the hardest-hit regions consisted of sedimentary layers with poor <b>hydraulic</b> <b>conductivity</b> and were therefore prone to soil saturation. The initial rainfall raised the levels of many rivers, exacerbating the flood threat. The imminent overflow of the Tempisque River prompted wide-scale evacuations, though the river crested gradually without major consequence. After hours of prolonged rainfall, many Pacific regions such as Quepos, Pérez Zeledón, and Osa experienced flooding and landslides, which inflicted moderate damage to roads and bridges.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the effect of filled waste {{disposal}} trenches on transport-governing soil properties, comparisons were made between profiles of undisturbed soil and disturbed soil in a simulated waste trench. The changes in soil properties induced by {{the construction of a}} simulated waste trench were measured near the Radioactive Waste Management Complex at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) in the semiarid southeast region of Idaho. The soil samples were collected, using a hydraulically-driven sampler to minimize sample disruption, from both a simulated waste trench and an undisturbed area nearby. Results show that the undisturbed profile has distinct layers whose properties differ significantly, whereas the soil profile in the simulated waste trench is, by comparison, homogeneous. Porosity was increased in the disturbed cores, and, correspondingly, saturated <b>hydraulic</b> <b>conductivities</b> were on average three times higher. With higher soil-moisture contents (greater than 0. 32), unsaturated <b>hydraulic</b> <b>conductivities</b> for the undisturbed cores were typically greater than those for the disturbed cores.

Saltcake simulant was placed in column equipped with tensiometers and flow meters. Variable pressure boundary conditions ranging from 100 to 500 cm were applied along the column, outflow and the pressure head were measured with respect to time. The experimental data was analyzed using an inverse modeling software and the van Genuchten 2 ̆ 7 s hydraulic parameters for unsaturated porous media were determined. In addition, the unsaturated <b>hydraulic</b> <b>conductivities</b> were obtained as a function of the moisture content. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>conductivities</b> ranged from 5. 36 E- 5 to 4. 29 E- 2 cm/hr.

40|$|Though the {{ensemble}} Kalman filter (EnKF) {{has been successfully}} applied in many areas, it requires explicit and accurate model and measurement error information, leading to difficulties in practice when only limited information on error mechanisms of observational instruments for subsurface systems is accessible. To handle the uncertain errors, we applied a robust data assimilation algorithm, {{the ensemble}} H-infinity filter (EnHF), to estimation of aquifer <b>hydraulic</b> heads and <b>conductivities</b> in a flow model with uncertain/correlated observational errors. The impacts of spatial and temporal correlations in measurements were analyzed, {{and the performance of}} EnHF was compared with that of the EnKF. The results show that both EnHF and EnKF are able to estimate <b>hydraulic</b> <b>conductivities</b> properly when observations are free of error; EnHF can provide robust estimates of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>conductivities</b> even when no observational error information is provided. In contrast, the estimates of EnKF seem noticeably undermined because of correlated errors and inaccurate error statistics, and filter divergence was observed.

40|$|Graduation date: 1981 Surface and {{subsurface}} hydrological parameters affecting {{overland flow}} from cultivated land were studied in three small sub-watersheds {{located in the}} western foothills of the Willamette Valley. The sub-watersheds, which ranged in size from 0. 46 to 6. 0 -ha, were fall-planted to grass or small grain. The parameters studied were infiltration, rainfall, runoff and subsurface water measurements. Infiltration measurements were obtained monthly using a portable infiltrometer. Rainfall was measured with recording and non-recording rain gages. Runoff was monitored from the sub-watershed outlets and within the watersheds using H-flumes and erosion plots, respectively. Subsurface moisture conditions were monitored with wells, piezometers and tensiometers. Seasonal changes in soil surface and moisture conditions caused seasonal variations in steady state infiltration rates. Low antecedent moisture and fail cropping practices produced rough, highly permeable surfaces {{which resulted in a}} high steady state infiltration rate (6. 8 cm/hr). Winter rains caused increased antecedent moisture and surface sealing, and the final infiltration rate was found to decreased to a low of 4. 0 cm/hr. Decreased storm events in the spring caused cracks to develop in the crust producing infiltration rates {{similar to those of the}} fall. Saturated <b>hydraulic</b> <b>conductivities,</b> measured with core samples from different horizons indicated decreased <b>hydraulic</b> <b>conductivities</b> in lower horizons. In some cases the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>conductivities</b> were virtually zero in the Cr horizon. Bimodal pore desaturations were noted in unsaturated <b>hydraulic</b> <b>conductivities</b> measured by a continuous drainage method. Piezometers and tensiometers indicated positive pore water pressures above moisture flow impeding layers. Hydrostatic pressures developed after rainy seasons started, producing ephemeral perched water tables. Ephemeral perched water tables were at or near ground surfaces during storm periods, causing saturated surface conditions. In lower landscape positions the ephemeral water table intersected the soil surface producing seepage zones. Seepage areas produced runoff between and during storm periods from plots located in the lower landscape position. Runoff from plots in the lower landscape position occasionally exceeded that of plots in upper landscape position by more than 50...|$|R

40|$|A semi-analytical {{solution}} is presented {{for the problem}} of flow in a system consisting of unconfined and confined aquifers, separated by an aquitard. The unconfined aquifer is pumped continuously at a constant rate from a well of infinitesimal radius that partially penetrates its saturated thickness. The {{solution is}} termed semi-analytical because the exact solution obtained in double Laplace–Hankel transform space is inverted numerically. The solution presented here is more general than similar solutions obtained for confined aquifer flow as we do not adopt the assumption of unidirectional flow in the confined aquifer (typically assumed to be horizontal) and the aquitard (typically assumed to be vertical). Model predicted results show significant departure from the solution that {{does not take into}} account the effect of leakage even for cases where aquitard <b>hydraulic</b> <b>conductivities</b> are two orders of magnitude smaller than those of the aquifers. The results show low sensitivity to changes in radial <b>hydraulic</b> <b>conductivities</b> for aquitards that are two or more orders of magnitude smaller than those of the aquifers, in conformity to findings of earlier workers that radial flow in aquitards may be neglected under such conditions. Hence, for cases were aquitard <b>hydraulic</b> <b>conductivities</b> are two or more orders of magnitude smaller than aquifer conductivities, the simpler models that restrict flow to the radial direction in aquifers and to the vertical direction in aquitards may be sufficient. However, the model developed here can be used to model flow in aquifer–aquitard systems where radial flow is significant in aquitards...|$|R
