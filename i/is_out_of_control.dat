5|$|Obsidian is an action-adventure {{computer}} {{game for the}} Amstrad CPC personal computer published by Artic Computing in 1986. The game is set on the titular space station located within the centre of an asteroid, which <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and drifting towards a black hole. The player must guide an astronaut with a jet pack around the station and re-activate its engine shields to prevent the Obsidian's destruction. This involves collecting items and using them to solve puzzles, while avoiding the Obsidian's reactivated security systems.|$|E
25|$|Often {{there is}} a {{noticeable}} difference between the perceived risk of becoming a victim of crime and the statistical probability. However, hearing about events in the media or knowing others who have been victimised increases public perception {{of the risk of}} victimisation. In some western countries, crime accounts for up to 25% of news coverage. The formation of a ‘fear of crime' feedback loop allows more citizens to be surveyed as fearful, more politicians {{to be able to use}} crime fear as a political issue, in an ever increasing spiral that crime <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E
25|$|The ADA {{provides}} explicit {{coverage for}} service animals. Guidelines {{have been developed}} not only to protect persons with disabilities, but also to indemnify businesses from damages related to granting access to service animals on their premises. Businesses are allowed to ask if the animal is a service animal and ask what tasks it is trained to perform, {{but they are not}} allowed to ask the service animal to perform the task nor ask for a special ID of the animal. They can not ask what the person's disabilities are. A person with a disability can not be removed from the premises unless either of two things happen: the animal <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and its owner can not get it under control (e.g. a dog barking uncontrollably in a restaurant), or the animal is a direct threat to people's health and safety. Allergies and fear of animal would not be considered a threat to people's health and safety so {{it would not be a}} valid reason to deny access to people with service animals. Businesses that prepare or serve food must allow service animals and their owners on the premises even if state or local health laws otherwise prohibit animals on the premise. In this case, businesses that prepare or serve food are not required to provide care or food for service animals nor do they have to provide a designated area for the service animal to use the bathroom. Lastly, people that require service dogs can not be charged an extra fee for their service dog or be treated unfairly. For example, being isolated from people at a restaurant. People with disabilities can not be treated less than other customers. However, if a business normally charges for damages caused by the person to property, the customer with a disability will be charged for his/her service animal's damages to the property.|$|E

[...] "Maybe the group Sea Turtle Conservation with Guns should be formed to fight back." [...] An editorial published by the Tico Times asked why it took a murder to get the government to act. [...] "Mora reached out for help before he was killed, and no one came to the rescue, no matter what political spin is put on it", said the author. [...] Mora's death, suggested the author, shows that [...] "the drug traffickers are winning", that crime <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> in Limón, and that [...] "the bad guys operate with near impunity." [...] The editorial concluded by imploring Costa Ricans to re-evaluate their personal environmental habits and support environmental groups that keep fighting. [...] The Guápiles Biofestival, an arts festival held each year during early June, was also dedicated to Mora.|$|E

Ripley convinces him to help her {{in exchange for a}} ride off the station aboard the Torrens, but Axel is eventually killed by the monster in question, an alien creature. While exploring the station, Ripley finds the Nostromos flight recorder but discovers, to her dismay, that it contains no data. After contacting Samuels and recovering medical supplies to treat an injured Taylor, Ripley reunites with the station's marshal, Waits, and his deputy, Ricardo. Waits explains that the alien was brought on board the station by Anesidora captain Henry Marlow, who is now in Waits' custody. Ripley learns from Marlow that the Anesidora crew discovered the flight recorder near the planetoid LV-426, where they also found a derelict ship previously found by the Nostromo crew and the nest of alien eggs contained within. While exploring the ship, Marlow's wife was attacked by a facehugger. Marlow then brought her aboard Sevastopol for emergency medical treatment, but an alien ultimately hatched from her. Waits convinces Ripley to contain the alien by luring it into a remote section of the station and sealing it inside. Ripley is successful, but Waits truly plotted to use Ripley as bait, and ejects the module from the station with her still inside. As the module careens into space towards KG348, Ripley space-jumps back to Sevastopol using an EVA suit.|$|E

2500|$|Penal {{populism}} is {{a process}} whereby the major political parties {{compete with each other}} to be [...] "tough on crime".

Penal populism generally reflects the disenchantment felt by a distinct segment of society— crime victims and their representatives— who believe they have been left out, or simply forgotten, by justice processes which focus on the offender. It leads to the pursuit of penal policies designed to win votes rather than reduce crime or promote justice.|$|E
