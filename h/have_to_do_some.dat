500|$|NBC had renewed Homicide for {{a second}} season to assess how the show {{performed}} in the Nielsen ratings and make a determination whether to continue the series. The series premiere, [...] "Bop Gun", drew unusually large viewership numbers due to a guest appearance by Robin Williams, but the subsequent episodes had dropped in the ratings, making the viewership of [...] "A Many Splendored Thing" [...] particularly important {{for the future of}} the series. Fontana said if the episode performed well, [...] "NBC's going to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>some</b> hard thinking." [...] In its original American broadcast on January 27, 1994, [...] "A Many Splendored Thing" [...] was watched by 11.2 million households, according to Nielsen Media Research, earning the episode an 11.9 rating. That constituted a slight increase from the previous week's episode, [...] "Black and Blue", which was seen by 10.83 million households. It was the 37th highest rated television show of the week, tied with the Fox animated comedy series The Simpsons. [...] "A Many Splendored Thing" [...] faced unusually tough competition in its timeslot from the ABC news series Primetime Live, which did a special report about convicted murderer Richard Allen Davis.|$|E
500|$|GameTrailers {{noted that}} while the plot was simple and the party members generic, the game's {{scenarios}} were [...] "top notch." [...] It additionally noted that while players should expect to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>some</b> grinding, the game offers [...] "lots of little areas to explore." [...] IGN described the game as one that may be [...] "amazingly frustrating for the now mainstream Final Fantasy fan," [...] and noted {{that while the}} unique concept of the job system was one that [...] "simply blew gamers' minds" [...] at the time, in the contemporary environment, comparing it to Final Fantasy XIIs license board system was [...] "literally no contest." [...] The review additionally argued that the remake hampered the game, citing that battles that would take [...] "mere seconds to scroll through" [...] were now [...] "lengthened to nearly a minute." [...] Another complaint was in the game's presentation on the Nintendo DS, noting that the handheld's top screen was inactive for [...] "75% of the game," [...] and that even displaying only artwork on the screen during those periods {{would have been a}} preferable outcome. However IGN described the game as [...] "graphically phenomenal and...set to a simply beautiful musical score." [...] They also stated that the transition from 2D to 3D was [...] "a good call." ...|$|E
500|$|MPC {{additionally}} {{worked on}} the disappearing waterfall that serves as Jennifer's grave when she is killed {{at the beginning of}} the film. They transformed the mysterious waterfall into a whirlpool. [...] "We came up with an approach that we thought would work because we had a lot of confidence in our water sims", stated Nordby. [...] "The waterfall appears both as a day and night shot, so we had to integrate with the water. And the night shots play a pivotal role in the film, and we do a huge crane over." [...] They could not lock it to a pan or to a tilt and filming the shots was difficult due to the actual base of the waterfall being out of reach. Nordby said, [...] "I eventually lowered down a shot—a ton of reference of the area because I knew we'd <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>some</b> digi-matte work to recreate the basin that the whirlpool ends up in." [...] They soon realized that there was an insufficient amount of churning and foam to read as real as the location. The CG Supervisor, Pete Dionne, presented a different idea. [...] "He grabbed chunks of that river and tialing it so that it had a nice stretch of birds' eye point of view of the water that existed on the location in the lighting situation we were trying to match", stated Nordby. [...] "And then he projected that onto a whirlpool of animated sprites and had similar enough texture to the actual water that existed there, but pulled control into lighting it and could add depth mainly to the center of it." [...] Dealing with [...] "very shallow" [...] water, the team had to take extra care when filming the scenes.|$|E

At 10:00a.m. on July 24, Murray and Fairless were ushered into the Oval Office. Truman informed the two men of top-secret statistics which showed the U.S. war effort in Korea was being crippled.

I want it settled by tomorrow morning, or I will have some things to say that you won't like to hear, and I will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>some</b> things you won't like."
