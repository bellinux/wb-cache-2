500|$|After Katsura {{arrived in}} the U.S., she gave a private {{exhibition}} for Cochran, who {{wanted to make sure}} she was as good as reported before finalizing the invitation. At that meeting she clicked off runs of 300 and 400 at straight rail, made in the words of Cochran [...] "almost unbelievable shots" [...] after switching to balkline, and showed high competence at three-cushion, consistently scoring. Cochran made the invite [...] "final" [...] and stated: [...] "She's the most marvelous thing I ever saw... She's liable to beat anybody, even Willie Hoppe... <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> any weak spots... She's going to give lots of those players fits." [...] As a warm-up for the competition Katsura gave a number of billiard exhibitions during February 1952.|$|E
500|$|... "The general discontent I {{felt with}} woman's portion as wife, housekeeper, physician, and spiritual guide, the chaotic {{conditions}} into which everything fell without her constant supervision, and the wearied, anxious {{look of the}} majority of women, impressed me with a strong feeling that some active measures should be taken to remedy the wrongs of society in general, and of women in particular. My experience at the World Anti-slavery Convention, all I had read of the legal status of women, and the oppression I saw everywhere, together swept across my soul, intensified now by many personal experiences. It seemed as if all the elements had conspired to impel me to some onward step. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> what to do or where to begin—my only thought was a public meeting for protest and discussion." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2013, The Islamic Society in Denmark {{stated that}} they regretted their visit to Lebanon and Egypt in 2006 to show the caricatures because the {{consequences}} had been much more serious than they expected. In August 2013, Ahmed Akkari expressed his regret {{for his role in}} the Imams' tour of the Middle East, stating [...] "I want to be clear today about the trip: It was totally wrong. At that time, I was so fascinated with this logical force in the Islamic mindset that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> the greater picture. I was convinced it was a fight for my faith, Islam." [...] Still a practising Muslim, he said that printing the cartoons was ok and he personally apologised to the cartoonist Westergaard. Westergaard responded by saying [...] "I met a man who has converted from being an Islamist to become a humanist who understands the values of our society. To me, he is really sincere, convincing and strong in his views." [...] A spokesman for the Islamic Society of Denmark said [...] "It is still not OK to publish drawings of Muhammad. We have not changed our position." ...|$|E
500|$|No. 80 Wing {{had begun}} {{transferring}} to the Dutch East Indies in December 1944, {{and the main}} body followed in January 1945. Gibbes' injuries prevented him from joining the formation at its base on Morotai, where it came {{under the control of}} the Australian First Tactical Air Force (No.1 TAF), until 9March. Once there, he took over as temporary commanding officer for a few days when Caldwell was called to Manila. In April, Gibbes was one of eight senior pilots, including Caldwell and fellow aces Wilf Arthur and John Waddy, who tendered their resignations in protest at the relegation of RAAF fighter squadrons to apparently worthless ground-attack missions. The incident became known as the [...] "Morotai Mutiny". Gibbes later declared that [...] "...after I myself had been operating for a week or so and had a really good look around and seen the futility of the operations which had been given, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> any point in carrying on. I certainly lost all keenness for remaining in the service." [...] As a former jackaroo, he was especially upset about one sortie that involved attacking cattle: [...] "I felt horrible about it, being an ex bushy...at about lunch time I went out and darned if I didn't have to turn butcher. And Heavens, it was butchering too, in every sense of the word. No—not the Japs. Cattle...If we are to get the Japs out of this area without loss of human lives, starvation will be our main weapon...God, I hated doing it but could do nothing else. Felt as sick as hell." [...] No action was taken against the [...] "mutineers" [...] for their attempted resignations; a subsequent government inquiry found that their protest was justified. In the meantime, Gibbes and Caldwell were court martialled for their involvement in alcohol trafficking on Morotai. Both were reduced to the rank of flight lieutenant; the Air Officer Commanding No.1 TAF, Air Commodore Harry Cobby, himself shortly to be dismissed over the [...] "mutiny", restored Gibbes to squadron leader effective [...] 23April.|$|E

"Among {{some talk}} {{of you and}} me" [...] may be a {{reference}} to [...] of Edward FitzGerald's translation of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam ("There was a Door to which I found no Key / There was a Veil past which <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> / Some little Talk awhile of Me and Thee / There seemed — and then no more of Thee and Me.") ...|$|E

2500|$|McGuinness {{then led}} {{his team to}} the 2012 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final with a {{comprehensive}} semi-final defeat of title-favourites Cork at Croke Park. Ahead of the match, nobody outside the county gave Donegal a chance, and Cork went into the game as heavy favourites to win the title itself (even though this was only the semi-final). Tyrone's Mickey Harte, attempting to analyse the game for the BBC, expressed his shock: [...] "To be honest, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> that coming. Donegal annihilated Cork, {{there is no other}} word for it." [...] Martin McHugh, a member of the successful 1992 side, said it was the best ever performance by any Donegal team, including his own.|$|E
2500|$|Donegal progressed {{directly}} to the All-Ireland quarter finals after retaining the Ulster Senior Football Championship following victories against Cavan, Derry, Tyrone and Down. They defeated Kerry at this stage; {{it was the first}} Championship meeting between the sides at senior level. Kerry had been defeated at this stage only once before. Donegal played Cork in the semi-finals. Cork were favourites to win both the match and the championship, but Donegal reached the final following a 016 [...] 111 (14 points) victory. Tyrone's Mickey Harte, a BBC analyst that day, expressed his shock: [...] "To be honest, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> that coming.

2500|$|Some writers {{expressed}} {{surprise at}} Melba's playing {{the last of}} these roles, since it was merely a supporting part in the opera. She played it on many occasions, saying in her memoirs, [...] "Why on earth a prima donna should not sing secondary rôles <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> then and am no nearer seeing to-day. I hate the artistic snobbery of it." [...] She sang the role opposite the Carmens of Emma Calvé, Zélie de Lussan and Maria Gay. Marguerite de Valois, too, is not the leading female role in Les Huguenots, but Melba was willing to undertake it as seconda donna to Emma Albani. She was generous in support of singers who did not rival her in her favoured roles, but was, as her biographer J. B. Steane put it, [...] "pathologically critical" [...] of other lyric sopranos.|$|E

2500|$|On 22 July 2012, Donegal {{retained}} the Ulster {{title for the}} first time in their history with a 2-18 to 0-13 victory over Down. On 5 August 2012, they defeated Kerry. The first ever Championship meeting between the sides at senior level, it was only the second time in history that Kerry had been defeated at the quarter final stage. Ahead of their next match against Cork, few outside the county gave Donegal a chance, and Cork went into the game as heavy favourites to win the title itself (even though this was only the semi-final). Donegal endeavoured to swat aside a lacklustre Cork side with ease and progressed to their first title decider since 1992. Tyrone's Mickey Harte, attempting to analyse the game for the BBC, expressed his shock: [...] "To be honest, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> that coming. Donegal annihilated Cork, there is no other word for it." [...] Martin McHugh, a member of the successful 1992 side, said it was the best ever performance by any Donegal team including his own. Donegal emerged victorious from the 2012 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final on 23 September 2012 to take the Sam Maguire Cup for the second time, with early goals from Michael Murphy and Colm McFadden. They defeated Mayo, on a scoreline of 2-11 to 0-13. Man of the Match was awarded to Michael Murphy, who scored 1-04.|$|E
