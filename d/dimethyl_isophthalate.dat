The {{aim of the}} present study is to systematically investigate the most favorable conditions for the enzyme catalyzed synthesis of aromatic-aliphatic oligomers using commercially available monomers. Reaction conditions and enzyme selectivity for polymerization of various commercially available monomers were considered using different inactivated/activated aromatic monomers combined with linear polyols ranging from C 2 to C 12. The effect of various reaction solvents in enzymatic polymerization was assessed and toluene allowed to achieve the highest conversions for the reaction of <b>dimethyl</b> <b>isophthalate</b> with 1, 4 -butanediol and with 1, 10 -decanediol (88 and 87 % monomer conversion respectively). Mw as high as 1512 Da was obtained from the reaction of <b>dimethyl</b> <b>isophthalate</b> with, 10 -decanediol. The obtained oligomers have potential applications as raw materials in personal and home care formulations, for the production of aliphatic-aromatic block co-polymers or can be further functionalized with various moieties for a subsequent photo- or radical polymerization...|$|E

The oligoesters and the glycolysates are characterized by H- 1 NMR, size exclusion chromatography (SEC). differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analyses and matrix assisted laser desorptionlionisation time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS).

Complete degradation of DMI required both species of bacteria at different biochemical transformation steps. The biochemical degradation pathway was DMI to monomethyl isophthalate (MMI) by K. oxytoca Sc, MMI to isophthalate (IPA) by M. mesophilium Sr, and IPA by both K. oxytoca Sc and M. mesophilium Sr sequentially. The consortium comprising of K. oxytoca Sc and M. mesophilicum Sr was effective in complete degradation of DMI in eight days.

40|$|NADP-glutamate {{dehydrogenase}} (NADP-GDH) {{along with}} glutamine synthetase plays {{a pivotal role}} in ammonium assimilation. Specific inhibitors were valuable in defining the importance of glutamine synthetase in nitrogen metabolism. Selective in vivo inhibition of NADP-GDH has so far been an elusive desideratum. Isophthalate, a potent in vitro inhibitor of Aspergillus niger NADP-GDH [Noor S, Punekar NS. Allosteric NADP-glutamate dehydrogenase from aspergilli: purification, characterization and implications for metabolic regulation at the carbon-nitrogen interface. Microbiology 2005; 151 : 1409 - 19], was evaluated for its efficacy in vivo. <b>Dimethyl</b> ester of <b>isophthalate</b> (DMIP), but not isophthalate, inhibited A. niger growth on agar as well as in liquid culture. This was ascribed to the inability of isophthalate to enter fungal mycelia. Subsequent to DMIP addition however, intracellular isophthalate could be demonstrated. Apart from NAD-GDH, no other enzyme including NAD-glutamate synthase was inhibited by isophthalate. A cross-over at NADP-GDH step of metabolism was observed as a direct consequence of isophthalate (formed in vivo from DMIP) inhibiting this enzyme. Addition of ammonium to DMEP-treated A. niger mycelia resulted in intensive vacuolation, retraction of cytoplasm and autolysis. Taken together, these results implicate glutamate dehydrogenase and NADP-GDH in particular, as a key target of in vivo isophthalate inhibition during ammonium assimilation. (C) 200...|$|R

The phthalate segments of these polymers are isomers with different patterns of substitution (ortho, meta, para) of the methyl carboxylate groups on the phenyl ring.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} and {{characterization of}} bisester-oligoamides segments with varying segment length {{that can be}} used in segmented block copolymers were studied. The bisester-oligoamides segments were made form diamines and terephthalate or isophthalate esters. The diamines used were p-xylylene diamine, m-xylylene diamine and hexamethylene diamine. The esters used are dimethyl terephthalate, diphenyl terephthalate, <b>dimethyl</b> <b>isophthalate</b> and diphenyl isophthalate. Uniform bisester-diamide, bisester-(tetra-amides) and bisester-(hexa-amide) segments were synthesized in steps and characterized by 1 H NMR, MALDI-TOF and DSC. The uniformity of these segments was studied by MALDI-TOF. With the uniform amide segments and polypropylene oxide segments, block copolymers were prepared by high temperature melt polymerization. The amide segment length distribution, which is susceptible to randomization was studied. The analysis of the amide segment distribution after hydrolysis of the ester-linkage groups was by MALDI-TOF. The amide segments were found to have the same narrow distribution as the starting bisester-oligoamide, which strongly supports the fact that randomization of the amide segments during melt polymerization does not take place. The uniformity of the amide segments is, therefore, preserved during high temperature melt polymerization...|$|E

DMI was rapidly transformed by K. oxytoca Sc in the culture with formation of monomethyl isophthalate (MMI), which accumulated in the culture medium. M. mesophilicum Sr, incapable of utilizing DMI, showed high capability of degrading MMI to a transitory intermediate isophthalic acid (IPA), which was further mineralized by this strain. The biochemical pathway of DMI degradation by these two bacteria in a consortium was proposed: DMI to MMI by K. oxytoca Sc, MMI to IPA by M. mesophilicum Sr, and IPA by both K. oxytoca Sc and M. mesophilicum Sr based on the identified degradation intermediates. The consortium comprising K. oxytoca Sc and M. mesophilicum Sr was effective in mineralization of DMI.

40|$|Five morphologically {{distinct}} bacteria {{isolated from}} mangrove sediment by enrichment culture, {{were identified and}} tested {{for their ability to}} degrade dimethyl terephthalate （DMT） and its isomer <b>dimethyl</b> <b>isophthalate</b> (DMI). DMT at a concentration of 98 mg/L was degraded completely within 36 days at an initial pH 7. 0 ，and two intermediates were identified as monomethyl terephthalate and terephthalic acid. DMI at a concentration of 220 mg/L was degraded within 35 days by a mixed culture, but one of the intermediates was identified as monomethyl isophthalate and accumulated in the culture. Based on the chemical structures of intermediates identified, the possible metabolic pathway of DMT was proposed as: DMT→MMT→TA →CO 2 + H 2 O. Our results suggested that DMT be easier to be degraded than DMI.

40|$|Viarovorax paradoxus T 4 strain was {{isolated}} from deep-ocean sediment and demonstrated {{to be able}} to degrade <b>dimethyl</b> <b>isophthalate</b> (DMI). When DMI was utilized as the sole source of carbon and energy, it was transformed by hydrolysis initially, forming monomethyl isophthalate (MMI) and isophthalate acid (IA) as degradation intermediates. DMI and MMI were completely transformed to MMI and IA in about 100 h, respectively. Degradation of IA was completed in about 55 h. Analysis of total organic carbon in the culture medium confirmed that more than 80 % of the substrate carbon was mineralized. Bacterial esterase induced by a range of substrates could be assessed using p-nitrophenyl acetate as the common substrate using crude enzyme preparation. The decreasing trend of Km values derived from the Michaelis-Menten equation was dimethyl phthalate (DMP) > monomethyl phthalate (MMP) > dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) > Liver esterase > DMI > MMI > monomethyl terephthalate (MMT), indicating that higher Km values were obtained by di-esters than mono-ester and the esters induced by terephthalate esters showed the highest activity. This investigation suggests that biochemical pathways for phthalate esters share many common characteristics and the esterases induced by different substrates are highly specific.

The ortho diesters, dimethyl phthalate (DMP) and diethyl phthalate (DEP) produced a positive dose-related mutagenic response with Salmonella TA 100, {{but only in the}} absence of S- 9 liver enzymes. Dibutyl, di(2 -ethylhexyl), mono(2 ethylhexyl), and butyl benzyl phthalate as well as the <b>dimethyl</b> <b>isophthalate</b> and terephthalates and the trimethyl ester, trimellitate, were not mutagenic with TA 100 or TA 98 in {{the presence or absence of}} S- 9. In a host-mediated assay, extracts of 24 -hr urines of rats injected IP with DMP (2 g/kg) were not mutagenic to TA 100 at levels up to 8 equivalent-ml of urine/plate (representing 30 % of their daily urinary output). In vitro studies revealed that S- 9 associated esterase hydrolyzed DMP to the monoester and methanol and eliminated its mutagenicity. Whole rat skin was shown to have about 1. 5 % of the DMP-esterase activity of liver, when compared on a wet weight basis. An in vitro binding study indicated that epidermal macromolecules bound DMP at a severalfold greater rate than hepatic macromolecules. Thus, both the mutagenicity and binding of DMP are inversely related to the metabolism of this compound.

40|$|Segmented {{copolymers}} with crystallizable uniform p-phenyleneterephthalamide ester {{units and}} soft poly(tetramethyleneoxide) (PTMO) segments were synthesized by polycondensation. Long PTMO (> 1000 g/mol) segments {{are known to}} crystallize around room temperature which reduces the low temperature flexibility of the copolymers. The PTMO crystallization was reduced by incorporating chemical irregularity. PTMO 1000 – 9000 segments having a reduced tendency to crystallize are formed by extending PTMO 650 or PTMO 1000 with dimethyl terephthalate or <b>dimethyl</b> <b>isophthalate.</b> Furthermore modified PTMO segments (PTMOm: 15 wt% of methyl side groups) were used. The thermal and dynamic mechanical properties of the copolymers were studied with DSC and DMA, respectively. In addition, the PTMO crystallization was studied with synchrotron WAXS measurements. PTMOm segments melt about 20 °C lower than PTMO. PTMO 1000, DMT and DMI extended PTMO 1000 and PTMOm strain crystallize reversibly, while PTMO 1400 and longer strain crystallize irreversibly. Reversible strain-induced crystallization of the PTMO phase gives the polymers a relatively high tensile strength combined with a good recovery from tensile deformation. The glass transition temperature of the polymers is not increased by incorporation of the stiff terephthalic or isophthalic units in the PTMO phase. The p-phenyleneterephthalamide ester units crystallize fast and nearly completely due to their uniform length. Even at a concentration of only 3 wt% of p-phenyleneterephthalamide ester units dimensionally stable polymers with a relatively high melting temperature were formed...|$|E
40|$|Phthalate ester isomers, {{including}} {{dimethyl phthalate}} (DMP), <b>dimethyl</b> <b>isophthalate</b> (DMI) and dimethyl terephthalate (DMT), {{were found to}} be transformed by Rhodococcus rubber Sa isolated from a mangrove sediment using DMT as a carbon source initially. At a concentration of 80 mg l - 1, transformation of DMP, DMI and DMT was achieved in 9, 1 and 5 days, respectively. During the hydrolytical transformation of DMP, DMI and DMT, their corresponding intermediates were identified as mono-methyl phthalate (MMP), mono-methyl isophthalate (MMI) and mono-methyl terephthalate (MMT), suggesting that transformation of all three isomers followed an identical biochemical pathway of de-esterification. However, none of the produced monoesters was further transformed by R. rubber Sa and they accumulated in the culture media during incubation. It seems that further transformation of monoesters require a set of hydrolytic enzymes different from those involved in the first transformation reaction. Kinetics of DMT, DMI and DMP transformation was well described by the modified Gompertz model independent of the individual substrate condition or a mixture of the three isomers. Both DMI and DMT were easier transformed substrates than DMP, resulting in higher maximum transformation rate (R m) and shorter lag time phase (λ) derived from the modified Gompertz model. The modified Gompertz model based on one-substrate system can be used in fitting transformation kinetics of mixture substrate system. Our data suggest that degradation of phthalate diesters involves different enzymes in the hydrolysis of the two identical ester groups. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Dimethyl {{phthalate}} esters (DMPE) {{can easily}} be released into the environment from plastic products. As endocrine disruptors, DMPE mimic estrogenic activities in animals and humans. The metabolites of DMPE are suspected to cause even more serious health problems. Among the common sterilization techniques adopted {{in the study of}} DMPE degradation, the average loss of the parent DMPE compounds after autoclaving was as high as 21. 26 %. In contrast, the loss after 0. 2  μm filtration was significantly lower at 2. 28 %. It is suggested that filtration should be used over autoclaving for sterilizing DMPE. The environmental fate of DMPE under sulfate-reducing condition was simulated and studied in microcosm system. It was observed that dimethyl phthalate (DMP), <b>dimethyl</b> <b>isophthalate</b> (DMI) and dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) could not be mineralized {{over an extended period of}} 6  months, but with the transformation to the respective monomethyl phthalate and/or phthalic acid. The dominant species of microorganisms utilizing individual DMPE isomer as the sole carbon source were isolated and identified as facultative anaerobe Thauera sp., Xanthobacter sp. and Agrobacterium sp. for DMP, DMI and DMT, respectively. This study illustrates that the detrimental DMPE and their natural metabolites may accumulate in the sulfate-reducing environment. Accordingly, proper surveillance program should be devised to monitor both the parent compounds and degradation intermediates of DMPE in order to protect the aquatic ecosystem and human health. © 2007 Elsevier B.

40|$|Purpose: Dimethyl {{phthalate}} esters (DMPEs) are a {{group of}} plasticizers commonly detected in the environment with potential adverse human health impact. The degradation of DMPEs by fungal systems has been studied to a limited extent, particularly by yeasts. In this study, a basidiomycetous yeast Trichosporon DMI- 5 - 1 capable of degrading DMPEs was obtained and the degradation pathways were investigated. Results: A DMPE-degrading yeast was isolated from costal sediment by enrichment culture technique and was identified as Trichosporon sp. DMI- 5 - 1 based on microscopic morphology and 18 S rDNA sequence. Comparative investigations on biodegradation of three isomers of DMPEs, namely dimethyl phthalate (DMP), <b>dimethyl</b> <b>isophthalate</b> (DMI), and dimethyl terephthalate (DMT), were carried out with this yeast strain. Trichosporon sp. DMI- 5 - 1 could not mineralize DMPEs completely but transform them to respective monomethyl phthalate or phthalic acid. Biochemical degradation pathways for the three DMPE isomers by Trichosporon sp. DMI- 5 - 1 were apparently different. The yeast carried out one-step ester hydrolysis of DMP and DMI to respective monoesters (monomethyl phthalate and monomethyl isophthalate, respectively) and no further metabolism of these two monoesters. Meanwhile, DMT was transformed by the yeast to monomethyl terephthalate and subsequently to terephthalic acid by stepwise hydrolysis of the two ester bonds. Conclusions: This study shows that different catalytic processes {{are involved in the}} transformation of DMPEs by the basidiomycetous yeast Trichosporon sp. DMI- 5 - 1 and suggests that its esterases, responsible for the initial hydrolyzing the two ester bonds of DMPEs, are highly substrate specific. © 2011 Springer-Verlag. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

Poly(tetramethyleneoxide) (PTMO) is amorphous {{and has a}} low Tg. The segment length was varied from 650 to 2800 g/mol by extending PTMO 650 using <b>dimethyl</b> <b>isophthalate.</b> The polymers were synthesized in the melt, and test samples were prepared by injection molding. The melting behavior, {{as well as the}} torsion modulus spectrum as a function of temperature, were studied using DSC and DMA, respectively. The T 2 T-PTMO polymers were found to have sharp glass (Tg) and flow transitions (Tfl), and the modulus at the rubbery plateau appeared to be virtually temperature independent. The Tg value was found to be independent of the diamide concentration, thus indicating that the T 2 T segments were fully crystallized. The Tfl was found to decrease with increasing soft segment length; this was ascribed to a solvent effect of the amorphous phase of the crystalline T 2 T units. The difference between the melting and crystallization temperatures was found to be low, thus suggesting that on cooling, there is a high rate of crystallization. When ethanediol was added as a T 2 T segment extender, amide-ester-amide segments were introduced. These amide-ester-amide segments form a separate lamellar phase with a much higher melting temperature (> 300 °C). It was found that the crystallization rate of the T 2 T units was enhanced by the presence of the amide-ester-amide segments, indicating that upon cooling, the crystallized amide-ester-amide segments form the nucleation sites for the nonextended T 2 T segments...|$|E
40|$|A new {{route to}} the AB(_ 2) monomer {{dimethyl}} 5 -(2 -hydroxyethoxy) isophthalate and its subsequent polymerisation is reported. Hyperbranched polyesters were prepared by melt condensation polymerisation of the AB(_ 2) monomer and also by copolymerisation with suitable core molecules. Unusual molecular weight growth characteristics were demonstrated. The {{number average molecular weight}} (Mn) reached a plateau value after relatively short polymerisation time, whereas the weight average molecular weight (M(_n)) continued to increase. This limit to the attainable number average molecular weight is thought to be a consequence of intramolecular cyclisation reactions, evidence of which was provided by MALDI-TOF MS. The weight average molecular weight continues to increase after complete cyclisation and it is postulated that this is due to a redistribution of polymer chains by ester interchange reactions. The plausibility of the occurrence of ester exchange processes was demonstrated by the successful incorporation of a <b>dimethyl</b> <b>isophthalate</b> core molecule into a fully cyclised hyperbranched polyester. The amount of branching in the hyperbranched polyesters was in agreement with the theoretical value for a statistical distribution at high conversion, as determined by quantitative (^ 13) C NMR spectroscopy. The solution properties of the hyperbranched polyesters were studied and revealed these materials to be soluble in common organic solvents. Solutions of the hyperbranched polyesters had characteristically low intrinsic viscosities ([n]) and Mark-Houwink plots showed a linear relationship between log M(_w) and log[n]. The thermal properties of the hyperbranched polyesters were examined by differential scanning calorimetry, which showed the polymers to be amorphous materials exhibiting a glass transition temperature (T(_g)) but no melting point.

40|$|Degradation of <b>{{dimethyl}}</b> <b>isophthalate</b> (DMI) and {{dimethyl phthalate}} ester (DMPE) was investigated using microorganisms isolated from mangrove sediment of Hong Kong Mai Po Nature Reserve. One enrichment culture {{was capable of}} utilizing DMI as the sole source of carbon and energy, {{but none of the}} bacteria in the enrichment culture was capable of degrading DMI alone. In co-culture of two bacteria, degradation was observed proceeding through monomethyl isophthalate (MMI) ester and isophthalic acid (IPA) before the aromatic ring opening. Using DMI as the sole carbon and energy source, Klebsiella oxytoca Sc and Methylobacterium mesophilicum Sr degraded DMI through the biochemical cooperation. The initial hydrolytic reaction of the ester bond was by K oxytoca Sc and the next step of transformation was by M. mesophilicum Sr, and IPA was degraded by both of them. In another investigation, a novel bacterium, strain MPsc, was isolated for degradation of dimethyl phthalate ester (DMPE) also from the mangrove sediment. On the basis of phenotypic, biochemical and 16 S rDNA gene sequence analyses, the strain MPsc should be considered as a new bacterium at the genus level (8 % differences). This strain, together with a Rhodococcus zopfii isolated from the same mangrove sediment, was able to degrade DMPE aerobically. The consortium consisting of the two species degraded 450 mg/l DMPE within 3 days as the sole source of carbon and energy, but none of the individual species alone was able to transform DMPE. Furthermore, the biochemical degradation pathway proceeded through monomethyl phthalate (MMP), phthalic acid (PA) and then protocatechuate before aromatic ring cleavage. Our results suggest that degradation of complex organic compounds including DMI and DMPE may be carried out by several members of microorganisms working together in the natural environments...|$|E
40|$|NoThe work {{presented}} in this thesis consists of synthesis, characterization and biological screening of penicillin analogues. This work also describes the optimisation of a lead inhibitor of metallo-Ã¢-lactamases previously identified by fragment screening of a compound library. Keeping in view the wide spread of resistant strains of microorganisms there is an urgent need {{for the development of}} new antibacterial agents to treat the patients infected with multidrug resistant bacteria, we select 6 -aminopenicillinic acid (6 -APA) as a precursor for the synthesis of new penicillin analogues. These penicillin conjugates were prepared by acylation of 6 -APA with different acid chlorides in aqueous medium. A number of 4 -substituted benzoic acids were required for this work. Different substituted 4 -benzoylbenzoic acids were prepared form the appropriate substituted benzoic acids by regioselective Friedel-Crafts acylation of toluene promoted by phosphorus pentoxide adsorbed onto silica, followed by benzylic oxidation using Jones reagent in hot acetic acid. Starting with 4 -benzoylbenzoic acid, hydrogenolysis gave 4 -benzylbenzoic acid, while partial reduction with sodium borohydride gave the benzylic alcohol-acid. 3 -(4 -Methylbenzoyl) benzoic acid used in this work was prepared by the hydrolysis of <b>dimethyl</b> <b>isophthalate</b> to the monoacid which was then subjected to the Friedel-Crafts acylation with toluene and phosphorus pentoxide on silica gel to yield the methyl 3 -(4 -methylbenzoyl) benzoate. Finally, saponification of methyl 3 -(4 -methylbenzoyl) benzoate gave the required carboxylic acid. The monoacid ester of isophthalic acid was treated with pivalyl chloride and triethyl amine in dichloromethane which was then condensed with piperidine and pyrrolodin to get methyl 3 -(piperidine- 1 -carbonyl) benzoate and methyl 3 -(pyrrolodin- 1 -carbonyl) benzoate respectively. The saponification of these two esters was accomplished with LiOH. H 2 O in 30 % water methanol solution to give their respective carboxylic acids. The final carboxylic acids used in this work were synthesized by acetylation of 4 -hydroxybenzoic acid and 2 -hydroxybenzoic acid. Finally all these carboxylic acids were then converted to their respective acid chlorides for the acylation of 6 -APA. These penicillin analogues were then screened against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains for their antibacterial activity. These compounds were also screened against IMP- 1 metallo-Ã¢-lactamase. Briefly, kinetic studies were performed using the chromogenic substrate CENTA and a 96 -well plate reader at pH 7. 00 and monitoring the development of the chromophore 4 -nitrothiophenolate at 405 nm. We screened these penicillin conjugates too against fully reduced pig purple acid phosphatase (pPAP) using 5 mM PNPP as a substrate at pH 4. 9 with reduction time 132 - 264 sec. In this study we found out new biological activity associated with this class of compounds. During preliminary biological screening it was found that penicillin conjugates had significant inhibitory activity against pig PAP with Ki values as low as 12 Ã¬M. The interactions of the most potent inhibitors and the active site of imipenemase (IMP- 1), pig purple acid phosphatese (pPAP), and human purple acid phosphatese (hPAP) were examined using in silico docking methods. For the optimisation of a lead inhibitor of metallo-Ã¢-lactamases, 1, 2, 4 -Triazole- 3 -thiols were prepared in most cases from acylated thiosemicarbazides on treatment with strong base, either aqueous sodium hydroxide solution or sodium ethoxide in ethanol. Acylated thiosemicarbazides were prepared by a variety of methods, either direct thermal condensation of thiosemicarbazide with carboxylic acids or by acylation of thiosemicarbazide with acid chlorides or acid anhydrides. In some cases the intermediate acylated thiosemicarbazides could not be isolated, and the 1, 2, 4 -triazole- 3 -thiol products instead formed directly. A fortuitous discovery was that many of the acylated thiosemicarbazide synthetic precursors of the triazole-thiols did themselves possess high potencies against the IMP- 1 MBL with Ki values as low as 11 Ã¬M, comparable with the potency of already reported inhibitor captopril (Ki = 12. 5 Ã¬M) ...|$|E
