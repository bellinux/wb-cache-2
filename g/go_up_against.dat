25|$|This episode saw the Challenge's {{youngest}} competitor Sandy, <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> {{food writer}} Katie and lovable Ivan the posty. The signature dish round got the show {{off to a}} great start. Ivan prepared a unique combination of flavours with his rabbit thighs with mint pineapple. Sandy's spicy lamb served on a char grilled vegetable stack proved to the judges she was very accomplished behind the grill, despite her age. The always articulate Katie from Brisbane went for a cheaper option and whipped up some steak fajitas. Mark's screen test round belonged to Ivan who's theatrical training helped put him clearly {{in front of the}} competition. In the final round the kiddies were the judges and Ivan was declared the winner and Katie was given a second chance as a wild card.|$|E
25|$|The New York Times, however, {{reported}} that {{it was unlikely that}} NBC would get baseball, as the network would have to preempt up to three weeks of NFL coverage on Sunday nights. However, the NFL used to not schedule a Sunday night game on the second night of the World Series, which meant that NBC gaining the rights was not completely out of the question (however, the following Sunday, in which a possible World Series Game 7 is scheduled, a Sunday night NFL game is also scheduled). In addition to this, other Sunday playoff games, such as the ALCS and NLCS could be pushed to the afternoon. This might not be appetizing to league officials, as major playoff games would go up head-to-head against highly rated afternoon NFL games (as opposed to today's system, in which only one game out of two for the day would <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> network NFL broadcasts).|$|E

25|$|In 2004, Aerts left Mejiro Gym {{to found}} Team Aerts, {{training}} out of Kops Gym in Amsterdam under Henry Hooft and Jan Plas. After six {{months out of}} the ring, he returned against Gary Goodridge at the K-1 World Grand Prix 2004 in Nagoya on June 6, 2004. After withstanding the Trinidadian brawler's initial onslaught, Aerts brutalised Goodridge with low kicks over two and a half rounds. Although Goodridge was still game, he could barely stand and the referee stopped the fight in round three. Aerts then defeated Michael McDonald by unanimous decision (30-29, 30-29, 29-27) at the K-1 World Grand Prix 2004 Final Elimination on September 25, 2004 to qualify for the K-1 World GP final eight. The K-1 World Grand Prix 2004 Final, held on December 4, 2004, saw Aerts <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> South African boxer Francois Botha in the quarter-finals. Aerts lost in the first round when he could not continue after injuring his leg while low kicking Botha.|$|E

Velo loses again to the Earth racers and literally explodes in a bout of fury, revealing himself to be a robot suit controlled by a small gremlin-like version of himself.|$|E
500|$|Davis played {{through a}} {{shoulder}} injury early in the 1993 season. Defensive end Reggie White, who signed with the Green Bay Packers following the 1992 season after spending eight seasons with the Eagles and earned seven Pro Bowl selections, said that he believed he destroyed Davis' confidence as a rookie and second-year player, as Davis had to <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> White in practice every week. White said [...] "there are some guys who get very discouraged because they can't block you. I {{think that was the}} situation at times with Antone." [...] Davis, however, disputed White's statements as the Eagles played against the Packers in the second week of the season.

2500|$|With {{the help}} of a fairy known as Wanda (who can create bombs) and Birdo (who {{provides}} encouragement for Toad), Toad must rescue the Mushroom Kingdom from Wario's greed and power. When Toad's time bar runs out, Birdo is replaced by Wario, who occasionally lowers the ceiling, and Wanda is replaced by a pigeon, who spawns monsters insteadof bombs. Birdo and Wanda replace them after Toad's time bar runs out again, ad infinitum. Toad's job is to take the bombs and line them up with the enemies of the woods, to defeat Wario's monsters. If Toad clears enough monster-packed sections of the forest (including various mini-bosses), he'll <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> Wario himself. After defeating Wario the first time, it is then revealed to Toad that the villain that he had just defeated was a [...] "False Wario", and that the real Wario in the meantime had prepared for the final battle by inflating himself to a massive size. Upon defeating the real Wario, the antagonist soon shrinks back to his regular size and is soon chased out of the woods by the victorious Toad; thus, allowing peace to finally be restored to the woods. The ending to the SNES version of Wario's Woods is slightly different as it instead involves Toad destroying Wario's Castle {{through the use of a}} large bomb which as a result causes the castle to go crumbling down and puts an end to Wario's rule and spell over the Mushroom Kingdom and its inhabitants.|$|E
