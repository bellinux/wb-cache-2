40|$|Large area {{electrical}} system breakdowns (blackouts) cause economic losses and restoration {{is a major}} challenge for the transmission system operator. The precise situation cannot be predicted {{because it is not}} known in advance which particular thermal power plant might manage to switch into <b>house</b> <b>load</b> <b>operation</b> and which neighbouring system survived, thus being strong enough to support restoration. Due to these huge variances it is difficult to develop a precise restoration path in advance. Today decentralised generators based on wind, PV and biogas do not contribute to restoration processes. The functionality with which they could support it is still not known. Planning and analysis of restoration strategies is usually performed by the simulation of large {{electrical system}}s because experiments can rarely be conducted at the system. These simulations require dynamic mathematical models which represent the functions of all generators being involved. An analysis of historical blackouts and the causes that have brought upon the situation are presented, followed by some potential functions that wind energy generators could provide to system restoration, as well as results of analysis of the interactions between wind energy generators and thermal power plants during the process...|$|E

40|$|Diesel {{engines in}} {{generator}} configuration are normally optimized for operations at medium to high engine loads. It is suspected that <b>operations</b> at low <b>loads</b> may increase operational problems {{and thus the}} damage frequency. It is also suspected that negative effects off low <b>load</b> <b>operations</b> are aggravated by recent exhaust emission regulations issued by IMO. This thesis describes {{an investigation of the}} impacts of low <b>load</b> <b>operations</b> on modern four-stroke diesel engines in generator configuration. The problem has been approached by reviewing existing literature, studying damage cases, analysis of existing finding data and by assessing engine manufacturers experiences with low <b>load</b> <b>operations.</b> Low <b>load</b> <b>operations</b> of diesel engines are defined as engine operations below 40 % of maximum continuous rating. Low <b>load</b> <b>operations</b> are typical for, but not limited to, offshore vessels with dynamic positioning systems. Low <b>load</b> <b>operations</b> of diesel engines cause lower cylinder pressure and thus lower temperature. Low temperature can lead to ignition problems and poor combustion which causes increased soot formation and aggregation of unburned fuel in the cylinder. Low cylinder pressure, soot and unburned fuel deteriorate the piston ring sealing efficiency allowing hot combustion gases, soot particles and unburned fuel to leak past the piston rings. This results in increased lubricating oil consumption and dilution. Fuel dilution of the lubricating oil reduces the viscosity which can collapse critical oil film thicknesses. This can cause premature wear of pistons, rings, liners and crank case bearings. The mechanisms of low load lead to a cycle of degradation which means that diesel engines that run at low loads {{for longer periods of time}} can become irreversibly damaged. This is illustrated in this paper by an engine damage case. The damage case presents an engine crankcase breakage initially caused by piston scuffing from lubrication oil breakdown after excessive low <b>load</b> <b>operations.</b> Most modern diesel engines operate at lower cylinder pressure and thus lower temperatures to comply with stringent IMO NOX emission requirements. The IMO Tier I and II standards are met by primary measures which aim at reducing the amount of NOX formed during combustion by optimizing certain engine parameters. Modern NOX optimized engines are more exposed to low <b>load</b> <b>operations</b> than their predecessors due to initially lower cylinder pressures and temperatures. However, recent developments such as common rail, variable injection timing and variable valve control permit engine <b>operations</b> at lower <b>loads</b> than earlier. Existing finding data from DNV GL s database have been analysed to determine whether one can substantiate the impacts of low <b>load</b> <b>operations</b> quantitatively. The finding data have been analysed by simple frequency measurements. The results show higher finding frequencies for DP-vessels than non-DP vessels, which could indicate that low <b>load</b> <b>operations</b> may have a negative impact on the operational problems and thus the damage frequency. The finding data have also been evaluated with respect to time to determine whether NOX optimization aggravates the negative impacts of low <b>load</b> <b>operations.</b> The result showed generally higher finding frequencies for engines installed after 2000 than the ones installed prior to 2000. This could indicate that the introduction of Tier I compliant engines have increased operational problems. However, it could not be determined whether NOX optimized engines have aggravated the negative impacts of low <b>load</b> <b>operations.</b> Engine manufacturers that have been interviewed agree that low <b>load</b> <b>operations</b> affect the engine operation negatively, but they do not want confirm that low <b>load</b> <b>operation</b> increases the engine damage frequency. It is consensus among the engine manufacturers that the engines must be loaded to at least 50 % of rated power regularly during low <b>load</b> <b>operations</b> to prevent operational problems. The time interval and load requirements can vary from one engine to another and depending on the engine design...|$|R

40|$|The {{sugarcane}} {{transfer system}} comprises sugarcane being moved, loaded, transloaded and off-loaded, which amounts {{to more than}} 25 % of the total production cost of sugarcane, hence small adjustments can have significant economic benefits. The sugarcane <b>loading</b> <b>operation</b> {{has been identified as}} an inefficient and costly component as a consequence of poor management and the under-utilisation of equipment, making it a viable leverage point for improvement. This study evaluated consignment characteristics and investigated current <b>loading</b> <b>operations</b> in an attempt to generate best management guidelines. It was directed towards the handling of whole-stick loose sugarcane, which is loaded with grabloaders. The data collected comprised photographs of sugarcane consignments, along with the payload. These photographs were examined to identify the factors that need to be considered during the <b>loading</b> <b>operation.</b> These factors include cane bulk density, the degree of cane alignment and the design characteristics of the vehicle. Cane bulk density was calculated by dividing the payload by an estimated volume attained from photographs.

40|$|Gas turbine {{manufacturers}} typically use Equivalent Service Hours (ESH) or Equivalent Operating Hours (EOH) {{to specify}} {{inspection and maintenance}} intervals. One Equivalent Service Hour is equal to one hour of base <b>load</b> <b>operation</b> without water or steam injection. In order {{to account for the}} extra wear and tear of non-base <b>load</b> <b>operation,</b> gas turbine manufactures use multipliers of base <b>load</b> <b>operation</b> hours for startup, peak load, steam/water injection, and transients such as when a unit trips. PJM uses the terms of “cyclic peaking factor” for <b>operation</b> above base <b>load</b> and “cyclic starting factor ” for startups. Currently, cyclic peaking and starting factors are values specified in Manual 15 and are used to modify incremental maintenance dollars on combustion turbine units based on non-base <b>load</b> <b>operation</b> and incremental starts. Currently, cyclic peaking factors are 3. 0 for all combustion turbines (CTs). Cyclic starting factors are 5. 0 for aircraft-type CTs, and 10. 0 for industrial-type CTs and were based on a survey of manufacturers. These factors are used by generators as multipliers to include the incremental maintenance costs attributable to start costs and to peaking MWh in their cost offers.

40|$|According to {{the type}} of {{ancillary}} service provisioned, operation mode of a power plant may change to part <b>load</b> <b>operation.</b> In this contribution, part <b>load</b> <b>operation</b> is understood as delivering a lower power output than possible at given ambient temperature because of gas turbine power output control. If it is economically justified, a power plant may operate in the part load mode for longer time. Part load performance of a newly built 80 Â MW combined cycle in Slovakia was studied in order to assess the possibilities for fuel savings. Based on online monitoring data three possibilities were identified: condensate preheating by activation of the currently idle hot water section; change in steam condensing pressure regulation strategy; and the most important gas turbine inlet air preheating. It may seem to be in contradiction with the well proven concept of gas turbine inlet air cooling, which has however been developed for boosting the gas turbine cycles in full <b>load</b> <b>operation.</b> On the contrary, in a combined cycle in the part <b>load</b> <b>operation</b> mode, elevated inlet air temperature does not affect the part <b>load</b> <b>operation</b> of gas turbines but it causes more high pressure steam to be raised in HRSG, which leads to higher steam turbine power output. As a result, less fuel needs to be combusted in gas turbines in order to achieve the requested combined cycle's power output. By simultaneous application of all three proposals, more than a 2 % decrease in the power plant's natural gas consumption can be achieved with only minor capital expenses needed.

40|$|Abstract. Public bike sharing {{systems are}} {{important}} alternatives to motorized individual traffic and are gaining popularity in larger cities worldwide. In {{order to maintain}} user satisfaction, operators need to ac-tively rebalance the systems {{so that there are}} enough bikes available for rental as well as sufficient free slots for returning them at each station. This is done by a vehicle fleet that moves bikes among the stations. In a previous work we presented a variable neighborhood search metaheuris-tic for finding effective vehicle routes and three different auxiliary proce-dures to calculate <b>loading</b> <b>operations</b> for each candidate solution. For the most flexible auxiliary procedure based on LP, the current work provides a new, practically more efficient method for calculating proven optimal <b>loading</b> <b>operations</b> based on two maximum flow computations. The dif-ferent strategies for determining <b>loading</b> <b>operations</b> are further applied in combination controlled by an additional neighborhood structure. Exper-imental results indicate that this combined approach yields significantly better results than the original variable neighborhood search. ...|$|R

Lidar-assisted collective pitch control is a simple, but promising approach to reduce the rotor speed variation and structural loads for full <b>load</b> <b>operation.</b> This work extends this approach to the transition between partial and full <b>load</b> <b>operations.</b> A multivariable controller is presented, which provides a simple update for the generator torque rate and the minimum pitch angle based on a nonlinear system inversion.

Simulations with a full aero-elastic wind turbine model and a lidar simulator show improved rotor speed regulation and significant reduction of tower loads, while only slightly decreasing power. Further, possibilities to transform the load reduction into energy increase are outlined...|$|R
