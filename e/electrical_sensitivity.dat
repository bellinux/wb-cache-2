50|$|This article {{deals with}} the term as a {{measurement}} of a device's <b>electrical</b> <b>sensitivity</b> to light. In a charge-coupled device (CCD) it is the percentage of photons hitting the device's photoreactive surface that produce charge carriers. It is measured in electrons per photon or amps per watt. Since the energy of a photon is inversely proportional to its wavelength, QE is often measured over a range of different wavelengths to characterize a device's efficiency at each photon energy level. The QE for photons with energy below the band gap is zero. Photographic film typically has a QE of much less than 10%, while CCDs can have a QE of well over 90% at some wavelengths.|$|E

30|$|Lateral {{dimensions}} of the cantilever platform and thicknesses of the constituent layers are designed to meet specifications of mechanical stability, i.e., spring constant, resonant frequency, and <b>electrical</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> To ensure stability and compliance of the cantilever, the spring constant is typically chosen {{in the range from}} 0.1  ×  10 − 3 to 10  N m− 1, whereas to reduce the vulnerability of the sensor from external vibrational noise, the sensor is designed with resonant frequency more than 5  kHz. The lateral {{dimensions of}} the cantilever are also governed by factors like piezoresistor coverage area, sensor die size, etc. Compared to the typical thickness of solid-state semiconductor cantilevers (less than 1  µm), the thickness of SU- 8 cantilevers is kept more than 1  µm mainly to ensure mechanical stability of the cantilever platform. It may be noted that in all the devices mentioned, careful design is performed such that the distance between the mid-plane of piezoresistor and the neutral axis of the cantilever stack is maximum, thereby maximizing the <b>electrical</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> For instance, in most cases, the thickness of the structural layer is kept {{more than three times the}} isolation layer thickness.

The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the effects of high- and low-frequency electrical {{stimulation of the}} forearm on sensitivity to pressure–pain in the ipsilateral forehead, as inhibitory pain modulation may be stronger after low- than high-frequency electrical stimulation. Before and after high- and low-frequency <b>electrical</b> stimulation, <b>sensitivity</b> to heat and to blunt and sharp stimuli was assessed at and adjacent to the electrically conditioned site in the forearm. In addition, sensitivity to blunt pressure was measured bilaterally in the forehead.
