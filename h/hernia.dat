An azygos lobe is a congenital anatomical variation which though usually without effect can cause problems in thoracoscopic procedures.|$|E
5|$|During the 2011 off-season, Hamels {{underwent}} {{elbow and}} <b>hernia</b> surgeries. Hamels had missed scheduled starts in August {{due to a}} stiff shoulder, and loose bodies were removed from his elbow to fix his problems. Hamels was ready to pitch {{by the start of}} Spring training 2012.|$|E
30|$|These <b>hernias</b> can {{be either}} {{congenital}} or acquired. The major classifications of internal <b>hernias</b> include paraduodenal (53  %), pericecal (13  %) and transmesenteric <b>hernias</b> (8  %), <b>hernias</b> through the foramen of Winslow (8  %) and intersigmoid <b>hernias</b> (6  %) [2, 4].|$|R
40|$|Appendix-containing {{inguinal}} <b>hernias</b> {{are known}} as Amyand <b>hernias.</b> Traditionally, these <b>hernias</b> have been diagnosed at surgery but are increasingly diagnosed on abdominal computed tomography scans. The classification of Amyand <b>hernias</b> determines their subsequent surgical management; as such, {{it is important for}} the radiologist to be familiar with the appearances of the subtypes of Amyand <b>hernias.</b> Sarah Constantin...|$|R
40|$|Clinical {{differentiation}} of direct inguinal <b>hernias,</b> indirect inguinal <b>hernias,</b> femoral and Spigelian <b>hernias</b> {{can be difficult}} particularly with small <b>hernias</b> and in obese patients. Diagnostic imaging can detect and characterize <b>hernias</b> more reliably, allow better surgical planning and possibly even prevent unnecessary surgery. Detection of complications occurring in groin <b>hernias</b> is also of importance. Hernial incarceration is particularly evident on ultrasound (US) performed during rest and abdomimal straining (Valsalva maneuver) in both the supine and erect postures. Hernial strangulation is visible both with US and with computed tomography (CT) with fluid appearing around the hernial sac contents. peer-reviewe...|$|R
5|$|Back at city hall, Ron (Nick Offerman) remains {{immobile}} in {{his chair}} all day due to a <b>hernia</b> which causes excruciating pain if he moves. Ron remains immobile in his seat well into the night, until the janitors turn the lights off on him. The intern, April (Aubrey Plaza), returns to check on him, and wheels Ron {{out to the car}} on his office chair to bring him to the hospital.|$|E
5|$|For Arsenal, Thierry Henry was {{declared}} fit {{to start and}} played alongside Dennis Bergkamp up front. 17-year-old Cesc Fàbregas partnered Gilberto Silva in central midfield, with José Antonio Reyes and Jermaine Pennant providing width on either side. Manchester United were without seven of their first-team players, including Ruud van Nistelrooy, who required surgery on his <b>hernia.</b> Wes Brown and Louis Saha were also ruled out because of injury, so David Bellion and Eric Djemba-Djemba came into the first team.|$|E
5|$|John Horsefield died on 6 March 1854, aged 62, {{probably}} {{as a consequence}} of a strangulated <b>hernia</b> that had been masked by a tumour. He was buried on 10 March 1854 at the St. Mary's Church, Prestwich, although at some point in his life it seems that he had upset the authorities of the established church for reasons unknown. His table tomb was listed as a Grade II monument by English Heritage in 2012.|$|E

50|$|This {{technique}} has met particular {{success in the}} repair of bilateral <b>hernias,</b> large scrotal <b>hernias,</b> and recurrent or rerecurrent <b>hernias</b> in which conventional repair is difficult and carries a high morbidity and failure rate. The most recent reported recurrence rate (involving 230 patients with 420 <b>hernias</b> and a maximum of 8 years follow-up) was 0.71%.|$|R
50|$|Femoral <b>hernias,</b> {{like most}} other <b>hernias,</b> usually need {{operative}} intervention. This should ideally be done as an elective (non-emergency) procedure. However, {{because of the high}} incidence of complications, femoral <b>hernias</b> often need emergency surgery.|$|R
5|$|Nunn {{obtained}} {{the first eight}} years of his education in a one-room, one-teacher schoolhouse in Park. During his teenage years, he gave himself a <b>hernia</b> while lifting a heavy piece of farm equipment. This, combined with his father's health history, {{may have contributed to}} back pain issues that plagued him for most of his life. In 1938, he matriculated to Hiseville High School. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree at Bowling Green Business University, now Western Kentucky University.|$|E
5|$|Ryan {{underwent}} lap-band {{surgery at}} NYU Medical Center in March 2010 {{in an effort}} to battle his obesity. Ryan also had a <b>hernia</b> repaired during the procedure. He was able to return to his home that same day to recover. Following a three-week period, he had lost 40pounds and as of July 2012, Ryan had lost 106pounds.|$|E
5|$|During the 2013 season, Zakuani {{made only}} nine {{appearances}} across all competitions before being sidelined with a sports <b>hernia.</b> In that time, he recorded one assist in league play, and assisting in the game-winning goal against Mexico's Tigres UANL in the CONCACAF Champions League quarterfinals. He was later placed {{on injured reserve}} and twice underwent surgery {{on each side of}} his groin. Zakuani's contract was allowed to expire, effectively ending his five-year career with the Sounders, during which he started in 67 of 78 appearances in league play. At the time, he was the club’s third-leading scorer with 17 goals.|$|E
40|$|Most Morgagni and Bochdalek <b>hernias</b> {{are found}} and {{repaired}} in children, but 5 % {{are found in}} adults. Symptoms of these <b>hernias</b> are attributable to the involved viscera.

5|$|In the 2004–05 season Jarvis {{became a}} regular in the Gillingham first team, playing in 30Football League matches, {{although}} {{he was out of}} action for five weeks in January and February after undergoing an operation on a <b>hernia.</b> He also scored his first goal for the club in a win over Wolverhampton Wanderers on 30 October 2004. Gillingham, however, were relegated from the Championship {{at the end of the}} season. In the 2005–06 season he was again a regular, and scored seven goals, his best season tally to date.|$|E
5|$|Neighbours storylines {{frequently}} {{focus on}} family problems, intergenerational clashes, school problems, romances and domestic issues. Despite the restrictive 6:30pm time slot, Neighbours has also covered many serious {{problems such as}} teenage pregnancy, marital breakdown, imprisonment, career problems, financial problems, pregnancy, abortion, eating disorders, alcoholism, adultery, drug use and drug trafficking, robbery, stalking, kidnapping, accidental death, hit-and-runs, murder, shootings, stabbings, and incest. In the 2000s and 2010s, the show dealt with controversial issues such as homosexuality, gambling, prostitution, surrogacy, and exotic dancing. Health issues were also focused on, including multiple sclerosis, bipolar disorder, epilepsy, amnesia, congenital diaphragmatic <b>hernia,</b> and alzheimer's disease. In September 2014, the show featured a natural disaster storyline, in which a tornado descended on Erinsborough and Ramsay Street.|$|E
5|$|On August 10, 2012, U.S. Figure Skating {{announced}} that an agreement {{had been reached}} and Lysacek would return to competition at the 2012 Skate America. He withdrew after aggravating a groin injury. On November 20, 2012, Lysacek underwent surgery to repair a torn muscle in his lower abdomen, i.e. a sports <b>hernia,</b> with an expected period of six weeks off the ice. In January 2013, he withdrew from the 2013 U.S. Championships, saying he was healthy but needed an additional three weeks to return to competition form. Carroll {{said it would be}} a long recovery.|$|E

2500|$|Surgery is {{recommended}} for some types of <b>hernias</b> to prevent complications like obstruction of the bowel or strangulation of the tissue, although umbilical <b>hernias</b> and hiatus <b>hernias</b> may be watched, or are treated with medication. Most abdominal <b>hernias</b> can be surgically repaired, but surgery has complications. Time needed for recovery after treatment is reduced if <b>hernias</b> are operated on laparoscopically. However, open surgery can be done sometimes without general anesthesia. Uncomplicated <b>hernias</b> are principally repaired by pushing back, or [...] "reducing", the herniated tissue, and then mending the weakness in muscle tissue (an operation called herniorrhaphy). If complications have occurred, the surgeon will check {{the viability of the}} herniated organ and remove part of it if necessary.|$|R
5|$|On March 8, Maryse {{became the}} co-host of NXT, {{alongside}} Matt Striker. As part of NXT Redemption, Maryse {{was involved in}} several romantic storylines, most notably with Yoshi Tatsu, Lucky Cannon, and Hornswoggle. In April, DiBiase made an ultimatum to Maryse for her to choose to continue on the NXT or continue with him. The following week, Maryse chose to continue appearing on NXT, disbanding their alliance in the process. In August, Maryse underwent surgery for an abdominal <b>hernia</b> and took time off WWE programming. After two months of inactivity, Maryse was released from her WWE contract on October 28.|$|E
5|$|Trescothick ended some {{speculation}} about his international career by {{announcing that he}} would like to be considered for a place in the national side in the future. England's management staff continued to support him, and named him in the initial 25-man squad for the 2007 Test series against the West Indies. Having recovered from a double <b>hernia</b> operation, and proving himself fit for the start of the county season, Trescothick began his comeback to cricket by scoring 256 from 117 balls in a 50 over match against Devon on 8 April 2007, helping Somerset to 502–4 off their 50 overs.|$|E
5|$|A {{first team}} regular {{alongside}} defensive partners Neil Aspin and Dean Glover, in summer 1992 {{he helped the}} club to win the pre-season TNT Tournament. His performances in the 1992–93 season saw him awarded {{a place on the}} PFA Second Division team. He was man of the match in the League Trophy final victory over Stockport County – despite suffering from a double <b>hernia</b> and being hungover from a secret boozing session the night before. The season finished on a negative note though, {{in the second half of}} the 1993 Second Division play-off final against West Bromwich Albion, with the game still goalless, Swan was sent off after bringing down Bob Taylor – who was through on goal. This proved to the turning point in the game as West Brom went on to win 3–0 to secure promotion at Vale's expense. It also meant that he went down in history as only the third Englishman to be sent off at Wembley, after Kevin Keegan and Lee Dixon.|$|E
50|$|Femoral <b>hernias</b> occur {{just below}} the {{inguinal}} ligament, when abdominal contents pass through a naturally occurring weakness called the femoral canal. Femoral <b>hernias</b> are a relatively uncommon type, accounting for only 3% of all <b>hernias.</b> While femoral <b>hernias</b> can occur in both males and females, {{almost all of them}} develop in women because of the wider bone structure of the female pelvis. Femoral <b>hernias</b> are more common in adults than in children. Those that do occur in children {{are more likely to be}} associated with a connective tissue disorder or with conditions that increase intra-abdominal pressure. Seventy percent of pediatric cases of femoral <b>hernias</b> occur in infants under the age of one.|$|R

5|$|Bruce missed {{several weeks}} of the 1991–92 season when he {{underwent}} an operation on a longstanding <b>hernia</b> problem, in which Leeds United, after a season-long tussle, beat Manchester United to the championship by four points. Bruce helped United win their first-ever League Cup in April 1992, captaining the team in the final {{in place of the}} injured Bryan Robson. Injuries continued to take their toll upon Robson during the 1992–93 season, leading to Bruce captaining the team in the majority of United's matches during the first season of the new Premier League. Bruce scored two late goals in a win over Sheffield Wednesday which proved decisive in United winning the inaugural Premier League title, the first time the club had won the championship of English football since 1967, and he and Robson received the trophy jointly after the home victory over Blackburn Rovers on 3 May.|$|E
5|$|In January 1995, R.E.M. {{set out on}} {{its first}} tour in six years. The tour was a huge {{commercial}} success, but the period was difficult for the group. On March 1, Berry collapsed on stage during a performance in Lausanne, Switzerland, having suffered a brain aneurysm. He had surgery immediately and recovered fully within a month. Berry's aneurysm {{was only the beginning}} of a series of health problems that plagued the Monster tour. Mills had to undergo abdominal surgery to remove an intestinal adhesion in July; a month later, Stipe had to have an emergency surgery to repair a <b>hernia.</b> Despite all the problems, the group had recorded the bulk of a new album while on the road. The band brought along eight-track recorders to capture its shows, and used the recordings as the base elements for the album. The final three performances of the tour were filmed at the Omni Coliseum in Atlanta, Georgia and released in home video form as Road Movie.|$|E
5|$|Ingham agreed {{a move to}} League Two club Wrexham in May 2005 on {{a two-year}} contract, and the {{transfer}} was completed on 5 July when he signed the contract. He picked up a calf injury after returning to Wrexham, which saw him miss their match against Leyton Orient on 17 September 2005. He suffered another injury on his return against Macclesfield Town on 24 September 2005, which on this occasion was a groin problem. Ingham returned to fitness ahead of their 4–2 home victory over Torquay United on 15 October 2005. He finished 2005–06 with 43 appearances for Wrexham. He underwent an operation on a <b>hernia</b> in May 2006. Ingham made his final appearance of 2006–07 in Wrexham's 2–1 away defeat to Milton Keynes Dons on 17 March 2007, in which {{he picked up a}} hamstring injury. He later suffered from a virus in April 2007. He finished the season with 37 appearances, after which he was released by the club, due to his place in the team being taken by Anthony Williams.|$|E
