5|$|Students {{living on}} campus occupy a {{dormitory}} {{referred to as}} the , although its correct name is Astraea Dormitory, named after Astraea Hill. The building is a triangular shape, allowing for the segregation of students from the three schools; each section is about the same size. It was built about 100years before the story begins, around the same time that Miator was established, for students whose homes are far away. Each student is assigned a roommate in their year until graduation. If there <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> number of students enrolled in a given year, one of the new students must live alone until a student in their year transfers into their school.|$|E

In this factoring algorithm the discriminant Δ is chosen as a multiple of n, , where d is some positive multiplier. The algorithm expects that for one d there exist enough smooth forms in GΔ.

25|$|The {{function}} ℘ has two zeros (modulo periods) and {{the function}} ℘′ has three.

25|$|Note {{that on the}} {{interval}} AB there <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> number of borders colored 1-2 (simply because A is colored 1, B is colored 2; and as we move along AB, {{there must be an}} odd number of color changes in order to get different colors at the beginning and at the end). Therefore, the vertex of G corresponding to the outer area has an odd degree. But it is known (the handshaking lemma) that in a finite graph there is an even number of vertices with odd degree. Therefore, the remaining graph, excluding the outer area, has an odd number of vertices with odd degree corresponding to members of T.|$|E

25|$|An odd minor restricts this {{definition}} by adding parity conditions to these subtrees. If H {{is represented by}} a collection of subtrees of G as above, then H <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> minor of G whenever {{it is possible to}} assign two colors to the vertices of G {{in such a way that}} each edge of G within a subtree is properly colored (its endpoints have different colors) and each edge of G that represents an adjacency between two subtrees is monochromatic (both its endpoints are the same color). Unlike for the usual kind of graph minors, graphs with forbidden odd minors are not necessarily sparse. The Hadwiger conjecture, that k-chromatic graphs necessarily contain k-vertex complete graphs as minors, has also been studied from the point of view of odd minors.|$|E

The area was a small village that Ceaușescu attempted to convert into a lake. After demolishing the houses and building the concrete basin, the plan was abandoned following the 1989 revolution. For nearly two decades, the area shifted from being an abandoned green space where children could play and sunbathe, to being contested by previous owners of the land there, to being closed for redevelopment into a sports centre. The redevelopment deal failed, and over the following years, the green space grew into a unique habitat. In May 2016, the lake was declared a national park, the Văcărești Nature Park.|$|E
