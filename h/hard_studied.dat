[...] On 12 October 2006, Brown resigned from cabinet to make a second bid for leadership. [...] At a previously scheduled party delegates conference {{on the evening of}} 27 October, he defeated the incumbent, Scott, by 107 to 76, and was sworn in as Premier on 30 October.

60|$|Bradley {{had been}} made clerk. His capital {{handwriting}} and knowledge of book-keeping made him a valuable man for that work.

He felt paid for all his year's <b>hard</b> <b>study.</b>|$|R

6000|$|The two {{youths who}} were in {{juxtaposition}} at the rostrum were not to meet again. Daniel Wilson was ordained to the curacy of Chobham, under Mr. Cecil, an excellent master for impressing <b>hard</b> <b>study</b> on his curates. He writes: [...] "What should a young minister do? His office says, 'Go to your books, go to retirement, go to prayer.' 'No,' says the enthusiast, 'go to preach, go and be a witness.'" ...|$|R

60|$|So {{passed the}} {{preceding}} week, {{and with it}} his twenty-first birthday, spent very differently from {{the way in which}} it would ordinarily be passed by a youth in his position. It went by in <b>hard</b> <b>study</b> and sad musings, in bracing himself to a resolution that would cost him all he held dear, and, as the only means of so bracing himself, in trying to fix his gaze more steadily beyond the earth.|$|R
60|$|So the {{warnings}} were very gentle, {{and the good}} people waited anxiously to hear more of <b>hard</b> <b>study,</b> and less of 'splendid times'. Daisy sometimes wondered, with a pang of her faithful heart, {{if one of the}} charming Minnas, Hildegardes, and Lottchens mentioned were not stealing her Nat away from her; but she never asked, always wrote calmly and cheerfully, and looked in vain for any hint of change in the letters that were worn out with much reading.|$|R
60|$|That {{young lady}} was wonderfully {{improved}} by prosperity. She {{had lost her}} caustic manner and air of defiance, so that her cleverness and originality made her amusing instead of disagreeable. She piqued herself on taking her good fortune sensibly, and, though fully seventeen, professed not to know or care whether she was out or not, but threw herself into <b>hard</b> <b>study,</b> {{with a view to}} her classes, and gladly availed herself of Miss Ogilvie's knowledge of foreign languages.|$|R
60|$|Following {{the deeply}} rutted street, {{which had a}} narrow, plank sidewalk, they reached the Imperial Hotel--a {{somewhat}} pretentious, double-storied building of unpainted wood, with a veranda across the front. Here Gardner took the pony from them and gave them a room which had no furniture except a chair and two rickety iron beds. Before he left them he indicated a printed list {{of the things they}} were not allowed to do. <b>Harding</b> <b>studied</b> it with a sardonic smile.|$|R

40|$|Asian {{immigrants}} work <b>hard,</b> <b>study</b> <b>hard,</b> {{pay their}} taxes and don’t ask for welfare: {{this is how they}} are seen in the popular imagination in immigrant countries across the Western world. In short, they are the ‘model minority’ but it hasn’t always been this way. How does this apparently positive perception cover much internal difference within the ‘Asian’ community, and hide continuing discrimination asks Christina Ho in her review essay on Ellen Wu’s book The Color of Success: Asian Americans and the Origins of the Model Minority.

40|$|American policymakers {{are trying}} to deal with low {{standards}} and weak incentives for <b>hard</b> <b>study</b> by making students, staff, and schools more accountable for learning. The education departments of the 50 states have responded by developing content standards for core academic subjects, administering tests assessing this content to all students, publishing individual school results, and holding students and schools accountable for student achievement. While these efforts are generically referred to as standards-based reform, the mix of initiatives varies a great deal from state to state. Education...|$|R

50|$|<b>Harding</b> <b>studied</b> from 1893 to 1894 under Robert Henri at the Philadelphia School of Design for Women, {{where she}} won the George W. Childs gold medal and the Horstman Fellowship. The {{following}} year she was an instructor at the school. She received a fellowship and continued her studies at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts from 1894 to 1895 and under Howard Pyle at the Drexel Institute of Illustration from 1894 to 1900. Harding is identified as one of Pyle's first and noted students. Her works were exhibited at Drexel in 1897 and 1898, {{one of which was}} commissioned for a manuscript.|$|R

Tamon, a son of Osaka merchant, became a bureaucrat of Interior Ministry after his <b>hard</b> <b>study.</b> He was a Christian and learned Christianity under Kanzo Uchimura. Fusako, a daughter of raw silk trader in Gunma, received scholarship for five-year-study at girls' high school of Friends School (Japan) in Tokyo, that was established by Religious Society of Friends (Quaker), Fusako had English and Christian education there. Fusako was introduced Tamon from Inazo Nitobe and was married with Tamon in 1910.|$|R
60|$|On {{the other}} hand, all the real masters of {{caricature}} deserve honor in this respect, that their gift is peculiarly their own--innate and incommunicable. No teaching, no <b>hard</b> <b>study,</b> will ever enable {{other people to}} equal, in their several ways, the works of Leech or Cruikshank; whereas, the power of pure drawing is communicable, within certain limits, to every one who has good sight and industry. I do not, indeed, know how far, by devoting the attention to points of character, caricaturist skill may be laboriously attained; but certainly the power is, in the masters of the school, innate from their childhood.|$|R
60|$|The {{thought of}} the years he had wasted was very bitter. Looking back, he could see how fate had tricked him into {{throwing}} away his one talent. He had had promise. With hard work he could have become an artist, a professional--a man whose work was worth money in the open market. He had never had it in {{him to be a}} great artist, but he had had the facility which goes to make a good worker of the second class. He had it still. Given the time for <b>hard</b> <b>study,</b> it was still in him to take his proper place among painters.|$|R
