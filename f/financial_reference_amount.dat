40|$|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The {{research}} question {{addressed in this}} paper is how different <b>reference</b> <b>amounts</b> utilised in front of package nutrition labelling influence evaluation of product healthfulness. SUBJECTS/METHODS: A total of 13, 117 participants from six European countries (Germany, UK, Spain, France, Poland and Sweden) were recruited via online panels. A mixed between/within-subject factorial design was employed with food (biscuits, sandwiches, yogurts), healthfulness and presence of Guideline Daily Amounts as within-subjects factors and <b>reference</b> <b>amount</b> ('per 100 g', 'typical portion', 'half portion') and country as between-subjects factors. RESULTS: Overall, people correctly ranked foods according to their objective healthfulness as defined by risk nutrients alone, and could distinguish between more and less healthful variants of foods. General healthfulness associations with the three product categories {{do not appear to}} have had a strong influence on product ratings. This study shows that where the <b>reference</b> <b>amount</b> of 'per 100 g' {{is very different from the}} 'typical' portion size, as was the case for biscuits, products with a 'per 100 g' label are rated significantly less healthful than the 'typical' or 'half typical' portions. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that across the three food categories, consumers do factor the <b>reference</b> <b>amount,</b> that is, the quantity of food for which the nutritional information is being presented, into their judgements of healthfulness. Therefore, appropriate <b>reference</b> <b>amounts</b> are also of importance for the effective presentation of nutritional information...|$|R

40|$|The {{majority}} of decision-related {{research has focused}} on how the brain computes decisions over outcomes that are positive in expectation. However, much less is known about how the brain integrates information when all possible outcomes in a decision are negative. To study decision-making over negative outcomes, we used fMRI along with a task in which participants had to accept or reject 50 / 50 lotteries that could result in more or fewer electric shocks compared to a <b>reference</b> <b>amount.</b> We hypothesized that behaviorally, participants would treat fewer shocks from the <b>reference</b> <b>amount</b> as a gain, and more shocks from the <b>reference</b> <b>amount</b> as a loss. Furthermore, we hypothesized that this would be reflected by a greater BOLD response to the prospect of fewer shocks in regions typically associated with gain, including the ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). The behavioral data suggest that participants in our study viewed all outcomes as losses, despite our attempt to induce a status quo. We find that the ventral striatum showed an increase in BOLD response to better potential gambles (i. e. fewer expected shocks). This lends evidence to the idea that the ventral striatum is not solely responsible for reward processing but that it might also signal the relative value of an expected outcome or action, regardless of whether the outcome is entirely appetitive or aversive. We also find a greater response to worse gambles in regions previously associated with aversive valuation, suggesting an opposing but simultaneous valuation signal to that conveyed by the striatum...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Serving sizes on the Nutrition Facts table (NFt) on Canadian {{packaged}} foods {{have traditionally}} been unregulated and non-standardized. The federal government recently passed legislation to regulate the serving sizes listed on the NFt. The objective {{of this study was}} to compare the serving sizes on food product NFts to the recommendations in the 2003 Nutrition Labelling regulation (Schedule M) <b>reference</b> <b>amounts,</b> the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) ranges, and Canada’s Food Guide recommendations. An additional objective was to determine if food and beverage products that report smaller serving sizes have a higher calorie density, compared to similar products with a larger serving size. Methods Data for 10, 487 products were retrieved from the 2010 Food Label Information Program (FLIP) database and categorized according to Schedule M categories. Correlations between calorie density and manufacturer stated serving size were tested and the proportion of products meeting recommendations were tabulated. Results 35 % of products had serving sizes on the NFt that were smaller than the Schedule M <b>reference</b> <b>amount</b> and 23 % exceeded the <b>reference</b> <b>amount.</b> 86 % of products fell within the CFIA’s recommended serving size ranges; however, 70 % were within the lower-half of the range. Several bread and juice categories exceeded CFG’s recommendations, while several dairy product categories were smaller than the recommendations. Of the 50 Schedule M sub-categories analyzed, 31 (62 %) exhibited a negative correlation between serving size and calorie density. Conclusion While most products fell within the CFIA’s recommended serving size ranges, there was a tendency for products with a higher calorie density to list smaller serving sizes...|$|R

40|$|If {{you plan}} on using any words on your labels like “low-fat”, “sugar-free”, “a good source of”, etc., {{you should know that}} there are federal {{regulations}} that limit the kinds of claims you make and the context in which they may be used. Always check with an authoritative source on labeling to verify that the claims you are making are appropriate, correct, and allowed by regulations. Should you choose to make a nutrient or health claim on your label, you will be required to also provide a nutrition facts label. Businesses that have claimed exemption from nutrition facts labeling will lose their exemption status if they make a label claim. Nutrient Claims A nutrient claim is a claim on a food label that either implies or directly characterizes the level of a nutrient in the food (e. g., “low fat”, “high in fiber”, “Calorie free”). In order to make a specific nutrient claim, your food item must meet specific criteria that are allowable by the FDA. Nutrient content claims are based on the amount of food people usually eat or drink, which is known as a <b>reference</b> <b>amount.</b> A serving size and a <b>reference</b> <b>amount</b> are typically the same. However, they can be different. Most nutrient claims apply to the amount of nutrients available in the Daily Value. Daily Value is the percent of a nutrient provided by a serving of food based on a 2000 -calorie a day diet. Allowable Nutrient Claims were established by the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990. Table 1 lists synonyms that are allowed to be used in nutrient claims.
