This paper reports on the scientific approach of dental cutting of two dental ceramics using a high-speed electric handpiece and coarse diamond burs in simulated clinical conditions. Cutting characteristics (<b>forces,</b> <b>force</b> <b>ratios,</b> specific removal energy, surface roughness, and morphology) of feldspar and leucite glass ceramics were investigated as functions of the specific material removal rate, Qw and the maximum undeformed chip thickness, hmax. The results show that up and down cutting remarkably affected cutting <b>forces,</b> <b>force</b> <b>ratios,</b> and specific cutting energy but did not affect surface roughness and morphology. Down cutting resulted in much lower tangential and normal forces, and specific cutting energy, but higher <b>force</b> <b>ratios.</b> The cutting <b>forces</b> increased with the Qw and hmax while the specific cutting energy decreased with the Qw and hmax. The <b>force</b> <b>ratios</b> and surface roughness showed no correlations with the Qw and hmax. Surface morphology indicates that the machined surfaces contained plastically flowed and brittle fracture regions at any Qw and hmax. Better surface quality was achieved at the lower Qw and the smaller hmax.

The cutting force is monitored and obtained by installing the dynamometer on the turret of CNC turning machine. The relation between the cutting <b>force</b> <b>ratio</b> and the straightness is investigated under the various cutting conditions, which are the cutting speed, the feed rate, the depth of cut, the tool nose radius and the rake angle. The experimentally obtained results showed that the straightness can be improved with an increase in cutting speed, tool nose radius and rake angle. The relation between the dynamic cutting force and straightness profile can be proved by checking the frequency of the cutting force in frequency domain {{with the use of the}} Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which is the same as the straightness profile. Hence, the cutting <b>force</b> <b>ratio</b> can be used to predict the straightness during the cutting regardless of the cutting conditions.

There are objective factors, such as <b>force</b> <b>ratio,</b> and subjective factors, such as leadership, that affect battles.
