500|$|Sam is a laid-back but enthusiastic, brown-coated {{anthropomorphic}} [...] "canine shamus". He wears {{either a}} gray or blue {{suit with a}} matching fedora, to make people more cooperative when conversing with a six-foot talking dog. A warped sense of justice makes Sam the more passionate of the pair for their police work, only held back from taking his job seriously by Max. Nevertheless, he enjoys the mannerisms and dress that come with their line of work. Sam possesses near encyclopedic amounts of knowledge, particularly on obscure topics, and is prone to long-winded sentences filled with elaborate terminology. Although he is always keen to display this information—regardless of its accuracy—Sam can be capable of total ignorance towards more practical matters; for instance, despite his regard for his DeSoto Adventurer, he is severely negligent with the car's maintenance. Sam still retains various doglike qualities: he is excitable, enthusiastic but also susceptible to emotions of embarrassment and guilt. Nevertheless, Sam is [...] "not above sticking his <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> car window and letting his tongue flap in the breeze". Sam rarely loses his temper, {{and is able to}} react to panic-inducing situations with extreme calm. When he does get angry, Sam tends to react in a violent, uncharacteristically savage manner, in which case it is usually Max that calms him down and prevents him from acting upon his anger. Sam usually is armed with an oversized [...]44 revolver.|$|E

As {{they took the}} shell-bordered path to the beach he stuck his <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> door and called, [...] "Don't forget, gentlemen, at ten to-morrow old Parlay sells his pearls." ...|$|E
60|$|He arose {{and thrust}} his <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> port-hole, looking {{down into the}} milky wash. The Mariposa was deeply loaded, and, hanging by his hands, his feet {{would be in the}} water. He could slip in noiselessly. No one would hear. A smother of spray dashed up, wetting his face. It tasted salt on his lips, and the taste was good. He {{wondered}} if he ought to write a swan-song, but laughed the thought away. There was no time. He was too impatient to be gone.|$|E

60|$|But old Granny Fox didn't laugh--oh, my, no, indeed! Her heart went lower still, {{and she did}} {{her best}} to run faster. Pretty soon she came out {{on the top of the}} hill where she could look, and then it seemed as if her heart came right up in her mouth and stopped beating. Her eyes popped almost out of her head. There was Farmer Brown's boy {{standing}} right in front of the door of her home. And while she was watching, what should Reddy Fox do but stick his <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> door.|$|E
60|$|But he couldn't stop {{very long}} {{to make fun}} of poor Chatterer. In the first place Farmer Brown's boy had put his <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> barn door to see what all the fuss was about. In the second place, Sammy fairly ached all over to spread the news through the Green Forest and over the Green Meadows. You know he is a great gossip. And this was such unusual news. Sammy knew very well that no one would believe him. He knew that they just couldn't believe that smart Mr. Chatterer had really been caught. And no one did believe it.|$|E

[...] "Come in here, an' knocked over a box an' a basket, rushed {{up to the}} winder, an' the next thing I knew, he had planked down a lot o' money, an' when I stuck my <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> winder here, that feller pretended to grab up a ticket wot I didn't give him at all, an' took up his money and dusted out the door. At the same time while this was goin' on, 'nother feller had a light turned on this here winder wot nearly blinded me, and the feller with that funny lookin' camera was a-turnin' the crank to beat the cars!" ...|$|E

60|$|Reddy Fox {{wiped his}} eyes on his coat sleeve and hobbled along as best he could. Granny Fox would run a little way ahead {{to see that the}} way was safe and then come back for Reddy. Poor Reddy. He did his best not to complain, but it was such hard work. And somehow Reddy Fox didn't believe that it was at all necessary. He had been terribly frightened when he had disobeyed Granny Fox that {{afternoon}} and put his <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> door, only to look right into the freckled face of Farmer Brown's boy. He had ducked back out of sight again too quickly for Farmer Brown's boy to shoot, and now he couldn't see why old Granny Fox wanted to move that very night.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why," [...] said Cork McManus, {{pulling his}} ear, [...] "I'm the latest thing in suitings with side vents and bell skirt {{when it comes}} to escortin' a lady. You bet you'll find me all right, Ruby. And I'll give you a tip as to who I am. My {{governor}} is one of the hottest cross-buns of the Wall Street push. Morgan's cab horse casts a shoe every time the old man sticks his <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window. Me! Well, I'm in trainin' down the Street. The old man's goin' to put a seat on the Stock Exchange in my stockin' my next birthday. But it all sounds like a lemon to me. What I like is golf and yachtin' and--er--well, say a corkin' fast ten-round bout between welter-weights with walkin' gloves." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{time went}} by, and the suspense, to me, was terrible. Thomas Mugridge, {{on the other}} hand, {{considered}} it a laughable affair, and was continually bobbing his <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> galley door to make jocose remarks. How I hated him! And how my hatred for him grew and grew, during that fearful time, to cyclopean dimensions. For {{the first time in}} my life I experienced the desire to murder—“saw red,” as some of our picturesque writers phrase it. Life in general might still be sacred, but life in the particular case of Thomas Mugridge had become very profane indeed. I was frightened when I became conscious that I was seeing red, and the thought flashed through my mind: was I, too, becoming tainted by the brutality of my environment?—I, who even in the most flagrant crimes had denied the justice and righteousness of capital punishment? ...|$|E

5000|$|The bowler, not {{the cowboy}} hat or sombrero, {{was the most}} popular hat in the American West, {{prompting}} Lucius Beebe to call it [...] "the hat that won the West". Both cowboys and railroad workers preferred the hat because it would not blow off easily in strong wind while riding a horse, or when sticking one's <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window of a speeding train. It was worn by both lawmen and outlaws, including Bat Masterson, Butch Cassidy, Black Bart, and Billy the Kid. In America the hat came to be known commonly as the derby, and American outlaw Marion Hedgepeth was commonly referred to as [...] "the Derby Kid".|$|E

[...] "Callin' Moody Field" [...] was a regional rhythm and blues hit (Groove 0009).
