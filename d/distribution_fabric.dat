40|$|Shear flow of dense, non-Brownian {{suspensions}} is simulated {{using the}} discrete element method, taking particle contact and hydrodynamic lubrication into account. The resulting flow regimes are mapped in the parametric space of solid volume fraction, shear rate, fluid viscosity and particle stiffness. Below a critical volume fraction ϕ_c, the rheology {{is governed by}} the Stokes number, which distinguishes between viscous and inertial flow regimes. Above ϕ_c, a quasistatic regime exists for low and moderate shear rates. At very high shear rates, the ϕ dependence is lost and soft particle rheology is explored.

Transitions in microscopic phenomena such as inter-particle force <b>distribution,</b> <b>fabric</b> and correlation length are found to correspond to those in the macroscopic flow. Motivated by the bulk rheology, a constitutive model is proposed combining a viscous pressure term with a dry granular model presented by Chialvo, Sun and Sundaresan [Phys. Rev.

30|$|The {{phenomenon}} of levelness or unlevelness {{can be interpreted}} mainly by the homogeneity of the dye <b>distribution</b> on the <b>fabrics</b> dyed with the vegetable dyes. The reason behind the better levelness of the unmordanted samples was due to homogeneity of the dye <b>distribution</b> on the <b>fabric,</b> while non-homogenous <b>distribution</b> of the dyes can result in the greater ΔE values. In addition, ferrous sulphate as a transition metal mordant forms {{a large number of}} complexes with the dye molecules, mostly octahedral ones with coordination number 6. As a result, ferrous sulphate salts can form a ternary complex on one site with the fiber and in the other site with the dye, which resulted in slightly higher color difference.|$|R

Trill fulfills {{a combination}} of three requirements for a query processor to serve the diverse big data analytics space: (1) Query Model: Trill {{is based on a}} tempo-relational model that enables it to handle streaming and relational queries with early results, across the latency spectrum from real-time to offline; (2) Fabric and Language Integration: Trill is architected as a high-level language library that supports rich data-types and user libraries, and integrates well with existing <b>distribution</b> <b>fabrics</b> and applications; and (3) Performance: Trill’s throughput is high across the latency spectrum. For streaming data, Trill’s throughput is 2 - 4 orders of magnitude higher than comparable streaming engines. For offline relational queries, Trill’s throughput is comparable to a major modern commercial columnar DBMS. Trill uses a streaming batched-columnar data representation with a new dynamic compilation-based system architecture that addresses all these requirements. In this paper, we describe Trill’s new design and architecture, and report experimental results that demonstrate Trill’s high performance across diverse analytics scenarios. We also describe how Trill’s ability to support diverse analytics has resulted in its adoption across many usage scenarios at Microsoft. 1...|$|R

A model is derived by using membrane theory to analyse the stress <b>distributions</b> for isotropic <b>fabrics</b> under different boundary conditions, including consideration of different bagging heights and the friction between the fabric sample and the steel ball deforming the fabric. The results indicate that a non-uniform distribution of meridian stress and a non-continuous distribution of hoop stress, along with bagging height, are important factors that may influence residual-bagging deformation and may cause localised damage of the fabric. To investigate the influence of fabric anisotropy on the bagging behaviour of a <b>fabric,</b> the stress <b>distribution</b> of an anisotropic fabric is studied {{on the basis of the}} measurements of tensile moduli in seven directions by using fabric strips and of the fabric strain calculated from the relation between the geometrical deformation and bagging height of a fabric.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 50 years, {{experimental}} studies have repeatedly {{demonstrated that the}} mechanical behaviour of sand is sensitive to the material fabric, that is, {{the arrangement of the}} grains. Up until now there have been relatively few attempts to describe this fabric quantitatively. Much of our understanding of the link between the particle movements and interactions and the macro-scale response of granular materials, including sand, comes from discrete-element modelling and experiments on ‘analogue’ sands with simple, idealised shapes. This paper investigates methods of quantifying the directional fabric of a real sand and its evolution under loading. Statistical analyses of the <b>distribution</b> of <b>fabric</b> directional data in terms of particle, contact normal, branch vector and void orientations were carried out at different stages of shearing deformation. The data show that the initial particle orientation fabric that develops during the deposition of the material tends to persist during shearing, while in the post-peak regime the contact normals seem to be reoriented along the direction of the major principal stress. Different patterns were observed within the shear band, as both the particles and the contact normal vectors appeared to rotate along the shear plane...|$|R

The Middle Pliocene deposits around the Monte Cetona are represented by shallow-water marine carbonates rich in coralline red algae and bryozoans. These skeletal carbonates, characterising a coralline algaldominated factory, were analysed in terms of microfacies, taxonomy, and growth-forms of coralline red algal assemblage. Three microfacies were distinguished on the basis of component <b>distribution</b> and <b>fabric</b> analysis: coralline algal rudstones, coralline algal floatstones, and bioclastic packstones. Skeletal components are commonly abraded, bioeroded, and encrusted. The shallow-water skeletal carbonates are strongly bioturbated and any primary sedimentary structure is obliterated. The distribution of the coralline growth-forms suggests a decreasing hydrodynamic gradient from the coralline algal rudstone, through the coralline algal floatstone to the bioclastic packstone microfacies. The coralline algal flora consists of eight species representing the subfamilies Lithophylloideae, Mastophoroideae and Melobesioideae. The assemblage is dominated by lithophylloids. Other biogenic components are bryozoans, barnacles, echinoderms, and benthic foraminifera.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the interface of geogrid reinforced subballast through a series of large-scale direct shear tests and discrete element modelling. Direct shear tests were carried out for subballast with and without geogrid inclusions under varying normal stresses of σn = 6. 7 to 45 kPa. Numerical modelling with three-dimensional discrete element method (DEM) was used to study the shear behaviour of the interface of subballast reinforced by geogrids. In this study, groups of 25 - 50 spherical balls are clumped together in appropriate sizes to simulate angular subballast grains, while the geogrid is modelled by bonding small spheres together to form the desired grid geometry and apertures. The calculated results of the shear stress ratio versus shear strain show a good agreement with the experimental data, indicating that the DEM model can capture the interface behaviour of subballast reinforced by geogrids. A micromechanical analysis has also been carried out to examine how the contact force <b>distributions</b> and <b>fabric</b> anisotropy evolve during shearing. This study shows that the shear strength of the interface is governed by the geogrid characteristics (i. e. their geometry and opening apertures). Of the three types of geogrid tested, triaxial geogrid (triangular apertures) exhibits higher interface shear strength than the biaxial geogrids; and this is believed due to multi-directional load distribution of the triaxial geogrid...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Porous {{structure}} of fabric {{has a significant}} impact on the fabric functions such as air permeability, water transport and heat retention. In this article, six knitted fabrics with different blend ratio of cotton-like modified polyester fiber and cotton fiber were prepared. Pore sizes and its <b>distribution</b> of the <b>fabrics</b> were measured by CFP- 1100 -AI pore diameter tester. Porosity of the fabrics was obtained by three ways respectively, namely loop model method, image method and density method. The results show that the pore diameter of blended knitted fabrics presents an asymmetric distribution, that is, the smaller pores have a greater proportion to the total pores than larger pores. There exists an obvious diameter change in the pore size distribution which indicates the transition from intra-yarn pores to inter-yarn pores. Among the 3 test methods for porosity, the porosity obtained by the image method is much smaller than that of loop model method and density method, but its relationship to the fiber blending ratio is consistent with the variation law of fabric air permeability, which indicates intra-loop pores takes greater impact on air permeability of fabrics.

Graphic struc-tural logs, compiled from a consistently acquired data set, show the distribution of structural features margin by margin, and allow comparisons to be drawn between margins. Most sediments cored in forearcs are in situ slope deposits, and bedding dips constitute a fundamental strain indicator.

Notable results were: 1) Potassium and nitrate movement in the medium was slower than would occur by diffusion in water; therefore, movement {{can be explained by}} diffusion alone. Lack of visible water-stress symptoms, plant height, and shoot dry weights and fresh weights indicate that water flow rates were adequate to meet the demand of plant transpiration. Populations of T. harzianum increased with increasing concentrations of K⁺ and NO₃, and populations were higher when a corn plant was present. 2) A nonwoven polypropylene fabric container physically prevented root penetration, and reduced, but did not eliminate root circling. A Cu(OH) ₂-latex paint suspension applied to the fabric containers increased root density, and improved root <b>distribution.</b> Neither the <b>fabric</b> container nor the copper treatment had an adverse effect on plant growth. 3) Treating fabric root pouches with either copper treatment, Spinout or Texcide, significantly increased the percentage of corn root length colonized by the VA endomycorrhizal fungus Glomus intraradix without adversely affecting plant shoot growth. Both copper treatments significantly increased the root density and root distribution in the pouches...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Long-lasting insecticidal {{mosquito}} nets (LLINs) {{are highly}} effective for malaria prevention. However, {{it is also}} clear that durability monitoring is essential to predict when, post-distribution, a net population, no longer meets minimum WHO standards and needs to be replaced. Following a national distribution campaign in 2013, we tracked two durability indicators, physical integrity and bio-efficacy at six and 12 months post-distribution. While the loss of net integrity during this period was in line with expectations for a one-year net life, bio-efficacy results suggested that nets were losing insecticidal effect faster than expected. The rate of bio-efficacy loss varied significantly between different net brands. Methods We tested 600 randomly selected LLINs, 200 from each of three net brands. Each brand came from different eco-epidemiological zones reflecting the original <b>distribution</b> scheme. <b>Fabric</b> integrity (size and number of holes) was quantified using the proportional hole index (pHI). A subsample of the nets, 134 new nets, 150 at six months and 124 at 12 months, were then tested for bio-efficacy using the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended method. Results Three net types, Netprotect®, Royalsentry® and Yorkool®, were followed. After six months, 54 %, 39 % and 45 %, respectively, showed visible loss of integrity. The median pHI by type was estimated to be one, zero and one respectively. The percentage of damaged nets increased after 12 months such that 83. 5 %, 74 % and 68. 5 %, had holes. The median pHI for each brand of nets was 47. 5, 47 and 23. No significant difference in the estimated pHI at either six or 12 months was observed. There was a statistically significant difference in the proportion of hole size category between the three brands (χ 2 = 15. 761, df = 4, P = 0. 003).  In cone bio-assays, mortality of new Yorkool® nets was surprisingly low (48. 6 %), mortality was 90. 2 % and 91. 3 % for Netprotect® and Royalsentry® (F (2, 131)  = 81. 59, P < 0. 0001), respectively. At 12 month use, all tested nets were below the WHO threshold for replacement. Conclusion These findings suggest that there is a need for better net quality control before distribution. More frequent replacement of LLINs is probably not an option programmatically. Regardless of prior approval, LLIN durability monitoring for quality assessment as well as net loss following distribution is necessary to improve malaria control efforts...|$|R
