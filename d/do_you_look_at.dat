6000|$|... "Then what--Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> {{me in that}} fashion, sir?" [...] and {{springing}} up, Adrian rushed forward, {{and held}} the candle to Amyas's face.|$|E
6000|$|... "We think not," [...] {{answered}} Godwin; [...] "we are {{not worthy}} of such high company. But, lady, why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> us so strangely?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You will be soon able {{to judge}} of that," [...] said Lord Etherington; [...] "and now, off with you--Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me so anxiously?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> not <b>look</b> <b>at</b> that as <b>you</b> have <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> so many {{physical}} difficulties--the {{running of}} a survey, for instance?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Sandy (drops {{glass on}} table, hurries to centre, and seizes DONA JOVITA). Eh! Wot name <b>did</b> <b>you</b> say? (<b>Looks</b> <b>at</b> her amazed and bewildered.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} you, Serpent, and I understood Hist. Sometimes I think I'm {{not half}} as feeble minded {{as they say}} I am. Now, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> up <b>at</b> the roof, and I'll tell you all. But you frighten me, <b>you</b> <b>look</b> so eager when I speak of Hist." ...|$|R
6000|$|And He {{followed}} {{swiftly and}} touched {{the hand of the}} young man and said to him, 'Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> this woman and in such wise?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me so, Mr. Lee?" [...] she asked, with {{a slight}} smile. [...] "I believe {{something}} HAS happened. Mr. Falkner HAS brought you some intelligence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Communicate it to her--the poor dear! {{who would}} be so cruel as to give her pain?" [...] asked the {{innocent}} Duchesse. [...] "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me so, Frank?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Admirable! You are {{a pattern}} witness, Mr. Buckstone. How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> happen to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> your watch at that {{particular}} moment?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> so sorrowfully <b>at</b> me?" [...] asked Hilda, quietly {{meeting his}} {{disturbed}} gaze. [...] "What {{would you say}} to me? I love the white light too!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look <b>at</b> the {{mischief}} <b>you</b> <b>done!</b> <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> the way <b>you</b> smashed up New York--the {{people you}} killed, {{the stuff you}} wasted. Can't you learn?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why did {{you come}} here?" [...] she cried. [...] "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me like that? It is no concern of yours who I am. Why do you interfere?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The old {{man looked}} at him, and {{one side of his}} face became drawn up in a smile, which seemed to Mr. Lavender so horrible that he said: [...] "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me like that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Boys {{ought to}} keep their faces clean," [...] said Mr. Green, impressively; [...] "there’s nothing more {{unpleasant}} than a face what wants washing. You don’t want to grow up like that, <b>do</b> <b>you?</b> <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> it, Joe." ...|$|E
6000|$|Ashurst's lips twitched. Garton {{seemed to}} him an ass just then. Subtle study! She was a wild flower. A {{creature}} it <b>did</b> <b>you</b> good to <b>look</b> <b>at.</b> Study! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There!" [...] said Cissy, {{when they}} had passed, [...] "didn't I tell you? Did you ever see such conceit in your born days? I hope <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him." ...|$|R
5000|$|Des kôsch fei net macha! (Swabian) = Das kannst du (eigentlich wirklich) nicht machen. (<b>You</b> cant <b>do</b> that! / If <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it, <b>you</b> really cant <b>do</b> that. / <b>You</b> cant, I should think, do that.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Ah, Jack,' she said, 'I {{have just}} been in to see if I can be of any {{assistance}} to our new neighbors. Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me like that, Jack? You are not angry with me?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No!" [...] said Marion, {{standing}} up suddenly,--by no means smiling as she spoke! [...] "It {{is not to}} be. Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me like that, Mrs. Roden? Did I not tell you before you went that it should never be so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|SYBIL. One of them {{is married}} now, isn't he? [Still there is no answer; MAGGIE {{continues}} looking at her, and shivers slightly.] Have they travelled from Scotland to-day? Mrs. Shand, why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me so? The door did open! [MAGGIE nods.] What are you to do? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Miss Nugent {{says that}} you set {{everything}} right that <b>you</b> <b>do</b> but <b>look</b> <b>at,</b> Mr. Dutton,' she said; 'so {{we are prepared to}} receive you as a good genius to help us out of our tangle.' ...|$|R
6000|$|BLUNTSCHLI (with a boyish laugh of delight). That'll <b>do.</b> Thank <b>you.</b> (<b>Looks</b> <b>at</b> {{his watch}} and {{suddenly}} becomes businesslike.) Time's up, Major. You've managed those regiments so well that you are sure {{to be asked to}} get rid of some of the Infantry of the Teemok division. Send them home by way of Lom Palanka. Saranoff: don't get married until I come back: I shall be here punctually at five in the evening on Tuesday fortnight. Gracious ladies--good evening. (He makes them a military bow, and goes.) ...|$|R
5000|$|... "You don't {{know when}} it's good or bad. You really don't know, because you don't know what we're trying to <b>do,</b> <b>you</b> guys don't <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the films. <b>You</b> don't know what happened. You really don't know. You think you know, but you don't know. And you never will." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not I!" [...] he answered. [...] "This {{place is}} far too fascinating. Can't we have some more wine? This is my treat. And, Pritchard, why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me like that? You are not supposing {{for a moment that}} I am capable of making an ass of myself again?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Without ceasing to {{converse}} with Mr. Purcey and Signor Egregio Pozzi, she moved her left eye upwards. Mrs. Tallents Smallpeace understood this to mean: 'Be frank, and guarded!' Stephen, however, interpreted it otherwise. To him it signified: 'What the deuce <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me for?' And he felt justly hurt. He therefore said abruptly: ...|$|E
6000|$|V. [...] Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me, Annie? {{you think}} I am hard [...] and cold; [...] But all my {{children}} have gone before me, I am so [...] old: [...] I cannot weep for Willy, nor can I weep for the [...] rest; [...] Only at your age, Annie, I could have wept with the [...] best.|$|E
30|$|One {{would have}} to be very careful not to {{attribute}} the decline to Tagmemics itself, or at least only partly, because at the time the context was that of the dominant generative linguistics at the time. Their interest in language was so different from Pike’s that they didn’t engage with him, and they didn’t understand the importance of his contributions. But other folks <b>did.</b> If <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the introduction or forward to Talmy Givón’s 1979 book, On Understanding Grammar, there he cites Pike as one of the key influential linguists together with Bolinger. But certainly, he emphasized the importance of Pike’s work.|$|R
2500|$|On March 23, 2008, Breslow was claimed off {{outright}} waivers [...] by the Cleveland Indians and {{was added}} to the 40-man roster. Breslow was out of minor league options, so the Indians had to keep him on their big league club out of camp, or expose him to waivers again. Breslow won the final spot on the Indians' Opening Day roster. [...] "He's strong", Cleveland manager Eric Wedge said. [...] "I {{want to be able to}} use him two innings. He's <b>done</b> that—if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> his innings pitched the last couple of years versus appearances." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is it? Then I am {{in a bad}} way. Oh dear, oh dear, what a fool I am! What {{an idiot}} I've been! Fanny, I don't think I can stay here; and I do so wish I'd never come. I do--I do--I <b>do,</b> though <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me so horribly," [...] and jumping up she threw herself into her sister-in-law's arms and began kissing her violently. [...] "Don't pretend to be wounded, for you know that I love you. You know that I could live with you all my life, and think you were perfect--as you are; but--" ...|$|R
6000|$|CLEOPATRA (in mortal {{dread of}} him, {{but with her}} utmost cajolery). Nothing, dearest Caesar. (With sickly sweetness, her voice almost failing) Nothing. I am innocent. (She {{approaches}} him affectionately) Dear Caesar: are you angry with me? Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me so? I have been here with you all the time. How can I know what has happened? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'This is an attack, I suppose,' {{returned}} her mother coldly, 'on poor, unfortunate what's-his-name--Mr Carker! Your want of self-respect and confidence, my dear, {{in reference to}} that person (who is very agreeable, it strikes me), {{is not likely to}} have much effect on your establishment. Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me so hard? Are you ill?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{very little}} about Henry that need puzzle any one," [...] she complained bitterly. [...] "He is just an overgrown, spoilt child, devoted to amusements, and {{following}} his fancy wherever it leads him. Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me, Mr. Lessingham, as though you thought I was keeping something back? I am not, I can assure you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "An occurrence," [...] he declared, [...] "which no {{one could}} regret so greatly as myself. But apart from that, Lady Marrabel, I am afraid {{that you are not}} {{prepared}} to <b>do</b> me justice. <b>You</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me through Rochester's eyes, and I am quite sure that all his days Rochester will believe that I am more or less of a charlatan." ...|$|R
6000|$|Roland {{shut off}} the current and opened the screen. [...] "Come here, Margaret," [...] he said; [...] "this is the spot upon which the light was shining. I think it will <b>do</b> <b>you</b> good to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it. Tread upon it; it will help to reassure you that the things about us are real." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{on earth}} <b>do</b> <b>you</b> want to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> them for, Francis? You {{certainly}} {{are the most}} curious fellow I ever met. You scoffed at me when I said I should like to go up Mount Etna, and now here you are, dragging me along this cliff, just to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> some rocks of no possible interest to any one." ...|$|R
