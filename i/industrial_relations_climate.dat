40|$|There is an {{increased}} awareness of <b>industrial</b> <b>relations</b> <b>climate</b> as an index of labour-management relations. Yet there are conceptual and methodological problems associated with this topic. Consequently, in the present article a model of <b>industrial</b> <b>relations</b> <b>climate</b> is proposed that focuses on six central components of in-company industrial relations, namely, industrial relations policy, supervision, worker representation, grievance procedures, disciplinary procedures, and organizational communications. The In-Company <b>Industrial</b> <b>Relations</b> <b>Climate</b> Scale (IIRCS) is then developed. The scale consists of six, five-item sub-scales, designed to assess perceptions of the six components of the <b>industrial</b> <b>relations</b> <b>climate</b> model. Based on studies among 1 950 members of three South African mines (gold, diamond and platinum, respectively), satisfactory internal and temporal consistency was found. Factor analyses confirmed the six-factor structure of the IlRCS for all three samples. The IlRCS also displayed acceptable criterion-related validity. Future research priorities for the IlRCS and <b>industrial</b> <b>relations</b> <b>climate</b> in general are reviewed.

40|$|Research problem: Various {{factors which}} {{influence}} <b>industrial</b> <b>relations</b> <b>climate</b> {{can be classified}} as input variables (Dastmalchian, Adamason and Blyton, 1991). The <b>industrial</b> <b>relations</b> <b>climate</b> (IRC) in turn {{has the potential to}} positive or negatively influence and be influenced by the industrial relations outcomes of the organisation such as labour turnover, industrial action and productivity. Management therefore {{need to be aware of}} the prevailing IRC as well as the factors influencing the prevailing <b>industrial</b> <b>relations</b> <b>climate</b> so as to take the necessary and relevant measures and steps to improve the labour-management relations. Research objectives: The research objectives for addressing the research problem were mainly to ascertain the prevailing labour relations climate within the selected mine. The second objective was to identify the factors that shape labour relations climate and thirdly to establish the impact of the prevailing <b>industrial</b> <b>relations</b> <b>climate</b> within the mine Research questions: Research questions for the study were developed and were; What is the overall labour relations climate? What is the contribution of each of the five dimensions to the overall labour relations climate? What is the relationship between the subgroups, distinguished by union affiliation and occupational level? What is the relationship between the sub-groups, distinguished by gender, age, race years in organization, full-time or part-time, union affiliation, years in union, union status, occupational level, educational level and the five dimensions of the labour relations climate? What are the factors that shape the <b>industrial</b> <b>relations</b> <b>climate</b> with particular reference to the following factors such as the organisational context and background, the structure of the organisation, the Human Resources context, the Industrial Relations context and Industrial relations outcomes? Research design: The study was descriptive research and both qualitative and quantitative methods were used in order to address the objectives of the study. A self-administered survey questionnaire was used to collect quantitative data and in-depth semi-structured face-to-face interviews were also used to collect data relating to the IRC and the factors influencing the <b>industrial</b> <b>relations</b> <b>climate.</b> Human Resources records and reports were also used to provide secondary data for industrial relations outcomes. Major findings: The results from the study revealed that overall a negative IRC prevailed within the mine. This also applied to the five dimensions of climate that were measured. It was found that there was agreement between the unionised and the non-unionised employees’ perceptions of the <b>industrial</b> <b>relations</b> <b>climate</b> and similarly, when the miners’ perception of climate was compared with the more managerial group. The only really significant difference in perception was that management felt that the climate was fairer than did the miners. The results also revealed that the organisational environment and structure and the human resources and industrial relations contexts were consistent with the literature descriptions of an organisational environment that would inhibit a positive <b>industrial</b> <b>relations</b> <b>climate.</b> The results for the organisational outcomes, in particular absenteeism and turnover were also found to be consistent with those of organisations were the prevailing <b>industrial</b> <b>relations</b> <b>climate</b> was negative. The results also revealed that organisational age, size, ownership, structure, formalisation, decision-making, labour market, union-management consultation, communication were influenced and shaped the prevailing IRC.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{evidence}} for trade union renewal in the UK fire service. Its aim is to consider two main questions: "How have union-management relations and the <b>industrial</b> <b>relations</b> <b>climate</b> been affected by management reforms?" and "To the extent that there is deterioration in the IR climate, has this had an effect on union leadership style and also on union commitment and participation amongst ordinary members?" Design/methodology/approach: The paper draws on interviews with managers and union representatives and a survey of firefighters in the north of England. Findings: The research finds that a marked deterioration in the <b>industrial</b> <b>relations</b> <b>climate</b> led to changes in union leadership and to an increase in union commitment and participation amongst ordinary members. The poor climate created the conditions for union renewal by bringing forward union activists with more inclusive styles and by raising membership awareness of the need to vigorously defend their existing terms and conditions. Research limitations/implications: There is a research gap in the industrial relations literature on how <b>industrial</b> <b>relations</b> <b>climate</b> impacts on the renewal of workplace trade unionism.

40|$|Using {{survey data}} from a UK fire service, this article {{examines}} the antecedents of members’ intent to participate in their union. The authors identify three dimensions of intent to participate – in rankandfile activities, in militant activitiesand in standing for union office.

Affective union commitment itself reflects solidaristic prounion beliefs and instrumental union commitment, providing some support for interactionist and rational choice theories. There is also evidence of frustration–aggression effects, with perceived <b>industrial</b> <b>relations</b> <b>climate</b> and pay equity having negative direct effects on intent to participate.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{sets out}} to explore the roots of trade union members’ job dissatisfaction, as {{a large body of}} prior quantitative research, spanning more than four decades, indicates that trade union members express higher levels of job dissatisfaction than non-union members. <b>Industrial</b> <b>relations</b> scholars {{have not been able to}} agree on an explanation as to why trade union members express comparatively more job dissatisfaction. The ambiguity in establishing a causal relationship between trade union membership and job dissatisfaction is due to the fact that previous works have largely been biased towards the use of quantitative methods. The present study, therefore, uses a unique qualitative approach consisting of grounded theoretical techniques and interviews with 43 trade union members to gather new insights on the topic. Interviews were conducted at two case study organisations, one a manufacturer and the other a public services organisation, in Scotland. Three alternative explanations that have sought to explain trade union members’ job dissatisfaction were unpacked. These explanations link trade union members’ job dissatisfaction to (i) unmet expectations from trade union membership, (ii) awareness of inequalities and (ii) <b>industrial</b> <b>relations</b> <b>climates.</b> The aim of this dissertation was to develop insights to enable a better understanding of why trade union members appear to express dissatisfaction with their jobs. The grounded theoretical approach has enabled at least three contributions to the <b>industrial</b> <b>relations</b> literatures and, to a lesser extent, to the human resources and job satisfaction literatures. These contributions are: (i) a deep, qualitative approach towards understanding the phenomenon; (ii) a critical evaluation of three alternative explanations of the phenomenon; and (iii) insights towards an initial model explaining the roots of trade union members’ job dissatisfaction...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} the internal dynamics of white collar trade union branches {{in the public}} sector. The effects {{of a number of}} internal and external factors on branch patterns of action are evaluated. For the purposes of the study branch action is taken to be the approach to issues of job regulation, as expressed along the five dimensions of dependence on the outside trade union, focus in issues adopted, initiation of issues, intensity of action in issue pursuit and representativeness. The setting chosen for the study is four branches drawn from the same geographical area of the National and Local Government Officers Association. Branches were selected to give a variety in industry settings while controlling for the potentially influential variables of branch size, density of trade union membership and possession of exclusive representational rights in the employing organisation. Identical methods of data collection were used for each branch. The principal findings of the study are that the framework of national agreements and industry collective bargaining structures are strongly related to the <b>industrial</b> <b>relations</b> <b>climate</b> in the employing organisation and the structures of representation within the branch. Where agreements and collective bargaining structures formally restrict branch job regulation roles, there is a degree of devolution of bargaining authority from branch level negotiators to autonomous shop stewards at workplace level. In these circumstances <b>industrial</b> <b>relations</b> <b>climate</b> is characterised by a degree of informality in relationships between management and trade union activists.

A {{review of the literature}} revealed that conflict and change represent central dimensions of both <b>industrial</b> <b>relations</b> and stress theory. Furthermore, the practice of <b>industrial</b> <b>relations</b> is inherently stressful: Forming a labour-management relationship, joint decision-making, implementing <b>industrial</b> <b>relations</b> decisions and breakdowns in the labour-management relationship are all potentially stressful activities for members of management and labour alike. However, despite the strong theoretical and practical association between <b>industrial</b> <b>relations</b> and stress, no attempt has been made to conduct a comprehensive x vpirical investigation of the stress associated with the practice of <b>industrial</b> <b>relations.</b> Accordingly, in the present thesis, the stress associated {{with a wide range of}} <b>industrial</b> <b>relations</b> events was examined. Before investigating the <b>industrial</b> <b>relations</b> stress process, it was necessary to develop an appropriate instrument to measure the stress associated with <b>industrial</b> <b>relations</b> practice. Thus the initial study was aimed at developing the <b>Industrial</b> <b>Relations</b> Event Scale. This was done using the life events approach, a well-documented means of measuring stress. Within the life events paradigm, Sarason's approach has been well-received as it overcomes many of the criticisms levelled against earlier life event scales. Consequently, Sarason's format was adopted for the development of the <b>Industrial</b> <b>Relations</b> Event Scale. The 63 -item <b>Industrial</b> <b>Relations</b> Event Scale contains three subscales, the occurrence, negative and positive scales. The occurrence scale assesses retrospectively the number of <b>industrial</b> <b>relations</b> events that have occurred over a 12 -month period, As such, the occurrence score provides an index of objective stressors.

We intend to add to this literature by introducing unique explanatory and contextual variables. The study explains the impact of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) on employee attitudes through justice within the context of cooperative employee relations. We argue that the concept of justice, which is implied in both socially responsible organizational policies and cooperative employee-employer relations, may be an important addition as a mediating variable. In essence, the study explores the mediating effects of the two primary types of justice, i. e., distributive and procedural, on the relationship between perceived corporate social responsibility, and job satisfaction, and affective commitment. Additionally, we introduce ethics-based psychological foundations, i. e., heuristic and deontic fairness theories to explain the studied relationship.
