5|$|Louis Pojman has {{suggested}} four strong influences on Kant's ethics. The {{first is the}} Lutheran sect Pietism, to which Kant's parents subscribed. Pietism emphasised honesty and moral living over doctrinal belief, more concerned with feeling than rationality. Kant believed that rationality is required, but {{that it should be}} concerned with morality and good will. Second is the political philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, whose work, The Social Contract, influenced Kant's view on the fundamental worth of human beings. Pojman also cites contemporary ethical debates as influential to the development of Kant's ethics. Kant favoured rationalism over empiricism, which meant he viewed morality as a form of knowledge, rather than something based on human desire. Natural law (the belief that the moral law is determined by nature) and <b>intuitionism</b> (the belief that humans have intuitive awareness of objective moral truths) were, according to Pojman, also influential for Kant.|$|E

25|$|Brouwer's celebrity is not {{exclusively}} {{due to his}} topological work. The proofs of his great topological theorems are not constructive, and Brouwer's dissatisfaction with this is partly what led him to articulate the idea of constructivity. He became the originator and zealous defender {{of a way of}} formalising mathematics that is known as <b>intuitionism,</b> which at the time made a stand against set theory. The fixed-point theorem is, as he originally stated it, false in <b>intuitionism,</b> and Brouwer disavowed it, proposing instead alternative versions to be constructively proven.|$|E

25|$|In Chapter III A Critique of Mathematic Reasoning, §11. The paradoxes, Kleene {{discusses}} <b>Intuitionism</b> and Formalism in depth.

Extraordinary writing by an extraordinary mathematician.|$|E
25|$|Leopold Kronecker {{was skeptical}} {{of the notion of}} {{infinity}} and how his fellow mathematicians were using it in the 1870s and 1880s. This skepticism was developed in the philosophy of mathematics called finitism, an extreme form of mathematical philosophy in the general philosophical and mathematical schools of constructivism and <b>intuitionism.</b>|$|E
25|$|Kant {{believed}} that mathematical truths were forms of synthetic a priori knowledge, {{which means they}} are necessary and universal, yet known through intuition. Kant's often brief remarks about mathematics influenced the mathematical school known as <b>intuitionism,</b> a movement in philosophy of mathematics opposed to Hilbert's formalism, and the logicism of Frege and Bertrand Russell.|$|E
40|$|Cohen’s {{hostility to}} Rawls’ {{justification}} of the Difference Principle by social facts spawned Cohen’s general thesis that ultimate principles {{of justice and}} morality are fact-insensitive, but explain how any fact-sensitive principle is grounded in facts. When facts F ground principle P, reformulating this relation as conditional “If F, then P” is trivial and thus explanatorily impotent. Explanatory, hence justificatory, force derives either from subsumption under more general principles, or precisely exhibiting value in light of relevant (actual or hypothetical) facts. In examples where no subsumption occurs, actual facts trivially become hypothetical facts, an empty formalism. Indeed, Rawls’ grounding of principles of justice in “conditions of life” can easily be reformulated as a conditional principle “sensitive” only to hypothetical such conditions, and thus formally fact-insensitive, for all Cohen’s ire against Rawls’s grounding. Moreover, any plausible “ultimate fact-insensitive principle” must be intricately qualified, which tacit ceteris paribus clauses mask. Each qualification implies prioritisation of one principle over another in conceivable circumstances, and wherever the now qualified principle is given scope, that too implies prioritisation over competing principles in typical circumstances. Any principle is thus sensitive to conceivable circumstances of application, as recognised by more sophisticated <b>intuitionisms.</b> Non-trivial ultimate principles – luck egalitarianism, act utilitarianism, etc. - require defense, which inevitably involves showing how they best interpret and respond to facts about human needs, goals, and capacities in predictable circumstances. Finally, the substantive debate between Rawls and Cohen about which facts {{are relevant to the}} DP is only obscured by the doctrine of fact-insensitivity...|$|R
25|$|Like <b>intuitionism,</b> constructivism {{involves}} the regulative principle that only mathematical entities {{which can be}} explicitly constructed {{in a certain sense}} should be admitted to mathematical discourse. In this view, mathematics is an exercise of the human intuition, not a game played with meaningless symbols. Instead, it is about entities that we can create directly through mental activity. In addition, some adherents of these schools reject non-constructive proofs, such as a proof by contradiction.|$|E
25|$|A {{major force}} behind <b>intuitionism</b> was L.E.J. Brouwer, who {{rejected}} {{the usefulness of}} formalized logic of any sort for mathematics. His student Arend Heyting postulated an intuitionistic logic, different from the classical Aristotelian logic; this logic does not contain {{the law of the}} excluded middle and therefore frowns upon proofs by contradiction. The axiom of choice is also rejected in most intuitionistic set theories, though in some versions it is accepted. Important work was later done by Errett Bishop, who managed to prove versions of the most important theorems in real analysis within this framework.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, {{philosophers}} of mathematics were already beginning to divide into various schools of thought about all these questions, broadly distinguished by their pictures of mathematical epistemology and ontology. Three schools, formalism, <b>intuitionism,</b> and logicism, emerged at this time, partly in response to the increasingly widespread worry that mathematics as it stood, and analysis in particular, did not live up to the standards of certainty and rigor that had been taken for granted. Each school addressed the issues that came to the fore at that time, either attempting to resolve them or claiming that mathematics is not entitled to its status as our most trusted knowledge.|$|E
500|$|Debate among mathematicians {{grew out}} of {{opposing}} views {{in the philosophy of}} mathematics regarding the nature of actual infinity. Some held to the view that infinity was an abstraction which was not mathematically legitimate, and denied its existence. Mathematicians from three major schools of thought (constructivism and its two offshoots, <b>intuitionism</b> and finitism) opposed Cantor's theories in this matter. For constructivists such as Kronecker, this rejection of actual infinity stems from fundamental disagreement with the idea that nonconstructive proofs such as Cantor's diagonal argument are sufficient proof that something exists, holding instead that constructive proofs are required. <b>Intuitionism</b> also rejects the idea that actual infinity is an expression of any sort of reality, but arrive at the decision via a different route than constructivism. Firstly, Cantor's argument rests on logic to prove the existence of transfinite numbers as an actual mathematical entity, whereas intuitionists hold that mathematical entities cannot be reduced to logical propositions, originating instead in the intuitions of the mind. Secondly, the notion of infinity as an expression of reality is itself disallowed in <b>intuitionism,</b> since the human mind cannot intuitively construct an infinite set. Mathematicians such as Brouwer and especially Poincaré adopted an intuitionist stance against Cantor's work. Citing the paradoxes of set theory as an example of its fundamentally flawed nature, Poincaré held that [...] "most of the ideas of Cantorian set theory should be banished from mathematics once and for all." [...] Finally, Wittgenstein's attacks were finitist: he believed that Cantor's diagonal argument conflated the intension of a set of cardinal or real numbers with its extension, thus conflating the concept of rules for generating a set with an actual set.|$|E
2500|$|Intuitionist definitions, {{developing}} {{from the}} philosophy of mathematician L.E.J. Brouwer, identify mathematics with certain mental phenomena. An example of an intuitionist definition is [...] "Mathematics is the mental activity which consists in carrying out constructs one after the other." [...] A peculiarity of <b>intuitionism</b> is that it rejects some mathematical ideas considered valid according to other definitions. In particular, while other philosophies of mathematics allow objects that can be proved to exist even though they cannot be constructed, <b>intuitionism</b> allows only mathematical objects that one can actually construct.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer founded <b>intuitionism</b> as a {{philosophy}} of mathematics. This philosophy, poorly understood at first, stated {{that in order for}} a mathematical statement to be true to a mathematician, that person must be able to intuit the statement, to not only believe its truth but understand the reason for its truth. A consequence of this definition of truth was the rejection of the law of the excluded middle, for there are statements that, according to Brouwer, could not be claimed to be true while their negations also could not be claimed true. [...] Brouwer's philosophy was influential, and the cause of bitter disputes among prominent mathematicians. Later, Kleene and Kreisel would study formalized versions of intuitionistic logic (Brouwer rejected formalization, and presented his work in unformalized natural language). With the advent of the BHK interpretation and Kripke models, <b>intuitionism</b> became easier to reconcile with classical mathematics.|$|E
2500|$|The {{foundational}} {{philosophy of}} <b>intuitionism</b> or constructivism, as exemplified {{in the extreme}} by Brouwer and more coherently by Stephen Kleene, requires proofs to be [...] "constructive" [...] in nature {{the existence of an}} object must be demonstrated rather than inferred from a demonstration of the impossibility of its non-existence. For example, as a consequence of this the form of proof known as reductio ad absurdum is suspect.|$|E
2500|$|Cantor's ideas {{ultimately}} {{were largely}} accepted, strongly supported by David Hilbert, amongst others. Hilbert predicted: [...] "No one will drive {{us from the}} paradise which Cantor created for us". To which Wittgenstein replied [...] "if one person can {{see it as a}} paradise of mathematicians, why should not another see it as a joke?" [...] The rejection of Cantor's infinitary ideas influenced the development of schools of mathematics such as constructivism and <b>intuitionism.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Proponents of <b>intuitionism,</b> from Kronecker onwards, {{reject the}} claim that there are {{actually}} infinite mathematical objects or sets. [...] (Also, according to Aristotle, a completed infinity cannot exist even as an idea {{in the mind of}} a human.) Consequently, they reconstruct the foundations of mathematics {{in a way that does}} not assume the existence of actual infinities. [...] On the other hand, constructive analysis does accept the existence of the completed infinity of the integers.|$|E
2500|$|In mathematics, <b>intuitionism</b> is {{a program}} of methodological reform whose motto is that [...] "there are no non-experienced {{mathematical}} truths" [...] (L.E.J. Brouwer). From this springboard, intuitionists seek to reconstruct what {{they consider to be}} the corrigible portion of mathematics in accordance with Kantian concepts of being, becoming, intuition, and knowledge. Brouwer, the founder of the movement, held that mathematical objects arise from the a priori forms of the volitions that inform the perception of empirical objects.|$|E
2500|$|In <b>intuitionism,</b> {{the term}} [...] "explicit construction" [...] is not cleanly defined, {{and that has}} led to criticisms. Attempts have been made to use the {{concepts}} of Turing machine or computable function to fill this gap, leading to the claim that only questions regarding the behavior of finite algorithms are meaningful and should be investigated in mathematics. This has led {{to the study of the}} computable numbers, first introduced by Alan Turing. Not surprisingly, then, this approach to mathematics is sometimes associated with theoretical computer science.|$|E
2500|$|Intuitionistic logic was {{developed}} by Heyting to study Brouwer's program of <b>intuitionism,</b> in which Brouwer himself avoided formalization. Intuitionistic logic specifically {{does not include the}} law of the excluded middle, which states that each sentence is either true or its negation is true. [...] Kleene's work with the proof theory of intuitionistic logic showed that constructive information can be recovered from intuitionistic proofs. For example, any provably total function in intuitionistic arithmetic is computable; this is not true in classical theories of arithmetic such as Peano arithmetic.|$|E
2500|$|After his move, Rainer began {{expanding}} {{the scope of}} his contribution, and passed on to his students a particular view of science, decisively materialistic, rationalist, and anti-metaphysical. In particular, Rainer rejected the <b>intuitionism</b> of Henri Bergson, which had enjoyed a surge in popularity. His intellectual heroes and models of researchers included Claude Bernard, Rudolf Virchow, and especially Goethe. The physician and left-wing political figure Ion Vitner writes that Rainer's understanding of the human body, heavily influenced {{by the work of}} Wilhelm Roux, centered on [...] "life", [...] "movement", [...] "function", and ultimately [...] "ontogenesis", rather than on the [...] "static catalog" [...] of 19th-century anatomy.|$|E
2500|$|With this {{analysis}} of aesthetic principles, borrowing from Henri Bergson, Ralea toned down his own rationalism and determinism, taking in relativism and <b>intuitionism.</b> With his respect for critical intuition, {{his critique of}} determinism, and his cosmopolitanism, he came unexpectedly close to the aestheticism of his rival Lovinescu, and, though him, to the [...] "aesthetic autonomism" [...] of Titu Maiorescu. Ralea even sketched out his own relativist theory, according to which works of art could have limitless interpretations (or [...] "unforeseen significances"), thus unwittingly paralleling, or anticipating, the semiotics of Roland Barthes. With Între două lumi, he still rejected individualism and subjectivity, but also nuanced his corporatist collectivism. As he noted, militancy in favor of either philosophy had sparked the modern crisis. The solution, Ralea suggested, was for man to rediscover the simple joys of anonymity.|$|E
2500|$|In his 1963 paper Realism he popularised a {{controversial}} approach {{to understanding the}} historical dispute between realist and other non-realist schools of philosophy such as idealism, nominalism, Irrealism etc. [...] He characterized all of these latter positions as anti-realist and argued that the fundamental disagreement between realist and anti-realist was over the nature of truth. [...] For Dummett, realism is best understood as accepting the classical characterisation of truth as bivalent (every proposition is either true or false) and evidence-transcendent, while anti-realism rejects this {{in favor of a}} concept of knowable (or assertible) truth. [...] Historically, these debates had been understood as disagreements about whether a certain type of entity objectively exists or not. Thus, we may speak of (anti-)realism with respect to other minds, the past, the future, universals, mathematical entities (such as natural numbers), moral categories, the material world, or even thought. [...] The novelty of Dummett's approach consisted in seeing these disputes as, at base, analogous to the dispute between <b>intuitionism</b> and Platonism in the philosophy of mathematics.|$|E
50|$|Ethical <b>intuitionism</b> (also called moral <b>intuitionism)</b> is {{a family}} of views in moral {{epistemology}} (and, on some definitions, metaphysics). At minimum, ethical <b>intuitionism</b> is the thesis that our intuitive awareness of value, or intuitive knowledge of evaluative facts, forms the foundation of our ethical knowledge.|$|E
50|$|Constructivism {{is often}} {{identified}} with <b>intuitionism,</b> although <b>intuitionism</b> {{is only one}} constructivist program. <b>Intuitionism</b> maintains that the foundations of mathematics lie in the individual mathematician's intuition, thereby making mathematics into an intrinsically subjective activity. Other forms of constructivism are not based on this viewpoint of intuition, and are compatible with an objective viewpoint on mathematics.|$|E
50|$|Some {{recent work}} {{suggests}} the view may be enjoying {{a resurgence of}} interest in academic philosophy. Robert Audi {{is one of the}} main supporters of ethical <b>intuitionism</b> in our days. His 2005 book, The Good in the Right, claims to update and strengthen Rossian <b>intuitionism</b> and to develop the epistemology of ethics. Michael Huemer's book Ethical <b>Intuitionism</b> (2005) also provides a recent defense of the view. Furthermore, authors writing on normative ethics often accept methodological <b>intuitionism</b> as they present allegedly obvious or intuitive examples or thought experiments as support for their theories.|$|E
50|$|Sufficiently broadly defined, ethical <b>intuitionism</b> can {{be taken}} to {{encompass}} cognitivist forms of moral sense theory.
