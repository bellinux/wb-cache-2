It can be continuously operated with average core outlet temperature between 900 ?C and 950 ?C, so the core temperature {{is one of the}} key features in the design of VHTR. <b>Bypass</b> <b>flow</b> in the prismatic core of VHTR is not a designed feature but it is inevitable due to the combination of several causes and considerably affects the core temperature. Although <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> has been studied extensively, the current status of research on thermal/hydraulic core flow of VHTR is far from completion. Present study is the starting of <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> characteristic investigation using small-scale model that will fulfill understandings of <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> in the prismatic core of VHTR. <b>Bypass</b> <b>flow</b> experiments are conducted by using three small-scale models of prismatic blocks. They are stacked in a test section to form bypass gaps of single-layer blocks as exist in prismatic core of VHTR. Three bypass gap widths set in air and water flow experiments are 6. 1, 4. 4 and 2. 7 mm. Experimental data shows that <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> fraction depends on bypass gap width and downstream condition of prismatic blocks, while pressure drop of <b>flow</b> through <b>bypass</b> gaps depends on bypass gap width only. <b>Bypass</b> <b>flow</b> simulations are performed by using STAR-CCM+ software after meshing parameters were determined from simulation exercises and grid independent study.

In this study, we report our test of the hypothesis that an apoplastic pathway (the so-called <b>bypass</b> <b>flow)</b> causes a difference in salt resistance between rice genotypes {{and can be used}} in screening for salinity resistance. Fourteen-day-old seedlings of low- and high-Na+-transporting recombinant inbred lines (10 of each) of rice IR 55178 were treated with 50 mm NaCl and 0. 2 mm trisodium- 8 -hydroxy- 1, 3, 6 -pyrenetrisulphonic acid (PTS), a <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> tracer, for short (4 d) and long (90 d) periods of time. The results showed that the average shoot Na+ concentration and <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> for high-Na+-transporting lines were 1. 4 and 2. 4 times higher than those of low-Na+-transporting lines, respectively. There was a positive linear correlation between the percentage of <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> and Na+ concentrations in the shoots, suggesting that the difference in Na+ transport in rice is a consequence of different degrees of <b>bypass</b> <b>flow.</b> Moreover, a high correlation was found between <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> and seedling survival after prolonged salt stress: the lower the magnitude of <b>bypass</b> <b>flow,</b> the greater the seedling survival.

40|$|ObjectiveWe {{investigated}} {{whether the}} degree of vulnerability of different areas in the developing brain varies according to the specific mechanism of the insults caused by cardiopulmonary bypass. MethodsA meta-analysis of 2 experimental studies (n =  80) was conducted. The end points of the otherwise identical studies were tissue oxygen index in the first experiment, whereas cerebral microvessel vasoconstriction and inflammatory response of endothelial cells were directly visualized in the second study. We assigned ultra–low <b>flow</b> <b>bypass</b> at 25 °C for 60 minutes as control; circulatory arrest at 25 °C for 60 minutes as ischemic stress under circulatory arrest (ischemia–CA); and ultra–low <b>flow</b> <b>bypass</b> at 34 °C for 60 minutes as the stress under ultra–low <b>flow</b> <b>bypass</b> (ischemia–ULF). Histologic neuronal damage was the primary outcome. Secondary measures included neurologic recovery. ResultsVasoconstriction after ischemia and inflammation after bypass were independent predictors of severe histologic damage. The caudate nucleus was significantly vulnerable to ischemia–CA and was significantly influenced by vasoconstriction. In contrast, the hippocampus was significantly vulnerable to ischemia–ULF. The different forms of ischemic insults did not influence Purkinje cells, whereas Purkinje damage significantly correlated with inflammation. Tissue oxygen index {{had the ability to}} differentiate accurately regional damage. Neurologic recovery under ischemia–CA was significantly worse compared with ischemia–ULF. Neurologic recovery correlated with neuronal damage in the caudate nucleus, but it did not correlate with damage in the hippocampus. ConclusionsNeuronal vulnerability in different areas of the developing brain varies according to mechanisms of bypass-induced ischemic stress.

PNNL used fixed-location hydroacoustic sampling {{across the entire}} project, especially at the sluiceway and spillway, using multiple split-beam transducers at selected locations. At the sluiceway nearfield, we used an acoustic camera to track fish. The fish data were interpreted and integrated with hydraulic data from a CFD model and in-field ADCP measurements. Two sluiceway operations were compared: West only (SL 1) vs. West+East (SL 1 + SL 18). Based on our findings, we concluded that The Dalles Dam sluiceway {{has the potential to}} be highly efficient and effective at passing juvenile salmonids. This potential could be tapped with hydraulic and entrance enhancements to the sluiceway. We recommended the following: (1) six rather than three sluice gates should be opened to take advantage of the maximum hydraulic capacity of the sluiceway. (2) The turbine units below open sluice gates should be operated as a standard fish operations procedure. (3) In 2005, the Corps and fisheries agencies should consider operating sluice gates in one or more of the following combinations of six gates: (a) SL 1 - 1, 1 - 2, 1 - 3 and SL 18 - 1, 18 - 2, 18 - 3 (repeat 2004 operation), (b) SL 1 - 1, 1 - 2, 1 - 3 and SL 11 - 1, 11 - 2, 11 - 3, or (c) SL 1 - 1, 1 - 2, 1 - 3 and SL 2 - 1, 2 - 2, 2 - 3.

The study addressed one of the main programs dedicated to improving juvenile salmonid survival at The Dalles Dam: Surface <b>Flow</b> <b>Bypass.</b> The study objectives (see below) were met using a combination of hydroacoustic and hydraulic data. The study incorporated fixed-location hydroacoustic methods across the entire powerhouse, with especially intense sampling using multiple split-beam transducers at all sluiceway portals. We did not sample fish passage at the spillway in 2005. In the sluiceway nearfield, we used an acoustic camera to track fish movements. The fish data were interpreted with hydraulic data from a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. Fish passage data were collected in the framework of an “experiment” using a randomized block design (3 -day treatments; two treatments) to compare two sluiceway operational configurations: Sluice 2 + 5 and Sluice 2 + 19 (six gates open for each configuration). Total project outflow was 76 % of the 10 -year average for spring and 71 % of the 10 -year average for summer. Based on these findings, we make the following recommendations: 1) The sluice should be operated 24 h/d from April until November. 2) Open six rather than three sluice gates to take advantage of the maximum hydraulic capacity of the sluiceway. 3) Open the three gates above the western-most operating main turbine unit and the three gates at MU 8 where turbine passage rates are relatively high. 4) Operate the turbine units below open sluice gates as a standard fish operations procedure. 5) Develop hydraulic and entrance enhancements to the sluiceway to tap the potential of The Dalles Dam sluiceway to be highly efficient and effective at passing juvenile salmonids. 6) Consider the following elements for surface <b>flow</b> <b>bypasses</b> during design of any sluiceway enhancements at The Dalles Dam: Form an extensive surface <b>flow</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> net (surface <b>bypass</b> discharge greater than ~ 7 % of total project discharge) at both west and east ends of the dam; Create a gradual increase in water velocity approaching the surface <b>flow</b> <b>bypass</b> (ideally, acceleration 3 m/s) to entrain the subject juvenile fishes, e. g., 10, 000 cfs or so; Adapt the shape and orientation of the surface entrance(s) to fit site-specific features, i. e., test a Removable Sluiceway Weir. 7) The Dalles Dam sluiceway has potential to be highly efficient and effective at passing juvenile salmonids.

40|$|An apoplastic pathway, the {{so-called}} <b>bypass</b> <b>flow,</b> {{is important for}} Na+ uptake in rice under saline conditions. The primary aim of this thesis was to identify the point of entry for <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> into rice roots subjected to salinity. Investigations using lateral rootless mutants (lrt 1, lrt 2), a crown rootless mutant (crl 1), their wild types (Oochikara, Nipponbare and Taichung 65, respectively) and seedlings of rice cv. IR 36 showed that the entry point, quantified using trisodium- 8 -hydroxy- 1, 3, 6 -pyrenetrisulphonic acid (PTS), {{was not at the}} sites of lateral root emergence. However, PTS was identified in the vascular tissue of lateral roots using both epifluorescence microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Cryo-scanning electron microscopy and epifluorescence microscopy of sections stained with berberine-aniline blue and Fluorol Yellow 088 revealed that an exodermis was absent in the lateral roots, suggesting that the lack of the exodermis allowed PTS to pass through the cortical layers, enter the stele and be transported to the shoot via the transpiration stream. These findings suggest a role for the lateral roots of rice in <b>bypass</b> <b>flow.</b> The addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and silicon (Si) to the culture solution significantly reduced Na+ uptake to the shoot by reducing <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> through the lateral roots. PEG was found to be more effective than Si. It was also shown that changing the relative humidity in the air around the shoots had a significant effect on the magnitude of <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> and the flux of water across the roots: the greater the flux of water through the roots, the greater the Na+ uptake and <b>bypass</b> <b>flow.</b> Furthermore, results showed that recombinant inbred lines of rice with low Na+ transport possessed low magnitudes of <b>bypass</b> <b>flow,</b> whereas lines with high Na+ transport had a high degree of <b>bypass</b> <b>flow,</b> indicating that <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> {{could be used as a}} criterion for screening salt resistance in rice varieties...|$|R
40|$|Core <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> {{has been}} one of key issues in the very high {{temperature}} reactor (VHTR) design for securing core thermal margins and achieving target temperatures at the core exit. The <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> in a prismatic VHTR core occurs through the control element holes and the radial and axial gaps between the graphite blocks for manufacturing and refueling tolerances. These gaps vary with the core life cycles because of the irradiation swelling/shrinkage characteristic of the graphite blocks such as fuel and reflector blocks, which are main components of a core's structure. Thus, the core <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> occurs in a complicated multidimensional way.

40|$|An {{area that}} has been {{identified}} as significantly important {{in the development of a}} high temperature reactor (HTR) is the prediction of leakage and <b>bypass</b> <b>flows.</b> It is therefore essential to understand the influence of leakage and <b>bypass</b> <b>flows</b> on the thermal performance of an HTR. A methodology was developed to conduct an integral thermal analysis of a reactor using a CFD approach. One of the main objectives was to include leakage and <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> paths in order to provide a capability for simulating these very detailed flows. This paper investigates leakage and <b>bypass</b> <b>flows</b> through the PBMR reactor unit. It was found that, although these flows are dependent on the pressure drop through the pebble bed, a change in pebble bed pressure drop does not result in a similar change in the predicted leakages flows. It is also shown that the ability to account for leakage and <b>bypass</b> <b>flows</b> in an integral manner can help designers to focus their efforts on the specific regions that need to be targeted for the improvement of the life expectancy of the graphite blocks. Furthermore, leakage and <b>bypass</b> <b>flows</b> were found to reduce the pressure drop across the reactor unit while increasing the peak fuel temperatures. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|The {{clinical}} features of liver cirrhosis are manifestation of altered hepatic hemodynamics and of reduced hepatic cell mass, represented by portal hypertension and sometimes hepatic failure. Histological, cirrhosis {{is defined in}} general as a diffusely altered reconstruction of the lobular parenchyma with widespread connective tissue septa, which circumscribe regenerative nodules of the hepatocytes and contain anastomoses between efferent as well as afferent vascular systems linking central and portal canals. Thus, {{a large portion of}} portal blood <b>flow</b> <b>bypasses</b> the hepatocytes and reticuloendothelial cells, depleting them of their metabolic and detoxifying function...|$|R

We report a case of bilateral large aneurysms of the cavernous internal carotid artery treated by reconstruction of the bilateral ICAs with radial artery grafts and trapping of the ICAs. Bilateral radial artery grafts provide sufficient cerebral blood flow and good vascular reserve. Reconstruction of ICA with high <b>flow</b> <b>bypass</b> is effective and reliable option {{for the treatment of}} aneurysms that require parent artery occlusion, but careful perioperative management is very important to avoid ischemia of terminal branch and perforator infarction or thromboembolic stroke...|$|R

40|$|An apoplastic pathway, the {{so-called}} <b>bypass</b> <b>flow,</b> {{is important for}} Na+ uptake in rice (Oryza sativa L.) under saline conditions; however, the precise site of entry is not yet known. We report {{the results of our}} test of the hypothesis that <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> of Na+ in rice occurs at the site where lateral roots emerge from the main roots. We investigated Na+ uptake and <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> in lateral rootless mutants (lrt 1, lrt 2), a crown rootless mutant (crl 1), their wild types (Oochikara, Nipponbare and Taichung 65, respectively) and in seedlings of rice cv. IR 36. The results showed that shoot Na+ concentration in lrt 1, lrt 2 and crl 1 was lower (by 20 - 23 %) than that of their wild types. In contrast, the <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> quantified using trisodium- 8 -hydroxy- 1, 3, 6 -pyrenetrisulphonic acid (PTS) was significantly increased in the mutants, from an average of 1. 1 % in the wild types to 3. 2 % in the mutants. Similarly, <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> in shoots of IR 36 where the number of lateral and crown roots had been reduced through physical and hormonal manipulations was dramatically increased (from 5. 6 to 12. 5 %) as compared to the controls. The results suggest that the path of <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> in rice is not at the sites of lateral root emergence...|$|R

40|$|The {{relevance}} of <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> on water flow, solute or pesticide transport {{is becoming increasingly}} recognized. Recent investigations proved that soil salinization {{may be influenced by}} <b>bypass</b> <b>flow,</b> i. e. the rapid transport of water and solutes via macropores and/or shrinkage cracks to subsoil and groundwater. This paper explores the role of <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> in the process of accumulation and leaching of solutes, as well as of sodium, in a Mediterranean cracking soil irrigated with saline/sodic waters. The results of <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> experiments performed on undisturbed soil cores showed that leaching of solutes occurred in concomitance with bypass fluxes when a low salinity solution was alternated with a high salinity solution. Exchange of solutes between the incoming solution and the soil matrix occurred during the <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> events at the contact surfaces (cracks walls) between the solution and the soil matrix and where cracks terminated in the soil samples. Concomitant exchanges of sodium were indicated by measurements performed in the effluent solution during the <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> measurements. The amount of Sodium released from the soil during the <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> events, {{as well as that of}} the soluble salts leached from the soil, were found to depend on the degree of soil cracking. These results indicated that: 1 in management of irrigation in cracking soils, under the occurrence of bypass fluxes, alternating a low salinity/sodicity water with a high salinity/sodicity solution can be effective for preventing salinization and sodification: 2 greater efficiency of removal of sodium/soluble salts can be obtained if application of the leaching solution is performed when the soil is at a considerable degree of cracking...|$|R

In this described modification of sutureless technique through the lateral approach, the left atrium is marsupialized around the common pulmonary venous chamber, except on the right lateral aspect, providing a bloodless field with minimal retraction of heart facilitating the surgery at mild hypothermia. This technique can be particularly useful in small confluence obstructed TAPVC and in mixed TAPVC...|$|R
