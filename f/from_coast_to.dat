Galloway in 1927. The Guide, with a circulation of over 25,000 and an advertisers' list including business firms <b>from</b> <b>coast</b> <b>to</b> coast, was the largest African-American newspaper west of the Missouri River through the 1930s.|$|E

5|$|On December 17, Judge Sanderson finally {{ruled that}} prize {{fighting}} was illegal in San Francisco {{and the courts}} would not determine who the winner was. Sharkey retained the purse, but the decision provided no vindication for Earp. Until the fight, Earp had been a minor figure known regionally in California and Arizona. Afterward, his name was known <b>from</b> <b>coast</b> <b>to</b> coast in the worst possible way. Earp sold his interest in his horses on December 20 and left San Francisco shortly afterward. He only returned when he caught a boat to Alaska. Earp's decision left a smear on his public character that followed him until he died and afterward.|$|E
5|$|The summer {{breeding}} range stretches across North America <b>from</b> <b>coast</b> <b>to</b> coast. It is bounded {{on the north}} by Saskatchewan and stretches south across North America to North Carolina on the east coast, and northern California on the west coast. The American goldfinch is a short-distance migrant, moving south in response to colder weather and lessened food supply. The migration is completed in compact flocks, which travel in an erratic, wavelike flight pattern.|$|E
5|$|Agricola's successors {{were unable}} or unwilling to further subdue the far north. The {{fortress}} at Inchtuthil was dismantled before its completion, and the other fortifications of the Gask Ridge were abandoned within the space of a few years. By CE 87 the occupation was limited to the Southern Uplands, {{and by the end of}} the first century the northern limit of Roman expansion was a line drawn between the Tyne and Solway Firth. Elginhaugh fort, in Midlothian, dates to about this period, as may Castle Greg in West Lothian. The Romans eventually withdrew to a line in what is now northern England, building the fortification known as Hadrian's Wall <b>from</b> <b>coast</b> <b>to</b> coast.|$|E
5000|$|Cyrtophora moluccensis is a tent-web spider in the orb-weaver family. It is {{native to}} India, Japan, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Australia, Fiji, and Tonga. It is often found in {{disturbed}} or open habitats <b>from</b> <b>coasts</b> <b>to</b> forest and mountainous interiors.|$|R

5|$|The Romans began {{military}} expeditions {{into what}} is now Scotland from about 71 CE, building a series of forts, but by 87 the occupation {{was limited to the}} Southern Uplands {{and by the end of}} the first century the northern limit of Roman expansion was a line drawn between the Tyne and Solway Firth. The Romans eventually withdrew to a line in what is now northern England, building the fortification known as Hadrian's Wall <b>from</b> <b>coast</b> <b>to</b> coast. Around 141 CE they undertook a reoccupation of southern Scotland, moving up to construct a new limes between the Firth of Forth and the Firth of Clyde, where they built the fortification known as the Antonine Wall. The wall was overrun and abandoned soon after 160 and the Romans withdrew back to the line of Hadrian's Wall, until Roman authority collapsed in the early fifth century.|$|E

25|$|American author George R. R.

25|$|Canadians {{who served}} in the {{military}} during the Second World War met like-minded souls from across the country, and often visited clubs while in Europe. They were a ready pool of recruits for post-war organizers. A few years later, the wave of post-war immigration brought many Europeans with their own extensive experience, and they not only swelled the ranks of membership, but often formed their own clubs, helping to expand nudism <b>from</b> <b>coast</b> <b>to</b> coast.|$|E
25|$|In the United States in the {{aftermath}} of World War II, a troupe of former servicewomen was assembled by Hormel Foods to promote Spam <b>from</b> <b>coast</b> <b>to</b> coast. The group was known as the Hormel Girls and associated the food with being patriotic. In 1948, two years after its formation, the troupe had grown to 60 women with 16 forming an orchestra. The show {{went on to become a}} radio program where the main selling point was Spam. The Hormel Girls were disbanded in 1953.|$|E
25|$|In 1979 McCornack and his flying partner, Keith Nicely, flew two {{improved}} Fledglings {{from their}} base in Monterey, California, to Oshkosh, Wisconsin, where {{they made a}} positive impression on the large gathering of pilots at the EAA annual convention there. At the convention they were invited by Mother Earth News magazine to fly the aircraft on to the Atlantic coast on pure ethanol supplied by the magazine.

25|$|As {{members of}} Sarcophaga bullata are found <b>from</b> <b>coast</b> <b>to</b> coast in the United States and {{in parts of}} Canada, these flesh flies have {{been the focus of}} many forensically related studies. Most of these studies deal with the {{immature}} stages, as maggots are a helpful tool in the forensic world for determining post-mortem interval estimations. One such study concerning S. bullata determined that when evaluating a post-mortem interval, temperature {{plays a major role in}} maturation of the maggots and the decomposition of the surrounding tissue. This is an important consideration for forensic entomologists, as the ambient temperature at the crime scene before and during the colonization of human remains by arthropods must be accounted for to ensure that post-mortem interval estimations are accurate.|$|E
25|$|Soon after Silver Dome entered service, {{railroad}} {{managers and}} passenger train executives met {{to discuss the}} merits of the dome car design. In the United States, domes could only be readily used on railroads west of the Mississippi, due to lower clearances in tunnels in the eastern USA. (In Canada, Canadian Pacific would run its domes <b>from</b> <b>coast</b> <b>to</b> coast.) The managers also noted that the passenger carrying space was regarded as non-revenue space because the managers believed that passengers would not want to spend their entire trip in the domes. These factors and the added costs of car construction in adding stairs, two levels of car floors and air conditioning increased the costs to railroads that chose to operate dome cars.|$|E
25|$|More than 30,000 elk from 7-8 {{different}} herds {{summer in}} Yellowstone and approximately 15,000 to 22,000 {{winter in the}} park. The subspecies of elk that lives here are found from Arizona to northern Canada along the Rocky Mountain chain; other species of elk were historically distributed <b>from</b> <b>coast</b> <b>to</b> coast, but disappeared from the eastern United States in the early 19th century. Some other subspecies of elk still occupy coastal regions of California, Washington, and Oregon. Elk are the second largest member of the deer family (moose are the largest). Adult males, or bulls, range upwards of 700 pounds (~320kg) while females, or cows, average 500-525 pounds (~225–240kg). Their coats are reddish brown with heavy, darker-colored manes and a distinct yellowish rump patch. Elk usually live about 15 years in the wild.|$|E
