5|$|Harrison allowed Secretary of State-designate Daniel Webster to edit {{his inauguration}} speech, but he {{nevertheless}} spoke {{for an hour}} and 45 minutes, setting a record for verbosity that still stands. As the public was not excluded from the White House, there was no relief from the swarms of office seekers even after March 4, and relations with Clay broke down {{to such an extent that}} President Harrison banned him from the White House. Clay left town, never to see the President again. Harrison, despite the office seekers, liked to walk to the market each morning but on March 24 <b>got</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> the rain and soon fell ill. The primitive treatment he received, possibly influenced by his own medical training a half-century old, did nothing to improve his condition, and he died in the early morning hours of April 4. Vice President Tyler had returned to his home in Virginia once the Senate adjourned, and Secretary of State Webster sent his son Fletcher to inform Tyler of Harrison's death.|$|E

25|$|The 2003 Tour de France was {{the first}} for many years that Ullrich had not been {{considered}} a favorite. In the first week, Ullrich became sick and almost retired. He lost {{a minute and a}} half on Armstrong in the Alps. Ullrich fought back in the time trial. Armstrong had trouble with the heat and lost one and a half minutes to Ullrich. Ullrich was within a minute of Armstrong in the classification. The next day, he closed the gap by another 19 seconds in the first mountain stage. Two days later Ullrich rode away from Armstrong on the Tourmalet but Armstrong caught up. Half way into the next climb, Luz Ardiden, Armstrong's handlebar <b>got</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> a spectator's yellow musette waving in the air and he fell. Ullrich waited for Armstrong to recover, returning the courteous display by Armstrong 2 years previously. Armstrong then caught the group and attacked shortly afterwards.|$|E

Although no-one was hit by the car, one marshall was hit by debris and {{suffered}} a broken leg; the race was stopped. The race restarted after some time behind the Safety Car and Frentzen ran wide into the first corner, dropping down three places. Schumacher, who was just ahead on track but 6 seconds ahead on aggregate pitted early on lap 19. He took on fresh tyres and a fuel load that was insufficient to last {{to the end of the}} race. He rejoined 17 seconds behind Hill on aggregate but <b>got</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> traffic and soon the gap was up to 30 seconds before it stabilized. This meant that Hill rejoined 7 seconds ahead on lap 25 when he pitted and fueled to the end of the race, but only 3 of his tyres were changed due to a sticking wheel nut. This, coupled with Hill's heavy fuel load appeared to hinder him and Schumacher began to close in.|$|E

25|$|CMLL held a {{steel cage}} match {{involving}} 12 Mini-Estrellas, the rules dictated {{that the last}} two men in the cage would have immediately to face off in a Luchas de Apuestas ("Bet match") with the loser either having to unmask or have his hair shaved off as a result. The match took place on November 6, 2012 in Arena Coliseo in Guadalajara, Jalisco and included Aéreo, Astral, , Fantasy, Mercurio, Pequeño Black Warrior, Pequeño Halcón, Pequeño Olímpico, Pequeño Violencia, Pierrothito, Shockercito and Último Dragoncito. The wrestlers {{were not allowed to}} even attempt to leave the cage until three minutes into the ring, but once the deadline was up Pequeño Halcón was the first person out of the cage followed by Mercurio and Aéreo. Moments later, as Pequeño Olímpico was trying to climb over the top part of the wire mesh on the cage gave out and Pequeño Olímpico ended up with his arm trapped in the cage, needing help to get loose and to the floor where he was checked to see if he needed medical attention. After that Fantasy climbed over the cage the floor, escaping the match and joining Mercurio and Aéreo, who were still on the floor. Moments later Astral {{climbed to the top of}} the cage and dove off the 15-foot-high cage, landing a Moonsault on Mercurio, Aéreo and Fantasy who were still on the floor. During the move Astral <b>got</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> the cage and landed in an uncontrolled manner on the floor, hitting his head, which promoted the medical personnel to immediately rush him out of the arena. The bad fall also hurt Mercurio, who had to be removed from the ring on a stretcher. Many of the remaining contestants, including Pierrothito bled during the match, some was possibly intentional as part of the plan for the match while others were not intentionally bleeding. Demus 3:16 was the recipient of several throws and falls off the cage as he tried to escape, finally shaking off his opponents to climb out. Once Demus 3:16 was on the floor he needed help to even stand and had to be helped from the arena. The last person to escape was Pequeño Violencia, who's back was bleeding from being thrown against the cage repeatedly. With Pequeño Violencia out it left Shockercity and Pequeño Black Warrior as the last two men in the ring, with both of them risking their hair on the outcome of this part of the match. Shockercito finally managed to defeat his opponent when he applied the La Reienera submission hold on Pequeño Black Warrior, forcing him to submit. Following the loss Pequeño Black Warrior had all his hair shaved off. Following the match Shockercito stated that he hoped his victory would earn him a match against one of the Mini-Estrella champions.|$|E
