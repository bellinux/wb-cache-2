5000|$|Induction ceremonies are {{generally}} {{conducted by the}} Governor General at Rideau Hall in Ottawa or, on rare occasions, by the Queen herself; Elizabeth II performed her first Order of Canada investiture at Rideau Hall in August, 1973. The 2002 ceremony was held at Halifax's Pier 21 to mark the 50th anniversary of Canadian Governors General, but the most common reason for the insignia not being presented at Rideau Hall is the recipient's inability to travel to Ottawa. An early example of this occurred in 1980 when activist athlete Terry Fox was dying of terminal cancer. A more recent example occurred in 2003 with singer-songwriter Gordon Lightfoot: in 2002, shortly before a concert, Lightfoot suffered a serious abdominal hemorrhage that resulted in his being {{in a coma for}} a time and months in hospital recovering. On the news of his near-death condition, Lightfoot was promoted to the rank of Companion. Since his condition left him unable to travel, Adrienne Clarkson flew to Toronto and presented him with the insignia in a private ceremony performed in his hospital room. Similarly, in 2000 Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, at the age of 100, was invested as an Honorary Companion at Clarence House in London. Rather than place the insignia on the Queen Mother, who was recovering from a hip replacement, Clarkson handed Her Majesty her badge. Her Majesty made a point of wearing it around her neck at a special lunch following the private ceremony. Inductions can also be delegated to another individual, such as a Lieutenant Governor, as was the case when Mervyn Wilkinson was inducted into the order by Iona Campagnolo, the then Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia, in 2002. Investures can also be delayed, such {{as in the case of}} Wayne Gretzky, who was appointed to the grade of Officer in 1984 for his outstanding contributions to the game of hockey. However, as the ceremonies always conflicted with his <b>hockey</b> <b>schedule,</b> it was not until over 13 years, and two governors general, later that Gretzky could personally be invested into the order. [...] The longest delay between appointment and investiture was the 23-year delay of W. Bruce Hutchison. Hutchison was appointed in July 1967, but did not attend the investiture ceremony until April 1990 ...|$|E

The Braves defeated the Celtics twice {{in the final two}} weeks to even their season series at three games a piece while winning five of their last seven games. [...] The Braves were scheduled to host the New York Knicks on April 6, but when the Buffalo Sabres qualified for the 1976 Stanley Cup playoffs, the National <b>Hockey</b> League <b>scheduled</b> the Sabres to be the home team on the same date. When the Braves set a $25,000 price tag on the date, the Sabres swapped home game dates with the St. Louis Blues and lost on St. Louis in a best of three series on that date.|$|R

50|$|The {{fourth season}} of Svenska Serien, {{at the time}} Sweden's top-tier <b>hockey</b> league, was <b>scheduled</b> to be held over the winter of 1938-39, but due to a harsh winter, the series was played as a {{shortened}} single-round robin tournament {{in the autumn of}} 1939, immediately {{prior to the start of}} the 1939-40 season. For this reason, there was no promotion or relegation as a result of this tournament. Hammarby IF went undefeated, winning all seven matches, to win the league title. This was their first time Hammarby finished first-place in Svenska Serien, and the fourth time Hammarby finished first in Sweden's first-tier league (which had previously been Klass I and Elitserien).|$|R
50|$|Amid {{rumors that}} the Devils were {{interested}} {{in dealing with the}} Detroit Red Wings for hold-out center Keith Primeau, Devils center Bobby Holik didn't show up to training camp in what was described as a surprising decision on his part to not report to the team. Speculation among teammates and the media was that he wanted a trade. Neal Broten, who was considering retirement at the time, and Mike Peluso, who had been benched by Lemaire during the 1995-96 season and thought that he would be traded over the summer, did report to training camp along with 60 other players. Several regular players who were involved with the 1996 World Cup of <b>Hockey</b> tournament were <b>scheduled</b> to report to camp late.|$|R
5|$|Earlier in {{the season}} Commissioner Bud Selig {{expressed}} interest in scheduling a World Series game during daylight hours instead of the evening. The starting times were ultimately moved before 8p.m. ET {{for the first time}} in 30 years, but no day games were played. The Philadelphia Eagles and New York Giants of the National Football League (NFL) played across the street from Citizens Bank Park at Lincoln Financial Field on the day of Game4. The NFL moved that game's kickoff time to 1p.m. to avoid it ending too close to the start of Game4. Similarly, Game5 was played at Citizens Bank Park on the same day as the Philadelphia Flyers hosted the Tampa Bay Lightning of the National Hockey League (NHL) at the Wachovia Center. The opening faceoff of the <b>hockey</b> game was <b>scheduled</b> for 7p.m. but the NHL moved it to 5p.m. to avoid conflict.|$|R
50|$|Two debates {{took place}} during the 2011 election. The English-language debate was held on April 12, 2011 from 7:00 to 9:00 p.m. EDT, and was moderated by Steve Paikin. The French-language debate was held on April 13 from 8:00 to 10:00 p.m. EDT and was co-moderated by Paul Larocque and Anne-Marie Dussault. Both were held at the Government Conference Centre in Ottawa. After the {{original}} date was chosen for the French debate, a Montreal Canadiens playoff <b>hockey</b> game was <b>scheduled</b> for the same day, causing the debate to be moved one night forward. The four participants in both debates were Conservative leader and incumbent prime minister Stephen Harper, Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, NDP leader Jack Layton, and Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe. Green Party leader Elizabeth May was excluded from the debate by the media consortium, as her party did not have representation in the House of Commons.|$|R

50|$|With 18 NCAA {{championship}} game appearances between them, including a matchup in the 1978 {{championship game}}, Boston College and Boston University both field perennially competitive collegiate ice hockey teams and {{compete in the}} same league, Hockey East, having both previously been members of the ECAC. The two teams meet twice annually {{as part of their}} regular <b>Hockey</b> East season <b>schedule</b> and often also meet in the Hockey East and NCAA postseason tournaments. Additionally, each first and second Monday in February, BC and BU, along with Harvard and Northeastern, take part in the annual Beanpot Tournament held at TD Garden, where the Eagles and Terriers often square off in the championship game. In the 64 years of the tournament, the two teams have played for the Beanpot trophy 22 times, with BU winning 12 of the championship matchups and BC winning 10. Both teams have had stretches where they dominated the tournament, however, the Terriers have triumphed more often, winning the title 30 times compared to the Eagles' 20 titles (Harvard and Northeastern combined have only won 14 times). The Eagles defeated the Terriers 1-0 in overtime of the 2016 Beanpot championship.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the success}} of the {{informal}} Michigan hockey team in 1920, Michigan moved forward with the development of the hockey team. According to Wilfred Byron Shaw's four-volume history of the University of Michigan, [...] "Hockey also had its beginning in 1921, with Richard Barss as Coach (1921-26). Although officially not on the Western Conference athletic program, hockey provided a number of Big Ten teams with competition." [...] The 1921 season saw the development of intercollegiate hockey at Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota. In January 1921, Michigan and Wisconsin scheduled four games to be played on consecutive weekends from February 18 to 26, 1921. The 1921 team began the season with two games against the Michigan College of Mines at Houghton, Michigan. Michigan lost the first game 3-0 but won the second game 4-3. Russell Barkell, the first standout hockey player at Michigan, was the Michigan star in both games against the College of Mines. [...] However, the remainder of the season, including the planned four-game series with Wisconsin, was cancelled due to warm weather. The Michigan Alumnus reported in March 1921: [...] "The warmth of the present winter has made necessary the cancelling of all <b>scheduled</b> <b>hockey</b> games. The informal team had started off well, but lack of ice made the development of a really powerful team impossible." ...|$|R
