5|$|Yosemite Valley saw {{significant}} amounts of damage when the river <b>flooded</b> <b>the</b> valley in 1997.|$|E
5|$|About 75% of {{the island}} chain lost power {{for a few hours}} during the storm. Damage {{occurred}} to downed trees and wooden homes. Between 13 and 17percent of the non-native Australian pine on San Salvador Island experienced damage, primarily from snapping, though some browning from salt spray was noted. Several feet of water <b>flooded</b> <b>the</b> international airport at Freeport.|$|E
5|$|During this time, fans {{organized}} a mail campaign that <b>flooded</b> <b>the</b> White House with letters, influencing Gerald Ford to rechristen the Space Shuttle Constitution to Enterprise, and Roddenberry {{and most of}} the Star Trek cast were present for its roll-out on September 17, 1976.|$|E

5|$|In {{neighboring}} Dominican Republic, Gordon caused {{flooding and}} landslides that disrupted travel and communications {{to the interior}} portions of the country. Several slums around Santo Domingo <b>flooded.</b> <b>The</b> storm killed five people in the country.|$|E
5|$|The storm <b>flooded</b> <b>the</b> {{lower level}} of the massive law library at the University of Houston Law Center with eight feet of water. An {{estimated}} 174,000 books and the microfiche collection were destroyed. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) gave $21.4 million to rebuild the law library collection.|$|E
5|$|A rift {{opened and}} {{subsequently}} <b>flooded</b> <b>the</b> region {{as part of}} the breakup of the supercontinent Rodinia in the Neoproterozoic (by about 755million years ago) and the creation of the Pacific Ocean. A shoreline similar to the present Atlantic Ocean margin of the United States lay to the east. An algal mat-covered carbonate bank was deposited, forming the Noonday Dolomite. Subsidence of the region occurred as the continental crust thinned and the newly formed Pacific widened, forming the Ibex Formation. An angular unconformity (an uneven gap in the geologic record) followed.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>floods</b> were <b>the</b> {{worst in}} the country since 1926. As a result of <b>the</b> <b>flooding,</b> <b>the</b> Kuala Lumpur <b>Flood</b> Mitigation Programme was set up.|$|R
50|$|Of <b>the</b> many <b>floods</b> over <b>the</b> centuries, {{most devastating}} <b>flood</b> was <b>the</b> Great <b>Flood</b> of 1993. <b>The</b> {{subsequent}} <b>flood</b> destroyed <b>the</b> village, {{leaving only a}} handful of residents to return to the area following <b>the</b> <b>flood.</b>|$|R
50|$|June 2008 saw <b>the</b> worst <b>flooding</b> <b>the</b> Waterloo - Cedar Falls {{area had}} ever recorded; other major <b>floods</b> include <b>the</b> Great <b>Flood</b> of 1993. <b>The</b> <b>flood</b> control system {{constructed}} in the 1970s-90s largely functioned as designed.|$|R
5|$|Clayton used various {{tactics to}} pay for the needed {{infrastructure}} changes in the state. Most of the South was in desperate need of infrastructure and was behind {{the rest of the country}} in this respect. He raised taxes, tried to fix the state's bad credit by repaying and issuing bonds, and <b>flooded</b> <b>the</b> state with paper scrip. All of these tactics failed and drove up the state debt.|$|E
5|$|Haiti and the Dominican Republic, {{which share}} {{the island of}} Hispaniola, were spared much of the hurricane's force, as it passed 170mi (270km) to their south. However, 15people were killed among the island's two nations. Heavy rain <b>flooded</b> <b>the</b> streets of Santo Domingo and rough surf pounded the coast. Rain also caused {{landslides}} in Haiti, destroying several hundred homes and forcing 5,154people into temporary shelters, and compromising the temperamental water system {{in the town of}} Bainet.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 it {{was unclear}} if Beth Israel, which had already been in {{difficult}} financial shape, would be allowed, or have the means, to re-build its synagogue. The building suffered further flood damage in July 2007 when thieves stole the copper tubing for the main air-conditioning system. They broke the water main, and water from the second floor <b>flooded</b> <b>the</b> building for three days, {{to a depth of}} three to four feet, before it was discovered. The property was put up for sale.|$|E
50|$|The British {{were worried}} that the Ottoman {{government}} might try to <b>flood</b> <b>the</b> Tigris plain. As it happened, this fear was unfounded. The Ottoman troops never attempted to <b>flood</b> <b>the</b> area.|$|R
5000|$|Litavka {{also caused}} {{problems}} {{to the stadium}} several times by <b>flooding,</b> <b>the</b> stadium was under water for example during <b>the</b> 2002 European <b>floods.</b> <b>The</b> game with Slavia Prague had to be postponed.|$|R
30|$|The NMR {{experiments}} were conducted at three stages: after saturating the sample with KCl solution; after <b>flooding</b> <b>the</b> sample with damaging fluid (fresh water or HCl); and after <b>flooding</b> <b>the</b> sample with KCl solution {{at the final}} stage. NMR results show the pore distribution of different core samples before and after flooding with damaging fluids. T 2 signal distribution response showed that for all cores, the macropores represent the major contribution to the total porosity before <b>flooding</b> <b>the</b> damaging fluid. However, after <b>flooding</b> <b>the</b> damaging fluid, T 2 signal distribution response was different for different cores and for different damaging fluid.|$|R
5|$|In Puerto Vallarta, about 100mi (164km) {{southeast}} of the landfall location, the storm surge resulted in an estimated damage total of US$5million, primarily to hotels. The surge <b>flooded</b> <b>the</b> hotels and other waterfront areas, and extended up to 330feet (100m) inland. Waist-deep floodwaters swept away vans and cars, ruining several vehicles. The passage of the hurricane destroyed 150stores near the ocean and extensively damaged three hotels. Damage to the city's port was minor.|$|E
5|$|On July 31, the Tanana River {{began to}} {{overflow}} its banks in Nenana. Water <b>flooded</b> <b>the</b> rails of the Alaska Railroad in town, caused an evacuation of the town's clinic, and flooded low-lying areas throughout the town. By August 1, {{the entire town}} was at least partially flooded, with most basements and other low-lying areas being completely filled by floodwater. The flooding of the Alaska Railroad track in town forced a halt to all passenger and freight operations between Anchorage and Fairbanks, effectively cutting off Fairbanks from rail traffic.|$|E
5|$|Previous {{practices}} had required {{ships to}} withstand the flooding of a single forward hold, but did not guard against situations where two holds would flood. The case where two after (rear) holds are flooded is no better, because the engine room is quickly flooded, leaving the ship without propulsion. If two holds {{in the middle of}} the ship are <b>flooded,</b> <b>the</b> stress on the hull can become so great that the ship snaps in two.|$|E
50|$|The posts on {{the canopy}} between the Forks Market and Johnston Terminal have bands {{on them to}} commemorate the peak water levels of major <b>floods.</b> Starting from <b>the</b> bottom of the posts, the bottom marker {{represents}} <b>the</b> 1950 <b>flood,</b> <b>the</b> middle marker represents both the 1852 and 1997 <b>floods,</b> and <b>the</b> top <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> of 1826. <b>The</b> <b>flood</b> line markers {{on one of the}} posts have historic plaques with information on <b>the</b> <b>floods</b> they represent.|$|R
50|$|On September 17, 1936, {{a devastating}} <b>flood</b> hit <b>the</b> South Concho River. <b>The</b> <b>flood</b> {{destroyed}} <b>the</b> Baptist encampment facility, {{and parts of}} Christoval. Several {{people were killed in}} <b>the</b> <b>flood,</b> as they were swept away by the rapidly rising water. Following <b>the</b> <b>flood,</b> <b>the</b> encampment facilities were never rebuilt, and the property eventually became a public park.|$|R
30|$|Perfection of well {{pattern is}} {{quantified}} by the reserves’ controlled degree of water <b>flooding,</b> <b>the</b> reserves producing degree of water <b>flooding,</b> <b>the</b> single-well-controlled geological reserves, the well pattern density, injector–producer ratio, injector–producer connection factor, etc.|$|R
5|$|The Beaver Mill Lumber Company {{became one}} of the largest single lumber {{operations}} in all of Pennsylvania, and four lumber boomtowns, Beaver Mills, Star Mill, Underwood Mills, and Antes, altered the landscape in the Black Moshannon area. A dam was built at the site of an old beaver dam, and the mill ponds for the lumber mills <b>flooded</b> <b>the</b> old beaver ponds. The communities featured general stores, blacksmith shops, liveries, taverns, schools, and even a ten-pin bowling alley. The area helped to meet the nation's need for timber in mining operations, construction, and railroads.|$|E
5|$|The first {{community}} to lose power was in Maisí located within Guantánamo Province. Heavy rains {{from the outer}} bands of Hurricane Georges triggered flooding {{in the region as}} more than 10in (254mm) of rain fell by September24. Sustained winds in the hurricane reached 75mph (120km/h) with higher gusts as the storm tracked over eastern Cuba. By 9pm on September24, the eye of Georges passed over Baracoa. In Guantánamo, four rivers overflowed their banks and <b>flooded</b> <b>the</b> provincial capital; however, power lines were downed throughout the region and contact to officials in the area was impossible.|$|E
5|$|The geology of Wales {{is complex}} and varied. The {{earliest}} outcropping rocks are from the Precambrian era, some 700 Mya, and are found in Anglesey, the Llŷn peninsula, southwestern Pembrokeshire and in places near the English border. During the Lower Palaeozoic, as seas periodically <b>flooded</b> <b>the</b> land and retreated again, thousands of metres of sedimentary and volcanic rocks accumulated in a marine basin known as the Welsh Basin.|$|E
50|$|Mulberry Street in Danville can be {{affected}} by Sechler Run when it <b>floods.</b> <b>The</b> speed of the floodwaters can {{be as high as}} 6 ft to 7 ft per second. Backwater from the Susquehanna River can also <b>flood</b> <b>the</b> stream.|$|R
50|$|Heavy rains <b>flood</b> <b>the</b> river {{which in}} turn <b>floods</b> <b>the</b> Abbey, {{threatening}} the precious reliquary of Saint Winifred. When the waters recede, the saint is gone, beginning a long search with tangled motives, including a murder that challenges the monks.|$|R
50|$|Greek mythology {{describes}} three <b>floods,</b> <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> of Ogyges, <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> of Deucalion, and <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> of Dardanus. Two of the Greek Ages of Man {{concluded with}} a flood: The Ogygian Deluge ended the Silver Age, and <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> of Deucalion ended the First Bronze Age. In addition to these floods, Greek mythology says the world was also periodically destroyed by fire. See Phaëton.|$|R
5|$|The third highest-grossing film of its decade, Mom and Dad was {{claimed by}} Babb {{to have made}} $63,000 for every $1,000 the {{original}} investors contributed, and the Los Angeles Times estimated that it grossed anywhere from $40 million to $100 million. Its success spawned a number of imitations, such as Street Corner and The Story of Bob and Sally, that eventually <b>flooded</b> <b>the</b> market, {{but it was still}} being shown around the world decades later and ultimately was added to the National Film Registry in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the Welsh Highland Railway, {{the track}} bed was sold off {{piecemeal}} - often reverting {{to the original}} owners, paying much less than they had sold it for originally. Although there has been minor development on parts of the route, and Wistlandpound Reservoir has <b>flooded</b> <b>the</b> track bed close to its mid-point, much is still in open countryside, with many sections identifiable.|$|E
5|$|After a {{bill that}} would have {{provided}} funds to protect the site failed, then-President Lyndon B. Johnson signed an Executive Order that authorized funding for the Army Corps of Engineers to build a levee around the site to protect it from the imminent flooding caused by construction of the Lower Monumental Dam. Late that year, Daugherty left the dig, leaving Fryxell to lead the project. Once the Lower Monumental Dam was closed in February 1969, within three days, the site was completely underwater, due to the seepage of thick layers of gravel that had not been accounted for. However, as the site was being <b>flooded,</b> <b>the</b> excavation team laid down plastic sheeting topped with gravel in the hopes of being able to return to the dig in the future.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flooding</b> also {{affected}} <b>the</b> communities on the Baraboo River. The town of North Freedom {{had all but}} one road into town closed because of <b>flooding.</b> <b>The</b> <b>flooding</b> forced <b>the</b> closure of the Mid-Continent Railway Museum.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>flooding</b> was <b>the</b> {{result of}} works by the local council, which {{resulted}} in the culverts not being able to handle the water, causing <b>the</b> <b>flooding</b> at <b>the</b> motel.|$|R
40|$|AbstractLlanos de Moxos are vast plains in the Bolivian Amazonia {{that are}} {{continually}} <b>flooded</b> by <b>the</b> Mamore river. <b>The</b> <b>flood</b> lasts {{for several days}} affecting important cities like Trinidad, drowning people, drowning cattle and swamping arable land. Because of the cloudy skies, remote sensing observations are limited to some areas and few days. Thus, there is huge uncertainty about characteristics of flood events and possible consequences. Two-dimensional (2 D) numerical simulation {{proved to be an}} important tool for understanding <b>flood</b> events. <b>The</b> HEC-RAS model {{is one of the most}} popular hydraulic models. In 2014 a new version of HEC-RAS (HEC-RAS-v 5) was released including 2 D capabilities. The present study applied the new HEC-RAS-v 5 to simulate <b>the</b> February 2014 <b>flood</b> event in <b>the</b> Bolivian Amazonia. <b>The</b> <b>flood</b> simulated shows good performance when compared with satellite image of <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> event. In addition, the simulation provides information like water depth, flow velocity and a temporal variation of <b>the</b> <b>flood.</b> Specific locations where water begins to overflow were identified. Over most of <b>the</b> <b>flooded</b> area <b>the</b> water velocity is lower than 0. 25 ms− 1. During first ten days of <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> extent increases rapidly. <b>The</b> <b>flood</b> depth allows identifying areas exposed to different hazard levels. The west plain of the Mamore river is the most exposed to the flood; it shows bigger flood extent, longer flood duration and deeper water depth. <b>The</b> <b>flood</b> that threatens <b>the</b> city of Trinidad originates in two locations; one located 32 km at the north and other located 10 km at the south west. <b>The</b> <b>flood</b> from <b>the</b> north gets close to Trinidad twelve days after it begins to overflow, while <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> from <b>the</b> south gets close to Trinidad seven days after it begins to overflow. Although <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> from <b>the</b> north is deeper than <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> from <b>the</b> south, <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> from <b>the</b> south begins <b>flooded</b> before <b>the</b> north. Thus, water borne and vector borne diseases may originate at the south earlier than the north. The city of San Javier gets covered by flood five days after the water begins to overflow. The study shows the applicability and the value of the 2 D capabilities of the new HEC-RAS for flood studies...|$|R
