Heading north, he spent a night in an air-raid shelter in Bologna, then took a train to Verona and walked {{the rest of the}} way; he apparently traveled over 450 miles in all. Mary almost failed to recognize him when he arrived, he was so <b>dirty</b> <b>and</b> tired. He told her everything about his other family; she later admitted she felt more pity than anger.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} health care is {{generally}} low. In Cameroon, {{there is only one}} doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization. Due to financial cuts in the health care system, there are few professionals. Doctors and nurses who were trained in Cameroon, emigrate because in Cameroon the payment is poor while the workload is high. Nurses are unemployed even though their help is needed. Some of them help out voluntarily so they will not lose their skills. Outside the major cities, facilities are often <b>dirty</b> <b>and</b> poorly equipped.|$|E
5|$|When built, the {{surrounding}} area was composed of dirt roads and private residences. The Southern Pacific Railroad's 1868 west side rail line ran down Fourth Avenue past City Hall and the county courthouse. The city and county governments fought the railroad to remove the <b>dirty</b> <b>and</b> noisy steam locomotives from this route, succeeding in 1912. Southern Pacific's electric interurban line continued on the tracks until the 1930s. In 2007, work began on adding light rail tracks on Fifth Avenue for the planned MAX Green Line, and trains once again ran past City Hall starting in 2009.|$|E

5|$|October 9, 1944, {{was another}} {{in a string of}} days {{consisting}} of accused men testifying on the witness stand. This day, however, Thurgood Marshall, chief counsel for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), sat in on the proceedings. Marshall had flown to the Bay Area on a special wartime travel priority arranged by Navy Secretary Forrestal. The NAACP had given the mutiny trial top importance due to the U.S. Navy's policy of putting Negroes into <b>dirty</b> <b>and</b> dangerous jobs with no hope of advancement. Although Marshall was allowed to observe the trial, as a civilian he was ineligible to take an official role in the men's defense. After hearing five of the men defend themselves, Marshall spoke to the 50 men and then conferred with Veltmann's defense team. The next day, Marshall held a press conference, charging that Judge Advocate Coakley was handling the case in a prejudicial manner. Marshall said that, from a review of the proceedings and his conversations with the accused, he could only see these men being tried for lesser charges of individual insubordination, not mass mutiny.|$|E

25|$|The park's {{condition}} {{started to}} {{decline in the}} 1920s as the surrounding areas were developed.

25|$|In {{contrast}} to the luxurious lifestyle of the elite classes, the common people generally lived under wretched conditions, even though demand for manual labour to construct new buildings increased as the population grew.

25|$|The British Army in the 18th {{century was}} {{commonly}} seen as disciplined, regimented and harsh.

Yet, many men volunteered to join the army, to escape the bleak conditions of life in the cities, for a chance to travel the world and earn a regular wage.|$|E
25|$|While Burger {{generally}} received positive {{reviews for}} his hosting, {{the series was}} mostly panned. Its humor was seen to have crossed the line from risqué into the out-and-out <b>dirty</b> <b>and</b> many stations pushed it into late-night slots. Its low budget and lack of returning champions (staples of several modern game shows) were also focal points for criticism. This was especially since two of the previous three versions to air all featured returning champions and offered cash prizes well in excess of $10,000 {{in an era when}} purchasing power was roughly twice that of 1998.|$|E

25|$|They were heated {{by burning}} coal, 6,611 tons {{of which could}} be carried in Titanics bunkers, with a further 1,092 tons in Hold 3. The {{furnaces}} required over 600 tons of coal a day to be shovelled into them by hand, requiring the services of 176 firemen working around the clock. 100 tons of ash a day had to be disposed of by ejecting it into the sea. The work was relentless, <b>dirty</b> <b>and</b> dangerous, and although firemen were paid relatively generously there was a high suicide rate among those who worked in that capacity.|$|E
25|$|In {{the scene}} where the knights were combatting the Rabbit of Caerbannog, a real white rabbit was used, {{switched}} with puppets for its killings.

He also stated that he thought that, had they been more experienced in filmmaking, the crew would have just purchased a rabbit instead. Otherwise, the rabbit himself was unharmed. Also, the rabbit-bite effects were done by special puppetry by both Gilliam and SFX technician John Horton.|$|E
