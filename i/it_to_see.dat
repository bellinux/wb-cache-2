5|$|Caltech {{is home to}} the 1.7-ton, 130-year-old Fleming Cannon. The {{origins and}} exact age of the Fleming Cannon are not known with certainty. It is {{believed}} to have been cast during the Franco-Prussian War era, but completed in 1878 after the war was over. It was then given by the French to the United States where it was re-bored to fit American shells and the carriage constructed, but this work was completed too late for <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> use in the Spanish–American War. The cannon soon became obsolete and was donated to Southwestern Academy in San Marino, California, where it was displayed on the front lawn starting in 1925. By 1972, the school was seeking to discard the cannon, and a group of Caltech students from Fleming House took possession of the cannon and laboriously restored it to working condition. The cannon was returned to Southwestern in 1975 at the insistence of the Caltech administration, but it was permanently restored to Caltech in 1981. The cannon is one of the few objects at Caltech which is designated as unprankable given its age, fragility, and irreplaceable nature.|$|E
5|$|The game's use of The Simpsons-style humor {{received}} a mixed reception. Both GameSpot and GameTrailers {{said that the}} game delivered more than enough laughs to make it worth playing through at least once. It was considered enjoyable for both hardcore and casual The Simpsons fans by IGN and GameDaily, who also called it a particularly appealing game for diehard fans. Despite the few problems that the game had, GameSpy {{said that it was}} worth <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the humorous parodies. Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell, however, believed that the game's humor could only carry it so far, and suggested that those interested in The Simpsons humor should purchase a box set of one of the television series' seasons instead. Joe Juba of Game Informer called the game an average experience. He elaborated that the game would appeal primarily to fans of the television series, but would not be worth playing for people unfamiliar with it.|$|E

Collins was also unhappy that the website was not capable of warning him when he had two events scheduled at the same time. In a list of the best web-based calendar software for small businesses, Forbes ranked 30 Boxes second, after Google Calendar.

Newton claims that the joke was worth <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Lane's reaction but that Lane repaid him for the practical joke. The program on 3UZ had many guests who had also appeared on the television show the night before. When moving to Sydney in 1987, Lane hosted a morning show on 2UE for two years. After ending his affiliation with 2UE, he moved to 2KY and hosted a competing breakfast program in 1989. His radio programs usually involved music and interviews with visiting entertainers.|$|E
25|$|Tianeptine {{has been}} {{reported}} to be very effective for asthma. In August 1998, Dr. Fuad Lechin and colleagues at the Central University of Venezuela Institute of Experimental Medicine in Caracas published the results of a 52-week randomized controlled trial of asthmatic children; the children in the groups that received tianeptine had a sharp decrease in clinical rating and increased lung function. Two years earlier, they had found a close, positive association between free serotonin in plasma and severity of asthma in symptomatic persons. As tianeptine was the only agent known to both reduce free serotonin in plasma and enhance uptake in platelets, they decided to use <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if reducing free serotonin levels in plasma would help. By November 2004, there had been two double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trials and a >25,000 person open-label study lasting over seven years, all showing effectiveness. A 2005 study in Egypt demonstrated tianeptine to be effective in men with depression and erectile dysfunction. Tianeptine also has anticonvulsant and analgesic effects, and a clinical trial in Spain that ended in January 2007 has shown that tianeptine is effective in treating pain due to fibromyalgia. Tianeptine has been shown to have efficacy with minimal side effects in the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.|$|E

Carabott felt that the scene between Lex and Clark was [...] "worth the wait". Dyess-Nugent praised Rosenbaum's acting, arguing that it shook [...] "the show awake, sending the needle hurtling rudely into the red zone".

Lisa realizes the whole saga was a publicity stunt for the mall and criticizes management. The bargain-loving public goes shopping and Dr. Gould confesses that he actually never tested Lisa's sample. Marge says that while it was rising, Lisa believed the angel was real. Lisa denies this, but admits she was frightened and thanks her mother for her support.|$|E

[...] An extended, 127-minute version of Death Proof was screened in competition for the Palme d'Or at the 60th Cannes Film Festival.

Mal's telephone engineering experience was valuable in setting up and maintaining the electrical equipment. The Beatles were being driven back to Liverpool from London by Evans through heavy fog on 21 January 1963, when the windscreen was hit by a pebble and crazed over, so Evans had to break a large hole in <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the road ahead.

500|$|The album's lead single, [...] "If It Makes You Happy", {{underwent}} {{several different}} arrangements before {{being turned into}} a rock song. According to musician Jeff Trott, who co-wrote the song along with Crow, [...] "It started off as a twangy, David Lynch-esque sort of thing. Then [...] we played it like punk rock, really fast, as well as country and funky. You know, you get a song and put clothes on <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what looks good and what doesn't, and usually when you find the right one it's pretty obvious. With that song it was real obvious!" [...] Trott initially wrote the song {{when he was a}} member of Pete Droge's backing band, but Crow added a second verse and strengthened the melody. Sheryl Crow also has contributions by notable musicians. For example, [...] "Sweet Rosalyn" [...] features saxophone by Steve Berlin of Los Lobos, while [...] "Everyday Is a Winding Road" [...] features harmony vocals by Neil Finn of Crowded House.|$|E
500|$|Group members {{expressed}} {{just how}} demanding {{their role in}} the group had been, describing the job as [...] "hard work" [...] and [...] "a tough gig", with touring for nine months of every year and filming the television series for most of the remainder, creating little time in their lives for anything else. Members also saw importance of being [...] "career driven" [...] and in portraying a positive image of themselves to the public in their personal lives, being [...] "always on". However, the cast insisted that the stressful work was well worth <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a smile on a child's face, and described the bond between the members as [...] "like family". In 2005 Harding stated the lifestyle was [...] "quite hard in the beginning." [...] In October 2015 Robinson stated she had tried to leave the group [...] "after eight years" [...] but was convinced by producers to stay.

500|$|The tammar has 324° {{peripheral}} vision and 50° binocular vision. It can distinguish black/white gratings of different widths {{and in different}} light conditions better than most other small mammals, such as rabbits. It is nevertheless {{not as good as}} a cat or a human. Tammars appear to have some colour vision: [...] its eyes have only blue sensitive and green sensitive photoreceptor cones, allowing <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> colour in the blue-green band of the colour spectrum, but not the longer wavelengths of the red-yellow band. Nevertheless, in the band where it can see colour, it can differentiate between two monochromatic colours with wavelengths as close as [...] apart. The pinna (ear) of the tammar is mobile, allowing it to track sounds from different parts of its surroundings without moving its head. A tammar can point its pinna at a sound source and increase its eardrum's sound pressure by 25–30 dB at 5kHz. When the pinna moves away from the sound source, the animal's hearing level quickly drops. When born, a tammar's sense of smell is already developed; this allows the newborn to find its mother's pouch by the scent.|$|E
500|$|Wipeout Pulse was {{developed}} by Sony Studio Liverpool (formerly known as Psygnosis). Colin Berry, the lead designer of the game, stated {{in an interview that}} the team had received a lot of positive feedback from Wipeout Pure, and was willing to use parts of the feedback to [...] "help shape some elements of Pulse". According to Berry, some people had felt that the previous game was too difficult; the ships were considered too fast and the artificial intelligence (AI) too advanced, whereas others thought that the game was too easy and they wanted [...] "something more challenging to keep them coming back". The development team also took steps to decrease the feeling of repetition, which was often cited as one of the main complaints of Wipeout Pure. In addition, the team altered the game's difficulty settings so that players were given the choice to change the speed of the game at any time, in the event that they [...] "got stuck". Reflecting on this, Berry said: [...] "We want the people who buy <b>it,</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> all the game, {{we do not want to}} lock them out".|$|E
