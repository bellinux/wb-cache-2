25|$|When {{war broke}} out in 1914, his first idea was to join the Royal Navy, but did not <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>them</b> for some time. Toward the end of 1915, Collishaw heard that the Royal Naval Air Service was hiring, and so he applied to them instead, and {{attended}} flight training in Toronto (at his own expense) and then in England. He qualified as a pilot in January 1916. He spent seven months patrolling the British coast. Then, on 2 August 1916, he joined the RNAS's 3rd Wing which was operating at Ochey, France, flying the British Sopwith 1½ Strutters. Some of the Sopwiths were equipped as bombers, while others were configured as two-seat fighters.|$|E
500|$|Prior to broadcast, Colfer {{anticipated}} that the episode's sexual themes and content would prove controversial among television watchdog groups. He said, [...] "I absolutely expect to <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>them,</b> but I think it's handled very sweetly and very emotionally. They're expecting this big, raunchy, suggestive, brainwashing storyline when, really, it's very sweet." [...] Before the episode aired, the conservative Parents Television Council called the show [...] "reprehensible" [...] and the Fox network reckless for [...] "celebrating teen sex".|$|E
500|$|O'Mahoney and Winter {{began working}} on the film in 2006. Winter had watched a film called The Women's Story, about two Iraqi women who had journeyed {{around the country and}} filmed what they saw. They wanted to make a {{documentary}} about [...] "the people never seen on the evening news, [...] presidents, prime ministers, generals and militants ... claiming to know something of Iraq's future". Winter explained that [...] "all these documentaries coming out of Iraq were done for or by adults. Iraqi children had not been more than a UN statistic about the dead, kidnapped or injured", so they decided to concentrate on what they viewed as the [...] "real source of Iraq's future" [...] – teenagers. [...] "I wanted {{to tell the story of}} Iraq in a different way. As journalists, we do stories about kids and teenagers, but we don't <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>them.</b> If you go to the UN reports, they are just a number and that's it." [...] O'Mahoney was a little more reticent; he had recently worked in Iraq but did not wish to return due to the civil war and the deteriorating condition of the country. When it was decided to use a school as a backdrop to the story, which could also be used to provide a chronological narrative, O'Mahoney and Winter realised it would be too dangerous for the students to be seen with either a Western or Iraqi camera crew because it would draw too much attention to them, and so they decided that the students would film the documentary themselves.|$|E
60|$|Time now flew more lightly. They {{were both}} easy in their minds. The {{messenger}} was despatched to Lerici; but even Lerici was a considerable distance, and hours must elapse before his return. Still {{there was the}} hope of seeing <b>them,</b> or <b>hearing</b> <b>from</b> <b>them</b> in the interval.|$|R
50|$|Crosbie {{escaped the}} murder scene in a taxi, {{travelling}} to Morwell railway station and purchasing a ticket to Wangaratta. A male relative later found {{the bodies of the}} two women when he visited their home after not <b>hearing</b> <b>from</b> <b>them</b> for two days. Crosbie disposed of the murder weapon in a creek in Wangaratta.|$|R
60|$|I {{forgot to}} say that Rectus and I had telegraphed home to our parents {{as soon as we}} reached Savannah, and had answers back, which were very long ones for telegrams. We had also written home. But we did not say {{anything}} to Corny about all this. It would have broken her heart if she had thought about any one writing to his father and mother, and <b>hearing</b> <b>from</b> <b>them.</b>|$|R
6000|$|And {{they were}} hungry men--they were starving! Those who see their kindred and friends daily, or <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>them</b> weekly, cannot {{understand}} {{the feelings of}} men who <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>them</b> only twice in the year. Great improvements {{have taken place in}} this matter of late years; still, many of the Hudson Bay Company's outposts are so distant from the civilised world, that they cannot get news from [...] "home" [...] oftener than twice a year.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{must have}} gone around by Tilton," [...] said Tom Dillon. [...] "That's just as good a trail and about as short. We'll <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>them</b> at Black Cat Camp." ...|$|E
60|$|If Kate has not {{mentioned}} it, get Katey and Mamey {{to write and}} {{send a letter to}} Charley; of course not hinting at our being here. He wants to <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
60|$|The troopers {{turned their}} horses and trotted slowly back to Taunton, while I rode behind them between my two {{faithful}} friends, <b>hearing</b> <b>from</b> <b>them</b> {{all that had}} occurred in my absence, and telling my own adventures in return. The night had fallen ere we rode through the gates, where I handed Covenant over to the Mayor's groom, and went direct to the castle to deliver an account of my mission.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{plain to}} see that the men are sulky," [...] said Tom Grandon, towards evening. [...] "We are certain to <b>hear</b> {{something}} <b>from</b> <b>them</b> shortly." ...|$|R
6000|$|So, {{with this}} saying, [...] "Good-bye, good-bye," [...] We speed their waying Without betraying [...] Our grief, our fear [...] No more to <b>hear</b> [...] <b>From</b> <b>them,</b> close, clear, [...] Again: [...] "Good-bye, [...] Good-bye!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{seems like}} a death," [...] she said. [...] "Don't you think the ocean is like death--wide, dark, stormy, unknown? We cannot speak to or <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>them</b> that are on it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That, Prince, is {{probably}} {{where you are}} misinformed," [...] the Baron replied. [...] "You are just now in disgrace with your family, and you <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>them</b> only what the newspapers choose to tell." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course. We'd better {{write to}} the Hopetown {{authorities}} at once. Meanwhile, I suppose {{she might as well}} stay here for a few more days till we <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>them.</b> But keep your eyes and ears open, Mr. Meredith." ...|$|E

60|$|So, when I {{departed}} <b>from</b> <b>them,</b> the Book of Statute was brought, {{but what}} they said of it I know nothing at all, neither did I <b>hear</b> any more <b>from</b> <b>them.</b>|$|R
50|$|On October 31, 1896, he held {{a meeting}} {{with members of the}} Benin Rivers trading {{companies}} to introduce himself to the traders. This included European Traders of the Royal Niger Company, Itsekiri Chiefs and native traders. Additionally, he wanted to <b>hear</b> directly <b>from</b> <b>them</b> about trading issues they were having.|$|R
6000|$|... "And, Etooelle, I do not. It is {{bad enough}} as it is, entre nous; and Nelson is very welcome to stay on board his Foudroyant; voilà!--The enemy is in council; we shall soon <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>them.</b> Adieu, mon ami; {{remember}} our two Républiques!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Safely off," [...] {{reported}} Mr. Plum, when he {{came into}} tea, [...] "and we may expect to <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>them</b> in a week or two. Parcels go more slowly than letters, and this is Aunty's busy season, so wait patiently and see what will happen." ...|$|E
60|$|During {{these days}} the boys {{did not see the}} girls, nor did they <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>them.</b> Thanksgiving was passed at Brill, {{only a few of the}} {{students}} going home. Among the number to leave were Dudd Flockley and Jerry Koswell, and they did not return until a week later.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, Señor, I would <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> thine own lips. I am already {{possessed of}} the {{substance}} of the Conde de Llera's story." ...|$|R
50|$|Alter the Press wrote Long Island, New York trio The Narrative {{have been}} making subtle waves on several {{websites}} {{for the past few}} months and with their self-titled full-length, it's likely you could <b>hear</b> more <b>from</b> <b>them,</b> as it's a record that is filled with depth, variation and there are moments where the band sound extraordinary good.|$|R
50|$|To {{earn the}} money, Gortokai takes {{a job at}} a rubber farm far away in Suehn. He sends the girls {{presents}} but <b>hears</b> nothing <b>from</b> <b>them.</b> He deliberately injures his foot and uses his convalescence to invite Tene to visit him. Tene and her sister arrive in Suehn, bringing Gortokai gifts of country bread and fried chicken.|$|R
6000|$|He {{had taken}} to {{stroking}} {{with his right hand}} the hand of Imogene which he held in his left, and now he looked round at her with a glance which it was a relief not to have her meet. [...] "And till we can <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>them,</b> I suppose you will let me come to see her?" ...|$|E
60|$|Carter, the umpire, {{called out}} the batteries, and I sent my team into the field. When that long, lanky, awkward rustic {{started for the}} pitcher's box, I thought the bleachers would make him drop in his tracks. The fans were sore on any one those days, and a new pitcher was bound to <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "She won't believe me," [...] said Jeff, with a laugh. [...] "She thinks I don't know my mind. And I don't {{like the}} way we differ when we differ. We differ more than we mean to. I don't pretend to say I'm always right. She was right about that other picnic--the one I wanted to make for Mrs. Vostrand. I suppose," [...] he ended, unexpectedly, [...] "that you <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>them,</b> now and then?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{you ought}} to be," [...] he declared. [...] "Nothing but the lonely life you have been living has kept you <b>from</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>them</b> continually." ...|$|R
50|$|Indeed, {{within the}} story itself, the war correspondent, upon his {{first sight of}} the machine's pedrails, recalls <b>hearing</b> about <b>them</b> <b>from</b> Diplock in person.|$|R
30|$|Another video {{project was}} to record the views of young people {{at one of the}} {{conferences}} arranged by the Children’s Issues Centre so that the messages being created could go beyond those who were able to attend the event (Children’s Issues Centre, 2003). This approach of using children’s voices to provide advocacy was one of the key themes from the Sociology of Childhood (Smith et al., 2000) to engage both children and adults. Video was ideal for communicating with children and <b>hearing</b> <b>from</b> <b>them</b> in a way that academic writing found difficult to do. The conferences were a key opportunity to bring international visitors to Dunedin and Judith Duncan, another team member of the centre, took up Anne's idea of interviewing the early childhood visitors on film and then using these as resources when teaching students in the Postgraduate Diploma in Child Advocacy.|$|R
60|$|May 20.--To-night, I trust, {{will bring}} Charles or Lockhart, or both; at least I must <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>them.</b> A letter from Violet [Lockhart] {{gave us the}} painful {{intelligence}} {{that she had not}} mentioned to Sophia the dangerous state in which her mother was. Most kindly meant, but certainly not so well judged. I have always thought that truth, even when painful, is a great duty on such occasions, and it is seldom that concealment is justifiable.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, but not {{so heavily}} as {{ourselves}} in proportion to our numbers. They have fifty out of a thousand, and we twenty out of threescore. No, no, they are holding a council, and we shall soon <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>them</b> again. But it may be some hours first, and if you will take my advice you will have an hour's sleep, for you are not, as I can see by your eyes, as used to doing without it as I am, {{and there may be}} little rest for any of us this night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Certainly not;--but {{it will be}} an {{annoyance}} which I can bear. You or any {{one else}} would be very much mistaken who would suppose that life out in those places can go on in the same regular way that it does here. Gold beneath the ground is a dangerous thing to touch, and few who have had to do with it have come out much freer from misfortune than myself. As for these people, I don't suppose that I shall <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>them</b> again. I shall send them both word that not a shilling is to be expected from me.' ...|$|E
60|$|At {{the door}} of the next little house, I saw a market-wagon loaded with vegetables, and a smart young pig just driving it away. I had heard of this {{interesting}} family, and took a look as I passed by. A second tidy pig sat blowing the fire; and a third was eating roast-beef, {{as if he had just}} come in from his work. The fourth, I was grieved to see, looked very sulky; for it was evident he had been naughty, and so lost his dinner. The little pig was at the door, crying to get in; and it was sweet to see how kindly the others let him in, wiped his tears, tied on his bib, and brought him his bread and milk. I was very glad to see these young orphans doing so well, and I knew my friends at home would enjoy <b>hearing</b> <b>from</b> <b>them.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Not one, sir. We gave 'em {{the slip}} two hours ago, or {{as soon as}} we saw the ship's masts, being bent on getting afloat in some craft or other, in {{preference}} to stopping with savages any longer. No, Mr. Woolston; no fear of them to-night, for they are miles and miles to leeward, bothered in the channels, where they'll be pretty sartain to pass the night; though you'll <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>'em</b> in the morning. Jim and I took to our land tacks, meeting with a good opportunity, and by running directly in the wind's eye, have come out here. We hid ourselves till the canoes was out of sight, and then we carried sail as hard as we could. So give us a cast and take us aboard the old ship again, Mr. Woolston, if you love a fellow-creatur', and an old shipmate in distress." ...|$|R
50|$|During his spell at Ahlen the {{football}} magazine RUND discovered that Patschinskis grandparents were Polish {{and he would}} be eligible to play for Poland national football team. However, the interest cooled off as the Polish manager had already selected his team of the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Even though the PZPN president had signaled interest for matches after the World Cup, Patschinski did not <b>hear</b> anything <b>from</b> <b>them</b> again.|$|R
