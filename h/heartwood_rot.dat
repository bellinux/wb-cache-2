50|$|Aspen {{trunk rot}} affects only living aspen and {{occasionally}} {{a variety of}} poplar trees. Trembling Aspen Populus tremuloides and Large-tooth Aspen Populus grandidentata are two major hosts of trunk rot. In all infected species, the most obvious sign of rot is a conk on the stem of the tree. A conk is the woody fruiting body of the fungus that forms a triangular shape. Conks are perennial and can survive for up to twenty years. They form about {{five years after the}} initial infection. As the decay progresses, <b>rot</b> within the <b>heartwood</b> occurs. The <b>rot</b> appears as a yellowish-white spongy material with black zone lines surrounding it. The main body of rot occurs in the trunk and stem but basal rot can occur as well. The decayed wood has a distinct wintergreen aroma that signifies trunk rot. At the initial stages, the decay may appear discolored but continue to be hard and firm while at later stages, the rot may becomes brownish and the tree may lose structural strength and snap due to a wind gust or other damaging factor. Aspen trunk rot affects older (50-60 years) trees more than younger trees. Older trees tend to have more wounds and damage. Phellinus tremulae can maintain a resting state for 20 years, so older trees have a greater chance of being infected. Older trees become diseased and die more quickly than younger trees. Stem wounds also increase the opportunities for infection no matter the age of the tree. In order to diagnose aspen trunk rot, conks are the first sign to look for. Perennial conks with concentric growth rings indicate severe decay because each growth ring signifies a season of disease. It takes many years to build up the concentric rings to indicate severe decay. The conks can appear to have a triangular shape and the lower surface is covered in pores. Knots and stem wounds/scars also indicate decay within the aspen tree while cavities and cracks display the inner decay. Aspen trunk rot is a white rotter because the lignin is broken down within the tree, giving the diseased trunk a white appearance.|$|R

Bioassays revealed that among these compounds, only benzoic acid showed significant activity against P. tremulae. An analytical procedure was developed to measure the concentration of benzoic acid in various types of aspen tissue.

However, the amount of benzoic acid present in the gall-bearing trees may not be sufficient to prevent Phellinus decay.

40|$|This chapter investigates biomass, net primary {{productivity}} (NPP), and net ecosystem productivity (NEP) of boreal and temperate forest ecosystems {{in relation to}} stand density and age. Forests may accumulate woody biomass at constant rate for centuries {{and there is little}} evidence of an age-related decline in productivity. Self thinning and management may lead to a loss of tree-individuals {{to the extent that the}} available ground surface is no longer covered, thus leading to a decline in productivity per unit ground area. Carbon-accumulation of old forests is similar to that of young forests at the same yield class and of the same species. However, due to the accumulated mass per area and the increased spread of fungal <b>heartwood</b> <b>rot,</b> old forests become unstable and collapse due to external forces, mainly wind. Since carbon accumulation and collapse are highly asymmetric in time, old stands are rarer than young stands. Forest structure and management, rather than stand age, determine NPP. There is no clear distinction in productivity between primary and managed forest, except that managed forests are generally harvested at an age below 100 years. Although unmanaged forests sustain natural processes, biodiversity â€“ expressed as species richness â€“ is not necessarily higher in unmanaged compared to managed forests...|$|E
40|$|Western redcedar (Thuja plicata) is an {{economically}} and culturally important tree species to British Columbia (BC). Wood from T. plicata is highly valued for being light weight, dimensionally stable and resistant to rot. However, T. plicata silviculture {{is not without}} problems. Reforestation with T. plicata is expensive due to extensive browsing of seedlings by ungulates. Also, woody stems of mature trees can be susceptible to heartwood rotting fungi. Resistance to ungulate browsing positively correlates with the overall abundance of monoterpenoids in foliage, notably the oxygenated monoterpenoid Î±-thujone, while <b>heartwood</b> <b>rot</b> resistance is relative {{to the amount of}} tropolones, a class of compounds derived from monoterpenes, in the wood. To better understand factors that affect monoterpenoid content in young T. plicata foliage, leaves were examined for ontogenetic changes in morphology, anatomy and monoterpenoid content {{during the first year of}} growth. The two morphologically different leaf types, needles and scales, possess different monoterpenoid storage structures and very different chemical contents, punctuated by the absence of Î±-thujone in needles. To determine the genetic basis for the production of foliar monoterpenoids, a transcriptome database was generated from which to draw candidate genes. Complementary DNA profiling was used to determine the differential gene expression between a natural variant lacking foliar monoterpenoids and wild type tree. This analysis yielded more than 600 genes with low or undetectable expression in foliage of the variant, and up to 10000 -fold higher transcript abundance in foliage with resin glands. Amongst the candidate genes was a single monoterpene synthase gene that produced sabinene, the likely monoterpene precursor to Î±-thujone, as its major product in vitro. A second, more comprehensive, transcriptome was generated to identify additional monoterpene synthases from other tissues. Eleven terpene synthase gene fragments were identified, one of which was found to produce terpinolene, the likely precursor of the tropolone Î²-thujaplicin. The transcriptome datasets together with the characterization of monoterpene synthases represents a major first step into understanding the genetics of T. plicata terpenoid based defenses...|$|E
40|$|Brown <b>heartwood</b> <b>rot</b> is {{commonly}} found in mature lemon groves in southwestern Arizona. Two basidiomycete fungi, Antrodia sinuosa and Coniophora eremophila, have been isolated from symptomatic trees. Similarities between the two pathogens include the following: each fungus grows optimally at 30 to 35 Â°C, neither organism produces a fleshy fruiting body, they colonize lemon trees primarily through branch fractures and other non-pruning wounds, and both cause a brown wood rot in infected trees. A major {{difference between the two}} pathogens is that Antrodia forms spore-producing fruiting bodies on infected wood within lemon groves, whereas fruiting on lemon wood infected by Coniophora has not been observed. The rate of wood decay in lemon branches inoculated with Antrodia is at least three times greater than that caused by Coniophora. Wood decay columns produced by either fungus from late spring to early autumn were at least three times larger than those that developed from late autumn to early spring. When inoculated with either pathogen, the length of wood decay columns on branches 10 mm in diameter was numerically smaller than those on branches 20 and 40 mm in diameter. Wood decay on Lisbon lemon branches inoculated with either Antrodia or Coniophora was significantly greater than that on Marsh grapefruit, Orlando tangelo, and Valencia orange. Treatment of lemon branch inoculation sites with azoxystrobin or propiconazole at 20 g of active ingredient per liter of solution reduced the resultant length of wood decay columns by 61 and 77 %, respectively, for Antrodia, and 92 and 85 %, respectively, for Coniophora. When selected desert plants were inoculated, Antrodia produced wood decay columns on Palo Verde, salt cedar, greasewood, and mesquite branches that were much shorter than those recorded on Lisbon lemon branches. On the other hand, Coniophora produced longer wood decay columns on salt cedar and mesquite than on Lisbon lemon, whereas wood rot on lemon was greater than that on Palo Verde and greasewood. Current disease management strategies include minimizing branch fractures and other non-pruning wounds, and periodic inspection of trees and removal of infected branches, including physical removal of all wood infected with Antrodia from the grove site...|$|E

A major {{difference between the two}} pathogens is that Antrodia forms spore-producing fruiting bodies on infected wood within lemon groves, whereas fruiting on lemon wood infected by Coniophora has not been observed. A third fungus, a species of Nodulisporium, recently was recovered from small dead lemon tree branches with an internal white wood rot. Experiments were conducted to compare the severity of wood rot caused by each of these pathogens. The highest rates of wood decay for each pathogen occurred from May through October, when the mean length of wood decay columns for Antrodia, Coniophora and Nodulisporium was 183, 94 and 146 mm, respectively, and the mean air temperature was 29 Â°C. In comparison, the mean length of wood decay columns from November through April for the same pathogens was 35, 18 and 38 mm, respectively, with a mean air temperature of 17 Â°C. When inoculated with Antrodia, Coniophora or Nodulisporium, the length of wood decay columns on 40 - mm-diameter branches was 26, 38 and 24 % larger, respectively, compared to wood decay on 10 -mm-diameter branches. The length of wood decay columns on inoculated Lisbon lemon was always numerically greater than that on tested orange, grapefruit and tangelo trees. Compared to lemon, wood decay columns ranged from 45 (on grapefruit) to 62 %(on orange) shorter when inoculated with Antrodia, 52 (on orange) to 59 % (on tangelo) for Coniophora and 20 (on tangelo) to 51 % (on grapefruit) for Nodulisporium. Compared to non-treated branches, suppression of wood decay {{in the presence of a}} test fungicide ranged from 28 to 79 % for Antrodia, 77 to 91 % for Coniophora and 71 to 92 % for Nodulisporium. For each pathogen, the lowest numerical degree of wood rot suppression occurred in the presence of trifloxystrobin (Flint), whereas the highest level of suppression was observed with propiconazole (Break). On greasewood, mesquite, Palo Verde and salt cedar, the length of wood decay columns ranged from 20 to 60 mm when inoculated with Antrodia, 1 to 63 mm for Coniophora and 24 to 90 mm for Nodulisporium. For all three wood-rotting fungi, resultant wood decay columns were always much greater on lemon compared to tested desert-dwelling plants.

40|$|European aspen (Populus tremula L.) is an {{inherent}} species in Sweden and other Nordic countries. Products from aspen are timber, pulp wood, biofuel and veneer for furniture and matches. Aspen is damaged by fungi, insects and wild habitat. Two main forms of rot are root rot (Armillaria mellea (Vahl.)

But discolored wood {{is the most}} frequent form {{of changes in the}} aspen wood. In the report an overview of the factors causing discolored wood as well as the industrial use and quality of the end products is presented. The study was made at eight locations in Sweden (Lat. 65 Â° N. Long 20 Â° E.; Lat. 64 Â° N. Long 19 Â° E.; Lat. 62 Â° N. Long 15 Â° E.; Lat. 60 Â° N. Long 16 Â° E.; Lat. 60 Â° N.

In the stand ten aspens were sampled, totally 400 aspens. Stand parameters such as stem number, diameter at breast height, height, age, forest type and soil type was registered. The age, height and diameter at breast height of the felled stem was measured. The stem was cut in sections of 1 meter. Age and diameter of the sections was registered. The stem area was examined and the diameter of discolored wood or rot was registered. The mean total age was 33 Â± 10 range 12 - 63 years, the mean height was 16. 0 Â± 3. 3 range 8. 2 - 25. 2 meter and the mean diameter at breast height was 172 Â± 28 range 81 - 340 mm. Most of the stands were growing on light clay till or sandy till. Among the studied 400 aspens 91 % of the stems were discolored. At 1 % of stem height 91 % was discolored and 56 % at 75 % of stem height. Part of the stem, 28 %, had a discolored radius of 21 range 5 - 51 mm at 25 % of stem height (â‰ˆ 4 meters). The discolored volume increased with increasing breast height diameter; 10. 3 % at 153 mm and 19. 1 % at 350 mm. Equations describing discolored volume, %, by total stem volume were constructed.
