Because the four main components of their core product line of canning jars included glass, zinc, rubber, and paper, the Ball company acquired a zinc strip rolling mill to produce metal lids for their glass jars, manufactured rubber sealing rings for the jars, and acquired a paper mill to fabricate the packaging used in shipping their products.

These were initially outfitted with wooden fixed-position de Havilland-built propellers, but had been designed from the onset to accommodate variable-pitch propellers when these became available. The starboard engine drives a hydraulic pump and air compressor, the former being used to actuate the undercarriage and flaps while the latter is used for the braking system; a vacuum pump is also present for the gyroscopic instrumentations. The port engine drives a 500-watt electrical generator. The engine cowling features an inlet that draws cooling air into a tank; a pair of <b>tinned</b> <b>steel</b> oil tanks are also contained within the cowling.

40|$|Another simple antenna {{useful as}} a feed antenna is a {{cylindrical}} horn, a fancy name for a round pipe radiating from the open end. At the proper frequencies, a round pipe acts as a cylindrical waveguide. Energy propagating through the waveguide will continue propagating past an open end, radiating into free space. Several feed antennas start with the unadorned horn and add features to improve performance as a feed antenna. 6. 3. 1 “Coffee can ” feeds “Coffee can ” feed — The “Coffee can ” feed is simply an open-ended circular, or cylindrical, waveguide. Early USA amateur versions 1 used coffee cans as raw material — a 3 -pound can for 23 cm or a one-pound can for 13 cm.
