From these places they traded in <b>Japanese</b> <b>silk,</b> pigments, spices, gold and silver treads, pearls and lacquerware. The most {{profitable}} product in that trade was opium, the smuggling of which became Grill's own private business. During his time in Canton he smuggled [...] "considerable quantities" [...] from India to Macao. It is documented that he in 1767 received a shipment of 150 chests of opium sent from Madras (now known as Chennai) by Jacob Hahr, another supercargo. Consequently, Grill became Sweden's first major drug runner.|$|E

Finding American officers inside the court, Okazaki asked if the trial would be undertaken {{under the name of}} the Emperor, or the Americans. Mitsuse replied that the trial would take place under the name of the emperor. Members of the Japanese Empire Voluntary Army took this seriously and admitted every fact of the crimes as true. On November 7, Okazaki stated the motives for their uprising. He wanted to remove senior statesmen and zaibatsu around the emperor, and wanted to establish a Shōwa Restoration cabinet.

This effect was first discovered in <b>Japanese</b> <b>silks,</b> when the material was folded, optical patterns and colours floated above the actual patterns and colour of the material. This method produced a dramatic effect when Kidner crossed 2 colour bands with a third at a slight angle, resulting in a completely new pattern, with a wave like vertical image hovering into view producing an intense optical dazzle.|$|R

The contrast was sharp, blinding, and distinct; even {{the edges of the}} opening were black; the outer light halted on the threshold and never penetrated within. The warm odor of verbena and dried rose leaves stole from a half-open door somewhere in the cloistered gloom. Guided by it, Clarence presently found himself on the threshold of a low-vaulted room. Two other narrow embrasured windows like the one he had just seen, and a fourth, wider latticed casement, hung with gauze curtains, suffused the apartment with a clear, yet mysterious twilight that seemed its own. The gloomy walls were warmed by bright-fringed bookshelves, topped with trifles of light feminine coloring and adornment. Low easy-chairs and a lounge, small fanciful tables, a dainty desk, gayly colored baskets of worsteds or mysterious kaleidoscopic fragments, and vases of flowers pervaded the apartment with a mingled sense of grace and comfort. There was a womanly refinement in its careless negligence, and even the delicate wrapper of <b>Japanese</b> <b>silk,</b> gathered at the waist and falling in easy folds to the feet of the graceful mistress of this charming disorder, looked a part of its refined abandonment.|$|E

One way to meet this goal was to build a school for samurai and others. Another idea was to rehabilitate those who went against the rules, and Shigekata created a completely new criminal law. He also started a medical school called Saishunkan. In addition, Shigekata and Hori started various new industries involving <b>Japanese</b> paper, <b>silk,</b> and wax.|$|R

50|$|As {{trade between}} the two {{countries}} developed, France became the first importer of <b>Japanese</b> <b>silk,</b> absorbing more than 50% of Japan's raw silk production between 1865 and 1885. Silk remained the center of Franco-Japanese economic relations until the First World War. As of 1875, Lyon had become the world center for silk processing, and Yokohama had become the center for the supply of the raw material. Around 1870, Japan produced about 8.000 tons of silk, with Lyon absorbing half of this production, and 13.000 tons in 1910, becoming the first world producer of silk, although the United States had overtaken France as the first importer of <b>Japanese</b> <b>silk</b> from around 1885.

Permeated with desire to restore lost harmony between humanity and nature, they were reflective of her affinity to Zen minimalism and Shinto traditions. When hanging from blooming cherry trees in the Imperial Garden in Kyoto, white silk veils seemed to vanish in the air, while the yellow silk cut outs of her brother as small boy shimmered between stone foxes in the Fushimi Inari-taisha shrine in remembrance of his love for animals. When her retrospective in cameo was shown in Fukuoka, a visitor said to the artist: “You must have been Japanese in your former life”.|$|R
