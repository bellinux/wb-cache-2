25|$|The {{bodies of}} water for salmon habitat must be clean and oxygenated. One sign of high {{productivity}} and growth rate in the oceans <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> algae. Increased algal levels lead {{to higher levels of}} carbon dioxide in the water, which transfers into living organisms, fostering underwater plants and small organisms, which salmon eat. Algae can filter high levels of toxins and pollutants. Thus, it is essential for algae and other water-filtering agents to not be destroyed in the oceans because they contribute to the well-being of the food chain.|$|E

Every dollar that the government spends is a dollar taken from American workers, regardless whether it is from debt or taxes. Taxes simply redistribute purchasing power, doing so in a particularly inefficient manner, reducing the incentives to produce or hire and borrowing simply forces businesses and investors to anticipate higher taxes later on.|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{potential}} to contribute {{to our understanding of}} adolescent psychological development, empirical investigations of parent-adolescent separation and ego development have <b>been</b> rare. <b>The</b> present study explored the relationship between perceived parental bonding, separation-individuation and ego development. Four hundred ninety adolescents ranging in age from 14 to 18 years, attending a suburban high school in Westchester, were selected from a larger longitudinal study of adolescent development and depression conducted by Pace University. In this study, ego development <b>was</b> measured by <b>the</b> Sentence Completion Test (Loevinger, Redmore and Wessler, 1970); psychological separation <b>was</b> assessed using <b>the</b> Psychological Separation Inventory (Hoffman, 1984); and perceived parental bonding <b>was</b> measured by <b>the</b> Parental Bonding Instrument (Parker, Tupling, and Brown, 1979). Significant findings include: (1) <b>the</b> greater <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> perceived mother and father Overprotection, <b>the</b> lower <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> ego development; (2) <b>the</b> greater <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> perceived mother Care, <b>the</b> greater <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> ego development; (3) greater functional and attitudinal dependence related to higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> ego development; (4) (a) greater functional independence was correlated with higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> perceived mother Overprotection, (b) greater attitudinal independence was correlated with higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> perceived father and mother Overprotection; (c) conflictual dependence was correlated with greater perceived <b>level</b> <b>of</b> mother and father Overprotection, (5) the less functionally, attitudinally, and emotionally independent, <b>the</b> higher <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> perceived mother and father Care, and the more conflictually independent, <b>the</b> higher <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> perceived mother and father Care.

25|$|There are {{a number}} of factors that can lower the {{probability}} of a successful anger management intervention. One such obstacle <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> the individual's motivation. Overall low readiness is an impediment to the effectiveness of anger management due to the lower attendance rates and negative effect on the therapeutic alliance. Involuntary assignment to an anger management program, for example court mandated sessions, will result in a lower average motivation level than voluntary admission. In one study with incarcerated inmates, there was a correlation found between individual readiness and improvement.|$|E
25|$|One {{indicator}} {{to measure}} the technical efficiency of water utilities <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> non-revenue water. In a well-managed utility that level should be below about 25%. In Johannesburg, the estimated level declined from 44% in 2003 to 31% in 2006. In Durban it stood at an estimated average of 31% between 2002 and 2006. In Cape Town the estimates fluctuated significantly between 10% and 37%, suggesting that the estimates may not be reliable. The average level of non-revenue water for South African utilities participating in the International Benchmarking Network for Water and Sanitation Utilities in the 2002-2006 period was 31%.|$|E
25|$|Most {{researchers}} found {{that there is a}} close linkage between geographic features and telecommunication application; this linkage shows that geographic accessibility relates significantly to telecommunication access. Generally, the geographic feature of each region from East to Central to West is marked by plain, hill and mountain respectively. The second factors are demographic indicators; the population density of these regions appears inversely opposite their geographical elevation: the Eastern region has the highest population density, followed by the Central region, while the West, the most geographically elevated, has the lowest population density. The third factor <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> economic development in these regions, which paints a similar picture: the level of economic development is closely related to Internet access.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the basic configuration of a station, various features set certain types of station apart. The first <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> the tracks. Stations are often sited where a road crosses the railway: unless the crossing is a level crossing, the road and railway will be at different levels. The platforms will often be raised or lowered relative to the station entrance: the station buildings may be on either level, or both. The other arrangement, where the station entrance and platforms {{are on the same}} level, is also common, but is perhaps rarer in urban areas, except when the station is a terminus. Elevated stations are more common, not including metro stations. Stations located at level crossings can be problematic if the train blocks the roadway while it stops, causing road traffic to wait {{for an extended period of}} time.|$|E
25|$|Another factor <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> privacy {{to which}} a person can be assured - for example, some parts of a home may {{be seen from the}} outside or there may be a {{possibility}} of others walking in. The expectation of privacy may be confined to the home and sometimes the backyard. Inside the home, it may be restricted to the bedroom or just the bathroom. If a person is not alone, their comfort in removing clothing in front of another person will generally depend on the nature of a relationship of those who jointly occupy the same private space, as well as the attitudes of others to nudity. Besides the nature of a relationship, attitudes and incidences of nudity will also depend on the level of inhibition that each person has, as well as the level of privacy to which that they can be assured. Sometimes a person may unintentionally intrude on a person who is in the nude, which may lead to embarrassment of {{one or both of the}} people. The nude person may seek to quickly cover their private parts, while the clothed person may turn away, but this also depends on cultural differences and the relationship of the people.|$|E
25|$|As {{electric}} fish mature, some taxa develop {{differences in}} EOD {{between males and}} females (i.e. sexual dimorphism). Typically, male electric fish have lower EOD frequency and longer EOD duration than females; among males, the dominant and largest fish generally possesses the lowest frequency. For example, measurements made in Sternopygus marucus (Hagedorn, 1986) showed that males usually generate EOD at about 80Hz, while females generate EOD at around 150Hz. Such differences in EOD between the sexes {{can be traced back to}} changes in the action potential in electrocytes. As electric fish mature from the juvenile stage, male fish grow larger with longer and thicker tails, which might result in larger electric organs that generate lower frequency EODs. One of the physiological factors that have been proven to contribute to the sexual dimorphism of EODs <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> teleost hormone- androgen 11-keto-testosterone (11-KT) and estrogen. Experiments shown that by injecting 11-KT into female electric fishes, not only did their EOD waveforms and frequencies become closer to that of the males, but their tuberous electroreceptors were also modified to be able to detect signals according to the newly transformed EOD properties. However, when estrogen was applied, the EODs of male electric fish gradually became closer to the female EODs.|$|E

500|$|Bumblebees do not {{exhibit the}} [...] "bee dances" [...] used by honeybees to tell other workers the {{locations}} of food sources. Instead, when they return from a successful foraging expedition, they run excitedly around in the nest for several minutes before going out to forage once more.

Another stimulant to foraging activity <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> food reserves in the colony.
