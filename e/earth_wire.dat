25|$|Earth leakage {{circuit breaker}} (ELCB) — This detects current in the <b>earth</b> <b>wire</b> {{directly}} rather than detecting imbalance. They {{are no longer}} seen in new installations as they can not detect any dangerous condition where the current is returning to earth by another route - such as via a person {{on the ground or}} via plumbing.

25|$|A third wire, {{called the}} bond (or <b>earth)</b> <b>wire,</b> is often {{connected}} between non-current-carrying metal enclosures and earth ground. This conductor provides protection from electric shock due to accidental contact of circuit conductors with the metal chassis of portable appliances and tools. Bonding all non-current-carrying metal parts into one complete system ensures {{there is always}} a low electrical impedance path to ground sufficient to carry any fault current {{for as long as it}} takes for the system to clear the fault. This low impedance path allows the maximum amount of fault current, causing the overcurrent protection device (breakers, fuses) to trip or burn out as quickly as possible, bringing the electrical system to a safe state. All bond wires are bonded to ground at the main service panel, as is the neutral/identified conductor if present.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} several notable power outages in Auckland. The five-week-long 1998 Auckland power crisis blacked out much of the CBD after a cascade failure {{occurred}} on four underground cables in Mercury Energy's sub-transmission network. The 2006 Auckland Blackout interrupted supply to the CBD and many inner suburbs after an <b>earth</b> <b>wire</b> shackle at Transpower's Otahuhu substation broke and short-circuited the lines supplying the inner city. In 2009, much of the northern and western suburbs, {{as well as all}} of Northland, experienced a blackout when a forklift accidentally came into contact with the Otahuhu to Henderson 220kV line, the only major line supplying the region. Transpower spent $1.25billion in the early 2010s reinforcing the supply into and across Auckland, including a 400kV-capable transmission line from the Waikato River to Brownhill substation (operated at 220kV initially), and 220kV underground cables between Brownhill and Pakuranga, and between Pakuranga and Albany via the CBD. These reduced the Auckland Region's reliance on Otahuhu substation and northern and western Auckland's reliance on the Otahuhu to Henderson line.|$|E

50|$|Stations at low {{frequencies}} like shortwave, {{and especially the}} mediumwave/longwave AM broadcasting bands, require grounding or <b>earthing</b> <b>wires</b> {{to be buried in}} the soil in a radial pattern, {{in order to have a}} proper ground plane for the large mast radiators used as radio antennas at their long wavelengths.|$|R
2500|$|RCDs operate by {{measuring}} the current balance between two conductors using a differential current transformer. [...] This measures the difference between current flowing through the live conductor and that returning through the neutral conductor. [...] If these do not sum to zero, there is a leakage of current to somewhere else (to earth/ground or to another circuit), and the device will open its contacts. Operation {{does not require a}} fault current to return through the <b>earth</b> <b>wire</b> in the installation; the trip will operate just as well if the return path is through plumbing, contact with the ground or any other current path. Automatic disconnection and a measure of shock protection is therefore still provided even if the earth wiring of the installation is damaged or incomplete.|$|E

50|$|In this article, when {{comparing}} different wiring methods or systems {{the focus is}} on the number of wires connecting the switches to each other. Sometimes an additional wire is present in each cable to carry an unswitched neutral or hot wire which passes through the switch mounting box, but is not normally connected to the switch. If the switch has a pilot light or a receptacle, additional hot or neutral connections to the device may be required. Grounding (<b>earthing)</b> <b>wires</b> are not counted.|$|R
40|$|Single-phase {{positive}} sequence modelling {{is often used}} in power systems when power flows and short circuit analysis are assessed. Of course, the use of single-phase {{positive sequence}} modelling assumes purely three-phase configurations and perfectly symmetrical ones so that single-phase modelling considers that all the phase conductors behave in the same way. When considering the physical reality of power networks, this assumption can be questionable and the behaviors of all the system conductors including the passive ones (<b>earth</b> <b>wires</b> for overhead lines, metallic screens and armours for cables and enclosures for gas insulated lines) is completely unknown. Therefore, the present multiconductor cell analysis (MCA) becomes necessary, since it allows one to achieve great precision results on the regimes of both phase conductors and passive conductors. MCA offers a powerful tool in order to validate (or less) approximated and simplified computation methods. In particular, for single and double circuit overhead lines (OHLs), the current phasors induced in the <b>earth</b> <b>wires</b> and the ground return current alongside the line can be directly computed by MCA in steady state and faulty regimes. It is worth noting that, for faulty regimes, MCA allows also evaluating the approximation degree and validity field of screening factors k...|$|R

50|$|The {{cause of}} the {{blackout}} was {{traced back to the}} Otahuhu sub-station, the city's main transmission switching station. A corroded shackle connecting the Otahuhu to Penrose 220 kV line's <b>earth</b> <b>wire</b> had dislodged in 90 km/h winds, letting the <b>earth</b> <b>wire</b> fall across the 220 kV line and the 110 kV busbar below it, tripping both the line and three sections of the busbar, disconnecting lines to Mount Roskill, Penrose and Pakuranga. The trip also disconnected Otahuhu B and Southdown power stations from the national grid. The trip left only one line, the now-dismantled Arapuni to Pakuranga 110 kV line, supplying Pakuranga, Penrose, and the central city. Eight seconds after the failure, this line tripped from overloading, leaving Penrose, Pakuranga, and central city substations without power, as well as parts of Otahuhu and Mount Roskill substations.|$|E

50|$|The {{installation}} {{process for}} wrapped cables involves passing a drum of cable {{around and around}} the host conductor as the carrying device moves across the span. For installation on hosts within 10 m of the ground (medium or low voltage overhead lines), {{it is possible to}} pull the wrapping machine by hand from the ground below the line. However, a radio controlled power unit using batteries or a petrol engine is normally required when the host conductor is on a high voltage transmission line. Wrapped cables can be applied to <b>earth</b> <b>wires</b> (ground wires, shield wires) on power transmission lines and to phase conductors on transmission, sub-transmission or distribution lines.|$|R
