2500|$|The French {{governor}} {{attempts to}} speak to Dulness but cannot {{be heard over the}} French horn sound that emerges, so the pupil tells his story. The [...] "governor" [...] is an English nobleman who went to school and college without learning anything, then went abroad on the Grand Tour, on which [...] "Europe he saw, and Europe saw him too" [...] (294). He went to Paris and Rome and [...] "he saunter'd Europe round,/ And gather'd ev'ry Vice on Christian ground" [...] (B IV 311–312). At the end of his travels, he is [...] "perfectly well bred,/ With nothing but a Solo in his head" [...] (323–4), and he has returned to England with a despoiled nun following him. She is pregnant with his child (or the student's) and destined for the life of a prostitute (a kept woman), and the lord <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for Parliament so that he can avoid arrest. Dulness welcomes the three—the devious student, the brainless lord, and the spoiled nun—and spreads her own cloak about the girl, which [...] "frees from sense of Shame." ...|$|E

60|$|Before recess {{it began}} to be known among them that Pony <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> off, because his father had made him come back, and then they did think he was somebody; {{and as soon as}} they got out at recess they all crowded round him and began to praise him up, and everything, and to tell him that they would run off, too, if their fathers sent them back; and so he began to be glad that he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do it. They asked him when he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> off, and he told them they would see; and pretty soon it was {{understood}} that he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> off the same night.|$|R

2500|$|A Charlie Brown Christmas was {{completed}} just ten days shy of its national broadcast premiere. All involved believed the special {{would be an}} unmitigated disaster. Melendez first saw the completed animation at a showing in a theater {{in the days before}} its premiere, turning to his crew of animators and remarking, [...] "My golly, we've killed it." [...] Melendez was embarrassed, but one of the animators, Ed Levitt, was more positive regarding the special, telling him it was [...] "the best special [...] ever make [...] This show <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for a hundred years." [...] Mendelson was similar in his assumptions of the show's quality, and when he showed the film to network executives in New York, their opinions were also negative. Their complaints included the show's slow pace, the music not fitting, and the animation too simple. [...] "I really believed, if it hadn't been scheduled for the following week, there's no way they were gonna broadcast that show," [...] Mendelson later said. Executives had invited television critic Richard Burgheim of Time to view the special, and debated as to whether showing it to him would be a good idea. His review, printed the following week, was positive, praising the special as unpretentious and writing that [...] "A Charlie Brown Christmas is one children's special this season that bears repeating." ...|$|E

6000|$|The men <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> him up <b>to</b> Fort Govindghar. And [...] "running up" [...] is a {{performance}} almost as undignified as the Frog March.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I ain't afraid, gov'nor. All for {{the good}} of the cause. The streets <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> with blood, so they say." [...] He spoke with a grim relish.

6000|$|... "If you're not {{altogether}} {{satisfied with the}} post Don Arturo gave you, another could be got," [...] he said.

I've been asked {{to find out if}} you would undertake the duties?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I'm not. I'm talking sense. I don't {{know who}} Miss Mariner's parents may have been--I never enquired--but anyone can see she's a lady born and bred. But {{do you suppose}} the path of true love <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> smooth, for all that? Not it! She's got a 'ard time ahead of her, that poor girl!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The I.W.W. <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> {{it if you}} sulk indoors as {{you have}} done lately," [...] yelled Kurt. He thought that would fetch his father {{stamping}} out, but he had reckoned falsely. There was no further sound. Leaving the room in high dudgeon, Kurt hurried out to catch the hired men near at hand and to order them back to work. They trudged off surlily toward the barn.|$|E
60|$|He {{carefully}} avoids decent society, {{and would}} rather dine off a steak at the 'One Tun' with Sam Snaffle the jockey, Captain O'Rourke, {{and two or}} three other notorious turf robbers, than with the choicest company in London. He likes to announce at 'Rummer's' that he <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> down and spend his Saturday and Sunday in a friendly way with Hocus, the leg, at his little box near Epsom; where, if report speak true, many 'rummish plants' are concocted.|$|E
6000|$|... "I reckon {{that is good}} enough," [...] Jerry said, {{wiping the}} sweat from his forehead. [...] "Ef there is but enough of it, it is the biggest thing that ever was struck. There ain't no saying how rich it is, but I will bet my boots it's over five hundred ounces to the ton. It ain't in nature that it <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> far like that, but it is good enough for anything. Well, what is the next thing, Harry?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] said Jordan dryly, [...] "I don't quite think Jimmy will do that. In some respects, I {{understand}} {{him better than}} you do. He wants to save the girl all the sorrow and disgrace he can, but he <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> her father out of this city. Jimmy's not exactly clever, and it's quite likely he'll mix up things when he meets Merril; but, for all that, I guess he'll carry out just what he means to do. Somehow, he generally does. That's {{the kind of man}} he is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I knew it," [...] said Miss Rosetta {{in a tone}} {{of bitter}} assurance. [...] "I could have told you so. Charlotte wouldn't even let me know that Jane was ill.

60|$|He was {{occupied}} in dressing himself, and was taking extraordinary pains to destroy {{all traces of}} the natural slovenliness of his appearance. This was precisely what I expected. A vagabond like Mr. Jay knows the importance of giving himself a respectable look when he <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> the risk of changing a stolen bank-note. At five minutes past ten o'clock he had given the last brush to his shabby hat and the last scouring with bread-crumb to his dirty gloves. At ten minutes past ten {{he was in the}} street, {{on his way to the}} nearest cab-stand, and I and my subordinates were close on his heels.|$|E

6000|$|The surgeon interposed. [...] "Don't dwell needlessly, Sir Patrick, on {{the gloomy}} view," [...] he rejoined. [...] "The opinion I have formed has, thus far, no {{positive}} grounds to rest on. I am guessing rightly, as I believe, {{but at the}} same time I am guessing in the dark. Appearances may have misled me. There may be reserves of vital force in Mr. Delamayn's constitution which I don't suspect. I am here to learn a lesson--not to see a prediction fulfilled. I know his health is broken, and I believe he <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> this race at his own proper peril. Don't feel too sure beforehand of the event. The event may prove me to be wrong." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nobody {{wants you}} to run Lion's Head for a while yet," [...] his mother returned, scornfully. [...] "Jackson <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> Lion's Head. He'll be home the end of June, and I'll run Lion's Head till he gets here. You talk," [...] she went on, [...] "as if it was in your hands to break with Cynthy, or throw away the chance with her. The way I look at it, she's broke with you, and you ha'n't got any chance with her. Oh, Jeff," [...] she {{suddenly}} appealed to him, [...] "tell me all about it! What have you been up to?
