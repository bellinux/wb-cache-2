40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{research}} focuses the calibration of predictive {{models of}} outdoor thermal comfort through field studies. The {{objective is to}} verify their applicability in outdoor spaces of Grande Sao Paulo, a Brazilian metropolitan area with over 18 million inhabitants. The method adopted is experimental inductive (field research of micro-climatic variables and subjective answers) and <b>deductive</b> (<b>simulation</b> and calibration of predictive models). The field research consists of 36 different micro-climatic scenarios and over 900 applied questionnaires (these field studies are considered in another paper whose abstract was also sent for evaluation). The calibrations were done for twent...|$|E
40|$|Simulation means {{experimenting with}} a model aimed at {{analysing}} the behaviour of a dynamic system. The causal relationships of ecological and biological systems are often not completely known, which hampers the application of quantitative and even qualitative <b>deductive</b> <b>simulation</b> methodologies. If empirical studies that describe the system's behaviour are available, case-based methods {{can be used to}} develop a behaviour model from a set of data, i. e. prototypical cases. In contrast to purely inductive methods, case-based approaches directly apply cases to a given situation. Thereby, the specificity of cases is preserved for simulation. Two approaches and their applications illustrate principles, perspectives, and problems of case-based simulation. Keywords: Fuzzy-based Inductive Reasoning; Case-Based Simulation; Prediction; Ecological Applications; Medical Applications 1 Introduction Simulation means the experimentation with models. Biological and ecological simulations are typically [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Urban {{watershed}} management poses a very challenging problem {{due to the}} various sources of pollution {{and there is a}} need to develop optimal management models that can facilitate the process of identifying optimal water quality management strategies. A screening level, comprehensive, and integrated computational methodology is developed for the management of point and non-point sources of pollution in urban watersheds. The methodology is based on linking macro-level water quality simulation models with efficient nonlinear constrained optimization methods for urban {{watershed management}}. The use of macro-level simulation models in lieu of the traditional and complex <b>deductive</b> <b>simulation</b> models is investigated in the optimal management framework for urban watersheds. Two different types of macro-level simulation models are investigated for application to watershed pollution problems namely explicit inductive models and simplified deductive models. Three different types of inductive modeling techniques are used to develop macro-level simulation models ranging from simple regression methods to more complex and nonlinear methods such as artificial neural networks and genetic functions. A new genetic algorithm (GA) based technique of inductive mode...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper proposes an {{efficient}} technique for transition delay fault coverage measurement in synchronous sequential circuits. The proposed strategy {{is based on}} a combination of multi-valued algebra simulation, critical path tracing and <b>deductive</b> fault <b>simulation.</b> The main advantages of the proposed approach are that it is highly computationally efficient with respect to state-of-the-art fault simulation techniques, and that it encompasses different delay sizes in one simulation pass without resorting to an improved transition fault model. Preliminary results on ITC' 99 benchmarks show that the gain in terms of CPU time is up to one order of magnitude compared to previous existing techniques...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} different {{thermal comfort}} models and empirical verification for {{assessment of the}} thermal conditions of transitional spaces {{in the city of}} São Paulo, Brazil. The method adopted is <b>deductive,</b> performing <b>simulations</b> of predictive models, and experimental inductive, considering field research of micro-climatic variables and subjective answers. The thermal comfort predictive models considered were computationally processed. For the empirical verification, two case studies (one, semi-outdoor; the other, semi-indoor) were took into account, with the application of 886 questionnaires in a total of 24 different micro-climatic conditions. The results of the computational simulations were compared to the ones of the empirical field research. Considering the results found, the most appropriated model showed to be the Neutral Operative Temperature. Using the empirical data gathered, this index was calibrated through the proposal of a new equation for even better predictions of thermal comfort in transitional spaces in São Paulo, Brazil...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} the work in this thesis is {{concerned}} with the investigation and development of indirect measurement techniques. The methodology adopted is a combination of practical experimental, analytical <b>deductive</b> reasoning and <b>simulation</b> studies. This has led to proposals for a number of indirect tyre pressure monitoring systems, which are able to detect pressure loss under specific circumstances. The outcome overall is a proposal for a new supervisory system comprising of a modular framework, allowing various algorithms and techniques to be implemented in a complementary manner as they emerge and data sources become available. A number of contributions to the field have been made, which to the knowledge of the author, provide potential for further algorithm development and are imminently applicable given the above. The methods include a tyre pressure diagnosis via a wheel angular velocity comparator, the development of a model-based tyre pressure diagnosis via application of an unknown input observer and a parameter estimation scheme, a model-based tyre pressure diagnosis approach via an enhanced Kalman filter configured to estimate states including the input, a model-based tyre pressure diagnosis via cautious least squares, an investigation and critique {{of the effects of the}} choice of sampling interval on discrete-time models and estimation thereof. It is considered, that the extensive literature review provides a valuable historic insight into the tyre fault detection problem. It is clear, from the development and testing of the algorithms (and also the literature), that no single indirect pressure detection method is able to reliably detect changes in all driving scenarios which the regulations typically stipulate (depending on jurisdiction). In the absence of any information about the road input, the majority of the detection work must be shouldered by the wheel angular velocity comparator algorithm. As image recognition and sensor technology develops, it becomes possible to make estimates about the road surface and this removes some of the uncertainty on the input of the model-based parameter estimation approaches. Further work is detailed which goes some way towards realising the next steps in a development cycle suitable for a vehicle manufacturer to take through to the implementation stage...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a research that proposes a thermal comfort index, allowing the verification of the thermal adequacy of urban {{spaces in the}} city of Sao Paulo, the greatest Brazilian metropolitan area, with over eighteen million inhabitants. The method adopted is experimental inductive (field research of micro-climatic variables and subjective answers) and <b>deductive</b> (<b>simulation</b> of predictive models). The field research consists of seventy-two different micro-climatic scenarios and seventeen hundred and fifty applied questionnaires. The simulations performed for the further comparison with the proposed thermal index are presented. The simulations consider twenty different predictive models, which original interpretative scales were obtained in literature. The calibrated interpretative scales are considered based on the results found. Last, simulations were performed to correlate the results from the empirical research with the results from the calibrated predictive models, considering again the previous results, but now comparing and discussing them with the results from the simulations done with the proposed calibrations. Finally, the empirical data is treated through multiple linear regression analysis, providing a simple and easy-to-use empirical equation to be also used as predictive model. The results from this equation are compared with those from the calibrated predictive models, showing that, for the specific case of Sao Paulo, they present better correlations with data gathered. Concluding, the methods used provided a simple, easy-to-use and reliable thermal comfort index to assess outdoor thermal comfort in Sao Paulo...|$|E
