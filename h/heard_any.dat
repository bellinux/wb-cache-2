Nancy Altman, who shared an office with Thomas at the Department of Education, testified that she heard {{virtually}} everything Thomas {{said over the}} course of two years, and never <b>heard</b> <b>any</b> sexist or offensive comment. Altman did not find it credible that Thomas could have engaged in the conduct alleged by Hill, without any of the dozens of women he worked with noticing it. Senator Alan K. Simpson questioned why Hill met, dined, and spoke by phone with Thomas on various occasions after they no longer worked together.|$|E
25|$|Jesper Strömblad formed In Flames {{to write}} music that {{combined}} the melodic guitar style of Iron Maiden with {{the brutality of}} death metal, something which Jesper stated he had never <b>heard</b> <b>any</b> band do. In writing songs, Jesper also decided {{to make use of}} keyboards, something which was (at the time) uncommon in death metal. Ever since In Flames' debut studio album, Lunar Strain, the band has made use of keyboards. Despite their sometimes heavy use of keyboards in their music, they still refuse to recruit a full-time keyboardist.|$|E

As of 23 March, no candidates had come forward and the newspaper stated that their reporters had not <b>heard</b> <b>any</b> rumours about potential candidates either. On the day prior to the nomination meeting, still no candidates had come forward, despite discussions on Frederick Moss as a suitable representative. Moss had declined becoming a candidate due to private engagements.|$|E
25|$|Zhou's diaries {{and letters}} from {{his time in}} Tokyo show a deep {{interest}} in politics and current events, in particular, the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the Bolsheviks' new policies. He began to read avidly Chen Duxiu's progressive and left-leaning magazine, New Youth. He probably read some early Japanese works on Marx, {{and it has been}} claimed that he even attended Kawakami Hajime's lectures at Kyoto University. Kawakami was an important figure in the early history of Japanese Marxism, and his translations and articles influenced a generation of Chinese communists. However, it now seems unlikely that Zhou met him or <b>heard</b> <b>any</b> of his lectures. Zhou's diaries also show his concern over Chinese student strikes in Japan in May 1918, when the Chinese government failed to send the students' scholarships, but he apparently was not deeply involved in the protest. His active role in political movements began after his return to China.|$|E
25|$|The Silverman {{trial was}} unusual in many aspects, namely the rare {{combination}} of a mother/son team {{and the fact that}} no body was ever recovered. Nonetheless, the jury was unanimous in voting to convict them not only of murder but of 117 other charges including robbery, burglary, conspiracy, grand larceny, illegal weapons possession, forgery and eavesdropping on their first poll on the subject. The judge also took the unusual step of ordering Kimes not to speak to the media even after the jury had been sequestered {{as a result of her}} passing a note to New York Times reporter David Rhode in court. The judge threatened to have Kimes handcuffed during further court appearances if she persisted and restricted her telephone access to calls to her lawyers. The judge contended that Kimes was attempting to influence the jury as they may have seen or <b>heard</b> <b>any</b> such interviews, and that there would be no cross-examination as there would be in court. Kimes had earlier chosen to not take the stand in her own defense after the judge ruled that prosecutors could question her about the previous conviction on slavery charges.|$|E

500|$|Short cites other English composers {{who are in}} debt to Holst, in {{particular}} William Walton and Benjamin Britten, and suggests that Holst's influence may have been felt further afield. Above all, Short recognises Holst as a composer for the people, who believed it was a composer's duty to provide music for practical purposes—festivals, celebrations, ceremonies, Christmas carols or simple hymn tunes. Thus, says Short, [...] "many people who may never have <b>heard</b> <b>any</b> of [...] major works... have nevertheless derived great pleasure from hearing or singing such small masterpieces as the carol 'In the Bleak Midwinter'".|$|E
500|$|Breaking Benjamin's musical {{style is}} {{primarily}} classified as hard rock and alternative rock, more specifically post-grunge and alternative metal, and has commonly been {{noted for its}} consistency. Corey Apar felt that [...] "Breaking Benjamin are nothing if not consistent", and Alex Young felt that [...] "Breaking Benjamin {{is one of the}} few modern rock bands on the radio that, if you have <b>heard</b> <b>any</b> song in its catalog prior, could be immediately recognized." [...] Despite a complete lineup change prior to the release of Dark Before Dawn, Dan Marsicano stated, [...] "Breaking Benjamin hardly deviate from the hooky jams that were present on Dear Agony. They have had an established sound since their breakout We Are Not Alone – hard-edged riffs with emotional upheaval – and that isn't tampered with on Dark Before Dawn." ...|$|E
500|$|Aristotle however {{suggested}} that swallows and other birds hibernated. [...] This belief persisted {{as late as}} 1878, when Elliott Coues listed the titles of no less than 182 papers dealing with the hibernation of swallows. Even the [...] "highly observant" [...] Gilbert White, in his posthumously published 1789 The Natural History of Selborne, quoted a man's story about swallows being found in a chalk cliff collapse [...] "while he was a schoolboy at Brighthelmstone", though the man denied being an eyewitness. However, he also writes that [...] "as to swallows being found in a torpid state during the winter in the Isle of Wight or any part of this country, I never <b>heard</b> <b>any</b> such account worth attending to", and that if early swallows [...] "happen to find frost and snow they immediately withdraw for a time—a circumstance this much more in favour of hiding than migration", since he doubts they would [...] "return {{for a week or}} two to warmer latitudes".|$|E

500|$|Stockhausen, {{along with}} John Cage, {{is one of}} the few avant-garde composers to have succeeded in {{penetrating}} the popular consciousness ( [...] ; [...] ). The Beatles included his face on the cover of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band [...] This reflects his influence on the band's own avant-garde experiments as well as the general fame and notoriety he had achieved by that time (1967). In particular, [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] (1967) and [...] "Revolution 9" [...] (1968) were influenced by Stockhausen's electronic music ( [...] ; [...] ). Stockhausen's name, and the perceived strangeness and supposed unlistenability of his music, was even a punchline in cartoons, as documented on a page on the official Stockhausen web site (...) [...] Perhaps the most caustic remark about Stockhausen was attributed to Sir Thomas Beecham. Asked [...] "Have you <b>heard</b> <b>any</b> Stockhausen?", he is alleged to have replied, [...] "No, but I believe I have trodden in some" [...] ( [...] , annotated on 366: [...] "Apocryphal; source unknown").|$|E
500|$|Within {{months of}} the marriage, Anne was {{pregnant}} but the baby, a girl, was stillborn in May. Anne recovered at the spa town of Tunbridge Wells, {{and over the next}} two years, she gave birth to two daughters in quick succession, Mary and Anne Sophia. In early 1687, within a matter of days, George and his two young daughters caught smallpox, and Anne suffered another miscarriage. George recovered, but both his daughters died. Lady Russell wrote that George and Anne had [...] "taken [...] very heavily. The first relief of that sorrow proceeded from the threatening of a greater, the Prince being so ill of a fever. I never <b>heard</b> <b>any</b> relation more moving than that of seeing them together. Sometimes they wept, sometimes they mourned in words; then sat silent, hand in hand; he sick in bed, and she the carefullest nurse to him that can be imagined." [...] He returned to Denmark for a two-month visit in mid-1687, while Anne remained in England. Later that year, after his return, Anne gave birth to another dead child, this time a son.|$|E

One dialogue, Protagoras, begins in dramatic form but quickly proceeds to Socrates' narration of a conversation he had previously with the sophist for whom the dialogue is named; this narration continues uninterrupted till the dialogue's end.|$|E
