40|$|Abstract- Fuel leakage in the {{pre-filter}} bowl of {{a diesel}} engine feed pump is the common problem in the field. The leakage of fuel is mainly due to the method of assembly and design of the components. Though the threaded fasteners are easy for maintenance and low cost in the assembly of the components, they are not advisable due to its limitation of loosing the threaded fastener under the dynamic loading. A case study {{has been done in}} the industry to reduce the rejection of feed pump due to leakage of fuel in pre <b>filter</b> <b>bowl</b> of a diesel engine. In this paper an effort is made to identify the factors which cause the leakage of the fuel. It is found that due to deformation in the wire clip and <b>filter</b> <b>bowl</b> is causing the major problem. Hence analysis of the existing design is made and suggested the improved design using Finite Element Analysis...|$|E
40|$|Filtration {{of molten}} {{aluminium}} using porous reticulated ceramic foam {{was developed in}} 1974 by SELEE Corporation. Since that time, there have been significant technical advances in <b>filter</b> <b>bowl</b> design and construction, preheat systems, development of fine pore size filters, development of compact two-stage filtration systems, filter gasket materials, and equipment automation. One area that has remained relatively unchanged has been the refractory filter material technology. The refractory material utilized {{by all of the}} major cast house filter suppliers is based on an alumina aggregate grain bonded with aluminium phosphate (AlPO 4). This filter material, commonly referred to as “PBA ” in the aluminium industry, has become an industry wide standard and accounts for nearly 99 % of the filters supplied to cast houses worldwide. There are significant technical limitations of PBA filters in terms of refractory performance, as well as potential environmental, health and safety concerns. This paper describes the development of a cost effective replacement filter material that overcomes the limitations of PBA filters. The new material utilizes a low expansion – low modulus aggregate material and a non-phosphate bond. The result is a significant reduction in mechanical failures during use, improved filtration performance and elimination of the issue of potential environmental, health and safety concerns...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA pilot {{has been}} {{designed}} to study the mechanisms associated with liquid aluminum filtrationthrough ceramic foam filters (CFFs). Before entering the <b>filtering</b> <b>bowl,</b> the liquid metal isseeded with massive artificial inclusions. A theoretical analysis of the filtration of massiveinclusions shows that there are two preponderant deposition mechanisms, i. e., direct interceptionand sedimentation, which explain qualitatively the effect of the operating conditions on themeasured filtration efficiency. Furthermore, it is observed that the filtration efficiency measuredby two Coulter counters reaches a minimum value for a diameter close to 30 µm. This nonmonotonoustrend {{can be explained by the}} coexistence of two populations of inclusions,intentionally added massive ones and oxide films. It is expected that oxide films are the mostnumerous inclusion type for diameters less than 25 µm and have an apparent volume muchlarger than their absolute volume (contrary to massive inclusions), leading to a higher filtrationefficiency. In addition, a metallographic analysis of spent filters shows that the density of thecaptured massive inclusions decreases exponentially between the filter inlet and the filter outlet. The initial filter coefficient can be derived, which is equal to 25 m^- 1 for a 30 -ppi filter grade(with a specific surface area of 1610 m^- 1), SiC inclusions 50 µm in diameter, and a filtrationvelocity of 0. 9 cm. s^- 1...|$|R
40|$|This {{evaluation}} provides criticality {{safety controls}} for the cementation processing in Glovebox HA- 2 OMB at the Plutonium Finishing Plant. Slag and crucible residues from Pu button making will be blended with Portland cement in 5 k-in. diam. x 7 -in. tall cans, for eventual disposition in special DOT 17 C drums. A maximum of 180 g Pu is allowed per liquid-bearing container (mixing <b>bowl,</b> <b>filter</b> funnel, or cement can). In this SD revision, three separate areas with 500 g Pu limits each are established; the airlock cell for input S&C cans, the reaction- and mixing-process area, and a cemented-can storage area. Number and spacing of containers within an area is not restricted, for areas spaced 6 inches apart. Acid addition in the reaction stage {{is allowed to}} the extent that plutonium dissolution will not occur...|$|R
40|$|The {{vibratory}} bowl feeder {{is the oldest}} and still most common approach to the automated feeding (orienting) of industrial parts. In this paper we consider a class of vibratory <b>bowl</b> <b>filters</b> that can be described by removing polygonal sections from the track; we refer to this class of filters as imps. For an n-sided convex polygonal part and m-sided convex polygonal trap, we give an O((n + m) log(n + m)) algorithm to decide if the part will be rejected by the trap, and an O((nrn(n + m)) l+’) algorithm which deals with non-convex parts and traps. We then consider the problem of designing traps for a given part, and consider two rectilinear subclasses, balconies and gap ~. We give linear and 0 (n²) algorithms for designing feeders and have tested the results with physical experiments using a commercial inline vibratory feeder. Our algorithms can be tested using online java applets...|$|R

In this paper, the authors consider a class of vibratory <b>bowl</b> <b>filters</b> that can be described by removing polygonal sections from the track; this class of filters {{is referred to as}} traps. For an n-sided polygonal part and an m-sided polygonal trap, an O(n² m log n) algorithm is given to decide whether the part in a specific orientation will safely move across the trap or will fall through the trap and thus be filtered out. For an n-sided convex polygonal part and m-sided convex polygonal trap, this bound is improved to O((n+m) log n). Furthermore, the authors show how to design various trap shapes, ranging from simple traps to general polygons, which will filter out {{all but one of the}} different stable orientations of a given part. Although the runtimes of the design algorithms are exponential in the number of tra...|$|R
