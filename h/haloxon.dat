40|$|The paper {{describes}} the inhibition of mouse acetylcholinesterase (AChE; EC 3. 1. 1. 7) and mouse, human, and horse butyrylcholinesterase (BChE; EC 3. 1. 1. 8) by 5 - 2 -(tert-butylamino) - 1 -hy-droxyethyl-m-phenylene-bis(dimethylcarbamate) hydrochloride (bambuterol) and by O,O-bis-(2 -chloroethyl) -O-(3 -chloro- 4 -methylcoumarin- 7 -yl) phosphate (<b>haloxon).</b> The <b>haloxon</b> inhibi-tion rate constant (ki) for mouse BChE was 3. 7 x 10 7 min– 1 mol– 1 dm 3, which was 40 -fold {{higher than the}} rate constant for mouse AChE. Bambuterol inhibition of horse BChE (ki = 2. 1 105 min– 1 mol– 1 dm 3) was about 25 -fold slower than that of human or mouse BChE, whereas the respective <b>haloxon</b> inhibition of horse BChE (ki = 1. 2 x 10 7 min– 1 mol– 1 dm 3) was about 2 - 3 -fold slower. Sequence alignments and the computational model of the three-dimensional structure of horse BChE suggest that residues inside the active site at positions 69, 277 and 285 are important for {{the differences in the}} inhibition of these three BChE species.

40|$|Delayed {{neurotoxicity}} {{has been}} associated with organophosphorus poisoning for years. In order to study such condition in sheep, 11 animals were given either one or two high doses of <b>Haloxon.</b> Exposed sheep were observed daily and between 16 and 25 days after administration neurological signs as incoordination and ataxia were detected in six of them. Biopsies of tibial and laryngeal nerves were performed as soon as neurotoxicity was diagnosed, and after death fragments of selected nerves were collected together with CNS tissues for light and electron microscopy and teased fiber studies. Laryngeal, tibial and sciatic nerves showed the most pronouced changes, consisting chiefly of wallerian degeneration that was seen either as a single fiber or as a complete fascicle feature. Exams performed after death clearly showed regenerating fascicles with axonal sprouts growing within a Schwann cell old basal lamina, and some thinly myelinated axonal sprouts...|$|E
40|$|Organophosphate {{hydrolase}} (OPH, EC 3. 1. 8. 1) is {{a bacterial}} enzyme {{with a broad}} spectrum of potential substrates that include organophosphorus pesticides, herbicides, and chemical warfare agents. OPH has been expressed successfully in bacterial, fungal, and insect cell culture systems; however, none of these systems produces amounts of enzyme suitable for applications outside of the research laboratory. Therefore, a transgenic Zea mays L. (maize) system was developed to express OPH as an alternate to the current OPH expression systems. The bacterial gene encoding the OPH protein was optimized for transcriptional and translational expression in maize. The optimized gene was inserted into the maize genome under the control of embryo specific, endosperm specific, and constitutive plant promoters. Select transformants were analyzed for the expression of OPH. Expression was observed in the seeds of plants transformed with each of the three constructs with the highest expression observed with the embryo specific and constitutive promoter constructs. The highest OPH expressing lines of transgenic maize had expression levels higher than those reported for the E. coli expression system. OPH was purified from transgenic maize seed and analyzed for posttranslational modification and kinetic properties. OPH was observed to undergo a glycosylation event when expressed in maize that yielded at least two forms of OPH homogolous dimer. The glycosylated form of OPH bound tightly to the Concanavalin A sepharose and remained active after months of storage at room temperature. OPH activity was checked against a number of organophosphate herbicides. Enzymatic activity was observed against the herbicide Amiprophos-methyl and kinetic properties were measured. Enzymatic activity was also tested against the organophosphate <b>Haloxon.</b> Transgenic maize callus, leaf, and seed tissue could be screened for the presence of the optimized opd gene by enzymatic activity. Comparison of the growth of transgenic and control callus on media containing organophosphates showed that the transgenic callus was resistant to the herbicidal effects of <b>haloxon.</b> Transgenic plants expressing OPH were also resistant to the herbicide bensulide when compared to control plants. This indicates that OPH {{can be used as a}} screenable marker in plant systems and may be a potential scorable marker system as well...|$|E
