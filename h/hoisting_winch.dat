50|$|The patent Stülcken derrick is {{used for}} very heavy cargo. It stems from the German {{shipyard}} HC Stülcken & Sohn which has been taken over later by neighboring yard Blohm & Voss. This derrick can handle up to 300 tonnes. The Stülcken can be made ready in few minutes, dramatically faster than a traditional heavy derrick, doesn't require lots of space and is operated by four winches. Between two v-shaped, unstayed Samson-posts is the Stülcken secured. This {{makes it possible to}} let the derrick swing through the posts to reach another hatch. For each post is a <b>hoisting</b> <b>winch,</b> a span winch and a lever that is run by one man only. Bearings, swivels, sheaves and the gooseneck can be unattended for up to four years and create only a friction of about 2%. The span tackles are independent and the halyard is endless. With the revolving suspension heads on the posts it takes ten minutes to swing all the way through. In the double-pendulum block type, half of the cargo tackle can be anchored {{to the base of the}} boom. In order to double the hook speed, the halyard passes through the purchases since one end is secured which reduces the SWL to its half. Typical dimensions of a 275 tonne Stülcken are: 25.5 m length, 0.97 m diameter, 1.5 m to 3.4 m diameter of posts, 18 m apart the posts (upper end) and 8.4 m apart the posts (lower end). The hook of a full-loaded 275 tonne Stülcken can move 2.3 m per minute. If only one purchase is secured and the derrick is loaded with 137 tonnes the hook gains velocity to 4.6 m per min. Even more speed can be gained when the winch ratios are reduced to 100 tonnes (triple speed) and 68 tonnes (quadruple speed). Detaching the union table the double-pendulum block type of Stülcken is able to swing through which allows the lower blocks to swing freely to each side of the boom. In this way the derrick reaches a vertical position. A bullrope easily pulls the derrick to the other side until the weight of the cargo tips the derrick over. The span tackles now have the weight on the other side. The union table is fixed again and the derrick can start its work on the other side. There are also Stülcken with single-pendulum blocks. At this type the cargo hook is detached and the lower and upper cargo block are hauled into the center of the Stülcken. To tip the derrick over the gravity is here used again. A derrick helps pump oil in most offshore rigs.|$|E

40|$|Offshore crane {{operation}} {{is a complex}} task that demands the operator to control {{the position of the}} load, predict vessel motion and compensate for load sway, all at the same time. In this thesis an anti-sway, boom tip positioning and a wave following system is presented which purpose is to facilitate not automate the crane operation. Introducing such systems the operator has an extra set of tools to reduce risk of cargo damage and personnel injuries during operation. This is done by suppressing the sway angles and positioning the boom tip to a desired position with the anti-sway and boom tip positioning system, and {{be able to make the}} hook follow the heave motion of the vessel by using the wave following system. This thesis contains modeling, visualization, simulation and control of a rotary crane with spherical pendulum. Also models for a trolley with pendant load, vessel motion, and angular deflection of the wire and a wind model is presented. Lagrangian describes the dynamics of the crane models and the equation of motion is derived with Euler-Lagrange equations. The effect of measurement noise in the sensor signals has been reduced through the implementation of an adaptive Kalman-filter. Parameter estimation has been used to find unknown model parameters such as damping, frequency and bias in vessel heave motion model. Several suggestions of sensors to measure the swing angles of the <b>hoist</b> <b>winch</b> wire is presented. The 3 D visualization is developed using the V-Realm 3 D editor included in Simulink 3 D Animation toolbox. Results of the closed loop system shows that it is possible to control the load swing angles and boom tip position and still let the crane operator have the superior control of the crane. In case of stability it can be seen that since all friction terms is neglected in the mathematical model there is no dissipation of energy in the pendulum dynamics, meaning that the anti-sway controller causes any observed damping in the sway dynamics. </p...|$|R

50|$|The Magnicon, {{developed}} by Macfarlane's in Scotland, {{is similar to}} the Metadyne, but whereas the latter has a two-pole armature winding, the Magnicon has a four-pole lap winding, and is sometimes referred to a Metadyne with a short-pitched armature winding. They have been supplied to operate <b>hoists</b> and <b>winches</b> on ships. The stator of a Magnicon has four polar projections, spaced at 90 degrees, and one pair of them is excited. The pair of brushes which are on the same axis as the excited poles are short-circuited, resulting in a large current. The magnetomotive force (MMF) of this current acts on the non-excited poles, creating a working flux (Φ) and the output voltage. As with a full-pitch Metadyne, the armature reaction of the output current is 90 degrees out of phase, and therefore opposes the original excitation. Advantages over the normal Metadyne are that the number of exciting and compensating coils is halved to two each per cycle, and the shorter pitch of the coils results in less overhang at the ends of the windings. However, the design creates idle currents in the armature, which result in losses, and on larger machines, where interpoles are required, each interpole must be fitted with two coils, one for each of the brush circuits. Tustin argues that there is little advantage of the Magnicon over the Metadyne for smaller machines, and for larger machines, which require interpoles to be fitted, insufficient analysis has been carried out to make a judgement.|$|R
5000|$|A typical {{alternating}} current furnace {{is powered by}} a three-phase electrical supply and therefore has three electrodes. Electrodes are round in section, and typically in segments with threaded couplings, so that as the electrodes wear, new segments can be added. The arc forms between the charged material and the electrode, the charge is heated both by current passing through the charge and by the radiant energy evolved by the arc. The electric arc temperature reaches around 3000 °C (5000 °F), thus causing the lower sections of the electrodes glow incandescently when in operation. The electrodes are automatically raised and lowered by a positioning system, which may use either electric <b>winch</b> <b>hoists</b> or hydraulic cylinders. The regulating system maintains approximately constant current and power input during the melting of the charge, even though scrap may move under the electrodes as it melts. The mast arms holding the electrodes can either carry heavy busbars (which may be hollow water-cooled copper pipes carrying current to the electrode clamps) or be [...] "hot arms", where the whole arm carries the current, increasing efficiency. Hot arms can be made from copper-clad steel or aluminium. Large water-cooled cables connect the bus tubes or arms with the transformer located adjacent to the furnace. The transformer is installed in a vault and is water-cooled.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} association of neurodegenerative diseases and electric occupations and evaluates electric shocks and magnetic fields exposures. First, we conducted a meta-analysis of occupational electromagnetic fields (MF) and neurodegenerative diseases (NDD) to systematically explore methodological differences between studies. Second, we developed an electric shocks job exposure matrix (JEM) to characterize occupations exposed to electric shocks. Finally, we examined the association between occupational electric shocks, MF and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) mortality. We conducted a meta-analysis of epidemiologic studies on occupational MF exposure and NDD. We found weak associations of occupational MF exposures with both AD and MND, but not with Parkinson's disease, dementia, and multiple sclerosis. Risk of developing MND was associated with electric occupations, while AD risk was associated with estimated MF levels. Nonetheless, there is extensive result variation related to aspects of study design, with dissimilarity in this variation across diseases. Our results do not support MF as the explanation for the observed electric occupation and MND association. Misclassification of disease, particularly for AD, and imprecise exposure assessment affected most studies. To evaluate a consistent association between jobs in "electric" occupations and ALS, we developed a comprehensive JEM that includes electric shocks and MF. Electric shocks were based on two data sources along with expert judgment. Main occupational groups experiencing the electric shocks were precision production, craft and repair occupations. Specific jobs with high electric shock exposure were electrical apprentices, mechanic and repairer helpers, <b>hoist</b> and <b>winch</b> operators and electrical power installers. Examples of job titles with low electric-shock exposures were administrative support occupations, data-key entry operators, and waiters and waitresses. The relationship between occupational electric shocks, MF and ALS was investigated using cases identified in 1991 - 1999 U. S. mortality data. For each ALS death, 10 sex-, age-, year- and region-matched controls were selected. We linked the usual occupation reported on the death certificate to a JEM with electric shocks and MF. Increased odds ratios were observed for ALS among those in electric occupations (OR= 1. 23, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 04, 1. 47). For electric shocks, ALS mortality odds ratios were 0. 73 (95 % CI: 0. 67, 0. 79) for high exposure and 0. 90 (95 % CI: 0. 84, 0. 97) for medium exposure compared to low exposure. For MF, ALS mortality odds ratios were 1. 09 (95 % CI: 1. 00, 1. 19) for high exposure and 1. 09 (95 % CI: 0. 96, 1. 23) for medium exposure as compared to low. However, ALS mortality increased only in electric occupations with medium and low electric shocks exposures. Current results support an association between electric occupations and ALS, but provide no evidence that this association is explained by occupational exposure to electric shocks or MF...|$|R
