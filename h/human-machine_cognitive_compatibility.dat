40|$|Incompatibility between {{different}} types of road user {{is a problem that}} previous research has shown to be resistant to a range of interventions. Cars and motorcycles are particularly prone to this. Insight is provided in this paper by a naturalistic method using concurrent verbal protocols and an automatic, highly reliable semantic network creation tool. The method shows how the same road situation is interpreted differently by car drivers and motorcyclists in ways congruent with wider accident rates. Analysis of the structure and content of the semantic networks reveals a greater degree of <b>cognitive</b> <b>compatibility</b> on faster roads such as motorways, but evidence of more critical incompatibilities on country roads and junctions. Both of these road types are implicated in helping to activate cognitive schema which in turn generate stereotypical behaviors unfavourable to the anticipation of motorcyclists by car drivers.

40|$|Methods for {{handling}} uncertainty {{should be evaluated}} {{in terms of their}} <b>cognitive</b> <b>compatibility</b> with real-world decision makers. Bayesian models of uncertainty demand precise up-front assessments of all problem elements and discourage the dynamic evolution of problem understanding. They handle missing or conflicting data by mathematical aggregation, while realworld decision makers regard gaps in knowledge and conflicting evidence as problems to be solved. Finally, they produce as output a statistical average rather than a coherent picture of the situation. Another approach to decision making, based on pattern-matching, does not address the ways in which situation pictures are evaluated and modified. A third approach, however, called the Recognition / Metacognition model, treats decision making under uncertainty as a problem-solving process that starts with the results of recognition, verifies them, and improves them where necessary. Critiquing strategies identify problems of incompleteness, conflict, and unreliability in situation models, and lead to correcting steps that retrieve or collect additional information or adopt assumptions.

40|$|Many {{efforts have}} been made to exploit the {{properties}} of graphical notations to support argument construction and communication. In the context of design rationale capture, we are interested in graphical argumentation structures as cognitive tools to support individual and collaborative design in real time. This context of use requires a detailed understanding of how a new representational structure integrates into the cognitive and discursive flow of design, that is, whether it provides supportive or intrusive structure. This paper presents a use-oriented analysis of a graphical argumentation notation (QOC). Through a series of empirical studies, we show that it provides most support when elaborating poorly understood design spaces, but is a distraction when evaluating well constrained design spaces. This is explained in terms of the <b>cognitive</b> <b>compatibility</b> between argumentative reasoning and the demands of different modes of designing. We then provide an account based the collaborative affordances of QOC in group design meetings, and extend this to discuss the evolution of QOC argumentation from short term working memory to long term group memory...|$|R

Metacognition {{is seen as}} a control process that governs the action of more elemental cognitive skills. Given the centrality of this notion, it is important that metacognition should be examined in detail.

The whole development of computer-aided instruction, artificial intelligence, and special environments for instruction will unquestionably have profound effects on education, but its more enduring and important effect may well be increasing the understanding of cognition and learning.

Starting from this, the research {{described in this}} paper aims at finding and exploiting some TRIZ tools in interaction design field of practice. TRIZ theory offers well defined and structured methods and tools, and allows generation of generic guidelines for innovative design of a huge variety of products. Interaction design focuses on studying and developing a correct interaction between users and products, {{in order to maximize}} <b>cognitive</b> <b>compatibility.</b> Real goal of this research is developing a new design method where systematic approach to innovation of TRIZ compensates for some lacks of the user centered interaction design process. Starting from similarities and differences between tools currently used in these two domains, the research considers the TRIZ thirty-nine features, the forty inventive principles, and the contradiction matrix. These elements are adapted to the requirements of the interaction design field of practice, obeying to classic usability rules. These new elements contribute to the definition and development of a new design framework named interaction design guidelines - IDGL. The effectiveness of these elements has started to be tested in a case study focused on the interaction design of a new DVD recorder...|$|R

40|$|An {{attempt is}} {{currently}} being made to widely introduce industrial robots to Small-Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Since the enterprises usually employ too small number of robot units to afford specialized departments for robot maintenance, they must be provided with inexpensive and immediate support remotely. This paper evaluates whether the support can be provided by means of Cognitive Info-communication – communication in which human cognitive capabilities are extended irrespectively of geographical distances. The evaluations are given with an aid of experimental system that consists of local and remote rooms, which are physically separated – a six-degree-of-freedom NACHI SH 133 - 03 industrial robot is situated in the local room, while the operator, who supervises the robot by means of audio-visual <b>Cognitive</b> <b>Human-Machine</b> Interface, is situated in the remote room. The results of simple experiments show that Cognitive Info-communication is not only efficient mean to provide the support remotely, but is probably also a powerful tool to enhance interaction with any data-rich environment that require good conceptual understanding of system's state and careful attention management. Furthermore, the paper discusses data presentation and reduction methods for data-rich environments, as well as introduces the concepts of Naturally Acquired Data and <b>Cognitive</b> <b>Human-Machine</b> Interfaces...|$|R

40|$|The {{language}} modelling {{approach to}} information retrieval {{can also be}} used to compute query models. A query model can be envisaged as an expansion of an initial query. The more prominent query models in the literature have a probabilistic basis, that is, for each term w in the vocabulary, the probability of w, given the query Q,, is computed. This paper introduces an alternative, nonprobabilistic approach to query modelling whereby the strength of information flow is computed between the query Q and the term w. Information flow is a reflection of how strongly w is informationally contained within the query Q. In other words, the basis of the query model generation is information inference. The information flow model is based on Hyperspace Analogue to Language (HAL) vector representations, which reflects the lexical cooccurrence information of terms. Research from cognitive science has demonstrated the <b>cognitive</b> <b>compatibility</b> of HAL representations with human processing, and therefore HAL vectors would thus seem to be a potentially useful basis for inferring query expansion terms. Query models computed from TREC queries by HAL-based information flow are compared experimentally with two probabilistic query language models. Experimental results are provided showing the HAL-based information flow model be superior to query models computed via Markov chains, and seems to be as effective as a probabilistically motivated relevance model.

Considerations such as <b>cognitive</b> <b>compatibility</b> and usability of equipment and system design are becoming issues of increasing importance, as society becomes more reliant on information technology and automation. That engineers contribute to human error in these systems through latent design error and poor management decision-making is well documented. Therefore, the role of engineers can be considered integral to positive outcomes in workplace safety. This research offers an opportunity to understand why engineering design work may be contributing to human error on part of the operator, and offers hope toward a future when engineers will embrace safe design principles. This cross sectional study examines the relationship between professional engineering education and ergonomics. This research specifically addresses the attitudes of engineers to the inclusion of ergonomic principles in engineering practice and in undergraduate engineering curriculum.

The intensity of their attitude was more positive if they had some previous exposure to ergonomic training. At present few engineering faculties systematically include ergonomic principles in their design courses. The most encouraging finding was the overwhelming support for the inclusion of ergonomic principles in undergradute curriculum. The finding was complimented by current literature suggesting a changing pradigm, one that would facilitate and embrace these concepts, encouraging promotion of sustainable engineering design well into the future...|$|R

Within the European Project HUMAN, founded by the EC (2008 - 2011) a <b>cognitive</b> <b>human–machine</b> model of a pilot crew is developed. Such interactive models that account for the cognitive aspects of human information processing, claim supporting the development and design of new systems by error detections in an early design phase. This paper discusses the validation aspects of these complex human-machine models, focusing on eye movement analyses. Therefore a high-fidelity human-in-the-loop simulation was accomplished, integrating an Advanced-HMI/FMS with the capability for 4 D-trajectory gate-to-gate negotiations via datalink.

40|$|Large-Scale Multimedia Retrieval(LSMR) is {{the task}} to fast analyze {{a large amount of}} {{multimedia}} data like images or videos and accurately find the ones relevant to a certain semantic meaning. Although LSMR has been investigated {{for more than two decades}} in the fields of multimedia processing and computer vision, a more interdisciplinary approach is necessary to develop an LSMR system that is really meaningful for humans. To this end, this paper aims to stimulate attention to the LSMR problem from diverse research fields. By explaining basic terminologies in LSMR, we first survey several representative methods in chronological order. This reveals that due to prioritizing the generality and scalability for large-scale data, recent methods interpret semantic meanings with a completely different mechanism from humans, though such humanlike mechanisms were used in classical heuristic-based methods. Based on this, we discuss human-machine cooperation, which incorporates knowledge about human interpretation into LSMR without sacrificing the generality and scalability. In particular, we present three approaches to <b>human-machine</b> cooperation (<b>cognitive,</b> ontological, and adaptive), which are attributed to cognitive science, ontology engineering, and metacognition, respectively.

Therefore, if gender segregation relates to children's preferences to play with others who share their interests or interactive styles, simply expecting same-sex children to share interests may also affect their motivation to affiliate with same-sex playmates. The challenge of an integrative perspective is all the more important because gender segregation is a particularly promising topic for integrating and synthesizing multiple approaches to gender development...|$|R

40|$|Computer {{vision is}} {{becoming}} an integral part in human-machine interfaces as research increasingly aims at a seamless and natural interaction between a user and an application system. Gesture recognition, context awareness, and grounding concepts in the commonly perceived environment {{as well as in}} the interaction history are key abilities of such systems. Simultaneously, recent computer vision research has indicated that integrated systems which are embedded in the world and interact with their environment seem a prerequisite for solving more general vision tasks. Cognitive computer vision systems which enable the generation of knowledge on the basis of perception, reasoning, and extension of prior models are a major step towards this goal. For these, the integration, interaction and organization of memory becomes a key issue in system design. In this article we will present a computational framework for integrated vision systems that is centered around an active memory component.

40|$|Manual {{work is the}} key {{source of}} skill and {{ingenuity}} in industrial manufacturing. At the same time, {{it is the most}} expensive resource factor. Often machines can replace humans for more effective manufacturing because machines outperform humans in terms of strength, precision and endurance. Humans, however, perform better than machines when flexibility and intelligence is required. Flexible Manufacturing Systems are capable of manufacturing wide variety of products with low volume size and minimal lead time. These manufacturing cells are usually equipped with high level computer based control and include highly flexible industrial robots also. Robots can partially resolve contradiction of flexibility and intelligence due to their more humanlike structure and programmability. To a large extent, robots have already relieved workers of many of the tedious, hard and unhealthy parts of industrial work. But the universal application of robots in small-batch highly customized production is hindered by the time consuming robot programming. This thesis shows efficient methods and processes for teaching and optimizing complex robot tasks by introducing cognitive robot programming, flexible robotics, and middleware. Intelligent user interfaces combining information from several sensors in the manufacturing system will provide the operator with direct knowledge {{on the state of the}} manufacturing operation. Thus, the operator will be able to determine the system state quicker. Sensory system calculates and proposes the optimal process settings. The key element is the new <b>cognitive</b> <b>human-machine</b> communication channels helping the operator to comprehend the information from the sensory systems. Novel middleware technology is facilitated for integration of elements from different system platforms into a coherent robot system and scaling it for different hardware complexity levels.

40|$|This {{paper has}} {{examined}} the requirements of HF specification and certification within advanced or complex aircrew systems. It suggests reasons for current inadequacies {{in the use of}} HF in the design process, giving some examples in support, and suggesting an avenue towards the improvement of the HF certification process. The importance of human cognition to the operation and performance of advanced aircrew systems has been stressed. Many of the shortfalls of advanced aircrew systems must be attributed to over automated designs that show little consideration on either the mental limits or the cognitive capabilities of the human system component. Traditional approaches to system design and HF certification are set within an over physicalistic foundation. Also, traditionally it was assumed that physicalistic system functions could be attributed to either the human or the machine on a one to one basis. Moreover, any problems associated with the parallel needs, or promoting human understanding alongside system operation and direction, were generally equated in reality by the natural flexibility and adaptability of human skills. The consideration of the human component of a complex system is seen as being primarily based on manifestations of human behavior to the almost total exclusion of any appreciation of unobservable human mental and cognitive processes. The argument of this paper is that the considered functionality of any complex human-machine system must contain functions that are purely human and purely <b>cognitive.</b> <b>Human-machine</b> system reliability ultimately depends on human reliability and dependability and, therefore, on the form and frequency of cognitive processes that have to be conducted to support system performance. The greater the demand placed by an advanced aircraft system on the human component's basic knowledge processes or cognition, rather than on skill, the more insiduous the effects the human may have on that system. This paper discusses one example of an attempt to devise an improved method of specificaiton and certification with relation to the advanced aircrew system, that of the RN Merlin helicopter. The method is realized to have limitations in practice, these mainly associated with the late production of the system specification in relation to the system development process. The need for a careful appreciation of the capabilities and support needs of human cognition within the design process of a complex man machine system has been argued, especially with relation to the concept of system functionality. Unlike the physicalistic Fitts list, a new classification of system functionality is proposed, namely: (1) equipment - system equipment related; (2) cognitive - human cognition related; and (3) associated - necessary combinatin of equipment and cognitive. This paper has not proposed a method for a fuller consideration of cognition within systems design, but has suggested the need for such a method and indicated an avenue towards its development. Finally, the HF certification of advanced aircrew systems is seen as only being possible in a qualified sense until the important functions of human cognition are considered within the system design process.
