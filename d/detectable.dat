5|$|Subclinical {{hypothyroidism}} is a milder form of hypothyroidism {{characterized by}} an elevated serum TSH level, but with a normal serum free thyroxine level. This milder form of hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by Hashimoto's thyroiditis. In adults it is diagnosed when TSH levels are greater than 5 mIU/L and less than 10mIU/L. The presentation of subclinical hypothyroidism is variable and classic {{signs and symptoms of}} hypothyroidism may not be observed. Of people with subclinical hypothyroidism, a proportion will develop overt hypothyroidism each year. In those with <b>detectable</b> antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPO), this occurs in 4.3%, while in those with no <b>detectable</b> antibodies, this occurs in 2.6%. Those with subclinical hypothyroidism and <b>detectable</b> anti-TPO antibodies who do not require treatment should have repeat thyroid function tests more frequently (e.g. yearly) compared with those who do not have antibodies.|$|E
5|$|The United States Air Force {{monitored}} airborne contamination through nasal swabs of onsite personnel. Of the 9,837 nasal swabs taken, 335 samples had <b>detectable</b> {{levels of}} alpha particle activity, although none was above acceptable levels. Urinalysis was also performed {{but none of}} the 756 samples displayed any <b>detectable</b> level of plutonium.|$|E
5|$|Where the {{pressure}} is 33±5 millibars, the atmosphere is clear (probably hydrogen) and its Rayleigh effect is <b>detectable.</b> At that pressure the temperature is 2200±260 K.|$|E
5|$|Amphetamine is {{frequently}} measured in urine or blood {{as part of}} a drug test for sports, employment, poisoning diagnostics, and forensics. Techniques such as immunoassay, which is {{the most common form of}} amphetamine test, may cross-react with a number of sympathomimetic drugs. Chromatographic methods specific for amphetamine are employed to prevent false positive results. Chiral separation techniques may be employed to help distinguish the source of the drug, whether prescription amphetamine, prescription amphetamine prodrugs, (e.g., selegiline), over-the-counter drug products that contain levomethamphetamine, or illicitly obtained substituted amphetamines. Several prescription drugs produce amphetamine as a metabolite, including benzphetamine, clobenzorex, famprofazone, fenproporex, lisdexamfetamine, mesocarb, methamphetamine, prenylamine, and selegiline, among others. These compounds may produce positive results for amphetamine on drug tests. Amphetamine is generally only <b>detectable</b> by a standard drug test for approximately 24hours, although a high dose may be <b>detectable</b> for days.|$|E
5|$|Another related {{spurious}} generation {{method is}} the slight modulation {{due to the}} GRR outlined above. The amplitude of these spurs is low for large N and their frequency is generally too low to be <b>detectable</b> but they may cause issues for some applications.|$|E
5|$|Apparently, by late 1968, no X-rays {{had been}} {{detected}} from the Andromeda Galaxy. A balloon flight on October 20, 1970, set an upper limit for <b>detectable</b> hard X-rays from the Andromeda Galaxy.|$|E
5|$|At room temperature, {{fluorine}} is a gas of diatomic molecules, {{pale yellow}} when pure (sometimes described as yellow-green). It has a characteristic pungent odor <b>detectable</b> at 20ppb. Fluorine condenses into {{a bright yellow}} liquid at −188°C (−306°F), a transition temperature {{similar to those of}} oxygen and nitrogen.|$|E
5|$|Idiopathic {{intracranial}} hypertension (IIH) {{is a condition}} characterized by increased intracranial pressure (pressure around the brain) without a <b>detectable</b> cause. The main symptoms are headache, vision problems, ringing in the ears with the heartbeat, and shoulder pain. Complications may include vision loss.|$|E
5|$|In this context, the League of Nations {{was also}} the {{institution}} where the first international debate on terrorism took place following the 1934 assassination of King Alexander I of Yugoslavia in Marseille, showing its conspiratorial features, {{many of which are}} <b>detectable</b> in the discourse of terrorism among states after 9/11.|$|E
5|$|Initial asymmetries {{have also}} been {{confirmed}} in TypeIa supernovae through observation. This result may mean that the initial luminosity {{of this type of}} supernova depends on the viewing angle. However, the expansion becomes more symmetrical with the passage of time. Early asymmetries are <b>detectable</b> by measuring the polarization of the emitted light.|$|E
5|$|On December 1, 2011, it was {{announced}} that Voyager 1 had detected the first Lyman-alpha radiation originating from the Milky Way galaxy. Lyman-alpha radiation had previously been detected from other galaxies, but because of interference from the Sun, the radiation from the Milky Way was not <b>detectable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rotational {{transitions}} {{of various}} isotopic forms {{of carbon monoxide}} (for example, CO, CO, and CO) are <b>detectable</b> in the submillimeter wavelength range, and {{are used in the}} study of newly forming stars in molecular clouds.|$|E
5|$|Since 2008, {{consensus}} American and British opinion {{has been}} that in general people with TSH under 10mIU/l do not require treatment. American guidelines recommend that treatment should be considered if the TSH is elevated but below 10mIU/l in people with symptoms of hypothyroidism, <b>detectable</b> antibodies against thyroid peroxidase, a {{history of heart disease}} or are at an increased risk for heart disease.|$|E
5|$|There {{could conceivably}} be other planets {{in the system}} that do not transit the star, but they would only be <b>detectable</b> by the effects of their gravity on {{the motion of the}} visible planets (much as how Neptune was discovered).|$|E
5|$|Traumatic {{brain injury}} {{is defined as}} damage to the brain {{resulting}} from external mechanical force, such as rapid acceleration or deceleration, impact, blast waves, or penetration by a projectile. Brain function is temporarily or permanently impaired and structural damage {{may or may not}} be <b>detectable</b> with current technology.|$|E
5|$|Unlike audible {{signatures}}, tornadic signatures {{have been}} isolated; {{due to the}} long distance propagation of low-frequency sound, efforts are ongoing to develop tornado prediction and detection devices with additional value in understanding tornado morphology, dynamics, and creation. Tornadoes also produce a <b>detectable</b> seismic signature, and research continues on isolating it and understanding the process.|$|E
5|$|A {{black hole}} is {{a region of}} spacetime exhibiting such strong {{gravitational}} effects that nothing—not even particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from inside it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Although the event horizon has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, no locally <b>detectable</b> features appear to be observed. In many ways a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine is <b>detectable</b> with {{measuring}} devices in concentrations {{as low as}} 0.2 parts per million (ppm), and by smell at 3 ppm. Coughing and vomiting may occur at 30 ppm and lung damage at 60ppm. About 1000ppm can be fatal after a few deep breaths of the gas. The IDLH (immediately dangerous to life and health) concentration is 10 ppm. Breathing lower concentrations can aggravate the respiratory system and exposure to the gas can irritate the eyes. The toxicity of chlorine comes from its oxidizing power. When chlorine is inhaled at concentrations greater than 30ppm, it reacts with water and cellular fluid, producing hydrochloric acid (HCl) and hypochlorous acid (HClO).|$|E
5|$|Electrons are {{important}} in cathode ray tubes, which have been extensively used as display devices in laboratory instruments, computer monitors and television sets. In a photomultiplier tube, every photon striking the photocathode initiates an avalanche of electrons that produces a <b>detectable</b> current pulse. Vacuum tubes use the flow of electrons to manipulate electrical signals, and they {{played a critical role}} in the development of electronics technology. However, they have been largely supplanted by solid-state devices such as the transistor.|$|E
5|$|FLCN {{mutations}} are {{detected by}} sequencing in 88% of probands with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome. This means {{that some people}} with the clinical diagnosis have mutations that are not <b>detectable</b> by current technology, or that mutations in another currently unknown gene could be responsible for a minority of cases. In addition, amplifications and deletions in exonic regions are also tested. Genetic testing can be useful to confirm the clinical diagnosis of {{and to provide a}} means of determining other at-risk individuals in a family even if they have not yet developed BHD symptoms.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, Hendrik van de Hulst {{predicted}} that microwave radiation with wavelength of 21 cm would be <b>detectable</b> from interstellar atomic hydrogen gas; and in 1951 it was observed. This radiation is {{not affected by}} dust absorption, and so its Doppler shift {{can be used to}} map the motion of the gas in our galaxy. These observations led to the hypothesis of a rotating bar structure in the center of our galaxy. With improved radio telescopes, hydrogen gas could also be traced in other galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Individual photons can be {{detected}} by several methods. The classic photomultiplier tube exploits the photoelectric effect: a photon of sufficient energy strikes a metal plate and knocks free an electron, initiating an ever-amplifying avalanche of electrons. Semiconductor charge-coupled device chips use a similar effect: an incident photon generates a charge on a microscopic capacitor that can {{be detected}}. Other detectors such as Geiger counters use the ability of photons to ionize gas molecules contained in the device, causing a <b>detectable</b> change of conductivity of the gas.|$|E
5|$|Infrared {{observation}} {{has shown}} {{there are no}} bodies of three or more Jupiter masses in this system, out to at least a distance of 500AU from the host star. Planets with similar masses and temperatures as Jupiter should be <b>detectable</b> by Spitzer at distances beyond 80AU, but none has been discovered in this range. Planets more than 150% as massive as Jupiter can be ruled out at the inner edge of the debris disk at 30–35AU.|$|E
5|$|Mars is a {{terrestrial}} planet {{that consists of}} minerals containing silicon and oxygen, metals, and other elements that typically make up rock. The surface of Mars is primarily composed of tholeiitic basalt, although parts are more silica-rich than typical basalt and may be similar to andesitic rocks on Earth or silica glass. Regions of low albedo suggest concentrations of plagioclase feldspar, with northern low albedo regions displaying higher than normal concentrations of sheet silicates and high-silicon glass. Parts of the southern highlands include <b>detectable</b> amounts of high-calcium pyroxenes. Localized concentrations of hematite and olivine have been found. Much of the surface is deeply covered by finely grained iron(III) oxide dust.|$|E
5|$|Seyfert {{galaxies are}} one of the two largest groups of active galaxies, along with quasars. They have quasar-like nuclei (very luminous, distant and bright sources of {{electromagnetic}} radiation) with very high surface brightnesses but unlike quasars, their host galaxies are clearly <b>detectable.</b> Seyfert galaxies account for about 10% of all galaxies. Seen in visible light, most Seyfert galaxies look like normal spiral galaxies, but when studied under other wavelengths, the luminosity of their cores is equivalent to the luminosity of whole galaxies the size of the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|The Wilson's disease gene (ATP7B) {{has been}} mapped to {{chromosome}} 13 (13q14.3) and is expressed {{primarily in the}} liver, kidney, and placenta. The gene codes for a P-type (cation transport enzyme) ATPase that transports copper into bile and incorporates it into ceruloplasmin. Mutations can be detected in 90% of cases. Most (60%) are homozygous for ATP7B mutations (two abnormal copies), and 30% have only one abnormal copy. Ten percent have no <b>detectable</b> mutation.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} in {{a newborn baby}} are much larger as a {{proportion}} of the body size than in an adult. For example, at age three months the glands are four {{times the size of the}} kidneys. The size of the glands decreases relatively after birth, mainly because of shrinkage of the cortex. The cortex, which almost completely disappears by age 1, develops again from age 4–5. The glands weigh about 1 g at birth and develop to an adult weight of about 4 grams each. In a fetus the glands are first <b>detectable</b> after the sixth week of development.|$|E
5|$|The {{lighthouse}} had two lights; {{the lower}} a fixed white {{light and the}} upper a quick flashing white light, showing every 60 seconds. However, this quick revolution gave the impression it was a fixed light with no flashes <b>detectable.</b> This {{may have contributed to}} the grounding, at Cefn Sidan, of the La Jeune Emma, bound from Martinique to Cherbourg in 1828. 13 of the 19 on board drowned, including Adeline Coquelin, the 12-year-old niece of Napoleon Bonaparte's divorced wife Joséphine de Beauharnais.|$|E
5|$|The {{pronunciation}} of vowels varies a {{great deal}} between dialects {{and is one of}} the most <b>detectable</b> aspects of a speaker's accent. The table below lists the vowel phonemes in Received Pronunciation (RP) and General American (GA), with examples of words in which they occur from lexical sets compiled by linguists. The vowels are represented with symbols from the International Phonetic Alphabet; those given for RP are standard in British dictionaries and other publications.|$|E
5|$|Thrombophilia (sometimes {{hypercoagulability}} or a prothrombotic state) is an abnormality {{of blood}} coagulation {{that increases the}} risk of thrombosis (blood clots in blood vessels). Such abnormalities can be identified in 50% of people who have an episode of thrombosis (such as deep vein thrombosis in the leg) that was not provoked by other causes. A significant proportion of the population has a <b>detectable</b> abnormality, but most of these only develop thrombosis in the presence of an additional risk factor.|$|E
5|$|Tycho {{and others}} had {{observed}} the supernova of 1572. Ottavio Brenzoni's letter of 15 January 1605 to Galileo brought the 1572 supernova and the less bright nova of 1601 to Galileo's notice. Galileo observed and discussed Kepler's supernova in 1604. Since these new stars displayed no <b>detectable</b> diurnal parallax, Galileo concluded that they were distant stars, and, therefore, disproved the Aristotelian belief in the immutability of the heavens.|$|E
25|$|Researchers in 2004 {{found no}} <b>detectable</b> {{difference}} in audio quality between DVD-A and SACD (and subsequent research found no <b>detectable</b> difference in audio quality between SACD and CD).|$|E
25|$|Thorium and uranium (and their daughters) {{primarily}} undergo alpha and beta decay, and aren't easily <b>detectable.</b> However, many {{of their}} daughter products are strong gamma emitters. Thorium-232 is <b>detectable</b> via a 239keV peak from lead-212, 511, 583 and 2614keV from thallium-208, and 911 and 969keV from actinium-228. Uranium-238 manifests as 609, 1120, and 1764keV peaks of bismuth-214 (cf. the same peak for atmospheric radon). Potassium-40 is <b>detectable</b> directly via its 1461keV gamma peak.|$|E
25|$|Mifepristone {{showed no}} <b>detectable</b> anti-HIV {{activity}} in clinical trials.|$|E
25|$|The {{influence}} of Zedler on further publishing projects {{is no longer}} <b>detectable.</b>|$|E
25|$|ITP is an {{autoimmune}} disease with antibodies <b>detectable</b> against several platelet surface antigens.|$|E
