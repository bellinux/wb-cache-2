5|$|George Smith {{established}} a second <b>distillery</b> during 1849, named the Cairngorm-Delnabo <b>Distillery</b> but by 1855 or 1856, both distilleries were running at full capacity, and {{were unable to}} meet rising demand. The operation of two separate sites was also proving difficult and expensive, so plans were formed {{around the same time}} to build a new, larger <b>distillery</b> further down the hill at Minmore. Construction of this new <b>distillery</b> was underway when the old Upper Drumin <b>distillery</b> was destroyed by fire during 1858. Construction of the new Minmore <b>distillery</b> was sped up and salvageable equipment from the Upper Drumin <b>distillery</b> was transferred to the new Mimmore <b>distillery.</b> The Delnabo <b>distillery</b> was closed {{at the same time and}} the best parts of the equipment were also transferred to the Minmore plant. Production commenced at the new plant during 1859 and it was around the same time the legal entity of George & J.G. Smith, Ltd. was formed.|$|E
5|$|The last <b>distillery</b> in Pittsburgh, Joseph S. Finch's <b>distillery,</b> {{located at}} South Second and McKean streets, {{closed in the}} 1920s. In 2012, Wigle Whiskey opened, {{becoming}} the first since the closure of Finch's <b>distillery.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>distillery</b> draws {{water from}} Josie's Well and other springs a short {{distance}} from the <b>distillery.</b> The malt comes from Crisp Maltings, Portgordon. Glenlivet's stills are lantern shaped with long, narrow necks, all of which helps to produce a light tasting spirit.|$|E

5000|$|John <b>Distilleries</b> {{acquired}} Chitali <b>Distilleries</b> Limited (CDL) in August 2008 for [...] It was John <b>Distilleries</b> first acquisition outside South India, {{and enabled}} it to produce rectified spirit and extra neutral alcohol. The company was merged with JDL on 1 October 2010. Chitali <b>Distilleries</b> had been fully {{owned by the}} Government of Maharashtra and is located in Shrirampur in Ahmadnagar district.|$|R

5|$|The {{main product}} {{range from the}} <b>distillery</b> is The Glenlivet range of single malt scotch whisky, but whisky from the <b>distillery</b> is also used in the {{production}} of Pernod Ricard's other brands, including Chivas Regal and Royal Salute whisky brands.|$|E
5|$|Glenlivet is {{categorised}} as a Speyside <b>distillery.</b> As of 2016, The Glenlivet range {{consists of}} 13 whiskies.|$|E
5|$|The <b>distillery</b> {{remained}} open {{throughout the}} Great Depression, an event which affected many other distilleries; it wasn't until the Second World War that the <b>distillery</b> was mothballed {{for the first}} time, by Government decree. In the aftermath of World War Two, Britain was heavily indebted and needed to export large quantities of goods to earn foreign revenue (mainly United States dollars). Distilling was an ideal industry with whisky much in demand overseas. Distilling restrictions were rapidly lifted and output from the <b>distillery</b> was at pre-war levels by 1947, despite ongoing barley, fuel, and manpower limitations. Bread rationing was retained until 1948 {{in order to ensure}} supplies of grain for the distilleries.|$|E
5000|$|Campbeltown, once home to over 30 <b>distilleries,</b> {{currently}} has only three <b>distilleries</b> operating: Glen Scotia, Glengyle, and Springbank.|$|R

5|$|Whilst playing {{part-time}} for <b>Distillery</b> he {{also worked}} at the Harland and Wolff shipbuilding company. Though the maximum wage in England discouraged many of Belfast's top players from leaving their hometown, Dougan was determined {{to leave for the}} English Football League at the earliest opportunity, particularly so following the death of his mother in June 1955. He began to attract scouts from England after helping <b>Distillery</b> beat Glentoran 1–0 in the second replay of the 1956 final of the Irish Cup at Windsor Park. He played mostly at half-back in the 1956–57 season as <b>Distillery</b> finished sixth in the Irish League and ended up as runners-up in the Ulster Cup, City Cup, and County Antrim Shield.|$|E
5|$|At {{the height}} of the second World War in 1941, the Oval – {{including}} terraces, offices, kits and club records – was destroyed in a bombing raid on the nearby Harland & Wolff Shipyard. Glentoran approached <b>Distillery</b> to play at Grosvenor Park, which they did until the Oval was rebuilt with help from other clubs, most notably Cliftonville. During this time, Glentoran considered resigning from senior football to become a junior club, but after borrowing kits from <b>Distillery</b> and Crusaders they continued to compete at Grosvenor until 1949. Out of 14 league games at Grosvenor Park however, they were only victorious over Linfield on one occasion.|$|E
5|$|Illicit distilleries were commonplace {{throughout}} the Speyside area from medieval times but were largely made redundant {{with the passing}} of the Excise Act in 1823. It was under this legislation that legal distilleries could be formed, subject to holding a license. Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon, was allegedly instrumental in the passing of this legislation. Although there is no historical record of his involvement in the issue, his tenant, George Smith, who was operating an illicit <b>distillery</b> at the time, became the first person in Glenlivet to apply for and receive a license to legally produce spirit. This would prove to be an unpopular decision; every other distiller was operating illegally at the time and hoping the new Excise Act would be repealed, something which would not happen if some distillers accepted the new law. Threats were made against George Smith, so George Gordon provided Smith with two pistols to be used to ensure both his own safety and that of the <b>distillery.</b> In 1824, The Glenlivet <b>distillery</b> was established at Upper Drumin by George and his youngest son John Gordon Smith.|$|E
5000|$|According the Alcoholic Beverage Federation of Ireland, as of November 2016, {{at least}} {{thirteen}} new <b>distilleries</b> {{have been granted}} planning permission in Ireland, with many other projects {{in various stages of}} planning.

5|$|In 2005 Diageo {{acquired}} the Bushmills Irish whiskey brand and <b>distillery</b> from Pernod Ricard for €295 million. In 2008 Diageo acquired a 50 per cent {{stake in the}} Ketel One brand for US$900 million.|$|E
5|$|Lochranza in {{the north}} has the ferry {{connection}} to Claonaig on the Kintyre peninsula. Other points of interest include Lochranza Castle and the Isle of Arran <b>Distillery,</b> which opened in 1995 {{and has become a}} busy tourist attraction.|$|E
5|$|The <b>distillery</b> has 7 wash stills {{each with}} a {{capacity}} of 15,000 litres and 7 spirit stills with a capacity of 10,000 litres. The spirit is then matured in oak casks.|$|E
50|$|In 1972, the Glenlivet and Glen Grant <b>Distilleries</b> Ltd amalgamated {{with the}} {{blending}} concerns of Hill, Thomson and Co.Ltd and Longmorn <b>Distilleries</b> Ltd to become The Glenlivet Distillers Ltd. The original family {{interest in the}} <b>distilleries</b> was maintained, with two substantial outside shareholders: Courage Ltd, the brewing concern and Suntory Ltd, the Japanese distilling company.|$|R

5|$|After Harrison {{returned}} to the United States from Colombia, he settled on his farm in North Bend, Ohio, his adopted home state, living in relative retirement after nearly four decades of government service. Having accumulated no substantial wealth during his lifetime, he subsisted on his savings, a small pension, and the income produced by his farm. Harrison cultivated corn and established a <b>distillery</b> to produce whiskey. After a brief time in the liquor business, he became disturbed by the effects of alcohol on its consumers, and closed the <b>distillery.</b> In a later address to the Hamilton County Agricultural Board in 1831, Harrison said he had sinned in making whiskey, and hoped that others would learn from his mistake and stop the production of liquors.|$|E
5|$|Between levels, the Kid {{visits the}} Bastion, where the player can use fragments—the game's form of currency—that they have accrued to buy {{materials}} and upgrade weapons. With each core the player collects, they can add {{one of six}} structures to the Bastion, such as a shrine, an armory, or a <b>distillery,</b> and each shard allows the player to expand a structure. Each structure serves a different purpose; for example, the <b>distillery</b> lets the player select upgrades, and the shrine allows the player to choose idols of the gods to invoke, causing the enemies to become stronger and giving the player increased experience points and currency. Experience points are {{used to determine the}} Kid's ability level; higher values give the player more health and increase the number of upgrades they can select.|$|E
5|$|Depending {{upon the}} size and {{economic}} well-being of the farm, there might also be a feast hall (oppstue), a house for the retired farmers (føderådstue), farm hands' dormitory (drengstue), carriage house (vognskjul), and even <b>distillery</b> (brenneskur). Smaller, poorer farms might combine barns and dwelling houses, have simpler storage areas, and use the facilities of other farms for activities {{they could not afford}} to build houses for.|$|E
50|$|In Japan a {{different}} model is generally adopted. Typically {{the industry is}} vertically integrated, meaning whisky companies own both the <b>distilleries</b> and the brands of blended whiskies. These companies are often reluctant to trade with their competitors. So a blended whisky in Japan will generally only contain malt whisky from the <b>distilleries</b> owned by that same company (sometimes supplemented with malts imported from Scottish <b>distilleries).</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>distilleries</b> above mentioned, there are <b>distilleries</b> within the town of Bombay at which spirit is extracted from the juice of date, brab, and cocoanut trees growing in the island...|$|R
50|$|In 1966, {{with the}} Irish <b>distilleries</b> still facing an {{uncertain}} future, CDC merged {{with two of}} the other remaining Dublin <b>distilleries,</b> John Jameson & Son. and John Powers & Son., to form Irish Distillers.|$|R
5|$|In 1766, {{he started}} {{switching}} Mount Vernon's primary cash crop away from tobacco to wheat, a crop {{that could be}} processed and then sold in various forms in the colonies, and further diversified operations to include flour milling, fishing, horse breeding, hog production, spinning, and weaving, and (in the 1790s) he erected a <b>distillery</b> for whiskey production which yielded more than 1,000 gallons a month.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration {{determined}} that absinthe was legal, {{though it had}} been understood to be illegal for about 80 years. Portland <b>distillery</b> Integrity Spirits responded by releasing the second American-made absinthe, which was in high demand immediately upon its release.|$|E
5|$|The government's first witness, U.S. Attorneys' Office clerk Gordon Morgan {{testified that}} Glasser had {{suggested}} that Sidney S. Eckstone be appointed foreperson of a grand jury that returned only eight out of twenty indictments and that Glasser and Eckstone had conferred frequently. Another prosecution witness, illegal <b>distillery</b> landlord William F. Workman, testified that Capone-affiliated Louis Schiavone had posted approximately $1,000,000 in bail bonds.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>distilleries</b> in Scotland are not {{owned by}} Scots. The Japanese {{beverage}} company Suntory owns Morrison-Bowmore, while other international companies, such as LVMH & Pernod-Ricard (France), and Diageo (England), own {{the majority of}} <b>distilleries.</b> The largest distiller to remain under Scottish ownership is William Grant & Sons, owned by the Grant family, with headquarters in Motherwell, Scotland. Other <b>distilleries</b> owned by Scottish companies/families are Glenfarclas, Kilchoman, and Bunnahabhain.|$|R
50|$|Pontarlier {{was famous}} for the {{production}} of absinthe until its ban in 1915. The <b>distilleries</b> switched over to producing pastis. With the ban partially lifted in the 1990s, Pontarlier <b>distilleries</b> are once again producing absinthe.|$|R
50|$|In {{the spring}} of 2005, MacLeod {{was part of the}} three-month-long Glenfiddich <b>Distilleries</b> artist-in-residence program. During the residency, MacLeod {{documented}} her experience through photography, sculpture, and drawing. She recorded specific aspects of the area surrounding the <b>distilleries,</b> and notably- the deterioration of buildings on the land that Glenfiddich <b>Distilleries</b> inhabits. MacLeod was the first Canadian artist to be invited to this residency, and was one of seven international artists attending the residency. The collection of work created through the Glenfiddich <b>Distilleries</b> artist in residence program was shown at the Contemporary Art Gallery in 2006, in an exhibition titled Where I Have Lived and What I Have Lived For.|$|R
