40|$|Energetic components, such as RDX or HMX of {{very small}} {{particle}} sizes are of considerable importance for Less Sensitive High Explosives (IHE) and LOVA - Propellants, Especially particle sizes of 3 smaller than 10 microns and spherical shape. are of interest. Furthermore, {{it is important}} to be able to use RDX of this small particle size in a desensitized form for safe processing in a batch mixer or in a twin-screw extruder. Common methods for obtaining energetics- of such small particle size are <b>fluid</b> <b>energy</b> <b>mill</b> grinding or re-crystallization. However, it is very~ difficult to desensitize RDX by coating their surface with additives. Often an inhomogeneous product is obtained that also tends to agglomerate. In order to obtain RDX of the required small particle size, a spray drying process was developed at ICT. In this process, solutions of RDX containing various desensitizing additives are spray dried. In this way, a desensitized product is obtained, which shows a particle size distribu tion that can be adjusted between 3 and 10 pm. At the same time, large particles can be avoided completely. This method will be treated, as well as different products obtained by this method using various additives. The decrease in impact and friction sensitivities will be commented on. This spray drying process can be scaled up to production size. Using this safe processing technology, desensitized products can be systematically manufactured at reasonable costs...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The Twincer {{disposable}} {{dry powder}} inhaler {{was developed for}} the administration of high drug doses in cystic fibrosis and tuberculosis therapy. Its excellent performance on several antibiotics has challenged testing of other high dose drugs for pulmonary administration with the Twincer. The example of the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA) is given in this abstract. Methods: CsA (Chemos GmbH) was micronised using an 50 AS <b>fluid</b> <b>energy</b> <b>mill</b> (Alpine Hosokawa) into a powder with volume median diameter of 1. 64 /m from 0. 5 bar RODOS dispersion (Sympatec). Doses of 2. 5 to 15 mg of pure drug were tested at 4 kPa and for the 5 mg dose, the pressure drop was varied between 2 and 6 kPa. Size distributions in the aerosol were measured with laser diffraction technique. Results: Volume median diameters (VMD's) and fine particle fractions < 5 /m (FPF's) in the delivered aerosols from the Twincer varied from 2. 42 /m and 93. 4 % (2. 5 mg dose) to 3. 12 /m and 70. 2 % (15 mg dose) at 4 kPa. For the 5 mg dose, VMD and FPF varied from 3. 09 /mand 76. 7 %(2 kPa) to 2. 21 /m and 90. 0 % (6 kPa). Inhaler retention (all doses; all pressure drops) was < 10 %. FPF's are given as percent of the real dose. Conclusion: The data show that the Twincer is highly efficient for the administration of various high dose drugs.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{altering}} {{and changing the}} properties of the energetic materials by coating has been studied extensively by several scientific groups. According to the desired application different coating techniques have been developed and applied to achieve satisfactory results. Among the already developed and used techniques are: ALD (atomic layer deposition), CVD (chemical vapor deposition), FEM (<b>fluid</b> <b>energy</b> <b>mill),</b> crystallization, aerosol-spray pyrolysis, Ziegler-Natta reaction and others. In TNO Defence, Security and Safety in The Netherlands, a facility for coating of energetic materials has been constructed. We propose a new plasma coating technique for energetic materials where a new type of Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) is used with sufficiently improved production rates. Our facility aims to treat powders in the low micron range and at ambient temperature. The range of materials that can be treated is not restricted by their temperature sensitivity. Our facility is based on circulating solid-gas fluidized bed. The coating capacity is approximately 40 g of energetic powder material per minute. This is possible because of the re-circulation nature of the fluidized bed. The precursors are introduced in the system in gas phase. The energy efficiency of the coating process is determined by the input plasma power, flow rate and molecular weight of the reaction gas and the treatment time. The research field, in which the facility is primarily used, is the reduction of sensitivity of several MIC’s (metastable intermolecular composites) and possibilities for prolonged shelf-life. This paper describes the design of the new fluidized bed plasma reactor as well as the research program on reduction of energetic materials sensitivity and manufacturing of novel energetic materials...|$|E

40|$|The Scandinavian {{mechanical}} {{pulp and paper}} industry has been facing great challenges during the past decades, mainly because of declining demand for newsprint, and higher prices on raw material and energy. One way of increasing proﬁtability is to produce more value-added products besides the production of pulp and paper. In this study, integration potentials of three possible future biomass gasiﬁcation-based <b>energy</b> <b>mills</b> with an existing thermo-{{mechanical pulp}} (TMP) mill, co-located with a sawmill, have been evaluated. The product gas was utilized for electricity production in a gas turbine, for production of methanol or for production of FischereTropsch (FT) liquids.

However, since there is little excess heat from the TMP mill at the required level to be utilized for biomass drying, for example, heat integration is typically one way.

We addressed {{the hypothesis that}} progressive right atrial dilatation contributes to inefficient right heart flow dynamics. Methods: Modified atriopulmonary connections were performed on explanted isolated sheep heart preparations with various degrees of surgically induced right atrial dilatation (right atrial volumes 6 to 55 cm 3). Flow models were perfused in an in vitro flow loop {{with the use of}} a blood analog <b>fluid.</b> A <b>fluid</b> <b>energy</b> balance was performed for six flow rates (1. 0 to 6. 0 L/min) at each degree of right atrial dilatation, and the rate of total <b>fluid</b> <b>energy</b> loss was calculated and expressed as a function of right atrial volume and flow rate. Effective pressure drop and fluid resistance across the right atrial chamber were also determined for each flow condition. Results: The rate of <b>fluid</b> <b>energy</b> loss increased with increasing right atrial dilatation and flow rate for all conditions studied (p < 0. 001). Over the range of right atrial volumes and flow rates examined, the average increase in the rate of energy loss was 3. 8 - and 117 -fold, respectively. Calculated fluid resistance through the right atrium also increased with increasing right atrial volume and flow rate (p < 0. 001), exhibiting an average increase of 3. 2 - and 3. 3 -fold respectively.
