500|$|Vampire Weekend {{concentrated}} {{their efforts}} on giving each recording [...] "warmth", feeling that modern digital recordings lacked the sound quality of older records. In {{an attempt to make}} the tracks sound less harsh, the band and their recording engineers used a spectrum analyzer, Sonnox SuprEsser and heavily automated EQs to edit out harsher, colder frequencies and soften the mix. Vampire Weekend painstakingly listened to the record several separate times using technology from standard commercial iPod <b>earbuds</b> to professional equipment to ensure the record sounded nice regardless of equipment the listener owned. Desiring to [...] "check the relative warmth levels", the engineers would [...] "go in and perform surgery and automate EQs" [...] {{in order to make the}} mixes listenable. The band felt the finished product was something of a third chapter and a continuation of material explored in their previous two efforts. [...] "We thought these three albums should look like they belong together on a bookshelf", said Batmanglij. [...] "We realized that there are things connecting the songs across three albums, like an invisible hand was guiding us. It does feel like we've been able to create three distinct worlds for each album, and yet have them be interconnected." ...|$|E

2500|$|Headphones {{are made}} {{in a range of}} {{different}} audio reproduction quality capabilities. [...] Headsets designed for telephone use typically cannot reproduce sound with the high fidelity of expensive units designed for music listening by audiophiles. [...] Headphones that use cables typically have either a 1/4 inch (6.35mm) or 1/8 inch (3.5mm) phone jack for plugging the headphones into the audio source. Some stereo <b>earbuds</b> are wireless, using Bluetooth connectivity to transmit the audio signal by radio waves from source devices like cellphones and digital players. [...] Due to the spread of wireless devices in recent years headphones are increasingly used by people in public places such as sidewalks, grocery stores, and public transit. [...] Headphones are also used by people in various professional contexts, such as audio engineers mixing sound for live concerts or sound recordings and DJs, who use headphones to cue up the next song they will play without the audience hearing, aircraft pilots and call center employees. The latter two types of employees use headphones with an integrated microphone.|$|E

In this updated version, an iPod, complete with signature white <b>earbuds,</b> was digitally added to the heroine. Keynote Attendees were given a poster showing the heroine with an iPod as a commemorative gift. And the ad has also been cited as the turning point for Super Bowl commercials, which had been important and popular before (especially with the Coca-Cola ad featuring Joe Greene from a years earlier) but after [...] "1984" [...] those ads became the most expensive, creative and influential advertising set for all television coverage.|$|E
2500|$|The third {{generation}} iPod Shuffle featured a polished steel attachment clip, adopting {{for the first}} time the polished steel finishing previously found only on the larger iPods, rather than the brushed aluminum used in the second-generation iPod Shuffle. It also no longer had volume or track controls on the device itself. Instead, the packaged iPod <b>earbuds</b> included a three-button device on the right earbud cord. This added the functions of changing between playlists, hearing the song title and artist of the track playing, as well as play/pause, track changes and volume control. It originally was not possible to change songs or volume with most third-party headphones, since they lacked these controls. However, since the device began playing music automatically when it was turned on, third-party headphones could still be used in [...] "autoplay" [...] mode (with no volume or playback controls), and after its release, some third-party headphones and headphone adapters began to include full support for the {{third generation}}. The official headphones contained a chip designed by Apple to control the device. DRM is not however present in the chip as there is no encryption used.|$|E

50|$|Smaller <b>earbud</b> type earpieces, which {{plugged into}} the user's ear canal, were first {{developed}} for hearing aids but became widely used with transistor radios, the first truly portable radios, which were developed around 1960. The most popular audio device in history, the transistor radio changed listening habits, allowing people to listen to radio anywhere. The <b>earbud</b> uses either a moving iron type driver or a piezoelectric crystal to produce sound. The 3.5 mm radio and phone connector, {{which is the most}} commonly used in portable application today, has been used at least since the Sony EFM-117J transistor radio which was released in 1964. It became very popular with its application on the Walkman in 1979.|$|R

2500|$|Headphones (or head-phones in {{the early}} days of {{telephony}} and radio) are a pair of small loudspeaker drivers that are designed to be worn on or around the head over a user's ears. [...] They are electroacoustic transducers, which convert an electrical signal to a corresponding sound. Headphones are designed to allow a single user to listen to an audio source privately, in contrast to a loudspeaker, which emits sound into the open air, for anyone nearby to hear. [...] Headphones are also known as earspeakers, earphones or, colloquially, cans. Circumaural and supra-aural headphones use a band over the top of the head to hold the speakers in place. [...] The other type, known as <b>earbuds</b> or earpieces consist of individual units that plug into the user's ear canal. [...] In the context of telecommunication, a headset is a combination of headphone and microphone. Headphones connect to a signal source such as an audio amplifier, radio, CD player, portable media player, mobile phone, video game console, or electronic musical instrument, either directly using a cord, or using wireless technology such as bluetooth or FM radio. [...] The first headphones were developed in the late 19th century for use by telephone operators, to keep their hands free. Initially the audio quality was mediocre and a step forward was the invention of high fidelity headphones.|$|E

40|$|Objectives/Hypothesis Sound {{pressure}} level delivered through personal listening devices (PLDs) and reaching the ear drum might {{be affected by}} body size and jaw movements. This study aimed to investigate whether jaw movement and/or smaller body mass index (BMI) resulted in decrease of sound {{pressure level}} within the ear canals of PLD users via an <b>earbud</b> earphone. Study Design Case series. Methods Forty-five normal-hearing subjects (16 males; mean age, 23. 3 years) participated in this study. A probe-microphone system {{was used to measure}} sound pressure level in the external ear canal with music delivered from a media player via an <b>earbud</b> earphone. Test materials consisted of two 20 -second excerpts from a heavy metal music piece. Subjects were instructed to adjust the volume of the media player to conform to three conditions for sound pressure measurement: comfortable, loud, and maximum. Measurements were then repeated while subjects mimicked chewing action under the same listening conditions. Results Sound pressure levels were significantly lower when measured with jaw movement than without jaw movement (P <. 05). Sound pressure levels monitored with/without jaw movement were generally lower in subjects with a BMI< 23 than those with a BMI ≥ 23 (P <. 05). Conclusions Jaw movement and low BMI (< 23) reduced the overall sound level of PLDs at the ear canal. Sound pressure levels detected in the external ear canal of our subjects using <b>earbud</b> earphones were significantly lower under conditions of jaw movement/BMI < 23. Our research invites further studies on a larger group of PLD users to correlate these variables with hearing threshold shifts over time. Level of Evidence 4. 5 page(s...|$|R
