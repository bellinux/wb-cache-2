5|$|In October 1987, {{encouraged}} by Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, McEwen {{announced he would}} challenge Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, a Democrat, in his 1988 bid for re-election, but McEwen found he lacked statewide support and would face a strong primary challenger in Cleveland mayor George V. Voinovich. He {{dropped out of the}} race in December. McEwen's name was <b>floated</b> <b>in</b> 1991 as a possible challenger in 1992 to Ohio's other senator, John Glenn, another Democrat, but McEwen did not enter the race.|$|E
5|$|The {{blood that}} spurts {{out of the}} Klingon's wounds was created using {{computer}} generated imagery; the animators {{had to make sure}} that the blood <b>floated</b> <b>in</b> a convincing manner while still looking interesting and not too gory. The effects artist looked at NASA footage of floating globules of water to inform the physics of the blood particles. Initially, the blood was to be colored green, but the filmmakers realized that McCoy had referred to Spock as green-blooded.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of species are surface feeders, obtaining food {{that has been}} pushed to the surface by other predators or currents, or have <b>floated</b> <b>in</b> death. Among the surface feeders some, principally the gadfly petrels, can obtain food by dipping from flight, {{while most of the}} rest feed while sitting on the water. These surface feeders are dependent on their prey being close to the surface, and for this reason procellariids are often found in association with other predators or oceanic convergences. Studies have shown strong associations between many different kinds of seabirds, including wedge-tailed shearwaters, and dolphins and tuna, which push shoaling fish up towards the surface.|$|E
5|$|Water clocks, or clepsydrae, were {{commonly}} used in Ancient Greece following their introduction by Plato, who also invented a water-based alarm clock. One account of Plato's alarm clock describes it as depending on the nightly overflow of a vessel containing lead balls, which <b>floated</b> <b>in</b> a columnar vat. The vat held a steadily increasing amount of water, supplied by a cistern. By morning, the vessel would have floated high enough to tip over, causing the lead balls to cascade onto a copper platter. The resultant clangor would then awaken Plato's students at the Academy. Another possibility is that it comprised two jars, connected by a siphon. Water emptied until it reached the siphon, which transported the water to the other jar. There, the rising water would force air through a whistle, sounding an alarm. The Greeks and Chaldeans regularly maintained timekeeping records as {{an essential part of}} their astronomical observations.|$|E

40|$|We {{establish}} {{a connection between}} capillary <b>floating</b> <b>in</b> neutral equilibrium and the billiard ball problem. This allows us to reduce the question of <b>floating</b> <b>in</b> neutral equilibrium at any orientation with a prescribed contact angle for infinite homogeneous cylinders {{to a question about}} billiard caustics for their orthogonal cross-sections. We solve the billiard problem. As an application, we characterize the possible contact angles and exhibit an infinite family of real analytic non-round cylinders that <b>float</b> <b>in</b> neutral equilibrium at any orientation with constant contact angles.

25|$|The Imperial Bank of Persia {{was finally}} {{established}} in 1889 {{on the basis}} of the 1872 concession to Baron Julius De Reuter from the Persian government (Reuter concession) which made it the state bank, with the exclusive right to issue notes and tax free status for sixty years.

25|$|A {{hypothesis}} that insect feeding may improve plant fitness was <b>floated</b> <b>in</b> the mid-1970s by Owen and Wiegert.

In a nitrogen poor environment, this could provide an advantage to an infested plant over a noninfested plant. However, this {{does not appear to}} be supported by the observational evidence.|$|E

25|$|North Melbourne {{is unique}} in its structure, because from 1986 to 2006 the club was privately owned and limited by shares. The club was <b>floated</b> <b>in</b> 1986 through a {{membership}} vote led by then chairman Bob Ansett. At the meeting, members were encouraged {{to buy into the}} club by purchasing shares. The float ended up raising over $3million and helped to keep the club solvent through the next decade.|$|E

Above it, the club's badge <b>floated</b> <b>in</b> the wind. The stadium currently houses the headquarters of the club's media, as well as an official store, club museum and trophy cabinet.|$|E

25|$|About 290 {{million years}} ago, in the Carboniferous period, an ice age engulfed {{the area as}} glaciers {{advanced}} from the polar region eroding and transporting rocks. These rocks were deposited as extensive moraines and glacial till, or they sank in the sea while the glacier <b>floated</b> <b>in</b> a layer of ice. When the glacial sediments were turned into stone they formed the rocks that now make up the Fitzroy Tillite Formation in the Falklands. Identical rocks are found in southern Africa.|$|E
25|$|The 1823 {{campaign}} in Western Greece {{was led by}} Mustafa Reshit Pasha and Omer Vrioni. During the summer the Souliot Markos Botsaris was shot dead at the Battle of Karpenisi {{in his attempt to}} stop the advance of the Ottomans; the announcement of his death in Europe generated a wave of sympathy for the Greek cause. The campaign ended after the Second Siege of Missolonghi in December 1823. In February 1824, the loan for Greece was <b>floated</b> <b>in</b> the City, attracting some £472, 000 pounds sterling, which was money that the Greeks badly needed.|$|E
25|$|The {{film was}} made for US$370,000, with one-third of the budget paying for Kinski's salary. It was filmed on {{location}} in the Peruvian rainforest, Machu Picchu (the stone steps of Huayna Picchu), and on the Amazon River tributaries of the Ucayali region. Aguirre was shot in five weeks, following nine months' worth of pre-production planning. The film was shot in chronological order, because Herzog believed the film crew's progress on the river directly mirrored that of the explorers' journey in the story. The director and his cast and crew <b>floated</b> <b>in</b> rafts down the Huallaga and Nanay rivers through the Urubamba Valley in Peru.|$|E
