50|$|In {{blood and}} bone marrow smears megakaryoblasts are usually {{medium-sized}} to large cells {{with a high}} nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio. Nuclear chromatin is dense and homogeneous. There is scanty, variable basophilic cytoplasm which may be vacuolated.

Megakaryoblasts lack myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and stain negatively with Sudan black B. They are alpha naphthyl butyrate esterase negative and manifest variable alpha naphthyl acetate esterase activity usually in scattered clumps or granules in the cytoplasm. PAS staining also varies from negative to focal or granular positivity, to strongly positive staining. A marrow aspirate is difficult to obtain in many cases because of variable degree of myelofibrosis.

50|$|This {{technique}} {{is used to}} study proteins expressed in cells using immunologic markers. In B-PLL patients there is strong expression of surface immunoglobulin - a membrane-bound form of an antibody, b-lymphocyte surface antigens CD19, CD20, CD22, CD79a and FMC7, and weak expression of CD5 and CD23.

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} the <b>immunophenotypes</b> of macular corneal dystrophy (MCD) in Indian patients and to correlate them with mutations in the carbohydrate 6 -sulfotransferase (CHST 6) gene. Methods: Sixty-four patients from 53 families with MCD {{that were previously}} screened for mutations in CHST 6 were included in an <b>immunophenotype</b> analysis. Antigenic keratan sulfate (AgKS) in serum as well as corneal tissue was evaluated in 31 families. Only cornea was evaluated in 11 families, and only serum was evaluated in 11 families. AgKS was detected in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded corneal sections by immunohistochemistry and in serum by ELISA using a monoclonal antibody against sulfated forms of KS in patients with MCD as well as normal controls. Results: Analysis of corneal and/or serum AgKS disclosed MCD type I (27 families), MCD type IA (5 families), and MCD type II (3 families) in the cases studied. An additional 10 families were either MCD type I or MCD type IA since only serum AgKS data were available. Seven families manifested atypical <b>immunophenotypes</b> since the corneal AgKS expression was either of MCD type I or MCD type IA, but serum AgKS levels ranged from 19 ng/ml to 388 ng/ml. More than one <b>immunophenotype</b> was detected amongst siblings in two families. Each <b>immunophenotype</b> was associated with mutational heterogeneity in CHST 6. Conclusions: MCD type I was the predominant <b>immunophenotype</b> in the Indian population studied followed by MCD type IA and then MCD type II.

40|$|Background Nodular {{lymphocyte}} predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL) usually presents {{in middle}} aged men and shows an indolent clinical behavior. However, up to 30 % {{of the patients}} present a secondary transformation into aggressive diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The aim {{of the present study}} was to characterize morphology and <b>immunophenotype</b> of this kind of DLBCL in detail and compare it with conventional DLBCL. Methods Morphology and <b>immunophenotype</b> of 33 cases of NLPHL with simultaneous or sequential transformation into DLBCL were investigated. These cases were compared with 41 de novo DLBCL in Finnish men. Results The majority of cases exhibited different <b>immunophenotypes</b> in the NLPHL and the DLBCL components. The <b>immunophenotype</b> of the DLBCL secondary to NLPHL was heterogeneous. However, BCL 6, EMA, CD 75 and J-chain were usually expressed in both components (≥ 73 % positive). Overall, the NLPHL component was more frequently positive for EMA, CD 75 and J-chain than the DLBCL component. In contrast, B cell markers, CD 10 and BCL 2, were more frequently expressed and were expressed at higher levels in the DLBCL component than in the NLPHL component. In the independent series of de novo DLBCL 4 cases could be identified with a growth pattern and <b>immunophenotype</b> that suggested that they had arisen secondarily from NLPHL. Conclusions The morphology and <b>immunophenotype</b> of DLBCL arisen from NLPHL is heterogeneous. Further characterization of the particular molecular features of this subgroup is warranted to be able to better identify these cases among conventional DLBCL. BioMed Central open acces...|$|R

It involves the labelling of white blood cells with antibodies directed against surface proteins on their membrane.

50|$|Since the '90s <b>immunophenotyping</b> (staining {{cells with}} {{antibodies}} conjugated with fluorochromes and detection with flow cytometer) became the preferred method in diagnostics of haematological malignancies.

Because {{there is a great}} progress in development of antibodies, fluorochromes and multicolor digital flow cytometres, it became a question of how to interpret cytometric data and how to achieve comparable results between facilities. Even though a consensus of recommendations and guidelines was established, standardization was only partial because there was no regard of different antibody clones, fluorochromes and their optimal combinations or of sample preparation.
