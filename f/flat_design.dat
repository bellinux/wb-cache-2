5|$|Gaudí complemented this organic {{vision of}} {{architecture}} {{with a unique}} spatial vision {{that allowed him to}} conceive his designs in three dimensions, unlike the <b>flat</b> <b>design</b> of traditional architecture. He used to say that he had acquired this spatial sense as a boy by looking at the drawings his father made of the boilers and stills he produced. Because of this spatial conception, Gaudí always preferred to work with casts and scale models or even improvise on-site as a work progressed. Reluctant to draw plans, only on rare occasions did he sketch his works—in fact, only when required by authorities.|$|E

25|$|A speed table (or {{flat top}} hump or raised {{pedestrian}} crossing) is {{designed as a}} long speed hump with a flat section in the middle. Speed tables are generally {{long enough for the}} entire wheelbase of a passenger car to rest on top. The long, <b>flat</b> <b>design</b> allows cars to pass without slowing as significantly as with speed humps or cushions. Because they slow cars less than similar devices, speed tables are often used on roads with typical residential speed limits.|$|E

25|$|Aluminum {{electrolytic}} capacitors form {{the bulk of}} the {{electrolytic capacitors}} used in electronics because of the large diversity of sizes and the inexpensive production. Tantalum electrolytic capacitors, usually used in the SMD version, have a higher specific capacitance than the aluminum electrolytic capacitors and are used in devices with limited space or <b>flat</b> <b>design</b> such as laptops. They are also used in military technology, mostly in axial style, hermetically sealed. Niobium electrolytic chip capacitors are a new development in the market and are intended as a replacement for tantalum electrolytic chip capacitors.|$|E
25|$|Screens {{made up of}} {{labyrinths}} {{of complicated}} joinery, consisting of multitudes of tiny balusters connecting hexagons, squares or other forms, with the flat surfaces constantly enriched with small carvings, are familiar to every one. In Cairo we also have examples in the mosque of Qous (12th century) of that finely arranged geometrical interlacing of curves with foliage terminations which distinguishes the Saracenic designer. Six panels in the Victoria and Albert Museum (13th century), {{and work on the}} tomb of the sultan Li Ghoury (16th century), show how deeply this form of decoration was ingrained in the Arab nature. Figure work and animals were sometimes introduced, in medieval fashion, as in the six panels just referred to, and at the hflpital du Moristan (13th century) and the mosque of El Nesfy Qeycoun (14th century). There is a magnificent panel on the door of Beyt-el-Emyr. This exquisite design is composed of vine leaves and, grapes of conventional treatment in low relief. The Arab designer was fond of breaking up his paneling in a way reminding one of a similar Jacobean custom. The main panel would be divided into a number of hexagonal, triangular or other shapes, and each small space filled in with conventional scroll work. Much of this simple <b>flat</b> <b>design</b> reminds one of that Byzantine method from which the Elizabethan carvers were inspired.|$|E
500|$|Numismatist David Bullowa, in {{his early}} work on commemoratives, stated, [...] "the design of this issue is pleasing... the obverse and reverse alike are sharply defined, {{interesting}} and not crowded". Art historian Cornelius Vermeule, in his work on U.S. coins and medals, wrote that the half dollar [...] "manages to combine most of the faults found in the better designs of the 1920's and 1930's." [...] After complaining about the <b>flat</b> <b>design</b> and {{the large amount of}} lettering on both sides, Vermeule critiqued, [...] "the bust of Moses Cleaveland {{can only be described as}} commonplace, and the view of the Great Lakes, bisected by a large compass, is nothing short of incomprehensible." [...] Nevertheless, Vermeule suggested that Putnam did the best she could to squeeze the required text onto a half dollar, and might have done better with fewer words to place.|$|E

5|$|Although <b>flat</b> <b>designs</b> {{have the}} benefit of simplicity, other designs such as {{inverted}} pyramids and cones can be significantly more effective. This is probably because the designs shield the condensing surfaces from unwanted heat radiated by the lower atmosphere, and, being symmetrical, they are not sensitive to wind direction.|$|R
50|$|The place {{demonstrates}} {{the three main}} types of purpose <b>designed</b> <b>flat</b> buildings being <b>designed</b> and constructed in Brisbane during the interwar period. These include the bachelor flat, the moderate rental blocks, and the more prestigious architect designed blocks. The Julius Street Flats also demonstrate the fashionable styles, including Old English, Spanish Mission or Mediterranean, favoured by architects {{of much of the}} more prestigious domestic housing in Brisbane during the interwar period. <b>Flats</b> <b>designed</b> in the modernist, Art Deco and Functionalist schools were much rarer. The place is also important as it includes Ardrossan, an important example of a flat/apartment building designed by prominent Brisbane architects Chambers and Ford.|$|R
2500|$|In 1991 Panasonic came on {{the market}} with its [...] "SP-Cap", called polymer {{aluminum}} electrolytic capacitors. These aluminum electrolytic capacitors with polymer electrolytes reached very low ESR values directly comparable to ceramic multilayer capacitors (MLCCs).

2500|$|Figure 4 {{illustrates}} the procedure. Comparing the top panel (α = 4) {{with the lower}} panel (α=0.5) shows lower values for α [...] increase the rate of response, but increase overshoot. The case α=2 (center panel) is the maximally <b>flat</b> <b>design</b> that shows no peaking in the Bode gain vs. frequency plot. That design has {{the rule of thumb}} built-in safety margin to deal with non-ideal realities like multiple poles (or zeros), nonlinearity (signal amplitude dependence) and manufacturing variations, any of which can lead to too much overshoot. The adjustment of the pole separation (that is, settingα) is the subject of frequency compensation, and one such method is pole splitting.|$|E
2500|$|Aluminum {{capacitors}} {{with liquid}} electrolytes based on borax or organic solvents {{have a large}} range of types and ratings. Capacitors with water-based electrolytes are often found in digital devices for mass production. Types with solid manganese dioxide electrolyte have served {{in the past as}} a [...] "tantalum replacement". Polymer aluminum electrolytic capacitors with solid conductive polymer electrolytes are becoming increasingly important, especially in devices with a <b>flat</b> <b>design,</b> such as tablet PCs and flat panel displays. Electrolytic capacitors with hybrid electrolytes are relatively new on the market. With their hybrid electrolyte system they combine the improved conductivity of the polymer with the advantage of liquid electrolytes for better self-healing property of the oxide layer, so that the capacitors have the advantages of both low ESR and low leakage current.|$|E

50|$|<b>Flat</b> <b>design</b> is {{primarily}} {{influenced by the}} International Typographic Style (also known as Swiss Style), Text User Interface, Modernism, and the styles emerging from Bauhaus.

5000|$|<b>Flat</b> <b>design</b> {{has been}} criticized for making user {{interfaces}} unintiuitive and less usable. By making all design elements (menus, buttons, links, etc.) flat, distinguishing what function an element serves may become more difficult, for example, determining whether an element is a button or an indicator. [...] Research has shown that <b>flat</b> <b>design</b> is more popular with young adults than older adults. Research also showed that, while young people seem faster at navigating flat designs, they also have trouble with understanding the user interface. [...] In 2013 Jakob Nielsen, Ph.D, an expert in user interface design and usability, dubbed <b>flat</b> <b>design</b> as a [...] "threat to tablet usability". Nielsen also proposed an alternative, namely a middle-ground between skeumorphism and <b>flat</b> <b>design.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Flat</b> <b>Design</b> was {{initially}} introduced by Microsoft {{with the name}} Metro Design and later on they used an alternative <b>Flat</b> <b>Design.</b> In 2002, Microsoft released Windows Media Center, and in 2006, the Zune MP3 player, both of which contained elements of <b>flat</b> <b>design.</b> The design of the Zune was clean and simple, {{with a focus on}} large lowercase typography, silhouette-style logos, and monochromatic font colors. Microsoft continued this style of design with the 2010 release of Windows Phone 7, which built on the <b>flat</b> <b>design</b> elements introduced with the Zune. The design was dominated by large and bright shapes accompanied by sans-serif typography, flat images, and a menu with a grid-like pattern. Because {{of the success of the}} Windows Phone 7 design, Microsoft released the Windows 8 operating system based on Metro, with the same <b>flat</b> <b>design</b> elements. Use of bold colours, simple typography, long shadow and ghost buttons are some of the crucial elements of flat web design. Again, the design is dominated by grid shapes, sharp edges, bright colours, and clean typography. Microsoft has since moved its current products to the Metro design language, including the Xbox 360, Microsoft Office, and the Microsoft website.|$|E
