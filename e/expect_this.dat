5|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} studies on climate change and bees examined the species, B. Disinguendus and B. sylvarum between 2000 and 2006 in the UK. The study showed that as the climate of western Europe warmed, these two bee species experienced range declines and narrower climatic niches pushing them to the fringes of their environments. Geographically and climatically we <b>expect</b> <b>this,</b> as climate change continues bees will move and abandon areas of drought and migrate towards the fringes, as this has already been seen within desert oases. Europe has done significant work in tracking bee colony changes within regions. Additional longitudinal surveillance must be conducted in other regions of the globe among a wider array bee species to build the body of research on the impact of climate change on bees.|$|E

25|$|Two-slit {{diffraction}} is {{a famous}} {{example of the}} strange behaviors that waves regularly display, that are not intuitively associated with particles. The overlapping waves from the two slits {{cancel each other out}} in some locations, and reinforce each other in other locations, causing a complex pattern to emerge. Intuitively, one would not <b>expect</b> <b>this</b> pattern from firing a single particle at the slits, because the particle should pass through one slit or the other, not a complex overlap of both.|$|E
25|$|On September 15, 2012, the NTSB {{requested}} the grounding of certain 787s due to GE engine failures; GE believed the production problem had been fixed by that time. In March 2014, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries informed Boeing {{of a new}} problem that {{was caused by a}} change in manufacturing processes. Employees did not fill gaps with shims to connect wing rib aluminum shear ties to the carbon composite wing panels; the tightened fasteners, without shims, cause excessive stress that creates hairline cracks in the wings, which could enlarge and cause further damage. Forty-two aircraft awaiting delivery were affected, and each one required 1–2 weeks to inspect and repair. However, Boeing did not <b>expect</b> <b>this</b> problem to affect the overall delivery schedule, even if some airplanes were delivered late.|$|E

25|$|The donor is {{expected}} to take a good breath and pass his/her demand valve (or mouthpiece {{in the case of a}} twin-hose regulator) to the recipient, who {{is expected}} to take two good breaths and pass it back. In reality the recipient will often take more than two breaths, and the donor should <b>expect</b> <b>this</b> and relax to minimize metabolic rate. The donor should retain a good grip on the demand valve throughout the buddy breathing process, as a panicked recipient may fail to give it back. A reasonably reliable way of keeping control of the demand valve is to grasp the hose firmly in the fist where it connects to the demand valve. This provides good control but allows the recipient to use the purge button if needed.|$|E
25|$|The {{characteristic}} of Edgeworth is to connect an identifiable strain of formal realism, both philosophical and rhetorical, and therefore display an objective interest {{in human nature}} {{and the way it}} manifests itself in social custom. One would <b>expect</b> <b>this</b> from Edgeworth, an author whose didacticism often has struck modern readers as either gendered liability, technical regression, or familial obligation. Critics have responded to Edgeworth's eccentricities by attributing them to something more deep-seated, temperamental, and psychological. In their various, often insightful representation, Edgeworth's fondness for the real, the strange, and the pedagogically useful verges on the relentless, the obsessive, and the instinctive. There is an alternative literary answer to explain Edgeworth's cultural roots and ideological aims which shifts focus away from Edgeworth's familial, psychological, and cultural predicaments to the formal paradigms by which her work has been judged. Rather than locating Edgeworth's early romances of real life exclusively within the traditions of eighteenth-century children's literature or domestic realism, they can be read primarily as responses to late eighteenth-century debates over the relation between history and romance, because the genre attempts to mediate between the two differentiating itself from other kinds of factual fiction. Edgeworth's romances of real life operate in the same discursive field but do not attempt to traverse between self-denied antinomies. In fact, they usually make the opposite claim.|$|E

[...] Sutherland said that [...] "The end result {{may not be enough}} to convince America it's missing out, but <b>expect</b> <b>this</b> album to bring the already-converted back onboard in droves." [...] Dave Karger from Entertainment Weekly gave it a B+ rating. Karger felt that, although the album [...] "contains fewer knockout potential hits than past efforts", it does feature [...] "the two strongest soul-flecked tracks of Williams' career", in [...] "You Know Me" [...] and [...] "Won't Do That", and that the singer [...] "simply sounds fantastic with a horn section".|$|E
500|$|One {{day after}} his father {{died of a heart}} attack or stroke, Favre decided to play in a December 22, 2003, Monday Night Football game against the Oakland Raiders. The Packers {{traveled}} to Oakland where Favre passed for four touchdowns in the first half and 399 total yards in a 41–7 victory over the Raiders on international television (even receiving applause from [...] "Raider Nation"). He completed 73.3% of his passes and finished the game with a passer rating of 154.9 with having recorded a perfect 158.3 rating with four touchdowns and over 250 yards passing by halftime (a feat accomplished by only four other passers in NFL history). Afterwards, Favre said, [...] "I knew that my dad would have wanted me to play. I love him so much and I love this game. It's meant a great deal to me, to my dad, to my family, and I didn't <b>expect</b> <b>this</b> kind of performance. But I know he was watching tonight." [...] After the game, he went to his father's funeral in Pass Christian, Mississippi. Favre won an ESPY Award for his Monday Night Football performance.|$|E
500|$|We the Kings {{planned to}} release one single per month but they grew impatient. They decided to {{dedicate}} {{two months of}} studio time to writing a new album. On September 26, 2013, We the Kings set up a crowd-funding campaign on the website IndieGoGo to record a new album with a target goal of $35,000. The band offered 12 perks to fans who could receive rewards for their contribution such as a [...] "Thank You" [...] in the album's credits section, or spending {{a day in the}} studio. While the campaign ran for 30 days, the goal was met within 24 hours. The group received $67,000 in a matter of two days and eventually received at total of $149,483 from 2,309 contributors. Initially, the group thought that this figure was an error. After being contacted, IndieGoGo confirmed the amount was correct. Clark commented that their fans [...] "can <b>expect</b> <b>this</b> to be the best album we've ever made, because there are no strings attached.

500|$|In January 2012, it was {{reported}} that Ne-Yo, along with his label imprint Compound Entertainment, had moved from Def Jam Recordings to Motown Records. He was also appointed Senior Vice President of A of Motown, where he would serve [...] "...as a producer and mentor to the label's artists, as well as seeking out and signing new talent to the label." [...] Ne-Yo was slated to release his fifth studio album, R.E.D. (as in [...] "Realizing Every Dream"), on September 18, 2012. The album was initially titled The Cracks in Mr. Perfect. The album's first official single, [...] "Lazy Love", was released on June 12, 2012 and peaked at number forty-two on the US Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs chart. [...] "Let Me Love You (Until You Learn to Love Yourself)", co-written by Australian singer-songwriter Sia, was released as the second single on July 31, 2012. Because of Kevin McCall's new album and the song Ne-Yo will be in, [...] "Love Time", was not yet released because he and his friend Chris Brown will make an appearance on Ne-Yo's R.E.D. album in the song called [...] "What I Do", which they all will be involved in writing the beat says Ne-Yo, who was interviewed by TMZ in New York. [...] "I <b>expect</b> <b>this</b> to be a banger in clubs for the slow songs and to get Ne-Yo his first top 10 song in years," [...] said Chris Brown, after a celebrity basketball game with Ne-Yo, Kevin Hart, and other celebrities in the month of July.|$|E
500|$|A second {{consequence}} of collapsing wheat prices was the threat they posed to the Alberta Wheat Pool (AWP). [...] Falling {{prices and the}} attendant tightened credit conditions led the Pool, along with its counterparts in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, to seek help from its provincial government in 1930. [...] Brownlee guaranteed loans to the Pool, but told the legislature {{that he did not}} <b>expect</b> <b>this</b> guarantee to prove necessary, since the large portions of the 1929 crop already sold at higher prices would provide sufficient cushioning unless wheat prices fell [...] "to a level never reached on Canadian markets". [...] In October 1930, with the Pool receiving a price for its wheat well below the $1.00 per bushel that it guaranteed its farmers, the banks refused to loan more money unless the Pool appointed to its Central Selling Agency (CSA) a general manager acceptable to the banks. [...] Brownlee and Premiers John Bracken of Manitoba and James Thomas Milton Anderson of Saskatchewan met in Ottawa with acting Prime Minister Sir George Perley, seeking direct federal aid to the Pools. [...] The premiers' pleas rejected, CSA President Alexander James McPhail offered the banks the names of two possible general managers. [...] The first was John McFarland, former president of the Alberta Pacific Grain Company. [...] The second was Brownlee. [...] The banks chose McFarland. [...] Brownlee too imposed conditions on the AWP as a condition of provincial assistance: he wanted the provincial government to be consulted on all AWP managerial decisions and given the right to veto capital expenditures, and he required it to increase its sales commission from three quarters of a cent per bushel to one cent. [...] While these conditions met with resistance from farmer leaders who believed that they would transform the AWP from a farmers' organization to a grain company like any other, Brownlee was supported by UFA President Henry Wise Wood, the AWP was reliant on provincial support, and the conditions were accepted.|$|E
500|$|Roger Catlin {{from the}} Hartford Courant {{said that the}} {{passages}} from the book were [...] "too dirty to quote here, even the funny ones". The Daily Beast said that [...] "the book is neither groundbreaking (save that it features a major star) nor particularly sexy [...] Sex is convincing only when it's playful, as when she appears nude in a Miami pizzeria, chewing a slice while a baffled customer looks on. Elsewhere, she's simply undressed {{with no place to}} go". Richard Harrington from The Washington Post gave the book a mixed review by saying: [...] "Is Sex shocking? not really. Mostly because it's Madonna, and somehow we've come to <b>expect</b> <b>this</b> from her. Is Sex boring? surprisingly, yes". During her review of the book, British author Zoë Heller from The Independent wrote that it was [...] "the women who once saw Madonna as a witty feminist role model who have been most alarmist about her latest pornographic incarnation" [...] and that [...] "previously, they say, Madonna played with traditional images of feminine sexuality in a subversive, 'empowering' way. But now, with sado-masochism and rape fantasies, she has gone too far." [...] Calvin Tomkins, author and art critic for The New Yorker, wrote that [...] "unfortunately, the book is going to be mistaken for pornography". Vanity Fair deemed it [...] "the dirtiest coffee table book to ever be published". Caryn James from The New York Times was negative in her review stating that [...] "There is plenty here to offend the meek (whips and chains), the self-righteous (gay men and lesbians), not to mention the tasteful (a tacky and cluttered art design)". Vicki Goldberg from the same newspaper was also dismissive of the photography of the book saying that [...] "Unfortunately, not many of the images are very good photographically.
