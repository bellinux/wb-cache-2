An electro-scan valves system was used to get the simultaneous pressures distribution on the models.

The results shown, the mean wind pressures on the low rise-to-span ratio models will lower then the higher ratio ones. But the fluctuating and peak pressures on the roof, especially at the corners, will be increased. About the shielding effect, it will reduce the surface pressures and the structural loadings. But {{in the cases of}} small <b>gap</b> <b>between</b> <b>buildings,</b> the peak pressure will be increased at side wall and roof corners of buildings.

An automatic system {{for the analysis of}} traffi c profi les, a Gaussian model for the determination of traffi c emissions (ADMS-Urban) and a computational fl uid dynamics model (ANSYS Fluent) to simulate the dispersion of pollutants inside a street canyon were used. Buildings height, width, length and geometry, as well as the distance between the buildings and road width were tested. Besides the real actual geometry of the street, with the real disposition and volumetric confi guration of buildings, three scenarios were evaluated: (i) gaps of 4 m between the buildings along the street; (ii) gaps of 6 m between the buildings along the street and (iii) same height and width for all buildings along the street without <b>gap</b> <b>between</b> <b>buildings.</b> Wind direction, wind velocity and four pedestrian trajectories were considered. The results show that PM 10 concentration, at 1. 5 -m high plane, is highly depen-dent on street geometry and wind conditions for along-canyon wind directions (west and east wind). Lower concentration levels are obtained for confi guration (iii) because this geometry promotes the dispersion of pol-lutants under along-canyon wind direction. For cross-canyon wind directions (north and south), confi guration (i) results in lower PM 10 concentrations. There are no visible improvements in having higher gaps betwee...|$|E
40|$|Major seismic events {{during the}} past decade such as those that have {{occurred}} in Northridge, Imperial Valley (May 18, 1940), California (1994), Kobe, Japan (1995), Turkey (1999), Taiwan (1999) and Bhuj, Central Western India (2001) have continued to demonstrate the destructive power of earthquakes, with destruction of engineered buildings, bridges, industrial and port facilities as well as giving rise to great economic losses. Among the possible structural damages, seismic induced pounding has been commonly observed in several earthquakes. As a result, a parametric study on buildings pounding response as well as proper seismic hazard mitigation practice for adjacent buildings is carried out. Therefore, the needs to improve seismic performance of the built environment through the development of performance-oriented procedures have been developed. To estimate the seismic demands, nonlinearities in the structure are to be considered when the structure enters into inelastic range during devastating earthquakes. Despite the increase in the accuracy and efficiency of the computational tools related to dynamic inelastic analysis, engineers tend to adopt simplified non-linear static procedures instead of rigorous non-linear dynamic analysis when evaluating seismic demands. This is due to the problems related to its complexities and suitability for practical design applications. The push over analysis is a static, nonlinear procedure {{that can be used to}} estimate the dynamic needs imposed on a structure by earthquake ground motions. This project entitled “Seismic Pounding Effects in Buildings. ” aims at studying seismic gap between adjacent buildings by dynamic and pushover analysis in SAP 2000. A parametric study is conducted to investigate the minimum seismic pounding gap between two adjacent structures by response Spectrum analysis for medium soil and Elcentro Earthquake recorded excitation are used for input in the dynamic analysis on different models [...] The effect of impact is studied using linear and nonlinear contact force on models for different separation distances and compared with nominal model without pounding consideration. Pounding produces acceleration and shear at various story levels that are greater than those obtained from the no pounding case, while the peak drift depends on the input excitation characteristics. Also, increasing gap width is likely to be effective when the separation is sufficiently wide practically to eliminate contact. The results of pushover analysis viz. pushover curves and capacity spectrum for three different lateral load patterns are observed to study the effect of different lateral load pattern on the structural displacement to find out minimum seismic <b>gap</b> <b>between</b> <b>buildings...</b>|$|E

40|$|Four {{geometrical}} {{configurations of}} a real street canyon in Barreiro city (Portugal) are considered to study their influence on the dispersion of PM. These configurations include actual architectural layout of the street (Option 1), and three virtual cases (Options 1 - 3). Option 2 includes the modification of real geometry by including 4 m <b>gaps</b> <b>between</b> the <b>buildings</b> situated on {{the southern part of}} the street canyon. Option 3 considers 6 m <b>gaps</b> <b>between</b> <b>buildings</b> as opposed to 4 m gaps in Option 2. Option 4 assumes the same height for all buildings on {{the southern part of the}} street canyon, with no <b>gaps</b> <b>between</b> <b>buildings.</b> Computational fluid dynamics code (CFD), FLUENT, is used to simulate the detailed flow and turbulence characteristics in three-dimensional domain of chosen street canyon, together with the PM dispersion for both the summer and winter seasons. The modelled PM concentrations were then compared with the measured data at seven different locations in the street canyon. Our results indicate up to 23 % lower PM concentrations at 1. 5 m above the road level during the along-canyon wind direction due to the channelling of flow, compared with those observed during the cross-canyon wind direction. Detailed inspection of the results obtained from the Options 1 - 3 indicated that the spacing <b>between</b> the <b>buildings</b> tend to increase particle dilution during the cross-canyon winds, resulting in up to 20, and 22 % reduced concentrations for options 2, and 3 respectively, compared with the actual configuration (Option 1). The largest improvement (∼ 7 %) in the PM concentrations was given by Option 2, while other options showed modest changes. Possible reasons for these changes under varying meteorological conditions are explained in the context of changing building configurations and their implications in city planning. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
