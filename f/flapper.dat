5|$|The <b>Flapper</b> awoke {{from her}} {{lethargy}} of sub-deb-ism, bobbed her hair, {{put on her}} choicest pair of earrings {{and a great deal}} of audacity and rouge and went into the battle. She flirted because it was fun to flirt and wore a one-piece bathing suit because she had a good figure... she was conscious that the things she did were the things she had always wanted to do. Mothers disapproved of their sons taking the <b>Flapper</b> to dances, to teas, to swim and most of all to heart.|$|E
5|$|Daisy Fay Buchanan– an {{attractive}} and effervescent, if shallow and self-absorbed, young Louisville, Kentucky debutante and socialite, {{identified as a}} <b>flapper.</b> She is Nick's second cousin, once removed, and the wife of Tom Buchanan. Daisy {{is believed to have}} been inspired by Fitzgerald's own youthful romances with Ginevra King. Daisy once had a romantic relationship with Gatsby, before she married Tom. Her choice between Gatsby and Tom is one of the central conflicts in the novel.|$|E

50|$|The Republic of <b>Flappers</b> (German: Die Republik der Backfische) is a 1928 German silent comedy film {{directed}} by Constantin J. David and starring Käthe von Nagy, Raimondo Van Riel and Ernst Stahl-Nachbaur. The title refers to <b>flappers.</b>|$|R
25|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1920s, <b>flappers</b> began {{appearing}} in newspaper comic strips; Blondie Boopadoop and Fritzi Ritz – later depicted more domestically, as the wife of Dagwood Bumstead and aunt of Nancy, respectively – were introduced as <b>flappers.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1928, Crawford starred {{opposite}} Ramón Novarro in Across to Singapore, {{but it was}} {{her role}} as Diana Medford in Our Dancing Daughters (1928) that catapulted her to stardom. The role established her as a symbol of modern 1920s-style femininity which rivaled Clara Bow, the original It girl, then Hollywood's foremost <b>flapper.</b> A stream of hits followed Our Dancing Daughters, including two more flapper-themed movies, in which Crawford embodied for her legion of fans (many of whom were women) an idealized vision of the free-spirited, all-American girl.|$|E
5|$|Respiration {{involves}} drawing {{water into}} the mantle cavity through an aperture, passing it through the gills, and expelling it through the siphon. The ingress of water is achieved by contraction of radial muscles in the mantle wall, and <b>flapper</b> valves shut when strong circular muscles force the water out through the siphon. Extensive connective tissue lattices support the respiratory muscles {{and allow them to}} expand the respiratory chamber. The lamella structure of the gills allows for a high oxygen uptake; up to 65% in water at 20⁰C. Water flow over the gills correlates with locomotion, and an octopus can propel its body when it expels water out of its siphon.|$|E
5|$|Commercial artist Russell H. Tandy was {{the first}} artist to {{illustrate}} Nancy Drew. Tandy was a fashion artist and infused Nancy with a contemporary fashion sensibility: her early style {{is that of a}} flatfoot flapper: heeled Mary Janes accompany her blue <b>flapper</b> skirt suit and cloche hat on three of the first four volume dust jackets. As styles changed over the next few years, Nancy began to appear in glamorous frocks, with immaculately set hair, pearls, matching hats, gloves, and handbags. By the 1940s, Nancy wore simpler, tailored suits and outfits; her hair was often arranged in a pompadour. In the post-war era, Tandy's Nancy is shown hatless, wearing casual skirt and blouse ensembles, and carrying a purse, like most teens of the late 1940s.|$|E

5|$|Immediately after {{completing}} The Road to Glory, Hawks began writing his next film, Fig Leaves, his first (and, until 1935, only) comedy. The film portrays {{a married couple}} by juxtaposing them in the Garden of Eden and in modern New York City. The Garden of Eden humorously depicts Adam and Eve awoken by a Flintstones-like coconut alarm clock and Adam reading the morning news on giant stone tablets. In the modern day, the biblical serpent is replaced by Eve's gossiping neighbor and Eve becomes a sexy <b>flapper</b> and fashion model when Adam is at work. The film starred George O'Brien as Adam and Olive Borden as Eve and received positive reviews, particularly for the art direction and costume designs. It was released in July 1926 and was Hawks's first hit as a director. Although he mainly dismissed his early work, Hawks praised this film in later interviews.|$|E
5|$|Set on {{the prosperous}} Long Island of 1922, The Great Gatsby {{provides}} a critical {{social history of}} America during the Roaring Twenties within its fictional narrative. That era, known for unprecedented economic prosperity, the evolution of jazz music, <b>flapper</b> culture, new technologies in communication (motion pictures, broadcast radio, recorded music) forging a genuine mass culture; and bootlegging, along with other criminal activity, is plausibly depicted in Fitzgerald's novel. Fitzgerald uses these societal developments of the 1920s to build Gatsby's stories from simple details like automobiles to broader themes like Fitzgerald's discreet allusions to the organized crime culture which {{was the source of}} Gatsby's fortune. Fitzgerald educates his readers about the garish society of the Roaring Twenties by placing a timeless, relatable plotline within the historical context of the era.|$|E
5|$|In October 2016, Madonna {{announced}} plans of collaborating with Art Basel {{to revive the}} Tears of a Clown show, at a benefit gala on December 2, 2016 at Miami Beach's Faena Forum. The location was developed by Argentine hotelier and real estate developer, Alan Faena, and the show would coincide {{with the opening of}} the Forum. The concert was held along with an accompanying art auction and dinner, to benefit Madonna's Raising Malawi foundation to support their projects like Mercy James Pediatric Surgery Hospital in Malawi, as well as art and education initiatives for impoverished children in the country. Madonna herself auctioned some of her art collection, as well as never-before-seen pictures from her marriage to actor Sean Penn, photographed by Herb Ritts. Tickets were highly priced, at general admission of $5,000 with VIP meet-and-greet packages coming at $150,000. She also auctioned the <b>flapper</b> dress from Rebel Heart Tour, modelled by singer Ariana Grande during the show. Penn was present in the audience and bid on several items, and at one point handcuffed Madonna and crawled through her legs for generating a higher bid.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Flappers</b> were a {{generation}} of young Western women in the 1920s who wore short skirts, bobbed their hair, listened to jazz, and flaunted their disdain for what was then considered acceptable behavior. <b>Flappers</b> were seen as brash for wearing excessive makeup, drinking, treating sex in a casual manner, smoking, driving automobiles, and otherwise flouting social and sexual norms. [...] <b>Flappers</b> had their origins in the liberal period of the Roaring Twenties, the social, political turbulence and increased transatlantic cultural exchange that followed the end of World War I, {{as well as the}} export of American jazz culture to Europe.|$|R

5|$|Monroe {{was born}} Norma Jeane Mortenson at the Los Angeles County Hospital on June 1, 1926 {{as the third}} child of Gladys Pearl Baker (née Monroe, 1902–1984). Gladys, the {{daughter}} of two poor Midwestern migrants to California, was a <b>flapper</b> {{and worked as a}} film negative cutter at Consolidated Film Industries. When she was fifteen, Gladys married a man nine years her senior, John Newton Baker, and had two children by him, Robert (1917–1933) and Berniece (born 1919). She filed for divorce in 1921, and Baker took the children with him to his native Kentucky. Monroe was not told that she had a sister until she was twelve, and met {{her for the first time}} as an adult. In 1924, Gladys married her second husband—Martin Edward Mortensen—but they separated before she became pregnant with Monroe by a different man; they divorced in 1928. The identity of Monroe's father is unknown and Baker was most often used as her surname.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, popular {{contempt}} for Prohibition {{was a factor}} in the rise of the <b>flapper.</b> With legal saloons and cabarets closed, back alley speakeasies became prolific and popular. This discrepancy between the law-abiding, religion-based temperance movement and the actual ubiquitous consumption of alcohol led to widespread disdain for authority. <b>Flapper</b> independence was also a response to the Gibson girls of the 1890s. Although that pre-war look does not resemble the <b>flapper</b> style, their independence may have led to the <b>flapper</b> wise-cracking tenacity 30 years later.|$|E
25|$|The first {{appearance}} of the word and image in the United States came from the popular 1920 Frances Marion film, The <b>Flapper,</b> starring Olive Thomas. Thomas starred in a similar role in 1917, {{though it was not}} until The <b>Flapper</b> that the term was used. In her final movies, she was seen as the <b>flapper</b> image. Other actresses, such as Clara Bow, Louise Brooks, Colleen Moore and Joan Crawford would soon build their careers on the same image, achieving great popularity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flappers</b> was a Canadian {{television}} sitcom airing on the CBC from 1979 to 1981. It {{was set in}} a Montreal night club {{during the}} Roaring Twenties.

5000|$|Throughout the 20th century, youths had {{a strong}} {{influence}} on both lifestyle and culture. The <b>flappers</b> and the Mods are two great examples {{of the impact of}} youth culture on society. The <b>flappers</b> were young women, confident about a prosperous future after World War I, and they became the symbol of effervescence. This liveliness was seen in her new attitude in life in which she openly drank, smoked, and many socialized with gangster type men. The fashionable dress at the time also reflected the <b>flapper’s</b> new lifestyle. Hems were raised, waists dropped, and hair was cut into bobs. This not only created a look that was dramatically different from the corseted, structured dresses of previous generations, but it also created a new freedom that allowed the wearer to move in ways one was unable to before. This break from older values was also apparent in a new posture embraced by the <b>flappers.</b> Instead of an upright, corseted posture, they preferred [...] "a ‘lop-sided’ stance characterized by ‘sunken chests and round shoulders,’ which suggested fatigue rather than beauty." [...] The <b>flappers</b> exemplified how youth culture was influential in fashion and lifestyle.|$|R

2500|$|For all {{the concern}} about women {{stepping}} out of their traditional roles, however, many <b>flappers</b> were not engaged in politics. In fact, older suffragettes, who fought for the right for women to vote, viewed <b>flappers</b> as vapid {{and in some ways}} unworthy of the enfranchisement they had worked so hard to win. Dorothy Dunbar Bromley, a noted liberal writer at the time, summed up this dichotomy by describing <b>flappers</b> as [...] "truly modern", [...] "New Style" [...] feminists who [...] "admit that a full life calls for marriage and children" [...] and also [...] "are moved by an inescapable inner compulsion to be individuals in their own right".|$|R

25|$|It wasn’t {{until the}} Wall Street {{stock market crash}} of 1929 that the roaring 20’s era of glitz and glamour came to an end, and with it, the <b>flapper</b> dress. Unable to afford the latest trends and lifestyle, the once vibrant <b>flapper</b> women {{returned}} to their dropped hemlines. A sudden serious tone washed over the public {{with the appearance of}} The Great Depression. Transitioning into the thirties was no easy task. Campaigns such as the “Make do and Mend” slogan were becoming prevalent to ensure there was no overconsumption throughout society. Fabric choices were among the many items to be cut back on during this poverty-stricken time. Artificial fabrics were used instead of elegant fabrics, like silk, which were so popular in the early 1900s. No longer were party dresses adorned with decorative embellishments or made brightly colored. Instead, women headed to work to take over men’s roles while they were at war. The physically demanding jobs called for the creation and social acceptance of women’s pants in society. Although the era of the <b>flapper</b> had vanished almost overnight, its symbol for women’s liberation would live on. No longer would a woman have to be a homemaker. The freedom to choose her role in society was created. Even though many opposed the radical era, one can see how the <b>flapper</b> dress helped bridge a gap between genders in society, ultimately leading in the direction of women’s rights.|$|E
