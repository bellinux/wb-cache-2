40|$|OBJECTIVE: Silent brain <b>infarctions</b> are {{the silent}} {{cerebrovascular}} {{events that are}} distinguished from symptomatic lacunar <b>infarctions</b> by their 'silence'; the origin of these <b>infarctions</b> is still unclear. This study analyzed the characteristics of silent and symptomatic lacunar <b>infarctions</b> and sought to explore the mechanism of this 'silence'. METHODS: In total, 156 patients with only silent brain <b>infarctions,</b> 90 with only symptomatic lacunar <b>infarctions,</b> 160 with both silent and symptomatic lacunar <b>infarctions,</b> and 115 without any <b>infarctions</b> were recruited. Vascular risk factors, leukoaraiosis, and vascular assessment results were compared. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores were compared between patients with only symptomatic lacunar <b>infarctions</b> and patients with two types of <b>infarctions.</b> The locations {{of all of the}} <b>infarctions</b> were evaluated. The evolution of the two types of <b>infarctions</b> was retrospectively studied by comparing the infarcts on the magnetic resonance images of 63 patients obtained at different times. RESULTS: The main risk factors for silent brain <b>infarctions</b> were hypertension, age, and advanced leukoaraiosis; the main factors for symptomatic lacunar <b>infarctions</b> were hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and atherosclerosis of relevant arteries. The neurological deficits of patients with only symptomatic lacunar <b>infarctions</b> were more severe than those of patients with both types of <b>infarctions.</b> More silent brain <b>infarctions</b> were located in the corona radiata and basal ganglia; these locations were {{different from those of the}} symptomatic lacunar <b>infarctions.</b> The initial sizes of the symptomatic lacunar <b>infarctions</b> were larger than the silent brain <b>infarctions,</b> whereas the final sizes were almost equal between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic ischemic preconditioning and nonstrategic locations may be the main reasons for the 'silence' of silent brain <b>infarctions...</b>|$|R
40|$|We use {{medical data}} of acute {{myocardial}} <b>infarctions</b> for 5 {{hospitals in the}} city of Havana covering an estimated population of 850 000 inhabitants during the years 1992 to 1999. We analyze the occurrence of <b>infarctions</b> in relation to geomagnetic activity through the Ap index considering low and high activity levels. The distribution of the <b>infarctions</b> in geomagnetically calm (Ap 50 g) periods is different. Performing a superposed epoch analysis, we notice a prominent maximum in the distribution of <b>infarctions</b> one day after the Ap maximum. We conclude that the acute myocardial <b>infarctions</b> morbidity seems to be responding to a threshold level of Ap between 20 - 50 g...|$|R
5000|$|Myocardial <b>infarctions</b> are {{generally}} clinically classified into ST elevation MI (STEMI) and non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI). These {{are based on}} changes to an ECG. STEMIs make up about 25 - 40% of myocardial <b>infarctions.</b> A more explicit classification system, based on international consensus in 2012, also exists. This classifies myocardial <b>infarctions</b> into five types: ...|$|R
5|$|It is {{recommended}} that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the pituitary gland is performed if the diagnosis is suspected; this has a sensitivity of over 90% for detecting pituitary apoplexy; it may demonstrate <b>infarction</b> (tissue damage due to a decreased blood supply) or hemorrhage. Different MRI sequences {{can be used to}} establish when the apoplexy occurred, and the predominant form of damage (hemorrhage or <b>infarction).</b> If MRI is not suitable (e.g. due to claustrophobia or the presence of metal-containing implants), a computed tomography (CT) scan may demonstrate abnormalities in the pituitary gland, although it is less reliable. Many pituitary tumors (25%) are found to have areas of hemorrhagic <b>infarction</b> on MRI scans, but apoplexy is not said to exist unless it is accompanied by symptoms.|$|E
5|$|The {{pituitary}} gland {{is located in}} a recess in the skull base known as the sella turcica ("Turkish saddle", after its shape). It is attached to the hypothalamus, a part of the brain, by a stalk that also contains the blood vessels that supply the gland. It is unclear why pituitary tumors are five times more likely to bleed than other tumors in the brain. There are various proposed mechanisms by which a tumor can increase the risk of either <b>infarction</b> (insufficient blood supply leading to tissue dysfunction) or hemorrhage. The {{pituitary gland}} normally derives its blood supply from vessels that pass through the hypothalamus, but tumors develop a blood supply from the nearby inferior hypophyseal artery that generates a higher blood pressure, possibly accounting for the risk of bleeding. Tumors may also be more sensitive to fluctuations in blood pressure, and the blood vessels may show structural abnormalities that make them vulnerable to damage. It has been suggested that <b>infarction</b> alone causes milder symptoms than either hemorrhage or hemorrhagic <b>infarction</b> (<b>infarction</b> followed by hemorrhage into the damaged tissue). Larger tumors are more prone to bleeding, and more rapidly growing lesions (as evidenced by detection of increased levels of the protein PCNA) may also be at a higher risk of apoplexy.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{medical care}} applies to other acute health {{problems}} as well. Many illnesses with time-sensitive elements {{are common in}} developing countries, including severe infections, hypoxia caused by respiratory infections, dehydration caused by diarrhoea, intentional and unintentional injuries, postpartum bleeding, and acute myocardial <b>infarction.</b> These are potentially life-threatening conditions, yet effective treatment is often unavailable {{for much of the}} world's population.|$|E
50|$|Although how {{perioperative}} myocardial <b>infarctions</b> {{should be}} treated remains under active investigation, it is nonetheless well worth monitoring troponin to screen for <b>infarctions</b> because the prognosis is poor, and <b>infarctions</b> represent opportunities to make sure blood pressure, heart rate, and lipids are controlled. They are also an opportunity for life-style guidance, including recommendations related to smoking cessation, exercise, and diet.|$|R
50|$|In contrast, {{studies by}} Pierrot-Deseilligny et al. {{correlated}} high error rates of AS to specific lesions in the {{dorsolateral prefrontal cortex}} (DLPFC). In this study, patients with unilateral <b>infarctions</b> of the posterior parietal lobe were compared against <b>infarctions</b> in 3 frontal regions: the supplementary motor area, frontal eye fields (FEF), and the DLPFC. Only patients with <b>infarctions</b> of the DLPFC showed statistically significant error rates.|$|R
40|$|Depression has {{recently}} been associated with lesions in the CNS, particularly with large <b>infarctions</b> in the cerebral hemispheres. We report a patient in whom two episodes of acute depression were related to relapsing paramedian thalamic <b>infarctions,</b> which were accompanied by additional transient mild neuropsychological deficits, hypersomnia and a discrete sensory disturbance of the left face. Thalamic <b>infarctions</b> {{have been shown to}} mimic a variety of higher functional deficits, such as aphasias, apraxias and attentional disorders, traditionally associated with hemispheric strokes. We conjecture that the paramedian thalamic <b>infarctions</b> observed in our patient have in a similar manner been responsible for the transient depression...|$|R

5|$|In general, for adults, doses {{are taken}} {{four times a}} day for fever or arthritis, with doses near the maximal daily dose used {{historically}} for the treatment of rheumatic fever.

5|$|Prostaglandins, local hormones {{produced}} in the body, have diverse effects, including the transmission of pain information to the brain, modulation of the hypothalamic thermostat, and inflammation.

5|$|There {{are various}} neuroimaging {{investigations}} that may detect cerebral sinus thrombosis. Cerebral edema and venous <b>infarction</b> may be apparent on any modality, {{but for the}} detection of the thrombus itself, the most commonly used tests are computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), both using various types of radiocontrast to perform a venogram and visualise the veins around the brain.|$|E
25|$|Because aortic {{dissection}} {{may present}} {{to the emergency room}} physician similar to a myocardial <b>infarction,</b> the physician must be careful to make the proper diagnosis prior to initiating treatment for myocardial <b>infarction</b> since the treatment regimen for myocardial <b>infarction</b> can be lethal to an individual presenting with aortic dissection.|$|E

25|$|Myocardial <b>infarction</b> (heart attack) {{occurs in}} 1–2% of aortic dissections. The {{cause of the}} <b>infarction</b> is {{involvement}} of the coronary arteries, which supply the heart, in the dissection. The right coronary artery is involved more commonly than the left coronary artery. If the myocardial <b>infarction</b> is treated with thrombolytic therapy, the mortality increases to over 70%, mostly due to bleeding into the pericardial sac causing pericardial tamponade.|$|E
25|$|These micro RNAs have pivotal {{roles in}} {{development}} and physiology of muscle tissues including the heart. MiR-1 {{is known to}} be involved in important role in heart diseases such as hypertrophy, myocardial <b>infarction,</b> and arrhythmias. Studies have shown that MiR-1 is an important regulator of heart adaption after ischemia or ischaemic stress and it is upregulated in the remote myocardium of patients with myocardial <b>infarction.</b> Also MiR-1 is downregulated in myocardial infarcted tissue compared to healthy heart tissue. Plasma levels of MiR-1 {{can be used as a}} sensitive biomarker for myocardial <b>infarction.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Belfast {{system was}} {{established}} to reach patients with acute myocardial <b>infarction.</b> The resuscitated patients were those whose hearts fibrillated after the ambulance was at the scene or en route. The system reacted too slowly to resuscitate persons who fibrillated before the call was placed.

5000|$|... "Silent" [...] {{myocardial}} <b>infarctions</b> {{can happen}} without any symptoms at all. These cases can be discovered later on electrocardiograms, using blood enzyme tests, or at autopsy after {{a person has}} died. Such silent myocardial <b>infarctions</b> represent between 22 and 64% of all <b>infarctions,</b> and are {{more common in the}} elderly, in those with diabetes mellitus and after heart transplantation. In people with diabetes, differences in pain threshold, autonomic neuropathy, and psychological factors have been cited as possible explanations for the lack of symptoms. In heart transplantation, the donor heart is not fully innervated by the nervous system of the recipient.|$|R

25|$|It {{can also}} be used as a marker of {{myocardial}} <b>infarction.</b> Following a myocardial <b>infarction,</b> levels of LDH peak at 3–4 days and remain elevated for up to 10 days. In this way, elevated levels of LDH (where the level of LDH1 is higher than that of LDH2, i.e. the LDH Flip, as normally, in serum, LDH2 is higher than LDH1) can be useful for determining whether a patient has had a myocardial <b>infarction</b> if they come to doctors several days after an episode of chest pain.|$|E
