The line had been difficult and costly to construct. Why Wright sought {{to get involved in the}} company is contentious; he was a mining engineer, not a construction or railroad engineer. It is likely that Wright believed he would be able to cap his career in City finance if he were knighted for his public spirited activity. In any case the bond <b>issue</b> was <b>a</b> disaster—Wright found it strained his resources, and few people were willing to subscribe. It started the collapse of the entire Wright group.|$|R
25|$|The {{heritage}} of the House of Morgan traces its roots to the partnership of Drexel, Morgan & Co., which in 1895 was renamed J.P. Morgan & Co. (see also: J. Pierpont Morgan). Arguably the most influential financial institution of its era, J.P. Morgan & Co. financed {{the formation of the}} United States Steel Corporation, which took over the business of Andrew Carnegie and others and was the world's first billion dollar corporation. In 1895, J.P. Morgan & Co. supplied the United States government with $62million in gold to <b>float</b> <b>a</b> bond <b>issue</b> and restore the treasury surplus of $100million. In 1892, the company began to finance the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad and led it through a series of acquisitions that made it the dominant railroad transporter in New England.|$|R

The company preferred to locate the school at Macon, but too many other Air Corps activities already existed in the area. Douglas became the second choice because the company already had a school in place. The City of Douglas and Coffee County welcomed the proposal and <b>floated</b> <b>a</b> bond <b>issue</b> to finance <b>a</b> portion of the project. In May 1941, an additional 700 acre were purchased to enlarge the airport. The construction of the cantonment area at Douglas Army Airfield was of concrete and tile buildings and began on 29 June 1941. The three hangars were constructed of steel.

5000|$|Breaking their prior {{silence on}} the issue, Read joined on February 15 with the {{incoming}} Secretary of State, fellow state Land Board member Republican Dennis Richardson, the two constituting a majority, to vote against Governor Kate Brown's proposal to <b>float</b> <b>a</b> bond <b>issue</b> to keep the 82,500-acre Elliott State Forest in public hands. Instead they advanced a proposal {{to sell it to}} the Lone Rock Timber corporation, whose $221 million bid included partnering with the Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Tribe of Indians. Outgoing Land Board member Wheeler had voted in December 2016 to keep the forest public. Read had received $3,000 in campaign contributions from Lone Rock, $3,750 from the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde, of which the Umpqua tribe is a member, $2,500 from Roseburg Forest Products, and a total of $15,750 from the logging and forest products industries. Richardson received $11,000 from Lone Rock, then $10,000 from the Cow Creek Band after he won office. Read's vote particularly irked environmental groups, because he pledged to preserve the Elliott Forest as he campaigned and had introduced legislation in 2015, similar as was done in Washington state, to protect it from exploitation and privatization. Asked about his role reversal, Read said he was, [...] "...in a different role now." ...|$|R
