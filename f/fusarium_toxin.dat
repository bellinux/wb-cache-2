For this purpose, fourteen ruminal and duodenal fistulated dairy cows were fed a diet containing 60 % concentrate with a wheat portion of 55 % (<b>Fusarium</b> <b>toxin</b> contaminated wheat [mycotoxin period] or control wheat [control period]) and ration was completed with maize- and grass silage (50 : 50) on a DM basis. Daily DON intakes ranged from 16. 6 up to 75. 6 mg in the mycotoxin period at DM intakes of 5. 6 up to 20. 5 kg. DON was almost completely biotransformed to de-epoxy DON (94 - 99 %) independent of the DON/feed intake, and the flow of DON and de-epoxy DON at the duodenum related to DON intake ranged between 12 and 77 % when the <b>Fusarium</b> <b>toxin</b> contaminated wheat was fed. In the serum samples, de-epoxy DON was detected in the range of 4 up to 28 ng/ml in the mycotoxin period, while concentrations of DON were all below the detection limit. The daily excretion of DON and de-epoxy DON in the milk of cows fed the contaminated wheat varied between 1 and 10 µg and 14 and 104 µg, respectively. The total carry over rates as the ratio between daily excretion of DON and de-epoxy DON into milk and DON intake were in the range of 0. 0001 up to 0. 0002 and 0. 0004 up to 0. 0024, respectively. Total carry over rates of DON as DON and de-epoxy DON into the milk increased significantly with increasing milk yield. In the urine samples, de-epoxy DON was the predominant substance as compared to DON with a portion of the total DON plus de-epoxy DON concentration up to 96 % when the <b>Fusarium</b> <b>toxin</b> contaminated wheat was fed, whereas the total residues of DON plus de-epoxy DON in faeces ranged between 2 and 18 % of DON intake in the mycotoxin period.

40|$|<b>Fusarium</b> <b>toxins</b> {{have been}} arousing public {{interest}} in recent years because of their potential health hazards for humans and agricultural livestock. It was hypothesized that selected pro-inflammatory cytokines might serve as sensitive biomarkers of the predicted adverse effects of <b>Fusarium</b> <b>toxins</b> {{on the basis of}} their potential ability to induce immune and intestinal alterations comparable to those in human chronic inflammatory infection. Consequently, the aim of this study was to elucidate individual and combined effects of four common <b>Fusarium</b> <b>toxins,</b> deoxynivalenol (DON), nivalenol (NIV), zearalenone (ZEA) and fumonisin B 1 (FB 1) on the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL 1 alpha, IL 1 beta, IL 6, IL 8, TNFalpha and MCP- 1) using a porcine jejunal epithelial cell line, IPEC-J 2. Based on a dose-response relationship between individual mycotoxins and cell viability (MTT assay) that was previously established, cytotoxic and non-cytotoxic concentrations were selected to investigate combinations of two, three and all four of the mycotoxins. In general, up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA expression occurred for both individual and mixtures of <b>Fusarium</b> <b>toxins</b> at cytotoxic concentrations, whereas significant up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA mostly obtained when the toxins existed in mixtures at non-cytotoxic concentrations and these mixtures were found to cause cytotoxicity from MTT assay determined previously. Therefore, it may be concluded that some of the changes in the mRNA expression of IL 1 alpha, IL 1 beta, IL 6, IL 8, TNFalpha and MCP- 1 could be cytotoxicity-related. It was also noted that additive effects were not always observed for the mixtures. These data suggest that individual or mixtures of <b>Fusarium</b> <b>toxins</b> could cause or exacerbate intestinal inflammation.

However, data on the exposure of humans to these toxins through consumption of tissues of animals exposed to Fusarium toxins (carry over) are still fragmentary. Therefore, the residues of DON, ZON and their metabolites were determined in tissues and body fluids of pigs (female and castrated male) from a fattening trial which were fed a control (n = 6, 0. 24 mg DON and 0. 009 mg ZON per kg diet as fed) or a <b>Fusarium</b> <b>toxin</b> contaminated diet (n = 12, 6. 68 mg DON and 0. 056 mg ZON per kg diet as fed) either for ad libitum or restrictive consumption for 12 weeks. After slaughter (96. 3 ± 11. 6 kg live weight), the concentrations of DON and its metabolite de-epoxy-DON were measured in serum, bile, liver, kidney, musculus longissimus and back fat, while ZON and its metabolites α- and β-zearalenol (α-/β-ZOL) were determined in serum, bile and liver. The mean carry over factor of DON + de-epoxy-DON, defined as the concentration of both substances in the tissue/fluid divided by the DON concentration in the diet, for all pigs decreased from bile (0. 1046 ± 0. 0653) >> kidney (0. 0151 ± 0. 0070) > liver (0. 0057 ± 0. 0043) > serum (0. 0023 ± 0. 0018) > muscle (0. 0016 ± 0. 0016) >> back fat (0. 0002 ± 0. 0004). The time interval between the end of feeding and slaughter had no consistent effect on DON + de-epoxy-DON concentrations in the analyzed specimen of <b>Fusarium</b> <b>toxin</b> exposed pigs fed restrictively.

40|$|Deoxynivalenol (DON) is {{a common}} <b>Fusarium</b> <b>toxin</b> in poultry feed. Chickens are more {{resistant}} to the adverse impacts of deoxynivalenol (DON) compared to other species. In general, the acute form of DON mycotoxicosis rarely occurs in poultry flocks under normal conditions. However, if diets contain low levels of DON (less than 5 mg DON/kg diet), lower productivity, impaired immunity and higher susceptibility to infectious diseases can occur. The molecular mechanism of action of DON has not been completely understood. A significant influence of DON in chickens is the impairment of immunological functions. It was known that low doses of DON elevated the serum IgA levels and affected both cell-mediated and humoral immunity in animals. DON is shown to suppress the antibody response to infectious bronchitis vaccine (IBV) and to Newcastle disease virus (NDV) in broilers (10 mg DON/kg feed) and laying hens (3. 5 to 14 mg of DON/kg feed), respectively. Moreover, DON (10 mg DON/kg feed) decreased tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in the plasma of broilers. DON can severely affect the immune system and, due to its negative impact on performance and productivity, can eventually result in high economic losses to poultry producers.

Thus, the aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate in the interactive effect of binary <b>Fusarium</b> <b>toxins</b> FB 1 and ZEA on intestinal cells line Caco- 2 using several cellular endpoints such as caspace- 3 activity modulation, malonedialdehyde (MDA) production, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage as necrosis measure and cells viability as evaluated by lysosome and mitochondria integrities. As results, ZEA + FB 1 led to an antagonistic effect on lysosome and mitochondria damage but, the necrosisinduced was more potent when compared to ZEA or FB 1 alone showing an additive effect. Moreover, MDA production induced by ZEA+FB 1 was higher than additive effect but not synergistic effect. At last, the combined effect of toxins on key apoptosis enzyme caspace- 3 kinetic activity was an additive effect after 6 h and 24 h but, after 3 h, ZEA tended to exert its anti-apoptotic action by reducing the enzyme activation by FB 1.

For sample preparation a time-effective and straightforward ‘dilute and shoot’ protocol was applied. The chromatographic run time was minimized to 9 min including proper column re-equilibration. In-house validation of the method verified its linear range, intra- (1 – 7 %) and interday (8 – 20 %) precision, instrumental LODs between 0. 6 and 10 ngmL− 1, selectivity and moderate matrix effects with mean recoveries of 85 – 103 %. To prove the methods applicability, we analyzed two sets of wheat extracts obtained from different cultivars grown under standardized greenhouse conditions.

40|$|International audienceDeoxynivalenol (DON) is {{of great}} {{importance}} among food contaminants because of its frequent occurrence in toxicologically relevant concentrations worldwide. Since the toxin production depends strongly on environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity, a <b>Fusarium</b> <b>toxin</b> contamination can not be avoided completely. Therefore, exposure to this toxin is a permanent health risk for both humans and farm animals. As cereal crops are commonly contaminated with DON and animal diets consist mainly of cereals, it can be assumed that animals are frequently exposed to DON contaminated feeds. Many strategies can be undertaken to reduce the toxic effect of DON. In addition to the general necessity for minimizing all risk factors that might influence the contamination of cereals with DON, such as the so-called field toxins before harvest, several post harvest strategies {{can be applied to}} counteract possible deleterious effects of this mycotoxin in farm animals. An interesting approach for decontamination in feedstuffs is the use of adsorbent materials. Adsorbent materials may bind mycotoxins in the gastrointestinal tract and reduce the absorption and systemic toxicity. It was shown that some adsorbents are suitable to alleviate the toxic effects of specific mycotoxins, but its efficacy against trichothecenes is practically zero. Therefore, alternative strategies to reduce animal and human health risk are needed. The use of microbial additives is a method, which uses microorganisms having the capability to detoxify mycotoxins by metabolism or degradation prior to their resorption in the gastrointestinal tract. DON has been reported to be completely transformed to de-epoxy-DON by ruminal and intestinal microflora. Anaerobic Eubacterium sp. was capable of DON degradation and counteracted the toxic effects of DON in animals. This review focuses on the efficacy of microbial feed additives in ameliorating the toxic effects of DON. According to the results of experiments to date, it appears that microorganisms are the main living organisms applicable for mycotoxin biodegradation. However, the use of biotransformation approach depends on its effectiveness from both the practical and economic standpoints.

The focus of this current review is the evaluation of agronomic practises aimed to modulate “natural toxins”. In order to identify what is known about the agronomic effects and how they might potentially be manipulated to reduce toxin levels, it is necessary to analyse the relationship between toxins, crops and agricultural practises. In this discussion paper we will deal first with two major food crops (cereals and potatoes) and their food safety. We will then deal with agronomic factors and their effects on different crops, and also on fungal strains, and the occurrence of mycotoxins or the occurrence of inherent toxins on different food crops. Detoxification is considered outside the scope of this review. As starting point the two key food crops in Europe, cereals and potatoes, were selected. The intention was to develop an inventory of the current agronomic practices applied {{in order to reduce the}} concentration of inherent plant toxins and mycotoxins.

The maximum level of DON in unprocessed wheat has been set at 1250 µg/kg and 1750 µg/kg for soft and durum wheat, respectively. Risk management procedures, aimed to limit mycotoxin contamination, must be applied through the entire cereal supply chain, {{to comply with the}} legal limits. As contamination occurs mainly during the cropping period, predicting DON contamination in wheat kernels at harvest can support decision making for tactic and strategic actions. For this reason, several mathematical models have been developed to predict FHB and/or DON in small grain cereals. Mathematical models can be distinguished based on the approach followed for their development into mechanistic (or explanatory) and empirical (or descriptive). The former are drawn considering the cause-effect relationship among variables, while the latter describe the relation between the driving factors of the phenomena and are developed by statistical analyses of data collected in field. To date, one mechanistic model for the prediction of DON in wheat has been published, aimed to predict Fusarium spp. infection pressure and risk for DON contamination at wheat harvest. Among the other models for DON in wheat published, a neural network was considered while the empirical approach was applied in several models. Among these, an empirical model was developed with the aim to predict DON contamination in wheat at harvest with output information destined to different groups of end-users. This study aimed to evaluate the predictive performance of an empirical and a mechanistic model for DON in wheat at harvest when used in other geographic areas. To this end, the mechanistic model developed in Italy and the empirical model developed in the Netherlands were used, as well as data collected in these two countries during 2001 - 2011. Results showed that predictions of both modelling approaches for independent wheat fields (sampled in Italy and The Netherlands) were good. Both models predicted correctly around 90 % of the samples, to contain DON in kernels below the legal limit...|$|E

40|$|The most {{important}} <b>Fusarium</b> <b>toxins</b> that may potentially affect human and animals’ health are trichothecenes such as nivalenol (NIV), deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenone (ZEA) and fumonisin B 1 (FB 1). Combined effects of <b>Fusarium</b> <b>toxins</b> are of great concerns {{because of their}} wide co-occurrence in foodstuff. Investigations on the combined effects of these mycotoxins are scarce and only {{few studies have been}} reported previously using endpoints that include inhibition of protein and DNA syntheses, DNA methylation and fragmentation, cell viability and proliferation. Yet, the combined effects of mycotoxins on the intestinal immunological defense mechanisms are poorly understood. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in using probiotic bacteria in inhibiting the absorption of mycotoxins from consumed food in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. In this research project, the effects of individual and mixtures of <b>Fusarium</b> <b>toxins,</b> DON, NIV, ZEA and FB 1 on the immunomodulation of antimicrobial peptides, cytokines and mucus production in the intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) were first investigated in vitro. In vivo experiments were also conducted to mimic conditions inside the intestinal tract to evaluate the potential protective capacity of probiotic bacteria to interfere with the adverse effects of <b>Fusarium</b> <b>toxins.</b> In vitro studies clearly demonstrated the ability of DON, NIV, ZEA and FB 1 to differentially modulate the synthesis and secretion antimicrobial peptides, proinflammatory cytokines and secretory mucins. When mycotoxin combinations were assessed, toxicity effects were shown to be additive in most of the toxin mixtures, though non-additive interactions were observed in some of the mixtures. In vivo studies have shown that chronic ingestion of DON/ZEA mix induced histological changes, reduced tight junction protein gene expression, and modulated plasma cytokine and serum immunoglobulin (Ig) levels. Supplementation of Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG (LGG) before and after DON/ZEA exposure in mice can improve, in certain extent, the intestinal barrier functions, as shown by increased tight junction protein expression, regulation of goblet cell mucus secretion, improvement of the local intestinal immune function as well as inhibition of inflammatory responses in the intestine. These changes may be associated with changes in gut microbiota composition. In summary, these results show that DON, NIV, ZEA and FB 1 expressed different responses on intestinal immunological defence mechanism through the modulation of antimicrobial peptides, cytokines and mucus synthesis, which are of significant relevance to the risk assessment process. LGG can beneficially modulate the mycotoxin-compromised enterocytes-mediated defense responses by reducing inflammatory atmosphere, enhancement of intestinal barrier and alteration of the gut microbiota. Future studies for the properties and mechanism of probiotics as means of mycotoxin intervention will be warranted. These will provide a greater understanding of potential novel nutritional modalities to reduce exposure to <b>Fusarium</b> <b>toxins</b> and their combinations. published_or_final_versionBiological SciencesDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

Three trichothecenes (deoxynivalenol [DON], 15 -acetyldeoxynivalenol [15 -ADON], and nivalenol [NIV]) and zearalenone (ZEA) were detected in corn samples, and DON, NIV, and ZEA were found in wheat samples. Compared with Shangqiu corn, the incidence and mean level of DON in Linxian were 2. 4 and 5. 8 times higher, respectively, and those of 15 -ADON were 16. 3 and 2. 6 times higher, respectively. The incidence and level of trichothecenes in wheat samples were significantly lower than those in corn. However, the level of DON in Linxian wheat was 3. 3 times higher than in Shangqiu wheat.

40|$|Mycotoxins {{are gaining}} utmost {{importance}} {{due to the}} fact that aflatoxins were found to be natural carcinogens prevailing in food and feedstuffs. Chronic health risks are particularly prevalent in India where the diets of the people are highly prone to mycotoxins due to poor harvesting practices, improper storage and transport. The <b>Fusarium</b> <b>toxins</b> of greatest concern are fumonisins, trichothecenes (deoxynivalenol (DON) and T- 2 toxin) and zearalenone. The current paper describes the disease outbreaks of <b>Fusarium</b> <b>toxins</b> in India due to ingestion of mycotoxin-contaminated food. DON was implicated in an outbreak of emetic syndrome in Kashmir State. An outbreak of acute foodborne disease caused by fumonisin has been reported in south India during 1995 affecting 1, 424 people due to contaminated sorghum and maize. Trichothecenes have been involved in an acute human mycotoxicosis known as alimentary toxic aleukia (ATA) in India during 1987 and were attributed to the consumption of mouldy wheat. These outbreaks continue to be a significant health problem of people in India because of their poor purchasing ability that compels them to consume contaminated food...|$|R

The separation of 20 <b>Fusarium</b> <b>toxins</b> with good peak shapes was achieved using a pentafluorophenyl column, and Orbitrap MS was able to detect accurately from cereal matrix components within ± 0. 77 ppm. The samples were prepared using a QuEChERS kit for extraction and a multifunctional cartridge for purification. The linearity, repeatability, and recovery of the method were > 0. 9964, 0. 8 %– 14. 7 %, and 71 %– 106 %, respectively. Using this method, an analysis of 34 commercially available cereals detected the presence of deoxynivalenol, 15 -acetyl deoxynivalenol, fumonisin B 1, fumonisin B 2, fumonisin B 3, fumonisn A 1, fumonisin A 2, fumonisin A 3, and zearalenone in corn samples with high concentration and frequency. Trichothecenes was detected from wheat samples with high frequency; in particular, the concentration of deoxynivalenol was high.

40|$|Fusarium {{head blight}} and the {{contamination}} of cereals with the <b>Fusarium</b> <b>toxins</b> deoxynivalenol (DON) and zearalenone is more prevalent when fields are not tilled {{in order to}} conserve the soil structure. DON impairs the feed intake and {{the growth rate of}} young pigs, whereas both, DON and zearalenone affect the fertility of sows. In two feeding trials using a total of 220 weaner pigs the hypothesis was tested that apple pomace alleviates the negative effects of <b>Fusarium</b> <b>toxins.</b> The two experiments had a 2 x 2 factorial design: Fusarium contaminated and uncontaminated wheat, and 8 % apple pomace and no pomace in the diet. In both trials, the animals receiving the mycotoxin contaminated diets without pomace gained less weight than the pigs receiving either uncontaminated diets without pomace (p = 0. 03 and = 0. 11) or contaminated diets with pomace (p = 0. 07 and = 0. 03). In the second trial, female piglets receiving the contaminated diets which contained zearalenone as well as DON had heavier uteri than those on uncontaminated diets (p = 0. 003), regardless of apple pomace supplementation. In conclusion, apple pomace may be used to counteract the negative effects of DON on growth, but is ineffective against the oestrogenic effects of zearalenone...|$|R
40|$|The {{contamination}} of food commodities by mycotoxins (aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, <b>Fusarium</b> <b>toxins)</b> which are health hazardous and carcinogenic secondary metabolites produced by different fungi (Aspergillus flavus, A. carbonarius, Fusarium verticillioides), {{has to be}} strictly controlled to safeguard human and animal health. Extant control methods are mainly based on chemical strategy (pesticides and fungicides). However, the use of substances synthesised by some basidiomycetes with a lower {{impact on the environment}} and on human health have produced encouraging results. Trametes versicolor is a basidiomycete known for its therapeutic effects mainly based on the production of several glycoproteins and exoglucans which display anti-tumoral action and anti-oxidative effects. The semi-purified exo-polysaccharides and glycoproteins secreted by this mushroom had previously shown the ability to inhibit the biosynthesis of different mycotoxins (aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, <b>Fusarium</b> <b>toxins).</b> In this study, the exo-polysaccharidic component secreted T. versicolor was purified by chromatographic separation techniques (Sephacryl S- 300) and analysed by 1 H- and 13 C-NMR. Two-dimensional HSQC and COSY analysis have revealed the presence of highly complexed a-glucans with a mol. wt of ca. 50 kDa. We hypothesise that these fungal polysaccharides can act as non-self signals capable of modulating secondary metabolism in mycotoxigenic fungi. The results obtained are promising in view of the implementation of a more environment friendly strategy, so as to achieve a better control of different toxins that are often concomitantly present in foods and feeds...|$|R
