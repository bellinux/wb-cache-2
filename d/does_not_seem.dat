5|$|On Baldwin's {{death the}} castle was {{inherited}} by his daughter, Adeliza, {{but the family}} appear to have taken {{little interest in the}} property. Okehampton Castle <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to have played a part in the civil war from 1139 and 1153 known as the Anarchy.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} pitched and written by John Swartzwelder. The writing staff {{had to find}} a new angle for Homer's weight problems, as the idea had been used several times before. This was {{emphasized}} in this episode when Marge <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to care that Homer {{is going to try to}} lose weight again.|$|E
5|$|A 2012 {{study by}} Schott and David C. Evans {{found that the}} number {{and shape of the}} {{individual}} nodes on the squamosal shelf of the examined S. validum skulls varied considerably, and that this variability <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to correlate with ontogenic changes, but was due to individual variation. These researchers found no correlation between the width of supratemporal fenestrae {{and the size of the}} squamosal.|$|E
60|$|It <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> {{strange that}} {{she turned to}} me without anger, that she <b>did</b> <b>not</b> seek to release her arm. It <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> strange that her look had in it a {{gentleness}} as she spoke.|$|R

5|$|A {{closely related}} problem {{concerns}} sets of integers {{in which each}} integer in the set is a divisor, but not necessarily a proper divisor, of one plus {{the product of the}} other integers in the set. This problem <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to have been named in the literature, and will be referred to as the improper Znám problem. Any solution to Znám's problem is also a solution to the improper Znám problem, but not necessarily vice versa.|$|E
5|$|A few {{attempts}} {{to build a}} cat census have been made over the years, both through associations or national and international organizations (such as the Canadian Federation of Humane Societies's one) and over the net, but such a task <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> simple to achieve. General estimates for the global population of domestic cats range widely from anywhere between 200 million to 600 million.|$|E
5|$|According to a {{mitochondrial}} DNA analysis, {{the black}} wildebeest {{seem to have}} diverged from the main lineage during the Middle Pleistocene and became a distinct species around a million years ago. A divergence rate of approximately 2% has been calculated. The split <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to have been driven by competition for resources but instead {{by the fact that}} each species adopted a different ecological niche and occupied a different trophic level.|$|E

Her face was pale and rigid, her eyes wide open, her expression one of horror rather than relief.|$|R
5|$|As Olivia {{enters the}} park, she is {{passed by a}} man riding a penny-farthing bicycle. As these have not been shown elsewhere, it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> likely {{that they are a}} common means of {{transportation}} in the alternate universe, but rather that this is a reference to The Prisoner, in which similar mind-games were used against an agent being held prisoner.|$|E
5|$|Diuretics {{have been}} {{associated}} with attacks of gout. However, a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to increase risk. Other medications that increase the risk include niacin, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (except losartan), beta blockers, ritonavir, and pyrazinamide. The immunosuppressive drugs ciclosporin and tacrolimus are also associated with gout, the former more so when used in combination with hydrochlorothiazide.|$|E
5|$|In 1549, Robert Kett led an {{uprising}} in Norfolk; marching on Norwich, his army camped on the north-east {{side of the}} river, overlooking Cow Tower. Two rebel attacks were then made across the river into the Hospital meadows, {{in an attempt to}} take Bishop Bridge, which would have given them access to the city. Kett had brought artillery, which he turned on the Cow Tower, damaging the latter's parapets. The rebellion failed, and the tower <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to have required extensive repairs.|$|E

5|$|In the {{extended}} edition of The Two Towers, Jackson included an invented flashback scene showing that Denethor had neglected him {{in favour of}} Boromir when sending him to Rivendell, so that Faramir wanted to please his father by bringing him the Ring. (The relationship is similarly strained in the book, but his father's favouritism <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to affect his decisions in Ithilien.) Reviewers have opined that {{the extended}} edition presents Faramir in a more favourable light.|$|E
5|$|Segregation by sex {{and size}} <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to occur. Whitetips follow schools of tuna or squid, and trail groups of {{cetaceans}} such as dolphins and pilot whales, scavenging their prey. Their {{instinct is to}} follow baitfish migrations that accompany ocean-going ships. When whaling took place in warm waters, oceanic whitetips were often responsible {{for much of the}} damage to floating carcasses.|$|E
5|$|There is {{not much}} {{evidence}} that the chariot races were subject to bribes {{or other forms of}} cheating in the Roman Empire. In the Byzantine Empire, there seems to have been more cheating; Justinian I's reformed legal code prohibits drivers from placing curses on their opponents, but otherwise there <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to have been any mechanical tampering or bribery. Wearing the colours of one's team became an important aspect of Byzantine dress.|$|E

5|$|This {{indicates}} {{the existence of}} two groups: Lucius Gellius Publicola eventually attacked Crixus {{and a group of}} some 30,000 followers who are described as being separate from the main group under Spartacus. Plutarch describes the desire of some of the escaped slaves to plunder Italy, rather than escape over the Alps. While this factional split is not contradicted by classical sources, there <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to be any direct evidence to support it.|$|E
5|$|When Europeans first {{contacted}} Native Americans, some bows, {{especially in}} the area that became California, already had sinew backing. After the reintroduction of horses, newly mounted groups rapidly developed shorter bows, which were often given sinew backing. The full three-layer composite bow with horn, wood, and sinew <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to be recorded in the Americas, and horn bows with sinew backing are not recorded before European contact.|$|E
5|$|A {{large portion}} of the Persian army was trapped in its camp and slaughtered. The {{destruction}} of this army, and the remnants of the Persian navy allegedly on the same day at the Battle of Mycale, decisively ended the invasion. After Plataea and Mycale the Greek allies would take the offensive against the Persians, marking a new phase of the Greco-Persian Wars. Although Plataea was in every sense a resounding victory, it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to have been attributed the same significance (even at the time) as, for example, the Athenian victory at the Battle of Marathon or the Spartan defeat at Thermopylae.|$|E

5|$|Alternatively, stock {{abutments}} {{are used}} to retain dentures using a male-adapter attached to the implant and a female adapter in the denture. Two common types of adapters are the ball-and-socket style retainer and the button-style adapter. These types of stock abutments allow movement of the denture, but enough retention {{to improve the quality}} of life for denture wearers, compared to conventional dentures. Regardless of the type of adapter, the female portion of the adapter that is housed in the denture will require periodic replacement, however the number and adapter type <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to affect patient satisfaction with the prosthetic for various removable alternatives.|$|E
5|$|During John's {{persecution}} of William de Braose in 1209, William Marshal gave de Braose shelter on his Irish lands. De Gray demanded that Marshal surrender de Braose {{to him as}} a traitor, but Marshal refused, claiming that since he held some lands from de Braose, it would be an act of treason to surrender his lord to an outside authority. Marshal's refusal <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to have embittered de Gray however, as three years later the bishop was praising him in a letter to John.|$|E
5|$|In {{some parts}} of Iron Age Scotland, quite unlike almost all of {{recorded}} history {{right up to the}} present day, there <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to have been an hierarchical elite. Studies have shown that these stone roundhouses, with massively thick walls must have contained virtually the entire population of islands such as Barra and North Uist. Iron Age settlement patterns in Scotland are not homogenous, but in these places {{there is no sign of}} a privileged class living in large castles or forts, or of an elite priestly caste or of peasants with no access to the kind of accommodation enjoyed by the middle classes.|$|E
