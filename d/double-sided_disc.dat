50|$|Silvertone's discs were {{manufactured}} 1916-1928, {{and then}} revived briefly in 1940-1941.

50|$|The Region 1 DVD set of Season 1 {{was issued}} in non-anamorphic {{widescreen}} (meaning those with widescreen TVs {{would have to}} use the Zoom button for the show to fit their screen properly, causing the picture to be blurry) on 3 <b>double-sided</b> <b>discs.</b> However, Universal reissued the Season 1 set on February 10, 2009 in the correct anamorphic widescreen aspect ratio, which is now on 6 single-sided discs instead of the 3 double-sided ones.|$|R

5000|$|Laser rot is the {{appearance}} of video and audio artifacts during the playback of LaserDiscs, and their progressive worsening over time. It is most commonly attributed to oxidation in the aluminum layers by poor quality adhesives used to bond the disc halves together.

The name [...] "laser rot" [...] is a misnomer; the disc degradation does not involve the player's laser.|$|R
25|$|Universal Studios Home Entertainment has {{released}} all Miami Vice seasons on DVD for regions 1, 2, and 4. Seasons 1 & 2 were released in 2005, and seasons 3 through 5 were released in 2007. The DVD {{release of the}} series had been significantly slow due {{to one of the}} signature features of the show: the heavy integration of 1980s pop and rock music. The music was difficult to source the rights to and acquire permission to use. In the November 2004 announcement for the DVD release of the series, Universal promised that all original music in the series would be intact. On August 21, 2007 Universal announced the November 13, 2007 release of the complete series, with all five seasons on 27 single-sided DVDs. The seasons are in their own Digipak-style cases, and the set is housed in a faux alligator-skin package. Seasons 1 & 2 contained six single-sided discs, rather than the three <b>double-sided</b> <b>discs</b> in the initial release. The Region 2 version has different packaging, does not use <b>double-sided</b> <b>discs,</b> and although there are no special features stated on the packaging they are contained within the season 1 discs.|$|R
25|$|German {{record company}} Odeon {{is often said}} to have pioneered the album in 1909 when it {{released}} the Nutcracker Suite by Tchaikovsky on 4 <b>double-sided</b> <b>discs</b> in a specially designed package.

The practice of issuing albums {{does not seem to}} have been widely taken up by other record companies for many years; however, HMV provided an album, with a pictorial cover, for the 1917 recording of The Mikado (Gilbert & Sullivan).|$|R

50|$|According to Mathias Trentsensky, of {{art dealer}} and {{publishing}} company Trentsensky & Vieweg, Stampfer had prepared six double sided discs {{as early as}} February 1833 and had repeatedly demonstrated these to many friends. In April 1833 Trentsensky applied for an Austrian patent (k.k. Privilegium) together with Stampfer, which was granted on 7 May 1833. A first edition of the discs was soon published, but it sold out within four weeks and left them unable to ship orders. These discs probably had round holes as illustrated in an 1868 article and a 1922 reconstruction by William Day, but no original copies are known to still exist.Trentsensky & Vieweg published an improved and expanded set of eight <b>double-sided</b> <b>discs</b> with vertical slits in July 1833. English editions were published not much later with James Black and Joseph Myers & Co. A total of 28 different disc designs have been credited to Professor Stampfer.|$|R
