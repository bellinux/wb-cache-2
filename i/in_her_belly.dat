5|$|After {{restoring}} the Beanstar, Mario and Luigi travel to Joke's End {{to make the}} exchange, once again traveling through a maze filled with puzzles to be solved. Bowletta refuses to hand over Peach, but Luigi, disguised in Peach's spare dress, ends up being taken in Peach's stead. He escapes from the repaired Koopa Cruiser, reclaiming the Beanstar in the process. The brothers return to Beanbean Castle Town, finding it under attack by Bowletta using Bowser's flying castle. The brothers and Prince Peasley fly up to it to stop Cackletta. Mario and Luigi battle past the Koopalings, but before they can reach Bowletta the brothers encounter Fawful yet again. A fierce battle between the three ensues with the brothers coming out on top. But Fawful plays a dirty trick and attacks the brothers while they weren't paying attention. However, Prince Peasly comes in and send Fawful flying, seemingly defeating him. The Bros. finally confront Bowletta and another epic battle begins. Feigning defeat, she tricks the brothers and swallows them. After waking up <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>belly,</b> the brothers battle and defeat Cackletta's soul, exorcising her from Bowser's body. The two are regurgitated and Bowser returns to normal. Afterwards, the brothers escape the castle before it explodes from a bomb set by Peasley. The explosion sends the castle falling into the ocean. Exhausted from their vacation, Mario, Luigi, Peach and Toadsworth decide {{to head back to}} the Mushroom Kingdom. Before they can leave, Peasley brings a farewell gift for them to take home, which is Bowser, who regained his memory. The gang then returns home, and a movie based on their adventure is being shown at the Yoshi Theatre.|$|E
2500|$|Band member Ray Tabano {{wrote in}} Walk This Way that the {{abortion}} [...] "really messed Steven up" [...] because {{the child was}} a boy. Tyler wrote, [...] "It was a big crisis. It's a major thing when you're growing something with a woman, but they convinced us {{that it would never}} work out and would ruin our lives. You go to the doctor and they put the needle <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>belly</b> and they squeeze the stuff in and you watch. And it comes out dead. I was pretty devastated. In my mind, I'm going, Jesus, what have I done?" [...] However, Julia Holcomb has said that Tyler was snorting cocaine while watching the abortion and offered some to her.|$|E
2500|$|Nancy {{soon after}} becomes pregnant. Nancy begins helping her friend, Mitzeee (Rachel Shenton) who has escaped from prison. Mitzeee {{was in prison}} for the {{stabbing}} of Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe), Fox explained that Nancy has [...] "always known her friend was innocent" [...] as she knows that she is not capable of stabbing Mercedes. Nancy knows Mercedes has set Mitzeee up as she has threatened her on a couple of occasions, even saying [...] "something bad might happen to Nancy's baby if she doesn't get her nose out and that's made Nancy more determined". Fox said that Nancy's attitude towards Mitzeee's situation stems from when Becca was wrongly accused, sent to prison and murdered in jail which makes her [...] "really desperate to get this right for Mitzeee - to get her out and take Mercedes down!" [...] Explaining why Nancy and Mitzeee are such good friends, Fox said: [...] "They're such different people on the surface, but deep down Ann Minniver - Mitzeee's alter ego - is very moral, kind and caring and she's a very clever girl. I think those are all things that Nancy responds to and enjoys. Also, I think Mitzeee just makes Nancy laugh. Mitzeee can be a bit silly sometimes, and that makes Nancy smile". During the storyline, Nancy feuds with Mercedes. Fox said that Nancy has a bit of a [...] "bad girl" [...] in her which she shows during her confrontations with Mercedes, adding that the character has got [...] "more fire <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>belly</b> than maybe we'd realised".|$|E

"When the {{men came}} up the little one was perhaps rested, for {{it was able to}} turn round with its dam, no matter how quick she moved, so as to keep always <b>in</b> front of <b>her</b> <b>belly.</b> The five dogs were all the time frisking about her actively, tormenting her like so many gad-flies. Indeed they made it {{difficult}} to take an aim at her without killing them. But Hans, lying on his elbow, took a quiet aim, and shot her through the head. She dropped and rolled over dead, without moving a muscle.|$|R
50|$|In 2004, {{just after}} celebrating the shows 100th episode, Eddie Cibrian and Michael Beach left the show. Cibrians {{departure}} {{marked the first}} time a main character was written out of the show without dying. Series regular Molly Prices character, Faith Yokas, made very few appearances in season five of the series because Price was pregnant throughout much of the season. The writers for Third Watch explained her absence by her character being seriously injured in a shootout, and then trying to recuperate at home. In the few scenes Price was <b>in,</b> <b>her</b> growing <b>belly</b> was frequently hidden by blankets piled on top of her while she lay in bed. Cara Buono joined the cast as Paramedic Grace Foster late in the shows fifth season in 2004.|$|R

60|$|She {{was long}} in {{promising}} this part, {{but rather than}} not come at the main secret, she agreed to that too, and after a great many other preliminaries, I began, and told her the whole story. First I told her how much she was concerned in all the unhappy breach which had happened between her son and me, by telling me her own story and her London name; and that the surprise she saw I was in was upon that occasion. The I told her my own story, and my name, and assured her, by such other tokens as she could not deny, that I was no other, nor more or less, than her own child, her daughter, born of her body in Newgate; the same that had saved her from the gallows by being <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>belly,</b> and the same that she left in such-and-such hands when she was transported.|$|E
60|$|Both its {{motion and}} rest is very strange, and pleasant, and differing {{from those of}} most other creatures I have observ'd; for, where it ceases from moving its body, the tail of it seeming much lighter {{then the rest of}} its body, and a little lighter then the water it swims in, {{presently}} boys it {{up to the top of}} the water, where it hangs suspended with the head always downward; and like our Antipodes, if they do by a frisk get below that superficies, they presently ascend again unto it, if they cease moving, until they tread, as it were, under that superficies with their tails; the hanging of these in this posture, put me in mind of a certain creature I have seen in London, that was brought out of America, which would very firmly suspend it self by the tail, with the head downwards, and was said to keep in that posture, with <b>her</b> young ones <b>in</b> <b>her</b> false <b>belly,</b> which is a Purse, provided by Nature for the production, nutrition, and preservation of her young ones, which is described by Piso in the 24.
