40|$|Process Synthesis (PS) is a {{term used}} to {{describe}} a class of general and systematic methods for the conceptual design of processing plants and energy systems. The term also refers {{to the development of}} the process flowsheet (structure or topology), the selection of unit operations and the determination of the most important operating conditions. In this thesis an attempt is made to characterize some of the most common methodologies in a PS pyramid and discuss their advantages and disadvantages as well as where in the design phase they could be used most efficiently. The thesis shows how design tools have been developed for subambient processes by combining and expanding PS methods such as Heuristic Rules, sequential modular Process Simulations, Pinch Analysis, Exergy Analysis, Mathematical Programming using Deterministic Optimization methods and optimization using Stochastic Optimization methods. The most important contributions to the process design community are three new methodologies that include the pressure as an important variable in heat exchanger network synthesis (HENS). The methodologies have been used to develop a novel and efficient <b>energy</b> <b>chain</b> based on stranded natural gas including power production with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS). This Liquefied <b>Energy</b> <b>Chain</b> consists of an offshore process a combined gas carrier and an onshore process. This <b>energy</b> <b>chain</b> is capable of efficiently exploiting resources that cannot be utilized economically today with minor CO 2 emissions. Finally, a new Stochastic Optimization approach based on a Tabu Search (TS), the Nelder Mead method or Downhill Simplex Method (NMDS) and the sequential process simulator HYSYS is used to search for better solutions for the Liquefied <b>Energy</b> <b>Chain</b> with respect to minimum cost or maximum profit.

40|$|In 1998 ENSAD, {{a highly}} {{comprehensive}} database on severe accidents {{with emphasis on}} the energy sector, was established by the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI).

40|$|Transport {{makes up}} 20 {{percent of the}} World’s energy use; in OECD {{countries}} this has exceeded 30 percent. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that the global energy consumption will increase by 2. 1 percent annually, a growth rate that is higher than for any other sector. The high energy consumption means that transportation accounts for nearly 30 percent of CO 2 emission in OECD countries and {{is also one of}} the main sources of regional and local air pollution. In this article, we analyze energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions from passenger car transport using an <b>energy</b> <b>chain</b> analysis. The <b>energy</b> <b>chain</b> analysis consists of three parts: the net direct energy use, the energy required for vehicle propulsion; the gross direct chain, which includes the net direct energy consumption plus the energy required to produce it; and, finally, the indirect <b>energy</b> <b>chain,</b> which includes the energy consumption for production, maintenance and operation of infrastructure plus manufacturing of the vehicle itself. In addition to energy consumption, we also analyze emissions of greenhouse gases measured by CO 2 -equivalents. We look at the trade-offs between energy use and greenhouse gas emissions to see whether some drivetrains and fuels perform favourable on both indicators. Except for the case of electric cars, where hydropower is the only energy source in the Norwegian context, no single car scores favourably on both energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions...|$|E

40|$|The {{starting}} point of this dissertation is the observation that today {{a vast amount of}} 'PV powered' products are already on the market. However, in these PV powered products quite often the choice of PV cells seems random and PV cells function mostly as add-on units to give the product a 'green' energy image. Because of this 'add-on' approach, the PV cells remain foreign bodies which are not well-integrated into the total product design. As a result in today's PV powered products often a sub-optimal matching between the PV cell characteristics, energy storage and the product user contexts. Therefore, the keyword to obtain a mature and sustainably designed PV powered product will be matching. As a result the research question is formulated as: What systematic matching can be achieved between the elements and interfaces of the <b>energy</b> <b>chain</b> of photovoltaic powered mobile/wireless products? The emphasis of this dissertation will be on the optimal matching in the <b>energy</b> <b>chain</b> of PV powered products. For this purpose, an Energy Matching Model of the <b>energy</b> <b>chain</b> is developed. This dissertation will present how, why and under what circumstances a novel Energy Matching Model and associated Figure of Matching algorithm can support industrial designers in developing sustainable photovoltaic powered products. This PhD research project is executed {{within the framework of the}} SYN-Energy program which explores the feasibility of a transition towards the use of photovoltaic (PV) cells in consumer and professional products.

40|$|Production {{of solid}} fuels from wooden biomass is defined with {{appropriate}} <b>energy</b> <b>chain</b> of supply. Production procedure of solid fuels from wooden biomass, starting with technology for gathering wood residues and residues from logging {{up by the}} system of fuel production (system for milling, crushing, chopping, drying and pressing of wood residues), represents the <b>energy</b> <b>chain</b> of supply of solid fuel from biomass. Every single <b>energy</b> <b>chain</b> of supply and production of certain form of solid fuel from wooden biomass can be uniquely defined with three general criteria. These criteria are: energy efficiency of production, economy of production and environmental criteria. Efficiency of production is the relation of overall energy consumption per 1 kWh of heating value of produced fuel. When {{we talk about the}} economical aspect of production of solid fuels we take into account all production costs per 1 kWh of heating value of biofuel produced. Forest biomass is scattered and the need for its collection and transport require certain consumption of fossil fuel. Consumption of fossil fuel is needed to run mechanization to collect, transport and prepare biomass. Consumption of fossil fuels causes the emission of GHG. Ecological criteria for the estimation of production process of bio energy can be defined as emission of GHG per 1 kWh of heating value of produced fuel. Besides general criteria to estimate the quality of production of energy from biomass, there are specific criteria. Specific criteria regarding several characteristics are tightly related to applied technologies, potentials and barriers during the use of biomass. This paper analyzes only specific investment in selected chain of energy supply. The paper mathematically describes four characteristic cases of solid biofuel production from wooden biomass. These cases are: production of wooden chips from forest biomass with mobile chipper, production of wooden chips from wooden residues transported from sawmill to processing terminal, production of wooden briquette from mill residues transported into briquette factory, production of wooden pellet from mill residues transported into pellet factory. For overall ranking of <b>energy</b> <b>chain</b> of wooden biomass supply and selection of optimum variant, multicriteria optimization and VIKOR method is used...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} how the Danish biogas sector {{can achieve}} the political goals set {{out by the}} Danish government, in order to turn around the currently weak implementation of the technology.

The hydrogen economy concept, {{as set out in}} recent commissioned research investment policy advice documents, includes a range of hydrogen energy supply and consumption chains for transport and residential energy services. The benefits of research and development investments in these advice documents were not fully analyzed by cost or improvements in energy efficiency or green house gas emissions reduction. This paper sets out a straightforward method to quantify the system-level efficiency of these <b>energy</b> <b>chains.</b> The method was applied to transportation and stationary heat and power, with hydrogen generated from wind energy, natural gas and coal. The system-level efficiencies for the hydrogen chains were compared to direct use of conventionally generated electricity, and with internal combustion engines operating on gas- or coal-derived fuel. The hydrogen <b>energy</b> <b>chains</b> were shown to provide little or no system-level efficiency improvement over conventional technology.
