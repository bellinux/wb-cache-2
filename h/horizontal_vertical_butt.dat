In this paper, we provide a comparison of hardware reductions achieved using the <b>horizontal,</b> <b>vertical,</b> oblique and combining <b>horizontal</b> and <b>vertical</b> CSEs in realizing constant multipliers. Our FPGA implementation results included in 52 MCM examples show that three different (<b>horizontal,</b> <b>horizontal</b> and <b>vertical,</b> and efcient <b>horizontal</b> and <b>vertical)</b> CSEs have a good area-time product performance, in the MCM matrix range of 800 and over.

The {{probability}} {{distribution of the}} displacement vector in (19) is not circularly symmetric over given set of symbol pair x+ and x− thus the average error probability along the <b>horizontal</b> and <b>vertical</b> directions are not exactly the same. Therefore, both <b>horizontal</b> and <b>vertical</b> PAM error probabilities need to be evaluated. The individual error probabilities along both directions depend on the marginal densities. Next, the error probability on <b>horizontal</b> <b>vertical</b> PAM can be considered.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, an effcient skew {{estimation}} technique based on iterative employment of the Piece-wise Painting Algorithm (PPA) on document images is presented. The PPA is initially employed on the document image in both <b>horizontal</b> and <b>vertical</b> directions to obtain two horizontally and vertically painted images. A {{small number of}} <b>horizontal</b> (<b>vertical)</b> regions, called <b>horizontal</b> (<b>vertical)</b> bands, are then selected from the horizontally (vertically) painted images. Top (left), middle (middle) and bottom (right) points of the <b>horizontal</b> (<b>vertical)</b> bands are identified in 6 separate lists. A linear regression and a geometric line drawing method are applied on the selected points in each list, two fit lines are drawn. A voting approach based on statistical mode of angles obtained from the fit lines is also proposed to find the best- fit line amongst all the lines. Based on {{the slope of the}} best-fit line, the skew angle of the document image is finally estimated and the document skew is corrected. This process is iteratively applied until the estimated skew is less than 1 °. The proposed technique was tested extensively on three different datasets containing various categories of document images and encouraging results were obtained...|$|R
