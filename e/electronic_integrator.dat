40|$|This report {{outlines}} {{an experimental}} {{investigation into the}} mechanism of liquefaction. The investigation is centred {{on the relationship between}} the pore pressure build up in a sand sample, and the energy input to that sample by a cyclic load. Cyclic triaxial tests were used to establish the form, if any, of this relationship. A large portion of the duration of the experimental investigation was spent in developing a workable test procedure. The development continued with the construction of an <b>electronic</b> <b>integrator</b> specifically for the testing work. This device facilitated the recording of a plot of the pore pressure versus work input to the sample, continuously, throughout the duration of a test. A simple theory enabling prediction of the pore water pressure response to a given energy input at a known confining pressure is proposed. Comparison of the theoretical results with the measured traces for five analysed tests indicates that there is some merit to this description of the mechanism of the liquefaction of sands. The report concludes by emphasising this promise and suggesting that detailed future research along similar lines is needed...|$|E
40|$|With {{the advent}} of today’s precise {{analytical}} instruments it often becomes true that the scientist’s most time consuming fallible step {{in the evaluation of}} data is the converting of raw data into usable data. Gas chromatography is quite unique in this respect because of the several different methods employed to measure the area of a peak. The main differences between methods are cost, time, and precision. As far as the peak height, cut and weigh, planimetry and height x width at half-height methods are concerned their cost is minimal, but they are very tedious. Area measurement using a commercial <b>electronic</b> <b>integrator</b> or a computer system are highly accurate and fast but are usually not within the budgetary limitations of most departments. The relative merits and downfalls of different peak area methods can be summarized as follows: the peak height method, although not really an area measurement, is often used because of its simplicity and speed. This method is only valuable if column temperature, flow rate and type of gas are accurately controlled. The cut and weight method of cutting out the peaks, and weighing them is very time consuming and destroys the chromatogram...|$|E

The method is based on combining the two magnetic field principles of induction and torque. The apparatus includes a rotor assembly having a pair of inductive magnetic field pickup coils which are concentrically mounted, orthogonally oriented in the r and z directions, and coupled to remotely located electronics which include <b>electronic</b> <b>integrators</b> for determining magnetic field changes. The rotor assembly includes an axle oriented in the toroidal direction, with the axle mounted on pivot support brackets which in turn are mounted on a baseplate. First and second springs are located between the baseplate and the rotor assembly restricting rotation of the rotor assembly about its axle, the second spring providing a constant tensile preload in the first spring. A strain gauge is mounted on the first spring, and electronic means to continually monitor strain gauge resistance variations is provided. Electronic means for providing a known current pulse waveform to be periodically injected into each coil to create a time-varying torque on the rotor assembly in the toroidal direction causes mechanical strain variations proportional to the torque in the mounting means and springs so that strain gauge measurement of the variation provides periodic magnetic field measurements independent of the magnetic field measured by the <b>electronic</b> <b>integrators...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{electrochemical}} reduction of nicotinamide—adenine-dinucleotide (NAD+) and model compounds {{has been extensively}} studied 1 - 3; {{on the other hand}} very few papers have been published on the electrochemical oxidation of nicotinamide—adenine-dinucleotide reduced (NADH) in aqueous solution. Haas 4 reported the occurrence of an oxidation wave of NADH at pH 8. 6 at rotating platinum and glassy carbon disk electrodes (with respective half-wave potentials 0. 90 ± 0. 02 and 0. 67 ± 0. 03 V vs. NHE); macroscale electrolyses lead to NAD+ by a two-electron oxidation 4 ' 5. In this paper we shall present the features of the electrochemical oxidation of model compounds of NADH, namely Ni-benzyl-and NL-propyl-l, 4 -dihydronicotinamide (NBzNH and NPrNH) in aqueous solution, buffered within a large pH range; a possible mechanism is deduced from these data. Extensive studies have shown the occurrence of a "primary acid modification" of aqueous NADH solutions or its models below pH 7 (ref. 6); the common explanation put forward is a saturation of the 5 - 6 double bond in the pyridinic ring, the u. v. absorption band being shifted from 355 to 290 nm. Therefore the results and discussions presented here only concern the pH range 7 to 13. Experimental All products used were prepared in this laboratory, according to published methods, namely NBzNTP (ref. 7), NBzNH and NPrN+Br (ref. 8), NPrNH (ref. 9). The purity and concentration of the freshly prepared aqueous solutions were checked by u. v. spectrophotometry with a Cary 14 apparatus.
