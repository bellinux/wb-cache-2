40|$|This {{descriptive}} {{qualitative study}} examined perceived barriers {{to health care}} among Chuukese migrant women in Guam and explored which factors influenced <b>health-seeking</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Study participants recommended interventions which may reduce those perceived barriers. Since the Compact of Free Association with the United States was enacted in 1985, {{there has been a}} dramatic rise in the numbers of Chuukese migrating to Guam. This migration is anticipated to continue with more migrants needing health care, education, and social services. Little is known about their perceptions of barriers to health care services or the cultural, social, economic, and other factors that influence their <b>health-seeking</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Focus group interviews provided rich data, which were analyzed using content analysis. Themes included barriers to seeking and maintaining health and social and cultural factors influencing <b>health-seeking</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Major barriers identified were financial issues, difficulty in obtaining care due to long wait times, transportation problems, and struggles with both language and cultural nuances of communication. It was found that the women identified a mistrust of health and social services resulting from communication barriers. Social and cultural factors included the use of traditional Chuukese medicines, lack of preventive care services, confidentiality concerns, and feelings of mistreatment. Participants made recommendations for improved care and expressed a strong desire to achieve the mutual goal of better health care for Chuukese migrants in Guam...|$|R

It contributes in furthering the discussions on maternal <b>health-seeking</b> <b>behavior</b> and health outcomes from a health system perspective in sub-Saharan Africa. From a health system standpoint, the paper first presents the resources, organization and financing of maternal health service in Ghana, and later uses case study examples {{to explain how}} Ghana’s health system has shaped maternal <b>health-seeking</b> <b>behavior</b> {{of women in the}} district. The paper employs a qualitative case study technique to build a complex and holistic picture, and report detailed views of the women in their natural setting. A purposeful sampling technique is applied to select 16 women in the district for this study. Through face-to-face interviews and group discussions with the selected women, comprehensive and in-depth information on health- seeking behavior and health outcomes are elicited for the analysis. The study highlights that characteristics embedded in decentralization and provision of free maternal health care influence <b>health-seeking</b> <b>behavior.</b> Particularly, the use of antenatal care has increased after the delivery exemption policy in Ghana. Interestingly, the study also reveals certain social structures, which influence women’s attitude towards their decisions and choices of health facilities. </p...|$|E

40|$|The general <b>health-seeking</b> <b>behavior</b> {{has been}} well {{described}} in different populations. However, how different symptoms have driven <b>health-seeking</b> <b>behavior</b> was less explored. Compared with syndromic surveillance, symptom-specific behavior may more realistically reflect responses from the public. Moreover, the existing sources of syndromic surveillance data {{are affected by the}} choice of health service and health seeking behavior and hence may not be representative of actual disease burden. This study described <b>health-seeking</b> <b>behavior</b> of Hong Kong general population due to different symptoms, at different times of the year. By understanding <b>health-seeking</b> <b>behavior</b> at different times of the year, we could estimate the disease burden in the population, and population subgroup from multiple surveillance data. We will use influenza-like illness (ILI) as an example. We conducted 4 rounds of longitudinal randomized telephone surveys over 1. 5 year, to describe symptom-specific <b>health-seeking</b> <b>behavior</b> at times with different level of disease activity. We collected information if healthcare service was being sought for and types of medical consultation after onset of different symptoms. The information was further utilized to estimate the ILI burden in specific age groups. Fever is the symptom most likely to prompt people to seek medical attention. We further focused on ILI, defined as fever ≥ 37. 8 ℃ plus either cough or sore throat. There were 111 episodes of ILI in the study period. Of which, 85. 6 %, 6. 3 % and 18. 9 % visits GP, GOPC and CMP respectively (some have sought for multiple health service types), while 9 % did not seek for any medical attention. Based on the relation in the Methods, we estimated the weekly age-specific ILI burden over time from GP, GOPC and CMP surveillance. The estimated ILI burden for the population aged ≤ 15 and ≥ 55 years captured the peak in February-March in 2015 from surveillance of ILI institutional outbreaks (e. g. schools, elderly care centers). However, no such increased ILI burden was observed in the 16 - 54 years age group in the period. Syndromic surveillance data from different sources (e. g. medical consultation or google flu trends) were affected by different health seeking or reporting behavior.

We conducted a retrospective household survey to estimate mortality and describe <b>health-seeking</b> <b>behavior</b> in Western Area, Sierra Leone, between May 25, 2014, and February 16, 2015. We used two-stage cluster sampling, selected 30 geographical sectors with probability proportional to population size, and sampled 30 households per sector.

The sample comprised women (N[*]=[*] 35) who had married by 2012 while participating in a larger randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the effects of school support on HIV-related risk. The RCT sample was identified in 2007 as all female sixth graders in 25 rural eastern Zimbabwe primary schools whose parents, one or both, had died (N[*]=[*] 328). In our previous RCT analyses, we found that participants who affiliated with an Apostolic church were {{more than four times}} more likely to marry than those from non-Apostolic churches and that control group participants were twice as likely to marry as those in the intervention group. Other studies had found that marriage greatly increased the odds of HIV infection among adolescent women. Given the link between Apostolic affiliation and marriage, we conducted semi-structured interviews to explore type of marriage, reasons for marrying, church affiliation and attitudes, family planning, HIV testing, schooling, and family life. We were interested in differences, as perceived by our sample of young married women congregants, among Apostolic sects and other denominations in their attitudes about marriage and <b>health-seeking</b> <b>behaviors.</b> We were also interested in the influence of church affiliation on intervention participants’ decision to marry, since they had comprehensive school support and education is highly valued in Zimbabwe, but costly and often out of financial reach. Interviews were conducted from October 2012 through November 2013; data were analyzed using a general inductive approach. We found that pressure or perceived deception for coitus or marriage was reported only by intervention participants affiliated with Apostolic denominations. Other reasons for marriage were similar between Apostolic and non-Apostolic adherents, as well as intervention and control conditions. All participants believed HIV testing was important, but while all non-Apostolic denominations encouraged HIV testing and clinic/hospital care, there was considerable heterogeneity in attitudes among Apostolics, with ultraconservative denominations most likely to proscribe non-religious health care. We conclude that some, but not all, Apostolic-affiliated women are afforded discretion in their <b>health-seeking</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Since HIV screening and treatment depend on access to clinic/hospital care, continued public health efforts to engage Apostolic leaders is needed, along with monitoring of progress in access and outcomes...|$|R
