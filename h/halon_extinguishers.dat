40|$|Abstract. It is {{well known}} that halons are ozone-depleting {{substances}} and their release into the atmosphere has contributed in the last decades to the reduction in the ozone layer. In consequence to the Montreal Protocol, an international agreement designed to gradually eliminate the use of such substances, fire protection industry researchers faced the challenge of finding effective solutions to replace <b>halon</b> <b>extinguishers.</b> This research aims to provide a method to support the decision maker in the selection of the most suitable extinguisher substance for a specific application. According to such framework, a set of quantitative and qualitative criteria has been established in the decision-making problem. Such criteria have been properly regrouped in clusters in order to better evaluate their relative importance by means of AHP method and the criteria have been used for scoring the alternatives. The choice of an extinguisher substance rather than another has been subsequently carried out by means of a fuzzy TOPSIS approach, which reflects the vagueness of qualitative criteria...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSince {{the phase}} out of <b>Halon</b> <b>extinguishers</b> in the 1980 s, hot aerosol fire {{suppression}} technology has gained much attention. Unlike traditional inert gas, foam, water mist and Halon fire suppression agents, hot aerosol fire extinguishing agents {{do not need}} to be driven out by pressurized gases and can extinguish class A, B, C, D and K fires at 30 to 200 g/m 3. Generally, hot aerosol fire extinguishing technology has developed from a generation I oil tank suppression system to a generation III strontium salt based S-type system. S-type hot aerosol fire extinguishing technology greatly solves the corrosion problem of electrical devices and electronics compared to potassium salt based generation I & II hot aerosol fire extinguishing technology. As substitutes for Halon agents, the ODP and GWP values of hot fire extinguishing aerosols are nearly zero, but those fine aerosol particles can cause adverse health effects once inhaled by human. As for configurations of hot aerosol fire extinguishing devices, fixed or portable cylindrical canisters are the most common among generation II & III hot aerosol fire extinguishers across the world, while generation I hot aerosol fire suppression systems are integrated with the oil tank as a whole. Some countries like the U. S., Australia, Russia and China, etc. have already developed standards for manufacturing and quality control of hot aerosol fire extinguishing agents and norms for hot aerosol fire extinguishing system design under different fire protection scenarios. Coolants in hot aerosol fire suppression systems, which are responsible for reducing hot aerosol temperature to avoid secondary fire risk are reviewed for the first time. Cooling effects are generally achieved through vaporization and endothermic chemical decomposition of coolants. Finally, this review discussed areas applying generation I, II or III hot aerosol fire suppression technologies. The generation III hot aerosol fire extinguishing system is most applicable, especially in areas involving delicate electrical and electronic equipments. Nonetheless, developing a much cleaner, non-corrosive and highly efficient hot aerosol fire suppression system is still needed...|$|E
50|$|The Leopard 2 is {{equipped}} with a fire protection system. Four 9 kg <b>Halon</b> fire <b>extinguisher</b> bottles are installed on the right behind the driver's station. The bottles are connected to pipes and hoses and are activated automatically by the fire detection system, when temperatures rise above 82 C inside the fighting compartment, or manually via a control panel in the driver's compartment. An extra 2.5 kg <b>Halon</b> fire <b>extinguisher</b> is stored on the floor beneath the main gun.|$|R
25|$|In Australia, yellow (<b>Halon)</b> fire <b>extinguishers</b> {{are illegal}} to own or use on a fire, unless an {{essential}} use exemption has been granted, {{this is due}} to the ozone-depleting nature of halon.|$|R
50|$|The {{manufacture}} of UL Listed <b>halon</b> 1211 <b>extinguishers</b> {{was supposed to}} cease on October, 2009. The future listing is still in discussion. Halotron I is the replacement extinguishing agent. It takes a larger volume {{to get the same}} ratings as 1211 has.|$|R
50|$|On June 7, 2011, an {{electrical}} component in a switch gear room caused {{a small fire}} with <b>Halon</b> <b>extinguisher</b> activation which forced a partial evacuation. The fire was no longer burning when the on site fire brigade arrived and according to officials, the public was never in any danger. The fire impacted pumping of coolant water through the spent fuel pool. Cooling was interrupted for 90 minutes while the estimated time for the pool to reach boiling temperature was over 88 hours. In response, the Omaha Public Power District declared an alert (second level on a 4 level taxonomy). The evacuation was the first at the facility since 1992, when 20000 gal (ca. 76 t) of coolant leaked into a containment building from the reactor.|$|R
50|$|Halon gas - Rhino Halon fought at the 1997 U.S. Robot Wars {{event with}} a <b>halon</b> gas fire <b>extinguisher,</b> {{which was very}} {{effective}} at stopping internal combustion engines. Gas weapons of this nature were promptly prohibited from future competitions.|$|R
50|$|Large {{volumes of}} 1,1-dichloroethane are manufactured, with annual {{production}} exceeding 1 million {{pounds in the}} United States. It is mainly used as a feedstock in chemical synthesis, chiefly of 1,1,1-trichloroethane. It is also used as a solvent for plastics, oils and fats, as a degreaser, as a fumigant in insecticide sprays, in <b>halon</b> fire <b>extinguishers,</b> and in cementing of rubber. It is used in manufacturing of high-vacuum resistant rubber and for extraction of temperature-sensitive substances. Thermal cracking at 400-500 Â°C and 10 MPa yields vinyl chloride. In the past, 1,1-dichloroethane {{was used as a}} surgical inhalational anesthetic.|$|R
50|$|Perfluorobutane (PFB) is a colorless gas. It is {{a simple}} {{fluorocarbon}} with a n-butane skeleton and all the hydrogen atoms replaced with fluorine atoms. It {{is used as a}} replacement for <b>Halon</b> 1301 fire <b>extinguishers,</b> as well as the gas component for newer generation microbubble ultrasound contrast agents. Sonazoid is one such microbubble formulation developed by Amersham Health that uses perfluorobutane for the gas core.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, First Great Western (FGW) {{inherited}} the Wessex Trains fleet following {{the merger of}} the Great Western and Wessex franchises. FGW then swapped most of their former Wessex Trains Class 158s for former First TransPennine Express examples. This was so that FGW could have all Class 158 units that were owned by Porterbrook. During late 2007 and early 2008, the FGW Class 158 Express Sprinter fleet was refurbished. Improvements included: re-upholstery of seats, and repainting or replacement of interior fittings, alterations to interior lighting and total replacement of toilets. Additionally the windows have been replaced with safer laminated glass and <b>Halon</b> fire <b>extinguishers</b> replaced with foam ones. At {{the same time the}} units' engines were overhauled and the units repainted in FGW's own lilac and blue colours.|$|R
50|$|The Tooheys Top Ten runoff for pole {{position}} was notable for Peter Brock discharging his Ford Sierra's engine bay <b>Halon</b> gas fire <b>extinguisher</b> which was angled across the intercooler substantially boosting {{the power of}} the engine in the crucial drive up the mountain straight. As this was not technically against the rules the scrutineers did not find any misconduct, but the Entrants Association levied a $5000 fine on Brock for a moral infringement of the rules.|$|R
40|$|The Shuttle {{reinforces}} {{its policy}} of fire-preventive measures with onboard smoke detectors and <b>Halon</b> 1301 fire <b>extinguishers.</b> The forthcoming Space Station Freedom will have expanded fire protection with photoelectric smoke detectors, radiation flame detectors, and both fixed and portable carbon dioxide fire extinguishers. Many design and operational issues remain to be resolved for Freedom. In particular, the fire-suppression designs must consider the problems of gas leakage in toxic concentrations, alternative systems for single-failure redundancy, and commonality with the corresponding systems of the Freedom international partners. While physical and engineering requirements remain the primary driving forces for spacecraft fire-safety technology, there are, nevertheless, needs and opportunities {{for the application of}} microgravity combustion knowledge to improve and optimize the fire-protective systems...|$|R
40|$|A fine-water-mist fire-suppression device {{has been}} {{designed}} {{so that it can}} be discharged uniformly in any orientation via a high-pressure gas propellant. Standard fire extinguishers used while slightly tilted or on their side will not discharge all of their contents. Thanks to the new design, this extinguisher can be used in multiple environments such as aboard low-gravity spacecraft, airplanes, and aboard vehicles that may become overturned prior to or during a fire emergency. Research in recent years has shown that fine water mist can be an effective alternative to Halons now banned from manufacture. Currently, NASA uses carbon dioxide for fire suppression on the International Space Station (ISS) and <b>Halon</b> chemical <b>extinguishers</b> on the space shuttle. While each of these agents is effective, they have drawbacks. The toxicity of carbon dioxide requires that the crew don breathing apparatus when the extinguishers are deployed on the ISS, and Halon use in future spacecraft has been eliminated because of international protocols on substances that destroy atmospheric ozone. A major advantage to the new system on occupied spacecraft is that the discharged system is locally rechargeable. Since the only fluids used are water and nitrogen, the system can be recharged from stores of both carried aboard the ISS or spacecraft. The only support requirement would be a pump to fill the water and a compressor to pressurize the nitrogen propellant gas. This system uses a gaseous agent to pressurize the storage container as well as to assist in the generation of the fine water mist. The portable fire extinguisher hardware works like a standard fire extinguisher with a single storage container for the agents (water and nitrogen), a control valve assembly for manual actuation, and a discharge nozzle. The design implemented in the proof-of-concept experiment successfully extinguished both open fires and fires in baffled enclosures...|$|R
