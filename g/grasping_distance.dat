He gathered the largest masses of wood he could find and tied them together in bundles, until he had made something like a raft; but John was not a handy workman; his raft overturned the first time he tried it, and went to pieces, and he would have been drowned at that time if he had not been within <b>grasping</b> <b>distance</b> of the rocks. As it was, he got a fright which made him finally turn from that method of escape in despair.|$|E
40|$|Perceptual {{judgments}} of relative depth from binocular disparity are systematically distorted in humans, despite in principle {{having access to}} reliable 3 D information. Interestingly, these distortions vanish at a natural <b>grasping</b> <b>distance,</b> as if perceived stereo depth is contingent on a specific reference distance for depth-disparity scaling that corresponds {{to the length of}} our arm. Here we show that the brain’s representation of the arm indeed powerfully modulates depth perception, and that this internal calibration can be quickly updated. We used a classic visuomotor adaptation task in which subjects execute reaching movements with the visual feedback of their reaching finger displaced farther in depth, as if they had a longer arm. After adaptation, 3 D perception changed dramatically, and became accurate at the “new” natural <b>grasping</b> <b>distance,</b> the updated disparity scaling reference distance. We further tested whether the rapid adaptive changes were restricted to the visual modality or were characteristic of sensory systems in general. Remarkably, we found an improvement in tactile discrimination consistent with a magnified internal image of the arm. This suggests that the brain integrates sensory signals with information about arm length, and quickly adapts to an artificially updated body structure. These adaptive processes are most likely a relic of the mechanisms needed to optimally correct for changes in size and shape of the body during ontogenesis...|$|E
40|$|The human {{visual system}} shows a {{relatively}} greater response to low spatial frequencies of chromatic spatial modulation than to luminance spatial modulation [1]. However, previous work [2, 3] {{has shown that}} this differential sensitivity to low spatial frequencies is not reflected in any differential luminance and chromatic content of general natural scenes. This {{is contrary to the}} prevailing assumption that the spatial properties of human vision ought to reflect the structure of natural scenes [4 – 6]. Now, colorimetric measures of scenes suggest that red-green (and perhaps blue-yellow) color discrimination in primates is particularly suited to the encoding of specific scenes: reddish or yellowish objects on a background of leaves [7 – 10]. We therefore ask whether the spatial, as well as chromatic, properties of such scenes are matched to the different spatial-encoding properties of color and luminance modulation in human vision. We show that the spatiochromatic properties of a wide class of scenes, which contain reddish objects (e. g., fruit) on a background of leaves, correspond well to the properties of the red-green (but not blue-yellow) systems in human vision, at viewing distances commensurate with typical <b>grasping</b> <b>distance.</b> This implies that the red-green system is particularly suited to encoding both the spatial and the chromatic structure of such scenes...|$|E

40|$|Trichromatic {{primates}} have a ‘red-green ’ chromatic {{channel in}} addition to luminance and ‘blue-yellow ’ channels. It {{has been argued that}} the red-green channel evolved in primates as an adaptation for detecting reddish or yellowish objects, such as ripe fruits, against a background of foliage. However, foraging advantages to trichromatic primates remain unverified by behavioral observation of primates in their natural habitats. New World monkeys (platyrrhines) are an excellent model for this evaluation because of the highly polymorphic nature of their color vision due to allelic variation of the L-M opsin gene on the X chromosome. In this study we carried out field observations of a group of wild, frugivorous black-handed spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi frontatus, Gray 1842, Platyrrhini), consisting of both dichromats (n = 12) and trichromats (n = 9) in Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica. We determined the color vision types of individuals in this group by genotyping their L-M opsin and measured foraging efficiency of each individual for fruits located at a <b>grasping</b> <b>distance.</b> Contrary to the predicted advantage for trichromats, {{there was no significant difference}} between dichromats and trichromats in foraging efficiency and we found that the luminance contrast was the main determinant of the variation of foraging efficiency among red-green, blue-yellow and luminance contrasts. Our results suggest that luminance contrast can serve as an important cue in short-range foraging attempts despite other sensory cues that could be available. Additionally, the advantage of red-green color vision in primates may not be as salient as previously thought and needs to be evaluated i...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{has suggested that}} perceived distances are scaled by the action capabilities of the body. The present studies showed that when "reachability" is constrained due to a difficult grasp required to pick up an object, perceived distance to the object increases. Participants estimated the distances to tools with handle orientations that made them either easy or difficult to grasp with their dominant and nondominant hands. Right-handed participants perceived tools that were more difficult to grasp to be farther away than tools that were easier to <b>grasp.</b> However, perceived <b>distance</b> did not differ in left-handed participants. These studies suggest that, when reaching toward a target, the distance to that target is scaled in terms of how far one can effectively reach, given the type of reaching posture that is executed.

40|$|Most {{timeline}} analogies of geologic {{and evolutionary}} time are fundamentally flawed.

Thus most timeline analogies are flawed by either overcompressing an experienceable time or relying on an unexperienceable distance. Under the constraint of experienceability, the best timeline to distance scale must be at least 75 miles and no more than about 500 miles long. Using Google Earth, one can construct such ideal timeline analogies relative to a point in the classroom with locally adaptable markers for important events in geologic time. I have used these analogies for several years in university and public lectures to great effect. <br/...|$|R

However, 5 - to 6 -year-old children did not increase grip aperture with increased distance, whereas older children and adults did. The older children and adults spent longer after peak deceleration when they {{could not see the}} hand, and maximum grip aperture (MGA) was larger, providing an increased safety margin. Children aged 5 to 6 spent {{the same amount of time}} between peak deceleration and grasp, whether or not they could see the hand, and they failed to increase MGA when they could not see the hand.

40|$|Mice are adept {{in the use}} {{of their}} hands for {{activities}} such as feeding, which has led to their use in investigations of the neural basis of skilled-movements. We describe the syntactic organization of pasta-eating and the structure of hand movements used for pasta manipulation by the head-fixed mouse. An ethogram of mice consuming pieces of spaghetti reveals that they eat in bite/chew bouts. A bout begins with pasta lifted to the mouth and then manipulated with hand movements into a preferred orientation for biting. Manipulation involves many hand release-reach movements, each with a similar structure. A hand is advanced from a digit closed and flexed (collect) position to a digit extended and open position (overgrasp) and then to a digit closed and flexed (<b>grasp)</b> position. Reach <b>distance,</b> hand shaping, and grasp patterns featuring precision grasps or whole hand grasps are related. To bite, mice display hand preference and asymmetric grasps; one hand (guide grasp) directs food into the mouth and the other stabilizes the pasta for biting. When chewing after biting, the hands hold the pasta in a symmetric resting position. Pasta-eating is organized and features structured hand movements and so lends itself to the neural investigation of skilled-movements. © 2017 The Author(s) ...|$|R

While some of the other authors may have a better in-depth <b>grasp</b> of <b>distance</b> education opportunities and realities in Nebraska, Erik and I come as native Nebraskans with a good understanding of the history, economy, communities and cultures in our home state. My early faculty career here at UNL included producing thousands of radio and television programs in home economics and agricultural areas including a weekly educational television program in consumer affairs. I spent approximately 20 years of my career outside Nebraska in the U. S. Department of Agriculture in international training and development positions and as head of Communication, Information and Technology for the USDA Extension Service. Six of those 20 years were spent in Tanzania, East Africa, establishing a large human resource development program. My academic degrees are in journalism, nutrition and adult and continuing education - all from UNL. My current position as president of the ADEC distance education consortium which includes approximately 55 state university and land grant college members provides a unique perspective on the field of distance education locally, nationally and internationally. Erik France, who is assisting me in this work, is a journalism and business graduate from UNL and is currently doing his masters degree in the Department of Agricultural Leadership, Education and Communication. Erik conducted a series of Nebraska interviews related to the issues we were asked to cover. I also think he provides a youthful, up and coming perspective that is important for us to hear. We also consider this paper to be a draft, a document to stimulate those of you attending this conference and others who may want to contribute ideas following this conference on our ADEC website. We posted the paper to the website - [URL] and would welcome additional insights that will assist us in completing the document by November 15. We have chosen to organize the document around five propositions - for each of these, I will provide rationale and discussion material, Erik will then provide perspectives from his interviews that relate and then we will ask for reactions from those of you in this room...|$|R
40|$|Repentance and overcoming, or {{becoming}} an available, usable memory and an activity of resistance: this, {{in an environment}} of critical communicative practices, is what the experience of the Gulag and later, nomenklatura embodiments of the Soviet system might have become in our day. The problem of the functions of various types of repentance is discussed in the article, following the ideas of Arendt, Foucault, Habermas, and Podoroga and interpreting repentance as a technology of power. Two types of repentance are considered: Christian and Dissident. The first is based on classical rituals, repetition, and a regime of confession, repentance, redemption, and the maintenance of a new status. Institutionalization and control of confessions as well as internalization of technologies and transcending of authority created a technology of internal self-control. The Christian technologies of confession and repentance were developed in the contemporary system of prisons and collective power (the phenomenon of collective trials in Soviet Union). The main purpose of Christian, prison and collective repentances is full renunciation of previous beliefs and establishment of a new trust. Religious and consequently ideological confessions and repentances are based on new beliefs and full destruction and deformation of the previous ones. The dissident movement developed another type of a repentance, which is based on the dialectical idea of overcoming (Aufheben) and was applied to the case of the Gulag. The procedure of overcoming presupposes understanding of moral or psychic problems in the case of terror and pressure, development of critical <b>distance,</b> <b>grasping</b> of transformations of humanity, subjection of negative experience, and transforming it into a disposition. Contemporary awareness of Gulag experiences and of later nomenklatura systems could start to be a spiritual repentance or a dialectic overcoming of existing memory. This article pays attention mainly to the Russian case; however, some conclusions could be applied to all post-Soviet experiences. The urgency of the article is based on the stopping of the repentance memory or critical inquiry of totalitarian persecution of people and revelation a neo-Stalinist imagination in contemporary style. The article compares two traumatic “afters”: “after-Auschwitz” and “after-Gulag. ” Principal attention is paid to the influence of Holocaust and Stalinist systems of repression. The first is called a mechanical rationality, which presupposes systematic extermination of people; and the second, the Gulag, is called an organic system of subduing and correcting human beings. The organic system presupposes that everybody could be “participants” of the Gulag, as prosecutors and convicts could take each others’ places. The analysis of the Gulag was done mainly {{on the basis of the}} works of Solzhenitsyn and Shalamov, who present mostly repentance through overcoming. They show how terrible and inhuman was the memory of the maximum moral turpitude reached even by some of the survivors. The article also analyzes Tengiz Abuladze’s film Repentance (1984). The movie became a symbol of Perestroika and was seen by millions of Soviet people after 1986, including both official ideologists of Perestroika and dissidents, who supported it equally. The film marked a turning point from the economic concept of socialist Perestroika to a spiritual revelation of forgiveness. The film compares two approaches to the memory of authoritarian crimes: that of the nomenklatura and that of the descendants of victims. The discourse of repentance is acceptable mainly to former victims, but not to some of the descendants of the persecutors nor to the nomenklatura. The film features many deep religious, surrealistic, and inter-textual historical symbols. The article considers the destiny of Abuladze’s film and the repentance of the Gulag perpetrators. After the Soviet Union’s destruction, the international Memorial organization devoted their activity to the unmasking of the Big Terror and Communist crimes. For them, confessions, repentances, transformations of persons, critical overcoming of Gulag experiences were very important parts of the discussion; and cooperation with former dissidents started to become everyday practice. However, after 2000 they came under the strong control and censure of a new pro-Putin power. In consequence, restoration of Stalinist symbols and nostalgia about beautiful Soviet times became dominant. The article analyzes Old Songs about What’s Most Important, a project of the Russian TV Company ORT TV and devoted to the most popular songs of the period from 1940 to 1982, i. e., the era of Stalinism and nomenklatura stagnation. The same period was criticized in Abuladze’s film Repentance. Old Songs about What’s Most Important does without any references to the Gulag, dissident songs, and unpleasant memories. However, the article argues that it is simulacrum Stalinism and more of a commercial project, in tandem with the coming to power of Putin. Old Songs about What’s Most Important expressed the symptom of forgetting that befell a majority of Russian speakers throughout the territory of the former Soviet UnionAtgaila ir įveikimas (vok. Aufhebung), virtimas disponuojama atmintimi bei rezistenciniu aktyvumu įvairių kritiškų komunikacinių praktikų aplinkoje, štai kuo galėjo tapti Gulago ir vėlesnės nomenklatūrinės sovietinės sistemos patirtis mūsų dienomis. Tačiau kažkokiu istoriniu momentu šis subjekto išsilaisvinimo ir naujų socialinių santykių kūrimo procesas sustojo, o asmenys patyrę Stalino represijas ar jų palikuonys ne priešinosi, o patys, jau atrodo laimėję, nuolankiai užleido vietą restauraciniams procesams: nomenklatūros, autoritarizmo ir Gulago šmėklų atgimimui. Naujoji įsivaizduojama Rusijos, o iš dalies ir Baltarusijos istorija pavertė represijų ir masinių trėmimų, teroro organizatorius naujaisiais romantizuojamais herojais, kuriuos ėmė šlovinti net kai kurie tremtinių palikuonys. Kaltė, kuri buvo adresuojama Gulago prižiūrėtojams, buvo užmiršta, ir dabar jau aukų palikuonys įvardija savo tėvus, senelius ar prosenelius kaltaisiais. Bet jie ir yra kalti – tik dėl ko kito: kad nesipriešino, tylėjo beveik iki mirties [...] . Pasyvumas, baimė, nuolatinis susitaikymas, veikiausiai atkeliavęs dar iš baudžiavos ar beteisių gamyklos darbininkų laikų, virto tuo, kad tremtinių vaikai užaugo panašiais, kokie buvo ir jie jaunystėje, leidę Stalino, Hitlerio ar kitiems autoritariniams režimams laimėti. Todėl istorija kartojasi: ir ne kaip farsas, o kaip nauja falsifikuota tragedija, tik jau ne socializmo, o reklaminio autoritarizmo šviesoje. Falsifikuota, nes nebėra nei Gulago, nei sovietinės nomenklatūros, o centralizuotas oligarchinis kapitalizmas Rusijoje, naujasis autoritarizmas ir neketina atkurti buvusio totalinio teroro, o tik jį imituoti, vaidinti. Tokioje aplinkoje ne didžioji tragedija ir kūryba, taip žavėjusi romantikus, o tragedijos fikcija ir scena tampa svarbiausios. Būtent jie kuria klaidingą atmintį ir vartojamus vaizdus, kurie pašalina ir pakeičia dramatišką išpažintį ir atmintį apie stalinizmo ir vėlesnio nomenklatūrinio laikotarpio metus. Koks yra tas moderniosios visuomenės susvetimėjimas, vartotojiškas abejingumas, rezistencijos ir pilietinio solidarumo nebuvimas, kuris leidžia atkurti ir falsifikuoti didžiuosius sielų etapus? Straipsnyje ketinama apsvarstyti filosofinę Aušvico atminties patirtį, palyginti ją su disidentiniais svarstymais apie Gulagą, įvertinti dvi egzistenciškai svarbias atgailos technologijas: krikščionišką ir negatyvią dialektinę, apsvarstyti Tengizo Abuladze’s filmo „Atgaila“ turinį ir filmo likimą tuo metu, kai glamūrinis filmų projektas „Senosios dainos apie svarbiausia“ užgožė tragiškos atminties galimybę. Straipsnyje daugiausia analizuojama sovietinė ir Rusijos patirtis, kuri Lietuvos tikrovę veikia nuolatos, tačiau yra svetimkūnis...|$|R
