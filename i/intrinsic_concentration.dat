In eukaryotes, the PAP driven reaction is the committed step in the synthesis of triacylglycerol (TAG). Existing methods for measuring PAP activity rely {{on the use of}} radioactive PtdOH. These methods are costly and cumbersome. In this report, we describe a simple assay procedure to measure released inorganic orthophosphate, which is a coproduct of the PAP reaction. Each molecule of PtdOH would release one molecule of DAG and one molecule of inorganic orthophosphate (Pi) when subjected to enzymatic breakdown under optimal conditions. Given the published rates of in vitro PAP enzymatic activity from various sources, we proposed that colorimetric determination of released Pi is possible. With this view, we performed in vitro PAP activity assays using freshly isolated enzyme from bitter gourd, Momordica charantia, and measured the released Pi using two spectrophotometric methods. Both methods gave about 2. 0 to 2. 25 ηkat per mg of protein.

40|$|Abstract ApoC-III and apoE are {{important}} determinants of intravascular lipolysis and clearance of triglyceride-rich chylomicrons and VLDL {{from the blood}} plasma. Interactions of these two apolipoproteins were studied by adding purified human apoC-III to human plasma at levels observed in hypertriglyceridemic subjects and incubating under specific conditions (2 h, 37 �C). As plasma concentrations of apoC-III protein were increased, the contents in both VLDL and HDL were also increased. Addition of apoC-III at concentrations up to four times the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>concentration</b> resulted in the decreasing incremental binding of apoC-III to VLDL while HDL bound increasing amounts without evidence of saturation. No changes were found in lipid content or in particle size of any lipoprotein in these experiments. However, distribution of the intrinsic apoE in different lipoprotein particles changed markedly with displacement of apoE from VLDL to HDL. The fraction of VLDL apoE that was displaced from VLDL to HDL at these high apoC-III concentrations varied among individuals from 20 % to 100 % its intrinsic level. The proportion of VLDL apoE that was tightly bound (0 % to 80 %) {{was found to be}} reproducible and to correlate with several indices of VLDL particle size. In the group of subjects studied, strongly adherent apoE was essentially absent from VLDL particles having an average content of less than 50, 000 molecules of triglyceride.

40|$|Quantification of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) {{concentration}} using localized MRS {{suffers from}} partial volume effects related {{to differences in}} the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>concentration</b> of GABA in grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM). These differences can be represented as a ratio between intrinsic GABA in GM and WM, rM. Individual differences in GM tissue volume can therefore potentially drive apparent concentration differences. Here, a quantification method that corrects for these effects is formulated and empirically validated. Quantification using tissue water as an internal concentration reference has previously been described. Partial volume effects attributed to rM can {{be accounted for by}} incorporating into this established method an additional multiplicative correction factor based on measured or literature values of rM weighted by the proportion of GM and WM within tissue-segmented MRS volumes. Simulations were performed to test the sensitivity of this correction using different assumptions of rM taken from previous studies. The tissue correction method was then validated by applying it to an independent dataset of in vivo GABA measurements using an empirically measured value of rM. It is shown that incorrect assumptions of rM can lead to overcorrection and inflation of GABA concentration measurements quantified in volumes composed predominantly of WM. For the independent dataset, GABA concentration was linearly related to GM tissue volume when only the water signal was corrected for partial volume effects. Performing a full correction that additionally accounts for partial volume effects ascribed to rM successfully removed this dependency. With appropriate assumption of the ratio of intrinsic GABA concentration in GM and WM, GABA measurements can be corrected for partial volume effects, potentially leading to a reduction in between-participant variance, increased power in statistical tests and better discriminability of true effects...|$|E

30|$|We {{have shown}} that the Drude-Lorentz model {{describes}} the optical properties of III-V semiconductors well. The THz-TDS and FTIR are suitable techniques for exploring properties of semiconductors in their respective ranges. The doping or <b>intrinsic</b> <b>concentrations</b> of free carriers in the measured ranges lead to a metal-like behavior. A surface plasmon polariton guided by these materials exhibits reasonable confinement and propagation length, similar to SPPs on noble metal-dielectric interface in the visible range. Thus semiconductors are suitable for the surface plasmon applications in the terahertz and far IR regime. An interesting property emerges with an applied magnetic field - a large anisotropy is induced, causing a huge magneto-optical effect. That can be used to significantly modulate the optical and guided wave properties using small magnetic field at room temperature. Free carrier magneto-optical effect is extremely weak in metals, due to their large plasma frequency and high effective mass and thus low cyclotron frequency. Coupled with low confinement of surface waves for THz frequencies in metals make semiconductors much more suitable for terahertz plasmonics.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{describe}} diffusive transport of solutes through a porous material, estimation of effective diffusion coefficients is required. It {{has been shown}} theoretically {{that in the case}} of uncharged porous materials the effective diffusion coefficient of solutes is a function of the pore morphology of the material and can be described by the tortuosity (tensor) (Bear, 1988 [1]). Given detailed information of the pore geometry at the micro-scale the tortuosity of different materials can be accurately estimated using homogenization procedures. However, many engineering materials (e. g., clays and shales) are characterized by electrical surface charges on particles of the porous material which strongly affect the (diffusive) transport properties of ions. For these type of materials, estimation of effective diffusion coefficients have been mostly based on phenomenological equations with no link to underlying micro-scale properties of these charged materials although a few recent studies have used alternative methods to obtain the diffusion parameters (Jougnot et al., 2009; Pivonka et al., 2009; Revil and Linde, 2006 [2 - 4]). In this paper we employ a recently proposed up-scaled Poisson-Nernst-Planck type of equation (PNP) and its micro-scale counterpart to estimate effective ion diffusion coefficients in thin charged membranes. We investigate a variety of different pore geometries together with different surface charges on particles. Here, we show that independent of the charges on particles, a (generalized) tortuosity factor can be identified as function of the pore morphology only using the new PNP model. On the other hand, all electro-static interactions of ions and charges on particles can consistently be captured by the ratio of average concentration to effective <b>intrinsic</b> <b>concentration</b> in the macroscopic PNP equations. Using this formulation allows to consistently take into account electrochemical interactions of ions and charges on particles and so excludes any ambiguity generally encountered in phenomenological equations...|$|E
40|$|Die Realstruktur des perowskitischen Modellsystems SrTiO 3, welches in der Raumgruppe Pm- 3 m kristallisiert, wird durch die Sauerstoffvakanz als wichtigstem Defekt dominiert. Durch Temperaturbehandlung unter reduzierenden Bedingungen können Sauerstoffvakanzen in die Kristallstruktur eingebracht werden. Aufgrund ihrer positiven Ladung relativ zum Kristallgitter bewegen sie sich im elektrischen Feld entlang des TiO 6 -Oktaedernetzwerkes. Die Elektroformierung folgt dabei einem Arrheniuszusammenhang, wobei sowohl die Aktivierungsenergie als auch die Mobilität eine deutliche Abhängigkeit von der Kristallorientierung zeigen. Die Umverteilung der Sauerstoffvakanzen führt zu lokalen reversiblen Strukturänderungen, welche die Ausbildung einer neuen migrationsinduzierten feldstabilisierten polaren (MFP) Phase verursachen. In Abhängigkeit von der elektrischen Feldstärke zeichnet sie sich strukturell durch eine tetragonale Verzerrung der ursprünglich kubischen Elementarzelle aus und geht mit dem Verlust der Inversionssymmetrie einher. Die Polarisation in der Struktur wird durch die erwiesene Pyroelektrizität bestätigt und gilt als Grundlage, um anhand eines kristallographischen Symmetrieabstieges die Herleitung der Raumgruppe P 4 mm zu ermöglichen. Der durch die Migration hervorgerufene intrinsische Defektkonzentrationsgradient ruft eine elektromotorische Kraft hervor, deren Verwendung in einem elektrochemischen Energiespeicher experimentell nachgewiesen wurde. Diese neuen Funktionalitäten sind durch die Anwendung defektchemischer und kristallphysikalischer Konzepte infolge gezielter Materialmodifizierung unter Einfluss von Temperatur und elektrischem Feld zu verstehen. The real {{structure}} of the perovskite-type model system SrTiO 3, crystallizing in space group Pm- 3 m, is dominated by oxygen vacancies as most important defects. They are introduced in the crystal structure through heat-treatment under reducing conditions. Because of their positive charge relative to the crystal lattice, oxygen vacancies move in an electric field along the TiO 6 octahedron network. This electroformation process follows an Arrhenius behavior. Both the activation energy and the mobility show an obvious dependence on the crystal orientation. Redistribution of oxygen defects causes local reversible structural changes, which involve {{the formation of a}} migration-induced field-stabilized polar (MFP) phase. In dependence on the electric field strength, this is structurally marked by a tetragonal distortion of the original cubic unit cell and accompanied by a loss of inversion symmetry. The polarisation in the crystal structure is confirmed by the proven pyroelectricity and serves for the argumentation to derive the space group P 4 mm by means of a crystallographic symmetry descent. The migration-induced <b>intrinsic</b> <b>concentration</b> gradient of oxygen vacancies leads to an electromotive force, whose application as electrochemical energy storage was proven experimentally.

40|$|Piezoelectric {{materials}} are currently {{widely used in}} both electronics and transducer applications. Today, {{the majority of these}} units are based on the lead containing material system PZT, and release of lead to the environment during synthesis or through waste is a challenge. Lately, much research has been done into alternative lead-free materials. One of the promising alternatives is bismuth ferrite, BiFeO 3 (BFO), which shows high polarization, Curie temperature and strain response, as well as being multiferroic at room temperature. However, the properties are not easily utilized due to high conductivity, yielding leakage currents when external fields in the order of the coercive field are applied. The too high conductivity appear to originate form p-type conduction, with localized holes, or polarons, on the iron sub lattice. Iron is able to contain several valence states, where Fe^(3 +) is default in BFO. Oxidation to Fe^(4 +) corresponds to a hole on the iron site, yielding p-type conduction, while reduction to Fe^(2 +) corresponds to an electron, yielding n-type conduction. The origin of the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>concentration</b> of holes is argued to be evaporation of bismuth oxide during synthesis, causing bismuth and oxygen vacancies. Oxygen vacancies will then create an equilibrium with holes, in accordance with 2 Fe^(3 +) + 0. 5 O 2 (g) -> 2 Fe^(4 +) +O^(2 -). Le Chatelier's principle then states that an increase of oxygen vacancy concentration should also cause an increase in concentration of holes, yielding an increase in conductivity. Synthesis of phase pure samples of BFO has also proven to be a challenge. Sillenite and mullite are commonly observed parasitic secondary phases, and bismuth potassium titanate is here solved in BFO in order to avoid these phases. Potassium and titanium stabilize the perovskittic phase, and synthesis of 0. 8 BFO- 0. 2 BKT (BKTF- 80) does not show the same parasitic decomposition. The promising features of BFO are not strongly affected by this composition change, however. It is here investigated which effect variation of A to B stoichiometry has on conductivity and phase purity of BKTF- 80. To do this, samples are prepared where A cation oxides are (1) added for 1 and 2 % A excess, and (2) removed for 1 and 3 % A deficiency, in addition to (3) the stoichiometric sample. This corresponds to (Bi 0. 9 K 0. 1) 1 +x(Fe 0. 8 Ti 0. 2) O 3, where x=- 0. 03,- 0. 01, 0, 0. 01, 0. 02. It is expected that this will cause B vacancies for A excess, and A vacancies for A deficiency, and that these in both cases are balanced by oxygen vacancies. That is, the concentration of oxygen vacancies will be lowest where A excess corresponds to evaporation, and increase with deviation in either direction. The conductivity is assumed to follow the same development. Obtained results show that the perovskite phase is not able to accommodate the variation of A to B stoichiometry, but rather secondary phases are formed. Consequently, the expected conductivity development is not observed. To the contrary, conductivity is shown to be lowest for A deficient samples, increasing as stoichiometry is varied toward A excess. This is argued to originate in part from titanium doping, when excess titanium is solved in the perovskite, as opposed to excess iron, which forms a secondary phase. However, the variation in conductivity is so large that other effects are suspected to also play a part. Further work primarily constitutes investigation of the influence of atmospheric history, as differences due to variations in reducing conditions may help identify the source of conduction. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{incorporation}} of intrinsic point defects into a growing crystal and their subsequent agglomeration into larger defects {{are controlled by}} the solidification and subsequent cooling process. The evolution of intrinsic point defects in Silicon can generally be described by a system of reaction-diffusion equations for the concentration of selfinterstitials and vacancies. The main difficulty in quantitative intrinsic point defect prediction with such an approach is {{the uncertainty of the}} temperature-dependent material properties. These properties are generally unknown. This is due to the difficulty to measure them experimentally at high temperatures. To circumvent this problem these properties can be computed by an underlying microscopic model by means of molecular dynamics simulations. A potential due to Stillinger and Weber or, alternatively, a many-body potential due to Tersoff is applied for this purpose.

40|$|Murine {{alpha-fetoprotein}} (alphaFP) {{has been}} shown to suppress T cell-dependent antibody responses in vitro but not T cell-independent responses. Our earlier preliminary findings indicated that such inhibitory effects are mediated via activated T cells. In this study, using alphaFP as the inducing agent, we have analyzed cells generated in vitro from adult spleen cells with regard to function and surface markers and compared the cells to the naturally occurring splenic T cells of newborn mice, in which there are high <b>intrinsic</b> <b>concentrations</b> of alphaFP. Both types of T lymphocytes were found to effectively inhibit T cell-dependent antibody responses in vitro but not T cell-independent responses. Moreover, both groups of T cells were found to express the identical differentiation antigen phenotype,Ly 1 + 2 -. Thus alphaFP-induced inhibitory T cells from adults could be shown to have the same functional properties and Ly phenotype as splenic T lymphocytes from newborn mice. These findings support the concept that alphaFP might function as an important immunoregulatory agent in vivo during ontogenetic development...|$|R
