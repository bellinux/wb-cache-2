Even {{in cases of}} complete wetting, where the spreading power S is positive and where an equivalent liquid would spread, the <b>elastic</b> <b>stresses</b> due to the gel deformation upon adsorption oppose spreading. The competition between elasticity characterized by the bulk shear modulus G and capillarity, characterized by the spreading power S, defines a typical length scale 1 = S/G for the deformation in the gel.

40|$|Obviously, {{the effect}} of <b>elastic</b> <b>stresses</b> in solid-solid {{transitions}} is of particular interest.

Speci?cally, the distinct <b>elastic</b> <b>stresses</b> induce selection of steady-state solutions where the relative orientation of growth direction and lattice strains proves to be of crucial importance. The obtained solutions show that elasticity-induced dendritic selection leads to higher transition velocities than classical dendritic growth. In eutectoid transitions, twinned isolated dendrites can appear when the initial seed includes both emerging solid phases. At low undercooling of the mother phase, the growth velocity of this pattern is higher than the velocities known from classical dendritic growth. In the case of monotectic transformations, we study the growth of an asymmetric solid dendrite along the liquid-liquid interface of the decomposed liquid phase.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the mechanism of}} <b>elastic</b> strains and <b>stresses</b> as the main controlling factor of structure change {{under the influence of}} temperature, magnetic field, hydrostatic pressure. We should take into account that the energy of elastic deformation is commensurate to the energy of electric interactions and that is much higher {{than the rest of the}} bonds of lower energy value. Besides, the energy <b>elastic</b> <b>stresses</b> are of long range, so it forms the linearity in magnetization and bulk change. These regularities requires a fundamental understanding of the laws of interaction with respect to accepted interpretation of quantum mechanical forces of short range that are attributes of magnetism formation. Due to the high sensitivity of electronic and resonance properties with respect to small changes of the structure, we were able to define the direct relation between <b>elastic</b> <b>stresses</b> and field-frequency dependencies, as well as to analyze the evolution of the dynamics of phase transitions and phase states. A cycle of studies of the influence of hydrostatic pressure on the resonance properties are presented also. The analysis of the effect of magnetic, magneto-elastic and elastic energy allowed us to define the combinations of magneto-elastic interactions. The role of <b>elastic</b> <b>stresses</b> in the linear changes of the magnetostriction, magnetization, magnetoelasticity of single-crystal magnetic semiconductors is described in details.
