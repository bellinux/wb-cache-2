Jet A is an aircraft gas turbine fuel currently in wide use. No. 2 HH was selected to represent the properties of future turbine fuels, particularly experimental Reference Broad Specification, which, under NASA sponsorship, was considered as a possible next-generation fuel. Tests were conducted with varying fuel flow rates, delivery pressures and fuel pretreatments (including preheating and deoxygenation). Simulator wall temperatures were varied between 422 K and 672 K at fuel flows of 0. 022 to 0. 22 Kg/sec. Coking rate was determined at four equally-spaced locations {{along the length of}} the simulator. Fuel samples were collected for infrared analysis. The dependence of coking rate in Jet A may be correlated with surface temperature via an activation energy of 9 to 10 kcal/mole, although the results indicate that both bulk fluid and surface temperature affect the rate of decomposition. As a consequence, flow rate, which controls bulk temperature, must also be considered. Taken together, these results suggest that the decomposition reactions are initiated on the surface and continue in the bulk <b>fluid.</b> The <b>coking</b> rate data for No. 2 HH oil are very highly temperature dependent above approximately 533 K. This suggests that bulk phase reactions can become controlling in the formation of coke...|$|R
50|$|The {{existence}} in Alberta of {{large quantities of}} surface bitumen (oil) mixed with sand {{has been known for}} many years. In the late 1970s the commercial production of synthetic crude oil from this bitumen began near Fort McMurray. Construction at this site, by a company known as Syncrude, began in 1973 and the first crude oil was produced there in 1978. The complex and costly production process involves scraping the sticky bitumen-laden sand from the surface, transporting it to a processing facility, removing the sand from the bitumen and upgrading the bitumen to a product known as light sweet crude. The technical scale of the operation is very large. Initially the sandy tar-like bitumen was scrapped from the ground using gigantic powered rotating mechanical wheels equipped with scraping buckets and the oil sand was placed on conveyor belts for transport to the processing plant. However, the severely cold Albert winters caused the continuous breakdown of the machinery and a new technique was developed. This involves the use of gigantic power shovels and dumptrucks to deliver the bitumen laden sand to the processing plant. Once at the plant the bitumen is removed from the sand with a process that involves the use of hot water. The bitumen is then subjected to <b>fluid</b> <b>coking,</b> hydroprocessing, hydrotreating and reblending. Syncrude is the largest producer of synthetic crude oil from bitumen sand {{in the world and the}} largest producer of oil from a single site in Canada.|$|E

The main objective of this thesis is to determine the effect of interacting spray jets on the liquid distribution in a Fluid Coker. This was accomplished by using a low temperature experimental model of <b>Fluid</b> <b>Coking</b> to estimate the liquid distribution. Preliminary screening of nozzle positions was accomplished by the use of conductance measurements. A binder solution was then utilized to further investigate the agglomerates produced for the most interesting nozzle positions.

The DOE objectives are to further {{reduce the cost of}} coal liquefaction to a more competitive level. In this project the primary focus is on the use of low-rank coal feedstocks. A particular strength is the use of process-derived liquids rather than model compound solvents. The original concepts are illustrated in Figure 1, where they are shown on a schematic of the Wilsonville pilot plant operation. Wilsonville operating data have been used to define a base case scenario using run {number_sign} 263 J, and Wilsonville process materials have been used in experimental work. The CAER has investigated: low severity CO pretreatment of coal for oxygen rejection, increasing coal reactivity and mg inhibiting the propensity for regressive reactions; the application of more active.

40|$|Monitoring the {{fluidization}} quality {{represents an}} operating challenge for many processes {{in which a}} liquid is sprayed into a gas-fluidized bed, such as <b>fluid</b> <b>coking,</b> fluid catalytic cracking, gas-phase polymerization, agglomeration and drying. Although the presence of liquid will generally have an adverse effect on fluidization, there are often strong incentives in operating with high liquid loadings. For the <b>fluid</b> <b>coking</b> process, for example, operating at lower reactor temperature increases yield and reduces emissions but increases the bed wetness, which may lead to local zones of poor mixing, local defluidization {{and a reduction in}} fluidization quality, compromising the reactor performance and stability. The objective {{of this study is to}} develop reliable methods to quantify the effects of liquids on fluidized beds. This study examined several methods to evaluate the fluidization quality. Each method was tested in a 3 m tall column, 0. 3 m in diameter. Bed wetness was achieved with an atomized spray of various liquids, spanning a wide range of liquid properties. The introduction of liquid in a fluidized bed may result in the formation of wet agglomerates that settle at the bottom of the bed. The liquid may also spread on the particles, increasing their cohesivity and reducing the bed fluidity. Several experimental methods were developed to characterize the effect of liquids on fluidization. Some methods such as the falling ball velocity or the detection of micro-agglomeration from the entrainment of fine particles, are unaffected by agglomerates and detect only the change in bed fluidity. Other methods, such as deaeration or the determination of bubble size from the TDH, are affected by agglomerate formation and changes in bed fluidity...|$|E
40|$|Fluidized {{beds are}} widely used {{for a variety of}} {{processes}} such as food, pharmaceutical, petrochemical and energy production. As a typical application of fluidized beds, the <b>fluid</b> <b>coking</b> process uses thermal cracking reactions to upgrade heavy oils and bitumen from oil sands. In order to maintain a well fluidized bed and a satisfactory operation, a series of supersonic nozzles are used to inject high pressure steam in the bed to maintain the coke particle within an optimal range. Currently, the attrition nozzles consume a large florwrate of high pressure and superheated steam, which accounts for about 40 % of the total energy consumption in <b>fluid</b> <b>coking</b> reactors. Improving the efficiency of the attrition process would increase energy efficiency and reduce sour waste water production, reducing the environmental impact of heavy oil upgrading. Therefore, the main objective of the present thesis is an experimental and numerical study of particle attrition with supersonic nozzles in high temperature fluidized beds. The specific objective is to improve particle grinding efficiency and reduce the steam consumption in the <b>fluid</b> <b>coking</b> process. To achieve the research objective, the primary investigations focused on the solids entrainment and penetration of jets issuing from supersonic nozzles, which have significant effects on particle attrition. Novel measuring techniques, therefore, were developed to accurately measure the flowrate of solids entrained into the jet and its penetration length. The numerical and experimental studies reveal that the jet penetration lengths are related to the two-phase Froude number. A new correlation was developed to predict the penetration length of jets issuing from supersonic nozzles in high temperature fluidized beds, based on Benjelloun’s correlation and the Froude number. The attrition experimental results demonstrate that larger scale nozzles, operating with a high flowrate of a low molecular weight gas at high temperature provide the highest grinding efficiency. A jet-induced attrition model in fluidized beds at high temperature has been proposed and developed. The model is a coupled Eulerian-Eulerian multiphase model with a population balance method. The particle-particle interactions are described with the kinetic theory of granular flow. Experimental results were used to determine and modify the critical parameters of the model. The best prediction was obtained using the Ghadiri breakage kernel, generalized daughter size distribution function, and discrete solution method. Finally, the research focused on the enhancement of jet-induced attrition in fluidized bed. A twin-jet nozzle gave a grinding efficiency that is about 35 % higher than with a single nozzle. The benefits of the twin-jet nozzle seem stronger at higher nozzle pressures and high temperature. It is likely that the twin-jet nozzle entrains more solids into the jets when compared with a single nozzle with the same gas flowrate...|$|E

To achieve these objectives, gas-atomized liquid sprays were produced inside a large scale fluidized bed using commercial scale nozzles. Liquid distribution was monitored by measuring the conductance of the fluidized bed. Results indicate that the altered geometry caused by erosion may enhance liquid distribution among the fluidized bed particles and increase the rate of moisture released from these agglomerates...|$|E

Athabasca petroleum cokes obtained from Suncor delayed coking and Syncrude <b>fluid</b> <b>coking</b> operations and a high sulphur Nova Scotia coal were used for these tests. Static combustion tests at 8500 C were carried out in a muffle furnace and compared with results found for a bench scale fluidized bed unit at the same temperature.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to investigate the effects of applied bed mixing and vapor phase residence time on the thermal cracking of agglomerating and non-agglomerating feedstock. Bitumen thermal cracking was investigated using a novel Mechanically Fluidized Reactor system and a pilot-scale <b>Fluid</b> <b>Coking</b> Reactor. Bed mixing and vapor residence time were studied to determine their impacts on agglomerate distributions, yields, {{and the quality of}} liquid product. Birchwood pyrolysis was investigated using a fluidized bed reactor to determine the impacts of particle-bed mixing on the pyrolysis of a non-agglomerating feedstock, to provide contrast to the agglomerating bitumen-coke system. It was observed that applied bed mixing destroyed agglomerates and dispersed the trapped reacting feedstock among smaller fragments, leading to reductions in coke yield and increased liquid production. Applied bed mixing resulted in lower viscosity, lower-molecular weight liquid product at short vapor phase residence times. Prolonged vapor phase residence times facilitated the cracking of vapors into non-condensable gas, while increasing the concentration of more refractory, higher-viscosity, higher-molecular weight components in the liquid product. In addition, it was determined that the use of a feeding system which disperses non-agglomerating biomass upon injection, in conjunction with a fluidized bed pyrolyzer, is an effective system and enhancing particle-feedstock mixing further provides no additional benefits for pyrolysis...|$|E
40|$|<b>Fluid</b> <b>coking</b> is a non-catalytic {{process where}} heavy {{hydrocarbon}} feed, sprayed using jets into a fluidized bed reactor, cracks upon contacting hot coke particles and produces valuable volatile fractions. It {{is estimated that}} the Alberta tar sands contain 1. 7 trillion barrels of oil, equivalent to 35 % of the world’s crude oil reserves, of which the majority is processed using fluid cokers. Important parameters that affect the yield of fluid cokers include the feed jet stability and therefore its ability to entrain and mix the injected feedstock with the fluidized coke particles. To this purpose, this study investigated {{the effect of the}} use of various types of draft tubes, placed downstream of the feed jet to enhance mixing, on solids entrainment and jet stability. Specifically, it has been demonstrated {{with the use of a}} gas-liquid and gas-only jet that an optimum distance exists between the nozzle and draft tube for entrainment of solids. For both cases, this optimal distance occurs as the jet touches the draft tube wall. However, for a gas-only jet this occurs at a shorter distances due to the increased angle of expansion. The angles of expansion were confirmed using triboelectric probe measurements. It has also been shown that the shape of the inlet to the draft tube will have an effect on the rate of solids entrainment as will the presence of pulsations in the jet...|$|E
40|$|Liquid {{injection}} in gas-solid fluidized beds is used {{in several}} industrial processes including food additive production, manufacturing of fertilizers, intermediate processing of pharmaceutical capsules and oil refining (i. e., Fluid CokingTM and Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC)). Good quality in the liquid distribution on the fluidized particles is fundamental in these processes either to ensure uniformity {{in the formation of}} desirable agglomerates, or to minimize their formation when undesirable. In the <b>Fluid</b> <b>Coking</b> process, for example, improving the liquid distribution and minimizing agglomerate formation will result in increasing the overall yield of the process and avoid operability problems. A new experimental model that simulates agglomerate formation in fluidized beds and investigates their stability was developed and tested at pilot plant scale. The model can be adapted to model different processes, but, in this work, Fluid CokingTM was selected {{as an example of a}} system to model. The liquid content of the agglomerates was estimated with a new, simple and accurate procedure that can be applied to the whole mass of the recovered agglomerates. This procedure was extended to estimate the recoating of individual agglomerates by different sprays resulting from multiple feed jets. The results indicated that reducing the average bed temperature or the mass of injected liquid (liquid load) enhanced the liquid distribution. Also, the maximum extent of liquid spread from wet to dry particles was estimated. The results indicated that the spreading is not a significant factor in reactors such as Fluid Cokers...|$|E
40|$|In the <b>Fluid</b> <b>Coking</b> process, if {{the local}} {{concentration}} of liquid is very high, particles may stick together which can eventually result in process upset {{because of poor}} fluidization or even defluidization, a condition commonly known in industry as 2 ̆ 2 bogging 2 ̆ 2. Using a capacitance sensor, the void distribution in a bed of coke particles can be visualized. The voidage fluctuations caused by gas bubbles {{have been shown to}} change dramatically as the bed becomes bogged. Therefore, capacitance sensors should be able to predict the bogging condition in fluid cokers. The first part of the thesis focused on designing noiseless capacitance sensors {{that can be used to}} measure the liquid concentration and void distribution in a fluidized bed. The effect of bogging on the distribution of a liquid sprayed into fluidized bed was then investigated by determining the impact of bogging on the breakage rate of the liquid-solid agglomerates. Pressure measurements are easier to perform in industrial units than capacitance measurements. The knowledge acquired with capacitance measurements was then applied to the design of early bogging detection methods from pressure measurements. Detection of bogging with acoustic measurements is discussed in the next section. The speed of sound was measured at different levels of particles cohesiveness and fluidization velocities. The last part of the thesis applies the capacitance sensors to the measurement of jet cavity fluctuations.

40|$|In the <b>fluid</b> <b>coking</b> process, bitumen {{and steam}} are sprayed into a {{fluidized}} bed of coke particles. The liquid reacts {{on the surface}} of the hot particles to give distillate products, light gases and coke. A good primary particle/liquid mixing in the spray jet is required in order to achieve high yields of valuable products and minimize operability problems due to particles agglomeration or loss of bed fluidity. An Enhanced Solids Entrainment (ESE) device has been proposed to improve the mixing of droplets and particles during injection. It consists of a cylindrical tube mounted co-axially downstream of the spray nozzle. The objective of this study is to develop an effective and convenient non-invasive technique to quantify the improvements in liquid distribution on the particles that results from the use of ESE device. A slug of 30 vol% ethanol in water solution is sprayed into a fluidized bed of sand. The bed is defluidized shortly after the start of the ethanol water injection. Then, the gas-solid contacting pattern is changed to fixed bed, with downward airflow. The evaporation rate can be obtained from the measured concentration of ethanol in the gaseous effluent. The evaporation rate depends on the wetted area that is exposed to the gas. Good primary dispersion of the liquid on particles yields a large exposed wetted area and, hence, a high evaporation rate. A model is used to estimate the distribution of liquid on the particles from the measured evaporation rate. The experimental results show that the ESE device produces a more uniform primary liquid distribution on the particles, increasing by 7 to 21 % the mass of solids contacted by the injected liquid...|$|E
40|$|The Advanced Concepts for Direct Coal Liquefaction {{program was}} {{initiated}} by the Department of Energy in 1991 to develop technologies that could significantly {{reduce the cost of}} producing liquid fuels by the direct liquefaction of coal. The advanced 2 -stage liquefaction technology that was developed at Wilsonville over the past 10 years has contributed significantly toward decreasing the cost of producing liquids from coal to about $ 33 /bbl. It remains, however, the objective of DOE to further reduce this cost to a level more competitive with petroleum based products. This project, among others, was initiated to investigate various alternative approaches to develop technologies that might ultimately lead to a 25 % reduction in cost of product. In this project a number of novel concepts were investigated, either individually or in a coupled configuration that had the potential to contribute toward meeting the DOE goal. The concepts included mature technologies or ones closely related to them, such as coal cleaning by oil agglomeration, <b>fluid</b> <b>coking</b> and distillate hydrotreating and dewaxing.

40|$|During the <b>Fluid</b> <b>Coking</b> Process™ bitumen is sprayed into a {{fluidized}} bed of hot coke particles. The bitumen undergoes thermal cracking and is converted into gasses, condensable vapors, and solid coke, which deposits on the coke particles. These vapors rise through the vessel {{and result in}} entrainment of coke particles. Wet fine coke particles from the freeboard region enter the cyclone {{and contribute to the}} fouling of the Coker cyclones which can lead to the premature shut-down of Fluid Cokers. The primary objective of this research is to determine how bed wetness affects entrainment. First, a new {{fluidized bed}} was constructed, and a novel pseudo-isokinetic sampling was developed and tested to collect entrained solids. Then the entrainment from the dry bed in the bubbling and the turbulent regime was investigated. The cluster analysis was performed and showed an improvement in predicting the flux of solids ejected from bed surface, above the TDH, and across the freeboard. In the next chapter, the effect of the different levels of bed wetness on flux and size distribution of the entrained particles was studied, and the results were compared to the ones obtained for the dry bed. It was observed that in the bubbling regime, the presence of liquid can change the bubble properties in the bed which will affect the entrainment. However, the effect of low liquid loading on entrainment in turbulent regime was found to be negligible. In the final chapter, RPT was employed and {{it was found that the}} motion of ejected clusters in the freeboard could not be tracked as the clusters move too fast for the strength of radioactive that was used. Moreover, a new model to measure the entrainment of clusters in the freeboard using a modified radioactive tracer technique in which the detectors are collimated was proposed. It was found that this method only provides the decay coefficient of the clusters flux decay...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of several important industrial processes, such as <b>fluid</b> <b>coking</b> or fluid catalytic cracking, {{is dependent on}} the good distribution of liquid feed sprayed into a fluidized bed of hot inert or catalytic particles, respectively. Liquid injected into a fluidized bed is distributed in three different ways: (i) free moisture, or liquid coating individual particles; (ii) wet micro-agglomerates, which are fluidized; and (iii) wet macro-agglomerates, which settle {{to the bottom of the}} bed. This study develops and evaluates various methods for the determination of this moisture. In the study using electrical techniques, two different kinds of electrodes geometries are considered, one single rod electrode and 5 separate plate wall electrodes. Several nozzles are used to spray water into a gas-solid fluidized bed: scaled-down versions of regular industrial nozzles and a nozzle (HALR) that uses an exceptionally high flowrate of atomization gas to provide a nearly perfect dispersion of the injected liquid on fluidized particles. Since the HALR nozzle does not form agglomerates, it is ideal to calibrate various methods for the measurement of the free moisture. The properties of the wet agglomerates that are formed during injection are determined with a method that is only suitable for small beds. A sugar solution as a binder is injected into a fluidized bed, and the bed is defluidized to preserve the initial agglomerates until the entire bed dries out. The agglomerates are collected, sorted in different size cuts, and their initial liquid content is estimated from their sugar concentration. The bed conductance is shown to provide an accurate measurement of the free moisture in both small and large fluidized beds. While plate wall electrodes provide the most accurate results, both experimental measurements and modeling results show how rod electrode geometry could provide reliable estimates of the free moisture. The rod electrode is applied in a large fluidized bed with commercial-scale spray nozzles to determine the best nozzle premixer and the best nozzle type. Finally, a model is developed for predicting the bed conductance, using COMSOL Multiphysics and considering the collected agglomerates properties. The model is fully validated with experimental data...|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Droplet-particle {{collision}} {{interaction in}} a flowing gas stream {{is one of}} the major phase interaction phenomena in a wide class of multiphase process applications such as spouted bed coating, fluid catalytic cracking unit, <b>fluid</b> <b>coking</b> process for bitumen upgrade process etc. that govern the process performance to a significant extent. Such interactions are manifestations of complex hydrodynamics involving competing interplay of various forces e. g. viscous, capillary, inertial and gravity coupled with simultaneous heat and mass transport process which involves further complexity of phase change. Depending on the size ratio of the droplet-particle pair, relative velocity, physical properties, temperature difference, surface roughness and hydrophobicity; a number of different outcomes are possible which presumably affect the associated transport phenomena to a significant extent. For instance, inefficient contact of atomized feed droplets and hot catalyst particles adversely affects the desired product yield in a fluid catalytic cracking unit. Motivated by a dearth of knowledge in this field, the present research aims at investigating some of these interaction mechanisms with specific focus on the single droplet-particle system to broaden the mechanistic understandings using both non-invasive optical technique (high speed imaging) and numerical modelling wherever applicable. Based on the droplet-particle size ratio (Δ), there different systems were studied: Δ 1 and Δ ~ 1. For Δ 1 system, collision interactions between a small particle and a larger stationary supported spherical cap droplet were investigated at different particle impact velocities (Weber number ≈ 1. 4 - 33). Two outcomes were noted – particle capture or retention at interface and penetration through the droplet interface. A one dimensional model was developed based on force balance approach to predict these collision outcomes. Effect of different competing forces namely gravity, virtual mass, buoyancy, drag, capillary and pressure were analysed. Among others, the capillary force was noted to have dominating effect however effect of the drag force was also observed to be significant when impact velocity was increased. The earlier mentioned CFD model was modified to include the effect of particle motion utilizing a dynamic meshing technique. Using a static contact angle and no-slip wall boundary conditions, the CFD model predicted outcomes were in reasonable agreement with the high speed visualizations and force balance model predictions. Also investigated for the Δ > 1 system was the collision interactions between a small particle and a stationary liquid film confined in a capillary tube using different diameters of particle and impact velocities since the complete penetration behaviour of the impacting particle could not be studied with a supported droplet. Three different outcomes were noted based on the impact Weber number - particle capture/retention at top interface; particle capture or retention at bottom interface and complete penetration through both interfaces. A criterion was developed based on the energy balance approach to predict the collision outcomes. In complete penetration cases, the particle was observed to entrain a certain amount of liquid mass with it which was explained by the end-pinching mechanism of ligament breakup. A model based on the energy balance approach was developed to quantify this liquid mass carryover. Also an empirical correlation was obtained to correlate the liquid mass carryover and the particle Bond number. A sensitivity analysis on the predictions of CFD model was performed using different contact angle boundary conditions – advancing, static and receding contact angle which could only predict a specific instance of the outcome well and not the overall outcome. The simulated particle trajectory and velocity were compared with the experimental measurements. Also the contributions of pressure force and viscous force predicted by the CFD model were analysed to explain the collision outcomes wherein pressure force was found be higher than the corresponding viscous force by at least an order of magnitude. The Δ ~ 1 system was studied experimentally for normal collision between an impacting droplet and a stationary particle where two outcomes were noted – deposition in lower Weber number cases and film formation in higher Weber number cases. Also studied here was the interaction behaviour in higher Weber cases involving heat transfer. The film was observed to rupture when the film reached a limiting thickness due to intense vaporization involving nucleate boiling at the apex point of the particle. This system was also studied computationally using a coupled level-set and volume of fluid (CLSVOF) CFD model using different combinations of droplet-particle size ratio, impact Weber number and impact parameter (collision angle). Three distinct outcomes were noted – deposition, ripping and coating and skirt scattering in the increasing order of impact Weber number which reasonably agreed with the predictions of LBM model previously reported by Gac and Gradon (2014). In both ripping and coating and skirt scattering outcomes, separation of ligaments was explained by the end-pinching mechanism. It was shown that all outcomes are governed by a competition between surface energy and kinetic energy and while higher surface energy favours deposition, higher kinetic energy leads to separation. Force analysis reveals that both pressure force and viscous force increases when impact Weber number is increased. Rise of these forces occur specifically in the early phase of interaction followed by a sharp decay in higher Weber number cases indicating separation of liquid ligament from particle surface. Also investigated was the effect of impact parameter (collision angle) which was shown to be critical for droplet-particle interaction. Increase in impact parameter leads to significant decrease in contact area of liquid-solid interface which consequently results in inefficient momentum transfer. This was evident by the corresponding decrease in the magnitude of both force and strain rate. In continuation with this study, a droplet-particle collision induced heat transfer model was developed applicable for FCC environment. The model computes the heat transfer coefficient based on a conductive heat transfer mechanism involving wetted contact area and droplet-particle contact time based on the interaction mechanism of Δ < 1 system. The model also includes volume fraction of droplets and solid particles to account for the multiphase environment. The developed heat transfer sub-model was incorporated into a lumped parameter vaporization model to compute vaporization times for typical gas-oil feed droplets. Computed vaporization times were compared with the predictions of other heterogeneous vaporization models reported in literature and found to be in reasonable agreement. Finally, a multi-particle system involving injection of an acetone jet in a bubbling fluidized bed of Geldart A-B particles was briefly studied to understand the collision interactions of droplets in a multi-particle environment involving vaporization. Several interesting phenomena like jet breakup into multiple droplets, re-suspension of solid particles due to vapour explosion, droplet shape deformation, coalescence, levitation and nucleate boiling were noted. Also evolution of the vapour concentration profile in freeboard region was visualized using Schlieren imaging technique. Numerically, a two-way coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian CFD model was developed using the FLUENT platform to simulate the jet vaporization process using user defined source terms for heat transfer between the liquid jet and the bed. Simulated vaporization phenomenon qualitatively agreed with experimental observations and captured the key feature of the vaporization process indicating diffusing nature of vapour concentration profile from bed surface to bulk. The CFD model also indicated significant reduction of local bed temperature which indirectly explained the presence of particle agglomerates found in the experiment...|$|E
