30|$|A {{source of}} random torque {{will be the}} effect of {{residual}} atmospheric density in low Earth orbit [72]. A CubeSat at this altitude experiences free-molecular flow and is potentially subject to buffeting, especially from cross-track winds at high latitudes [73]. The induced torque due to imbalanced forces can be minimized by locating the centre of gravity close to the centre of pressure when in the relevant orientation to reduce the moment arm. During the quantum transmission phase, the satellite is oriented to present the minimal projected area, i.e. the 2 U- 3 U faces. The lack of <b>deployable</b> <b>solar</b> <b>arrays</b> is advantageous from this respect.

Bus voltage limiting is accomplished by a modularized shunt regulator which can survive any single part failure and meet all mission requirements.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{a method}} of using a root hinge drive {{assembly}} (RHDA) to control the solar array deployment is provided and a multi-DOF mechanism dynamic model {{of the system is}} established. In this way, the root hinge torque can be calculated iteratively. Then taking the predicted torque as a reference, a RHDA is designed for a large multiple-stage packaging and <b>deployable</b> <b>solar</b> <b>array</b> system. The control effect of the drive assembly is validated by ground tests. The test results indicate that the solar arrays can be deployed smoothly, and the deployment velocities are restricted by the drive assembly as expected. During the tests, the RHDA output speed and output torque are obtained. In order to examine the impact force when the yoke is lock-up with a hard stop, dynamics simulations are performed according to the actual behavior. The simulation result indicates that the designed RHDA reduces the impact force significantly and improves the lock-up reliability effectively...|$|E

40|$|The {{need for}} {{additional}} power on spinning satellites required development of <b>deployable</b> <b>solar</b> <b>arrays</b> activated, as on a 3 -axis vehicle, after separation from a booster or shuttle orbiter.

40|$|Small {{satellites}} {{and in particular}} CubeSats, have increasingly become more viable as platforms for payloads typically requiring much larger bus structures. As advances in technology make payloads and instruments for space missions smaller, lighter and more power efficient, a niche market is emerging from the university community to perform rapidly developed, low-cost missions on very small spacecraft - micro, nano, and picosatellites. In just the last few years, imaging, biological and new technology demonstration missions have been either proposed or have flown using variations of the CubeSat structure as a basis. As these missions have become more complex, and the CubeSat standard has increased in both size (number of cubes) and mass, available power has become an issue. Body-mounted solar cells provide a minimal amount of power; deployable arrays improve on that baseline but are still limited. To truly achieve maximum power, deployed tracked arrays are necessary.

In order to expedite the acceptance of thin-film photovoltaics for space applications, however, parallel development of flexible photovoltaics and the corresponding deployable structure is essential.

TFSA is a solar array technology that allows solar cells to be deposited onto a thin, flexible substrate. This substrate can be easily folded, which allows large solar arrays to collapse into a small space. The Aerospace Corporation has developed a small <b>deployable</b> <b>solar</b> <b>array</b> based on this technology. During this mission, the pico-satellite will deploy the TFSA. Once deployed, the voltage and current generated by the array will be monitored.

These are a Kenwood amateur radio communications system, a Basic-X micro-controller based computer system, and a power system. These components, along with the ability to be launched as a secondary payload help reduce costs. This mission is ideally suited for a pico-size satellite due to its short duration, low power requirements, and lack of pointing requirements.

The spacecraft is configured to be launched from a Pegasus XL vehicle. AXM {{is designed to provide}} unprecedented sensitivity to cosmic explosions seen in X-rays. These include the ejections of relativistic jets by black holes in the Galaxy, and the fireballs of gamma ray bursts that originate in distant Galaxies. Such events are captured with 31 cameras mounted on the AXM spacecraft to continuously view 97 % of the celestial sphere, excluding occultations by the Earth. The camera detectors are Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) devices, developed at CERN and used with coded masks for X-ray astronomy. The pointing orientations for the cameras presented a challenge to provide 4 p steradian viewing, while accommodating spacecraft subsystems and <b>deployable</b> <b>solar</b> <b>arrays</b> for power. The mounting orientation resembles the 32 faces and vertices of a soccer ball, with one camera eliminated to avoid the saturating effect of solar X-rays. The objective of continuous, all-sky viewing is accomplished with a three-axis stabilized attitude control subsystem with the solar panels pointed close to the Sun. The AXM mission is designed for launch into a ~ 600 -km altitude, circular, equatorial orbit. An approximately 1 degree spacecraft maneuver once per day will maintain the solar panels aligned with the Sun.
