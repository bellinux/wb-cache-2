40|$|Energy is a {{critical}} topic of debate today, and much interest has turned to renewable energy forms. The negative implications of fossil fuel use are outweighing their benefits, as the twenty-first century has seen environmental, economic, and social consequences unfold. Montana is {{in a unique position}} in that it has five forms of renewable energy for heating and electricity generation purposes. Solar, wind, small-scale hydro, biomass, and <b>geothermal</b> <b>energies</b> are available across the state. These energy forms have the potential to provide residences and businesses with heat and electricity year-round, using a seasonally complementary, integrated system. The current installation of renewable energy systems was investigated to show that Montanans have been able to develop infrastructure capable of providing energy in an efficient and sustainable manner. This also demonstrates that solar, wind, small-scale hydro, biomass, and <b>geothermal</b> <b>energies</b> should be regarded as viable forms of energy, rather than high-risk and experimental options. The technological innovation of renewable energy was also investigated. Research suggests that renewable energy technology is currently able to produce energy with higher efficiencies, and at a lowe...|$|R

5|$|<b>Geothermal</b> <b>energy</b> is {{heat energy}} {{generated}} {{and stored in}} the Earth. Thermal energy is the energy that determines the temperature of matter. The <b>geothermal</b> <b>energy</b> of the Earth's crust originates from the original formation of the planet and from radioactive decay of materials (in currently uncertain but possibly roughly equal proportions). The geothermal gradient, which is the difference in temperature between {{the core of the}} planet and its surface, drives a continuous conduction of thermal energy in the form of heat from the core to the surface. The adjective geothermal originates from the Greek roots γη (ge), meaning earth, and θερμος (thermos), meaning hot.|$|E

50|$|As {{the demand}} for {{electricity}} is growing everyday, {{the demand for}} power plants is growing everyday. Ethiopia is trying to implement a sustainable and strong economic development to overcome poverty and environmental issues.

Ethiopia has a total identified economically feasible potential of 45 GW of hydropower and 1,350 GW of wind power.

40|$|Abstract: This {{paper is}} based on a project {{combining}} solar and <b>geothermal</b> <b>energies</b> used for heating an individual home located in a mountainous region of southern France (Saint-Pierre Dels Forcats town). A solar field consists of 10 thermal solar collectors, with a total area of 21. 25 m 2 which recharge thermally a borehole of 100 m of depth. A heat pump extracts the heat energy to restitute it to the home with a heating floor of 100 m 2. The long-term objective is to develop a predictive control on the global system to realize financial and energy savings. In order to do this, a modeling of all the subsystems has to be done. This paper focuses of two of these sub-systems, the solar field and the heat pump. Depending on the level of knowledge of each subsystem, a physical model (thermal solar collectors) or a artificial intelligence methodology (heat pump) is used...|$|R

40|$|With {{the arrival}} of smart grid era {{and the advent of}} {{advanced}} communication and information infrastructures, bidirectional communication, advanced metering infrastructure, energy storage systems and home area networks would revolutionize the patterns of electricity usage and energy conservation at the consumption premises. Coupled with the emergence of vehicle-to-grid technologies and massive distributed renewable energy, there is a profound transition for the energy management pattern from the conventional centralized infrastructure towards the autonomous responsive demand and cyber-physical energy systems with renewable and stored energy sources. Under the sustainable smart grid paradigm, the smart house with its home energy management system (HEMS) plays an important role to improve the efficiency, economics, reliability, and energy conservation for distribution systems. In this paper, a brief overview on the architecture and functional modules of smart HEMS is presented. Then, the advanced HEMS infrastructures and home appliances in smart houses are thoroughly analyzed and reviewed. Furthermore, the utilization of various building renewable energy resources in HEMS, including solar, wind, biomass and <b>geothermal</b> <b>energies,</b> is surveyed.
