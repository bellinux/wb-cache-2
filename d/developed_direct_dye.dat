40|$|A {{model is}} {{proposed}} {{to explain the}} manner by which the uptake of <b>direct</b> <b>dyes</b> on cellulosic fibres is promoted by {{a reduction in the}} liquor ratio used for dyeing. According to the model, which invokes the concept of interstitial water in dyeing, reducing the liquor ratio promotes dye aggregation which reduces the solubility of the dye in the bulk dyebath phase, so that the inherent preference of the dye to favour the aqueous phase shifts towards the fibre phase. It is suggested that the same mechanism accounts for the promotion of <b>direct</b> <b>dye</b> uptake imparted by the addition of inorganic electrolyte to <b>direct</b> <b>dye</b> dyebaths.

The performance of Al- 13 in coagulation of dyes was observed through jar tests by comparing traditional Al salt, polyaluminum chloride (PACI), and purified Al- 13. The results showed that under most cases All 3 had significantly higher efficiency in removal of <b>direct</b> <b>dyes</b> than traditional Al salt and commercial PAC] with the exception of Direct Red 28 removal under high pH range. The coagulation of <b>direct</b> <b>dyes</b> could be greatly affected by pH. Reducing pH was favorable for preformed Al species in a broad pH range. For traditional Al coagulant, efficient dye removal only occurred in a relatively narrow pH range of near 6. 0. The outstanding coagulation behavior of Al- 13 Could be ascribed to its high charge neutralization ability, relative stability and potential self-assembly tendency. (C) 2006 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Dyeing of {{polyamide}} fibers {{is normally}} made with acid dyes, however, {{it is somewhat}} difficult to achieve uniformity and control of pH and temperature must be carefully made. The possibility to dye polyamide 6. 6 in a larger gamut of colours with good properties may be achieved using other classes of dyes after plasmatic modifications in textile substrates. Polyamide 6. 6 fabrics were treated with Double Barrier Discharge (DBD) plasma obtained at atmospheric conditions in a semi-industrial machine and very positive results were obtained when dyeing is made with <b>direct</b> <b>dyes.</b> Surface modifications were evaluated, namely, roughness in terms of Atomic Force Microscopy, changes in chemical composition by X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and microstructural analysis by SEM. In order to optimize dyeing process, different dye concentrations, pH and temperatures were attempted on dyeing with DBD treated fabrics. Important parameters were studied such as exhaustion, colour strength (K/S) and washing fastness. Chemical and physical effects of plasmatic discharge contribute to excellent results obtained in yield, exhaustion and fastness of dyeing of polyamide with <b>direct</b> <b>dyes</b> demonstrating extensive improvement of dye exhaustion from baths, easily achieving 100 % in shorter dyeing times.
