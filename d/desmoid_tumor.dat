A 20 -year-old female patient with adenomatous polyposis underwent a right colectomy at 13 years of age. Five years later, she developed an abdominal <b>desmoid</b> <b>tumor</b> that was resected. After 2 more years, a recurrent <b>desmoid</b> <b>tumor</b> {{was found in the}} same region. This tumor grew rapidly and quickly became massive. The doubling time was estimated to be 122 days, based on the computed tomography findings. When we analyzed the APC gene in the recurrent <b>desmoid</b> <b>tumor,</b> we found a novel frame-shift mutation at codon 1564. This frame-shift mutation changed TTA to TAG, which is a stop codon. Northern blot analysis and immunohistochemical analysis for OPN, a GRGDS (glycine-arginine-glycine-aspartic acid-serine) - containing adhesive molecule, revealed abundant amounts of OPN mRNA and protein expression in this <b>desmoid</b> <b>tumor.</b> We postulated that the truncated APC protein and OPN expression might be involved in the invasive nature of this recurrent <b>desmoid</b> <b>tumor.</b> A primary cell culture derived from the <b>desmoid</b> <b>tumor</b> was assessed for chemosensitivity to 5 -fluorouracil, cisplatin, doxorubicin, colchicine, docetaxel, and anti-OPN antibody.

40|$|<b>Desmoid</b> <b>tumors</b> (aggressive fibromatosis) are locally {{invasive}} {{soft tissue}} tumors in which beta-catenin/TCF 3 mediated Wnt signaling is activated. More than 80 % of <b>desmoid</b> <b>tumors</b> contain activating mutations in beta-catenin. It {{has been shown}} that the Wnt signaling pathway interacts with Wilms' tumor gene 1 (WT 1) in normal kidney development and plays a role in the genesis of some Wilms' tumors. About 15 % of Wilms' tumors contain WT 1 mutations and of these, about 50 % contain beta-catenin mutations. This overlap in mutation pattern of WT 1 and beta-catenin in Wilms' tumor suggests that these 2 genes may collaborate in the genesis of a subset of Wilms' tumors. To investigate whether this hypothesis could be extended to other Wnt-dependent tumor types, we searched for WT 1 mutations and studied WT 1 expression in beta-catenin mutant <b>desmoid</b> <b>tumors.</b> We investigated the expression of WT 1 mRNA and protein in <b>desmoid</b> <b>tumors.</b> Medium to high abundant levels of WT 1 mRNA were detected by TaqMan quantitative PCR in all tested desmoid cells, whereas adjacent normal fibroblasts showed less expression of WT 1. Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry confirmed this overexpression at the protein level. A mutational screen of the WT 1 zinc-finger region by sequence analysis did not identify any mutations. Finally, we investigated a possible role of beta-catenin on WT 1 regulation and vice versa. Overexpression of different beta-catenin mutants in the HEK 293 T cell line did not modulate WT 1 promoter activity and WT 1 did not affect beta-catenin /TCF transcriptional activity in this cell line. These results show that the wild-type WT 1 gene is strongly overexpressed in beta-catenin mutant <b>desmoid</b> <b>tumors</b> and {{may play a role in}} tumorigenesis of <b>desmoid</b> <b>tumors,</b> similar to what has been suggested in some epithelial malignancies. status: publishe...|$|R

Case reports: Case 1 is a 31 -year-old woman who presented with nipple retraction. An ultrasound revealed BIRAD V in both breasts. She underwent a bilateral excisional biopsy under ultrasound mark with the pathology result of extra-abdominal <b>desmoid</b> <b>tumor</b> in both breasts. The patient had a bilateral mastectomy with silicone implantation due to the involved margins by excision. She remained tumor free after 7 -year follow-up. Case 2 is a 28 -year-old woman who presented with a lump on her right breast that she had discovered ~ 2 months earlier. An ultrasound showed a spiculated mass in the right breast and some circumscribed hypoechoic masses in both breasts. A bilateral breast excision was done. The pathology result was an extra-abdominal <b>desmoid</b> <b>tumor.</b> She had recurrence on both sides and underwent a mastectomy and silicone implantation.

40|$|<b>Desmoid</b> <b>tumors</b> are fibromatous lesions {{occurring}} both sporadically and {{in patients}} with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP).

We found that whereas FAP-associated <b>desmoid</b> <b>tumors</b> are caused by germline APC mutations followed by somatic inactivation of the wild-type APC allele, sporadic desmoids are usually characterized by oncogenic mutations in the b-catenin gene, both identical molecular alterations to those found {{in the vast majority of}} colorectal cancers.
