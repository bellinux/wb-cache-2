40|$|Because of {{the growing}} {{importance}} of object-oriented programming, a number of testing approaches have been proposed. Frankl et al. propose {{the application of the}} functional approach, using algebraic specifications for the generation of test cases and the validation of methods. Given a specification, Frankl et al. propose that <b>equivalent</b> <b>terms</b> should give observably equivalent objects, and offer general heuristics on the selection of <b>equivalent</b> <b>terms</b> for testing. Their guidelines, however, are only supported by limited empirical results, do not have a theoretical basis, and provide no guarantee of effectiveness. In this paper, we define the concept of a fundamental pair as a pair of <b>equivalent</b> <b>terms</b> which are formed by replacing all the variables on both sides of an axiom by normal forms. We prove that an implementation is consistent with respect to all <b>equivalent</b> <b>terms</b> if and only if it is consistent with respect to all fundamental pairs. In other words, the testing coverage of fundamental pairs is identical to that of all <b>equivalent</b> <b>terms,</b> and hence we need only concentrate on the testing of fundamental pairs. Our strategy is mathematically based, simple, and much more efficient. Furthermore, it underscores the usefulness of axiom-based specifications...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Information {{retrieval}} applications utilizing <b>equivalent</b> <b>terms</b> (e. g. synonyms, alternative spellings. expansions of acronyms and abbreviations), {{face the}} problem that the appropriateness of polysemous candidate terms cannot be known a priori. This paper describes a method of utilizing {{the context of the}} query words in order to provide a clue to selecting, from among the possible <b>equivalent</b> <b>terms,</b> the ones that have a higher utility, where utility is defined as likeliness to improve recall while preserving precision. A method of “seeding” the system with thousands of potential contextual relations enables a rapid runtime assignment of context to the user’s present query. The result is the broadening of retrieval through <b>equivalent</b> <b>terms,</b> without the typical concomitant decrease in precision. 1 1...|$|R
