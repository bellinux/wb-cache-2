5|$|The central {{range was}} begun around 1500, {{possibly}} as a two-storey building containing a great hall, although only fragments {{of this building}} remain. The south entrance to the tower house was blocked up, and replaced with a ground floor entrance from the east. A new stair tower, with a broad spiral stair, was built at the south-east corner. Originally topped by a conical roof, this stair gave access to the upper floors in the tower, and to the central range. Around 1570, the 4th Earl of Morton rebuilt the block, extending it further south to form new apartments. This block, forming the present three-storey central range, includes a vaulted kitchen and cellar in the basement, with suites of rooms above. The two bedrooms {{on the first floor}} each have their own closets and garderobes, or privies. The west apartment is accessed from the terraced garden, via another stair to the south-west, and has a private stair which led up to another chamber above, suggesting that these were the Earl and Countesses apartments. The upper storey, whose timber floor is now missing, comprised three more apartments, including one over the stair. The exterior of the block is decorated with a horizontal <b>decorative</b> <b>strip</b> of masonry known as a string course. One first-floor window is decorated with carved stone pilasters and strapwork, in a similar style to windows at Edinburgh Castle and Drochil Castle, in the Borders, both of which were built under Morton's Regency.|$|E
25|$|The irregular-shaped {{pavilion}} {{is built}} in the neoclassical style with a dome at one end. The station is lined in white marble with many bronze inserts. The walls of the vestibule are painted red and escalator balustrades are decorated with red plastic. There is a <b>decorative</b> <b>strip</b> of red stone on the upper portion of the walls in the underground hall, {{and the center of}} the station platform is constructed of red granite.|$|E
50|$|Another {{close by}} site is “Vega de la Peña”, about 4 km north of El Cuajilote. This place was {{inhabited}} between 900 and 1500 AD, when their inhabitants constructed the “Fretwork Temple”, thus called because its facade exhibits a <b>decorative</b> <b>strip</b> that alludes to Xicalcoliuhqui or fire serpent.|$|E
50|$|With {{launch of}} Rapid Spaceback {{hatchback}} in 2013, the Rapid models received some enhancements: for instance the rear power windows could be operated {{from the driver}} seat, the dashboard can be delivered with <b>decorative</b> <b>strips</b> in one of four options (Graphite metallic, Aluminium look, Piano White and Piano Black).|$|R
50|$|During final construction, a small {{section of}} the outside corners is carved or routed out and filled with binding {{material}} on the outside corners and <b>decorative</b> <b>strips</b> of material next to the binding, which are called purfling. This binding serves to seal off the endgrain of the top and back. Binding and purfling materials are generally made of either wood or high quality plastic materials.|$|R
50|$|Soumaks {{tend to be}} finely woven, and {{although}} not as durable as piled carpets, they are stronger than kilims. The soumak wrapping often covers the whole surface of a bag or rug, but it can equally be applied in <b>decorative</b> <b>strips,</b> contrasting with the plainer and thinner flatweave areas. For example, camel bags from Malatya in Eastern Turkey could be woven in simple flatweave stripes of red and blue, with broad strips of soumak weft-wrapping with motifs for fertility and protection.|$|R
5000|$|The canal was {{designed}} by Peter Joseph Lenné based on earlier plans by Johann Carl Ludwig Schmid and was built between 1848 and 1852. Besides its water transport and land drainage roles, it was also conceived as a design element {{in the development of}} the surrounding area, and {{was designed}} as a <b>decorative</b> <b>strip,</b> flanked by quays lined with neoclassical buildings.|$|E

5000|$|Sambas {{were painted}} {{standard}} in two colors. Usually, {{the upper part}} was colored white. The two colored sections were separated by a <b>decorative</b> <b>strip.</b> Further the bus had a so-called [...] "hat": {{at the front of}} the van the roof was just a little longer than the car itself to block the sun for the driver. The windows had chrome tables and the van had a more comprehensive dashboard than the normal T1.|$|E

5000|$|The Samuel Hoffman Jr. House {{is located}} in the West End of Davenport, Iowa, United States. Samuel Hoffman Jr. was a {{bookkeeper}} at the German Savings Bank downtown. The house exhibits details of the Stick-Eastlake style such as the diagonal and short vertical stickwork on the gables. It also features molded bargeboards and <b>decorative</b> <b>strips</b> applied to the window on the east side. The porch, which is not original to the structure, features simple and geometric details that do not distract {{from the rest of the}} house. [...] The residence has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1983.|$|R
50|$|The {{entrance}} foyer has vinyl {{floor tiles}} {{and a low}} ceiling clad in perforated panels with <b>decorative</b> cover <b>strips.</b> Round columns support the gallery above. One panel of a sliding decorative metal screen remains in its track under the lighting cove.|$|R
50|$|Many fragments, {{parts of}} friezes and panels with figure and {{ornamental}} carving, {{have been recovered}} by archaeology, usually after being reused in rebuilt churches. The largest group of Anglo-Saxon sculpture is from a former abbey at Breedon-on-the-Hill in Mercia, {{with a number of}} elements of different dates, including lively narrow <b>decorative</b> <b>strip</b> friezes, many including human figures, and panels with saints and the Virgin. The most intriguing fragments are firstly a group, now at Canterbury Cathedral, from St Mary's Church, Reculver, in Kent, from a large composition with many figure scenes and groups on a curved surface, evidently of high quality, though uncertain date (perhaps early 10th century). A Sacrifice of Isaac and an Ascension can be identified, and parts of standing groups of saints, prophets or apostles.|$|E
50|$|The {{main part}} of the helmet is {{constructed}} from two sheets of bronze, one forming the front and one the back of the helmet, that are riveted together at the sides and top. A separate crescent-shaped bronze piece is riveted {{to the bottom of the}} front sheet, and two conical bronze horns with terminal knobs are riveted to the top of the helmet. A <b>decorative</b> <b>strip</b> with a row of rivets overlays the join between the front and back sheets, and goes around the base of the horns. At the end of the strip, on both sides of the helmet, is a ring fitting for a chin-strap or cheekpiece. There are a number of small holes around the bottom edge, which may have been used to attach a lining.|$|E
50|$|The lantern is 17 meters {{high and}} the dome is 136.57 meters from the base {{to the top of}} the cross. The ogival dome was built with 16 ribs and an inner {{diameter}} of 42.7 meters. It begins above the drum and attico (the <b>decorative</b> <b>strip</b> above the drum), which are about 18 meters tall. The two shells of the dome are brick and each about 1.19 meters thick at the base of the dome. Because the shells separate from each other as they rise, the dome is 2.7 meters thick overall. The sixteen ribs connect the two shells together and are made of stone. The iron chains included in the design to contain the dome's lateral thrust have had to be replaced ten times since it was constructed. Carlo Maderno's extended nave, built between 1609 and 1614, included bays covered by oval domes with lanterns.|$|E
50|$|Commodore Theatre is a {{historic}} movie theater located at Portsmouth, Virginia. It was built in 1945, and is an Art Deco style, 1,000-seat theater building. The two-story front facade features a plain mass of yellow pressed brick decorated with horizontal stripes of brown brick on the upper level with a central pavilion of curved-top vertical pylons of Indiana limestone and <b>decorative</b> <b>strips</b> of glass block. The lower level of the facade is composed of Indiana limestone ashlar veneer with a base of black marble. A dominant element of the auditorium is the pair of restored murals on the side walls representing the progress of America and the commerce and industry of Hampton Roads.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the top of}} {{the scroll}} is a thin wooden bar, called tiangan (天杆), on which a cord is {{attached}} for hanging the scroll. [...] Two <b>decorative</b> <b>strips,</b> called jingyan (惊燕; literally [...] "frighten swallows"), are sometimes attached to {{the top of the}} scroll. At the bottom of the scroll is a wooden cylindrical bar, called digan (地杆), attached to give the scroll the necessary weight to hang properly onto a wall, but it also serves to roll up a scroll for storage when the artwork is not in display. The two knobs at the far ends of the lower wooden bar are called zhoutou (軸頭) and help to ease the rolling of the scroll. These could be ornamented with a variety of materials, such as jade, ivory, or horn.|$|R
50|$|Defined {{vertically}} by plain pilasters, the elevations are unified {{by employing}} semi-circular arched openings, <b>decorative</b> moulded sill <b>strips</b> and projecting window head cornices.|$|R

30|$|Hyperspectral imaging was {{particularly}} useful in identifying mixtures of ultramarine and indigo, which {{were hard to}} detect with other methods. For example, in Table  1 # 13 p 26 hyperspectral imaging confirms that ultramarine is the principal blue used for the clothes and the decorative borders around {{the window and the}} door. Indigo occurs in the <b>decorative</b> <b>strip</b> above the windows and the terrace and a mixture of the two blue pigments seems to have been used in the darker blue areas of the decorative border of the window and the terrace (Fig.  24). Similarly, in another example (Table  1, # 14) ultramarine was used alone in the king’s robe, the blue hats and the background, and was mixed with indigo and an organic red to create purple in the tent and on the dress of the figure in the left (Fig.  25). Indigo was used mostly in mixtures with orpiment in green areas and with ultramarine in darker blue or purple areas. Use of indigo alone can be clearly seen in the outline of the hill and the creases of the dress of the royal figure in the center (Fig.  25). Figure  26, (from Table  1, # 20), shows a somewhat different distribution of the two blues–ultramarine is mixed with lead white for the light blue area sky and mixed with indigo for dark blue robes.|$|E
5000|$|More recently, {{smooth finish}} helmets worn without a fabric cover, {{have become more}} common. A newly popular style in the hunter-jumper world {{features}} a lightly textured (less shiny) plastic shell with a <b>decorative</b> ventilation <b>strip</b> down the center. This design goes by many brand names, but, due to the ventilation strip, is informally called a “skunk helmet.” ...|$|R
50|$|The troupes perform shirtless. The main {{character}} wears more refined costumes than other characters. Sanap phlao (calf length trousers) is used. The <b>decorative</b> cloth <b>strips</b> include hoi na (hanging from the front) and hoi khang (hanging from the side). Other decorative accessories are the Sangwan (jewels sashes), thap suag (a pendant), krong kho (an embroidered collar) and a soet (a pointed crown-like headdress).|$|R
25|$|Caribou or Porcupine caribou, wild caribou Rangifer tarandus granti (tuntu sg tuntuk dual tuntut pl or tuntupik sg tuntupiik dual tuntupiit pl or tuntupiaq sg tuntupiak dual tuntupiat pl in Yup'ik and Cup'ik, tuntupig in Cup'ig). Caribou skin {{is ideal}} for cold, dry weather as each hair has a {{honeycomb}} core that traps air, which is an excellent insulator. Sealskins and caribou skins were always kept separate and not combined in the same garment except for occasional <b>decorative</b> <b>strips.</b> Yup’ik dance fans decorated with caribou throat hair, caribou leg-skins were made into high boots, sleeping bags for travel made by joining two caribou skins and fur-side-out fancy parkas. Historically, caribou were hunted {{in the fall and}} skins were brought home for skin clothing. Caribou hunts were discouraged by the Russian and American traders as they felt it took the trappers away from their trap lines. Prior to European contact, caribou were important not only for their meat but for the skins which were an important item used in clothing. The Russians encouraged the Eskimos to adopt Western-style dress in order to release more furs for trading. In the spring, some people hunted caribou along the inland river ways.|$|R
50|$|Visitors {{can watch}} huge (10 meter tall) Kiriko {{lanterns}} and smaller paper lanterns being carried {{through the streets}} along with portable shrines called omikoshi. Visitors can also eat all sorts of delicious festival foods, listen to Taiko drums being played and watch the main event. At the festival climax, seaside stacks of bamboo poles are torched as bonfires (some 4 or 5 story high). Gohei (<b>decorative</b> <b>strips</b> of white paper used in Shinto rituals) {{is tied to the}} bamboo. As the fire consumed the poles, competing groups of men struggled to pull down the blazing piles, claiming as their prize pieces of burnt bamboo along with the Gohei attached as symbols of good fortune. Victors then climb to the top of their respective Kiriko to hang their prize, purportedly to add to the good fortune of their village in the coming year. The giant Kiriko lanterns are indispensable to various festivals celebrated in Noto. Wajima's festival kirikos are especially distinctive because of their famous magnificent Wajima lacquer coatings. The lanterns also bear the inscription of a three-character Kanji poem, and on the reverse side, the village crest from which the Kiriko originate.|$|R
5000|$|The top, {{back and}} ribs of an {{acoustic}} guitar body are very thin (1-2 mm), so a flexible {{piece of wood}} called lining is glued into the corners where the rib meets the top and back. This interior reinforcement provides 5 to 20 mm of solid gluing area for these corner joints. Solid linings are often used in classical guitars, while kerfed lining is most often found in steel string acoustics. Kerfed lining is also called kerfing because it is scored, or [...] "kerfed"(incompletely sawn through), {{to allow it to}} bend with the shape of the rib). During final construction, a small section of the outside corners is carved or routed out and filled with binding material on the outside corners and <b>decorative</b> <b>strips</b> of material next to the binding, which are called purfling. This binding serves to seal off the end grain of the top and back. Purfling can also appear on the back of an acoustic guitar, marking the edge joints of the two or three sections of the back. Binding and purfling materials are generally made of either wood or plastic.|$|R
50|$|The bronze leaves {{attached}} to this porch, the Wolfstür (Wolf's Door), weigh 43 hundredweight altogether (cf. with this the Lousberg saga). The main entrance to the cathedral, the door was cast in Aachen around 800 and was located between the westwork and the octagon in the so-called hexadecagon up to 1788. The portal was restored in 1924. Each leaf is divided into eight rectangles - a number which had religious symbolism in Christianity, {{as a symbol of}} Sunday, the day of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ and also of perfection (as did twelve, also) and {{can be found in the}} measurements of the Palatine Chapel over and over again. These boxes were framed by <b>decorative</b> <b>strips,</b> which are made of egg-shaped decorations. The egg was considered a symbol of life and fertility from antiquity. In Christian belief it was imbued with the even wider symbolism of Eternal Life. The door-rings in the shape of lions' heads are wreathed by 24 (i.e. two times twelve or three times eight) acanthus scrolls - again to be understood at the deepest level through numerology. The Wolfstür's imitation of the shape of the ancient Roman temple door signifies Charlemagne's claim, to have established a New Rome in Aachen with the Palatine Chapel as the distinctive monumental building.|$|R
50|$|Created by the Native Americans of {{southern}} Florida, Seminole strip piecing {{is based on}} a simple form of <b>decorative</b> patchwork. Seminole <b>strip</b> piecing has uses in quilts, wall hangings, and traditional clothing. Seminole patchwork is created by joining a series of horizontal strips to produce repetitive geometric designs.|$|R
50|$|Openings in {{the side}} {{elevations}} are limited to two high-level terracotta vents and the rear elevation has a projecting gable with a central vertically aligned window. Each side of the projecting gable is a window of the same dimensions but with a concrete block and breeze block infill. The gable to the main roof has flat sheet cladding with three vertical, <b>decorative</b> timber cover <b>strips.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The tower shows typical {{features}} of Saxon architecture: walls of rendered rubble, with <b>decorative</b> pilaster <b>strip</b> work, and {{long and short}} work. [...] The pilasters do not provide any possible support—some are only very shallowly set into the wall. They are cut from Roman ashlars. [...] Oak beams survive at two levels in the tower; these would originally have supported higher floors. The first floor {{must have been a}} gallery, as there are no windows at ground floor level. [...] The tower has only a few, small, windows, with either round or triangular heads, and they are divided by a shaft. There are north and south doorways, which appear to have originally possessed timber porches. The roof would have been of timber construction, probably of stepped pyramidal form, and covered with shingles.|$|R
40|$|The {{villages of}} Resnik, Čučerje, Markuševac and Šestine, {{in which the}} {{research}} was conducted by the Ethnographic Museum between 1969 and 1979, are located north and southeast of Zagreb, and are ever more becoming its constituent parts. The traditional textile handiwork of the investigated area {{has a lot of}} common features, but there are some specifics too. The procurement of raw materials for weaving, and their processing, was the same in all these villages; some elements which were common for all of northwestern Croatia also appeared here. Thus, all four villages had the same tools for the processing of raw textile plants, and the same weaving tools (the horizontal type of loom, for instance). Hemp was grown in the area, while flax, cotton thread and silk had to be bought. The villages differed in division of labor related to hand-making textile. In Markuševac and Šestine there were male semi-professional weavers, in Resnik and Ščitarjevo weavers were exclusively women, while Čučerje had both variants. There, women were weaving textile for costumes, while men were making material for table-clothes, towels and bedding. They used different weaving techniques and decorations. Men 2 ̆ 7 s products have <b>decorative</b> <b>strips</b> in countless variants; women 2 ̆ 7 s ornaments are more elaborate, having a rich scale of colors and regular geometric or stylized floral motifs. The data reported on here could be collected only from people above forty years old. The process of withdrawal from textile handicraft in the described area started between World War I and World War II, and was completed by the 19502 ̆ 7 s. Main causes for this were the transformation of large family households (zadruge) to nuclear family households and the increasing employment in industry together with the decline of peasant family economy in general. One of the accompanying changes was switch from traditional clothes to more urban-style clothes, while other textile articles in the household were gradually replaced by those produced industrially...|$|R
500|$|The Ford Pinto {{went on sale}} on September 11, 1970 in one bodystyle, a {{fastback}} sedan with {{trunk and}} metal trunklid. [...] A hatchback became available on February 20, 1971, debuting at the Chicago Auto Show. In 1971, the Pinto brochure came with a paper cutout Pinto that one could fold to make a 3D model. Marketed as the Runabout, the hatchback went on sale five days later, priced at $2,062. The hatch itself featured exposed chrome hinges for the liftgate and five <b>decorative</b> chrome <b>strips,</b> pneumatic struts to assist in opening the hatch, a rear window approximately {{as large as the}} sedan's, and a fold down seat — a feature which became simultaneously an option on the sedan. The hatchback model matched the sedan in all other dimensions and offered [...] of cargo space with its seat folded. By 1972, Ford redesigned the hatch itself, with the glass portion of the hatch enlarged to almost the entire size of the hatch itself, ultimately to be replaced with a rear hatch that was entirely glass.|$|R
40|$|The San Bias Islands, one {{for each}} day of the year, lie on the Caribbean side of Panama in a chain of tiny atolls. The Cuna Indians, who left the {{mainland}} long ago seeking peaceful isolation, live a quiet communal life in the thatched houses that crowd these Islands. The Cunas have always been self-sufficient, raising their food, building their houses and canoes and making their tools, medicines and clothing. Their economy has long been based on the sale of coconuts, but some men work in the Canal Zone and some sail as merchant seamen and this income enables them to buy cloth and manufactured items, although their wants remain simple. The folk craft of making molas has existed for about one hundred twenty-five years, beginning when the Cunas moved from the mainland to the Islands where the cooler nights necessitated warmer clothing. The women sewed blouses with simple applique borders at first and gradually increased the size of these <b>decorative</b> <b>strips</b> until, with a panel in front and one in the back, only a yoke and short sleeves were needed to complete a kind of quilted garment. This blouse is worn with a dark colored, sarong-like wrapped skirt and bright red head scarf with painted yellow designs. Once every woman wore a gold nose ring and painted a black line down the center of her nose because a long nose was considered beautiful. This is a practice that seems to be dying out, but, when there was an effort to outlaw the wearing of molas, the women flatly refused. Although the women do not hold governing positions, the Cunas have a matriarchal society. A man may not sell property without his wife 2 ̆ 7 s permission and when a daughter marries, her husband is obligated to live with her family and contribute to its support. The Cuna women have developed the fine needlework of molas into a distinctive art found nowhere else in the world. The technique has been called reverse applique and is created from three or more layers of cloth. The cloth is basted together and the design drawn on the top layer. Using small scissors, the woman cuts through the top layer and with tiny, even stitches she catches the narrowly turned edge to the cloth beneath. She then cuts through to the next layer and sews the raw edges under to leave a narrow line of that color showing. This process is continued until the bottom layer appears and the shapes are outlined by a series of colored lines. Any space between the main shapes is filled by an all-over pattern of short cuts often revealing strips of color as a result of small pieces of various colored cloth underlaid in these areas. Regularly appliqued shapes may be superimposed on the mola and bits of embroidery in colored threads may be added details...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, a {{new body}} of work has emerged within {{contemporary}} art that they takes national borders as its subject matter. While much of this work explores the complexity of national borders, a primary focus within this {{body of work}} has been to document and represent the experience of migrants and refugees across these borders to a primarily Western audience. As such, borders have emerged as yet another discursive space where art and politics meet, engage in dialogue, and clash. Often, {{what is at stake}} in such a meeting is the tension between the work of art creating an environment of possible experience for the viewer, asking the viewer to examine her own capacity for empathy, and a voyeuristic Western gaze onto an essentialized subject who is a victim of global forces. In an era where difference, diversity and multiculturalism all become <b>decorative,</b> commercial and <b>stripped</b> of any potency as sites of resistance within contemporary art institutions, it is fair to ask what this new body of work allows and disallows. Is it just another way to elicit empathy from a Western audience through representations of trauma while uncritically engaging with their voyeuristic impulse? Or can it go further to avoid emotional essentialisms and recognize migratory self-determination and inspire social change? The following investigation attempts to unpack some of these tensions by putting a radical perspective on migration and borders alongside some contemporary exhibitions that foreground such issues...|$|R
