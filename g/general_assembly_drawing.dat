40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is a design of an {{aluminium}} scrap handling device. This device works in a roofed-over hall and it is stationary. Introduction to this thesis brings the usual machines used for handling of metal waste as alternatives to this device, and the reasons why these do not fulfil the customer’s demands. The work contains kinematics lay-out and force analysis. The shape and dimensions of the design derive from these chapters. The following part deals with {{the description of the}} major parts including the hydraulic system which provides all the working movements of the device.

40|$|In this article, we analyse an {{instance}} of revitalisation of a dormant interregional organisation {{dating back to the}} Cold War: the Zone of Peace and Cooperation of the South Atlantic (ZOPACAS), initially launched by South American and African states in 1986 through the UN <b>General</b> <b>Assembly.</b> <b>Drawing</b> on the concepts of “consensual hegemony” we argue that the current phase of ZOPACAS’ existence is characterised by Brazil’s efforts to rekindle it, thus reflecting its aspiration to create a new space of influence. Rather than pursuing more traditional forms of regional leadership, Brazil uses ZOPACAS as part of a persuasion-based strategy based on regional multilateralism that is designed in antagonism to other international organisations and Western powers. However, this strategy also faces important limitations resulting from resource constraints, lack of institutionalisation and an excessive exclusionary focus on minimising the role of global powers with interests in the region.

2500|$|The [...] "Campus Activities Board (CAB)", a student-run organization, runs several {{committees}} that oversee campus-wide activities and student services {{with a focus}} on evening and weekend programming. The Student Government Association (SGA) charters and provides most of the funding for these programs, and represents students' interests when dealing with the administration. SGA was developed under a model of shared governance with the Division of Student Affairs. The SGA maintains that it represents students through college governance, offers student services, and launches new programs and initiatives. This government consists of a dual executive of Co-Presidents along with an Executive Cabinet. The legislature is bicameral and consists of the elected Senate and the larger <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> which <b>draws</b> its membership from student organizations. The SGA Judicial Council acts as the judiciary, hearing SGA-related appeals as well as those resulting from student parking violations issued by the Department of Public Safety. Finally, an Election Committee oversees student government elections and decides on appeals that result from them.|$|R

The King also sent them £1000 to promote the Protestant religion (and loyalty to the throne) in the Highlands and Islands.

6000|$|Moray, Ochiltree, Pitarro, {{and many}} others being now exiles in England, whose Queen had subsidised and repudiated them and their revolution, things went hard with the preachers. For a whole year at least (December 1565-66) their stipends were not paid, the {{treasury}} being exhausted by military and other expenses, and Pitarro being absent. At the end of December, Knox and his colleague, Craig, were ordered by the <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> to <b>draw</b> up and print a service for a general Fast, to endure from the last Sunday in February to the first in March, 1566. One cause alleged is that the Queen's conversion had been hoped for, but now {{she said that she}} would [...] "maintain and defend" [...] {248c} her own faith. She had said no less to Knox at their first interview, but now she had really written, when invited to abolish her Mass, that her subjects may worship as they will, but that she will not desert her religion. {249a} It was also alleged that the godly were to be destroyed all over Europe, in accordance with decrees of the Council of Trent. Moreover, vice, manslaughter, and oppression of the poor continued, prices of commodities rose, and work was scamped. The date of the Fast was fixed, not to coincide with Lent, but because it preceded an intended meeting of Parliament, {249b} a Parliament interrupted by the murder of Riccio, and the capture of the Queen. No games were to be played during the two Sundays of the Fast, which looks as if they were still permitted on other Sundays. The appointed lessons were from Judges, Esther, Chronicles, Isaiah, and Esdras; the New Testament, apparently, supplied nothing appropriate. It seldom did. The lay attendants of the Assembly of Christmas Day which decreed the Fast, were Morton, Mar, Lindsay, Lethington, with some lairds.|$|R
