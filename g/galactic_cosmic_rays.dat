5|$|Radioactive cosmogenic 10Be is {{produced}} in {{the atmosphere of the}} Earth by the cosmic ray spallation of oxygen. 10Be accumulates at the soil surface, where its relatively long half-life (1.36 million years) permits a long residence time before decaying to boron-10. Thus, 10Be and its daughter products are used to examine natural soil erosion, soil formation and the development of lateritic soils, and as a proxy for measurement of the variations in solar activity and the age of ice cores. The production of 10Be is inversely proportional to solar activity, because increased solar wind during periods of high solar activity decreases the flux of <b>galactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays</b> that reach the Earth. Nuclear explosions also form 10Be by the reaction of fast neutrons with 13C in the carbon dioxide in air. This is one of the indicators of past activity at nuclear weapon test sites.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{relationship}} of the 27 -day variation of the <b>galactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> intensity with similar changes of the solar wind velocity and the interplanetary magnetic field based on the experimental data for the Bartels rotation period 2379 of 23 November 2007 - 19 December 2007. We develop a three dimensional (3 -D) model of the 27 -day variation of <b>galactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> intensity based on the heliolongitudinally dependent solar wind velocity. A consistent, divergence-free interplanetary magnetic field is derived by solving Maxwells equations with a heliolongitudinally dependent 27 -day variation of the solar wind velocity reproducing in situ observations. We consider two types of 3 -D models of the 27 -day variation of <b>galactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> intensity - (1) with a plane heliospheric neutral sheet, and (2) - with the sector structure of the interplanetary magnetic field. The theoretical calculation shows that the sector structure does not influence significantly on the 27 -day variation of <b>galactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> intensity as it was shown before based on the experimental data. Also a good agreement is found between the time profiles of the theoretically expected and experimentally obtained first harmonic waves of the 27 -day variation of the <b>galactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> intensity (correlation coefficient equals 0. 98 0. 02). The expected 27 -day variation of the <b>galactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> intensity is inversely correlated with the modulation parameter z (correlation coefficient equals - 0. 91 0. 05) which is proportional to the product of the solar wind velocity V and the strength of the interplanetary magnetic field B (z VB). The high anticorrelation between these quantities indicates that the predictable 27 -day variation of the <b>galactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> intensity mainly is caused by this basic modulation effect.

25|$|Without the {{protection}} of Earth's atmosphere and magnetosphere astronauts are exposed {{to high levels of}} radiation. A year in low Earth orbit results in a dose of radiation 10 times that of the annual dose on earth. High levels of radiation damage lymphocytes, cells heavily involved in maintaining the immune system; this damage contributes to the lowered immunity experienced by astronauts. Radiation has also recently been linked to a higher incidence of cataracts in astronauts. Outside {{the protection}} of low Earth orbit, <b>galactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays</b> present further challenges to human spaceflight, as the health threat from cosmic rays significantly increases the chances of cancer over a decade or more of exposure. A NASA-supported study reported that radiation may harm the brain of astronauts and accelerate the onset of Alzheimer's disease.

25|$|Possible {{acute and}} late {{risks to the}} CNS from <b>galactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays</b> (GCRs) and solar proton events (SPEs) are a {{documented}} concern for human exploration of our solar system. In the past, the risks to the CNS of adults {{who were exposed to}} low to moderate doses of ionizing radiation (0 to 2 Gy (Gray) (Gy = 100 rad)) have not been a major consideration. However, the heavy ion component of space radiation presents distinct biophysical challenges to cells and tissues as compared to the physical challenges that are presented by terrestrial forms of radiation. Soon after the discovery of cosmic rays, the concern for CNS risks originated with the prediction of the light flash phenomenon from single HZE nuclei traversals of the retina; this phenomenon was confirmed by the Apollo astronauts in 1970 and 1973. HZE nuclei are capable of producing a column of heavily damaged cells, or a microlesion, along their path through tissues, thereby raising concern over serious impacts on the CNS. In recent years, other concerns have arisen with the discovery of neurogenesis and its impact by HZE nuclei, which have been observed in experimental models of the CNS.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Concentrations of 10 Be in ice cores {{and marine}} sediments exhibit 2 peaks with {{significant}} enhancements at 35, 000 and 60, 000 BP. This radioisotope {{is produced in}} the upper atmosphere by spallation of cosmic-ray protons and sec-ondary neutrons on atmospheric nitrogen and oxygen. Previously suggested explanations for the increases include geomag-netic field reversals, a decrease in solar activity, and a supernova explosion. We propose an alternative explanation which involves {{a change in the}} galactic environment of the solar system. The structure of the heliosphere is investigated for a period when the Sun enters a cold, dense, unmagnetized interstellar cloud. Under these conditions, the heliosphere contracts to 25 % its present size, significantly affecting <b>galactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> modulation and increasing anomalous <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> fluxes.
