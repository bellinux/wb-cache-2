40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} the {{relation}} between <b>De</b> <b>Morgan</b> triples on the unit interval and Atanassov’s intuitionistic <b>De</b> <b>Morgan</b> triples is presented, showing how to obtain, in a canonical way, Atanassov’s intuitionistic <b>De</b> <b>Morgan</b> triples from <b>De</b> <b>Morgan</b> triples. Moreover, we also show that the automorphisms on the unit interval and on L∗ (the intuitionistic value lattice) are in one-to-one correspondence and how automorphisms on L∗ act on Atanassov’s intuitionistic <b>De</b> <b>Morgan</b> triples. It is also proved that the action of automorphisms and the canonical construction of <b>De</b> <b>Morgan</b> triples on L∗ commutes...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAn {{abstract}} algebra 〈A,∧,∨,⊥,⊤,¬,∼〉 {{is called}} a <b>De</b> <b>Morgan</b> Boolean algebra if 〈A,∧,∨,⊥,⊤,¬〉 is a Boolean algebra and 〈A,∧,∨,∼〉 is a <b>De</b> <b>Morgan</b> lattice. In this paper we prove that implicational classes of <b>De</b> <b>Morgan</b> Boolean algebras form a four-element chain and are all finitely-axiomatizable and finitely-generated quasivarieties, three of which are varieties.

40|$|AbstractThis {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with endomorphism monoids of <b>de</b> <b>Morgan</b> algebras. A construction is given of finite ordered sets with an order-inverting involution which are rigid; these correspond under duality to finite rigid <b>de</b> <b>Morgan</b> algebras. It can then be deduced that the variety of <b>de</b> <b>Morgan</b> algebras is universal, and, as a consequence, that for any given monoid M there is a proper class of non-isomorphic <b>de</b> <b>Morgan</b> algebras having M as endomorphism monoid. These conclusions contrast sharply with known results for Boolean algebras, which <b>de</b> <b>Morgan</b> algebras generalize: a Boolean algebra is uniquely determined by its endomorphism monoid...|$|R

50|$|Mary <b>De</b> <b>Morgan</b> {{was born}} in 1850 in London, UK. <b>De</b> <b>Morgan</b> was a {{successful}} Victorian Era children's short story writer. In her writing career, <b>De</b> <b>Morgan</b> developed three individual collections which started with On a Pincushion (1877), then The Necklace of Princess Fiorimonde (1880), and finally, The Windfairies (1900). The first two collections were successfully published by 1800 and {{her career as a}} Victorian Era writer continued to flourish. <b>De</b> <b>Morgan</b> aimed to create stories that recreated her brother's illustrations. Her focus was reading to young children her written works of short stories in the Victorian fairy-tale genres. Tragically, <b>De</b> <b>Morgan</b> died in Egypt in 1907.|$|R

The West Hill Library closed on 28 September 2007 and latterly, the <b>De</b> <b>Morgan</b> Foundation shared the building with Wandsworth Museum.

Evelyn De Morgan's art is notable for her rich use of colour and her emphasis on strong female protagonists. The <b>De</b> <b>Morgans</b> were involved in the social issues of the day such as women's suffrage, and this engagement was covered by the museum.|$|R
