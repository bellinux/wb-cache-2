40|$|Controlling and scrutinising {{government}} expenditure {{is an important}} duty of the New Zealand Parliament. There is an on-going debate {{on the effectiveness of}} Parliament in undertaking this. The role, inherited from the British Parliament, has been developed upon and refined by the New Zealand Parliament. Parliament holds the government to account for its expenditure through a system consisting of the Finance and Expenditure Committee, other subject select committees, extensive Budget and Estimates documentation, and <b>detailed</b> <b>appropriations.</b> The Controller and Auditor-General, debate in the House, and thorough accounts and accounting are also a part of the process. The New Zealand Parliament can have more than adequate control of {{government expenditure}}, but is sometimes deficient at scrutinising its details. Recommendations to improve Parliamentâ€™s ability to control and scrutinise government expenditure must centre on Members of Parliament being willing, able and eager to undertake the role...|$|E

50|$|Congress {{passed its}} budget {{resolution}} in May 2015. It {{was the first}} budget resolution successfully passed by Congress in over five years. Congressional budget resolutions are non-binding and largely symbolic, in that the actual spending levels are specified in much greater <b>detail</b> in the <b>appropriations</b> bills to be passed later in the year. The bill envisioned increasing military spending and decreasing social programs, {{with the goal of}} having a balanced budget by 2025. The passage of a budget resolution opened the way for budget reconciliation procedures to be used to repeal the Affordable Care Act on a simple majority vote, although a presidential veto of such legislation was expected.|$|R

In March Foulois worked with Major General George Squier, the Chief Signal Officer, and the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics to <b>detail</b> plans for <b>appropriations</b> of $54 million to support 16 aero squadrons, 16 balloon companies, and nine aviation schools. The French government requested the U.S. provide 4,500 trained pilots by the Spring of 1918, which would require 4,900 training aircraft and 12,000 combat planes. The appropriation signed on July 24, 1917, was for $640 Million, the largest for a single purpose in the history of Congress. On the same date, Foulois was promoted from major to the temporary rank of Brigadier General, to enable him to oversee this responsibility.|$|R
