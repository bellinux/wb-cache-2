5|$|Shortly {{before the}} wedding, Truman and Jacobson opened a <b>haberdashery</b> {{together}} at 104 West 12th Street in downtown Kansas City. After brief initial success, the store went bankrupt {{during the recession}} of 1921. Truman did not pay off {{the last of the}} debts from that venture until 1934, when he did so {{with the aid of a}} political supporter. Jacobson and Truman remained close friends, and Jacobson's advice to Truman on Zionism later played a role in the U.S. government's decision to recognize Israel.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his deformities, {{at some point during}} his childhood, Merrick suffered a fall and damaged his left hip. This injury became infected and left him permanently lame. Although affected by his physical deformities, Merrick attended school and enjoyed a close relationship with his mother. She was a Sunday school teacher, and his father worked as an engine driver at a cotton factory, as well as running a <b>haberdashery</b> business. On 29 May 1873, less than three years after the death of her youngest son William, Mary Jane Merrick died from bronchopneumonia. Joseph Rockley Merrick moved with his two children to live with Mrs. Emma Wood Antill, a widow with children of her own. They married on 3 December 1874.|$|E
5|$|Merrick was {{becoming}} a greater financial burden on his family and eventually, his father secured him a hawker's licence which enabled him to earn money selling items from the <b>haberdashery</b> shop, door to door. This endeavour was unsuccessful, since Merrick's facial deformities rendered his speech increasingly unintelligible and prospective customers reacted with horror to his physical appearance. Housewives refused to open doors for him and now people not only stared at him but began to follow him out of curiosity. Merrick failed to make enough money as a hawker to support himself. On returning home one day in 1877, he was severely beaten by his father and he left home for good.|$|E

5|$|Women in Mediaeval and Renaissance Europe were legally {{assumed to}} be subject to their fathers, then to their husbands after marriage. The status of women within Mediaeval trades was largely {{dependent}} on the local interpretation of femme sole, the legal term for a single woman. This was usually the widow of a tradesman, who was permitted to continue her husband's business after his death, and often established in the rights and privileges of his trade guild or company. More rarely, single women would achieve success in their father's trade. Exceptions occurred mainly in trades linked to traditional women's occupations, such as <b>haberdashery</b> and needlecraft.|$|E
5|$|The {{shopping}} center {{is expected to}} include Bebe, Coach and J.Crew. Lettuce Entertain You who also operates the food court at Water Tower Place will operate a cafe, food court and market. The top floor was to be occupied by Muvico Theaters, however they pulled out in 2009. The David Barton Gym, the first and largest tenant of the Block 37 project, has {{pulled out of the}} project favoring, instead, the Roosevelt Collection in the south loop. The reason the gym opted out was the delayed opening of the mall, which is scheduled for fall 2009 opening rather than fall 2008 as scheduled. In March 2009, Apple Inc. also withdrew from its leasing agreement, and less than a month later it signed an agreement to develop a new storefront in the Clybourn Corridor on property bounded by North Avenue, Halsted Street and Clybourn Avenue. After Apple backed out of its lease, Lululemon backed out of its lease to be located next to Apple. Other March 2009 tenant signings included Chicago's <b>haberdashery</b> Bigsby & Kruthers, Sunglass Hut, crystal jewelers Swarovski, Starfruit Cafe, and Fast-casual eatery Tahini. Also, in the face of declining advertising revenue, CBS sought to sublease part of its studio. A Loews Hotel will be built in forthcoming years.|$|E
5|$|While {{active as}} a runner, Nurmi {{was known to}} be secretive about his {{training}} methods. Always running alone, he upped his pace and quickly exhausted anyone who was bold enough to join him. Even his club mate Harri Larva had learned little from him. After ending his career, Nurmi became a coach for the Finnish Athletics Federation and trained runners for the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. In 1935, Nurmi along with the entire board of directors quit the federation after a heated 40–38 vote to resume athletic relations with Sweden. However, Nurmi returned to coaching three months later and the Finnish distance runners went on to take three gold medals, three silvers and a bronze at the Games. In 1936, Nurmi also opened a men's clothing store (<b>haberdashery)</b> in Helsinki. It became a popular tourist attraction, and Emil Zátopek was among those who visited the store trying to meet Nurmi. The Finn spent his time in the back room, running another new business venture; construction. As a contractor, Nurmi built forty apartment buildings in Helsinki with about a hundred flats in each. Within five years, he was rated a millionaire. His fiercest rival Ritola ended up living in one of Nurmi's flats, at half price. Nurmi also made money on the stock market, eventually becoming one of Finland's richest people.|$|E

A smaller {{version of a}} pleasure garden is a tea garden, where visitors may drink tea and stroll.|$|R
50|$|More than 80 {{percent of}} the Hainanese people traced their origins from Wenchang county. People from Hainan settled in Cambodia from the early 18th century under Mạc Cửu, who {{established}} a trading settlement that spanned modern-day Ha Tien, Kampot province and Sihanoukville. Early Hainanese settlers started off as entrepot traders but turned to pepper trading {{at the end of}} the 18th century. They established pepper plantations in Kampot, and became the dominant Chinese sub-group in that province. Smaller Hainanese communities are also found at Sisophon and Sre Ambel. In the 1950s, many Hainanese would then move to Phnom Penh, where, in the late 1960s, they monopolized the city's entire hotel and restaurant business. Hainanese of more humbler socioeconomic backgrounds operated tailor shops and <b>haberdasheries.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Argentine National Anthem {{was first}} {{performed}} in 1813 at the Florida Street home of Mariquita Sánchez de Thompson, {{one of the}} city's most prominent citizens. Argentine elites began to leave the central and southern wards of the city mainly due to epidemics, especially the 1871 yellow fever outbreak. They {{decided to move to}} higher ground in the city and chose the area known as Retiro. Florida Street, whose northern half is in the Retiro ward, became a shopping street in 1872, and would soon welcome pharmacies, furniture retailers, jewelers, and <b>haberdasheries</b> that offered the latest in European fashion. Numerous private mansions were also built along Florida Street in the 1880s and 1890s. The Parisian-inspired Bon Marché became the street's first large-scale shopping arcade in 1889, and the Argentine Jockey Club, the nation's most prestigious gentlemen's club and horse racing society, was inaugurated in 1897.|$|R
50|$|Lino {{has been}} {{involved}} with Al Bazar since at least the 1970s, when he was an employee. At this point, it was still a store selling mainly denim. At some point Lino took over the store and started to change its market, wanting the store to challenge famous <b>haberdasheries</b> like M. Bardelli, which was at that time the place to be for wealthy young men to buy their suits. He started to go out a lot, to famous Milanese clubs like Nepentha and Charlie Max, so as to get to know his proposed customers. Seeing as people still dressed up to go out in these days, this necessitated the need for smart clothing. This is why Lino started carrying jackets and popovers in his store. Through the years, this slowly shifted into the present-day offerings of the store, consisting solely of items Lino likes and wears himself. He has been quoted with saying 'We can't be appreciated by everyone. Hence it is useless to make a product hoping that everyone will enjoy it. It is almost impossible. For this reason, I sell what I like and wear everyday.' This philosophy is well reflected in Al Bazar.|$|R

"Tottleben, with {{no feeling}} other than Official {{tempered}} by Human, was in great contrast with Lacy, and very beneficent to Berlin {{during the three}} days it lay under the TRIBULA, or harrow of War.

[...] Whom we shall see again helpful at Leipzig; a man worth marking in these tumults. [...] "If Tottleben was the temporal Armed King, this Gotzkowsky was the Spiritual King, PAPA or Universal Father, armed only with charities, pieties, prayers, ever shiningly attended by self-sacrifices on Gotzkowsky's part; which averted woes innumerable (Lager-Haus only one of a long list); and which 'surpassed all belief,' write the Berlin Magistracy, as if in tears over such heroism. Truly a Prince of Merchants, this Gotzkowsky, not for his vast enterprises, and the mere 1,500 workmen he employs, but for the still greater heart that dwells in him. Had begun as a travelling Pedler; used to call at Reinsberg, with female <b>haberdasheries</b> exquisitely chosen ('GALLANTERIE wares' the Germans call them), for the then Princess Royal; not unnoticed by Friedrich, who recognized the broad sense, solidity and great thoughts of the man. Of all which Friedrich has known far more since then, in various branches of Prussian commerce improved by Gotzkowsky's managements.

25|$|Siegel {{was born}} in Cleveland, Ohio, the {{youngest}} of six children of Jewish immigrants from the Russian Empire, a part which later became Lithuania, Sarah (née Fine) and Mitchell Siegel (né Mikhel Segalovich). He was preceded by sisters Minerva and Roslyn, both in Lithuania, brothers Harry and Leo, and sister Isabel. His father was a sign painter who opened a <b>haberdashery</b> and encouraged his son's artistic inclinations. Mitchell {{died of a heart}} attack brought on by the robbery of his store, when Jerry was in junior high school. Siegel was a fan of movies, comic strips, and especially science fiction pulp magazines. He became active in a fandom, corresponding with other science fiction fans, including the young future author Jack Williamson. In 1929, Siegel published what might have been the first science-fiction fanzine, Cosmic Stories, which he produced with a manual typewriter and advertised in the classified section of Science Wonder Stories. He published several other booklets over the next few years.|$|E

60|$|Our friends {{threaded}} {{their way}} {{slowly through the}} throngs upon the bridge. This structure, which had stood for six hundred years, and had been a noisy and populous thoroughfare all that time, was a curious affair, for a closely packed rank of stores and shops, with family quarters overhead, stretched along both sides of it, from one {{bank of the river}} to the other. The Bridge was a sort of town to itself; it had its inn, its beer-houses, its bakeries, its <b>haberdasheries,</b> its food markets, its manufacturing industries, and even its church. It looked upon the two neighbours which it linked together--London and Southwark--as being well enough as suburbs, but not otherwise particularly important. It was a close corporation, so to speak; it was a narrow town, of a single street a fifth of a mile long, its population was but a village population and everybody in it knew all his fellow-townsmen intimately, and had known their fathers and mothers before them--and all their little family affairs into the bargain. It had its aristocracy, of course--its fine old families of butchers, and bakers, and what-not, who had occupied the same old premises for five or six hundred years, and knew the great history of the Bridge from beginning to end, and all its strange legends; and who always talked bridgy talk, and thought bridgy thoughts, and lied in a long, level, direct, substantial bridgy way. It was just the sort of population to be narrow and ignorant and self-conceited. Children were born on the Bridge, were reared there, grew to old age, and finally died without ever having set a foot upon any part of the world but London Bridge alone. Such people would naturally imagine that the mighty and interminable procession which moved through its street night and day, with its confused roar of shouts and cries, its neighings and bellowing and bleatings and its muffled thunder-tramp, was the one great thing in this world, and themselves somehow the proprietors of it. And so they were, in effect--at least they could exhibit it from their windows, and did--for a consideration--whenever a returning king or hero gave it a fleeting splendour, for there was no place like it for affording a long, straight, uninterrupted view of marching columns.|$|R
500|$|Truman {{was born}} in Lamar, Missouri, {{and spent most of}} his youth on his family's 600-acre farm near Independence. In the last months of World War I, he served in combat in France as an {{artillery}} officer with his National Guard unit. After the war, he briefly owned a <b>haberdashery</b> in Kansas City, Missouri, and joined the Democratic Party and the political machine of Tom Pendergast. Truman was first elected to public office as a county official in 1922, and then as a U.S. Senator in 1934. [...] He gained national prominence as chairman of the Truman Committee, formed in March 1941, which aimed to find and correct problems such as waste and inefficiency in Federal Government wartime contracts.|$|E

In 1864, he turned down Robinson's offer of a partnership, and rented his own premises {{on the north side of}} Oxford Street, on part of the site now occupied by the department store which bears his name. There he sold silk and woollen cloth and <b>haberdashery.</b> His retailing philosophy was to buy good quality merchandise and sell it at a modest 'mark up'. Although he carried a wide range of merchandise, he didn’t bother much about displaying it, and never advertised. His skill lay in sourcing the goods he sold, and most mornings he would go to the City, accompanied by a man with a hand barrow. Later he would make trips to Paris to buy silks.|$|E
2500|$|Blake {{returned}} to London in 1804 {{and began to}} write and illustrate Jerusalem (1804–20), his most ambitious work. Having conceived the idea of portraying the characters in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, Blake approached the dealer Robert Cromek, {{with a view to}} marketing an engraving. Knowing Blake was too eccentric to produce a popular work, Cromek promptly commissioned Blake's friend Thomas Stothard to execute the concept. When Blake learned he had been cheated, he broke off contact with Stothard. He set up an independent exhibition in his brother's <b>haberdashery</b> shop at 27 Broad Street in Soho. The exhibition was designed to market his own version of the Canterbury illustration (titled The Canterbury Pilgrims), along with other works. As a result, he wrote his Descriptive Catalogue (1809), which contains what Anthony Blunt called a [...] "brilliant analysis" [...] of Chaucer and is regularly anthologised as a classic of Chaucer criticism. It also contained detailed explanations of his other paintings. The exhibition was very poorly attended, selling none of the temperas or watercolours. Its only review, in The Examiner, was hostile.|$|E

Its customers included not only royalty, such as Alfonso XIII of Spain (warrant granted in 1913); Edward VIII, duke of Windsor; the French president Paul Deschanel, noted for his elegant Charvet cravats; but also members of the high society gravitating around dandies such as Robert de Montesquiou and Evander Berry Wall, or artists as Jean Cocteau, who called Charvet [...] "magic" [...] and wrote that it is [...] "where the rainbow finds ideas", and his friend Sergei Diaghilev. According to Proust, whose shirts, ties and waistcoats were from Charvet, maybe by imitation of Montesquiou, the latter was [...] "the sign of a certain world, of a certain elegance". Proust also spent long moments at Charvet {{in search of a}} perfect tone for his cravats, such as a [...] "creamy pink". His tank tops ( [...] in French) also came from Charvet. In his Remembrance of Things Past (1919), Marcel, the narrator, waiting for the appointed hour of his lunch engagement at Swann's house, whiles away his time [...] "tightening from time to time the knot of [...] magnificent Charvet tie".
