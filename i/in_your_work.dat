While some religious institutes encourage their members to withdraw from the material world, Opus Dei exhorts its members and all lay Catholics to [...] "find God in daily life" [...] and to perform their work excellently as a service to society and as a fitting offering to God. Opus Dei teaches that work not only contributes to social progress but is [...] "a path to holiness", and its founder advised people to: [...] "Sanctify your work.

500|$|Interviewed in January 2006, Chambers foreshadowed major {{developments}} for his character when he stated: [...] "I think Sam's ideal woman might be Connie because she's feisty, doesn't beat around {{the bush and}} is very talented, which is always sexy. However I reckon they clash quite a lot because she manipulates with her power play and won't drop the act {{so it would be}} very much on a love hate basis." [...] The two characters went on to have a brief sexual relationship, resulting in Connie becoming pregnant with Sam's child. Once the revelation of Connie's pregnancy had been made, Chambers asserted of the tension between the separated couple: [...] "Some of the scenes with Connie work amazingly well because we do genuinely get worked up and we like {{to keep it that way}} until filming is finished. It's a useful tip to let the frustrations come through <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>work</b> - it makes good viewing." ...|$|E

500|$|Gyllenhaal's {{break-out}} {{role was}} in the black comedy, Secretary (2002), a film about two people who embark on a mutually fulfilling BDSM lifestyle. The New York Times critic Stephen Holden noted: [...] "The role of Lee, which Maggie Gyllenhaal imbues with a restrained comic delicacy and sweetness, should make her a star." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote: [...] "Maggie Gyllenhaal, as the self-destructive secretary, is enigmatic and, at moments, sympathetic." [...] The film received generally favorable reviews, and Gyllenhaal's performance earned her the Best Breakthrough Performance by an Actress award from the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures, her first Golden Globe nomination, and an Independent Spirit Award nomination. Secretary was Gyllenhaal's first film role which featured full frontal nudity. Although impressed with the script, she initially had some qualms about doing the film, which she believed could deliver an anti-feminist message. Yet after carefully discussing the script with the film's director, Steven Shainberg, she agreed to join the project. Although insisting Shainberg did not exploit her, Gyllenhaal has said she felt [...] "scared when filming began" [...] and that [...] "in the wrong hands... even in just slightly less intelligent hands, this movie could say something really weird." [...] Since then, she is guarded about discussing {{her role in the}} film, saying only that [...] "despite myself, sometimes the dynamic that you are exploring <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>work</b> spills over into your life." ...|$|E

It's not a sign of creativity to have 65 ideas for one problem, that's just a waste of energy. I also don't think you need to go anywhere particular to be creative; people just use that as an excuse. But I do think a lot of creativity depends on your relationships with other people, your personal relationships, your partner or whatever.
