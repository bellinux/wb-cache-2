500|$|In April2011, it was {{reported}} that Masood would kidnap Yusef, pour petrol on him and threaten to set him on fire. Yusef will then go to the Masood's house and tell Zainab what Masood has done. An EastEnders insider told the News of the World, [...] "Masood has never got over that. Tension has been simmering for a while and leads to an outpouring of violence from Masood that leaves Yusef seriously injured. But Yusef will get his own back. It is a twisted love triangle that will also show the sometimes brutal side of arranged marriages. It's not clear if their marriage will survive Yusef's meddling. [...] Yusef obviously wants [...] back and will do anything he can to drive a wedge between Masood and Zainab." [...] Ganatra said that Yusef will turn [...] "very manipulative and very nasty" [...] and Masood finds him as a big threat saying, [...] "He throws a real spanner in the works for Masood. [...] He is doing <b>everything</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> to wreck Masood's life, really, and the way you do that is to get to his family. It's a very clever way of doing things—it's not about destroying his family, it's about winning his family and turning them against him, so that Masood is left isolated and on his own." [...] Ganatra spoke of the storyline saying, [...] "I think there's rumours of revenge! Yusef is a really nice catalyst - he's a very exciting character to throw into the mix. If it goes that way, it's more drama for us to play." [...] The scenes were broadcast on 2June2011 with Phil Mitchell also taking revenge alongside Masood.|$|E

He often berates Bart, but the two commonly share adventures and are sometimes allies; some episodes, particularly in later seasons, show that the pair have a strange respect for each other's cunning. Homer and Lisa have opposite personalities and he usually overlooks Lisa's talents, but when made aware of his neglect, does <b>everything</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> to help her. While Homer's thoughtless antics often upset his family, he on many occasions has also revealed himself to be a very caring and loving father and husband: in [...] "Lisa the Beauty Queen", (season four, 1992) he sold his cherished ride on the Duff blimp and used the money to enter Lisa in a beauty pageant so she could feel better about herself; in [...] "Rosebud", (season five, 1993) he gave up his chance at wealth to allow Maggie to keep a cherished teddy bear, despite the show also occasionally implying Homer forgets he has a third child, while the episode [...] "And Maggie Makes Three" [...] suggests she is the chief reason Homer took and remains at his regular job (season six, 1995); in [...] "Radio Bart", (season three, 1992) he spearheaded an attempt to dig Bart out after he had fallen down a well; and in [...] "A Milhouse Divided", (season eight, 1996) he arranged a surprise second wedding with Marge to make up for their unsatisfactory first ceremony. Homer, however, has a poor relationship with his father Abraham [...] "Grampa" [...] Simpson, whom he placed in a nursing home as soon as he could. The Simpson family will often do their best to avoid unnecessary contact with Grampa, but Homer has shown feelings of love for his father from time to time.|$|E

Chrissie had previously been pursuing a possible romance with Sacha, so his arrival [...] "put a spanner in the works". Astill predicted that Holby City fans would take a disliking to Dan, after he ruins any chance of reconciliation between Chrissie and Sacha.

Cortese was at first uncomfortable with the storyline, stating; [...] "I was very worried about the age difference but the way it's been done and written is really respectful." [...] Cortese also believed despite the age difference, Dom was truly in love with Delphi; [...] "Dom sees Delphi as his soul mate, she affects {{him in a way}} no one has before because he's always been suspicious of relationships. He doesn't have to pretend to be anyone else for her to like him." [...] Producer Harriet Crampton enjoyed the romance and how it contrasted with Dom's evil character, stating; [...] "To have a villain who has a strong sincere love or passion makes you think, ‘Okay, he’s an absolute bastard but we know he does love Delphi." [...] The two first get together when Delphi turns 16, sharing a kiss. The two eventually start a relationship but break up when Dom comes under question of Geoff's murder in arguably one of the soap's most memorable storylines. Dom flees when Delphi confronts him about the murder but later returns, with Cortese suggesting it was for love; [...] "But the thing about Dominic is he believes he's doing everything for the right reasons. He's done <b>everything</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> for Delphi— that's his main reason for coming back." [...] Dom later scares Delphi into fleeing the country, ending the once seemingly perfect relationship.|$|E
