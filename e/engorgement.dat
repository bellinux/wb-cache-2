5|$|Drugs {{may cause}} or affect {{clitoral}} priapism. The drug trazodone {{is known to}} cause male priapism as a side effect, but {{there is only one}} documented report that it may have caused clitoral priapism, in which case discontinuing the medication may be a remedy. Additionally, nefazodone is documented to have caused clitoral <b>engorgement,</b> as distinct from clitoral priapism, in one case, and clitoral priapism can sometimes start as a result of, or only after, the discontinuation of antipsychotics or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).|$|E
5|$|The blood shift causes an {{increased}} respiratory and cardiac workload. Stroke volume is not greatly affected by immersion or variation in ambient pressure, but slowed heartbeat reduces the overall cardiac output, particularly {{because of the}} diving reflex in breath-hold diving. Lung volume decreases in the upright position, owing to cranial displacement of the abdomen from hydrostatic pressure, and {{resistance to air flow}} in the airways increases because of the decrease in lung volume. There appears to be a connection between pulmonary edema and increased pulmonary blood flow and pressure, which results in capillary <b>engorgement.</b> This may occur during higher intensity exercise while immersed or submerged.|$|E
5|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging is less effective than CT at directly imaging sites of CSF leak. MRI studies may show pachymeningeal enhancement (when the dura mater looks thick and inflamed), sagging of the brain, pituitary enlargement, subdural hygromas, <b>engorgement</b> of cerebral venous sinuses, and other abnormalities. For 20% of patients, MRIs present as completely normal. There is disagreement over whether MRI {{should be the}} study of choice. MRIs performed with the patient seated upright (vs. laying supine) are not better for diagnosing CSF leaks, but are {{more than twice as}} effective at diagnosing cerebellar tonsillar ectopia, also known as Chiari malformation. Cerebellar tonsillar ectopia shares many of the same symptoms as CSF leak, but originates either congenitally or from trauma, including whiplash strain to the dura.|$|E

25|$|Once {{attached}} the female draws blood and gradually swells. In typical warmer weather conditions the initial <b>engorgement</b> is slow but after {{four or more}} days it becomes very rapid. The rapid <b>engorgement</b> phase is also associated with the greatest injection of the toxic saliva.|$|E
25|$|When {{the breast}} overfills with milk it becomes painful. <b>Engorgement</b> comes from {{not getting enough}} milk from the breast. It happens about 3 to 7 days after {{delivery}} and occurs more often in first time mothers. The increased blood supply, the accumulated milk and the swelling all contribute to the painful <b>engorgement.</b> <b>Engorgement</b> may affect the areola, {{the periphery of the}} breast or the entire breast, and may interfere with breastfeeding both from the pain and also from the distortion of the normal shape of the areola/nipple. This makes it harder for the baby to latch on properly for feeding. Latching may occur over only part of the areola. This can irritate the nipple more, and may lead to ineffective drainage of breast milk and more pain. <b>Engorgement</b> may begin as a result of several factors such as nipple pain, improper feeding technique, infrequent feeding or infant-mother separation.|$|E
25|$|Secondary {{lactation}} failure: {{milk production}} that is low due to preventable factors, such as formula supplementation, poor milk transfer by the baby, or unrelieved breast <b>engorgement.</b>|$|E
25|$|The most {{frequent}} adverse events reported while using the Ortho Evra / Evra patch were: breast discomfort, <b>engorgement</b> or pain (22%), headache (21%), application site reaction (17%), nausea (17%), {{upper respiratory tract}} infection (10%), menstrual cramps (10%), and abdominal pain (9%).|$|E
25|$|In {{the middle-aged}} woman, breast ptosis usually {{is caused by}} the {{postpartum}} hormonal changes to the maternal body, which depleted the quantity of adipose fat tissue and atrophied the milk glands, and because of the inelasticity of the skin envelope, which was overstretched by the <b>engorgement</b> of lactation.|$|E
25|$|Studying human {{sexual arousal}} has proved a {{fruitful}} {{way of understanding}} how men and women differ as genders {{and in terms of}} sexual orientation. A clinical measurement may use penile or vaginal photoplethysmography, where genital <b>engorgement</b> with blood is measured in response to exposure to different erotic material.|$|E
25|$|Methyltestosterone is or {{has been}} used in the {{treatment}} of delayed puberty, hypogonadism, cryptorchidism, and erectile dysfunction in males, and in low doses to treat menopausal symptoms (specifically for osteoporosis, hot flashes, and to increase libido and energy), postpartum breast pain and <b>engorgement,</b> and breast cancer in women.|$|E
25|$|DES (in tablets up to 5mg) was {{approved}} by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on September 19, 1941 for four indications: gonorrheal vaginitis, atrophic vaginitis, menopausal symptoms, and postpartum lactation suppression to prevent breast <b>engorgement.</b> The gonorrheal vaginitis indication was dropped when the antibiotic penicillin became available. From its very inception, the drug was highly controversial.|$|E
25|$|In {{three large}} {{clinical}} trials involving {{a total of}} 3,330 women using the Ortho Evra / Evra patch for up to one year, 12% of users discontinued the patch because of adverse events. The most frequent adverse events leading to patch discontinuation were: nausea and/or vomiting (2.4%), application site reaction (1.9%), breast discomfort, <b>engorgement</b> or pain (1.9%), headache (1.1%), and emotional lability (1.0%).|$|E
25|$|In 1978, the FDA removed {{postpartum}} lactation suppression {{to prevent}} breast <b>engorgement</b> from their approved indications for DES and other estrogens. In the 1990s, the only approved indications for DES were treatment of advanced prostate cancer {{and treatment of}} advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women. The last remaining U.S. manufacturer of DES, Eli Lilly, stopped making and marketing it in 1997.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} images all {{depict the}} adult female of Ixodes holocyclus. Colour and markings change markedly as <b>engorgement</b> progresses. It {{is the third}} tick, the moderately engorged adult female (width, at level of the spiracles, more than 4mm) which is most commonly removed from dogs with tick venomning. If the fully engorged tick were found on a dog it suggests that the dog has a degree of immunity.|$|E
25|$|The Bartholin's glands, {{located near}} the vaginal opening, were {{originally}} considered the primary source for vaginal lubrication, but further examination showed that they provide only {{a few drops of}} mucus. The significant majority of vaginal lubrication is now believed to be provided by plasma seepage from the vaginal walls, which is called vaginal transudation. Vaginal transudation, which initially forms as sweat-like droplets, is caused by vascular <b>engorgement</b> of the vagina (vasocongestion), resulting in the pressure inside the capillaries increasing the transudation of plasma through the vaginal epithelium.|$|E

25|$|Primary anorgasmia is a {{condition}} where one has never experienced an orgasm. This is significantly more common in women, although it can occur in men who lack the gladipudendal (bulbocavernosus) reflex. Women with this condition can sometimes achieve a relatively low level of sexual excitement. Frustration, restlessness, and pelvic pain or a heavy pelvic sensation may occur because of vascular <b>engorgement.</b> On occasion, {{there may be no}} obvious reason why orgasm is unobtainable. In such cases, women report that they are unable to orgasm even if they have a caring, skilled partner, adequate time and privacy, and an absence of medical issues which would affect sexual satisfaction.|$|E
25|$|Growth of spermatogenic {{tissue in}} testicles, male fertility, penis or {{clitoris}} enlargement, increased libido {{and frequency of}} erection or clitoral <b>engorgement.</b> Growth of jaw, brow, chin, nose, and remodeling of facial bone contours, in conjunction with human growth hormone. Completion of bone maturation and termination of growth. This occurs indirectly via estradiol metabolites and hence more gradually in men than women. Increased muscle strength and mass, shoulders become broader and rib cage expands, deepening of voice, growth of the Adam's apple. Enlargement of sebaceous glands. This might cause acne, subcutaneous fat in face decreases. Pubic hair extends to thighs and up toward umbilicus, development of facial hair (sideburns, beard, moustache), loss of scalp hair (androgenetic alopecia), increase in chest hair, periareolar hair, perianal hair, leg hair, armpit hair.|$|E
25|$|Most mammals such as calves, sheep, goats, foals, pigs, cats, cavies, rats, {{mice and}} humans can be infested by the Australian Paralysis Tick. Fatalities {{resulting}} from a single engorged adult female tick are mostly reported in the young animals of the larger species and all ages and sizes of the pet species (dogs and cats). Larvae and nymphs can also produce toxic reactions in the host. Fifty larvae or five nymphs can kill a 40g rat, larger numbers of either can induce paralysis in dogs and cats. They can be quite easy to find on short-haired animals, but very difficult to find on long-haired animals like Persian cats. If {{you live in a}} tick-prone area, and your pets are allowed outdoors, it is suggested that you physically check your pets daily for ticks. Unfortunately they are often not discovered until the tick is large enough to be felt. By this time the tick has subjected the animal to a large amount of toxins. One adult female can kill four susceptible rats during <b>engorgement.</b> Although it is not typical, an engorging adult female apparently can re-attach several times to different dogs.|$|E
25|$|The newly moulted adult female becomes {{increasingly}} active {{for the first}} 6–7 days and seeks a host. It attaches to the final host after 7–9 days (but possibly up to 77 days). After insemination by a male tick, or sometimes before, a female feeds on blood {{in order to gain}} the nutrients for the egg mass to mature. Adult females engorge for a period of 6–30 days, the time again being temperature dependent. (The 30-day <b>engorgement</b> time is derived from laboratory culture colonies.) Under natural conditions, the time taken for an adult female to engorge while on the host varies from 6 to 21 days, the period being longest in cool weather. When fully engorged (replete), the adult female drops off the host to the ground. After 11–20 days the gravid female starts to lay a batch of 2000 to 6000 eggs (20-200 eggs per day over 16–34 days) into moist vegetation such as leaf and branch litter, under the bark of trees and shrubs, or in foliage near the tips of branches. The eggs are attached as a mass utilising a wax-like substance. The female tick dies 1–2 days after egg laying is complete. Under laboratory conditions, female ticks have been kept alive for more than two years.|$|E
25|$|Volvulus of {{the large}} colon usually occurs where the {{mesentery}} attaches to the body wall, but may also occur at the diaphragmatic or sternal flexures, with rotations up to 720 degrees reported. It is most commonly seen in postpartum mares, usually presents with severe signs of colic that are refractory to analgesic administration, and horses often lie in dorsal recumbency. Abdominal distention is common due to strangulation and rapid <b>engorgement</b> of the intestine with gas, which then can lead to dyspnea as the growing bowel pushes against the diaphragm and prevents normal ventilation. Additionally, compression can place pressure on the caudal vena cava, leading to pooling of blood and hypovolemia. However, horses {{may not have a}} high heart rate, presumably due to increased vagal tone. Rectal palpation will demonstrate a severely gas distended colon, and the examiner {{may not be able to}} push beyond the brim of the pelvis due to the obstruction. The colon may be irreversibly damaged in as little as 3–4 hours from the initial time of the volvulus, so immediate surgical correction is required. The surgeon works to correct the volvulus and then removes any damaged colon. 95% of the colon may be resected, but often the volvulus damages more than this amount, requiring euthanasia. Plasma lactate levels can help predict survival rates, with an increased survival seen in horses with a lactate below 6.0mmol/L. Prognosis is usually poor, with a survival rate of approximately 36% of horses with a 360 degree volvulus, and 74% of those with a 270 degree volvulus, and a reoccurrence rate of 5–50%. Complications post-surgery include hypoproteinemia, endotoxic shock, laminitis, and DIC.|$|E
500|$|The {{vestibular}} bulbs {{are more}} closely related to the clitoris than the vestibule because of the similarity of the trabecular and erectile tissue within the clitoris and bulbs, and the absence of trabecular tissue in other genital organs, with the erectile tissue's trabecular nature allowing <b>engorgement</b> and expansion during sexual arousal. The vestibular bulbs lie close to the crura {{on either side of the}} vaginal opening; internally, they are beneath the labia majora. When engorged with blood, they cuff the vaginal opening and cause the vulva to expand outward. Though some texts state that they surround the vaginal opening, this does not appear to be the case and tunica albuginea does not envelop the erectile tissue of the bulbs. In Yang et al.'s assessment of the bulbs' anatomy, they conclude that the bulbs [...] "arch over the distal urethra, outlining what might be appropriately called the 'bulbar urethra' in women." ...|$|E
500|$|The body's {{physical}} arousal response (vaginal lubrication and <b>engorgement</b> of the clitoris {{in women}} and erection in men) occurs due to two separate pathways which normally work together: [...] and reflex. Arousal due to fantasies, visual input, or other mental stimulation is a psychogenic sexual experience, and arousal resulting from physical contact to the genital area is reflexogenic. In psychogenic arousal, messages travel {{from the brain}} via the spinal cord to the nerves in the genital area. The psychogenic pathway is served by the spinal cord at levels T11–L2. [...] Thus people injured above {{the level of the}} T11 vertebra do not usually experience psychogenic erection or vaginal lubrication, but those with an injury below T12 can. Even without these physical responses, people with SCI often feel aroused, just as uninjured people do. The ability to feel the sensation of a pinprick and light touch in the dermatomes for T11–L2 predicts how well the ability to have psychogenic arousal is preserved in both sexes. Input from the psychogenic pathway is sympathetic, {{and most of the time}} it sends inhibitory signals that prevent the physical arousal response; in response to sexual stimulation, excitatory signals are increased and inhibition is reduced. Removing the inhibition that is normally present allows the spinal reflexes that trigger the arousal response to take effect.|$|E

2500|$|The highly dynamic {{nature of}} growth cones {{allows them to}} respond to the {{surrounding}} environment by rapidly changing direction and branching in response to various stimuli. There are three stages of axon outgrowth, which are termed: protrusion, <b>engorgement,</b> and consolidation. [...] During protrusion, there is a rapid extension of filopodia and lamellar extensions along {{the leading edge of the}} growth cone. [...] <b>Engorgement</b> follows when the filopodia move to the lateral edges of the growth cone, and microtubules invade further into the growth cone, bringing vesicles and organelles such as mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. [...] Finally, consolidation occurs when the F-actin at the neck of the growth cone depolymerizes and the filopodia retract. [...] The membrane then shrinks to form a cylindrical axon shaft around the bundle of microtubules. [...] One form of axon branching also occurs via the same process, except that the growth cone “splits” during the <b>engorgement</b> phase. This results in the bifurcation of the main axon. An additional form of axon branching is termed collateral (or interstitial) branching;.Collateral branching, unlike axon bifurcations, involves the formation of a new branch from the established axon shaft and is independent of the growth cone at the tip of the growing axon. In this mechanism, the axon initially generates a filopodium or lamellipodium which following invasion by axonal microtubules can then develop further into a branch extending perpendicular from the axon shaft. Established collateral branches, like the main axon, exhibit a growth cone and develop independently of the main axon tip.|$|E
2500|$|If {{breastfeeding}} {{is suddenly}} stopped a woman's breasts {{are likely to}} become engorged with milk. [...] Pumping small amounts to relieve discomfort helps to gradually train the breasts to produce less milk. There is presently no safe medication to prevent <b>engorgement,</b> but cold compresses and ibuprofen may help to relieve pain and swelling. Pain should go away in one to five days. [...] If symptoms continue and comfort measures are not helpful a woman should consider the possibility that a blocked milk duct or infection may be present and seek medical intervention.|$|E
2500|$|To prevent [...] {{or treat}} <b>engorgement,</b> remove the milk from the breast, by breastfeeding, expressing or pumping. Gentle massage can help start the milk flow and so reduce the {{pressure}}. The reduced pressure softens the areola, perhaps even allowing the infant to feed. Warm water or warm compresses and expressing some milk before feeding {{can also help}} make breastfeeding more effective. Some researchers have suggested that after breastfeeding, mothers should pump and/or apply cold compresses to reduce swelling pain and vascularity even more. One published study suggested the use of [...] "chilled cabbage leaves" [...] applied to the breasts. Attempts to reproduce this technique met with mixed results. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or paracetamol (acetominophen) may relieve the pain.|$|E
2500|$|Ticks {{generally}} are obligate blood feeders. All active stages (larvae, nymphs and adults) require blood {{as a source}} of nutrition (except for a few Argasid genera in which the adult mouthparts are non-functional, i.e. Antricola, Otobius and Nothoaspis). Adults also require the blood for sperm or egg production. The feeding process of Ixodid ticks has first a slow phase for several days followed by a fast phase in the last 12–24 hours before detachment. There may be a tenfold increase in fed: unfed weights {{by the end of the}} slow phase, but there is an additional tenfold increase by the end of the final fast phase. Leaving the full <b>engorgement</b> as late as possible reduces the chances of detection and removal by the host. The process of feeding is called engorging. The hypostome has a groove along its dorsal surface forming a food canal (also known as the preoral canal) through which blood is drawn from the host and passed on to the mouth and pharynx. During blood feeding by Ixodid ticks, the liquid portion of the meal is first concentrated by removal of water and excess ions, which move across the gut epithelium and enter the ticks body cavity (hemocoele). These components are then taken up by the salivary glands which produce a watery saliva that is injected back into the host ...|$|E
2500|$|Women use breast pumps {{for many}} reasons. Many women use breast pumps to {{continue}} breastfeeding after {{they return to}} work. They use the pump to express breast milk, which is later bottle fed to their child by a caregiver. A breast pump may {{also be used to}} stimulate lactation for women with a low milk supply or those who have not just given birth. However, {{it is important to note}} that the amount of milk a woman is able to pump should not be compared to how much milk a baby can get; efficiency greatly varies. A breast pump may be used to relieve <b>engorgement,</b> a painful condition whereby the breasts are overfull, possibly preventing a proper latch by the infant. A mother may also choose to pump exclusively if her baby does not latch properly, is hospitalized after birth, or cannot nurse for physical reasons (such as cleft palate). If the mother needs to take medication that affects the breast milk and may be harmful to the infant, which is a very rare instance, the mother may [...] "pump and dump" [...] the breast milk to keep up her milk supply during the time period that she is on the medication and may resume nursing after the course of medication is completed. Pumping may be desirable to continue lactation and its associated hormones to aid in recovery from pregnancy even if the pumped milk is not used.|$|E

Possibly his resentment at his customers' selfish {{abandonment}} of him at this moment developed a vague spirit of opposition to them and mitigated his feeling towards 'Lige. He groped {{his way to the}} counter, struck a match, and lit a candle. Its feeble rays faintly illuminated the pale, drawn face of the applicant, set in a tangle of wet, unkempt, party-colored hair. It was not the face of an ordinary drunkard; although tremulous and sensitive from some artificial excitement, there was no <b>ENGORGEMENT</b> or congestion in the features or complexion, albeit they were morbid and unhealthy. The expression was of a suffering that was as much mental as physical, and yet in some vague way appeared unmeaning--and unheroic.|$|E
60|$|The true {{explanation}} apparently lies in {{the intimate}} sympathy which exists between the capillary circulation of {{the surface of the}} head and face, and that of the brain. On applying to Dr. J. Crichton Browne for information, he has given me various facts bearing on this subject. When the sympathetic nerve is divided {{on one side of the}} head, the capillaries on this side are relaxed and become filled with blood, causing the skin to redden and to grow hot, and at the same time the temperature within the cranium on the same side rises. Inflammation of the membranes of the brain leads to the <b>engorgement</b> of the face, ears, and eyes with blood. The first stage of an epileptic fit appears to be the contraction of the vessels of the brain, and the first outward manifestation is, an extreme pallor of countenance. Erysipelas of the head commonly induces delirium. Even the relief given to a severe headache by burning the skin with strong lotion, depends, I presume, on the same principle.|$|E
