He cited the ease in development of features like fluid simulation, copyright issues with the art and more unhindered possibilities as further reasons for not using it. Being used to the text-based graphics in roguelikes, he did not want graphical tilesets. The story-generation originated first from Armok, although present to some extent in dragslay.

5|$|When Leakey {{took the}} position, the {{organization}} had 12 tons of confiscated illegal ivory in its possession, {{which he was}} urged to sell in order to fund conservation efforts. Instead, he piled all of <b>it</b> <b>together</b> <b>and,</b> with Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, set it on fire. Ivory does not easily burn, but the choice to use fire rather than other means to destroy it was intentional as Leakey wanted the event to produce powerful images for the global media. To make the destruction spectacular, Leakey worked with a Hollywood special effects professional to devise an innovative pyrotechnics technique using jet fuel and flammable glue.|$|E
5|$|Byzantium looked {{impressive}} when Manuel died in 1180, {{having just}} celebrated the betrothal {{of his son}} Alexios II to {{the daughter of the}} king of France. Thanks to the diplomacy and campaigning of Alexios, John, and Manuel, the empire was a great power, economically prosperous, and secure on its frontiers; but there were serious problems as well. Internally, the Byzantine court required a strong leader to hold <b>it</b> <b>together,</b> <b>and</b> after Manuel's death stability was seriously endangered from within. Some of the foreign enemies of the Empire were lurking on the flanks, waiting for a chance to attack, in particular the Turks in Anatolia, whom Manuel had ultimately failed to defeat, and the Normans in Sicily, who had already tried but failed to invade the Empire on several occasions. Even the Venetians, the single most important western ally of Byzantium, were on bad terms with the empire at Manuel's death in 1180. Given this situation, it would have taken a strong Emperor to secure the Empire against the foreign threats it now faced, and to rebuild the depleted Imperial Treasury. But Manuel's son was a minor, and his unpopular regency government was overthrown in a violent coup d'état. This troubled succession weakened the dynastic continuity and solidarity on which the strength of the Byzantine state had come to rely.|$|E

25|$|It {{was only}} in the early 16th century that the modern idea of the galley slave became commonplace. Galley fleets as well as the size of {{individual}} vessels increase in size, which required more rowers. The number of benches could not be increased without lengthening hulls beyond their structural limits, and more than three oars per bench was not practicable. The demand for more rowers also meant that the relatively limited number of skilled oarsmen could not keep up with the demand of large galley fleets. It became increasingly common to man galleys with convicts or slaves, which required a simpler method of rowing. The older method of employing professional rowers using the alla sensile method (one oar per man, with two to three sharing the same bench) was gradually phased out in favor of rowing a scaloccio, which required less skill. A single large oar was used for each bench, with several rowers working <b>it</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> the number of oarsmen per oar rose from three up to five. In some very large command galleys, there could be as many as seven to an oar.|$|E

Emma {{says that he}} won't, that she'll help him fight <b>it</b> <b>together,</b> <b>and</b> that she still wants a future with him. But Hook tells her not to, that their future is now, and that he’s happy just to know that she has one, before going limp. Emma says that it's not enough for her. She holds him and cries, and then takes Excalibur and floods it with magic. In the diner, Merlin tells them it’s too late, and tendrils of darkness emerge from him as he is released from Excalibur (the darkness was what bound Merlin to the fragment of Excalibur). The dark tendrils re-emerge from Excalibur and flow into Killian's heart, bathing him in a golden light. Then, Hook vanishes and his name appears on the blade of Excalibur. Then, a burst of dark magic erupts from the blade of Excalibur, turning Emma into her present-day appearance, with white hair and a dark appearance, signifying the completion of her journey into darkness. At the same time, a flood of dark energy pours into the entrance of the Vault of the Dark One, and reforms into a cloaked Killian.|$|E

500|$|Charles Rosen, who unraveled {{this unique}} {{borrowing}} of a Beethovenian structure in Schubert's A major Sonata, has {{also referred to}} Schubert's departure from the former's style in this instance: [...] "Schubert moves with great ease within the form which Beethoven created. He has, however, considerably loosened what held <b>it</b> <b>together,</b> <b>and</b> stretched its ligaments unmercifully... the correspondence of part to whole has been considerably altered by Schubert, and explains why his large movements often seem so long, since they are being produced with forms originally intended for shorter pieces. Some of the excitement naturally goes out of these forms when they are so extended, but this is even a condition of the unforced melodic flow of Schubert's music". Rosen adds, however, that [...] "with the finale of the A major Sonata Schubert produced a work that is unquestionably greater than its model".|$|E

500|$|Regarding {{the society}} itself, like social {{institutions}} in general, Durkheim {{saw it as}} a set of social facts. Even more than [...] "what society is", Durkheim was interested in answering [...] "how is a society created" [...] and [...] "what holds a society together". In The Division of Labour in Society, Durkheim attempted to answer the question of what holds the society together. He assumes that humans are inherently egoistic, but norms, beliefs and values (collective consciousness) form the moral basis of the society, resulting in social integration. Collective consciousness is of key importance to the society, its requisite function without which the society cannot survive. Collective consciousness produces the society and holds <b>it</b> <b>together,</b> <b>and</b> at the same time individuals produce collective consciousness through their interactions. Through collective consciousness human beings become aware of one another as social beings, not just animals.|$|E

The New York Times called it a [...] "low-budget freak show/cult classic/cultural institution" [...] and considered the songs featured in the film to be [...] "catchy". Geoff Andrew of Time Out noted that the [...] "string of hummable songs gives it momentum, Gray's admirably straight-faced narrator holds <b>it</b> <b>together,</b> <b>and</b> a run on black lingerie takes care of almost everything else", rating it 4 out of 5 stars.

The event {{marked the first time}} the original line-up appeared on stage since 1978, and also featured reunions of the Who and Led Zeppelin.

This plan didn't work as he forecasted. [...] "We were going to use different vocalists on the album, guest vocalists, but it was so difficult getting <b>it</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> getting releases from their record companies. Glenn Hughes came along to sing on one track and we decided to use him on the whole album." ...|$|E

During the duo's performance, Brown vomited green-colored liquid onto the stage and Gaga. They then climbed atop a large mechanical bull with a pig's head and a ball gag inserted in its mouth, riding <b>it</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> simulating sex acts. Brown continued to vomit on Gaga and her white apron during their time atop the bull. She even inserted her fingers inside Gaga's throat making her regurgitate the black paint all over.

500|$|Creator Shonda Rhimes {{compared}} {{what she}} deemed the two [...] "most iconic {{moments of the}} season", describing how the season begins with Izzie lying in the prom dress on the bathroom, and ends with Cristina standing motionless in her wedding dress. Cast member Eric Dane described the impact his first scene in the season had on him, stating {{that it was a}} spectacular entrance: [...] "It was a brand new towel, which had a hard time staying together. So every time I put <b>it</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> let my hands go, it was almost like throwing caution to the wind." [...] Cast member Sara Ramirez noted {{that one of the most}} significant scene in the season was when Izzie and George [...] "have this beautiful moment when neither of them speaks, but they say so much and it was just so rich", describing how their interaction during the scene determined everything that would be developed for their arc later. Betsy Beers, however, noted that the most [...] "powerful" [...] scene in the season saw Cristina Yang and Preston Burke in the on-call room, talking about the future of their relationship: [...] "It's fascinating to see how their entire relationship changes and almost disintegrates in this one exchange". Beers and Rhimes expressed their desire to introduce Patrick Dempsey's passion of car racing in the series, although this ultimately did not occur during the season. [...] "Patrick loved it. He's always driving something new, always trying something out", stated the series creator, regarding Dempsey's response to the storyline.|$|E
500|$|Describing {{the tone}} of the season, Loeb said, [...] "When we first started talking about Daredevil, we promised that we were telling a story that was first a crime drama and then a superhero show. This is more of a {{psychological}} thriller. This speaks to when you think about what happened to Jessica and what sort of destroyed her life and how she tried to put <b>it</b> <b>together,</b> <b>and</b> then to have to confront the person who deconstructed her world, that’s a very powerful, emotional place to start from." [...] On approaching rape and trauma in the season, Rosenberg wanted to avoid actually showing rape, which she called [...] "lazy storytelling" [...] and often a way to [...] "spice up" [...] male characters, and preferred to just make the trauma a part of the characters' everyday lives rather than an [...] "issue" [...] for the season to tackle. When asked about the adult nature of the season, including the use of sex, Rosenberg explained that Marvel would only not allow showing nudity {{and the use of the}} word 'fuck' in the season. Regarding all of the social issues the season covered, such as [...] "issues of choice, interracial relationships, domestic violence, [...] issues of consent" [...] while also exploring [...] "feminism and being a woman in this world", Rosenberg said, [...] "It was never our intention going in , and I think the minute you intend to do that, you’re stepping up on a soap box. If you’re digging into the dark side of the human psyche and all the different experiences we go through, and as women we go through, you’re going to find those things. If you treat them honestly and with respect, you’re also going to hit social issues." ...|$|E
