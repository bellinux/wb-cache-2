5|$|El Hatillo has {{had five}} mayors through 2014. Mercedes Hernández de Silva {{was the first}} mayor of the municipality, serving from 1993 until 1996. Succeeding <b>her,</b> <b>Flora</b> Aranguen was Mayor from 1996 until 2000. That same year, Alfredo Catalán was elected mayor and reelected in 2004. On November 23, 2008 Myriam Do Nascimento was elected mayor. She served in that {{capacity}} until 2013, when David Smolansky succeeded her as mayor.|$|E

5000|$|Flora first {{shows up}} in the episode [...] "Eat Your Heart Out" [...] (February 28, 1966) as the new {{waitress}} in Mayberry who has a crush on Sheriff Andy Taylor, while Goober has a crush on <b>her.</b> <b>Flora's</b> infatuation with Sheriff Taylor complicates his relationship both with Goober and with Helen Crump until he is able to convince Flora that Goober is the fellow for <b>her.</b> Perhaps <b>Flora's</b> most memorable scenes are in [...] "Eat Your Heart Out" [...] where she swaps plates on two occasions to give a better portion to Andy, but in the end does the same thing to give Goober the bigger portion.|$|R
60|$|I had {{the sudden}} {{vision of a}} shabby, lonely little room {{at the other end}} of the town. It had grown {{intolerable}} to her restlessness. The mere thought of it oppressed <b>her.</b> <b>Flora</b> de Barral was looking frankly at her chance confidant.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{has been}} a great renewal of still older times," [...] said Margaret, [...] "to have Aunt Flora here. I hope you will get to know <b>her,</b> <b>Flora,</b> it is so like having mamma here," [...] and she looked in her sister's face as she spoke.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs Clennam, {{who responded}} with a {{constrained}} grace to Mrs Finching's good nature in being there at all, though her visit (before Arthur's unexpected arrival) was undoubtedly an act of pure good nature and no self-gratification, intimated that all the house was open to <b>her.</b> <b>Flora</b> rose and looked to Arthur for his escort. 'Certainly,' said he, aloud; 'and Affery will light us, I dare say.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Gertrude Whitney died in 1942, at age 67, and was interred next to {{her husband}} in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City.

60|$|Captain Bragg, then {{occupied}} in building Bungalow Lodge--Bragg, I say, {{living on the}} first floor, and entertaining sea-captains, merchants, and East Indian friends with his grand ship's plate, being disappointed in a project of marrying a director's daughter, {{who was also a}} second cousin once removed of a peer,--sent in a fury for Mrs. Cammysole, his landlady, and proposed to marry Flora off-hand, and settle four hundred a year upon <b>her.</b> <b>Flora</b> was ordered from the back-parlor (the ground-floor occupies the second-floor bedroom), and was on the spot made acquainted with the splendid offer which the first-floor had made her. She has been Mrs. Captain Bragg these twelve years.|$|E
60|$|Miss Schuyler was {{not quite}} satisfied, but she made no further comment, and there was much to occupy her attention. The {{bleached}} plain was bright with sunshine and rolled back into the distance under an arch of cloudless blue, while the crisp, clear air stirred her blood like an elixir. They swept up a rise and down it, the colour mantling in their faces, over the long hollow, and up a slope again, until, as the white grass rolled behind <b>her,</b> <b>Flora</b> Schuyler yielded to the exhilaration of swift motion, and, flinging off the constraint of the city, rejoiced in the springy rush of the mettlesome beast beneath her. Streaming white levels, {{the blue of the}} sliding sky, the kiss of the wind on her hot cheek, and the roar of hoofs, all reacted upon her until she laughed aloud when she hurled her half-wild broncho down a slope.|$|E
60|$|The morrow, however, brought no Flora. The {{agitation}} {{and distress}} {{of that day}} had broken her down completely, {{and she was so}} ill as to be unable to move. Her aunt went at once to see her, and finding that her presence at the Grange relieved some of Dr. May's anxieties, chiefly devoted herself to <b>her.</b> <b>Flora</b> was grateful and gentle, but as silent and impenetrable as ever, while day after day she lay on her couch, uncomplaining and undemonstrative, visited by her father, and watched over by her aunt and sister-in-law, who began to know each other much better, though Flora less than ever, in that deep fixed grief. She only roused herself to return her husband's affection, or to listen to the daily reports of Margaret. Poor George, he was very forlorn, though Meta did her best to wait on him, and he rode over twice a day to inquire at Stoneborough.|$|E

50|$|For years Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney {{supported}} the museum single-handedly, as did <b>her</b> daughter, <b>Flora</b> Whitney Miller, after her, and until 1961 its board was largely family-run. Flora Payne Whitney, {{served as a}} museum trustee, then as vice president. From 1942 to 1974 she was the museum's president and chairman after which she functioned as honorary chairman until her death in 1986. <b>Her</b> daughter, <b>Flora</b> Miller Biddle, served as its president until 1985. In 1999, her book The Whitney Women and the Museum They Made was published.|$|R

60|$|It {{had been}} settled {{that there should}} be dancing this evening--all the young ladies had wished it. Lothair danced with Lady Flora Falkirk, and her sister, Lady Grizell, was in the same quadrille. They moved about like young giraffes in an African forest, but looked bright and happy. Lothair liked his cousins; their {{inexperience}} and innocence, and the simplicity with which they exhibited and expressed their feelings, had in them something bewitching. Then the rough remembrance of his old life at Falkirk and its contrast with the present scene had in it something stimulating. They were his juniors by several years, but they were always gentle and kind to him; and sometimes it seemed he was the only person whom they, too, had found kind and gentle. He called his cousin, too, by her Christian name, and he was amused, standing by this beautiful giantess, and calling <b>her</b> <b>Flora.</b> There were other amusing circumstances in the quadrille; not the least, Lord St. Aldegonde dancing with Mrs. Campian. The wonder of Lady St. Aldegonde was only equalled by her delight.|$|E
60|$|There was no wind, {{the sun was}} hot, and the {{reflection}} of Red Rose's mast and rigging trembled on the shining sea. She rode at anchor in a quiet bay, near the woods that rolled down to the smooth white boulders. Dark firs checkered the fresh green of the beeches and the bronzy yellow of the new oak leaves. The tide flowed smoothly past the yacht, and across the strait a lonely cloud threw a soft blue shadow on the scarred face of a lofty crag. Now and then the echoes of a blasting shot rolled among the hills. Flora sat in the yacht's cockpit. She wore a pale yellow dress that harmonized with her brown eyes and hair. Wyndham lay on the counter, smoking a cigarette, and when she thought {{he did not see}} <b>her</b> <b>Flora</b> gave him a careful glance. After a few days at sea, Harry's face was getting brown and he was losing his jaded look, but he was thin and she did not like the way his mouth was set. He had been working hard for some time, and now he had taken a holiday the strain he had borne did not relax. Flora did not altogether understand this, because things were going well with Wyndhams'.|$|E
6000|$|What {{came next}} was a German family, the {{continental}} acquaintances {{of the wife}} of one of Fyne's colleagues in the Home Office. Flora of the enigmatical glances was dispatched to them without much reflection. As it was not considered absolutely necessary to take them into full confidence, they neither expected the girl to be specially cheerful nor were they discomposed unduly by the indescribable quality of her glances. The German woman was quite ordinary; there were two boys to look after; they were ordinary, too, I presume; and Flora, I understand, was very attentive to them. If she taught them anything {{it must have been}} by inspiration alone, for she certainly knew nothing of teaching. But it was mostly [...] "conversation" [...] which was demanded from <b>her.</b> <b>Flora</b> de Barral conversing with two small German boys, regularly, industriously, conscientiously, in order to keep herself alive in the world which held for her the past we know and the future of an even more undesirable quality--seems to me a very fantastic combination. But I believe it was not so bad. She was being, she wrote, mercifully drugged by her task. She had learned to [...] "converse" [...] all day long, mechanically, absently, as if in a trance. An uneasy trance it must have been! Her worst moments were when off duty--alone in the evening, shut up in her own little room, her dulled thoughts waking up slowly till she started into the full consciousness of her position, like a person waking up in contact with something venomous--a snake, for instance--experiencing a mad impulse to fling the thing away and run off screaming to hide somewhere.|$|E

60|$|Ethel felt {{confident}} that Flora {{would be very}} kind to her little sister-in-law, and yet one of those gleams of doubt crossed <b>her,</b> whether <b>Flora</b> would not be somewhat jealous of her own authority.|$|R
50|$|Her father, Charles Frederick Ashburnham Kelly, an Irish army officer, was {{employed}} by the East India Company in Lahore; <b>her</b> mother, <b>Flora</b> Boyd, was from Ireland. Kate had two siblings: Frederick W.D. and Mary Pauline.|$|R
60|$|And quiet it was {{in another}} hour--Gertrude walking with the nurses, Dr. May gone to his patients, {{and all the rest}} at Abbotstoke, except Richard and Margaret downstairs; and Ethel, who, while {{arranging}} her properties in her new room, had full leisure to lay out before herself the duties that had devolved on her and to grapple with them. She recalled the many counsels that she had received from Flora, and they sounded so bewildering that she wished it had been Conic sections, and then she looked at a Hebrew grammar that Norman had given her, and gave a sigh as she slipped it into the shelf of the seldom used. She looked about the room, cleared out the last piece of brown paper, and burned the last torn envelope, that no relic of packing and change might distress Margaret's eyes for order; then feeling at once desolate and intrusive, she sat down in Flora's fireside chair, opened her desk, and took out her last time-table. She looked at it for some minutes, laid it aside, and rising, knelt down. Again seating herself, she resumed her paper, took a blank one, ruled it, and wrote her rules for each hour of each day in the week. That first hour after breakfast, when hitherto she had been free, was one sacrifice; it must go now, to ordering dinner, seeing after stores, watching over the children's clothes, and the other nondescripts, which, happily for <b>her,</b> <b>Flora</b> had already reduced to method. The other loss was the spare time between the walk and tea; she must not spend that in her own room now, or there would be no one to sit with Margaret, or keep the little ones from being troublesome to her. Ethel had often had to give up this space before, when Flora went out in the evening, and she had seldom felt otherwise than annoyed. Give it up for good! that was the cure for temper, but it had been valuable as something of her own. She would have been thankful could she have hoped to keep regularly to her own rules, but that she knew was utterly improbable--boys, holidays, callers, engagements, Dr. May, would all conspire to turn half her days upside down, and Cocksmoor itself must often depend not only on the weather, but on home doings. Two or three notes she wrote at the foot of her paper.|$|E

It becomes apparent that <b>her</b> <b>flora</b> powers are less effective if the area is less natural or adaptable, as in the Realm of Doom. Blossom is very reminiscent of her voice actress with Gabor's mannerisms, penchant for the beautiful and fashionable, and even her signature accent.|$|E
50|$|When Flora confronts {{her mother}} about {{her desire to}} kill Ulysses, a {{shouting}} match erupts in which Flora comes to believe her mother does not love <b>her.</b> <b>Flora,</b> feeling hurt, declares that she will go home with her father. Ulysses writes a poem to explain Flora and her mother’s real emotions, but Flora’s mother kidnaps him before the poem can be read. Flora puts together a crack team to rescue Ulysses, who has already escaped, leaving Flora’s mother to read his poem. The cast reunites in the father’s apartment building where Flora’s cynical exterior is cracked for good as she realises her parents truly love her.|$|E
50|$|According to Garhwali folklore, Pyoli {{was a young}} maiden {{living in}} the forest. She was raised by animals and her first human contact was {{in the form of}} a prince who had lost his way during a hunting expedition. She tended after him and of course he fell in love with her. He persuaded her to marry him and {{accompany}} him to his palace. Although she loved the prince she started wilting away in the absence of a natural environment. No one could cure her and finally she died pining for <b>her</b> <b>flora</b> and fauna friends. Her last wish was that she should be buried among her friends. The prince took her to be buried at the place he had first met her. Some time later a pretty, yellow flower came out at the spot. This flower was named after the pretty nature-loving belle.|$|E
