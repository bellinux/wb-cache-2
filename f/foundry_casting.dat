50|$|In New York City, sculptors had {{a choice}} of either sending their bas-reliefs to a local foundry in other cities, or Roiné and the Weil's to be {{electrolytically}} cast. The cost between the two methods of reproduction were similar, {{but there was a}} dramatic difference in detail. Because of the nature of molten metal, <b>foundry</b> <b>casting</b> could reproduce detail down to a 100th of an inch. Electrolytic casting could reproduce detail down to the width of a molecule! For large reliefs, as for the sides of buildings or monuments, such detail was unnecessary. But for smaller reliefs - and for medals! - such minute relief was a blessing. Sculptors learned it gave a sharp, crisp edge to their reliefs which often improved the total appearance. They learned the mantra: “If it’s in the model - meaning even the tiniest detail - it’s in the medal.” That held true for plaques as well.|$|E

Attilio initially worked for the Roman Bronze <b>Foundry</b> <b>casting</b> some of Frederic Remington's later works. He later started his plaster mold and casting firm. A.

Attilio had several sons to include Orazio, Amedeo, Victor and James who worked in the family business through to the late 1980s. Their last work was for Stanley Bleifeld on his The Lone Sailor, Navy Memorial in Washington, DC. Among the works cast by Contini family are Prometheus in NYC, the Jefferson Memorial, the US Grant Memorial and the Fredrick Hart's portico for the National Cathedral Night, Their work can be seen in nearly every major US city. Among their clients were Paul Manship, Anna Huntington, Georg Lober, Laura Fraser, Richard Recchia and Donald DeLue. The firm worked with many notable public art sculptures including works by James Earle Fraser who worked closely with Attilio in the 1920s to create The End of the Trail. Cesare would later restore and create the molds for a re-installation of The End of the Trail at the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum.|$|E

40|$|In a <b>foundry</b> <b>casting</b> line, {{contaminants}} {{are released}} from a large area. Casting fumes include both volatile and particulate compounds. The volatile fraction contains hydrocarbons, whereas the particulate fraction mostly comprises a mixture of vaporized metal fumes. Casting fumes lower the air quality in foundries. The design of local ventilation for the casting area is a challenging task, {{because of the large}} casting area and convection plumes from warm moulds. A local ventilation solution for the mould casting area was designed and dimensioned with the aid of computational fluid dynamic (CFD) calculations. According to the calculations, the most efficient solution was a push–pull ventilation system. The prototype of the push–pull systemwas built and tested in actual operation at the foundry. The push flow was generated by a free plane jet that blew across the 10 m wide casting area towards an exhaust hood {{on the opposite side of}} the casting lines. The capture efficiency of the prototype was determined by the tracer gas method. The measured capture efficiencies with push jet varied between 40 and 80 %, depend-ing on the distance between the source and the exhaust. With the aid of the push flow, the average capture efficiency was increased from 40 (without jet) to 60 %...|$|E

40|$|The {{suitability}} of local quartz {{sand in the}} production of bath crucibles is a study that was carried out in order to impart overall strength on bath crucibles hence reduce breakages during fettling. Therefore this research constitutes a study to enhance the efficiency of production of bath crucibles by addition of quartz sand in slip preparation. The steps taken in the beneficiation of quartz sand for the production of bath crucibles are comminution which entails crushing and milling classification washing liquid dispersion sizing and reduction of iron content by magnetic separation. The slip contains materials like plastic clay feldspar kaolin talc sodium silicate water quartz sand etc. These were all milled in the ball mill for slip production casting and fettling glazing and sintering to get final bath crucibles as the end products. Quartz sand is used in a variety of products essentially as raw material for the <b>foundry</b> <b>casting</b> and glass industries and also in chemicals water filtration and ceramics the heat resistance nature of quartz sand makes it an excellent refractory substance for these industrial processes.

40|$|Abstract. Porosity in {{cast metals}} {{often leads to}} {{cracking}} of components due to stress concentration and leakage, and as the result, the castings need be repaired or rejected. Disharmony in casting process was resulting in porosity. Prediction of porosity in the casting is necessary as a step to avoid the waste products and reduce costs. But to ensure whether these predictions are accurate and precise, it is still necessary to validate the test trials and testing. This paper aims to provide early information when, where, and how large a defect occurs in particular <b>foundry</b> <b>casting</b> porosity on duralumin.
