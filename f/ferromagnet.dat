25|$|Finally, {{note that}} the winding number is closely related with the (2+1)-dimensional {{continuous}} Heisenberg <b>ferromagnet</b> equations and its integrable extensions: the Ishimori equation etc. Solutions of the last equations are classified by the winding number or topological charge (topological invariant and/or topological quantum number).|$|E
25|$|A <b>ferromagnet,</b> like a {{paramagnetic}} substance, has unpaired electrons. However, {{in addition}} to the electrons' intrinsic magnetic moment's tendency to be parallel to an applied field, there is also in these materials a tendency for these magnetic moments to orient parallel to each other to maintain a lowered-energy state. Thus, {{even in the absence of}} an applied field, the magnetic moments of the electrons in the material spontaneously line up parallel to one another.|$|E
5000|$|Below {{are some}} room-temperature {{anisotropy}} constants for cubic <b>ferromagnets.</b> The compounds involving [...] are ferrites, an important class of <b>ferromagnets.</b> In general the anisotropy parameters for cubic <b>ferromagnets</b> {{are higher than}} those for uniaxial <b>ferromagnets.</b> This {{is consistent with the}} fact that the lowest order term in the expression for cubic anisotropy is fourth order, while that for uniaxial anisotropy is second order.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a microscopic theory of F/S/F trilayers with metallic or insulating <b>ferromagnets.</b> The trilayer with metallic <b>ferromagnets</b> {{is controlled by}} the formation of non local pair correlations among the two <b>ferromagnets</b> which do not exist with insulating <b>ferromagnets.</b> The difference between the insulating and ferromagnetic models can be understood from lowest order diagrams. Metallic <b>ferromagnets</b> are controlled by non local pair correlations and the superconducting gap is larger if the ferromagnetic electrodes have a parallel spin orientation. Insulating <b>ferromagnets</b> are controlled by pair breaking and the superconducting gap is smaller if the ferromagnetic electrodes have a parallel spin orientation. The same behavior is found in the presence of disorder in the microscopic phase variables and also {{in the presence of a}} partial spin polarization of the <b>ferromagnets.</b> The different behaviors of the metallic and insulating trilayers may be probed in experiments.

40|$|An earlier {{theory of}} the quantum phase {{transition}} in metallic <b>ferromagnets</b> is revisited and generalized in three ways. It is shown that the mechanism {{that leads to a}} fluctuation-induced first-order transition in metallic <b>ferromagnets</b> with a low Curie temperature is valid, (1) irrespective of whether the magnetic moments are supplied by the conduction electrons or by electrons in another band, (2) for <b>ferromagnets</b> in the XY and Ising universality classes as well as for Heisenberg <b>ferromagnets,</b> and (3) for ferrimagnets as well as for <b>ferromagnets.</b> This vastly expands the class of materials for which a first-order transition at low temperatures is expected, and it explains why strongly anisotropic <b>ferromagnets,</b> such as UGe 2, display a first-order transition as well as Heisenberg magnets.

25|$|There {{are a few}} crystal structures, {{notably the}} {{perovskite}} structure, which exhibit ferroelectric behavior. This is analogous to ferromagnetism, in that, {{in the absence of}} an electric field during production, the ferroelectric crystal does not exhibit a polarization. Upon the application of an electric field of sufficient magnitude, the crystal becomes permanently polarized. This polarization can be reversed by a sufficiently large counter-charge, in the same way that a <b>ferromagnet</b> can be reversed. However, although they are called ferroelectrics, the effect is due to the crystal structure (not the presence of a ferrous metal).|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{low-energy}} effective theory of spinor condensate <b>ferromagnets</b> for the superfluid velocity and magnetization degrees of freedom. This effective theory describes {{the competition between}} spin stiffness and a long-ranged interaction between skyrmions, topological objects familiar from the theory of ordinary <b>ferromagnets.</b> We find exact solutions to the non-linear equations of motion describing neutral configurations of skyrmions and anti-skyrmions. These analytical solutions provide a simple physical picture for the origin of crystalline magnetic order in spinor condensate <b>ferromagnets</b> with dipolar interactions. We also point out the connections to effective theories for quantum Hall <b>ferromagnets.</b> Comment: 13 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
50|$|Earnshaw's theorem has no {{exceptions}} for non-moving permanent <b>ferromagnets.</b> However, Earnshaw's theorem {{does not necessarily}} apply to moving <b>ferromagnets,</b> certain electromagnetic systems, pseudo-levitation and diamagnetic materials. These can thus seem to be exceptions, though in fact they exploit {{the constraints of the}} theorem.|$|R

2500|$|In an antiferromagnet, {{unlike a}} <b>ferromagnet,</b> {{there is a}} {{tendency}} for the intrinsic magnetic moments of neighboring valence electrons to point in opposite directions. When all atoms are arranged in a substance so that each neighbor is [...] "anti-aligned", the substance is antiferromagnetic. Antiferromagnets have a zero net magnetic moment, meaning that no field is produced by them. Antiferromagnets are less common compared to the other types of behaviors and are mostly observed at low temperatures. In varying temperatures, antiferromagnets can be seen to exhibit diamagnetic and ferromagnetic properties.|$|E
2500|$|As stated above, many {{materials}} that contain d- or f-elements do retain unquenched spins. Salts {{of such elements}} often show paramagnetic behavior but at low enough temperatures the magnetic moments may order. It {{is not uncommon to}} call such materials 'paramagnets', when referring to their paramagnetic behavior above their Curie or Néel-points, particularly if such temperatures are very low or have never been properly measured. [...] Even for iron {{it is not uncommon to}} say that iron becomes a paramagnet above its relatively high Curie-point. In that case the Curie-point is seen as a phase transition between a <b>ferromagnet</b> and a 'paramagnet'. The word paramagnet now merely refers to the linear response of the system to an applied field, the temperature dependence of which requires an amended version of Curie's law, known as the Curie–Weiss law: ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explain the non {{monotonic}} temperature dependence of the self-consistent superconducting gap of ferromagnet/superconductor/ferromagnet (F/S/F) trilayers with weak <b>ferromagnets</b> in the parallel alignment (equivalent to F/S bilayers). We show that this is due to Andreev bound states that compete with the formation of a minigap. Using a recursive algorithm we discuss in detail the roles of various parameters (thicknesses of the superconductor and <b>ferromagnets,</b> relative spin orientation of the <b>ferromagnets,</b> exchange field, temperature, disorder, interface transparencies).
