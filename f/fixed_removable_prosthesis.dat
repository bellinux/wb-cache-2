40|$|The loss {{of teeth}} {{invariably}} {{is followed by}} the loss of soft tissue. There is a high incidence (91 %) of residual ridge deformity following anterior tooth loss reported in literature; the majority of these are Class III defects that require soft-tissue surgery to augment the ridge defects. Esthetic surgical replacement is difficult and unpredictable, particularly when papilla in the esthetic zone needs to be restored. One choice is a <b>fixed</b> <b>removable</b> <b>prosthesis</b> retained by an Andrews bar and sleeve system. The prosthesis is designed to meet the requirements for esthetics, comfort, phonetics, hygiene, and favorable stress distribution to the abutment and soft tissues. One of the major advantages of an Andrews's bridge over fixed prosthesis is that it can be removed by the patient for improved oral hygiene access.

The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the impact of oral rehabilitation with <b>fixed</b> versus <b>removable</b> <b>prostheses</b> with and without implants on Oral Health Related Quality of Life (OHRQoL) measured with OHIP- 49 for patients treated with radiation therapy and/or ablative surgery. The study cohort included 51 patients (35 males, 16 females) with a mean age of 66 years. A significant improvement in OHRQoL was demonstrated after oral rehabilitation with <b>fixed</b> and <b>removable</b> dental <b>prosthesis</b> for patients after radiation and/or ablative jaw surgery. Thirty-nine of the 43 patients improved oral health related quality of life after prosthetic rehabilitation. Twenty-four patients improved with more than 20 points. The oral rehabilitation resulted in better appearance and chewing function. No significant effect between <b>fixed</b> versus <b>removable</b> <b>prostheses</b> and no significant effect of implant on the OHIP-score. This may be explained by a limited sample size, a great variation between the included patients and the validity of the OHIP- 49 questionnaire measure to demonstrate patient-reported improvements or deterioration of a prosthetic treatment in this group of very functional compromised patients...|$|R

Methods and materialsA questionnaire was distributed to the dental technicians concerning the quality of written instructions in the work authorization form. Use of impression trays and materials for <b>fixed</b> and <b>removable</b> prosthodontics, were part of the questionnaire. Out of two hundred distributed questionnaires, 136 were received (response rate= 68 %). Using pre-determined grading criteria. ResultsThe findings showed that half of the written instructions were considered “clear”, out of which 34 % the technician had to seek clarification from the dentist concerning the written instructions which reveal inadequate prescription. The special tray was the most common choice of impression tray (53. 8 %) and the elastomers were the most common impression material used (71 %) for both <b>fixed</b> and <b>removable</b> prosthodontics.

40|$|PURPOSE To {{evaluate}} and compare crestal bone level changes and peri-implant status of implant-supported reconstructions in edentulous and partially dentate patients after {{a minimum of}} 5 years of loading.

Replacement of lost teeth by a <b>fixed</b> or <b>removable</b> <b>prosthesis</b> {{is considered to be a}} restitutio ad similem, while implants may provide a feeling of restitutio ad integrum. Implant prosthodontics means restoring function, aesthetics, and providing technology; biology and technology are combined. Placement of implants is a reconstructive, preprosthetic surgical intervention and is therefore different from most goals in oral surgery that consist of tooth extraction, treating infection and removing pathology from soft or hard tissues. Thus, implants are part of the final prosthetic treatment which encompasses functional, aesthetic and social rehabilitation. The patient's needs and functional status determine the goal of prosthetic treatment. Treatment outcomes in implant prosthodontics are survival of implants and prostheses, impact on physiological and psychological status, oral health-related impact on quality of life, and initial and maintenance costs.

Two major implant prosthesis designs are available: fixed implant-supported prostheses and implant-supported overdentures. Several factors affect the choice between <b>fixed</b> and <b>removable</b> implant <b>prostheses,</b> such as the interforaminal space, interjaw relationship, oral hygiene, cost, and patient preference [2]. Zani et al.

In this clinical case, an implant-supported overdenture that was delivered to rehabilitate the edentulous mandibular region following marginal mandibulectomy for treatment of mandibular gingival carcinoma was replaced by an implant-fixed prosthesis.

The implant placement protocols were diverse with variables {{including the use of}} surgical templates/guides, primary and/or secondary implant placement following autogenous bone grafting, and immediate and/or delayed implant loading; however, the majority of the studies reported on delayed implant placement following initial healing of the transported bone graft and delayed loading of the implant fixtures. Six studies reported primary implant placement (Fenlon et al. [19], Ch’ng et al. [20], Zou et al. [22], Burgess et al. [27], Wu et al. [30], Watzinger et al.

Additional procedures were also reported which include removal of reconstruction plates and screws at the time of implant placement, bone condensing to enhance the bone density, and further peri-implant surgery in the form of debulking of soft tissues, gingivoplasty/vestibuloplasty and free mucosal grafts to optimise the soft tissue conditions (Table  1).

40|$|Dental {{implants}} {{are usually}} used for retention of <b>fixed</b> or <b>removable</b> <b>prostheses</b> in partially or completely edentulous patients.

Implant malposition can have negative biological, functional and esthetic consequences. It can compromise the final treatment outcome and also lead to irreversible tissue destruction. Depending on its nature and severity, compensation of the malposition by prosthetic or surgical means may sometimes be possible. However, in some cases implant removal is the ultima ratio leading to significant iatrogenic tissue destruction and a complex consecutive therapy. If proper clinical, radiographic and prosthetic preoperative diagnostics are applied, the surgical and prosthetic treatment are well planned and performed thereafter, malposition can be avoided.
