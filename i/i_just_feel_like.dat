500|$|... "Feeling This" [...] was {{the first}} track that was {{recorded}} for Blink-182 in early 2003. On {{the first day of}} pre-production on the album, bassist Mark Hoppus asked an engineer to explain Pro Tools to him, as it {{was the first}} time the band would record their music digitally. He began recording guitar and bass parts and experimenting with the software. When guitarist Tom DeLonge and drummer Travis Barker arrived, they too began adding new tracks to the project. The song was written in one day. [...] "I think if I sit there and try to analyze everything, what would be cool here or there, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> I get so far away from what I would do, and I think your gut instinct is usually the best thing," [...] said Barker at the time.|$|E
500|$|When [...] "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" [...] was {{released}} {{as a single}} in late 2002, critics and the public had speculated that Beyoncé and Jay-Z were having a mutual affair. Despite widespread rumors, they remained silent about their relationship. According to critics, the title itself of the album sounded [...] "more intriguing" [...] with Beyoncé singing personal songs. Though love is the theme Beyoncé had incorporated in the album, [...] "most the material is vague enough to be about any relationship"; however, there are songs that suggested affirmation of their relationship. In the song [...] "Signs", Beyoncé sings about being {{in love with a}} Sagittarius, [...] which coincidentally is Jay-Z's zodiac sign. In response to the persistent rumors about them, Beyoncé stated, [...] "People can come to whatever conclusion they like... That's the beauty of music... I'm a singer, I'll talk about writing songs all you want. But when it comes to certain personal things any normal person wouldn't tell people they don't know, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> I don't have to [...]" ...|$|E

5000|$|DoRo {{continues}} to produce concert films and music-related documentaries, but has ceased production of music videos.

500|$|... "You Don't Know What to Do" [...] {{was written}} by Carey, Jermaine Dupri and Bryan-Michael Cox, with {{featured}} artist Wale. The song interpolates a song called [...] "I'm Caught Up in a One Night Affair", written by Patrick Adams and Terri Gonzalez and originally performed by Inner Life in 1979. Adams and Gonzalez are credited as songwriters as a result. In August 2012, Cox revealed that he, Carey and Dupri had started working on Carey's then untitled fourteenth studio album, later revealed to be Me. I Am Mariah... The Elusive Chanteuse, before the singer became pregnant with twins in 2010, and then resumed working on the project after she gave birth in 2011. [...] "She was committed to making it before she got pregnant. Then she got pregnant and she took the time off. Then after she came back, we started really vibing again and we picked up right where we left off. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> between Jermaine, myself and her, {{we came up with}} a few things that [...] really, really a solid body of work".|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} leaked onto the {{internet}} in later October 2009 with several preliminary tracks from Raymond v. Raymond. [...] "Hey Daddy (Daddy's Home)", one of the tracks that follows-up Usher's divorce, and the change in content from Here I Stand, back to Confessions-style, was one of six tracks co-written by Rico Love for the album. In an exclusive with Rap-Up, Love said of Usher's return to that style, [...] "I feel like he’s got his mind right and it’s focused. He went through a lot. He had lost his father when he was creating the Here I Stand record, {{a lot of controversy}} with his marriage, he had kids, he parted ways with his mother’s management, and there were just {{a lot of things going}} on and he kind of lost focus. It’s not like Here I Stand wasn’t a good album. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> he lost touch with his demographic." [...] According to MTV News, the song provides the reasons behind Usher's crumbling marriage as narrated in [...] "Papers". The remix version featuring Plies made its way onto {{the internet in}} late November, a few days before the song's radio and digital release.|$|E
2500|$|Many of {{his songs}} have spiritual allusions, but Stevens does not {{identify}} as a contemporary Christian music artist or frequently discuss religion with the press. He told The Village Voice, [...] "I don't think music media is the real forum for theological discussions. I think I've said things and sung about things that probably weren't appropriate {{for this kind of}} form. And <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> it's not my work or my place to be making claims and statements, because I often think it's misunderstood." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wayne Rainey {{has to win}} and Eddie Lawson has {{to finish}} outside the top 11 in order for Lawson to lose the {{championship}}. Reflecting on the mistake in Sweden that turned the championship around, Rainey says: “It’s really hard {{to tell you what}} I feel like. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> I’ve been beat up by everybody in the world, and I just feel so down and disappointed in myself. I just felt I really let myself down and my team. You know, it makes you feel like crap.” ...|$|E
2500|$|There was a brawl on pit road {{involving}} Jeff Gordon, Brad Keselowski and Kevin Harvick. Keselowski and Harvick {{were parked}} in the post-race impound area where the cars that finished second through sixth are held for post-race inspection. Gordon pulled his car and parked it right beside Brad's car. He got out and had a level-headed conversation with {{the driver of the}} No. 2 Ford that seemed to make him more angry. As Keselowski was putting on his Miller Lite cap, Kevin proceeded to shove him towards Gordon and all hell broke loose. Multiple pit crews from the three racing stables as well as Paul Menard's crew were involved (Keselowski's spot in the impound area was in the pit stall of the No. 27 car). ESPN's Jamie Little was {{caught in the middle of}} it. “We’re racing for the win,” said Keselowski of the on track contact. “ to wreck him, just racing hard. He left a hole and you know, everything you watch in racing, you leave a hole, you’re supposed to go for it. It closed back up and we made contact. I don’t want to ruin anyone’s day. I want to win the race and that was our opportunity. Just didn’t come together.” “I spun the tires a little bit but I got a pretty decent start and we went down into one and I just wanted to get to the outside of the 48 [...] and out of nowhere, I got slammed by the 2 and it cut my left rear tire. He's just a dipshit," [...] Gordon said in a nationally televised interview on ESPN. [...] "I don't know how he's ever won a championship. I'm just sick and tired of him. ... That was a huge race for us. I'm proud of Jimmie Johnson for winning that race. I didn't want that you-know-what (Keselowski) to win that race. ... (Keselowski) gets himself in this position himself and as far as I'm concerned he's got to pay the consequences. … It's total crap. The kid is just doing stuff way over his head." [...] “I'm not trying to sit here and sugarcoat it and try to be The Intimidator,’’ Keselowski said. “That's not what I'm trying to say. My expectation is if there's a gap, they'll go for it. If there's a gap, I'll go for it. If it closes up, there's contact, then that's racing. And that's what happened today. Will those guys race me hard or harder than others? Absolutely, I'm certain they will. But that's just part of it. I can't fault them for that. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> I have to go for the gap if it's there, and I have to race the way I race or I won't even be in NASCAR. I'd rather have enemies in NASCAR than have friends and be sitting at home.’’ “If you’re going to drive like that, you better be willing to fight,’’ Harvick said he told Keselowski. “He was going to stand behind his guys. Jeff Gordon deserved to at least have a face-to-face conversation with him. I wasn’t standing up for anybody. (Keselowski) just ran over (Gordon). He was standing back behind all his guys, not wanting to defend what he did. I said, ‘You’re the problem, get in your own fight.’ ‘’ Robin Pemberton, NASCAR's senior vice president of competition, said that series officials will review what took place to determine what, if any, penalties will be issued. “Holding onto each other and grabbing… that's one thing. When punches are landed, it's a different scenario," [...] Pemberton said.|$|E

5000|$|Ron Hogan for Den of Geek was {{complimentary}} of Tara's humor, saying, [...] "Alanna Masterson {{has some}} good comedic sensibilities ...

5000|$|Vocalist Craig B. {{revealed}} that the delay between My Heart Has a Wish and the band's previous release, 2004's Seclusion, was partly due to losing his singing voice for six months. Referring to the album's vocals, Craig B. stated in a 2010 interview with The Skinny that, [...] "By {{the time we got}} to My Heart Has a Wish, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> didn't <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> screaming anymore.

500|$|However, several critics {{gave the}} episode a mixed review. Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club gave the episode a B- rating and, {{although}} {{critical of the}} lack of stakes for the characters, remarked that, Jury Duty' had a certain confidence to it.

[...] Dan Forcella from TVFanatic gave the episode a 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote, [...] "there were definitely some ups and some downs in 'Jury Duty'."
