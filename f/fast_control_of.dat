50|$|The {{reduction}} in testosterone levels that occurs during GnRH antagonist therapy subsequently reduces {{the size of}} the prostate cancer. This in turn results in a {{reduction in}} prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in the patient’s blood and so measuring PSA levels is a way to monitor how patients with prostate cancer are responding to treatment. GnRH antagonists have an immediate onset of action leading to a fast and profound suppression of testosterone and are therefore especially valuable in the treatment of patients with prostate cancer, where <b>fast</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> disease is needed.|$|E

50|$|The use of {{electromagnets}} in magnetic tweezers has {{the advantage}} that the field strength and direction can be changed just by adjusting the amplitude and the phase of the current for the magnets. For this reason, the magnets {{do not need to}} be moved which allows a <b>faster</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the system and reduces mechanical noise. In order to increase the maximum field strength, a core of a soft paramagnetic material with high saturation and low remanence may be added to the solenoid. In any case, however, the typical field strengths are much lower compared to those of permanent magnets of comparable size. Additionally, using electromagnets requires high currents that produce heat that may necessitate a cooling system.|$|R
50|$|A Phase III, randomised, 12 month {{clinical}} trial (CS21) in prostate cancer compared androgen deprivation {{with one of}} two doses of degarelix or the GnRH agonist, leuprolide. Both degarelix doses were at least as effective as leuprolide at suppressing testosterone to castration levels (≤0.5 ng/mL) from Day 28 to study end (Day 364). Testosterone levels were suppressed significantly faster with degarelix than with leuprolide, with degarelix uniformly achieving castration levels by Day 3 of treatment which was not seen in the leuprolide group. There were no testosterone surges with degarelix compared with surges in 81% of those who received leuprolide. Degarelix resulted in a faster reduction in PSA levels compared with leuprolide indicating <b>faster</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the prostate cancer. Recent results also suggest that degarelix therapy may result in longer <b>control</b> <b>of</b> prostate cancer compared with leuprolide.|$|R

40|$|Can {{chromatic}} information be {{used for}} the <b>fast</b> on-line <b>control</b> <b>of</b> action? In order to find out we asked subjects to tap a red square as quickly as possible. In half of the trials the red square's position changed as soon as the subject's hand started to move. We examined how quickly subjects could adjust their movements to this change. In half of the trials there was also a green square of the same luminance as the red one. If there was a green square, and the red square's position changed, the change consisted of the two squares exchanging places, so that all that really changed was the squares' colours. In such cases subjects could not have adjusted their movements without having analysed the colour. Nevertheless, subjects could respond adequately within as little as 120 ms. This was even so if the squares' luminances changed considerably at the moment that the subject's hand started to move.

40|$|Histidine decarboxylase (HDC) {{occurs in}} ECL {{cells in the}} oxyntic mucosa of rat stomach. It is {{activated}} by gastrin. Refeeding of fasted rats or treatment with the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole promptly raised the serum gastrin concentration and consequently the HDC activity and the HDC protein content of the oxyntic mucosa. The food- and omeprazole-induced increase in HDC mRNA expression in the oxyntic mucosa was modest by comparison. Blockade of translation (cycloheximide) but not transcription (actinomycin D) prevented the postprandial rise in HDC activity. The half-life of HDC activity (after blockade of translation) was 94 min in omeprazole-treated rats and 55 min in <b>fasted</b> <b>controls.</b> The rate <b>of</b> enzyme synthesis {{was estimated to be}} 15 times higher in omeprazole-treated rats than in <b>fasted</b> <b>controls.</b> Inhibition <b>of</b> histamine uptake into ECL-cell granules by reserpine, a blocker of the vesicular monoamine transporter type- 2, lowered the HDC activity and prevented the gastrin-induced HDC activation. We suggest that HDC activation reflects enhanced transcription, translation and/or posttranslational enzyme activation as well as stabilization, and that a high cytosolic histamine concentration suppresses HDC activation.

40|$|The dorsal {{stream of}} visual {{information}} processing connecting V 1 to the parietal cortex {{is thought to}} provide a <b>fast</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> visually guided reaching. Important for this assumption was the observation that in both the monkey and the human, parietal lesions may provoke disturbance of visually goal-directed hand movements. In the human, severe misreaching termed ‘optic ataxia ’ has been ascribed to lesions of the superior parietal lobule (SPL) and/or the intraparietal sulcus. Using new tools for lesion analysis, here we re-evaluated this view investigating the typical lesion location in {{a large group of}} unilateral stroke patients with optic ataxia, collected over a time period of 15 years. We found no evidence for the assumption that disruption of visually guided reaching in humans is associated with a lesion typically centering on the SPL on the convexity. In both left and right hemispheres, we found optic ataxia associated with a lesion overlap that affected the lateral cortical convexity at the occipito-parietal junction, i. e. the junction between the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and superior occipital cortex and — in the left hemisphere even more posteriorly — also the junction between occipital cortex and the SPL. Via the underlying parietal white matter, the lesion overlap extended in both hemispheres to the medial cortical aspect, where it affected the precuneus close to the occipito-parietal junction. These lateral and medial structures seem to be integral to the <b>fast</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> visually guided reaching in humans...|$|E

The {{purpose of this}} research was to achieve a prolonged drug release and the reduction of side effects with hydrocortisone-loaded nanoparticles (NPs), for AD treatment. Poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) NPs were prepared by modified solvent displacement method and were characterized in terms of size, potential zeta, morphology, entrapment efficiency (EE), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry and in vitro permeation studies using Franz cells.
