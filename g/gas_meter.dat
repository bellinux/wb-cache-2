25|$|There are {{two primary}} methods of {{automatically}} restraining {{the flow of}} gas after an earthquake, installed on the low pressure side of the regulator, and usually downstream of the <b>gas</b> <b>meter.</b>|$|E
25|$|Thomas Thorp (1850–1914) was an English {{manufacturer}} of scientific instruments credited with inventing the first practical coin-in-the-slot <b>gas</b> <b>meter,</b> with innovations {{in the field}} of photography, including that involving colour, and for producing an early example of what has since been developed into the modern spectrohelioscope. He began his working life as an apprentice to a firm of architects and ended it as a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, having had a keen interest in astronomy since childhood.|$|E

40|$|As per the Law No. 3516 of Republic of Turkey Ministry of Industry; electric, {{water and}} <b>gas</b> <b>meters</b> are {{required}} to be periodically inspected and tested every 10 years. Being the largest gas distribution company in Turkey and having 4 millions <b>gas</b> <b>meters,</b> IGDAS (Istanbul Gas Distribution Company), under the said law, has performed calibration Works. Thus, it both fulfilled its legal obligation and sorted out some <b>gas</b> <b>meters</b> with poor measuring precision in its installations and gas losses were also minimized. This paper mainly discusses smart calibration system of natural <b>gas</b> <b>meters...</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{advent of}} {{incandescent}} gas lighting in factories, homes {{and in the}} streets, replacing oil lamps and candles with steady clear light, almost matching daylight in its colour, turned night into day for many—making night shift work possible in industries where light was all important—in spinning, weaving and making up garments etc. The social significance of this change is difficult for generations brought up with lighting after dark available {{at the touch of}} a switch to appreciate. Not only was industrial production accelerated, but streets were made safe, social intercourse facilitated and reading and writing made more widespread. Gas works were built in almost every town, main streets were brightly illuminated and gas was piped in the streets to the majority of urban households. The invention of the <b>gas</b> <b>meter</b> and the pre-payment meter in the late 1880s played an important role in selling town gas to domestic and commercial customers.|$|E
25|$|A lower {{threshold}} of mens rea is satisfied when a defendant recognizes an act is dangerous but decides to commit it anyway. This is recklessness. It is the mental {{state of mind}} of the person {{at the time the}} actus reus was committed. For instance, if C tears a <b>gas</b> <b>meter</b> from a wall to get the money inside, and knows this will let flammable gas escape into a neighbour's house, he could be liable for poisoning. Courts often consider whether the actor did recognize the danger, or alternatively ought to have recognized a risk. Of course, a requirement only that one ought to have recognized a danger (though he did not) is tantamount to erasing intent as a requirement. In this way, the importance of mens rea has been reduced in some areas of the criminal law but is obviously still an important part in the criminal system.|$|E
2500|$|Thorp also {{invented the}} rotary <b>gas</b> <b>meter</b> in 1902, and, what his {{obituary}} describes as [...] "a tiny device... for economical regulation of gas delivery [...] {{has been very}} widely employed by manufacturers and public authorities." [...] Other inventions included a push-tap for water and improvements to gas lamps and pneumatic tools.|$|E

Main pipelines of this corridor are the Krasnodar-Serpukhov pipeline and the Stavropol-Moscow pipeline, entering to Ukraine through the Prokhorivka <b>gas</b> <b>metering</b> station in {{south and the}} Serebryanka <b>gas</b> <b>metering</b> station in north. After Russia built the Sokhranovka-Oktyabrskaya bypass and the Petrovsk-Frolovo-Izobilnoye pipeline, this corridor through Ukraine is not in use.

2500|$|Buck {{was born}} in Holyoke, Massachusetts as the 3rd of 7 {{children}} by [...] Earle and Kathleen Buck. His father was a railroad accountant who commuted weekly to New Jersey. From an early age, Buck dreamed of becoming a sports announcer with his early exposure to sports broadcasting coming from listening to Boston Red Sox baseball games announced by Fred Hoey. Part of his childhood coincided with the Great Depression, and Buck remembered his family sometimes using a metal slug to keep a coin-operated <b>gas</b> <b>meter</b> going during the winter to provide heat for their home. In 1939 {{his family moved to}} Cleveland, Ohio to join their father, who had a job with the Erie Railroad. Soon after though, Buck's father {{died at the age of}} 49 due to uremic poisoning related to high blood pressure.|$|E
2500|$|Children usually {{left the}} local school for Forfar Academy {{at the age of}} 14, and with his father a teacher, Neill was {{especially}} expected to do so. Instead of wasting time and money, Neill went to work as a junior clerk in an Edinburgh <b>gas</b> <b>meter</b> factory. His parents took pity on his hatred of the job, homesickness, and its low pay, and so Neill became an apprentice draper in Forfar. He found the work stultifying and came home after a foot inflammation. Neill tried to take an examination that would raise his pay grade, but could not bring himself to study. Now 15, his parents decided to make him his father's assistant [...] "pupil teacher". The children liked Neill, though he received poor marks from a school inspector. He taught a wider range of topics as his self-confidence grew, and he developed an interest in mathematics from the Forfar Academy maths master. After four years, he tried for teacher training college, but came nearly last in his class. He continued as a pupil teacher in Bonnyrigg and Kingskettle, where he found the teachers' instruction militant and loathsome. He stayed in Kingskettle for three years, during which he learned Greek from a local priest, an experience that increased his interest in academicism and sublimated his interest in priesthood into a desire to attend university. After studying with the priest and the Forfar math master, Neill passed his university entrance exam and preliminary teacher's certification.|$|E

60|$|The effect {{produced}} {{upon the}} mind of the lady when the captain of the buccaneers entered her house was a very surprising one. Instead of beholding a savage, brutal ruffian, with ragged clothes and gleaming teeth, she saw a handsome gentleman, as well dressed as circumstances would permit, very polite in his manners, and with as great a desire to transact his business without giving her any more inconvenience than was necessary, {{as if he had been}} a tax-collector or had come to examine the <b>gas</b> <b>meter.</b> If all the buccaneers were such agreeable men as this one, she and her friends had been laboring under a great mistake.|$|E
60|$|About {{this time}} another {{difficulty}} {{began to come}} into my married life, which I suppose I ought to have foreseen--I mean the attentions of other gentlemen. I have always called forth {{a great deal of}} admiration in gentlemen, but I have always done my best to act like a lady and to discourage it in every possible way. I had been innocent enough to suppose that this would end with married life, and it gave me a dreadful shock to realize that such was not the case. The first one I noticed was a young man who came to the house, at an hour when John was out, for the purpose, so he said at least, of reading the <b>gas</b> <b>meter.</b> He looked at me in just the boldest way and asked me to show him the way to the cellar. I don't know whether it was a pretext or not, but I just summoned all the courage I had and showed him {{to the head of the}} cellar stairs. I had determined that if he tried to carry me down with him I would scream for the servants, but I suppose something in my manner made him desist, and he went alone. When he came up he professed to have read the meter and he left the house quite quietly. But I thought it wiser to say nothing to John of what had happened.|$|E
50|$|A <b>gas</b> <b>meter</b> prover is {{a device}} which verifies the {{accuracy}} of a <b>gas</b> <b>meter.</b> Provers are typically used in <b>gas</b> <b>meter</b> repair facilities, municipal <b>gas</b> <b>meter</b> shops, and public works shops. Provers work by passing a known volume of air through a meter while monitoring the gas meters register, index, or internal displacement. The prover then displays a proof, a value expressed as a percent which compares the volume of air passed with the volume of air measured to determine the meters accuracy.|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of sensor network technology to <b>gas</b> <b>metering</b> and control in a gas distribution grid is discussed. Introduced by {{a brief overview}} of sensor network and sensor fusion ideas two different scenarios for applying networked sensors to <b>gas</b> <b>metering</b> and control are discussed. Possibilities for improved <b>gas</b> <b>metering</b> accuracy and improved customer communication are discussed. Such improvements will possibly result in new customer services that can be offered by the gas supplier and better energy efficiency. Based on this it is proposed a demonstration project. Here sensor networking applied to <b>gas</b> <b>metering,</b> the resulting services and related ideas will be tested and demonstrated at 10 customers. In addition investigations on customer realtions and future system cost and quality will be made. A very rough project cost estimate is 4. 75 MSEK. To further investigate the possibilities of sensor networks in the gas distribution business also a research project is proposed. The research project will investigate new technology for estimating data on energy usage and system performance and system daignoses. Furhter architectures for suitable for networked sensors fusion in <b>gas</b> <b>metering</b> will be investigated. Project results will possibly provide more cost efficient system maintenance and improved system energy efficiency. A research project over 3. 5 year is cost estimated to 5. 82 MSEK.
