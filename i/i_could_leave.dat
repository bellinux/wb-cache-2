6000|$|... "You {{must believe}} me a perfect wretch {{if you think}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>leave</b> you in such a condition. But, Joseph, I {{would like to go}} back and dress myself properly." ...|$|E
60|$|To dine to-day with Rogers and Sharpe, {{for which}} I have some appetite, not having tasted {{food for the}} {{preceding}} forty-eight hours. I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>leave</b> off eating altogether.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Sir, {{these are}} indisputable facts, which I have {{repeated}} as accurately as <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> <b>leaving</b> your readers to draw their own conclusions.|$|R
6000|$|... "Besides {{what can}} they tell me at this moment? They {{have gone to the}} Moors and are enjoying themselves. They asked me to go with them, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not go, because you see <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>leave</b> Joan; though why <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>leave</b> her, <b>I</b> really cannot understand, because Egerton has got some moors this year, and he leaves Lady Augusta with her father." ...|$|R
60|$|MISS SUSAN. My dear, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>leave</b> this room. My lovely {{blue and}} white room. It is my husband.|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>leave</b> {{a little}} before the three months, sir, I should be glad," [...] Fawsitt said. [...] "I look at the matter from an entirely {{different}} point of view." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{told her}} that if she knew of any place {{convenient}} that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>leave</b> the child safely I would do it, rather than it should be killed by such a monster.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No,' said Miss Mohun emphatically; 'but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>leave</b> {{her there}} at five o'clock, {{and go to}} Tideshole to take old Jemmy Burnet his jersey, and call for her on the way back.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But--Your Royal Highness is very good, but I am {{sworn to}} the Prince and Queen. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>leave</b> them without permission." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I must go, monsieur. Indeed, indeed I must!" [...] {{she said}} earnestly. [...] "I am deeply {{grateful}} to you, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>leave</b> Pétronelle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because {{you were}} asleep, Foster-father, and the {{messengers}} said they must catch the tide. Also <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>leave</b> Aar until I had seen Olaf and Iduna married." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I almost wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>leave</b> {{them both}} behind, but I {{could not do}} so without hurting the {{feelings}} of the count and countess. But they are too good for an aide-de-camp's work." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Please don't say {{anything}} more," [...] she begged. [...] "I can't--quite bear it just now. You know, you must remember--there is my mother. Do {{you think that}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>leave</b> her to struggle alone?" ...|$|E
6000|$|That may be wrong, and I am to {{be taught}} better. But you wouldn't be displeased with me if things turned out so as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>leave</b> this country and go to live at Snowfield?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said he, [...] "I {{was just}} too late. He died as I got there, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>leave</b> the {{daughter}} till old Mrs. Bowers came." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Rina and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>leave</b> China, for I had now no money; but {{we went to}} {{a distant}} province, where I lived for more than ten years, passing as a Chinaman." ...|$|R
60|$|As I sat {{waiting for}} him it would {{naturally}} seem an unaccountable {{time that he was}} gone. Therefore, as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see through the woods that the sun was getting low, and it was uncertain how far the lake might be, even if we were on the right course, and in what part of the world we should find ourselves at nightfall, I proposed that I should push through with what speed <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> <b>leaving</b> boughs to mark my path, and find the lake and the Indian, if possible, before night, and send the latter back to carry my companion's bag.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>leave</b> all, {{clearness}} and mistiness; [...] Sodden or goldenly crystal, all too still. [...] Yes, and I too rot {{with the}} leaves that fill [...] The hollows in the woods; I am grown less ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Upon the whole, I {{should have}} liked our evening very well,’ gasped Gobler; ‘only I caught a desperate cold which {{increased}} my pain dreadfully! I {{was obliged to}} have several shower-baths, before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>leave</b> my room.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You poor child!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "You cannot {{think that}} since I {{know the truth}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>leave</b> you here for a single second? We can fetch your clothes any time. To-night you are coming home with me." ...|$|E
60|$|What {{was there}} to do? McAfee's Station was four miles away, and Ray's {{clearing}} two. Ray was gone with Tom. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>leave</b> Polly Ann alone. There was nothing for it but to wait.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think not}} that there is peril in so doing," [...] {{answered}} Eustace; [...] "and even if there were, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>leave</b> him in sickness, after all his kindness to me and patience with my inexperience." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is no sign}} of Mr. Weatherley at present," [...] Arnold replied, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>leave</b> {{here until}} I had seen him. I thought that perhaps you might be coming up to town for something." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She won't hear {{of seeing}} the doctor, sir. He's {{a good friend of}} hers--and he lives close by. I am {{unfortunately}} alone in the house. If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>leave</b> her, I would go at once and ask his advice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have nothing}} to keep me here, and if I find there is a steamer going on Wednesday I will take a berth in her; I can be ready to leave here to-morrow night; indeed, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>leave</b> to-night if necessary.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "With all my heart," [...] {{returned}} the Baron, [...] "so my Lord here gives you leave: would that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>leave</b> him {{and go with}} you. It would do my very spirit good but to set foot in a Northern keel once more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{shall see}} him,' said Mr. Dutton, taking the pretty boy almost reverently on his knee, 'but {{he is at}} home now. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>leave</b> him out on the street, and I {{did not know if}} I might bring him in.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This house--this place made {{me think}} of it. It was Dorothy Manners's gown, and her necklace. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>leave</b> them. They were all the remembrance I had of that night at Mr. Brinsmade's gate, when we came so near to each other." ...|$|R
60|$|Viola's {{carriage}} was now actually coming, and as I {{went into}} the house with her, she held me, whispering to me to come home at once with her, but I told her <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>leave</b> them in that way, and they were really my nephews.|$|R
6000|$|... "And so {{you kept}} {{everything}} ready?" [...] Charnock rejoined. [...] "Well, I imagine that's significant! But you see, I didn't know <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>leave</b> camp {{until the day}} before I started, and then {{it looked as if}} I'd get here as soon as the mail." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>leave</b> {{much of my}} luggage, my clothes, some of them, and {{particularly}} my violin, {{it would be much}} more to my convenience. I do not care to be mobilised with my violin. There may be much crowding. Then I would but just take my rucksack...." ...|$|E
6000|$|She started. [...] "Tito, {{how could}} we leave Florence? Surely you do not think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>leave</b> it--at least, not yet--not for a long while." [...] She had turned cold and trembling, and did not find it quite easy to speak. Tito must know the reasons she had in her mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{not quite}} <b>leave</b> off believing the dreadful things Mr. Maddox and Maria {{said they would}} do to me if I told." ...|$|R
5000|$|The celebrated Polish World War II Special Operations Executive agent Krystyna Skarbek, aka Christine Granville, used Svengali as {{a metaphor}} when saying of her second husband, Jerzy Giżycki: [...] "He was my Svengali {{for so many years}} that he would never believe that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> ever <b>leave</b> him for good." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Vincent," [...] said I, [...] "you do not {{understand}} at all why I am here--why I have been here so much--why I {{did not go to}} Europe. The truth is, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>leave.</b> <b>I</b> do not wish to be away; I want to come here and live here always--" ...|$|R
