40|$|Abstract – Steel <b>braced</b> <b>frame</b> {{is one of}} the {{structural}} systems used to resist earthquake loads in structures. Many existing reinforced concrete structures need retrofitting to overcome deficiencies and to resist seismic loads. The use of steel bracing systems for strengthening or retrofitting seismically in adequate reinforced concrete frames is a viable solution for enhancing earthquake resistance. Steel bracing is economical, easy to erect, occupies less space and has flexibility to design for meeting the required strength and stiffness. In the present study, seismic propensity of knee <b>braced</b> <b>frames</b> as weigh against concentric <b>braced</b> <b>frames</b> was investigated. These investigations were based on stiffness and ductility. Single- bay reinforced concrete frames in two levels which are a 1 - story and a 10 - story with three modes which are reinforced concrete <b>frame</b> without <b>brace</b> and reinforced concrete <b>frame</b> with concentric <b>brace</b> system and reinforced concrete <b>frame</b> with knee <b>brace</b> system were considered. Displacement analysis were performed using the Extended 3 D Analysis of Building Systems (ETABS) software for investigating stiffness of these system and pushover analysis were performed through Open System for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (OPENSEES) software for investigating ductility of these system. Finally, analysis of cyclic loading was done by using again the OPENSEES software for the completion of the investigations. The results of these outputs indicated that concentric bracing can provide a stiffer bracing system but reduces the ductility of the reinforced concrete <b>frame.</b> Knee <b>bracing</b> can be employed to provide the desired ductility level for reinforced concrete frame. It is concluded that both concentric bracing and knee bracing systems may be used to design or to retrofit for a damage-level earthquake. However, when designing or retrofitting for a collapse-level earthquake, knee bracing is a more effective system.

30|$|At present, in {{designing}} seismic resistant steel buildings, {{systems such as}} moment <b>frames,</b> concentrically <b>braced</b> <b>frames</b> and eccentrically <b>braced</b> <b>frames</b> are widely used. Moment resisting frames show a good ductility due to the bending yield of the beam but its stiffness in low. Concentrically <b>braced</b> <b>frames</b> have a high stiffness but due to the buckling of the compressional brace, it displays a low ductility. To overcome the problem of stiffness in moment resisting frames and also the problem of low ductility in concentrically <b>braced</b> <b>frames,</b> Hjelmstad and Popov (1983) proposed the eccentric brace. By considering the appropriate amount of eccentricity, the system contains sufficient stiffness and through the shear and bending yield of the intermediary beam, the ductility will be provided. This system has fitting ductility and stiffness but to supply its ductility, the intermediary beam, {{which is one of}} the main elements of the structure, must yield and that results in severe damage to the ceiling which makes the post-earthquake repairing difficult (Balendra and Sam 1991 b, 1994).|$|R

Since current theoretical methods used to predict the buckling capacity of rack uprights appear to be over-conservative and complex, this research may provide engineers an alternative method of design using detailed finite element analysis. In this study, the results from experimental testing of upright frames with K-bracing are compared to finite element predictions of displacements and maximum axial loads.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} summarizes both {{experimental and}} analytical {{studies on the}} seismic response of conventional steel concentrically <b>braced</b> <b>frame</b> systems of the type widely used in North America, and preliminary studies of an innovative hybrid <b>braced</b> <b>frame</b> system: the Strong-Back System. The research work is part of NEES small group project entitled "International Hybrid Simulation of Tomorrow's <b>Braced</b> <b>Frames.</b> " In the experimental phase, {{a total of four}} full-scale, one-bay, two-story conventional <b>braced</b> <b>frame</b> specimens with different bracing member section shapes and gusset plate-to-beam connection details were designed and tested at the NEES@Berkeley Laboratory. Three <b>braced</b> <b>frame</b> specimens were tested quasi-statically using the same predefined loading protocol to investigate the inelastic cyclic behavior of code-compliant <b>braced</b> <b>frames</b> at both the global and local level. The last <b>braced</b> <b>frame</b> specimen was nearly identical to one of those tested quasi-statically. However, it was tested using hybrid simulation techniques to examine the sensitivity of inelastic behavior on loading sequence and to relate the behavior observed to different levels of seismic hazard. Computer models of the test specimens were developed using two different computer software programs. In the software framework OpenSees fiber-based line elements were used to simulate global buckling of members and yielding and low-cycle fatigue failure at sections. The LS-DYNA analysis program was also used to model individual struts and the test specimens using shell elements with adaptive meshing and element erosion features. This program provided enhanced ability to simulate section local buckling, strain concentrations and crack development. The numerical results were compared with test results to assess and refine and the ability of the models to predict <b>braced</b> <b>frame</b> behavior. A series of OpenSees numerical cyclic component simulations were then conducted using the validated modeling approach. Two hundred and forty pin-ended struts with square hollow structural section shape were simulated under cyclic loading to examine the effect of width-to-thickness ratios and member slenderness ratios on the deformation capacity and energy dissipation characteristics of brace members. The concept of a hybrid system, consisting of a vertical elastic truss or strong-back, and a <b>braced</b> <b>frame</b> that responds inelastically, is proposed herein to mitigate the tendency of weak-story mechanisms to form in conventional steel <b>braced</b> <b>frames.</b> A simple design strategy about member sizing of the proposed Strong-Back System is provided in this study. To assess the ability of the new Strong-Back System to perform well under seismic loading, a series of inelastic analyses were performed considering three six-story hybrid <b>braced</b> <b>frames</b> having different <b>bracing</b> elements, and three six-story conventional <b>brace</b> <b>frames</b> having different <b>brace</b> configurations. Monotonic and cyclic quasi-static inelastic analyses and inelastic time history analyses were carried out. The <b>braced</b> <b>frame</b> system behavior, <b>bracing</b> member force-displacement hysteresis loops, and system residual drifts were the primary response quantities examined. These indicated that the new hybrid system was able to achieve its design goals. Experimental results show for the same loading history that the <b>braced</b> <b>frame</b> specimen using round hollow structural sections as brace members has the largest deformation capacity among the three types of bracing elements studied. Beams connected to gusset plates at the column formed plastic hinges adjacent to the gusset plate. The gusset plates tend to amplify the rotation demands at these locations and stress concentrations tended to result in early fractures of the plastic hinges that form. To remedy this problem, pinned connection details used in the last two specimens; these proved to prevent failures at these locations under both quasi-static and pseudo-dynamic tests. Failure modes observed near the column to base plate connections in all of the specimens suggest the need for further study. Both OpenSees and LS-DYNA models developed in this study predict the global <b>braced</b> <b>frame</b> behavior with acceptable accuracy. In both models, low-cycle fatigue damage models were needed to achieve an acceptable level of fidelity. Shell element models were able to predict local behavior and the mode of failures with greater but not perfect confidence. OpenSees analysis results show that the proposed hybrid <b>braced</b> <b>frames</b> would perform better than conventional <b>braced</b> <b>frames</b> and that the story deformations are more uniform. Finally, future research targets are briefly discussed {{at the end of this}} dissertation...|$|R
