5|$|Dependent stage – At this stage, {{symptoms}} {{build up}} gradually. Hangover symptoms from excessive <b>drinking</b> may {{be confused with}} withdrawal symptoms. Many addicts will maintain their <b>drinking</b> to avoid withdrawal sickness, <b>drinking</b> small amounts frequently. They will try to hide their <b>drinking</b> problem from others and will avoid gross intoxication.|$|E

5|$|After the {{assassination}} of the King at the Stockholm opera in 1792, support for the liberal arts was withdrawn. Bellman, already in poor health from alcoholism, went into decline, <b>drinking</b> increasingly heavily. His <b>drinking</b> very likely contributed to his gout, which troubled him badly in 1790. He also caught tuberculosis: the disease had already killed his mother, and by the winter of 1792, he was seriously ill.|$|E
5|$|Another common {{ritual in}} Heathenry is sumbel, also spelled symbel, a ritual <b>drinking</b> {{ceremony}} {{in which the}} gods are toasted.|$|E
5|$|As {{time went}} by, Vainio {{consumed}} {{more and more}} alcohol. In the late 1960s he frequented Tapion Tuoppi with Gunnar Mattsson and Aarre Elo. He often carried a hip flask in case {{he ran out of}} something to drink. Vainio's deteriorating family relationships are considered to be one reason for his <b>drinking.</b> Many of his friends were heavy drinkers as well but despite his <b>drinking</b> problem, he always managed to finish his lyrics on time.|$|E

5|$|By 1926, Bryant, who had {{generally}} abstained {{from alcohol}} earlier in life, {{was suffering from}} painful and incurable adiposis dolorosa (Dercum's disease) and was <b>drinking</b> heavily. Bullitt, citing his wife's <b>drinking</b> and alleging that {{she was involved in}} a lesbian relationship with Gwen Le Gallienne, a stepdaughter of writer Richard Le Gallienne, divorced Bryant in 1930 and won sole custody of Anne. Bryant remained in Paris, occasionally advising writer Claude McKay, and briefly assisting researchers from Harvard University in preserving Reed's papers.|$|E
5|$|Chapman took up pipe smoking aged 15, which {{continued}} {{for the remainder}} of his life. He began <b>drinking</b> heavily during his time at Cambridge and St Bartholomew's, favouring gin. By the time Monty Python went on tour in 1973, Chapman's <b>drinking</b> had begun to affect his performance, causing him to miss cues to go on stage. He stopped <b>drinking</b> in Christmas 1977, concerned at being able to act in Life of Brian successfully, and remained sober {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|Digging for Fire {{features}} an ensemble cast, the largest Swanberg {{had worked with}} at the time. He and Johnson cast the film by contacting friends and other actors who they knew had enjoyed their previous film together, <b>Drinking</b> Buddies. Rosemarie DeWitt and Swanberg decided to work together after her husband, Ron Livingston, starred in <b>Drinking</b> Buddies. Unlike the other actors, Orlando Bloom was cast through an agent. Swanberg cast his own son, Jude, as the three-year-old son of the lead characters.|$|E

5|$|<b>Drinking</b> {{water in}} Flagstaff is {{produced}} from conventional surface water {{treatment at the}} Lake Mary Water Treatment Plant, located on Upper Lake Mary, {{as well as from}} springs at the inner basin of the San Francisco Peaks. Groundwater from several water wells located throughout the city and surrounding area provide additional sources of <b>drinking</b> water. Water and wastewater services are provided by the City of Flagstaff.|$|E
5|$|Ethylene glycol {{poisoning}} is poisoning {{caused by}} <b>drinking</b> ethylene glycol. Early symptoms include intoxication, vomiting and abdominal pain. Later symptoms may include a decreased level of consciousness, headache, and seizures. Long term outcomes may include kidney failure and brain damage. Toxicity and death may occur even after <b>drinking</b> a small amount.|$|E
5|$|Federal law {{states that}} {{national}} parks {{will have the}} same underage laws as the state that they are located in, and the Assimilative Crimes Act is applicable to New Jersey's underage <b>drinking</b> statute. Thus, in a private location, such as a cabin in a federal enclave in New Jersey, a parent can serve alcohol to their child, and an underage person can possess and consume alcohol. Outside of these exceptions, underage <b>drinking</b> and serving alcohol to a minor are federal misdemeanors, punishable by a fine and up to 6 months in jail. There is a five-year statute of limitations for DUI, underage <b>drinking,</b> and other alcohol violations that take place in federal enclaves.|$|E
5|$|Head: The {{head has}} large {{compound}} eyes and if mouthparts are present, {{they are almost}} always a <b>drinking</b> straw-like proboscis.|$|E
5|$|Hot {{chocolate}}, {{also known}} as hot cocoa, <b>drinking</b> chocolate or just cocoa is a heated beverage consisting of shaved chocolate, melted chocolate or cocoa powder, heated milk or water, and usually a sweetener. Hot chocolate may be topped with whipped cream. Hot chocolate made with melted chocolate is sometimes called <b>drinking</b> chocolate, characterized by less sweetness and a thicker consistency.|$|E
5|$|However {{just before}} the announcement, the <b>Drinking</b> Water Inspectorate {{announced}} that it was increasing the safe level of the chemical in <b>drinking</b> water. Hemel Hempstead MP, Mike Penning accused the government of changing the rules to suit the situation in which PFOS levels in <b>drinking</b> water in the area may rise in the future. Most of the fuel burned outrather than spilling into the soil, so the impact on surrounding land and the water table was limited.|$|E
5|$|In many societies, beer is {{the most}} popular {{alcoholic}} drink. Various social traditions and activities are associated with beer <b>drinking,</b> such as playing cards, darts, or other pub games; attending beer festivals; engaging in zythology (the study of beer); visiting a series of pubs in one evening; visiting breweries; beer-oriented tourism; or rating beer. <b>Drinking</b> games, such as beer pong, are also popular. A relatively new profession is that of the beer sommelier, who informs restaurant patrons about beers and food pairings.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to another such theory alleging that her visions {{were caused by}} bovine tuberculosis {{as a result of}} <b>drinking</b> unpasteurized milk, historian Régine Pernoud wrote that if <b>drinking</b> unpasteurized milk could produce such potential benefits for the nation, then the French government should stop mandating the pasteurization of milk.|$|E
5|$|Ion {{exchangers}} and {{demineralized water}} {{are used in}} all chemical industries, <b>drinking</b> water production, and many food industries.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{from the}} {{atmosphere}} or soil can end up in groundwater and surface water. It is also potentially in <b>drinking</b> water, e.g. from plumbing and fixtures that are either made of lead or have lead solder. Since acidic water breaks down lead in plumbing more readily, chemicals {{can be added to}} municipal water to increase the pH and thus reduce the corrosivity of the public water supply. Chloramines, which were adopted as a substitute for chlorine disinfectants due to fewer health concerns, increase corrositivity. In the US, 14–20% of total lead exposure is attributed to <b>drinking</b> water. In 2004, a team of seven reporters from The Washington Post discovered high levels of lead in the <b>drinking</b> water in Washington, D.C. and won an award for investigative reporting for a series of articles about this contamination. In the Flint water crisis, a switch to a more corrosive municipal water source elevated lead levels in <b>drinking</b> water in domestic tap water.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey and {{all other}} U.S. states comport with the {{requirement}} of the National Minimum <b>Drinking</b> Age Act of 1984, which sought to set a national standard of 21 as the minimum age for purchasing and publicly possessing alcoholic beverages. To make states comply, Congress tied a state's failure to enact a <b>drinking</b> age at 21 to a punitive decrease in a state's apportionment of federal highway funding. Federal law requires colleges and universities that accept federal financial aid institute policies to sanction students who violate underage <b>drinking</b> and other alcohol laws, and to track the number of liquor laws violations. The Chronicle of Higher Education has reported that many colleges fail to comply with these laws, and federal enforcement is minimal.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey's <b>drinking</b> age {{was lowered}} to 18 in 1973 {{as part of}} a broader legal change which reduced New Jersey's age of {{majority}} from 21 to 18. Much of the impetus for lowering the <b>drinking</b> age to 18 was to grant returning Vietnam veterans the right to purchase alcohol. Possibly because of concerns about 18-year-old high school students being able to legally purchase liquor, and then illegally consume it school, the state raised the <b>drinking</b> age to 19 in 1980. Citing statistics that indicated an increase in car deaths among drivers under 21, the <b>drinking</b> age was raised back to 21 in 1983. At the same time, the penalties for underage <b>drinking</b> were increased to include a mandatory driver's license suspension. In 1985, the state made it illegal for an adult to give alcohol to a person under 21, with exception for religious services and parents serving alcohol to their own children at home or in a private area.|$|E

5|$|Sandgrouse are gregarious, feeding in {{flocks of}} up to 100 birds. As a {{consequence}} of their dry diet, they need to visit water sources regularly. <b>Drinking</b> times vary among the species. Ten species drink at dawn, four at dusk and two at indeterminate times. When <b>drinking,</b> water is sucked into the beak which is then raised to let the water flow down into the crop. By repeating this procedure rapidly, enough water to last twenty four hours can be swallowed in a few seconds. As they travel to water holes, they call to {{members of their own}} species and many hundreds or thousands synchronise their arrival at the <b>drinking</b> site despite converging from many different locations scattered over hundreds of square miles (kilometres) of territory.|$|E
5|$|Selenium is {{used with}} bismuth in brasses to replace more toxic lead. The {{regulation}} {{of lead in}} <b>drinking</b> water applications with the Safe <b>Drinking</b> Water Act of 1974 made a reduction of lead in brass necessary. The new brass is marketed under the name EnviroBrass. Like lead and sulfur, selenium improves the machinability of steel at concentrations around 0.15%. Selenium produces the same machinability improvement in copper alloys.|$|E
5|$|Stella met Bruce Nickell in 1974. Nickell {{was a heavy}} {{equipment}} operator with a <b>drinking</b> habit, which suited Stella's lifestyle, and the two were married in 1976. In {{the course of their}} ten-year marriage, Bruce Nickell entered rehab and gave up <b>drinking.</b> Reportedly, Stella resented this. Her bar visits were curtailed by Bruce's sobriety, and Stella cultivated a home aquarium as a new hobby.|$|E
5|$|The Minister of Environment, Housing and Territorial Development {{announced}} in May 2008 that US$5.2million (9.2billion Colombian pesos) {{will be spent}} {{in order to facilitate}} the construction of facilities in areas without access to <b>drinking</b> water. The national government will control the destination of the resources and guarantees transparency in the whole spending process. According to the minister, Colombia should already have reached full <b>drinking</b> water coverage, given the past investments in the sector.|$|E
5|$|The {{final step}} of <b>drinking</b> water {{treatment}} is disinfection {{to ensure that}} final <b>drinking</b> water is free from infectious microorganisms. As suspended particles (turbidity) can provide a growth substrate for microorganisms and can protect them from disinfection treatment, it is extremely important that the water treatment process achieves a good level of removal of suspended particles.|$|E

5|$|Alcoholism, {{also known}} as alcohol use {{disorder}} (AUD), is a broad term for any <b>drinking</b> of alcohol that results in mental or physical health problems. It was previously divided into two types: alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence. In a medical context, alcoholism is said to exist when {{two or more of}} the following conditions is present: a person drinks large amounts over a long time period, has difficulty cutting down, acquiring and <b>drinking</b> alcohol takes up a great deal of time, alcohol is strongly desired, usage results in not fulfilling responsibilities, usage results in social problems, usage results in health problems, usage results in risky situations, withdrawal occurs when stopping, and alcohol tolerance has occurred with use. Risky situations include <b>drinking</b> and driving or having unsafe sex among others. Alcohol use can affect all parts of the body but particularly affects the brain, heart, liver, pancreas, and immune system. This can result in mental illness, Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome, an irregular heart beat, liver failure, and an increase in the risk of cancer, among other diseases. <b>Drinking</b> during pregnancy can cause damage to the baby resulting in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Generally women are more sensitive to alcohol's harmful physical and mental effects than men.|$|E
