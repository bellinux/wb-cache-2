25|$|Novak’s wife, Geraldine, began regular churchgoing in {{the early}} 1990s and {{eventually}} settled on St Patrick’s Catholic Church, Washington, D.C. One day she persuaded Novak, who had not attended religious services for nearly 30 years, to join her at Mass. The celebrant was Fr. Peter Vaghi, whom he had known before Vaghi switched from politics to the priesthood. Novak then started to go to Mass regularly and decided to convert a few years later. According to Novak, the turning point came when he visited Syracuse University to lecture. Before he spoke, he was seated at a dinner table near a female student who wore a cross necklace. Novak {{asked her if she}} was Catholic and she asked him the same. Novak said he had been going to Mass each Sunday for the last four years, but had not converted. “Mr Novak,” the young woman replied, “life is short, but eternity is forever.” That brief sentence chilled Novak, who felt the student had channeled the Holy Spirit. When he got home and told Geraldine, they {{decided it was time to}} convert. In May 1998 Novak was received into the Roman Catholic Church at the age of 67 and became a Traditionalist Catholic. Geraldine was already a Catholic. Al Hunt, Judy Woodruff, <b>Fred</b> <b>Barnes,</b> Margaret Carlson, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Henry Hyde, and Rick Santorum attended Novak’s baptism, with some of them openly crying.|$|E

500|$|Robinson won {{the first}} two of three votes {{required}} for his election to be ratified, but allegations suddenly arose in August 2003 that Robinson had inappropriately touched a male parishioner and had connections with OutRight.org, {{which at the time}} carried a link to AllThingsBi.com, a resource site for bisexual people that included links to pornography sites. The final vote was postponed to address these last-minute charges. David W. Virtue, a critic of gay ordination, brought up the pornography allegation, claiming that: [...] "Gene Robinson's website is linked by one click to 5,000 pornographic websites." [...] When no such link was found on the Diocese of New Hampshire web page profiling the bishop-elect, Virtue stated that the link was on the website of an organization Robinson supported.

2500|$|There was {{controversy}} in 2007 about whether Sirota was a [...] "journalist" [...] or an [...] "activist". While the Washington press corps tends {{to see him}} as an [...] "activist", at one point he was criticized for skirting the rules about access to Congress, which would on some occasions deny activists access, by getting a [...] "temporary intern's ID"; this gave him access to the Senate chamber, but he was criticized in the Washington Post afterwards. He was described as having [...] "pulled an end-run around the press galleries." [...] Sirota denied he got [...] "special access" [...] and that such a claim was [...] "just bizarre." [...] He added: [...] "I think a lot of reporters on the Hill want to monopolize access to our government as a way to preserve their monopoly on news I guess."

[...] Jack Hunter, contributing editor to The American Conservative, wrote, [...] "If you ask the average film critic about the new movie adaptation of Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged they will tell you it is a horrible movie. If you ask the average conservative or libertarian they will tell you it is a great movie. Objectively, it is a mediocre movie at best. Subjectively, {{it is one of the}} best mediocre movies you'll ever see." [...] In the National Post, Peter Foster credited the movie for the daunting job of fidelity to the novel, wryly suggested a plot rewrite along the lines of comparable current events, and concluded, [...] "if it sinks without trace, its backers should at least be proud that they lost their own money." ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Fred</b> ('Freddie') W. <b>Barnes</b> {{was hired}} as chief {{engineer}} in 1905, and patented the [...] "Gradua" [...] variable-ratio belt drive transmission that year. The Gradua system simultaneously changed {{the diameter of the}} crankshaft belt-drive pulley to alter the drive ratio, while moving the rear wheel forward or back to maintain belt tension. [...] The Gradua's action was controlled by a rotating lever atop the fuel tank, and was among the first attempts to provide multiple drive ratios for a motorcycle, at a time when very simple, direct belt-drive transmission was the industry norm. Variable drive ratios proved a significant advantage in competition, leading riders of other marques to complain the Gradua gave an unfair advantage; eventually Zeniths with Gradua gears were banned from many competitions. Zenith capitalized on this ban, adding the word [...] "Barred" [...] to their advertising and logo. The Gradua system was replaced by the now-standard gearbox and chain transmission in 1924.|$|R
