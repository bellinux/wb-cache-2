The basic research questions are: how do features of CAS enhance organizational learning, and how does organizational context influence the role of CAS in organizational learning? The theoretical framework focuses on the decision to contribute and adopt knowledge in distributed environments. Specifically, we investigate the intersections between the features of CAS and inhibitors to contributing or adopting knowledge, {{in the light of}} different organizational context variables. Two cases of information environments for knowledge sharing are examined: a formal <b>electronic</b> <b>library</b> <b>system</b> and an informal community that uses a variety of communication technologies.

NELS was originally designed to provide for public, development, and secure collections and objects. The secure feature for collections and objects was deferred in the initial system for implementation at a later date. The NELS system is now 9 months old and many lessons have been learned about the use and maintenance of library systems. MountainNET has 9 months of experience in operating the system and gathering feedback from the ASV 3 user community. The user community has expressed an interest in seeing security features implemented in the current system. The time has come {{to take another look at}} the whole issue of security for the NELS system. Two requirements involving security have been put forth by MountainNET for the ASV 3 system. The first is to incorporate at the collection level a security scheme to allow restricted access to collections. This should be invisible to end users and be controlled by librarians. The second is to allow inclusion of applications which can be executed only by a controlled group of users; for example, an application which can be executed by librarians only. The requirements provide a broad framework in which to work. These requirements raise more questions than answers. To explore the impact of these requirements a top down approach will be used...|$|E

Few know that the electronic heart of University Libraries system {{is tied to the}} Systems Office found behind that door and depends on the peo-ple who work there. Even fewer under-stand the concept of what an <b>electronic</b> <b>library</b> <b>system</b> means in this day and age. One definition, based on Federal Standard 1037 C, states that a system is "a collection of personnel, equipment, and methods organized to accomplish a set of specific functions. " In the University Libraries ' system, this includes every-thing that electronically supports the Libraries ' functions to collect, organize, preserve, and provide access to informa-tion in all formats.

40|$|To {{investigate}} different {{codes that}} are to be used in compressing data in an <b>electronic</b> <b>library</b> <b>system,</b> the author developed an image data base, at the resolution of the IBM PC (640 x 200 x 2), that represents typical library materials. The CCITT standard one and two dimensional compression techniques were applied to this data base and gave a compression factor (c. f.) less than the c. f. reported in the literature at higher resolution. The standards gave a very low c. f. for images that contain a lot of text. The Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) algorithm, which is usually used to compress text, was tried on the images. LZW gave better c. f. for text only images and showed promising results for other types of images. The decompression time (d. t.) of LZW is much smaller than that of the CCITT code;Three different ways to optimize LZW for compression of screens were investigated. The optimization was carried by compressing the run-lengths of the screen pels. These methods showed a small improvement in the c. f. compared to LZW at much smaller d. t;Three different versions of modifying LZW to recognize longer strings in the input were investigated and gave an improvement in the c. f. Two out of these three versions were originally proposed by the author and gave slightly less c. f. than the third one, but at much smaller compression time (c. t.). The c. t. of the third method may restrict its use to nonreal time compression, such as the case of an electronic library system;The author proposed two methods to scan a screen or read a scanned screen, that divide the screen into horizontal blocks and scan each block column by column. These methods resulted in an increase in the c. f. that is specially obvious in the case of textual screens where the c. f. is up to 4. 48 times higher than the c. f. of the CCITT standards. The c. f. is so high that these methods offer a better and simpler alternative to pattern recognition in compressing the images...|$|E

Though millions of dollars are spent building and developing these systems, research findings indicates that millions of potential users may still be ignoring them. Consequently, different Technology Acceptance Models have been applied towards understanding the effect of various factors on end users acceptance of Information Systems (IS). Gender {{has been found to}} be an important factor and, as such, has attracted a lot of attention from the research community. Our research, however, recognized the existence of a different cohort group of users of ELS with different usage behavior not just based on gender but also based on nationality and, therefore, developed a Nationality Based UTAUT (NUTAUT) adapted from UTAUT to account for the effect of gender and nationality on acceptance, simultaneously. Nationality was introduced based on the assumption that the UTAUT independent constructs will impact on acceptance and usage differently when moderated by gender and nationality simultaneously. The result obtained from the analysis of data collected from 116 student participants provides support for NUTAUT by showing that the various UTAUT constructs exert varying degree of effects when moderated by gender and nationality combined. It not only confirms the NUTAUT robustness in predicting acceptance of both Male and Female Students (91 % and 85 % respectively) but also determines the importance of each independent construct to each group, based on their nationality and gender. Social Influence was found to be significant for both international males and females while effort expectancy is a more significant factor fo...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} delineate an overview of the scientific production of the theme Information and Communication Technologies in libraries, in order to identify: the most productive authors (Lotka's Law); the historical development of number of publications and journals that published on the subject (Bradford Law); and the main approaches that cover the topic (Zipf's Law). The methodology followed four steps: choice of Web of Science as the basis for query data; setting the parameters of search strategies and the coverage period; clearance of the results; and processing of survey data. The results showed that the first works indexed in the Web of Science dating back to 1988 and that by 2014, 458 articles were produced. The scientific production remained stable in recent years. The most productive authors were Gomez, Fourie and Aharony. There was no a high concentration in a particular group, but rather a widespread authors. It was identified that there are five journals with higher productivity, account for one third of the total scientific output: <b>Electronic</b> <b>Library,</b> Program <b>Electronic</b> <b>Library</b> and Information <b>Systems,</b> <b>Library</b> Hi Tech, Library Trends and Libri. The main keywords indexed by Web of Science were: Academic Library, Internet, Digital Library, Information Retrieval, Librarians and Mobile Services.

Para medir a atividade científica, tem-se utilizado os indicadores bibliográficos que se baseiam em análise estatística de dados quantitativos encontrados na produção técnica e científica. O objetivo deste estudo foi delinear um panorama da produção científica da temática Tecnologias de Informação e Comunicação em bibliotecas, de modo a identificar: os autores mais produtivos (Lei de Lotka); a evolução histórica do número de publicações e os periódicos que mais publicaram sobre a temática (Lei de Bradford); e as principais abordagens que cobrem o tema (Lei de Zipf). A metodologia seguiu quatro etapas: escolha da Web of Science como base de dados de consulta; configuração dos parâmetros das estratégias de busca e do período de cobertura; depuração dos resultados; e tratamento dos dados de pesquisa. Os resultados mostraram que os primeiros trabalhos indexados na Web of Science datam de 1988 e que, até 2014, foram produzidos 458 artigos. A produção científica se mostrou estável nos últimos anos.
