The Ciccone siblings resented housekeepers and invariably rebelled against anyone brought into their home ostensibly {{to take the place}} of their beloved mother. Madonna later told Vanity Fair that she saw herself in her youth as a [...] "lonely girl who was searching for something. I wasn't rebellious in a certain way. <b>I</b> <b>cared</b> about being good at something. I didn't shave my underarms and I didn't wear make-up like normal girls do.

500|$|And the Band Played On was {{critically}} acclaimed {{and became a}} best-seller. Judith Eannarino of the Library Journal called it [...] "one {{of the most important}} books of the year", upon its release. It made Shilts both a star and a pariah for his coverage of the disease and the bitter politics in the gay community. He described his motivation to undertake the writing of the book in an interview after its release, saying, [...] "Any good reporter could have done this story, but I think the reason I did it, and no one else did, is because I am gay. It was happening to people <b>I</b> <b>cared</b> about and loved." [...] The book was later adapted into an HBO film of the same name in 1993. Shilts was tested for HIV while he was writing the book; he died of complications from AIDS in 1994.|$|E

500|$|Following Sonny Bono's {{death in}} a skiing {{accident}} in 1998, Cher delivered a tearful eulogy at his funeral, calling him [...] "the most unforgettable character" [...] she had met. She paid tribute to him by hosting the CBS special Sonny & Me: Cher Remembers, which aired on May 20, 1998. That month, Sonny and Cher received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for Television. Later that year, Cher published The First Time, a collection of autobiographical essays of [...] "first-time" [...] events in her life, which critics praised for revealing the singer to be down to earth and genuine. Although the manuscript was almost finished when Sonny died, she could not decide whether to include his death in the book; she feared being criticized for capitalizing on the event. She later told Rolling Stone, [...] "I couldn't ignore it, could I? I might have if <b>I</b> <b>cared</b> more about what people think than what I know is right for me." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{the film}} {{received}} critical acclaim and several awards, Allen himself was disappointed with it, {{and said in}} an interview, [...] "When Annie Hall started out, that film {{was not supposed to}} be what I wound up with.

That was not what <b>I</b> <b>cared</b> about... In the end, I had to reduce the film to just me and Diane Keaton, and that relationship, so I was quite disappointed in that movie". Allen has repeatedly declined to make a sequel, and in a 1992 interview stated that [...] "Sequelism has become an annoying thing. [...] I don't think Francis Coppola should have done Godfather III because Godfather II was quite great. [...] When they make a sequel, it's just a thirst for more money, so I don't like that idea so much".|$|E

By December 27, 2010, Owumi had signed a lucrative deal with Al-Nasr, a team from Benghazi that played in the top Libyan league, and was arriving in the country. Despite fears of the country's instability {{in the midst of}} the budding Arab Spring and discouragement from his girlfriend Alexis Jones, he chose to remain with the team, prompted by the poor conditions in Macedonia. He later said, [...] "The most important thing was to get out of the bad situation I was in, and once I had the opportunity to get some place better to play basketball, that's all I really cared about.

500|$|Kelly West of Cinema Blend focused {{primarily}} on the series finale in her review but referred to this episode as containing a solid case-of-the-week. “Overall {{it was a good}} mystery-of-the-week but seeing as it was the second to last episode, the only thing <b>I</b> <b>cared</b> about was that we finally got more Weevil!” Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave the episode a mixed review, stating that the case-of-the-week was an oversimplification of the overall themes of Veronica Mars. The reviewer enjoyed the potential for Logan and Dick’s character development, although he felt that it was blunted by the knowledge that the series was about to end. “As fun as this episode is, the lack of the fourth season stops me from fully enjoying it. [...] But the knowledge that this might be the last time we see them puts a damper on things. Still, better to go out with good episodes than bad.” ...|$|E
500|$|The {{video for}} [...] "Ice Princess" [...] was {{directed}} by duo WeWereMonkeys. It was released on March 31, 2015, via Banks' VEVO channel. The video depicts Banks as the frozen leader of a robotic ninja army, with snakes for hair, {{in the style of}} Greek mythology's Medusa. She leads her CGI army into battle with a volcano that produces multicolored clouds, that eventually end up destroying her. Reviews of the video were positive. Kate Beaudoin of Mic called the video [...] "epic", while Daily Mails Jennifer Pearson called it [...] "spine-tingling" [...] and according to James Rettig from Stereogum, it's a [...] "slick" [...] music video. Banks initially caused controversy with promotion for the song, posting pictures of her in makeup for the video, claiming she was in whiteface, which caused outrage on the internet. However, Banks ultimately revealed that she was trolling the media, and the makeup was not finished, being applied for the music video for [...] "Ice Princess". She later tweeted [...] "Lol u crackers wish <b>I</b> <b>cared</b> enough to be doing whiteface. I'm becoming the ICE PRINCESS YAAAAAAS".|$|E
500|$|One notable {{advocate}} for the fledgling movement was Mark Twain. Manipulative treatments had purportedly alleviated the symptoms of his daughter Jean's epilepsy as well as Twain's own chronic bronchitis. In 1909, he spoke before the New York State Assembly at a hearing regarding the practice of osteopathy in the state. [...] "I don't know as <b>I</b> <b>cared</b> much about these osteopaths until I heard {{you were going to}} drive them out of the state, but since I heard that I haven't been able to sleep." [...] Philosophically opposed to the American Medical Association's stance that its own type of medical practice was the only legitimate one, he spoke in favor of licensing for osteopaths. Physicians from the New York County Medical Society responded with a vigorous attack on Twain, who retorted with [...] "he physicians think they are moved by regard for {{the best interests of the}} public. Isn't there a little touch of self-interest back of it all?" [...] "...The objection is, people are curing people without a license and you are afraid it will bust up business." ...|$|E

[...] Terrified that her father, Tony Ciccone, could be taken from her as well, Madonna was often unable to sleep unless she was near him. Two years after her mother's death, her father married the family's housekeeper, Joan Gustafson.
