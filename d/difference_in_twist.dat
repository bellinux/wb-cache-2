40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the immunoexpression of TWIST and p-Akt proteins in oral leukoplakia (OL) and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), correlating their expressions with the histological features of the lesions. Study design: Immunohistochemical studies were carried out on 10 normal oral epithelium, 30 OL and 20 OSCC formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples. Immunoperoxidase reactions for TWIST and p-Akt proteins were applied on the specimens and the positivity of the reactions was calculated for 1000 epithelial cells. Results: Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's post tests revealed a significant <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>TWIST</b> and p-Akt immunoexpression among normal oral mucosa, OL and OSCC. In addition, a significant positive correlation was found between TWIST and p-Akt expressions according to the Pearson's correlation test. Conclusions: The results obtained in the current study suggest that TWIST and p-Akt may participate of the multi-step process of oral carcinogenesis since its early stages. © Medicina Oral S.

40|$|Aims and methods: Epithelial-mesenchymal {{transition}} (EMT) {{has previously}} been linked to glioma invasion and progression. To determine whether EMT regulators, Twist and Zeb 1, had clinical significance in astrocytic gliomas, the association of Twist and Zeb 1 with clinicopathological and molecular factors was studied in 269 astrocytoma samples. Results: Twist and Zeb 1 were widely expressed in astrocytic gliomas, but {{the expression of the}} former did not correlate with that of the latter. Stronger Twist expression levels were associated with higher WHO grades (p= 0. 001), whereas Zeb 1 did not correlate with WHO grades. We found no association between Twist and proliferation activity (Ki 67 /MIB- 1), p 53 status, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) amplification or neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) expression. There was no significant <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>Twist</b> or Zeb 1 expression when primary and secondary gliomas were analysed. Tumours with high Twist expression were IDH 1 negative (p= 0. 009). High hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 α expression correlated significantly with positive Twist expression (p< 0. 001), whereas it was not associated with Zeb 1 expression. Zeb 1 expression did not correlate with proliferation, EGFR or IDH 1. Nevertheless, we did find a correlation between high Zeb 1 expression and low p 53 expression levels (p= 0. 027). Positive NCAM expression was significantly associated with Zeb 1 positivity (p= 0. 022). Zeb 1 had no association with patient survival, whereas positive Twist expression predicted poor survival for patients in both univariate (p< 0. 001) and multivariable analyses (p= 0. 027). Conclusions: EMT regulators, Twist and Zeb 1, are common features of infiltrating astrocytomas, and Twist is upregulated in glioblastomas in particular. Twist may be a novel marker for poor prognosis in glioma patients. 8 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Many RNA {{interactions}} in cells {{occur in the}} form of loop-loop interactions, also known as a 2 ̆ 2 kissing complex 2 ̆ 2. In the bacterial and viral systems discussed here, there are transiently bound proteins involved that modulate the function of kissing complex. These proteins either stabilize the kissing complex or facilitate its conversion to extended duplex. I studied R 1 inv-R 2 inv kissing complex (KC), derivatived from RNAI-RNAII complex of E. Coli. Rop protein is known to stabilize the bent R 1 inv-R 2 inv KC against dissociation. The goal was to study structural change of this kissing complex after binding of the stabilizing Rop protein. In this work for the first time I used the orientation sensitivity of Fluorescence Resonance energy transfer (FRET) to measure an angular change in the structure of R 1 inv-R 2 inv kissing complex upon binding of Rop protein. Single-molecular-pair-FRET (spFRET) is often used to study distance fluctuations of single molecules, it is harder to capture angular changes using FRET, because rotational motion of the dyes tends to wash out the angular sensitivity. The effect of Rop protein on the conformation of the kissing complex is not known. Using fluorescence microscopy techniques we observe a change in twist angle of the KC with protein binding. The eight minimized energy structures reported for R 1 inv-R 2 inv KC show a small difference in end-to-end distance and a larger <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>twist</b> and bend angles. From MD simulations I modeled FRET for these eight structures, also for these structures with addition of twist. By comparing the spFRET data with results of this first-principle model, I found the result is consistent with a - 25 o change in twist angle. My preliminary work on another kissing complex, Dimerization initiation site (DIS) of HIV- 1 retrovirus, is also discussed. Nucleocapsid protein (NCp 7) {{plays an important role in}} facilitating the kissing complex to extended duplex transition for DIS. My work on DIS kissing complex, was aimed at studying possible intermediates in kissing complex to duplex transition, and investigating the effect of proteins like Rop and NCp 7. The construction of the TIRF-FRET instrument, methods for surface passivation, and the RNA sequence design are discussed...|$|E

This problem is solved by using a set of solid cylindrical bars with different diameters such that the <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> diameter of two successive bars is small.

40|$|AbstractThe {{lack of a}} {{rigorous}} analytical theory for DNA looping has caused many DNA-loop-mediated phenomena to be interpreted using theories describing the related process of DNA cyclization. However, distinctions in the mechanics of DNA looping versus cyclization can have profound quantitative effects on the thermodynamics of loop closure. We have extended a statistical mechanical theory recently developed for DNA cyclization to model DNA looping, taking into account protein flexibility. Notwithstanding the underlying theoretical similarity, {{we find that the}} topological constraint of loop closure leads to the coexistence of multiple classes of loops mediated by the same protein structure. These loop topologies are characterized by dramatic <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>twist</b> and writhe; because of the strong coupling of twist and writhe within a loop, DNA looping can exhibit a complex overall helical dependence in terms of amplitude, phase, and deviations from uniform helical periodicity. Moreover, the DNA-length dependence of optimal looping efficiency depends on protein elasticity, protein geometry, and the presence of intrinsic DNA bends. We derive {{a rigorous}} theory of loop formation that connects global mechanical and geometric properties of both DNA and protein and demonstrates the importance of protein flexibility in loop-mediated protein-DNA interactions...|$|R

40|$|Repetitive lifting/lowering is {{associated}} with an increased risk of work-related low back disorders (WRLBDs), and fatigue may exacerbate such risk. Work methods used by experienced workers are potential models for developing worker training to reduce WRLBDs, though whether experience modifies the effects of fatigue on WRLBD risk is largely unknown. Here, six novices and six experienced workers completed 185 cycles of repetitive, asymmetric lifts/lowers. Physical demands, whole-body balance and torso movement stability were assessed using torso kinematics/kinetics, linear/angular momenta and Lyapunov exponents, respectively. Several fatigue-induced changes in movement strategies were evident. Novices decreased and experienced workers increased peak lumbar moments post-fatigue, suggesting lower WRLBD risks among the former in terms of torso kinetics. Other than lumbar moments, though, fatigue substantially reduced group-level <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> torso <b>twisting</b> velocities and accelerations. Post-fatigue movement strategies of experienced workers thus {{did not appear to be}} advantageous in terms of WRLBD risk. Practitioner Summary: Fatigue induced changes in movement strategies during a repetitive, asymmetric lifting/lowering task. Novices and experienced workers adapted to fatigue differently, with diminished post-fatigue <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> lifting strategies. Regarding work-related low back disorder risks, the post-fatigue movement strategies of experienced workers did not appear superior to those of novices. close 0...|$|R
40|$|A {{methodology}} and apparatus {{have been proposed}} to indirectly evaluate twist liveliness of spun yarns by measuring the number of snarl turns formed of a yarn submerged in a water bath. A comparative study was carried out {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of water in the measurement of yarn snarls. T tests showed that water has a significant effect in the snarl forming and testing results. Systematic studies were then carried out in the intra and inter laboratories to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed measurement system. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) for the studies showed that there is no significant <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> measuring <b>twist</b> liveliness between the operators in the same laboratory and between the operators from different laboratories, respectively. The largest variance in the tests is attributed to the expected variation in the level of snarl turns in different yarn specimens.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} a novel {{method for}} rapid quantification of left ventricular (LV) twist was developed, validated, and clinically evaluated. LV twist {{is defined as}} the <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> rotation of the apex relative {{to the base of the}} heart. Alteration <b>in</b> LV <b>twist</b> has been shown the correlate with LV dysfunction. Rotation was measured using Fourier Analysis of STimulated echoes (FAST), an image acquisition and rapid processing method. FAST can be applied to cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) images with myocardial tagging, which imparts a sinusoidal pattern on the myocardial tissue that deforms with the LV during contraction and relaxation. First, FAST estimates of LV twist were validated using intra- and inter-observer comparison, intra- and inter-scan comparison, and comparison to values derived from a `gold-standard' technique. Second, FAST was used in conjunction with a CMR imaging technique designed to lengthen the duration of myocardial tag detection to acquire diastolic twist information. Third, FAST was applied to an imaging technique developed to minimize chemical shift induced myocardial tagging pattern artifacts, which produces more accurate measurements of LV twist. Fourth, FAST was used in combination with two free-breathing techniques to determine the impact of free-breathing on FAST estimates of LV twist. Fifth, FAST was used to characterize <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> LV <b>twist</b> <b>in</b> patients with moderate and severe mitral regurgitation. LV twist measurements derived from FAST showed good agreement for the intra- and inter-observer study and the intra- and inter-scan study. Additionally, systolic LV twist values matched well with the `gold-standard'. When used in combination with the improved myocardial tag duration, FAST estimates of diastolic LV twist matched well with literature values. LV twist derived from the normal imaging technique compared with the artifact minimizing technique did not detect any significant differences, however this study was performed in healthy subjects, specific patient populations may provide different results. The free-breathing study detected a significant decrease peak LV twist due to free-breathing compared with breath-held imaging derived values. A significant decrease <b>in</b> peak LV <b>twist</b> was detected <b>in</b> patients with moderate and severe mitral regurgitation. Overall, the FAST method for quantitative LV twist measurement has been validated and shown to produce accurate measurements of twist with limited user interaction...|$|R

The 5. 3 -nm pitch conformation appears to be a mixture of two discrete structural states, with a small <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> the <b>twist</b> of the structure between the two. We have used image reconstruction techniques on an averaged data set from eight negatively stained nucleocapsids to produce a three-dimensional reconstruction at 2. 4 -nm resolution of the structure in one of the 5. 3 -nm pitch states. There are 13. 07 nucleocapsid protein (NP) subunits in each turn of the helix in this state. The helical repeat is 79. 5 nm, containing 196 subunits in 15 turns of the left-handed 5. 3 -nm helix. The arrangement of subunits produces a 5. 0 -nm-diameter hollow core which forms an internal helical groove. The RNA accounts for about 3 % of the mass of the nucleocapsid, and so its location is not conspicuous in the reconstruction. Because of the RNA remains associated with the NP subunits during mRNA transcription and genome replication, structural transitions in the nucleocapsid may determine the accessibility of the genome to polymerases. Alternatively, the large hollow core and internal helical groove we have reconstructed may allow access to the RNA even in the tightly coiled 5. 3 -nm pitch conformation...|$|R

40|$|The crystal {{structure}} of the synthetic DNA dodecamer CGCATATATGCG has been solved at 2. 2 -A resolution. Its central 6 base pairs adopt the alternating-B-DNA helix structure proposed nearly a decade ago. This alternating poly(AT) structure contrasts with the four known examples {{of what can be}} termed a poly(A) subfamily of B-DNA structures: CGCAAAAAAGCG, CGCAAATTTGCG, CGCGAATTCGCG, and CGCGAATTbrCGCG, their defining characteristic being a succession of two or more adenines along one strand, in a region of 4 or more A. T base pairs. All five helices show a characteristically narrow minor groove in their AT centers, but the mean propeller twist at A. T base pairs is lower in the alternating poly(AT) helix than in the poly(A) subfamily of helices. Three general principles emerge from x-ray analyses of B-DNA oligonucleotides: (i) GC and mixed-sequence B-DNA have a wide minor groove, whereas the minor groove is narrow in heteropolymer or homopolymer AT sequences. (ii) G. C base pairs have low propeller twist; A. T pairs can adopt a high propeller twist but need not do so. A high propeller twist can be stabilized by cross-strand hydrogen bonds in the major or minor groove, examples being the minor groove bonds seen in CCAAGATTGG and the major groove bonds that can accompany AA sequences in the poly(A) family. (iii) Homopolymer poly(A) tracts may be stiffer than are alternating AT or general-sequence DNA because of these cross-strand major groove hydrogen bonds. Poly(A) tracts appear internally unbent, but bends may occur at junctions with mixed-sequence DNA because of <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> propeller <b>twist,</b> base pair inclination, and base stacking on {{the two sides of the}} junction.
