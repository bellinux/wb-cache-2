40|$|The Supplier-Relationship Management {{system is}} used by SC Department of Motor Vehicles {{personnel}} to requisition most purchases of services and materials for DMV purposes. General ledger account codes are first assigned by the shopping cart preparer. Administrative departments such as procurement, payables and budget regularly correct general ledger codes during the purchasing cycle to ensure proper reporting. DMV goals are consistent with accurate reporting of expenditures by general ledger account code. Incorrect reporting would be contrary to DMV' s vision of promoting effective and efficient business processes. Journal entries increased from 34 to 66 in FY 2014 and FY 20152; with a notable amount correcting the <b>general</b> <b>ledger</b> <b>code.</b> This project examines the assignment or correction of general ledger account codes for DMV's planned purchases {{for the purpose of}} process improvement...|$|E

5000|$|A <b>general</b> <b>ledger</b> {{contains}} all the accounts for recording transactions relating to a company's assets, liabilities, owners' equity, revenue, and expenses. In modern accounting software or ERP, the <b>general</b> <b>ledger</b> {{works as a}} central repository for accounting data transferred from all subledgers or modules like accounts payable, accounts receivable, cash management, fixed assets, purchasing and projects. The <b>general</b> <b>ledger</b> is the backbone of any accounting system which holds financial and non-financial data for an organization.

50|$|In the General Journal, {{transactions}} are recorded in several lines (see Figure 1), and each transaction is posted to the <b>general</b> <b>ledger</b> separately. For example, if fifty sales on account were made during one day, fifty ledger postings {{would have to be}} made to three <b>general</b> <b>ledger</b> accounts: Accounts Receivable, Sales, and Sale Tax Payable. In special journal, {{transactions are}} recorded in a single line, and the format of the journal made it possible to post only the total amount for each account to the <b>general</b> <b>ledger.</b> For example, if fifty sales on account were made during one day, only the total amount for Accounts Receivable, Sales, and Sales Tax Payable were posted to the <b>general</b> <b>ledger.</b> Thus the posting process is more efficient.

50|$|The <b>general</b> <b>ledger</b> {{should include}} the date, {{description}} and balance or total amount for each account. It is usually divided into at least seven main categories.

The total of the subledger would match the line item amount on the <b>general</b> <b>ledger.</b> This corresponding line item in the <b>general</b> <b>ledger</b> {{is referred to as the}} controlling account.

40|$|In January 1979, the University of California Division of Library Automation (DLA) {{found itself}} {{with the problem of}} {{maintaining}} a timely, ledger. Also at that time, DLA was building a large-scale IBM operating system to support the University of California Online Union Catalog. This system also had all of the computing resources to support a sophisticated <b>general</b> <b>ledger</b> system. So, an obvious issue emerged as to whether it was more cost-effective to buy, or to write from scratch, a <b>general</b> <b>ledger</b> program. Common sense suggested that it ought to be simple to buy such software. However, exhaustive investigation revealed that flexible <b>general</b> <b>ledger</b> systems came as part of a turnkey hardware/software solution. The fact was that the IBM/ 370 operating system proprietary software was either mostly batch, or otherwise required costly teleprocessing software which was not a part of DLA's intended software inventory. Timesharing was considered too, but even if the right software could have been identified and located, its cost would have been greater than writing the same programs in-house. The unexpected conclusion was that it was cost-justifiable to devote a programmer's time to develop an online <b>general</b> <b>ledger</b> system that would be tailor made to DLA's needs. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|R
5000|$|Each {{financial}} transaction is recorded {{in at least}} two different nominal ledger accounts within the financial accounting system, so that the total debits equals the total credits in the <b>General</b> <b>Ledger,</b> i.e. the accounts balance. This is a partial check that each and every transaction has been correctly recorded. The transaction is recorded as a [...] "debit entry" [...] (Dr) in one account, and a [...] "credit entry" [...] (Cr) in a second account. The debit entry will be recorded on the debit side (left-hand side) of a <b>General</b> <b>ledger</b> account, and the credit entry will be recorded on the credit side (right-hand side) of a <b>General</b> <b>ledger</b> account. If the total of the entries on the debit side of one account is greater than the total on the credit side of the same nominal account, that account is said to have a debit balance.|$|R
