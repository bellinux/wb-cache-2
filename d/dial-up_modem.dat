25|$|Japan saw {{the release}} of the Satellaview, a modem which {{attaches}} to the Super Famicom's expansion port and connected to the St.GIGA satellite radio station from April 23, 1995 to June 30, 2000. Satellaview users could download gaming news and specially designed games, which were frequently either remakes of or sequels to older Famicom titles, and released in installments. In the United States, the relatively short-lived XBAND allowed users to connect to a network via a <b>dial-up</b> <b>modem</b> to compete against other players around the country.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} AirPort Base Station (known as Graphite, model M5757, {{part number}} M7601LL/B) features a <b>dial-up</b> <b>modem</b> and an Ethernet port. It employs a Lucent WaveLAN Silver PC Card as the Radio, and uses an embedded AMD Elan processor. It was released July 21, 1999. The Graphite AirPort Base Station is functionally {{identical to the}} Lucent RG-1000 wireless base station and can run the same firmware. Due to the original firmware-locked limitations of the Silver card, the unit can only accept 40-bit WEP encryption. Later aftermarket tweaks can enable 128-bit WEP on the Silver card. Aftermarket Linux firmware has been developed for these units to extend their useful service life.|$|E
25|$|As Microsoft {{developed}} the original Xbox console, online gaming was designated {{as one of}} the key pillars for the greater Xbox strategy. Sega had made an attempt to capitalize on the ever-growing online gaming scene when it launched the Dreamcast video game console in 1999, including online support as standard, called SegaNet and Dreamarena. Nevertheless, due to lack of widespread broadband adoption at the time, the Dreamcast shipped with only a <b>dial-up</b> <b>modem</b> while a later-released broadband adapter was neither widely supported nor widely available. Downloadable content was available, though limited in size due to the narrowband connection and the size limitations of a memory card. The online features, while praised as innovative, were largely considered a failure, and the Dreamcast's immediate competitor, the PlayStation 2, did not initially ship with built-in networking capabilities.|$|E

500|$|Physically, the Dreamcast {{measures}} [...] {{and weighs}} [...] [...] The Dreamcast's main CPU is a two-way 360MIPS superscalar Hitachi SH-4 32-bit RISC clocked at 200MHz with an 8 Kbyte instruction cache and 16 Kbyte data cache and a 128-bit graphics-oriented floating-point unit delivering 1.4GFLOPS. Its 100MHz NEC PowerVR2 rendering engine, {{integrated with the}} system's ASIC, is capable of drawing more than 3 million polygons per second and of deferred shading. Sega estimated that the Dreamcast was theoretically capable of rendering 7 million raw polygons per second, or 6 million with textures and lighting, but noted that [...] "game logic and physics reduce peak graphic performance." [...] Graphics hardware effects include trilinear filtering, gouraud shading, z-buffering, spatial anti-aliasing, per-pixel translucency sorting and bump mapping. The system can output approximately 16.77 million colors simultaneously and displays interlaced or progressive scan video at 640×480 video resolution. Its 67MHz Yamaha AICA sound processor, with a 32-bit ARM7 RISC CPU core, can generate 64 voices with PCM or ADPCM, providing ten times {{the performance of the}} Saturn's sound system. [...] The Dreamcast has 16 MB main RAM, along with an additional 8 MB of RAM for graphic textures and 2 MB of RAM for sound. [...] The system reads media using a 12x speed Yamaha GD-ROM Drive. In addition to Windows CE, the Dreamcast supports several Sega and middleware application programming interfaces. In most regions, the Dreamcast included a removable modem for online connectivity, which was modular for future upgrades. The original Japanese model and all PAL models had a transfer rate of 33.6kbit/s, while consoles sold in the US and in Japan after September 9, 1999 featured a 56 kbit/s <b>dial-up</b> <b>modem.</b>|$|E

50|$|Although {{the best}} <b>dial-up</b> <b>modems</b> are called 56 kbit/s modems, {{downstream}} speeds can {{be limited to}} a few tens of kilobits per second with even lower upstream speeds.

Mobile broadband and satellite Internet access providers also often have lower upstream speeds than downstream.|$|R
