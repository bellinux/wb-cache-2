"Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)", {{the lead}} single and first {{track of the}} album, was mainly written by Lohan as a letter to her father, Michael Lohan, who was incarcerated in June 2005 after {{surviving}} a car crash {{for which he was}} charged with driving under the influence of alcohol.

[...] As a result, training programs were shortened. Some NCOs were referred to as [...] "Shake 'N' Bake" [...] to highlight their accelerated training. Unlike soldiers in World War II and Korea, there were no secure rear areas in which to get rest and relaxation. One unidentified soldier said to United Press International {{that there was nothing}} to do in Vietnam and therefore many of the men smoked marijuana. He said, [...] "One of the biggest reasons that a lot of GIs do <b>get</b> high <b>over</b> <b>here</b> is there is nothing to do.

5000|$|Duane {{learned to}} play slide guitar on his {{birthday}} in 1968. He was recovering from an injury to his left elbow, caused in a fall from a horse. Gregg brought him a birthday present, the debut album by Taj Mahal, {{and a bottle of}} Coricidin pills. He left them on the front porch and rang the bell, as Duane was angry with him about the injury. [...] "About two hours after I left, my phone rang," [...] Gregg recalled. [...] "'Baby brother, baby brother, <b>get</b> <b>over</b> <b>here</b> now!'" [...] Duane had poured the pills out of the bottle and washed off the label and was using it as a slide to play along with the album track [...] "Statesboro Blues" [...] (on the recording, the slide guitar is played by Jesse Ed Davis). [...] "Duane had never played slide before," [...] said Gregg, [...] "he just picked it up and started burnin'. He was a natural." [...] (-quoted from:Muscle Shoals (film)). The song became a part of the Allman Brothers Band's repertoire, and Duane's slide guitar became crucial to their sound. Because of his use of the early-1970s-era Coricidin medicine bottle, which is no longer manufactured, replica Coricidin bottles are now popular with slide guitar players who like its glassy feel and sound.|$|E

Due to limited power supply {{it is very difficult}} to run it for a long period of time. To run it for a long interval we need an optimum energy and load balancing option such that using this we can minimize the wastage of power consumption. Basically the main power is wasted by transceiver to find an appropriate route for data transmission, So that the sense data can reach to a sink for further processing. In this regards the routing is very vital issue. Normally, using single sink network sense data is routed to the sink using shortest path routing approach, due to this the node near to the sink are quickly exhausted as a result network <b>get</b> down. <b>Over</b> <b>here</b> we are implement a new routing algorithm using multi sink platform with few most important constraints like energy, load and hop count to select an appropriate route or path to enhance the lifetime of Wireless sensor networks.
