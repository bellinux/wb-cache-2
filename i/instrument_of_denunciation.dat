40|$|In totalitarian systems, {{poetry and}} theatre act as safety valves and as <b>instruments</b> <b>of</b> <b>denunciation.</b> Both genres, in {{original}} or translated form, {{are in the}} censorship spotlight and rarely manage to escape the filtering process. This paper examines by what means the Romanian poet and translator Dumitru Trancă managed to dodge the censorship filter and to publish some of the poems of the Catalan writer Salvador Espriu. The translator’s subversive intention shows clearly through distinct mechanisms: 1. focus on Espriu’s social poetry, especially on La pell de brau (The Bull-hide); 2. choice of themes that fostered comparisons between the oppressed Romania under the communism, by one hand, and the oppressed Catalonia and Spain under the Francoism by the other and 3. insertion of Romanian folkloric rhythms and symbols to cast light on the similar oppressive mechanisms...|$|R

5000|$|There was {{the danger}} <b>of</b> <b>denunciation.</b> The Constitutio Carolina did not plan for denunciation.

In the case of innocence of the defendant the accuser would be punished. The other way to begin the proceedings was by the personal knowledge of the authorities. This degenerated into a system <b>of</b> <b>denunciation.</b> In some regions during witch trials a box <b>of</b> <b>denunciation</b> (a box hanging or standing at a public place), was used to enable everyone to make anonymous accusations by inserting {{a piece of paper}} without revealing their names, and thus assuming no risk.|$|R

Bernardo (1934), Vidas Secas (1938) e MemÃrias do CÃrcere (1953), de Graciliano Ramos, bem como nas traduÃÃes destes romances ao cinema por Leon Hirszman â SÃo Bernardo, em 1972 â e Nelson Pereira dos Santos â Vidas Secas, em 1963 e MemÃrias do CÃrcere, em 1984. No contexto do Realismo CrÃtico, por meio de anÃlises de aspectos inerentes Ã composiÃÃo da estrutura literÃria â narrador, enredo, personagens, tempo e espaÃo â e dos artifÃcios da produÃÃo da imagem fÃlmica â relacionados aos trabalhos das equipes de direÃÃo, arte e fotografia, durante a etapa de filmagem â, pretende-se compreender como imagens do real sÃo materializadas em narrativas literÃria e fÃlmica nas referidas obras. Para tanto, dentre outros, estudos de AndrÃ Bazin, Antonio Candido, Frances Yates, Georg LukÃcs, Glauber Rocha, Mikhail Bakhtin e Terry Eagleton ancoram a articulaÃÃo da anÃlise da relaÃÃo Texto e Contexto â forma e conteÃdo â, na composiÃÃo da materialidade de tais obras. Nestas anÃlises, reflete-se, tambÃm, sobre a relaÃÃo intrÃnseca da trÃade autor-texto-leitor â poiesis, aisthesis e catarsis â, tendo em vista que, no momento de encontro destas narrativas com o leitor/espectador, o conteÃdo tem supremacia sobre a forma. Considerando o fato de que a arte contemporÃnea, ao se apropriar de tempos histÃricos, evoca o passado e ilumina as vivÃncias do presente, como tambÃm o pressuposto de que, em arte, nÃo existe uma realidade pura, uma vez que, em ficÃÃo, tudo Ã imitaÃÃo â {{conforme}} postulados de AristÃteles sobre mimesis â, parte-se do pressuposto de que o escritor alagoano, Graciliano Ramos, na composiÃÃo de seus romances, se apropria de fatos sociais do meio em que vive e os transforma em conteÃdos que estruturam o seu fazer literÃrio, os quais sÃo traduzidos em outra linguagem pelos cineastas Leon Hirszman e Nelson Pereira dos Santos. Por fim, argumenta-se que estes romances e filmes â sendo, antes de tudo, obras ficcionais â, tÃm a materializaÃÃo do seu conteÃdo â Realismo CrÃtico â transpassado, necessariamente, pela artificialidade da composiÃÃo artÃstica, ainda que tenham sido concebidos por seus criadores como um instrumento de denÃncia, de conscientizaÃÃo e de transformaÃÃo da realidade vivenciada pelo povo brasileiroThis {{study which}} is analytical and bibliographic {{aimed to explore}} the reality materialization on the novels S. Bernardo (1934), Vidas Secas (1938) and MemÃrias do CÃrcere (1953), by Graciliano Ramos, {{as well as the}} filmic translations of these to the cinema by Leon Hirszman â SÃo Bernardo in 1972 â and Nelson Pereira dos Santos â Vidas Secas in 1963 and MemÃrias do CÃrcere in 1984. It has been intended to comprehend how images of reality were turned into literary and filmic narratives on these works considering the Critic Realism context, and it was done by analyzing compositional aspects of literary structure: narrator, plot, characters, time and space, and the filmic image production aspects which were part of the work of the directing, art and photography staff at the filming stage. Therefore, studies of AndrÃ Bazin, Antonio Candido, Frances Yates, Georg LukÃcs, Glauber Rocha, Mikhail Bakhtin and Terry Eagleton articulated the analysis of the relationship between Text and Context â form and content â for the materiality composition in such works. These analyses also provided a reflection about the intrinsic relation of the tripod author-text-reader â poesies, aesthesis and catharsis â considering that at the moment the reader/spectator meet these narratives the content is supreme over the form. Having in mind that contemporary art when it appropriates historical times evocates the past and illuminates the present, and also that in art {{there is no such thing}} as a pure reality, once in fiction everything is imitation, accordingly to Aristotle&# 8223;s reflections about mimesis, it is conceived that Graciliano Ramos when writing his novels appropriated social facts from his own experiences and social context and turned them into literary contents that were the structure for his literary writing which were translated to the filmic language by the movie makers Leon Hirszman and Nelson Pereira dos Santos. Last but not least, it is considered that these novels and movies are firstly fiction works and the materialization of content â Critic Realism â passes necessarily by the artificiality of artistic composition, nevertheless, they are conceived by their creators as <b>instruments</b> <b>of</b> <b>denunciation,</b> consciousness and transformation of the Brazilian realit...|$|R
