5|$|A less {{invasive}} {{approach is}} thoracoscopy, {{usually in the}} form of a procedure called video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). The results from VATS-based pleural abrasion are slightly worse than those achieved using thoracotomy in the short term, but produce smaller scars in the skin. Compared to open thoracotomy, VATS offers a shorter in-hospital stays, less need for postoperative pain control, and a reduced risk of lung problems after surgery. VATS may also be used to achieve chemical pleurodesis; this involves <b>insufflation</b> of talc, which activates an inflammatory reaction that causes the lung to adhere to the chest wall.|$|E
5|$|Reformed Christians {{believe that}} {{immersion}} {{is not necessary}} for baptism to be properly performed, but that pouring or sprinkling are acceptable. Sprinkling is said to symbolize the sprinkling of the blood of Christ {{for the removal of}} the guilt of sin. Only ordained ministers are permitted to administer baptism in Reformed churches, contrary to the allowance for emergency baptism by midwives in Roman Catholic churches, though baptisms performed by non-ministers are generally considered valid. Reformed churches, while rejecting the baptismal ceremonies of the Roman Catholic church (such as the use of chrism, salt, and <b>insufflation),</b> accept the validity of baptisms performed with them on the basis that the substance of baptism remains. They do not rebaptize someone who has been baptized using these ceremonies because baptism is never to be repeated.|$|E
40|$|Coitus and cunnilingus during {{pregnancy}} are generally safe; whereas orogenital sex involving vaginal air <b>insufflations</b> {{can be very}} dangerous, causing even {{the death of the}} women.

25|$|With <b>insufflation</b> {{the effects}} are more abrupt and intense but have a {{significantly}} shorter duration, while oral usage results in a milder, longer experience. When insufflated, the onset happens very rapidly, usually reaching the peak at about 20–40 minutes and plateauing for 2–3 hours. 2C-B is also {{considered one of the}} most painful drugs to insufflate, with users reporting intense nasal burning lasting as long as 30 minutes. The sudden intensity of the experience combined with the pain can often start the experience with a negative imprint and nausea is also increased with <b>insufflation,</b> compounding the issue.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThis {{prospective}} controlled {{study was}} designed to evaluate the effect of obesity on the plasma level of Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1) and also to evaluate the effect of CO 2 pneumoperitoneum on the plasma level of PAI- 1 in patients underwent laparoscopic surgery. MethodsThe study included two groups; first group (non obese) included 30 patients with normal average BMI underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy while the second group included 30 obese patients with BMI> 30 kg/m 2 underwent laparoscopic band ligation or fundoplication surgery. Five ml of venous blood was collected from each patient in the non obese group once before induction of anesthesia while three venous blood samples (5 ml) were collected from each patient in the obese group as follows: first sample was taken before induction of anesthesia to compare it with the non obese group, second sample was taken after 1 h of CO 2 <b>insufflations</b> (to know the effect of CO 2 <b>insufflations</b> on PAI- 1 level) and third sample was taken 1 week after surgery (to know the remaining effect in the postoperative period). ResultsThe level of PAI- 1 was significantly high (5. 423 ± 2. 5 ng/ml) in the obese patients compared to non obese patients (1. 4 ± 0. 641 ng/ml) (P value= 0. 001). The level of PAI- 1 was significantly high after CO 2 <b>insufflations</b> compared to baseline level (6. 396 ± 2. 542 ng/ml vs. 5. 423 ± 2. 5 ng/ml) in obese group (P value= 0. 001). And this level also showed significant increase up to 1 week (6. 01 ± 2. 492 ng/ml vs. 5. 423 ± 2. 5 ng/ml) (P value= 0. 028) in the obese group. ConclusionThe PAI- 1 level was higher in obese patients when compared to non obese patients. PAI- 1 level was elevated after CO 2 <b>insufflations</b> and this elevation did not reach base line level up to 1 week after laparoscopic surgery...|$|R

40|$|Congenital absence or rudiment major salivary glands, {{especially}} of the parotid glands, are a rare entity. Aplasia of parotid glands has been described alone or in association with abnormalities of other salivary glands, first branchial arch developmental disturbances and other congenital anomalies such as lacrimoauriculodentodigital syndrome, mandibulofacial dysostosis and ectodermal dysplasia. Absence is most commonly unilateral, and {{may be associated with}} accessory or rudimentary glandular tissue. There are several reported cases of isolated patulous Stensen’s duct causing air <b>insufflations</b> in the glands and recurrent parotid gland enlargement. However, in the literature there is no reported case of association of rudimentary parotid gland with a patulous Stensen’s duct.

40|$|During {{the stress}} of {{cardiopulmonary}} resuscitation (CPR), {{it is difficult to}} maintain the right rhythm and correct ratio of <b>insufflations</b> to chest compressions and to exert the compressions at a constant pressure. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate an integrated sensor system-the 2 ̆ 2 Rhythm of Life Aid 2 ̆ 2 (ROLA) to support medical staff during CPR of newborn infants. The design concept is based on interactive audio and visual feedback with consideration of functionalities and user friendliness. A prototype ROLA device is built, consisting of a transparent foil integrated with pressure sensor and electroluminescent foil actuators for indication of the exerted chest compression pressure, as well as an audio box to generate distinctive sounds as audio guidance for <b>insufflations</b> and compressions. To evaluate the performance of the ROLA device, a sensory mannequin and a dedicated software interface are implemented to give immediate feedback and record data for further processing. Tests of the ROLA prototype on the sensory mannequin by ten pairs of a doctor and a nurse at Ma´xima Medical Centre in Veldhoven, The Netherlands show that the use of ROLA device achieves a more constant rhythm and pressure of chest compressions during CPR of newborn infants...|$|R
25|$|Regnier de Graaf {{may have}} been the first to {{understand}} basic tubal function, describe hydrosalpinx, and link the development of hydrosalpinx with female infertility.

With the introduction of hysterosalpingography (1914) and tubal <b>insufflation</b> (1920) its non-surgical diagnosis became possible. Surgery was gradually displaced by IVF as the main treatment for tubal infertility after the birth of Louise Brown in 1978.|$|E
25|$|Also in 1913, Henry H. Janeway (1873–1921) {{published}} results he {{had achieved}} using a laryngoscope {{he had recently}} developed. An American anesthesiologist practicing at Bellevue Hospital in New York City, Janeway was {{of the opinion that}} direct intratracheal <b>insufflation</b> of volatile anesthetics would provide improved conditions for otolaryngologic surgery. With this in mind, he developed a laryngoscope designed {{for the sole purpose of}} tracheal intubation. Similar to Jackson's device, Janeway's instrument incorporated a distal light source. Unique however was the inclusion of batteries within the handle, a central notch in the blade for maintaining the tracheal tube in the midline of the oropharynx during intubation and a slight curve to the distal tip of the blade to help guide the tube through the glottis. The success of this design led to its subsequent use in other types of surgery. Janeway was thus instrumental in popularizing the widespread use of direct laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation in the practice of anesthesiology.|$|E
25|$|The patient lies on his/her {{left side}} with the head resting comfortably on a pillow. A mouth-guard is placed between the teeth to prevent the patient from biting on the {{endoscope}}. The endoscope is then passed over the tongue and into the oropharynx. This is the most uncomfortable stage for the patient. Quick and gentle manipulation under vision guides the endoscope into the esophagus. The endoscope is gradually advanced down the esophagus making note of any pathology. Excessive <b>insufflation</b> of the stomach is avoided at this stage. The endoscope is quickly passed through the stomach and through the pylorus to examine {{the first and second}} parts of the duodenum. Once this has been completed, the endoscope is withdrawn into the stomach and a more thorough examination is performed including a J-maneuver. This involves retroflexing the tip of the scope so it resembles a 'J' shape in order to examine the fundus and gastroesophageal junction. Any additional procedures are performed at this stage. The air in the stomach is aspirated before removing the endoscope. Still photographs can be made during the procedure and later shown to the patient to help explain any findings.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction Bochdalek hernia is a {{congenital}} defect of the diaphragm that usually presents in the neonatal period with life-threatening cardiorespiratory distress. It is rare for Bochdalek hernias {{to remain silent}} until adulthood. Once a Bochdalek hernia has been diagnosed, surgical treatment is necessary to avoid complications such as perforation and necrosis. Case presentation We present a 17 -year-old Japanese boy with left-upper-quadrant pain for two months. Chest radiography showed an elevated left hemidiaphragm. Computed tomography revealed a congenital diaphragmatic hernia. The spleen and left colon had been displaced into the left thoracic cavity through a left posterior diaphragmatic defect. We diagnosed a Bochdalek hernia. Surgical treatment was performed via a thoracoscopic approach. The boy {{was placed in the}} reverse Trendelenburg position and intrathoracic pressure was increased by CO 2 gas <b>insufflations.</b> This is a very useful procedure for reducing herniated contents {{and we were able to}} place the herniated organs safely back in the peritoneal cavity. The diaphragmatic defect was too large to close with thoracoscopic surgery alone. Small incision thoracotomy was required and primary closure was performed. His postoperative course was uneventful and there has been no recurrence of the diaphragmatic hernia to date. Conclusion Thoracoscopic surgery, performed with the boy in the reverse Trendelenburg position and using CO 2 gas <b>insufflations</b> in the thoracic cavity, was shown to be useful for Bochdalek hernia repair. </p...|$|R
30|$|Control animals {{experienced}} increased creatinine concentration, heart rate, and CVP. Nevertheless, {{these were}} minor changes and probably {{caused by the}} sham operative procedures. Accordingly, significant difference in organ damage between the control group and the intervention groups must be caused by IAH. Furthermore, control animals showed no increase in IBP after the sham procedures. Therefore, these animals must have been sedated {{to such a degree}} that muscle contractions did not increase the IAP. Any IAH observed in our animals was thus likely to be caused by the CO 2 <b>insufflations</b> or the placement of extra volume in the experimental groups.|$|R
500|$|According to the US {{government}} {{classification of}} psychiatric medications, bupropion is [...] "non-abusable". However, in animal studies, squirrel monkeys and rats could be induced to self-administer bupropion intravenously, {{which is often}} taken {{as a sign of}} addiction potential. There {{have been a number of}} anecdotal and case-study reports of bupropion abuse, but the bulk of evidence indicates that the subjective effects of bupropion via the oral route are markedly different from those of addictive stimulants such as cocaine or amphetamine. That said, bupropion, via non-conventional routes of administration (e.g., injection, <b>insufflation),</b> is reported to be abused in the United States and Canada, notably in prisons.|$|E
500|$|The easiest {{method to}} perform this {{technique}} is the needle cricothyrotomy (also {{referred to as a}} percutaneous dilational cricothyrotomy), in which a large-bore (12–14 gauge) intravenous catheter is used to puncture the cricothyroid membrane. Oxygen can then be administered through this catheter via jet <b>insufflation.</b> However, while needle cricothyrotomy may be life-saving in extreme circumstances, {{this technique is}} only intended to be a temporizing measure until a definitive airway can be established. While needle cricothyrotomy can provide adequate oxygenation, the small diameter of the cricothyrotomy catheter is insufficient for elimination of carbon dioxide (ventilation). After one hour of apneic oxygenation through a needle cricothyrotomy, one can expect a PaCO2 of greater than 250mm Hg and an arterial pH of less than 6.72, despite an oxygen saturation of 98% or greater. A more definitive airway can be established by performing a surgical cricothyrotomy, in which a [...] endotracheal tube or tracheostomy tube can be inserted through a larger incision.|$|E
500|$|The {{occupancy}} of dopamine transporter (DAT) sites by bupropion and its metabolites in {{the human}} brain as measured by positron emission tomography was 26% according to GlaxoSmithKline researchers and 14% in an independent study. However, despite this reported weak DAT occupancy, a subsequent study looked at the actual extracellular concentrations of dopamine {{in the human}} brain after an acute oral treatment of bupropion and failed to observe any increase, concluding that the weak DAT occupancy was not sufficient to increase dopamine levels. In contrast, the same study also looked at dopamine levels in the rat brain after administration of bupropion via intraperitoneal injection and did see an increase, {{which could have been}} related to species differences. An alternative explanation is that the difference {{had to do with the}} different routes of administration employed (i.e., oral vs. i.p.) and the associated differences in pharmacokinetics and metabolism, namely, the bypassing of first-past metabolism with the latter route, that resulted. Although oral bupropion at clinical doses does not appear to have a significant potential for abuse, there are many isolated case reports of bupropion abuse and [...] "cocaine-like" [...] effects in humans who ingested the drug via a non-oral route (e.g., injection, <b>insufflation,</b> etc.). Notably, awareness of the abuse potential of bupropion via non-conventional routes appears to be especially prominent in correctional facilities.|$|E
30|$|The bladder {{catheterisation}} {{preceding the}} Veress needle insertion, an elementary safety step prior to siting instruments into the peritoneal cavity, was not recorded in 49 % (33) of cases.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the article is to {{establish}} adequacy of protection of energy metabolism in a patient under anaes-thesiology in cholecystectomy from mini-access. Material et methods: 122 patients subjected to cholecystectomy from mini access have been surveyed. Among them 92 patients have got intravenous general anaesthesia with AVL, 30 patients have got prolonged epidural anaesthesia on spontaneous breath with <b>insufflations</b> of oxygen through an obverse mask with sedatations. Monitoring of energy-plastic metabolism {{has been carried out}} in all patients. Results: Groups of patients have been compared by anthropometrical data, traumatic interventions. In both groups of patients loss of energy to traumatic to an operation stage has insignificantly increased, but after the anaesthesia termination in the group of patients with intravenous anaesthesia loss of energy continued to rise, and in the group of patients with prolonged epidural blockade it has returned to the initial level. After the anaesthesia termination the energy metabolism became essential higher in the first group of patients in comparison with the second one (p < 0, 01). The energy-plastic metabolism increased in the first group of patients and decreased in the second. PEA during cholecystectomy from mini access provided a stable condition of energy and energy-plastic metabolism. The conclusion: The inspection of 122 patients subjected to cholecystectomy from mini access has established the following data: PEA on spontaneous breath with <b>insufflations</b> of oxygen through an obverse mask in comparison with intravenous general anaesthesia and AVL allows keeping on an optimum level of energy and energy-plastic metabolism...|$|R
