40|$|For {{the past}} 30 years, {{the size of}} a metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect-transistor (MOSFET) in very-large-scale {{integrated}} circuits (VLSI) continued to scale down for higher integration and higher performance. As the gate length of MOSFETs has reached down to sub- 50 nm, unprecedented technical issues have become prominent to proceed scaling of the MOSFETs. Silicon single-electron transistor/single-hole transistor (SET/SHT) {{is one of the most}} promising devices for VLSI in silicon nanotechnology; the technology that seeks new function in nano structures. Although its operation principle is different from conventional MOSFETs, its fabrication process is very similar to them. Hence, it is expected that SETs/SHTs can be easily combined with CMOS VLSI and realize high functional, ultra-low power, and ultra-high density circuits. Owing to the intensive researches on SETs/SHTs, process techniques for SETs/SHTs to operate at room temperature have been establishes. In such room-temperature operating SETs/SHTs, strong quantum effect has become pronounced and started to affect the transport characteristics. However, basic analysis and enhancement of the device performance are still required for room-temperature-operating SETs/SHTs to be used in actual VLSI circuits. The objective of this work is to analyze the characteristics of the room-temperature-operating SETs/SHTs and apply them to further enhance their advantages for VLSI circuit applications. The feasibilities of the proposed methods are evaluated by simulations and measurements. An analytical SET/SHT model with discrete quantum energy levels has been proposed and developed. The model is compact enough to be expressed in closed-form, thus it does not require numerical calculation. As discrete quantum levels are introduced, it can successfully reproduce NDC characteristics and non-periodic Coulomb oscillations. The model is accurate compared to the conventional full master equation method and the measured data. Also, the model can be incorporated into the HSPICE simulation. The proposed analytical model is promising to provide suitable environments for designing CMOS-combined room-temperature- operating highly-functional SET circuits. The relationship between the FWHM of the NDC and voltage gain has been newly found by the experiments and calculations. The high gain SETs/SHTs show small FWHM in NDC. Therefore, NDC characteristics can be controlled by the basic capacitance parameters. Low <b>drain</b> <b>coupling</b> in the high gain SETs/SHTs is considered to be the most possible origin. High-gain SETs/SHTs can realize low supply voltage in NDC circuits while they still have advantages in the standard logic circuits. Sharpness (FWHM) of Coulomb blockade oscillation peak has been electrically modulated in a SHT at room temperature to enhance the functionality of the present SETs/SHTs after the device fabrication. In order to achieve the function, substrate capacitance is changed by controlling the substrate condition between depletion and accumulation (inversion) in a thin BOX SOI substrate. The proposed scheme can be applied to the novel analog pattern matching device. 報告番号: 甲 23452; 学位授与年月日: 2008 - 03 - 24; 学位の種別: 課程博士; 学位の種類: 博士(工学); 学位記番号: 博工第 6768 号; 研究科・専攻: 工学系研究科電子工学専...|$|E

40|$|Efficient RNA {{delivery}} to targeted cells requires {{the use of}} stable interactive carriers that provide RNA protection during the extracellular transit and trigger release once internalised. One strategy to avoid the premature extracellular RNA <b>drain</b> <b>coupled</b> to sufficient intracellular release is the use of stimuli-responsive delivery materials exploiting as a triggering mechanism the redox gradient between the extra- and intracellular compartments. This work describes a facile route for preparation of redox-active nanocarriers containing disulphides that combine RNA protection and delivery on demand based on intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels. A one-step sonochemical technology was employed to generate thiolated chitosan (TC) nanocapsules with diameter between 250 - 570 nm and simultaneously load them with RNA. Their size and physiological stability were directly proportional to the extent of disulphide cross-linking, which in turn could be ruled by adjusting the processing pH and degree of chitosan thiolation. The TC processing into nanocapsules showed to be advantageous in terms of RNA condensation and protection compared to the typically employed nanocomplexation. Fluorescence microscopy imaging revealed that: i) the nanocapsules enter the human fibroblasts and migrate to the perinuclear regions within 1 h, and ii) the cargo release occurs after the internalisation. These redox-responsive and biocompatible drug carriers demonstrated an effective (~ 60 %) and sustained (up to 72 h) RNA release at intracellular GSH concentrations (10 mM) in vitro, based on disulphide reduction and consequent capsules disassembly.

Capacitive coupling ratios have been usually adopted to model floating gate (FG) memory cells, {{in particular to}} deduce the value of FG potential. Now they are determined {{by means of a}} new model (recently proposed in the literature), starting from a new procedure to evaluate the FG potential.

40|$|AbstractThe use of {{controlled}} modulus columns (CMC) is gaining increased {{popularity in the}} support of rail and road bridge approach embankments on soft soils. The further columns are driven into the competent firm soils, the further the design will rely on the inclusions to take {{the bulk of the}} vertical loads, as they become rigid inclusions. The advantage of this design approach is that it produces increased control over the settlement, but as a result the columns will attract greater loads, including bending moment and shear force in situations where non-uniform loading or ground conditions exist. The load on the composite soil-CMC is uniformly distributed by the upper layer of granular load transfer platform (LTP), which also includes a layer of reinforcement. Finite difference program FLAC 3 D has been used to numerically simulate an embankment on the improved ground with end-bearing CMC. A geosynthetic reinforcement layer has been simulated using the inbuilt FLAC 3 D geogrid element. In this paper, a comparison has been made between the <b>drained</b> and <b>coupled</b> flow-deformation analyses.

40|$|The {{consolidation}} {{behavior of}} ground with vertical drains {{is known to}} be greatly affected by the finite permeability of the sand drains, also called the effect of well resistance. However, up to now, no analytical methods have been reported for evaluating this effect on the nonlinear consolidation behavior of vertical drains. In this paper, by considering the nonlinear compressibility and permeability of soil during consolidation, the effect of well resistance was incorporated into the derivation of the equations that govern the nonlinear consolidation of a vertical <b>drain</b> with <b>coupled</b> radial-vertical flow. In addition, the smear effect was considered by assuming three decay patterns for the radial permeability coefficients of the soil toward the sand drain in the smeared zone. After obtaining the governing equations, a simplified analytical solution is derived for a general time-variable surcharge loading. Based on the general solution obtained, detailed solutions are provided for three special types of loading schemes: constant loading, single-stage loading, and multi-stage loading. The validity of the solution is verified by reducing it to several special cases and comparing these to existing solutions. Finally, the effect of the well resistance, the ratios of the compression index to the radial and vertical permeability indices, various loading schemes, and various variation patterns of the radial permeability coefficient of the soil in the smeared soil zone are investigated using parametric analysis...|$|R

40|$|High-resolution blood oxygen level {{dependent}} (BOLD) functional {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (fMRI) at the sub-millimeter scale has become feasible with recent advances in MR technology. In principle, this would enable the study of layered cortical circuits, one of the fundaments of cortical computation. However, the spatial layout of cortical blood supply may become an important confound at such high resolution. In particular, venous blood draining back to the cortical surface perpendicularly to the layered structure is expected to influence the measured responses in different layers.

40|$|Using {{embedded}} SRAM as a path, FinFET {{may enter}} manufacturing at 32 nm. FinFET provides several advantages over the planar MOSFET structure [...] smaller size, larger current, smaller leakage, and less variation in threshold voltage. A compact model of multi-gate transistors will facilitate their adoption. BSIM-MG is a surface-potential based compact model of multi-gate MOSFETs fabricated on either SOI or bulk substrates. The effects of body doping are modeled. It can also model a double-gate transistor with independently biased {{front and back}} gates and asymmetric front and back gate work-functions and dielectric thicknesses. 1 Advantages of FinFET over Planar MOSFET What makes a transistor different from a resistor is that the gate controls the conduction channel, not the drain. The gate exerts its control through capacitive (electrostatic) coupling to the channel. When we shrink the MOSFET gate to a smaller size, the drain is pulled closer to the (middle of the) channel. That increases the capacitive <b>coupling</b> between the <b>drain</b> and the channel. When the transistor is too small, the <b>drain</b> has enough <b>coupling</b> to the channel that a current (leakage current) flows with only a drain voltage applied without a gate voltage. This is the problem facing the planar transistor structure, which has not changed for four decades. FinFET [1] allows the gate to control the channel from several sides (see Fig. 1), thus increasing the gate control and allows the gate length to be reduced further. Since the introduction of FinFET, this structure {{has been used to}} set new world record of smallest gate length several times at various research laboratories.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a simple method for representing upward capillary fluxes from shallow groundwater into the unsaturated soil column of the large-scale hydrological models generally used at low resolution in global climate models. The groundwater scheme {{implemented in the}} Total Runoff Integrating Pathways river-routing model in a previous study is coupled with the Interaction between Soil Biosphere Atmosphere (ISBA) land surface model. In this coupling, the simulated water table depth acts as the lower boundary condition for the soil moisture diffusive equation. An original parameterization accounting for the subgrid topography inside each grid cell is proposed in order to compute this fully coupled soil lower boundary condition. The impact of this coupling on the simulated water budget is evaluated over France for the 1989 – 2009 period. Simulations are performed at high (1 / 12 °) and low (0. 5 °) resolutions. Upward capillary fluxes induce {{a decrease in the}} simulated recharge from ISBA to the aquifers and contributes to an enhancement of the soil moisture memory. The simulated water table depths are then lowered, which induces a slight decrease in the simulated mean annual river discharges. These differences do not affect the comparison with observations.

40|$|Introduction Low Impact Development (LID) is an {{alternative}} approach in managing stormwater runoff. Its main philosophy is to replicate the pre-development hydrological properties of water catchment. It seeks to first infiltrate, filter, store and retaining the surface runoff near to its source before draining it to downstream. Some of the common LIDs include green roofs, permeable pavement, vegetated swales, infiltration drains, bioretention cells (also known as rain gardens). While LID {{seems to be a}} viable solution to reduce the flooding problem, we would like to investigate its performance after the LID (in particular infiltration drain system) has been put into operation for some time. A case study in Prinsejagt, Eindhoven will be used as data from previous studies is available to allow for comparison on the performance of infiltration drains after ~ 10 years of installation. Problem definition Infiltration drain has been used in Netherlands quite extensive, it is important to find out its current performance after years of operation. Existing researches or studies of infiltration drain system concentrate on its performance when it is newly installed. Studies that look into performance of an existing system which has been put into operation for quite some time are still quite rare. Research My research focused on determining the percentage reduction in exfiltration rate at the measurement site as compared to initial readings derived from previous research. It involves the monitoring of water levels at the same locations of the infiltration (IT) drain system in Prinsejagt (as carried out the previous monitoring scheme in 2003) and to carry out IT drain model simulations. In addition, we also conducted closed-loop test at four selected stretches of infiltration pipes to ascertain the exfiltration properties of the particular stretch of pipe. First, we seek to explain the phenomenon observed at our monitoring site qualitatively before applying quantitative approaches (like graphical, curve-fitting and simulation methods) to assess the percentage reduction in exfiltration rates at the monitoring locations. Based on the projected clogging rate, simulations were carried out to predict the future system exfiltration rate. Results 1. System behaviour (of the IT <b>drains</b> network) <b>coupled</b> with the influence of groundwater level determine the overall performance of the IT drain system. 2. Individual IT pipes exhibit more varied rates of exfiltration (due to different localized conditions) 3. Verified that linear mathematical function can adequately describe the water level trends to an accuracy of 0. 01 m RMSE for all monitoring locations 4. Observed a 9. 4 % drop in exfiltration rate [L 3 /T] in the IT drain model. By 2021, the exfiltration rate is expected to drop by 20 % from its starting value. Conclusions and recommendations Regular maintenanceto clear the accumulated sediment inside IT drains and thereafter monitoring of performanceshould be carried out so as to determine its effectivenessin increasing the overall permeability. Moreover, water quality monitoring in IT drain system could be implemented to prevent any contamination to groundwater resources. In lowering the pipe invert level of the entire IT system, the IT system performance can be enhanced during low groundwater period.
