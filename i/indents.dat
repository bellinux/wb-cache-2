Two types of indenters (hemispherical <b>indenter</b> and pyramidal <b>indenter)</b> with dimensions of several nanometres have been modelled. The simulation results have shown that the <b>indenter</b> shape significantly influences the nanoindentation behaviours at such small scale. The indentation force increases with indentation depth during loading for the hemispheri-cal <b>indenter,</b> while the indentation force is low in values for the pyramidal <b>indenter.</b> To validate the MD model nanoindentation experiments have been carried out.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Indenter</b> {{size effect}} on the {{incipient}} plasticity of Al (001) surface is studied by using the quasicontinuum simulation method. Two cylindrical indenters with the radii 2. 5 nm and 40 nm are used to penetrate the surface respectively, and in displacement-control in steps of 0. 02 nm. Results show that the plasticity under the small <b>indenter</b> is activated by discrete dislocation nucleation events, while the plasticity under the large <b>indenter</b> is dominated by a collective dislocation activity. Contact pressure calculations reveal that reversible incipient plasticity occurs under the small <b>indenter,</b> i. e. the plastically deformed surface can completely recover upon withdrawal of the <b>indenter,</b> while the incipient plasticity under the large <b>indenter</b> seems to be irreversible...|$|R
