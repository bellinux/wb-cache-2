30|$|By {{employing}} {{the methods of}} molecular mechanics, semi-empirical quantum-chemical РМ 3 and Monte-Carlo, the positioning of monocyclopentadienylferrum (II) molecules in double-walled (5, 5)@(10, 10) carbon nanotubes (CNT) depending on their concentration and temperature has been studied. The molecules have been found out to form stable bonds with CNT walls, with a tendency between <b>intercalate</b> stability and the CNT structure. The temperature growth (over ~ 500  K) causes gradual bond ruining followed by extrusion of interwall <b>intercalate.</b> Further temperature increase up to 600 – 700  K is characterised with <b>intercalate</b> external surface desorption, stabilising the whole system and keeping the interwall <b>intercalate</b> only. The CNT’s UV-spectrum (5, 5)@(10, 10) depending on the <b>intercalate</b> concentration and association constant of the “double-walled CNT–intercalate” system have been calculated. A combination of unique optical, electrical and magnetic behaviour of cyclopentadienyl complexes with their ability to form high-stable <b>intercalate</b> with CNT opens a prospect of their applying in nanotechnology.|$|R

5|$|There are {{two types}} of cells in cardiac muscle: muscle cells which have the ability to {{contract}} easily, and pacemaker cells of the conducting system. The muscle cells make up the bulk (99%) of cells in the atria and ventricles. These contractile cells are connected by <b>intercalated</b> discs which allow a rapid response to impulses of action potential from the pacemaker cells. The <b>intercalated</b> discs allow the cells to act as a syncytium and enable the contractions that pump blood through the heart and into the major arteries. The pacemaker cells make up 1% of cells and form the conduction system of the heart. They are generally much smaller than the contractile cells and have few myofibrils which gives them limited contractibility. Their function is similar in many respects to neurons. Cardiac muscle tissue has autorhythmicity, the unique ability to initiate a cardiac action potential at a fixed rate – spreading the impulse rapidly from cell to cell to trigger the contraction of the entire heart.|$|E

As one of the events within the ancient pentathlon, the history of the discus throw dates back to 708 BC.
