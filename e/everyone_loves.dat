She also said Naomi was good at turning a situation to her advantage, and likened her to a cat, as she enjoys the [...] "finer things in life". The actress continued, [...] "On top of all that, she is her mother's daughter. She has the Canning straight up, strength and vulgarity that her genes and upbringing have given her in spades. She's quirky but sophisticated, and at times petulant and silly. All in all, she is very, very fun to play."

The album also features songs written by Ed Sheeran, Kelly Clarkson, and Tom Fletcher. In May 2011, Kotecha spoke to Digital Spy, and he elaborated that One Direction were [...] "experimenting" [...] with sounds on their debut album. Kotecha {{said that he was}} involved in the [...] "early stages" [...] of producing the record. [...] "The stuff I've heard has been really catchy and <b>everyone</b> <b>loves</b> the guys, so it's just about capturing that in the music, which I think is what they're going to be doing." [...] Sonny Takhar, {{the chief executive officer of}} Syco Records, in an August 2011 issue of Music Week, described the recording process as a [...] "very intensive period" [...] for the group.

The twins' inclusion in the final 12 was a controversial decision, due to their lack of experience, but Walsh stood by them, saying [...] "I don't know how people can hate two nice young kids from Ireland. They've been edited really badly and come across as the people <b>everyone</b> <b>loves</b> to hate... but they're just raw, naïve and innocent {{and they have the}} potential to be really good."

[...] However, she praised the positive aspects of Kirito's character, and his [...] "competent and noble" [...] self distinguishes him from other harem protagonists in that he actually earns the girls' affection.

And there's sort of a subtler and more complicated dynamic between them". As Buffy struggles with her unwanted position of mentor to the Potential Slayers, the writers used Faith to create an outside conflict about Buffy's leadership abilities. Although Faith is questioning Buffy and her choices she is making, she is no longer an enemy to her either. In the episode [...] "Empty Places", the Potentials lose trust in Buffy and appoint Faith as their leader instead, a decision that literally blows up in their faces. As Drew Goddard explains, [...] "Faith is like the cool aunt that <b>everyone</b> <b>loves,</b> because the cool aunt doesn't have the responsibility of raising the children.
