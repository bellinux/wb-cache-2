6000|$|Thus {{it was at}} {{all events}} that, one morning some dozen days after the dinner in the Boulevard Malesherbes at which Madame de Vionnet had been present with her daughter, he was called upon to play his part in an {{encounter}} that deeply stirred his imagination. He had the habit, in these contemplations, of watching a fellow visitant, here and there, from a respectable distance, remarking some note of behaviour, of penitence, of prostration, of the absolved, relieved state; this was {{the manner in which}} his vague tenderness took its course, the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>demonstration</b> to which it naturally had to confine itself. It hadn't indeed so felt its responsibility as when on this occasion he suddenly measured the suggestive effect of a lady whose supreme stillness, in the shade of one of the chapels, he had two or three times noticed as he made, and made once more, his slow circuit. She wasn't prostrate--not in any degree bowed, but she was strangely fixed, and her prolonged immobility showed her, while he passed and paused, as wholly given up to the need, whatever it was, that had brought her there. She only sat and gazed before her, as he himself often sat; but she had placed herself, as he never did, within the focus of the shrine, and she had lost herself, he could easily see, as he would only have liked to do. She was not a wandering alien, keeping back more than she gave, but one of the familiar, the intimate, the fortunate, for whom these dealings had a method and a meaning. She reminded our friend--since it was the way of nine tenths of his current impressions to act as recalls of things imagined--of some fine firm concentrated heroine of an old story, something he had heard, read, something that, had he had a hand for drama, he might himself have written, renewing her courage, renewing her clearness, in splendidly-protected meditation. Her back, as she sat, was turned to him, but his impression absolutely required that she should be young and interesting, and she carried her head moreover, even in the sacred shade, with a discernible faith in herself, a kind of implied conviction of consistency, security, impunity. But what had such a woman come for if she hadn't come to pray? Strether's reading of such matters was, it must be owned, confused; but he wondered if her attitude were some congruous fruit of absolution, of [...] "indulgence." [...] He knew but dimly what indulgence, in such a place, might mean; yet he had, as with a soft sweep, a vision of how it might indeed add to the zest of active rites. All this was a good deal to have been denoted by a mere lurking figure who was nothing to him; but, the last thing before leaving the church, he had the surprise of a still deeper quickening.|$|E

40|$|The work {{reported}} {{deals with}} the problem of operating a robot manipulator under a rate control mode while the end effector is not in contact with the external environment, and then switching to a force control mode when contact is made. The paper details how the modal changeover may be accomplished in a manner transparent to the operator, and will allow operator applied forces to be reflected at the robot end effector. A one <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> freedom <b>demonstration</b> system is used to illustrate the concept, which is then applied to a PUMA manipulator. Sample code for the implementation of the control is provided, experimental results show that the optimum setting for the gain {{is a function of the}} compliance of the end effector, and the compliance of the external constraint...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this paper is intended as an introduction to a study being carried out at the University of Bristol in conjunction with the SEAS DTC and forms the basis for a PhD in aerospace engineering. The focus of the research is the design of control systems for small unmanned rotary wing vehicles which receive feedback signals from visual sensory devices to augment controllability. Over the course of the work, three experiments are planned in 1, 2 and 6 <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom in order to incrementally increase the demands on the visual control system and develop an in depth understanding of the Taleos vision system, supplied by BAE Systems, to be used. To date, 1 <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> freedom experiments have been carried out and have demonstrated the potential for using vision for control. The work has now been extended to 2 <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom, with the theoretical simulation of an appropriately restrained helicopter.

40|$|Whereas it {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that the adult cortex is capable <b>of</b> a remarkable <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> functional plasticity, <b>demonstrations</b> <b>of</b> accompanying structural changes have been limited. We examined the basal dendritic field morphology of dye-filled neurons in layers III and IV of the mature barrel cortex after vibrissal-deafferentation in adult rats. Eight weeks later, the tendency for these neurons to orient their dendritic arbors {{toward the center of}} their home barrel was found to be disrupted by the resultant reduced activity of thalamocortical innervation. Measures of spine density and total dendritic length were normal, indicating that the loss of dendritic bias was accompanied by growth of dendrites directed away from the barrel center. This finding suggests that in the mature cortex, the apparently static structural attributes of the normal adult cortex depend on maintenance of patterns of afferent activity; with the corollary that changes in these patterns can induce structural plasticity...|$|R
40|$|Delta is an {{object-oriented}} code architecture {{based on}} the finite element method which enables simulation {{of a wide range}} of engineering mechanics problems in a parallel processing environment. Written in C{sup ++}, Delta is a natural framework for algorithm development and for research involving coupling of mechanics from different Engineering Science disciplines. To enhance flexibility and encourage code reuse, the architecture provides a clean separation of the major aspects of finite element programming. Spatial discretization, temporal discretization, and the solution of linear and nonlinear systems of equations are each implemented separately, independent from the governing field equations. Other attractive features of the Delta architecture include support for constitutive models with internal variables, reusable ``matrix-free`` equation solvers, and support for region-to-region variations in the governing equations and the active <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom. A <b>demonstration</b> code built from the Delta architecture has been used in two-dimensional and three-dimensional simulations involving dynamic and quasi-static solid mechanics, transient and steady heat transport, and flow in porous media...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{looks into}} {{whether there are}} any {{differences}} in <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> attentiveness between different generations and different cultures. By attentiveness I mean a demonstrator’s preemptive response to a beneficiary’s verbal/non-verbal cues or situations surrounding a beneficiary and a demonstrator, which {{takes the form of}} offering. When and how often one would demonstrate attentiveness may vary according to such factors as generation and culture. Three groups of people from different generations and different cultural backgrounds (Japanese and Americans) served as the participants (280 people for the questionnaire data and 18 people for the interview data). It was investigated whether there were any differences among the participants in <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> attentiveness, in the reasons for <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> attentiveness, and in rating <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> imposition to demonstrate attentiveness. It was also examined whether there was any relationship between <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> imposition to demonstrate attentiveness and <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> attentiveness; and in which relationship (the relationship between a demonstrator and a beneficiary of attentiveness varied from very familiar to not very familiar at all) attentiveness was demonstrated. The data were collected using a questionnaire with six situations, based on field notes; and the interviews were conducted using the same six situations. The results show that in most situations there were no major differences among the participants in the choice <b>of</b> <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> attentiveness and the reasons for it. The participants chose to demonstrate attentiveness in four situations in the questionnaire, because they wanted to be of help to the other party. There was a relationship between <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> imposition to demonstrate attentiveness and <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> attentiveness in four situations. Overall, the interview data confirmed the questionnaire data...|$|R
