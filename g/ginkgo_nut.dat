Nico-N was treated {{in the form of}} chewing gum to 36 healthy male smokers with at least 2 years of smoking history. Urine analysis showed that cotinine concentration of smokers treated with Nico-N increased dose dependently compared to the non-treated control group. Cotinine, a nontoxic metabolite of nicotine, could be removed from the body in urine. Increase of the cotinine production from the smokers treated with Nico-N indicates the detoxification effect of Nico-N against nicotine.|$|E
40|$|Ginkgo biloba L. {{is among}} the oldest species of trees on earth. Various parts of the tree {{have a history of}} use in {{prevention}} of cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. However, most of the current scientific research is focused on the Ginkgo leaf extract. Thus, we tested the effect of Ginkgo nuts on lipid metabolism as a therapeutic for cardiovascular diseases. Four preparations of Ginkgo nuts (whole nuts, their methanol extract and its lipid and water soluble fractions) were tested using Human Hepatoma cells (Hep G 2) and in vivo mouse feeding study. <b>Ginkgo</b> <b>nut</b> preparation may modulate serum cholesterol levels by modulating Apolipoprotein B secretion as well as low-density lipoprotein receptor in the liver. From mouse feeding trial, <b>Ginkgo</b> <b>nut</b> supplementation, as whole nuts, reduced the levels of hepatic cholesterol while increasing serum cholesterol compared to control. The lipid soluble fraction was responsible for decreased hepatic cholesterol, while the water soluble fraction may contribute to increased serum cholesterol. The lipid soluble fraction of <b>Ginkgo</b> <b>nut</b> may have potential to be used for the purpose of prevention of cardiovascular diseases. This is the first report investigating the effects of Ginkgo nuts on cholesterol metabolism...|$|E

However, judging from the listed seasonings they used for these dishes, such as pepper, ginger, soya sauce, oil, salt, and vinegar, Song era cuisine is perhaps not too different from the Chinese cuisine of today. Other additional seasonings and ingredients included walnuts, turnips, crushed Chinese cardamon kernels, fagara, olives, <b>ginkgo</b> <b>nuts,</b> citrus zest, and sesame oil.|$|R

40|$|Alternative therapy {{including}} herbal {{drugs and}} complementary medicine is becoming increasingly popular. However, {{the rise in the}} incidence of herb-drug interactions is causing concern, especially in the absence of warning labels addressing potential adverse effects. We present he case of a 55 -year-old male who suffered a fatal breakthrough seizure, with no evidence of non-compliance with his anticonvulsant medications. The autopsy report revealed sub-therapeutic serum levels for both anticonvulsants Depakote | and Dilantin |. Concomitant with his prescribed medications, the decedent was also self-medicating with a cornucopia of herbal supplements and nutraceuticals, prominent among which was Ginkgo biloba. Ginkgo, an herbal extract from the leaves of the Ginkgo biloba tree, has been used medicinally for centuries and has been touted as a cure for a variety of medical conditions. The induction of Cytochrome P 450 enzymes by components of herbal drugs has been known to affect the metabolism of various drugs. Dilantin is primarily metabolized by CYP 2 C 9, and secondarily metabolized by CYP 2 C 19. Valproate metabolism is also m dulated in part by CYP 2 C 9 and CYP 2 C 19. A recent study revealed significant inductive effect of ginkgo on CYP 2 C 19 activity. CYP 2 C 19 induction by ginkgo could be a plausible explanation for the subtherapeutic levels of Dilantin and Depakote. Additionally, <b>ginkgo</b> <b>nuts</b> contain a potent neurotoxin, which is known to induce seizure activity. Evidence of other herbal drugs diminishing the efficacy of anticonvulsant medication does exist; however, there has been only one other documented instance of ginkgo potentiating seizure activity in the presence of anticonvulsant therapy. Highlighting the potential adverse effects and drug interactions of ginkgo on the packaging of the drug may help prevent inadvertent use in vulnerable individuals...|$|R
40|$|The Ginkgo biloba is one {{of ancient}} trees that exists from billions of years ago, its leaf and nut are used as herbs and foods in China, while so far its pollen {{does not have any}} {{application}} except pollination. In order to evaluate the antioxidant activity of Ginkgo biloba pollen, and rapidly screen its antioxidative components, the 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging ability, total flavonoid, total phenol, and proanthocyanidin of Ginkgo biloba pollen were determined and compared with those of Ginkgo biloba leaf and nut, and the off-line DPPH-HPLC-PAD and HPLC-ESI-MS 2 were applied for screening and identifying the antioxidant flavonoids in Ginkgo biloba pollen. The results showed that the DPPH scavenging ability of Ginkgo biloba pollen was much higher than <b>Ginkgo</b> biloba <b>nut,</b> but lower than Ginkgo biloba leaf, while the total content of flavonoid in Ginkgo biloba pollen was approximately 4. 37 times higher than in Ginkgo biloba leaf. Further studies found that the major flavonol aglycone in Ginkgo biloba pollen was kaempferol, which accounted for 96. 71 % of the total aglycones (includes quercetin, kaempferol and isorhamnetin), and the main flavonoid components in Ginkgo biloba pollen were flavonoid glycosides. Finally, ten antioxidant peaks were screened and identified to be flavonoids (including kaempferol and nine flavonoid glycosides), so flavonoids were likely to be the main antioxidant components in GP, and among them, three novel kaempferol glycosides (peaks 1, 2, and 3) were found in Ginkgo biloba pollen for the first time, which had never been found in Ginkgo biloba...|$|R
