5|$|The king, {{shocked and}} dejected, {{returned}} to the palace since he had already anointed his son, Devavrata, as heir apparent. Devavrata was distressed by his father's condition; he learned about the promise asked by the fisherman-chief from a minister. Immediately, Devavrata rushed to the hut of the fisherman-chief and begged for Satyvati's hand on his father's behalf. The fisherman repeated his condition and told Devavrata that only Shantanu was worthy of Satyavati; he had rejected marriage proposals <b>from</b> <b>even</b> Brahmarishis like Asita.|$|E
5|$|Another {{argument}} for sociality {{is based on}} the healed injuries in several Smilodon fossils, which would suggest that the animals needed others to provide it food. This argument has been questioned, as cats can recover quickly <b>from</b> <b>even</b> severe bone damage and an injured Smilodon could survive if it had access to water. The brain of Smilodon was relatively small compared to other cat species. Some researchers have argued that Smilodons brain would have been too small for it to have been a social animal. An analysis of brain size in living big cats found no correlation between brain size and sociality. Another argument against Smilodon being social is that being an ambush hunter in closed habitat would likely have made group-living unnecessary, as in most modern cats. Yet it has also been proposed that being the largest predator in an environment comparable to the savanna of Africa, Smilodon may have had a social structure similar to modern lions, which possibly live in groups primarily to defend optimal territory from other lions (lions are the only social big cats today).|$|E
5|$|The team started well, {{coming in}} third place in the team time trial in Stage 1, putting Leipheimer and Armstrong 13 seconds off the race lead. In the first {{mountain}} stage three days later, Leipheimer finished with Popovych and Horner with {{the same time as}} stage winner Danilo Di Luca, while Armstrong lost 15 seconds. The next day, Armstrong lost nearly three minutes and effectively lost any chance in the General Classification, while Leipheimer remained within ten seconds of stage winner Denis Menchov. Leipheimer was fourth overall after that stage and remained there until Stage 12, the very long and irregular individual time trial in Cinque Terre, where he was the only rider within a minute of the winning time put up by Menchov and moved to third overall. Horner withdrew from the race after Stage 10, after sustaining a leg injury that for a time prevented him <b>from</b> <b>even</b> being able to stand.|$|E

5|$|The thin {{long legs}} of the {{hartebeest}} provide for a quick escape in an open habitat; if attacked, the formidable horns are used {{to ward off the}} predator. The elevated position of the eyes enables the hartebeest to inspect its surroundings continuously even as it is grazing. The muzzle has evolved so as to derive maximum nutrition <b>from</b> <b>even</b> a frugal diet. The horns are also used during fights among males for dominance in the breeding season; the clash of the horns is loud enough that it can be heard from hundreds of metres away. The beginning of a fight is marked with a series of head movements and stances, as well as depositing droppings on dung piles. The opponents drop onto their knees and, after giving a hammer-like blow, begin wrestling, their horns interlocking. One attempts to fling the head of the other to one side to stab the neck and shoulders with his horns. Fights are rarely serious, but can be fatal if they are.|$|E
5|$|During these {{difficult}} years, Boosey {{was supported by}} his trusted managing director, Ernst Roth. However, Roth later regarded the Boosey family as ineffectual and parochial. In the early 1960s, Roth forced Boosey's sons Anthony and Simon out of the company, and prevented his youngest son, Nigel, <b>from</b> <b>even</b> joining, allegedly {{at the behest of}} Benjamin Britten. Roth and Boosey also had differences over Britten's influence over the company. Roth regarded Britten as a gifted local musician, rather than a true genius like Roth's friends Strauss and Stravinsky. Boosey realised how valuable Britten was to the company, and agreed to Britten's request to divide the company into instruments and publishing. However, Britten humiliated Boosey by preventing him from chairing the music publishing board Boosey had established at Britten's request. In 1963, Britten also managed to get Boosey & Hawkes to employ Donald Mitchell to find new, young composers for the company. Angered by the sway Britten had over Boosey, Roth fired Mitchell within a year. Mitchell later set up Faber Music for book publisher Faber and Faber with the assistance of Britten and the blessing of T. S. Eliot.|$|E

25|$|Protecting {{the brain}} <b>from</b> <b>even</b> minor {{disruption}} is important since exercise depends upon motor control, and particularly, because humans are bipeds, the motor control needed for keeping balance.

2500|$|The Baraita {{reported}} that another interpretation held that [...] taught {{that no other}} service was valid <b>from</b> <b>evening</b> to morning apart from kindling the Menorah. [...] For [...] says: “Aaron and his sons shall set it in order, to burn <b>from</b> <b>evening</b> to morning,” and this implies that “it” – and no other thing – shall be <b>from</b> <b>evening</b> to morning. Thus, the Gemara concluded that nothing may come after the kindling of the lights, and consequently the slaughtering of the Passover offering must happen before. [...] And the Gemara likened the burning of incense to the kindling of the Menorah, holding that just as no service could follow lighting the Menorah, so no service could follow burning the incense. And because the Gemara likened the burning of incense to the kindling of the Menorah, it also concluded that just as {{at the time of}} the Menorah lighting there was a burning of incense, similarly, {{at the time of the}} cleaning of the Menorah there was also a burning of incense.|$|R

Soon other wineries, such as Boushey Vineyard in the Yakima Valley, were receiving cuttings from Red Willow to plant in their vineyard.

25|$|Tornado-like eddies {{spinning}} off <b>from</b> <b>even</b> small storms {{can result}} in severe damage in small areas. Generally, summertime tornadoes are brief, are at the EF0 or EF1 level, and may not actually touch down. During the dry season, they can attain a force of EF2 and touch the ground for miles. While tornadoes in the Midwest are more severe, {{a higher rate of}} deaths are experienced in Florida, and Brevard County, specifically, due to higher population density and quantity of manufactured homes.|$|E
25|$|The Sakya school {{originated}} in the 11th century. It rose to power in the 13th century. Gorampa Sonam Senge (1429-1489), an important philosopher in the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism, established an understandings of Prasangika which differs from Tsongkhapa. According to Gorampa, emptiness is not just mere emptiness, the absence of inherent existence, but profound emptiness, {{the absence of the}} four extremes in phenomena. In Gorampa's approach, ultimate truth is a liberating insight, that is free <b>from</b> <b>even</b> grasping the mind.|$|E

25|$|This active {{butterfly}} {{is usually}} {{seen at the}} tops of trees and amidst foliage. It has a habit of landing and turning around almost immediately after alighting. It repeats this turning movements as it moves along branches. This is believed to help in evading predators by causing confusion about head orientation. This distinctive mode of movement gives the impression of dancing and is an important field characteristic that helps in identifying the species <b>from</b> <b>even</b> a distance.|$|E
25|$|Because {{cardiac output}} {{is related to}} the {{quantity}} of blood delivered to various parts of the body, it can be used as an important indicator of how efficiently the heart can meet the body's demands for perfusion. For instance, exercise requires a higher level of CO to support increased muscle activity. In heart failure, CO may be insufficient to even support simple activities of daily living and cannot increase sufficiently to match the higher metabolic demands stemming <b>from</b> <b>even</b> moderate exercise.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{having failed}} to secure a presidential {{nomination}} <b>from</b> <b>even</b> minor national parties in three different elections over a dozen years, Holdridge would always claim to have been nominated by the Vegetarians and the Prohibitionists, an achievement of such ephemeral value that no reporter ever questioned it.

Instead, he devoted his efforts to nascent movements designed to empower American Indians, and to anti-Catholic propaganda against the 1960 presidential campaign of John F. Kennedy.|$|E
