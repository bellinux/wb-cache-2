40|$|Studies {{regarding}} {{the effectiveness of}} thermally sprayed zinc as galvanic and/or as <b>impressed</b> <b>current</b> <b>anode</b> showed good results under favourable conditions such as high zinc/steel area ratio and sufficient direct moistening. Cathodic protection with sprayed zinc on chloride containing concrete is achieved at least 2 years. With unfavourable zinc/steel area ratio and with temporarily inadequate moistening after one year a marked decline in the protective effect (galvanic anode) was observed. Subsequent operation with external current required steadily increasing voltage due to the increase of the internal resistance of the zinc/concrete interface.

40|$|Corrosion {{of steel}} {{reinforcement}} in concrete bridges and parking garages {{due to the}} intrusion of chloride ions from deicing salt {{is a serious problem}} in northern climates. A number of approaches have been used in the past to mitigate steel corrosion. Cathodic protection is considered to be the only technique to slow down corrosion in salt contaminated concrete to a negligible rate. This is accomplished by either an <b>impressed</b> <b>current</b> <b>anode</b> or a sacrificial anode in the system. The <b>impressed</b> <b>current</b> <b>anode</b> system, with metallized zinc as the anode material, has been used with success on a number of bridges. The sacrificial anode system has been used on a limited number of bridges under marine environment. An impressed current system is difficult to apply to parking garages because of the thickness of concrete cover in these structures. Cover in concrete parking garages is typically much thinner than that used in bridges, and may easily cause electrical shorts between the anode and the reinforcing bar. Systems with sacrifical anodes, commonly referred to as galvanic cathodic protection systems, instead, take advantage of the reduced thickness of concrete cover, thus becoming a feasible form of protection for parking structures. The goal of this research project is to develop a sacrificial anode for cathodic protection of steel reinforcement in parking garages and bridges. Although {{it is too early to}} draw conclusions, certain trends have been reported on performance of sacrificial anode systems. So far the results indicate that the effectiveness of galvanic cathodic protection increases with decreasing the thickness of concrete cover. Salt contamination and moisture also increase the effectiveness of galvanic cathodic protection of reinforcement...|$|E

40|$|The {{applicability}} of cathodic protection to mitigate corrosion of carbon steel {{in two different}} environments containing H{sub 2 }S has been investigated using <b>impressed</b> <b>current</b> and sacrificial <b>anode</b> techniques. Results of <b>impressed</b> <b>current</b> tests conducted under potential control shows that the weight loss can be reduced significantly by shifting {{the potential of the}} metal 60 to 80 mV cathodic to the open circuit potential. The relationship between the applied current and the potential shift shows that the current requirement does not necessarily increase with the voltage shift, thus implying that the cost of cathodic protection may not increase in proportion to the protection achieved.

40|$|Carbonation induced {{corrosion}} is a {{major cause}} of decay of reinforced concrete structures. Electrochemical realkalisation treatment is described as an interesting technique to rehabilitate such structures. In this paper, the results of tests on both efficiency and durability of two realkalisation treatments (<b>impressed</b> <b>current</b> and galvanic <b>anodes),</b> in accordance with the CEN/TS 14038 - 1 specification (threshold current density of 200 A. h/mÂ²) are presented. The efficiency of both treatments is demonstrated qualitatively with acid/base indicators such as phenolphthalein and thymolphthalein and quantitatively by pH determinations. Non destructive electrochemical characterizations such as rest potential, linear polarization resistance and corrosion currents indicate a slight decrease of the corrosion activity after treatment although the passive state of the reinforcement encountered in uncarbonated concrete is not recovered. These results are confirmed by micro-Raman spectroscopy. Concerning the cement matrix, none evolution is detected by SEM, but alkaline content evaluation shows a noticeable enrichment in potassium (<b>impressed</b> <b>current)</b> or sodium ions (galvanic anodes) in the concrete cover...|$|R
40|$|This report {{investigated}} the main aspects of corrosion {{in the marine}} environment, from cause through to methods of prevention. This involved large amounts of reading and reviewing existing literature, which is abundant in such a well-established and researched field. Three primary themes of corrosion are presented; the mechanisms of how it occurs, the types of corrosion and the methods of prevention. This report demonstrates the electrochemistry of corrosion as well as various scenarios that can cause corrosion. Corrosion prevention provides a key area for this report and was therefore subcategorised into the following sections: marine coatings, <b>impressed</b> <b>current</b> and sacrificial <b>anodes.</b> These three themes were then explored in detail, looking into their applications, processes {{and some of the}} standards associated with their use in industry.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. This work reviews {{developments}} {{in the understanding of}} chloride induced corrosion of steel in concrete from both a kinetic and thermodynamic perspective. Corrosion damage is at least in part attributed to the production of acid at sites of corrosion initiation. Solid phase inhibitors provide a reservoir of hydroxyl ions to inhibit damage. Pit re-alkalisation is identified as an important protective effect in electrochemical treatments used to arrest corrosion. A process like pit re-alkalisation is achieved more easily by <b>impressing</b> <b>current</b> off sacrificial <b>anodes</b> using a power supply and may then be followed by low maintenance galvanic protection to prevent local acidification. Methods of monitoring the steel corrosion rate in electrochemically treated concrete have been developed and used to assess corrosion risk. Some of these concepts have been adopted in the recent international standard on cathodic protection, ISO 12696 : 2012. This work also considers some of the amendments to this standard...|$|R
40|$|Cathodic {{protection}} {{has been}} proven {{to be one of}} the most widely applicable and cost-effective solutions for tackling steel corrosion in reinforced concrete. In this study, the possible use of carbon fibre composites, which are primarily used to strengthen concrete members, has been investigated as <b>impressed</b> <b>current</b> cathodic protection <b>anodes.</b> Carbon fibre anodes have been assessed in both concrete and calcium hydroxide solution. Two bonding mediums incorporating epoxy and geopolymer have also been investigated. The results demonstrate that epoxy resin can be used for bonding carbon fibre fabric anodes to reinforced concrete structures while geopolymer is more effective for bonding carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) rod into preformed grooves in the concrete surface. The dissolution of carbon fibre anode appears to stablise after a period of time, dependent upon the size and shape of the anode and applied voltage and current. Based on the present results, a maximum current density of 128 [*]mA/m 2 of reinforcing steel area is recommended for the operation of CFRP fabric anode and 64 [*]mA/m 2 of reinforcing steel area for that of CFRP rod anode...|$|R

This is a rapidly growing field with many new innovations appearing in the market. The sacrificial anode technologies currently available are generally less powerful than <b>impressed</b> <b>current</b> cathodic protection but they are much less complex to apply.
