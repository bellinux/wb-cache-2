5|$|But in {{addition}} to being militarily exhausted, the Commonwealth was now pressured by several European diplomacies to suspend further military activities, to allow Gustavus Adolphus to <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> the Holy Roman Empire. The Truce of Altmark left Livonia north of the Daugava and all Prussian and Livonian seaports except for Danzig, Puck, Königsberg, and Libau in hands of the Swedes, who were also allowed to charge duty on trade through Danzig.|$|E

In 1979, the US {{negotiated}} {{access to an}} airport and port in both Mogadishu and Berbera; because of limited access the US had to locations in the Persian Gulf area, maintaining this access was a main interest for the Mogadishu embassy to pursue as the US mobilized to <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> Kuwait.|$|E
5|$|In {{the absence}} of {{intervention}} in the foreign exchange market by national government authorities, the exchange rate of a country's currency is determined, in general, by market forces {{of supply and demand}} at a point in time.

5|$|Roosevelt did {{not wish}} to lead the U.S. into the war; his 1937 Quarantine Speech denouncing {{aggression}} by Italy and Japan had met mixed responses. Welles felt freer in this regard, looking towards postwar border issues and the establishment of a U.S.-led international body that could <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> such disputes. Roosevelt saw Welles's stronger public statements as experiments that would test the public mood in regard to U.S. foreign policy.|$|E
5|$|The {{presidency}} of Taraki, albeit short-lived, was always marked by controversies. Taraki launched a land reform on 1 January 1979 which {{proved to be}} highly unpopular and, along with his government's other reforms, led to a popular backlash which initiated the Afghan civil war. Despite repeated attempts throughout his reign, Taraki proved unable to persuade the Soviet Union to <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> support of the restoration of civil order.|$|E

5|$|The {{struggle}} between Basiliscus and Zeno impeded the Eastern Roman Empire's ability to <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> {{the fall of}} the Western Roman Empire, which happened in early September 476. When the chieftain of the Heruli, Odoacer, deposed Western Emperor Romulus Augustus, sending the imperial regalia to Constantinople, Zeno had just regained his throne, and he could only appoint Odoacer dux of Italy, thereby ending the Western Roman Empire.|$|E
5|$|After Tod dies in a freak freak accident, {{they go to}} {{the morgue}} to see his body and find {{mortician}} William Bludworth. Bludworth explains to them Death's design and that they're still in danger. Realizing this, they attempt to rescue the remaining survivors. Following Terry's and Ms. Lewton's deaths, they are successful in saving Carter's life. Unfortunately, only seconds later Billy dies, causing them to realize that if they <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> someone's death they can save them. Believing himself to be next, Alex withdraws from the group.|$|E
5|$|After its creation, SEATO {{quickly became}} {{insignificant}} militarily, {{as most of}} its member nations contributed very little to the alliance. While SEATO military forces held joint military training, they were never employed because of internal disagreements. SEATO was unable to <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> conflicts in Laos because France and the United Kingdom rejected use of military action. As a result, the U.S. provided unilateral support for Laos after 1962. Though sought by the U.S., involvement of SEATO in the Vietnam War was denied {{because of lack of}} British and French cooperation.|$|E

5|$|After the Ottomans {{defeated}} {{the armies of}} the Holy League {{in a series of}} battles in 1596, Transylvanian noblemen sent letters to Andrew, offering him the principality. After realizing that neither the pope nor the Polish king would support him against Sigismund Báthory, Andrew declared that he was ready to make peace with him. He returned to Warmia where he was ordained subdeacon on 4 January 1597. Andrew and Stephen even announced that they would not <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> Transylvania. Their envoys also started discussions with Sigismund Báthory about the compensation for their expropriated Transylvanian estates.|$|E
5|$|Although Louis {{signed an}} {{alliance}} with the Republic of Genoa in October 1352, he did not <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> the Genoese–Venetian War, because his truce of 1349 with Venice was still in force. Louis married Elizabeth of Bosnia, who {{was the daughter of}} his vassal, Stephen II, in 1353. Historian Gyula Kristó says that this marriage showed Louis's renewed interest in the affairs of the Balkan Peninsula. While he was hunting in Zólyom County (now in Slovakia) in late November 1353, a brown bear attacked him, inflicting 24 wounds on his legs. Louis's life was saved by a knight of the court, John Besenyő, who killed the beast with his sword.|$|E
5|$|Antiochus III {{launched}} a massive campaign to retake Parthia and Bactria in 210 or 209BC. He was unsuccessful, but did negotiate a peace settlement with Arsaces II. The latter was granted {{the title of}} king (Greek: basileus) in return for his submission to Antiochus III as his superior. The Seleucids were unable to further <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> Parthian affairs following increasing encroachment by the Roman Republic and the Seleucid defeat at Magnesia in 190BC. Phriapatius of Parthia (r. c.191–176BC) succeeded Arsaces II, and Phraates I of Parthia (r. c.176–171BC) eventually ascended the throne. Phraates I ruled Parthia without further Seleucid interference.|$|E

5|$|As we {{understand}} the situation here, the Australian Constitution firmly places the prerogative powers of the Crown {{in the hands of}} the Governor-General as the representative of the Queen of Australia. The only person competent to commission an Australian Prime Minister is the Governor-General, and The Queen has no part in the decisions which the Governor-General must take in accordance with the Constitution. Her Majesty, as Queen of Australia, is watching events in Canberra with close interest and attention, but it would not be proper for her to <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> person in matters which are so clearly placed within the jurisdiction of the Governor-General by the Constitution Act.|$|E
5|$|During these events, no gunshots were fired. The {{people did}} not react strongly, which {{according}} to the military, {{was a sign of}} approval. A provisional government was formed, and the presidency was offered to Aubame. The government was composed of civilian politicians from both the UDSG and BDG, such as Paul Gondjout. As for the coup plotters, they were content to ensure security for civilians. The small Gabonese army did not <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> the coup; composed mostly of French officers, they remained in their barracks.|$|E

In addition, the security advantage of a buffer zone was recognised as irrelevant and the Soviets officially declared that they would no longer <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> the affairs of allied states in Central and Eastern Europe.|$|E
