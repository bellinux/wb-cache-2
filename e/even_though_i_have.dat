My vocal cords were {{and still are}} in excellent condition, but my 'sound boxes' have not been working well <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been to all the doctors. The result was that I overstrained my voice, and that caused it to wobble. (Gente, October 1, 1977) ...|$|E

I hope that <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> failed, Major Thomson may persuade you to change your mind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{father was}} a soldier, and fought bravely. I have heard him and his comrades conversing; I have seen them draw plans for a campaign, and discuss the {{strength}} of fortifications, until it seemed to me, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> had no experience in such matters, that I knew much concerning them." ...|$|E
5000|$|In July and August 1964, however, he {{unexpectedly}} {{entered a}} new kind of dimension. In his own words, [...] "the truth of the Gospel, that until then was unknown to me, became very clear and tangible. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never attended Church, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never studied religion, I found that my perspective as a secularist and agnostic had become suddenly Christian. What's more, Catholic." ...|$|R
50|$|Now, I {{must tell}} you that <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> hoped to be around a bit longer, death doesn’t worry me at all.|$|R
60|$|It {{was useless}} {{for me to}} argue against his purpose, {{whatever}} that might be, for the fellow was determined, and <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> gone {{down on my knees}} to him he would have done that which he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have been}} so kind to me," [...] she said, [...] "that I have almost come to look upon you as a mother, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> known you such a little while, and I {{want to tell you}} what I have been talking about, and what I think I am going to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lady Janet! Lady Janet! Don't {{leave me}} without a word. Oh, madam, try to feel {{for me a}} little! I am {{returning}} {{to a life of}} humiliation--the shadow of my old disgrace is falling on me once more. We shall never meet again. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not deserved it, let my repentance plead with you! Say you forgive me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|He laughed forcedly {{and pressed}} her hand. 'There are more reasons why I cannot tear myself away,' he added. 'What would become of my uncle's farming? Six hundred acres in this parish, and five hundred in the next--a {{constant}} traipsing from one farm to the other; he can't be in two places at once. Still, that might be got over {{if it were not}} for the other matters. Besides, dear, I still should be a little uneasy, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> your promise, lest somebody should snap you up away from me.' ...|$|E
3000|$|... “For this PGCE I paid around ten, eleven grand, so £ 11, 000, {{which is}} {{a huge amount of}} money and I didn't get any bursary as well, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a first class {{graduation}} things and whatever.” (Interview # 26) [...]...|$|R
30|$|Most of the pre-service {{teachers}} regarded science as including mainly observation and/or experimentation, and they underestimated {{the significance of}} modeling in scientific work <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> discussed modeling during the lessons. Only one group out of ten used modeling in their first LP.|$|R
60|$|And when I {{told him}} that the next {{afternoon}} I must leave him; he looked downhearted enough. But I cheered him as well as <b>I</b> could; <b>though</b> needing a little cheering myself; <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> got home again. But no more about that.|$|R
6000|$|... "Always have I {{been taught}} differently," [...] replied Ghek; [...] "but since I have known {{this woman and}} you, of another race, I {{have come to believe}} that there may be other {{standards}} fully as high and desirable as those of the kaldanes. At least I have had a glimpse of the thing you call happiness and I realize that it may be good <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no means of expressing it. I cannot laugh nor smile, and yet within me is a sense of contentment when this woman sings--a sense that seems to open before me wondrous vistas of beauty and unguessed pleasure that far transcend the cold joys of a perfectly functioning brain. I would that I had been born of thy race." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] she answered, [...] "the {{little yellow}} {{man who is}} named Light-in-Darkness put that thought into your heart, I think. Oh, do not trouble as to how I know it, who have many spies here, as he guessed well enough. So {{a woman who has}} lived two {{thousand}} years must be hideous and wrinkled, must she? The stamp of youth and loveliness must long have fled from her; of that you, the wise man, are sure. Very well. Now you tempt me to do what I had determined I would not do and you shall pluck the fruit of that tree of curiosity which grows so fast within you. Look, Allan, and say whether I am old and hideous, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> lived two thousand years upon the earth and mayhap many more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I had {{had little}} or nothing to say to her, for her father was a good deal of a swell and I was only a marine; but now she saw me {{standing}} there by myself, and she came right up to me. 'Can you tell me, sir,' she said, 'if anything else has happened? They are making a great din in the engine-room. I have been looking out of our port, and the vessel {{seems to me to be}} stationary.' She stopped at that, and waited to hear what I had to say, but I assure you I would have liked to have had her go on talking for half an hour. Her voice was rich and sweet, like that of so many Englishwomen, although, I am happy to say, a great many of my countrywomen have just as good voices; and when I meet any of them for the first time, I generally give them the credit of talking in soft and musical notes, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not had the pleasure of hearing them speak." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{will take}} him there nevertheless," [...] Pierre said in a tone so decided that <b>I</b> could not <b>have</b> contradicted him <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> made ready a good {{argument}} for so doing, and without delay the little lad from New Orleans set about acting on his own suggestion.|$|R
60|$|What could <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{said after}} such a remark, which savored more of {{irritation}} than I am able to make appear by words? <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> had proof that Seth Jepson {{was not the kind}} of a lad we should take on as comrade, that which Archie said would have silenced me.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, no,' said Barnet; 'I am {{not at all}} prepared; but I thought I {{would look}} in upon you for a moment, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not {{time to go home}} and dress. I'll stand back and see you pass out, and observe the effect of the {{spectacle}} upon myself as one of the public.' ...|$|R
6000|$|She got no further, however, {{for those}} last words wrought a {{marvelous}} change in Mac. Dropping her hands, he stood erect, as if inspired with sudden energy and hope, while {{over his face}} there came a brave, bright look, which for the moment made him a nobler and comelier man than ever handsome Prince had been. [...] "It is a comfort!" [...] he said, {{in a tone of}} gratitude that touched her very much. [...] "You said your love must be founded on respect, and that you have given me why can I not earn the rest? I'm nothing now, but everything is possible when one loves with all his heart and soul and strength. Rose, I will be your hero if a mortal man can, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to work and wait for years. I'll make you love me, and be glad to do it. Don't be frightened. I've not lost my wits I've just found them. I don't ask anything I'll never speak of my hope, but it is no use to stop me. I must try it, and I will succeed!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. MORLEY: In {{the same}} speech the hon. Gentleman {{made a great}} charge against our system of {{education}} in India--that we had not educated them at all; therefore, he excludes at once an enormous part of the population. The Imperial Duma, as I understood from my hon. friend was {{to be subject to}} the veto of the Viceroy. That is not democracy. We are to send out from Great Britain once in five years a Viceroy, who is to be confronted by an Imperial Duma, just as the Tsar is confronted by the Duma in Russia. Surely that is not a very ripe idea of democracy. My hon. friend visited the State of Baroda, and thought it well governed. Well, there is no Duma of his sort there. I will state frankly my own opinion <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not spent one single week-end in India. If I had to frame a new system of government for India, I declare I would multiply the Baroda system of government, rather than have an Imperial Duma and universal suffrage. The speech of my hon. friend, with whom I am sorry to find myself, not in collision but in difference, illustrates what is to my mind one of the grossest of all the fallacies in practical politics--namely, that you can cut out, frame, and shape one system of government for communities with absolutely different sets of social, religious, and economic conditions--that you can cut them all out by a sort of standardised pattern, and say that what is good for us here, the point of view, the line of argument, the method of solution--that all these things are to be applied right off to a community like India. I must tell my hon. friend that I regard that as a most fatal and mischievous fallacy, and I need not say more. I am bound, after what I have said, to add that I do not think that it is at all involved in Liberalism. I have had the great good fortune and honour and privilege to have known some of the great Liberals of my time, and there was not one of those great men, Gambetta, Bright, Gladstone, Mazzini, who would have accepted for one single moment the doctrine on which my hon. friend really bases his visionary proposition for a Duma. Is there any rational man who holds that, if you can lay down political principles and maxims of government that apply equally to Scotland or to England, or to Ireland, or to France, or to Spain, therefore they must be just as true for the Punjab and the United Provinces and Bengal? ...|$|E

6000|$|I {{received}} your book[35] {{with the}} greatest pleasure, and heartily thank you for it. It is a volume of a highly prepossessing appearance, and a most friendly look. I felt as if <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> taken to it at sight; even (a very large <b>even)</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> known nothing of its contents, or of its author! ...|$|R
40|$|I {{remember}} {{very clearly}} than <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> worked {{for ten years}} with cancer patients, when I called them up (family) and told them <b>I</b> <b>had</b> cancer, {{the first time the}} word came out of my mouth, it didn’t. I said, “The diagnosis is c- ” and I couldn’t say it. It was something that just couldn’t be applying to me...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Ebenezer. It was {{put there}} by Master Lillie's townsmen, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{no right to}} interfere, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the inclination, which I haven't. A man who gives his word of his own free will should hold to it or take the consequences. As I said before, Master Lillie's opinions, outside of {{business}} affairs, are not my opinions." ...|$|R
50|$|Translation: As for the remainder, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{described}} for France {{a greater number}} of species than Müller and Schroeter made known for the whole of Europe, and three times as many as Geoffroy and Poiret observed around Paris, still I am convinced that there remain many more discoveries of this kind to be made.|$|E
5000|$|I {{have now}} {{received}} refusals from every publisher. For {{me this is}} totally incomprehensible. Things {{have come to a}} pretty poor state when our publishers are so cautious, and think only of their wretched balance sheets, when a project of this importance concerning our greatest composer is proposed. I hope, however, you won't be angry with me, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> troubled you so much over this project.|$|E
5000|$|Stephen Yablo's (1998) {{response}} is to provide an error theory {{to account for the}} intuition that zombies are possible. Notions of what counts as physical and as physically possible change over time so conceptual analysis is not reliable here. Yablo says he is [...] "braced for the information that is going to make zombies inconceivable, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no real idea what form the information is going to take." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{not seen}} him when he rose from his knees, {{steaming}} with perspiration, glance at Brother Hawkyard, and <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not heard Brother Hawkyard's tone of congratulating him on the vigour with which he <b>had</b> roared, <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> detected a malicious application in this prayer. Unformed suspicions to a similar effect had sometimes passed through my mind in my earlier school-days, and had always caused me great distress; for they were worldly in their nature, and wide, very wide, of the spirit that had drawn me from Sylvia. They were sordid suspicions, without a shadow of proof. They were worthy to have originated in the unwholesome cellar. They were not only without proof, but against proof; for was I not myself a living proof of what Brother Hawkyard had done? and without him, how should <b>I</b> ever <b>have</b> seen the sky look sorrowfully down upon that wretched boy at Hoghton Towers? ...|$|R
6000|$|He smiled {{upon her}} very kindly. [...] "I think you said your {{instinct}} guided you. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not done the thing imputed to me, your instinct knew me for evil; and your instinct was right, for evil I am--I must be. These are your own words. But {{do not think}} that I mock you with them. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> come to recognize their truth." ...|$|R
60|$|That which {{rendered}} {{my situation}} critical {{was the fact}} of my being virtually unarmed. It will be remembered that the rifle was strapped to my back, and <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been unhampered, it would have required no slight time in which to unsling it. My knife was quite as useless, because, borne to the earth as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been, {{it could not be}} removed from my belt.|$|R
5000|$|Each {{painting}} {{portrays a}} moment of interaction or isolation on the boardwalk. Bryden describes them, “They’re moments of tranquility, {{waiting for something to}} happen.” They tell a story. “Each of one these is a stand-alone story, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no idea what the story is.” He captures people’s interactions, “I wanted them to react to each other. He goes after the tension that is built when they “recognize that the other person exists.” ...|$|E

5000|$|On December 30, 2016, Austin Carlile {{posted on}} his Instagram and Twitter {{an open letter}} stating that he's leaving the band to focus on healing, moving on, and getting better after {{settling}} in Costa Rica, saying [...] "...with the closing of one door, another will open."

60|$|It was {{possible}} to see out of the tail of my eye, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not heard his footsteps, that Abel Hunt was following {{less than half a}} dozen paces behind us, and a great fear came into my heart, for now I knew he was convinced we had had some hand in the disappearance of Horry Sims, and would act as our shadow in the hope of coming at the secret of the Tory's whereabouts.|$|R
