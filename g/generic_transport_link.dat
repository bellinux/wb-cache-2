40|$|This paper {{presents}} a modified numerical continuation approach for predicting the bifurcation behaviour of aeroelastic systems undergoing aperiodic limit cycles oscillations. Such oscillations can occur {{due to a}} number of nonlinear functions. Here, backlash nonlinearity in the aileron stiffness for a <b>Generic</b> <b>Transport</b> Aircraft is considered. It is shown that classical numerical continuation will fail due to the aperiodic nature of the limit cycles and the inability to perform period scaling and phase fixing. An alternative, approximate numerical continuation method is proposed, based on longer numerical integration sequences and a heuristic method for determining the period of the limit cycle oscillations. The approach is applied successfully to a simulated aeroelastic model of the <b>Generic</b> <b>Transport</b> Aircraft with backlash...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} {{the issue of}} designing a <b>generic</b> <b>transport</b> layer protocol for energy-constrained sensor networks. We present the requirements for such a transport protocol and propose Sensor Transmission Control Protocol (STCP). STCP is a generic, scalable and reliable transport layer protocol where {{a majority of the}} functionalities are implemented at the base station. STCP offers controlled variable reliability, congestion detection and avoidance, and supports multiple applications in the same network. We present the design and implementation of STCP and evaluate the protocol with different scenarios and network characteristics. I.
