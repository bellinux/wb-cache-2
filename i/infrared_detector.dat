5|$|Being a soft metal, mercury forms {{very stable}} {{derivatives}} with the heavier chalcogens. Preeminent is mercury(II) sulfide, HgS, which occurs in nature as the ore cinnabar {{and is the}} brilliant pigment vermillion. Like ZnS, HgS crystallizes in two forms, the reddish cubic form and the black zinc blende form. Mercury(II) selenide (HgSe) and mercury(II) telluride (HgTe) are also known, these as well as various derivatives, e.g. mercury cadmium telluride and mercury zinc telluride being semiconductors useful as <b>infrared</b> <b>detector</b> materials.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic ash {{clouds are}} very {{difficult}} to detect from aircraft as no onboard cockpit instruments exist to detect them. However, a new system called Airborne Volcanic Object <b>Infrared</b> <b>Detector</b> (AVOID) has recently been developed by Nicarnica Aviation, a daughter company of the Norwegian Institute for Air Research, which will allow pilots to detect ash plumes up to 100 km (62 mi) ahead and fly safely around them. The system uses two fast-sampling infrared cameras, mounted on a forward-facing surface, that are tuned to detect volcanic ash. This system can detect ash concentrations of <1 mg/m3 to > 50 mg/m3, giving pilots approximately 7–10 minutes warning. The camera is currently being tested by easyJet airline company.|$|E

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, HgCdTe (MCT)-based <b>infrared</b> <b>detectors</b> are popularly used as {{high-quality}} night-vision devices for MIR detection [14]. The MCT <b>infrared</b> <b>detectors</b> are made mainly from photoconductors, photodiodes, and avalanche photodiodes [14] in which electrodes {{are required to}} be made. Because the conventional ITO materials have relatively poor light transmittance in the MIR bandwidth, metal electrodes are often used for making MCT <b>infrared</b> <b>detectors</b> [14]. Normally, the metal electrodes cover about 20 - 30 % area in the active regime of the MCT chips (see, e.g., Figs. 13 to 15 in [14]). If the metal electrodes in the MCT <b>infrared</b> <b>detectors</b> are replaced by the transparent ones, then the radiation area becomes enlarged and, hence, {{we are able to}} enhance the efficiency of the MIR detection and {{to improve the quality of}} the infrared images. In this study, we demonstrate that graphene is a good candidate for transparent electrodes to be applied for the production of MCT <b>infrared</b> <b>detectors.</b>|$|R

The system was designated SCR-268, with SCR meaning either Set Complete Radio or Signal Corps Radio used interchangeably in documents. The SCR-268 was primarily intended for aiming searchlights associated with anti-aircraft guns; the system allowed coarse pointing of a thermal <b>infrared</b> <b>detector,</b> and this then aimed the searchlight. The night demonstration was for the Coast Artillery Board and was conducted at Fort Monroe, just off the coast near Hampton, Virginia.|$|E

The higher operating temperature for the <b>infrared</b> photon <b>detector</b> could be achieved by suppressing the thermally generated noise. Non-equilibrium mode of operation is an approach to achieve HOT <b>infrared</b> <b>detectors.</b> In this paper, we demonstrate two important milestones that are critical {{for the development of}} HOT <b>infrared</b> <b>detectors.</b> First, the growth of high quality (minority carrier lifetime of 7. 2 µsec at 200 K) heterostructures based on mercury cadmium telluride by molecular beam epitaxy for equilibrium and non-equilibrium types of detectors.

2500|$|The term {{infrared}} microscopy {{refers to}} microscopy performed at infrared wavelengths. In the typical instrument configuration a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) {{is combined with}} an optical microscope and an <b>infrared</b> <b>detector.</b> [...] The <b>infrared</b> <b>detector</b> can be a single point detector, a linear array or a 2D focal plane array. [...] The FTIR provides the ability to perform chemical analysis via infrared spectroscopy and the microscope and point or array detector enable this chemical analysis to be spatially resolved, i.e. performed at {{different regions of the}} sample. As such, the technique is also called infrared microspectroscopy [...] (an alternative architecture involves the combination of a tuneable infrared light source and single point detector on a flying objective). This technique is frequently used for infrared chemical imaging, where the image contrast is determined by the response of individual sample regions to particular IR wavelengths selected by the user, usually specific IR absorption bands and associated molecular resonances [...] A key limitation of conventional infrared microspectroscopy is that the spatial resolution is diffraction-limited. [...] Specifically the spatial resolution is limited to a figure related to the wavelength of the light. [...] For practical IR microscopes, the spatial resolution is limited to 1-3X the wavelength, depending on the specific technique and instrument used. [...] For mid-IR wavelengths, this sets a practical spatial resolution limit of ~3-30 μm.|$|E

2500|$|A Honeywell ring laser {{gyroscope}} {{was used for}} spin rate determination and to obtain an inertial timing reference before the MHV separated from the second stage.

The sensor utilized a strip detector where four strips of Indium Bismuth were arranged in a cross and four strips were arranged as logarithmic spirals. As the detector was spun, the infrared target's position could be measured as it crossed the strips in the sensor's field of view. The MHV <b>infrared</b> <b>detector</b> was cooled by liquid helium from a dewar installed {{in place of the}} F-15's gun ammunition drum and from a smaller dewar located in the second stage of the ASM-135. Cryogenic lines from the second stage were retracted prior to the spin up of the MHV.|$|E
