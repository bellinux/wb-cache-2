5|$|Patton was {{a staunch}} fatalist, and {{believed}} in reincarnation. He believed that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a military leader {{killed in action}} in Napoleon's army in a previous life, or a Roman legionary.|$|E
5|$|Had Napoleon {{succeeded in}} {{destroying}} the existing coalition forces south of Brussels {{before they were}} reinforced, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> able to drive the British back to the sea and knock the Prussians out of the war. Crucially, this would have bought him time to recruit and train more men before turning his armies against the Austrians and Russians.|$|E
5|$|It is also unknown {{under which}} Hellenized name the ancient {{historian}} Manetho listed Khaba. <b>He</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{the same person}} as the listed Mesôchris or Sôÿphis, but this in turn is doubted by Wolfgang Helck and Eberhard Otto. They connect both names with king Sanakht.|$|E
60|$|We {{laughed at}} this, for by our {{reckoning}} <b>he</b> <b>might</b> almost <b>have</b> <b>been</b> our father.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>might</b> also <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{with more}} certainties {{the father of}} another Caecilius Metellus, the father of Quintus Caecilius Metellus.|$|R
50|$|Augustine of Hippo {{does not}} name the thief, but wonders if <b>he</b> <b>might</b> not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> baptized at some point.|$|R
5|$|Fossett {{took off}} with enough fuel for four to five hours of flight, {{according}} to spokesperson Major Cynthia S. Ryan, Public Information Officer with the Civil Air Patrol (CAP). Searchers with CAP were told that Fossett had gone out for a short flight over favorite territory, possibly including the areas of Lucky Boy Pass and Walker Lake. At one point {{it was suggested that}} <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> out scouting for potential sites to conduct a planned land speed run.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} version, as {{recorded by}} the Japanese Imperial Army, indicated that he was executed and then hung upside down from a cherry tree due to his 2 days of stubborn retaliation and for not surrendering. (Other accounts say that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> tied to the tree first, then repeatedly bayoneted to death.) British accounts have confirmed that his corpse was found hung upside down after the surrender {{and this has been}} repeated in a number of authoritative texts on the Malayan campaign.|$|E
5|$|There are extant liturgical vestments {{containing}} embroidered figures, {{including that}} of St. Barbara, in Lochner's style and with similar facial types. This has led to some speculation whether Lochner provided the models. In addition a number of contemporary stained glass panels are similar in style, {{and there has been}} debate whether <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> responsible for church murals; the over-life size figures of the Dombild and Virgin with the Violet indicate his ability to work on a monumental scale.|$|E
60|$|He was dumb for a time, {{astonished}} beyond measure, as <b>he</b> well <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been.</b> <b>He</b> doubted his ears. He was outraged.|$|R
60|$|It crossed Pigling's {{mind that}} if HE {{had asked for}} a lift, too, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> still <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in time for market.|$|R
60|$|There was {{no change}} in her face, but Swithin's pale eyes bulged as though <b>he</b> <b>might</b> {{suddenly}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> afflicted with insight.|$|R
5|$|Were he to {{have died}} prior to AD23, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> hailed as an {{exemplary}} ruler. Despite the overwhelmingly negative characterization left by Roman historians, Tiberius left the imperial treasury with nearly 3 billion sesterces upon his death. Rather than embark on costly campaigns of conquest, he chose to strengthen the existing empire by building additional bases, using diplomacy as well as military threats, and generally refraining from getting drawn into petty squabbles between competing frontier tyrants.|$|E
5|$|Whalebone was foaled in 1807 out of {{the mare}} Penelope, who was a {{daughter}} of Prunella. He raced for six years and won the Derby in 1810. He later sired two Derby winners, Lap-dog and Spaniel and Caroline, winner of the Oaks. <b>He</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the sire of Derby winner Moses, but Moses' parentage is uncertain due to his dam being covered by two stallions.|$|E
5|$|Władysław {{used the}} title of the King of Sweden, {{although}} he had no control over Sweden whatsoever and never set foot in that country. However, he continued his attempts to regain the Swedish throne, with similar lack of results as his father. <b>He</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> willing to trade his claim away, but the offer was never put down in the negotiations.|$|E
60|$|Lancey {{admitted}} that <b>he</b> <b>might,</b> perhaps, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a little harsh in expressing himself, {{and then went}} off {{to prepare for the}} journey.|$|R
5000|$|And another verse states: Unless one is {{initiated}} by a bona-fide spiritual master in the disciplic succession, the mantra <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> received <b>is</b> without any effect.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh no, indeed, Mr. Poulter," [...] said Tom, delightedly {{handing him}} the crown-piece, and {{grasping}} the sword, which, <b>he</b> thought, <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> lighter with advantage.|$|R
5|$|Constantine XI died without {{producing}} an heir, and had Constantinople not fallen <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> succeeded by {{the sons of}} his deceased elder brother, who were taken into the palace service of Mehmed II {{after the fall of}} Constantinople. The oldest boy, re-christened as Has Murad, became a personal favorite of Mehmed and served as Beylerbey (Governor-General) of the Balkans. The younger son, renamed Mesih Pasha, became Admiral of the Ottoman fleet and Sancak Beg (Governor) of the Province of Gallipoli. He eventually served twice as Grand Vizier under Mehmed's son, Bayezid II.|$|E
5|$|He was {{commissioned}} second lieutenant in The Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own) {{at the start}} of the First World War and departed for the Western Front a few weeks later. In February 1915, he was attached to the Royal Flying Corps and soon became No. 2 Squadron's senior observer. In August 1915, while on a photographic reconnaissance mission, his aircraft was shot down in northern France, near Lille. At the time of his death, it was suggested that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the first undergraduate to see action in the war.|$|E
5|$|There is {{uncertainty}} about Davies's date of birth. Most records say November 1886, though usually with the caveat that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> born several years earlier. His birthplace was 39 John Street, Abercwmboi (then known as Cap Coch) in the South Wales coalfields, the fourth child of Thomas Davies {{and his wife}} Esther. Thomas was a miner and trade union activist, who under the pseudonym Y Llwynog ("the Fox") wrote a column for the Welsh language newspaper Tarian y Gweithiwr ("The Worker's Shield"), in which he berated pit management and safety practices. His general militancy led to his blacklisting by pit owners, and after spells of unemployment he eventually found work as an insurance agent.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>might</b> well <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{doubtful}} of her humor. He {{seemed to}} decide that she was jesting, for he answered lightly, [...] "Why, you began it." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{spoke with}} bitterness, for the {{disappointment}} was very great, and physical weakness had rendered him {{less able to}} bear it than <b>he</b> <b>might</b> otherwise <b>have</b> <b>been.</b>|$|R
60|$|The Man of Fancy now discerned another guest, {{who stood}} so {{quietly in the}} shadow of one of the pillars that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> easily <b>have</b> <b>been</b> overlooked.|$|R
5|$|While other spies such as Julius and Ethel Rosenberg and Klaus Fuchs {{were caught}} after the war, Koval {{apparently}} went unscrutinized for years. Among the reasons given for his maintained cover was that inter-service politics undermined efforts to perform proper security checks on employees. Another {{possibility is that}} the U.S. government chose scientific ability over clear records and political sympathies. In the 1950s, the FBI investigated his wartime activities and interviewed his former colleagues, leaving them {{with the impression that}} <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a spy. The matter was kept confidential for sixty years as the US was afraid of the damage that would result from the exposure of Koval's activities.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{was neither}} aesthetically nor {{technically}} {{among the best}} batsmen, Leyland {{had a reputation for}} batting well under pressure. He performed most effectively against the best teams and bowlers, and in difficult situations; his Test batting record is better than his first-class figures, and against Australia his average is even higher. Outside of Tests, he had some success with the ball, and {{had it not been for}} the depth of spin bowling in Yorkshire, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a leading bowler. He was one of the first to bowl left-arm wrist-spin, and may have invented the name to describe such deliveries—"chinamen". Very popular with team-mates and spectators, Leyland had a reputation as a humorist, and many stories were told about him.|$|E
5|$|In the East, Diocletian {{engaged in}} {{diplomacy}} with desert tribes {{in the regions}} between Rome and Persia. <b>He</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> attempting to persuade them to ally themselves with Rome, thus reviving the old, Rome-friendly, Palmyrene sphere of influence, or simply attempting to reduce the frequency of their incursions. No details survive for these events. Some of the princes of these states were Persian client kings, a disturbing fact in light of increasing tensions with the Sassanids. In the West, Maximian lost the fleet built in 288 and 289, probably {{in the early spring}} of 290. The panegyrist who refers to the loss suggests that its cause was a storm, but this might simply have been an attempt to conceal an embarrassing military defeat. Diocletian broke off his tour of the Eastern provinces soon thereafter. He returned with haste to the West, reaching Emesa by 10 May 290, and Sirmium on the Danube by 1 July 290.|$|E
25|$|Kobayashi's {{psychiatrist}} diagnosed him as {{suffering from}} antisocial personality disorder and pedophilia, but sane {{enough to be}} responsible for his actions, believing <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> even <b>been</b> gnawed by a sense of guilt.|$|R
50|$|Between 1546 and 1547, Belle was a magister duodenorum at the Collégiale Sainte-Croix in Liège. <b>He</b> <b>might</b> also <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a zangmeester at the Church of Our Lady at Sint-Truiden.|$|R
50|$|He was {{appointed}} director of football for Tipperary in January 2010, but GAA rules meant <b>he</b> <b>might</b> not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{able to hold}} this role while also being county manager.|$|R
5|$|Æthelric was a monk at Christ Church Priory at Canterbury {{prior to}} his {{becoming}} a bishop. Several historians opine that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{the same as the}} Æthelric who was a monk of Canterbury and a relative of Godwin, Earl of Wessex. That Æthelric was elected by the monks of Canterbury to be Archbishop of Canterbury in 1050, but was not confirmed by King Edward the Confessor who insisted on Robert of Jumièges becoming archbishop instead. The evidence is not merely that they shared the same name, because the name was a relatively common one in Anglo-Saxon England. Other evidence pointing to the possibility of them being the same person includes {{the fact that he was}} felt to have been unfairly deposed in 1070 as well as the bishop's great age in 1076.|$|E
5|$|After trying {{that for}} a while and with no land in sight, Taylor decided that it was {{impossible}} for them to fly so far west and not reach Florida. He believed that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> near the Key West Islands. What followed was a series of serious confusions between Taylor, his team and the control tower. Taylor was not sure whether he was near Bahama or Key West, and he was not sure which direction was which due to compass malfunction. The control tower informed Taylor that he could not be in Key West since the wind that day did not blow that way. Some of his teammates believed that their compass was working. Taylor then set a course northeast according to their compass, which should take them to Florida if they were in Key West. When that failed, Taylor set a course west according to their compass, which should take them to Florida if they were in Bahama. If Taylor stayed this course he would have reached land before running out of fuel. However, at some point Taylor decided that he had tried going west enough. He then once again set a course northeast, thinking they were near Key West after all. Finally, his flight ran out of fuel and may have crashed into the ocean somewhere north of Abaco Island and east of Florida.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, at the {{direction}} of the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence, Senator David Feeney, the Defence Honours and Awards Appeals Tribunal opened an inquiry into thirteen cases of unresolved recognition for past acts of gallantry. Among the group were eleven naval personnel, including Sheean. Known as the 'Valour Inquiry', the Tribunal was directed to determine if the individuals were unduly overlooked for recognition {{at the time of their}} actions and, if so, whether retrospective awards were appropriate. The inquiry lasted two years and witnessed 166 written submissions from the public, before the Tribunal reported its findings in January 2013. In the case of Sheean, the Tribunal found that there was no manifest injustice with the award of the Mention in Despatches, and that there was no new evidence to support the reconsideration of Sheean for a Victoria Cross for Australia. If Sheean had lived, they reported, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> recommended for either the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal or the Distinguished Service Medal instead, but neither medal could be awarded posthumously in 1942. The Tribunal did recommend that the RAN perpetuate the use of Sheean as the name of a major combatant vessel.|$|E
6000|$|Anne, amused {{in spite}} of herself, was rather distressed for an answer, and the Admiral, fearing <b>he</b> <b>might</b> not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> civil enough, took up the subject again, to say-- ...|$|R
60|$|Master Hymn-of-Praise Busy was vastly perturbed. Try how <b>he</b> <b>might,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{unable to}} make any {{discovery}} {{with regard to the}} mysterious events, which he felt sure were occurring all round him, a discovery which--had he but made it--would have enabled him to apply with more chance of success, for one of the posts in my Lord Protector's secret service, and moreover, would have covered his name with glory.|$|R
6000|$|... "As a philosopher, his labours and his discoveries are {{calculated}} {{to advance the}} interests of humanity: <b>he</b> <b>might,</b> indeed, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> justly termed the friend of man, the benefactor of the universe! ...|$|R
