40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel distributed {{video surveillance system}} (<b>E-touch)</b> on Overlay Network. <b>E-touch</b> is constructed {{by a set of}} overlay nodes that can provide intelligence media service. The system allows service composition of distributed stream processing applications dynamically, to satisfy their end-to-end QoS demands. Compare to traditional centralized-group management scheme, our approach achieves better scalability and resource utilization by efficiently allocating media service resources. Large-scale experimental results demonstrate the scalability, efficiency and performance of the <b>E-touch</b> system.

40|$|Abstract. Most haptic APIs cannot {{efficiently}} render complex scenes. This paper presents {{two techniques}} that {{can reduce the}} time needed to haptically render a complex scene: a technique based on a spatial grid and a technique based on a modification of an octtree. These techniques are both theoretically and experimentally compared with each other and the default algorithm used in <b>e-Touch.</b> These results are discussed in order to draw conclusions on the best technique for a given scene. ...|$|E
