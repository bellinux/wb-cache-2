25|$|In the 1970s, complex {{modelling}} {{revolved around}} manually identifying {{features on the}} surfaces of the <b>interactors,</b> and interpreting the consequences for binding, function and activity; any computer programmes were typically used {{at the end of}} the modelling process, to discriminate between the relatively few configurations which remained after all the heuristic constraints had been imposed. The first use of computers was in a study on hemoglobin interaction in sickle-cell fibres. This was followed in 1978 by work on the trypsin-BPTI complex. Computers discriminated between good and bad models using a scoring function which rewarded large interface area, and pairs of molecules in contact but not occupying the same space. The computer used a simplified representation of the interacting proteins, with one interaction centre for each residue. Favorable electrostatic interactions, including hydrogen bonds, were identified by hand.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally DNA microarrays use {{complementary}} DNA or oligonucleotide probes {{to analyze}} messenger RNA (mRNA) from genes of interest. Extracted total RNA {{serves as a}} template for complementary DNA (cDNA) that is tagged with fluorescent probes before being allowed to hybridize to the microarray for visualization. For proteases, specific probes for protease genes and their inhibitors {{have been developed to}} view expression patterns on the mRNA transcript level. The two platforms currently available for this purpose come from corporate and academic sources. Affymetrix’s Hu/Mu ProtIn Microarray uses 516 and 456 probe sets to evaluate human and murine proteases, inhibitors, and <b>interactors</b> respectively. CLIP-CHIP™, developed by the Overall Lab, is a complete protease and inhibitor DNA microarray for all 1561 human and murine proteases, non-proteolytic homologues, and their inhibitors. Both of these tools allow comparison of expression patterns between normal and diseased samples and tissues. Unfortunately, as transcript levels often fail to reflect protein expression levels, gene microarrays are limited in representing protein in samples. In addition, proteases recruited from remote sources like nearby tissues are ignored by these DNA based arrays, reiterating the need for protein based methods to confirm the presence and activity of functional enzymes when transcriptome analysis is performed.|$|E

2500|$|The term [...] "docking" [...] {{originated}} in the late 1970s, with a more restricted meaning; then, [...] "docking" [...] meant refining {{a model of a}} complex structure by optimizing the separation between the <b>interactors</b> but keeping their relative orientations fixed. [...] Later, the relative orientations of the interacting partners in the modelling was allowed to vary, but the internal geometry of each of the partners was held fixed. This type of modelling is sometimes referred to as [...] "rigid docking".

Indirect <b>interactors</b> (dials, switches, buttons, sliders) enable the user to control various aspects of her visualization. <b>Interactors</b> are smarter because they are data-driven. <b>Interactors</b> are auto-ranging and self-limiting.

40|$|Key Words [...] Adaptive control; <b>interactor</b> matrix; linear systems; robustness; vector {{relative}} degree. Akaraet [...] The {{notion of}} <b>interactor</b> matrix or equivalently the Hermite normal form, is a generalization of relative degree to multivariable systems, and {{is crucial in}} problems such as decoupling, inverse dynamics, and adaptive control. In order for a system to be input-output decoupled using static state feedback, {{the existence of a}} diagonal <b>interactor</b> matrix must first be established. For a multivariable linear system which does not have a diagonal <b>interactor</b> matrix, dynamic precompensation or dynamic state feedback is required for achieving a diagonal <b>interactor</b> matrix for the compensated system. Such precompensation ften depends on the parameters of system, and is thus difficult to implement with accuracy when the system is subject to parameter uncertainty. In this paper we characterize a class of linear systems which can be precompensated to achieve a diagonal <b>interactor</b> matrix without the exact knowledge of the system parameters. More precisely, we present necessary and sufficient conditions on the transfer matrix of the system under which there exists a diagonal dynamic precompensator such that the compensated system has a diagonal <b>interactor</b> matrix. These conditions are associated with the so-called (non) generic singularity of certain matrix related to the system structure but independent of the system parameters. The result of this paper is expected to be useful in robust and adaptive designs. 1...|$|R
50|$|In 1994 Aura Systems {{launched}} the <b>Interactor</b> Vest, conceived by Aura's VP of Audio and Video Technologies, Larry Shultz to feel sound from {{video games and}} TV shows. The <b>Interactor</b> was a wearable force-feedback device that monitors an audio signal and uses Aura's patented electromagnetic actuator technology to convert bass sound waves into vibrations that can represent such actions as a punch or kick. The <b>Interactor</b> vest plugs into the audio output of a stereo, TV, or VCR and the user is provided with controls that allow for adjusting of the intensity of vibration and filtering out of high frequency sounds. The <b>Interactor</b> Vest is worn over the upper torso and the audio signal is reproduced through a speaker embedded in the vest. Sales numbers are unclear, but have numbers as low as 5000 of its <b>Interactor</b> Vest sold in Toys R Us and other electronics stores. Aura later began shipping the <b>Interactor</b> Cushion, a device which operates like the Vest but instead of being worn, it's placed against a seat back and the user must lean against it. Both the Vest and the Cushion were launched with a price tag of $99.|$|R

A simple state-space design of the <b>interactor</b> is proposed by using these properties. Then, some new features about state-space relations among the original system, the <b>interactor,</b> and the compensated system are presented. Also, several conditions about the invariance of the stabilizability or controllability between the state-space realizations of the original system and the compensated system are shown.
