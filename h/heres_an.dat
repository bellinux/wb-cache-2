60|$|About {{two o'clock}} in the day the great smoking-room is crowded with countless little groups. They sit about small round tables, or in circles of chairs, and the haze of tobacco seems to prolong the great narrow place, with its pillars and bays, to infinity. Some of the groups are big, as many as a dozen men talk in loud tones; some are duologues, and there is always a {{sprinkling}} of lonely, dissociated men. At first one gets an impression of men going from group to group and as it were linking them, but as one watches closely one finds that these men just visit three or four groups at the outside, and know nothing of the others. One begins to perceive more and more distinctly that one is dealing with a sort of human mosaic; that each patch in that great place is of a different quality and colour from the next and never to be mixed with it. Most clubs have a common link, a lowest common denominator in the Club Bore, who spares no one, but even the National Liberal bores are specialised and sectional. As one looks round one sees <b>here</b> <b>a</b> clump of men from the North Country or the Potteries, <b>here</b> <b>an</b> island of South London politicians, <b>here</b> <b>a</b> couple of young Jews ascendant from Whitechapel, <b>here</b> <b>a</b> circle of journalists and writers, <b>here</b> <b>a</b> group of Irish politicians, here two East Indians, <b>here</b> <b>a</b> priest or so, <b>here</b> <b>a</b> clump of old-fashioned Protestants, <b>here</b> <b>a</b> little knot of eminent Rationalists indulging in a blasphemous story SOTTO VOCE.
