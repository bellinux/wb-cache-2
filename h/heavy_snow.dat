5|$|October 9, 1804 — <b>Heavy</b> <b>snow</b> {{falls in}} Eastern New York peaking at 30 inches (75 cm) as a {{hurricane}} tracks northward along the East Coast and becomes extratropical, as cold air {{fed into the}} system.|$|E
5|$|Railroads employ snow sheds—structures {{that cover}} the track—to prevent the {{accumulation}} of <b>heavy</b> <b>snow</b> or avalanches to cover tracks in snowy mountainous areas, such as the Alps and the Rocky Mountains.|$|E
5|$|Most {{end users}} of {{forecasts}} {{are members of}} the general public. Thunderstorms can create strong winds and dangerous lightning strikes that can lead to deaths, power outages, and widespread hail damage. <b>Heavy</b> <b>snow</b> or rain can bring transportation and commerce to a stand-still, as well as cause flooding in low-lying areas. Excessive heat or cold waves can sicken or kill those with inadequate utilities, and droughts can impact water usage and destroy vegetation.|$|E

5000|$|Plains Blizzard of late 1885. In Kansas, <b>heavy</b> <b>snows</b> of late 1885 had piled drifts {{ten feet}} high.|$|R
50|$|<b>Heavy</b> <b>snows</b> also {{fell across}} the northwestern {{quadrant}} of the storm. <b>Heavy</b> <b>snows</b> fell {{in parts of}} Nebraska and Colorado on the 13th and 14th, with more eastern areas such as Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, Maine, Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick being on the 15th and 16th. Montreal and Sherbrooke received just over 8 inches (20 cm) of snow. Portions of Maine received as much as 10 inches of snow (25 cm).|$|R
5|$|No {{ski poles}} are used, and no {{assistance}} from others (such as being pushed from the gate) is allowed. In <b>heavy</b> <b>snow</b> conditions the tracks can become clogged up, which reduces inrun speed and may cause an unpredictable descent for athletes. Event personnel {{standing by the}} sides of the inrun are often assigned to use leaf blowers to prevent the tracks from clogging up with snow.|$|E
5|$|On 1 December 2010, {{the bridge}} was closed {{for the first time}} due to <b>heavy</b> <b>snow.</b> After several {{accidents}} meant snowploughs were unable to clear the carriageways, {{the bridge was}} closed in both directions at 6.40a.m. and remained closed for several hours. As part of celebrations of the fiftieth anniversary of the bridge's operation, artist Kate Downie was commissioned to create a print of the bridge and hold an exhibition of works portraying it.|$|E
5|$|Alpine spaniels {{were kept}} by the canons of the monasteries in the Alps in order to search for {{travellers}} during <b>heavy</b> <b>snow</b> storms, including the Great St. Bernard Hospice in the Great St Bernard Pass between Italy and Switzerland. The dogs would be dispatched in pairs to search for fallen travellers, and were trained so that upon finding them {{would return to the}} canons in order to lead rescuers back to the unfortunate individuals. The Alpine breed was also used as a watchdog to guard sheep and cattle of mountainous regions, including the Himalayas.|$|E
50|$|Before {{the modern}} road was built, the pass, apparently, {{used to be}} open only {{three months of the}} year because of <b>heavy</b> <b>snows.</b>|$|R
25|$|The <b>heaviest</b> <b>snow</b> in Maryland {{fell from}} the {{northern}} suburbs of Washington, D.C., to the Baltimore area. These areas overwhelmingly saw over a foot of snow. Snowfall rates of 2–3inches (5–8cm) per hour were common, and thundersnow occurred. Snowfall amounts of up to 21inches (53cm) were reported in Columbia, 13.1inches (33.3cm) in Baltimore, 17inches (43cm) in Catonsville, and a foot (30.5cm) in Potomac. This was the area's <b>heaviest</b> <b>snow</b> since the North American blizzard of 2003. Lesser amounts occurred in western and southern parts of the state.|$|R
50|$|A dam moderating {{the flow}} from the spring was {{destroyed}} by a flood in early 2006 following <b>heavy</b> <b>snows</b> the previous winter, damaging the nearby village of Tattiwin.|$|R
5|$|An area of low {{pressure}} moved generally eastward from Oklahoma and produced heavy rains from Missouri to Ohio on February 8. By February 9, it had reached Kentucky. A new, secondary {{low pressure}} system formed over Georgia along the warm front {{associated with the}} primary low. As the secondary low matured along the U.S. East Coast, the initial center weakened rapidly, and heavy rainfall developed over the Carolinas in association with the new low. Mixed precipitation soon spread across the Mid-Atlantic States, and <b>heavy</b> <b>snow</b> began to fall from New Jersey northward by 1200 UTC on February 9.|$|E
5|$|Director Harry Morris {{identified}} {{a site for}} a new ground in Bordesley Green, some three-quarters of a mile(1km) from Muntz Street towards the city centre. The site was where a brickworks once operated; the land sloped steeply down to stagnant pools, yet the stadium was constructed in under twelve months from land clearance to opening ceremony on Boxing Day 1906. <b>Heavy</b> <b>snow</b> nearly prevented the opening; volunteers had to clear pitch and terraces before the match, a goalless draw against Middlesbrough, could go ahead. The ground is reputed to have been cursed by gypsies evicted from the site; although gypsies {{are known to have}} camped nearby, there is no contemporary evidence for their eviction by the club.|$|E
5|$|Exactly 33 years later, on December 8, 2005, Southwest Airlines Flight 1248, a Boeing 737-700 inbound from Baltimore-Washington International Airport in Baltimore, Maryland, {{slid off}} the runway while {{attempting}} to land {{at the airport in}} a <b>heavy</b> <b>snow</b> storm. The airplane broke through the barrier fence of the airport, and came to rest at the intersection of 55th Street and Central Avenue bordering the airport at its northwest corner. A 6-year-old boy was killed as a passenger in a vehicle that was struck by the plane after it skidded into the street.|$|E
50|$|The <b>heaviest</b> <b>snow</b> in Maryland {{fell from}} the {{northern}} suburbs of Washington, D.C., to the Baltimore area. These areas overwhelmingly saw over a foot of snow. Snowfall rates of 2-3 inches (5-8 cm) per hour were common, and thundersnow occurred. Snowfall amounts of up to 21 inches (53 cm) were reported in Columbia, 13.1 inches (33.3 cm) in Baltimore, 17 inches (43 cm) in Catonsville, and a foot (30.5 cm) in Potomac. This was the area's <b>heaviest</b> <b>snow</b> since the North American blizzard of 2003. Lesser amounts occurred in western and southern parts of the state.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, the Colorado Air National Guard, {{assisted}} by the Wyoming Air National Guard dropped thousands of bales of hay in Colorado ranges to prevent cattle heads trapped by <b>heavy</b> <b>snows</b> from starving.|$|R
50|$|Mogami {{is located}} in the {{mountains}} of extreme north eastern Yamagata Prefecture. Despite its name, the Mogami River does not run through the town. The area is known for extremely <b>heavy</b> <b>snows</b> in winter.|$|R
5|$|On {{the central}} front, the ROK III Corps defended the 38th {{parallel}} north of Gapyeong (Kapyong) and Chuncheon. Composed of the ROK 2nd, 5th, 7th and 8th Infantry Divisions, the ROK III Corps placed the ROK 2nd Infantry Division on the corps' left flank {{in the hills}} north of Gapyeong, while the ROK 5th Infantry Division defended the corps' center at Chuncheon. The winter conditions created great difficulties for the South Korean defenders, with the <b>heavy</b> <b>snow</b> hindering construction and icy roads limiting food and ammunition resupply. North Korean guerrillas were also active in the region, and caused serious disruption {{in the rear of}} the ROK III Corps.|$|E
5|$|Although his {{contingent}} did {{not reach}} {{in time for the}} fighting, the city's capital was taken. Aside from some farm life, the town had been largely abandoned. The taking of the region marked a continuous swath of territory held by Armenians stretching from Karabakh to Armenia proper, a total of 3,000 square kilometers. In the retreat through the Omar Pass of the Murov mountain range, many Azeri refugees froze to death. With the last helicopters leaving on April 1, they were forced to walk through the <b>heavy</b> <b>snow</b> at freezing temperatures. Nearly 39,000 civilians were processed into the camps at Yevlakh and Dashkesen with as many as 15,000 unaccounted for. Four Azerbaijani MI-8 helicopters ferrying refugees and wounded out of the conflict zone crashed, the last of which was hit by Armenian forces. Human Rights Watch findings concluded that during the Kalbajar offensive Armenian forces committed numerous violations of the rules of war, including forcible exodus of civilian population, indiscriminate fire and hostage-taking.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the battle the ROK III Corps was located to the east of the US 24th Infantry Division of the US IX Corps, defending the 38th parallel to the north of Gapyeong (Kapyong) and Chuncheon. Composed of four divisions, the ROK III Corps placed its ROK 2nd Infantry Division on the corps' left flank at the hills north of Gapyeong, while the ROK 5th Infantry Division defended the corps' center at Chuncheon. The cold winter created great difficulties for the South Korean defenders, with the <b>heavy</b> <b>snow</b> hindering construction and icy roads limiting food and ammunition supplies. North Korean guerrillas were also active in the region, and had caused serious disruption {{in the rear of the}} ROK III Corps.|$|E
50|$|In winter, {{the park}} is notable for its yukitsuri — ropes {{attached}} in a conical array to carefully support tree branches in the desired arrangements, thereby protecting the trees from damage caused by <b>heavy</b> <b>snows.</b>|$|R
50|$|Packwood Lake {{has been}} used for several {{thousand}} years by Native Americans as summer quarters and hunting territory. Due to extremely cold winters and subsequent <b>heavy</b> <b>snows,</b> the area is considered largely uninhabitable during the winter.|$|R
25|$|The {{winter of}} 2006–2007 {{was marked by}} heavy poaching. Poaching of tigers and their wild prey species is {{considered}} to be driving the decline, although <b>heavy</b> <b>snows</b> in the winter of 2009 could have biased the data.|$|R
5|$|In the Middle-Atlantic states, {{it caused}} little injury overall, though many boats and ships were capsized. To {{the north in}} New England, many churches endured {{significant}} damage, and shipwrecks led to 15deaths, with one other death owing to a building collapse. Due to intense gusts, hundreds of trees were uprooted and many buildings were unroofed. Agriculture, shipping, timber, and livestock industries also suffered substantial impairment, with considerable injury experienced by barns, crops, watercraft, timber, and livestock. Farther north, entire swaths of forest were leveled, and <b>heavy</b> <b>snow</b> blocked roads, paths, and turnpikes. Fruit orchards and sugar groves endured {{the worst of the}} storm, reducing the season's harvests. Private properties generally suffered damage to roofs, windows, and chimneys; several buildings throughout the region were reported to have collapsed. Overall, approximately $100,000 in damage and more than 16deaths were recorded.|$|E
5|$|Later in the war, Young's {{farmhouse}} and Four Corners {{were the}} site of the largest military engagement near the river. By 1780, the Continentals were operating much more freely around northern Westchester, although they had to stay on the move to avoid attack. In January, one company of about 250 troops from Massachusetts lingered long enough at Four Corners for local Loyalists to inform the British, who raised a force of about 100 cavalry and 400 to 500 infantry at Fort Washington, today on the northern tip of Manhattan. The force marched to Yonkers and up the Saw Mill overnight, arriving at Four Corners the next morning. The outnumbered Continentals put up stiff resistance, aided by the cold, <b>heavy</b> <b>snow</b> cover and their opponents' fatigue, but most were ultimately killed or taken prisoner. The British and their Loyalist and Hessian allies celebrated by burning down the Young house; the Continentals retreated {{to the north of the}} Croton River for the rest of the war.|$|E
5|$|On Thursday, December 12, 1799, Washington {{spent several}} hours {{inspecting}} his plantation on horseback, in snow, hail, and freezing rain; that evening, he ate his supper without changing from his wet clothes. He awoke {{the next morning}} with a severe sore throat and became increasingly hoarse as the day progressed, yet still rode out in the <b>heavy</b> <b>snow,</b> marking trees for cutting on the plantation. Some time around 3a.m. that Saturday, he suddenly awoke with severe difficulty breathing and almost completely unable to speak or swallow. He was {{a firm believer in}} bloodletting, which was a standard medical practice of that era, and he had used it to treat various ailments of slaves on his plantation. He ordered estate overseer Albin Rawlins to remove nearly a pint of his blood.|$|E
50|$|The Kancamagus Highway stays {{open all}} winter, {{although}} it occasionally closes {{for short periods}} while crews clear <b>heavy</b> <b>snows.</b> Its only major intersection, Bear Notch Road, which connects with the town of Bartlett, is closed all winter.|$|R

5000|$|In general, {{the city}} has a {{temperate}} climate and is classified as having an [...] "inland climate": {{a wide range of}} temperature bringing hot summers and cold winters, but <b>heavy</b> <b>snows</b> are rare, at most once a year.|$|R
5|$|The {{chairman}} of the Pageantry Committee was Walt Disney, {{who was responsible for}} producing both the opening and closing ceremonies. He organized an opening that included 5,000 entertainers, the release of 2,000 pigeons, and a military gun salute of eight shots, one for each of the previous Winter Olympic Games. The opening ceremonies were held on February 18, 1960, at Blyth Arena {{in the midst of a}} blizzard. The <b>heavy</b> <b>snow</b> fall caused traffic problems that delayed the ceremony by an hour. The festivities began with a sustained drum roll as the flags of each participating nation were raised on specially designed flag poles. Vice President Richard Nixon represented the United States government and declared the Games open. The Olympic cauldron was lit by Kenneth Henry, Olympic champion of the 500meter speed skating race at the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo. The Olympic oath was taken by Carol Heiss on behalf of all the athletes. As the national delegations left the stadium fireworks concluded the ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|The first {{services}} {{started on}} 1 July 1907 from Voss to Myrdal. An official opening train attempted to cross {{part of the}} line to Gulsvik on 9 December 1907, but got stuck in <b>heavy</b> <b>snow</b> and had to return. It {{turned out that the}} railway had to close and it took one and a half months to clear it for snow. Even a rotary snowplow at 750kW was not powerful enough {{to get rid of the}} snow. A new attempt to open the line in 1908 succeeded, and a train went from Gulsvik to Bergen. The line from Roa to Gulsvik was still under construction, so passage was along the Drammen Line via the Krøder Line with ship over Krøderen to Gulsvik. The first scheduled train from Oslo West Station en route to Bergen departed 10 June 1908.|$|E
5|$|Thirty-seven {{people were}} killed during the storm and its aftermath. Most of them were killed in motor vehicle accidents, {{including}} one in Ontario, three in Nebraska, two in New York, two in Illinois, two in New Jersey, two in Indiana, two in Delaware, one in New Brunswick, five in Quebec, one in Louisiana, one in New Hampshire, six in Vermont, one in Missouri, one in Pennsylvania, one in Virginia, and six in Ohio. In addition to traffic accidents, fatalities were reported due to tornadoes, heart attacks while shoveling, roof collapses due to <b>heavy</b> <b>snow,</b> falling tree branches and carbon monoxide poisoning. In Quebec City, a 16-year-old boy disappeared during the snowstorm and was found dead three days later in a snow bank.|$|E
