5|$|When {{the scale}} of the {{divergence}} between the IPK and national <b>kilogram</b> prototypes was reported in 2005, a debate arose on how best to redefine the <b>kilogram</b> – should the <b>kilogram</b> be defined in terms of the mass of the silicon-28 atom or should it be determined using the watt balance? The mass of a silicon atom could be determined using the Avogadro project and using Avogadro's number be linked directly to the <b>kilogram.</b>|$|E
5|$|Current definition: The <b>kilogram</b> is {{the unit}} of mass; it {{is equal to the}} mass of the {{international}} prototype of the <b>kilogram.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{definition}} of the <b>kilogram</b> is undergoing a fundamental change—the current definition defines the <b>kilogram</b> as being {{the mass of the}} international prototype <b>kilogram</b> which is an artefact, not a constant of nature while the new definition relates it to the equivalent energy of a photon via the Planck constant.|$|E
50|$|In 1984, {{the biomass of}} wild trout was 85.19 <b>kilograms</b> {{per hectare}}. This {{included}} 81.18 <b>kilograms</b> per hectare of brown trout and 4.01 <b>kilograms</b> per hectare of brook trout. By 1997, the wild trout biomass decreased to 50.85 <b>kilograms</b> per hectare. This included 39.66 <b>kilograms</b> per hectare of brown trout (including 5.72 <b>kilograms</b> per hectare of brown trout less than 175 millimeters long and 33.94 <b>kilograms</b> per hectare of brown trout that are more than 175 millimeters long) and 11.19 <b>kilograms</b> per hectare of brook trout (including 4.45 <b>kilograms</b> per hectare of brook trout that are less than 175 millimeters long and 6.74 <b>kilograms</b> per hectare of brook trout that are less than 175 millimeters long.|$|R
50|$|The C&ED and the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) are {{responsible}} for anti-drug law enforcement. Seizures of illicit drugs in 2003 included 52.87 <b>kilograms</b> of heroin, 562.15 <b>kilograms</b> of herbal cannabis, 24.46 <b>kilograms</b> of cannabis resin, 8.33 <b>kilograms</b> of cocaine, 41.1 <b>kilograms</b> and 1,272 tablets of methylamphetamine, 35.56 <b>kilograms</b> and 141,038 tablets of ecstasy-type tablets (MDMA, etc.), 51.3 <b>kilograms</b> and 238 tablets of ketamine, and substantial quantities of various narcotics, analgesics and tranquillisers.|$|R
50|$|Farm {{family members}} on average {{consumed}} {{much less of}} most major kinds of goods than urban residents. For instance, a household survey found in 1985 that the average urban dweller consumed 148 <b>kilograms</b> of vegetables, 20 <b>kilograms</b> of meat, 2.6 <b>kilograms</b> of sugar, and 8 <b>kilograms</b> of liquor. At the same time, a survey of rural households found that the average rural resident consumed 131 <b>kilograms</b> of vegetables, 11 <b>kilograms</b> of meat, 1.5 <b>kilograms</b> of sugar, and 4 <b>kilograms</b> of liquor. Differences of a similar nature existed for consumer durables.|$|R
5|$|The {{virtue of}} {{electronic}} realizations like the Kibble balance {{is that the}} definition and dissemination of the <b>kilogram</b> {{would no longer be}} dependent upon the stability of <b>kilogram</b> prototypes, which must be very carefully handled and stored. It would free physicists from the need to rely on assumptions about the stability of those prototypes. Instead, hand-tuned, close-approximation mass standards would simply be weighed and documented as being equal to one <b>kilogram</b> plus an offset value. With the Kibble balance, while the <b>kilogram</b> would be delineated in electrical and gravity terms, all of which are traceable to invariants of nature; it would be defined {{in a manner that is}} directly traceable to just three fundamental constants of nature. The Planck constant defines the <b>kilogram</b> in terms of the second and the metre. By fixing the Planck constant, the definition of the <b>kilogram</b> would depend only on the definitions of the second and the metre. The definition of the second depends on a single defined physical constant: the ground state hyperfine splitting frequency of the caesium 133 atom Δν(133Cs)hfs. The metre depends on the second and on an additional defined physical constant: the speed of light c. If the <b>kilogram</b> is redefined in this manner, mass artifacts—physical objects calibrated in a Kibble balance, including the IPK—would no longer be part of the definition, but would instead become transfer standards.|$|E
5|$|They {{concluded}} that one cubic decimetre {{of water at}} its maximum density was equal to 99.9265% of the target mass of the provisional <b>kilogram</b> standard made four years earlier. That same year, 1799, an all-platinum <b>kilogram</b> prototype was fabricated with the objective that it would equal, as close as was scientifically feasible for the day, the mass of one cubic decimetre of water at 4°C. The prototype {{was presented to the}} Archives of the Republic in June and on December 10, 1799, the prototype was formally ratified as the kilogramme des Archives (<b>Kilogram</b> of the Archives) and the <b>kilogram</b> was defined as being equal to its mass. This standard stood for the next 90 years.|$|E
5|$|A French-inspired {{initiative}} for international cooperation in metrology {{led to the}} signing in 1875 of the Metre Convention. Initially the convention only covered standards for the metre and the <b>kilogram.</b> A set of 30 prototypes of the metre and 40 prototypes of the <b>kilogram,</b> in each case made of a 90% platinum-10% iridium alloy, were manufactured by the British firm Johnson, Matthey & Co and accepted by the CGPM in 1889. One of each was selected at random to become the International prototype metre and International prototype <b>kilogram</b> that replaced the mètre des Archives and kilogramme des Archives respectively. Each member state was entitled to one {{of each of the}} remaining prototypes to serve as the national prototype for that country.|$|E
5000|$|After the war, most of {{the ashes}} dumped into bomb holes and ditches by the {{cremation}} commando were exhumed in 1947 and buried in Warsaw cemeteries. They included 5,578 <b>kilograms</b> of human remains from Stalina Avenue, 2,180 <b>kilograms</b> from the military prison at Zamenhofa, 1,029 <b>kilograms</b> from 60 Wolska Street, 1,120 <b>kilograms</b> from Sowinski Park, 600 <b>kilograms</b> from 47 Dzielna Street, 600 <b>kilograms</b> from the Franaszek Factory, 192 <b>kilograms</b> from 59 Okopowa Street, and 120 <b>kilograms</b> from [...] "Dobrolin" [...] Wolska Street, among several other locations. The full list of burial sites was then delivered to the Regional Commission for the Investigation of Nazi German Crimes in Poland.|$|R
50|$|Progress M-09M {{had been}} {{launched}} on a resupply {{mission to the}} ISS on 28 January 2011.

5|$|Abir {{collected}} 70 tons {{of dried}} rubber in 1895, rising to 410 tons in 1898 {{by which time}} it had eleven operational posts. At {{the same time the}} price of rubber also increased from 6.30–6.50 fr per <b>kilogram</b> in 1894 to 8.04–10.00 fr per <b>kilogram</b> in 1898. Abir's costs in 1897 amounted to 0.25 fr per <b>kilogram</b> to purchase the rubber from the collectors (in lieu of tax), 0.4 fr for transportation, 0.25 in export duty paid to the Congo Free State and 0.45 for storage for a total cost of 1.35 fr per <b>kilogram.</b> In the same year Abir could sell on the rubber in Europe for up to 10 fr per <b>kilogram.</b> Abir's profits rose with the increasing quantity and price of rubber, for the first two years (1892–94) the company recorded a total profit of 131,340 fr, this had increased almost twentyfold by 1898 when they recorded a 2,482,697 fr profit just for one year. As a result, the dividend paid in 1898 was 1,100 fr per 500 fr share. These profits were made in spite of increasing costs due the doubling of export duty in 1892 and the construction of the Leopoldville-Matadi railway in 1894 which increased the cost of moving rubber to the coast to 0.63 fr per kilo, more than the entire trip to Antwerp had taken in 1892.|$|E
5|$|After the metre was redefined in 1960, the <b>kilogram</b> {{remained}} the only SI base unit that {{relied on a}} specific physical artefact, the international prototype of the <b>kilogram</b> (IPK), for its definition and thus the only unit that was still subject to periodic comparisons of national standard kilograms with the IPK. After the 1996–1998 recalibration, a clear divergence between the various prototype kilograms was observed.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{definition}} of the <b>kilogram</b> remained unchanged throughout the twentieth century, the 3rd CGPM in 1901 clarified that the <b>kilogram</b> was a unit of mass, not of weight. The original batch of 40 prototypes (adopted in 1889) were supplemented from time to time with further prototypes for use by new signatories to the Metre Convention.|$|E
5000|$|Progress M-16M {{was packed}} with 1397 <b>kilograms</b> of equipment, food, clothing, life support system gear ("dry" [...] cargo), 680 <b>kilograms</b> of {{propellant}} to replenish reservoirs that feed the Russian maneuvering thrusters, 420 <b>kilograms</b> of water and 47 <b>kilograms</b> of oxygen and air.|$|R

5|$|An alloy of 90% {{platinum}} and 10% iridium {{was used}} in 1889 to construct the International Prototype Metre and <b>kilogram</b> mass, kept by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures near Paris. The meter bar was replaced as {{the definition of the}} fundamental unit of length in 1960 by a line in the atomic spectrum of krypton, but the <b>kilogram</b> prototype is still the international standard of mass.|$|E

5|$|Because SI prefixes {{may not be}} {{concatenated}} (serially linked) {{within the}} name or symbol for a unit of measure, SI prefixes are used with the gram, not the <b>kilogram,</b> which already has a prefix {{as part of its}} name. For instance, one-millionth of a <b>kilogram</b> is 1mg (one milligram), not 1µkg (one microkilogram).|$|E

5|$|Because of its rarity, it {{is among}} the most {{expensive}} elements. Price for pure scandium fluctuates between 4 000 and 20 000 US dollars per <b>kilogram.</b> Meanwhile, the limited market generates a variety of prices at any given time. In 2010, {{at the peak of the}} rare-earths shortage, the price of scandium rose to over 15,000 US dollars per <b>kilogram,</b> and the widely commercially used scandium oxide (Sc2O3) was selling above 7 000 US dollars per <b>kilogram.</b> Since then the limited demand coupled with steady production keeps the price at its 20-year average.|$|E
5|$|The International Prototype <b>Kilogram</b> was {{commissioned}} by the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) {{under the authority of}} the Metre Convention (1875), and in the custody of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) who hold it on behalf of the CGPM. After the International Prototype <b>Kilogram</b> had been found to vary in mass over time relative to its reproductions, the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) recommended in 2005 that the <b>kilogram</b> be redefined in terms of a fundamental constant of nature. At its 2011 meeting, the CGPM agreed in principle that the <b>kilogram</b> should be redefined in terms of the Planck constant. The decision was originally deferred until 2014; in 2014 it was deferred again until the next meeting. There are currently several different proposals for the redefinition (some of which have been abandoned); these are described in the Proposed Future Definitions section below.|$|E
5|$|The {{accuracy}} of the measured value of the Avogadro constant is currently limited by the uncertainty {{in the value of}} the Planck constant—a measure relating the energy of photons to their frequency. That relative standard uncertainty has been 50parts per billion (ppb) since 2006. By fixing the Avogadro constant, the practical effect of this proposal would be that the uncertainty in the mass of a 12C atom—and the magnitude of the kilogram—could be no better than the current 50ppb uncertainty in the Planck constant. Under this proposal, the magnitude of the <b>kilogram</b> would be subject to future refinement as improved measurements of the value of the Planck constant become available; electronic realizations of the <b>kilogram</b> would be recalibrated as required. Conversely, an electronic definition of the <b>kilogram</b> (see Electronic approaches, below), which would precisely fix the Planck constant, would continue to allow 83⅓ moles of 12C to have a mass of precisely one <b>kilogram</b> but the number of atoms comprising a mole (the Avogadro constant) would continue to be subject to future refinement.|$|E
30|$|Local {{production}} and imports (continental United States and foreign countries) of consumable food in Hawai‘i are estimated at just over 1.14 million tonnes in 2010.

50|$|There are two {{separate}} ecotypes, Mariñano {{or of the}} 'low areas', as well as Montaña, of the 'high areas'. The first ecotype generally features heavier sheep, at around 35-40 <b>kilograms</b> in females and 50-70 <b>kilograms</b> in males.

5|$|The current {{definitions}} of the <b>kilogram,</b> ampere, kelvin and mole be revised.|$|E
5|$|The {{long-term}} {{solution to this}} problem, however, is to liberate the SI system's dependency on the IPK by developing a practical realization of the <b>kilogram</b> that can be reproduced in different laboratories by following a written specification. The units of measure in such a practical realization would have their magnitudes precisely defined and {{expressed in terms of}} fundamental physical constants. While major portions of the SI system would still be based on the <b>kilogram,</b> the <b>kilogram</b> would in turn be based on invariant, universal constants of nature. Much work towards that end is ongoing, though no alternative has yet achieved the uncertainty of 20 parts per billion (~20µg) required to improve upon the IPK.|$|E
