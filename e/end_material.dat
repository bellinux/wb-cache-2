5000|$|The {{double seam}} is made using a double seamer, which can {{have just one}} or a number of heads or seaming stations. The double seam is formed by {{mechanically}} interlocking five layers of material together: three layers of the can end and two layers of the can body. Each seaming head typically consists of two rolls, a first operation roll and second operation roll, and a chuck. Some seaming machines have two first operation rolls and two second operation rolls and a few machines use a method called [...] "rail seaming" [...] which requires no rolls. During the seaming operation, the can end is lowered on to the filled can body and held down by the chuck, which acts as an anvil to the seaming operation. The first operation roll then engages the can end against the can body thereby folding the end curl around the flange of the body. In some seaming machines, this is done as the can is turning at high speed. In other seaming machines, the can is stationary and the first operation roll (or rolls) spins around several times to ensure a complete first operation. After the first operation is complete, the first operation roll disengages from the can and the second operation roll then engages the can. The purpose of the second operation is to iron out the double seam into its final shape and remove the voids between the layers of can and <b>end</b> <b>material.</b> In practice, ironing {{out all of the}} can and <b>end</b> <b>material</b> in a double seam without leaving some voids is impossible without the use of a sealing compound.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{monitoring}} of high <b>end</b> <b>material</b> removal processes continues to develop to {{greater levels of}} technical sophistication which in turn enable greater levels of insight into the process phenomena occurring at the tool-chip interface. The broaching process is a traditional machining process which is used extensively {{in the manufacture of}} some of the most expensive components of the aero engine. As a relatively slow cutting process with low degrees of freedom, broaching could be a target for strain based monitoring. It is well known that strain gauges provide a rich source of data when installed close to the cutting process. This research provides insight into the resistive strain gauge measurements during broaching. The paper also specifically focuses on the use of surface acoustic wave based strain measurement and provides some initial observations on the strain data available during tooth loading and cutting scenarios in broaching...|$|E

We construct a five orbital model by approximately unfolding the Brillouin zone of the three dimensional ten orbital model obtained from first principles calculation.

The incommensurate spin fluctuation observed experimentally is understood as originating from interband interactions, where the multiorbital nature of the band structure results in an electron-hole asymmetry of the incommensurability in the whole iron-based superconductor family. As for superconductivity, s-wave and d-wave pairings are found to be in close competition, where the sign change in the gap function in the former is driven by the incommensurate spin fluctuations.

40|$|There are {{two types}} of Insulated rail joints (IRJs) in the railway track: {{inserted}} and glued. The IRJs in the track are significant components in relation to integrity and safety of rail signalling operations. Because of low values of vertical bending rigidity of IRJs, cyclical dynamic wheel loading forces increase significantly at IRJs, thus accelerating material degradation and damage of their components such as rail ends, endposts, joint bars, etc. As a result, relatively free rail ends are created at IRJs that further amplify dynamic wheel load impacts. Only limited literature are available addressing the free end of rail effects at IRJs targeting stress distributions {{in the vicinity of the}} rail joints. To understand clearly the delamination process of inserted endpost IRJs and the damage of the endpost and rail <b>end</b> <b>material,</b> a thorough analysis targeting the modes of failure of both glued and inserted IRJs and subsequent damage of the railhead material is necessary to find ways to improve the joint’s life. In this paper, a 3 D finite element analysis (FEA) is carried out to assess damage when the endpost is either initially installed loosely (“inserted” rather than “glued”) in between the ends of the rail at the IRJ or becomes a loose fit due to plastic delamination of a glued joint, or when a gap is created between the rail and endpost due to pull-apart problems as the rails contract longitudinally in winter. Both 5 mm and 10 mm gaps (inserted endpost IRJs) are considered, using a peak vertical pressure load of 2500 MPa applied at one rail end. This peak load ensures a ratchetting failure mode of the rail <b>end</b> <b>material.</b> Plastic deformations and stress distributions in the vicinity of inserted IRJs are quantified using FEA data and compared with that of the glued IRJs (5 mm and 10 mm endpost thicknesses) to show the free end of rail effects. Residual stress and strain distributions indicate the damage of the railhead material. The progressive damage of the railhead material at the rail ends can be quantified by equivalent plastic strain (PEEQ). The free end of rail effects can be further illustrated by comparing PEEQ for inserted and glued IRJs. The railhead material of 5 mm and 10 mm inserted endpost IRJs is more sensitive to permanent deformation compared to that of the corresponding glued IRJs. Therefore, inserted IRJs pose an increased potential threat to rail operations in relation to damage of railhead and endpost materials and premature failure of IRJs...|$|E
40|$|The {{rational}} {{design of}} catalyst materials {{is of great}} industrial significance, {{yet there is a}} fundamental lack of knowledge {{in some of the most}} well-established processes, e. g. formation of supported nanoparticle structures through impregnation. Here, the choice of precursor has a significant influence on the resulting catalytic properties of the <b>end</b> <b>material,</b> yet the chemistry that governs the transformation from defined molecular systems to dispersed nanoparticles is often overlooked. A spectroscopic method for advanced in situ characterization is employed to capture the formation of PdO nanoparticles supported on γ-Al 2 O 3 from two alternative molecular precursors - Pd(NO 3) 2 and Pd(NH 3) 4 (OH) 2. Time-resolved diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy is able to identify the temperature assisted pathway for ligand decomposition, showing that NH 3 ligands are oxidized to N 2 O and NO– species, whereas NO 3 – ligands assist in joining Pd centers via bidentate bridging coordination. Combining with simultaneous X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, the resulting nucleation and growth mechanisms of the precious metal oxide nanoparticles are resolved. The bridging ability of palladium nitrate aids formation and growth of larger PdO nanoparticles at lower onset temperature (360 °C) for migration to form observable Pd–Pd distances of PdO nanoparticles. These smaller nanoparticles have improved dispersion and an increased number of step and edge sites compared to those formed from the conventional Pd(NO 3) 2 salt, favoring a lower light off temperature for complete methane oxidation...|$|E
40|$|Metal {{additive}} manufacturing techniques have been increasingly attracting {{the interest of}} the aerospace and biomedical industry. A particular focus has been on high value and complexity parts and components, as there the advantages offered by {{additive manufacturing}} are very significant for the design and production organisations. Various additive manufacturing techniques have been tested and utilized over the past years, with laser-based technology being among the preferred solutions – e. g. selective laser melting / sintering (SLM / SLS). Fatigue qualification, as one of the primary design challenges to meet, imposes the need for extensive material testing. Moreover, this need is amplified by the fact that currently there is very limited in-service experience and understanding of the distinct mechanical behaviour of additively manufactured metallic materials. To this <b>end,</b> <b>material</b> modelling can serve as a mediator, nevertheless research particular to additively manufactured metals is also quite limited. This work attempts to identify the cyclic elastoplastic behaviour characteristics of SLM manufactured Ti- 6 Al- 4 V. A set of uniaxial stress and strain controlled mechanical tests have been conducted on as-built SLM coupons. Phenomena critical for engineering applications and interrelated to fatigue performance (mean stress relaxation, ratcheting) have been examined under the prism of constitutive modeling. Cyclic plasticity models have been successfully employed to simulate the test results. Moreover, a preliminary analysis has been conducted on the differences observed in the elastoplastic behaviour of SLM and conventionally manufactured Ti- 6 Al- 4 V and their possible connection to material performance in the high cycle fatigue regime...|$|E
