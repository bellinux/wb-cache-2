25|$|Justinian then {{targeted}} {{his former}} place of exile in the Crimea. There his brother-in-law, the Khagan, had infringed on Imperial territory {{by establishing a}} Khazar governor of his own to run Cherson. Upon arriving there, the expedition set about <b>doing</b> <b>its</b> work— countless citizens were drowned (apparently with weights attached) and seven were roasted alive. The Tudun, the governor appointed by the Khagan was sent to Constantinople with 30 others. However, a storm destroyed his army and his fleet when he ordered it to return. Justinian {{is said to have}} greeted the news with great laughter. Another fleet was sent but the arrival of the Khagan's army made Justinian reconsider his move to a more diplomatic one. He decided to send the Tudun back to the Khagan with his apologies and had George of Syria to present the Imperial apology. The citizens of Cherson were naturally in no mood to hear any apology after what Justinian had done. When the Tudun died along the way, the Khazars took it upon themselves to send his 300-strong escort to the afterlife with him.|$|E
25|$|GM {{announced}} on May 18, 2017 {{that it would}} exit the Indian market, which it had entered {{for the second time}} in 1996. The first time was in 1928, when it became the first car maker to manufacture cars in India. GM would however continue to manufacture cars from its Talegaon, Maharashtra plant for the export market. This plant has a capacity of 1,60,000 units annually. The older Halol, Gujarat plant with a capacity for 50,000 units stopped production on April 28, 2017. It will be sold, with GM in talks with China's SAIC Motor Corporation Ltd. The India arm's domestic sales for April 2016 – March 2017 declined to 25,823 units from 32,540 the previous year and market share contracted from 1.17 percent to 0.85 percent for the same period. However, exports surged 89 percent during the same period to 70,969 units. GMTC-I, GM's technical center in Bengaluru, India will continue <b>doing</b> <b>its</b> global work. About 400 employees, 8 percent of GM's total Indian work-force, would be affected by the pull-out. Weak product line-up and below par service quality were the reasons for the poor showing by GM in India. It will also affect 10,000 employees working with about 120 Outlets/Dealership of GM in India.|$|E
25|$|Pope John Paul II Park Reservation: The Pope John Park Reservation is {{approximately}} 66 acres in size, {{and is also}} open year-round for the residents of Dorchester. In its earlier times it {{was used as a}} landfill and also a drive-in theatre. It also serves as a barricade between the Town of Dorchester, Boston and Neponset River waterfront. This park now gives residents various resources such as; Picnic facilities, soccer fields, play areas, paths for walking, and also spacious land to plant trees and shrubs. Unfortunately, it was not always like this. In May 2015, According to James W. Dolan, Pope John Paul Park Reservation was not the same as it used to be. The State Department of Conservation and Recreation, which is responsible for the park, is not really <b>doing</b> <b>its</b> job. The plants are either dead or overgrown. There are no gardens or trees that would catch anyone's eye and also no picnic tables or grills where families could gather around and do a cookout. Dolan states that he wants to see people of the community planting vegetables and tending flower beds in the park, paddling canoes in the river, and also a grove of trees so people could sit in the shade and look out at the river.|$|E

[...] Taylor stated that the province was <b>doing</b> <b>its</b> best to improve the road, but funds were being spread among other important highway projects in the province. [...] "Meanwhile, you must not forget you have a completely black topped road here, one that is equal to the best roads in some of the other provinces and the United States," [...] Taylor said. [...] Nevertheless, the Chamber was still concerned about the condition of the road, particularly in the Crowsnest Pass region where mountainous terrain and steep grades were making upgrades difficult. [...] There was also concern about the diversion of traffic from Highway3 to the Trans-Canada Highway, which would {{have a negative effect on}} the economies of southern Alberta municipalities.|$|E
500|$|The {{proposed}} nominations of Wodehouse for a knighthood in 1967 and 1971 {{were blocked}} {{for fear that}} such an award would [...] "revive the controversy of his wartime behaviour and give currency to a Bertie Wooster image of the British character which the embassy was <b>doing</b> <b>its</b> best to eradicate". When Wodehouse was awarded the knighthood, only four years later, the journalist Dennis Barker wrote in The Guardian that the writer was [...] "the solitary surviving English literary comic genius". After his death six weeks later, the journalist Michael Davie, writing in the same paper, observed that [...] "Many people regarded... as he regarded Beachcomber, as 'one, if not more than one, of England's greatest men'", while {{in the view of}} the obituarist for The Times Wodehouse [...] "was a comic genius recognized in his lifetime as a classic and an old master of farce".|$|E
500|$|In 2005, {{members of}} the mod {{community}} discovered that the PC version of [...] could be modified to unlock an incomplete sex minigame known as [...] "Hot Coffee", which Rockstar North had decided to leave out of the final game. The discovery of the minigame caused California State Assemblyman Leland Yee to rebuke both Rockstar and the ESRB, arguing that the ESRB was not <b>doing</b> <b>its</b> job properly. US Senators Hillary Clinton and Joe Lieberman also expressed their disapproval. Rockstar initially claimed that the minigame {{was created by the}} mod community and was {{not a part of the}} original game. This was disproven when it was discovered that a third-party cheat device could be used to unlock the [...] "Hot Coffee" [...] scenes in console versions of the game. Following an investigation, the ESRB changed its rating from M to AO, setting a precedent that games can be re-rated due to the presence of pertinent content that exists on the game's disc, even if that content is programmed to not be playable without modification or unauthorized use of a third-party cheat device. Following the release of a version excluding the content, the rating was reverted to M.|$|E

500|$|The Ministry of Supervision (MOS) was {{established}} by the State Council in 1987 to supervise in [...] "government departments, state organs and public officials, and maintaining administrative discipline." [...] Since its inception, the MOS' jurisdiction was unclear; most government personnel, as party officials, were under {{the purview of the}} CCDI. Before 1987, the CCDI was responsible for issuing administrative sanctions to public officials; since it enforced party discipline and the MOS enforced state law, in theory [...] "the two agencies operated in separate spheres". The reality was less clear-cut; most public servants were party members, and the MOS and CCDI customarily began separate investigations of the same person. In these dual investigations, the CDIs (and sometimes the CCDI) claimed primary jurisdiction over cases involving important party figures and tried to prevent the MOS from <b>doing</b> <b>its</b> work. To solve this problem, the MOS and the CCDI were effectively merged in 1993–1994; although their organisational identities remained separate, the internal offices of the MOS merged with the CCDI. Since then, the CCDI has conducted the work of the MOS; the Minister of Supervision customarily holds the concurrent post of Deputy Secretary of the CCDI, and the organisations share a website.|$|E
500|$|In June 2012, Dunderdale's {{government}} {{brought forth}} controversial legislation, known as Bill 29, that reformed the province's Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act. The {{amendments to the}} act expanded the government's ability to deny access to information by keeping ministerial briefings secret, ignoring requests for information that cabinet ministers deem to be [...] "frivolous," [...] and barring the auditor general from a wider array of records. Deadlines to respond to requests were pushed back, and fees were increased from $15 to $25. The opposition leaders immediately condemned the bill and said they would team up to filibuster the bill. An expert on international access-to-information laws, Toby Mendel, called key changes to the act “breathtaking,” and said the province will rank lower than some third world countries with the new legislation. As well 75 people also assembled outside the Confederation Building to protest the bill. However, Newfoundland and Labrador's information commissioner, Ed Ring, said bill 29 was {{not a bad thing}} and that it would not stop the Access to the Information and Protection of Privacy Act from <b>doing</b> <b>its</b> job. Bill 29 led to a four-day filibuster in the House of Assembly, which eventually ended when the government invoked closure to the debate. NDP leader Lorraine Michael's accusation that the government was being racist, when referring to Mendel's criticism of the bill, was cited by the government as reasons to end debate.|$|E

It looks fantastic, <b>doing</b> <b>its</b> level best to {{recreate}} 1940s New York on what is probably quite a low budget, and succeeding. It ties into the MCU in ways that feel natural ...There isn't a weak performance in the cast, and even the writing is strong, with compelling plots giving space to subplots which chug along at a nice pace. And the most surprising part? It's actually funny." [...] He was positive about Atwell's performance, but praised D'Arcy as [...] "the breakout star of the cast". Amy Ratcliffe of Nerdist concluded her review of the episode saying [...] "Overall, Agent Carter didn’t {{open the door and}} tiptoe in; it busted through and took charge. Atwell is a magnetic force of nature and seems completely at home in the role, and she’s complemented by D’Arcy and Gjokaj." [...] She also felt that lessons had been learned from Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and thought that all the work put into creating the period setting had paid off. Britt Hayes, reviewing for Screen Crush, felt that the episode [...] "fumbles a little, as most series do when they’re introducing us to a new world", but was positive of Atwell, D'Arcy, and the cinematography. Hayes' major issue was the score, which she explained [...] "often lingers a little too long and feels slightly tone deaf—it definitely cheapens the proceedings, and reminds us that this is television, not film." ...|$|E
