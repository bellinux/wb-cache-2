5|$|The game is {{loosely based}} on {{professional}} wrestling games, but more closely resembles a beat-'em up. The game can be played in two modes: a tournament style single-player game or a grudge match where two players can interact. The matches take place in ten different detailed 3D locations from Springfield, such as the Simpsons' house, the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, the Kwik-E-Mart, and Moe's Tavern. Letters float around in the wrestling ring, and if a wrestler collects <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> they can taunt and temporarily become invincible. A round ends when one wrestler pins their opponent for a three count. Two rounds are needed to win a match.|$|E

In an era of increasingly bitter, partisan politics, Carper's actions and policies placed him at the political center, in keeping with Delaware's consensus style of governing.|$|E
25|$|The classicist John Burnet doubts this account, however, as both Diogenes Laërtius and Cicero wrote {{hundreds}} of years later and as no such persecution of Protagoras is mentioned by contemporaries who make extensive references to this philosopher.

A claim has been made that Protagoras is better classified as an atheist, since he held that if something {{is not able to}} be known it does not exist.|$|E

25|$|One might further {{hypothesize that}} the {{experimental}} treatment regulates cholesterol, because the treatment seems to selectively regulate genes associated with cholesterol. While {{this may be}} true, {{there are a number}} of reasons why making this a firm conclusion based on enrichment alone represents an unwarranted leap of faith. One previously mentioned issue has to do with the observation that gene regulation may have no direct impact on protein regulation: even if the proteins coded for by these genes do nothing other than make cholesterol, showing that their mRNA is altered does not directly tell us what is happening at the protein level. It is quite possible that the amount of these cholesterol-related proteins remains constant under the experimental conditions. Second, even if protein levels do change, perhaps there is always <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> around to make cholesterol as fast as it can be possibly made, that is, another protein, not on our list, is the rate determining step in the process of making cholesterol. Finally, proteins typically play many roles, so these genes may be regulated not because of their shared association with making cholesterol but because of a shared role in a completely independent process.|$|E

Several chaotic ballots resulted in no clear majority for anyone, and Goebel's hand-picked chairman announced {{the man with the}} lowest vote total in the next canvass would be dropped. It turned out to be Stone. This put Stone's backers in a difficult position. They were forced to choose between Hardin, who was seen as a pawn of the railroads, or Goebel, who had turned against their man. <b>Enough</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> sided with Goebel to give him the nomination.

500|$|Eurogamer's Kristan Reed was unimpressed {{with the}} game, calling it [...] "a bit half-baked". He praised {{the opening of}} the game, arguing that, like Hansen himself, the player feels a strong sense of {{disorientation}} as they get used to being on the ship {{in the middle of a}} storm. However, he felt the strong opening soon gives way to clichés. He was highly critical of the absence of a map, arguing that because the environments all look similar, getting lost is a regular occurrence. GameSpot's Carrie Gouskos scored the PlayStation 2 version 6.9 out of 10 and the Xbox version 7.2 out of 10. She argued [...] "Atmospherically, Cold Fear is derivative and predictable, which is a shame considering that it is, at times, an enjoyable action game." [...] Although she praised the outdoor scenes on the boat, she felt there were not <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> with too many [...] "generic indoor locations."

500|$|The two-cent {{piece was}} at first a success, {{circulating}} freely once <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> were issued to be recognized by the public. It initially circulated because of the wartime coin shortage, which was alleviated by the new cent and two-cent piece. [...] Although Pollock reported hoarding of cents in his June 1864 report, he did not thereafter mention such activities. Silver coins still did not circulate {{in much of the}} nation, and the new coins (joined by the three- and five-cent pieces of copper-nickel, first struck in 1865 and 1866 respectively) answered the need for small change. In October 1864, he reported that the demand for both coins had been unprecedented and that every effort was being made to increase production; in his report the next June, he called the two-cent piece [...] "a most convenient and popular coin". The Act of March3, 1865, that provided for the three-cent nickel piece, reduced the legal tender limit of the bronze coins to four cents, while making the newly authorized coin acceptable up to sixty cents.|$|E

500|$|The 2,855,000kg (2,855t) {{passenger}} ferry MV Doña Marilyn sank during Ruby in the Visayan Sea, despite altering {{its course}} {{in an attempt}} to avoid the inner core of the typhoon. Several hours before the ship sank, crew members reported that the engine was failing. [...] The vessel was last spotted about 325km (200mi) southeast of Manila, and was en route from Manila to Tacloban City. According to reports obtained from the Philippine Coast Guard, there were 243confirmed survivors, although reports from the Associated Press suggested that as few as 193people survived. Based on official government reports, the ferry had 451passengers plus 60crew members aboard, although many survivors claim there were over 1,000crew and passengers, citing {{the fact that there were}} 1,200life vests, and there was not <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> for everyone on board at the time of the incident. Around a week after the storm, Manila newspapers reported that there were at least 52people on board who were not officially reported as a passenger or crewman.

500|$|Ctenophores {{used to be}} {{regarded}} as [...] "dead ends" [...] in marine food chains because it was thought their low ratio of organic matter to salt and water made them a poor diet for other animals. It is also often difficult to identify the remains of ctenophores in the guts of possible predators, although the combs sometimes remain intact long enough to provide a clue. Detailed investigation of chum salmon, Oncorhynchus keta, showed that these fish digest ctenophores 20 times as fast as an equal weight of shrimps, and that ctenophores can provide a good diet if there are <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> around. Beroids prey mainly on other ctenophores. Some jellyfish and turtles eat large quantities of ctenophores, and jellyfish may temporarily wipe out ctenophore populations. Since ctenophores and jellyfish often have large seasonal variations in population, most fish that prey on them are generalists, and may have a greater effect on populations than the specialist jelly-eaters. This is underlined by an observation of herbivorous fishes deliberately feeding on gelatinous zooplankton during blooms in the Red Sea. The larvae of some sea anemones are parasites on ctenophores, as are the larvae of some flatworms that parasitize fish when they reach adulthood.|$|E

500|$|Krrish {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics in India. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama {{believed that the}} film surpassed expectations, but felt that there were issues with pacing in first hour. Overall, he deemed Krrish to be [...] "a terrifically exciting and compelling experience", and awarded the film 4.5 of 5 stars. Nikhat Kazmi noted in The Times of India that while the superhero and action sequences were appealing, there were not <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> He was also not excited by the romantic parts, comparing them to a sightseeing tour, first in India and then in Singapore. He said that overall, this film lacks the fun of its predecessor. On the other hand, Raja Sen said that Krrish was infinitely better than KMG, though ultimately {{it was all about}} Hrithik Roshan. Sen and Sukanya Verma, writing for Rediff, both gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, and both said {{that it was a good}} film for children. Sen summarised [...] "So, is it a good superhero movie? No, but it's well-intentioned. It's a full-on kiddie movie, and while a lot of us might be scornful of Krrish, it's heartening to see fantasy officially entering mainstream Bollywood." [...] Verma agreed with other critics that it took too long for the action to get started, and said that a lot of attention was spent showing off Roshan's muscles. He summarised, [...] "Krrish neither has the sleek aura nor the deep-rooted ideology of superheroes. What it does have is a super spirited performance from Hrithik Roshan, which is likely to appeal to children. And that's worth a three-star cheer." [...] Saibal Chatterjee wrote in the Hindustan Times that Krrish is a hackneyed, formulaic masala film, with special effects added on top, and hoped that this would not be the future of Bollywood. Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN condemned the screenplay and thought that the only thing that made the film watchable was the acting of Hrithik Roshan. He gave the film only 2 out of 5 stars, saying [...] "Krrish is only an average film that could have been so much better if the makers had concentrated as hard on its story as they did on its action and stunts." ...|$|E

Talbot said the album showcases [...] "Selena's past and outlines {{what could have been}} her future", and because of the singer's death, the story is incomplete. She called the English offerings [...] "sturdy, generic pop numbers" [...] that would be favored among her Tejano following [...] "but there aren't <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> to prove her strength or breadth as an English-language artist". Talbot said Selena was skillful in crisscrossing [...] "traditional Mexican music with a contemporary American pop sensibility, and that skill doesn't figure with these songs". Towards the end of her review, Talbot said Dreaming of You is [...] "the effervescent pop of her generation". Mario Tarradell of The Dallas Morning News said the album [...] "doesn't deliver", writing that Selena was [...] "revamped to sound like one of pop radio's many generic female vocalist" [...] and that her English recordings lack [...] "the bubbly, effervescent personality, the chica-del-barrio charm" [...] found on her Tejano songs. Tarradell said the English songs were [...] "tepid imitations of Amy Grant and Abdul". Peter Watrous of The New York Times called Dreaming of You [...] "a collection of leftovers" [...] and said the Spanish-language songs [...] "sound better" [...] than Selena's English ones. Watrous said the producers did not ameliorate Selena's English-language tracks and gave their all. He further wrote that [...] "the music is faceless commerce" [...] but that Selena recorded them [...] "so well on the album" [...] that it suggested [...] "she had a good chance of success, working lush ballads in an anonymous pop style that Disney has mastered". Rock music contributor Roger Catlin of the Hartford Courant described Dreaming of You as [...] "a package that hints at the overall talent and immense potential of the young star". Catlin said her English-language works were lacking [...] "technical heroics that have defined [...] in the '90s." [...] but states the singer [...] "is understandably assured" [...] on her Spanish offerings. He said Selena was [...] "low key" [...] and that the material seemed that way because she had only recorded four English-language tracks before her death.|$|E
