5|$|Early {{calculations}} {{suggested that}} there might be white dwarfs whose luminosity varied with a period of around 10 seconds, but searches in the 1960s failed to observe this., § 7.1.1; The first variable white dwarf found was HL Tau 76; in 1965 and 1966, and was observed to vary with a period of approximately 12.5 minutes. The reason for this period being longer than predicted is that the variability of HL Tau 76, like that of the other pulsating variable white dwarfs known, arises from non-radial <b>gravity</b> <b>wave</b> pulsations., § 7. Known types of pulsating white dwarf include the DAV, or ZZ Ceti, stars, including HL Tau 76, with hydrogen-dominated atmospheres and the spectral type DA;, pp.891, 895 DBV, or V777 Her, stars, with helium-dominated atmospheres and the spectral type DB;, p.3525 and GW Vir stars (sometimes subdivided into DOV and PNNV stars), with atmospheres dominated by helium, carbon, and oxygen. GW Vir stars are not, strictly speaking, white dwarfs, but are stars which are in a position on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram between the asymptotic giant branch and the white dwarf region. They may be called pre-white dwarfs. These variables all exhibit small (1%–30%) variations in light output, arising from a superposition of vibrational modes with periods of hundreds to thousands of seconds. Observation of these variations gives asteroseismological evidence about the interiors of white dwarfs.|$|E
25|$|A {{pulsating}} {{white dwarf}} {{is a white}} dwarf star whose luminosity varies due to non-radial <b>gravity</b> <b>wave</b> pulsations within itself. The first pulsating white dwarf was discovered by Arlo U. Landolt when he observed in 1965 and 1966 that the luminosity of HL Tau 76 varied with a period of approximately 12.5 minutes.|$|E
25|$|Within physics, the Department of Theoretical Physics {{was set up}} by Bhabha, who {{conducted}} research in high energy physics and Condensed Matter Physics. The department worked on the major advances in this period such as gauge theories, string theory, renormalisation and superconductivity. The Department of Astrophysics works in areas like stellar binaries, gravitational waves and cosmology. TIFR is involved in building India's first <b>gravity</b> <b>wave</b> detector. The High Energy Physics Department, TIFR has been involved in major accelerator projects like the KEK, Tevatron, LEP and the LHC. TIFR also runs the Pelletron particle accelerator facility. Bhabha's motivation resulted in the development of an NMR spectrometer for solid state studies. The Department of Condensed Matter Physics and Material Sciences also conducts experimental research in high-temperature superconductivity, nanoelectronics and nanophotonics.|$|E

25|$|The large mass of rock, {{acted as}} a {{monolith}} (thus resembling high-angle asteroid impact), struck with great force the sediments at bottom of Gilbert Inlet {{at the head of}} the bay. The impact created a large crater and displaced and folded recent and Tertiary deposits and sedimentary layers to an unknown depth. The displaced water and the displacement and folding of the sediments broke and uplifted 1,300 feet of ice along the entire front of the Lituya Glacier at the north end of Gilbert Inlet. Also, the impact and the sediment displacement by the rockfall resulted in an air bubble and in water splashing action that reached the 1,720 foot (524 m.) elevation on the other side of the head of Gilbert Inlet. The same rockfall impact, in combination with the strong ground movements, the net vertical crustal uplift of about 3.5 feet, and an overall tilting seaward of the entire crustal block on which Lituya Bay was situated, generated the giant solitary <b>gravity</b> <b>wave</b> which swept the main body of the bay.|$|E
25|$|The {{power and}} nature of the weapons varies, and is not fully {{understood}} in all cases. The smallest of the weapons seem to have been considerably more powerful than conventional space-borne weapons, and at least one is deemed capable of destroying a planet-sized object from a distance exceeding 100 AU. It is suggested that some of the weapons can have negative effects upon stellar bodies. Their level of sophistication differs widely—the most basic cache weapons appear to be radical extensions of otherwise conventional principles, such as relativistic projectile weapons with antimatter or neutronium ammunition and gamma-ray lasers. Others, however, make use of <b>gravity</b> <b>wave</b> effects and other complex phenomena, with certain weapons even containing microscopic black holes. Once a weapon is programmed to fire, the process cannot be stopped by any method short of destroying it. Some of the weapons appear to be single use, including some deployed in the novel Absolution Gap (in several cases this is because the weapon destroys itself when firing), while others are at least theoretically capable of being reloaded, though this is never attempted.|$|E

50|$|For {{a certain}} water depth, surface <b>gravity</b> <b>waves</b> - i.e. waves {{occurring}} at the air-water interface and gravity {{as the only}} force restoring it to flatness - propagate faster with increasing wavelength. On the other hand, for a given (fixed) wavelength, <b>gravity</b> <b>waves</b> in deeper water have a larger phase speed than in shallower water. In contrast with the behavior of <b>gravity</b> <b>waves,</b> capillary waves (i.e. only forced by surface tension) propagate faster for shorter wavelengths.|$|R
40|$|Internal <b>gravity</b> <b>waves</b> {{are one of}} the {{important}} phenomena in understanding the general circulation as well as eddy motions in the atmosphere, particularly in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere.

2500|$|Water can {{be moved}} through coral reefs in various ways, {{including}} current rings, surface waves, internal waves and tidal changes. [...] Movement is generally created by tides and wind. As tides interact with varying bathymetry and wind mixes with surface water, internal waves are created. An internal wave is a <b>gravity</b> <b>wave</b> that moves along density stratification within the ocean. When a water parcel encounters a different density it will oscillate and create internal waves. While internal waves generally have a lower frequency than surface waves, they often form as a single wave that breaks into multiple waves as it hits a slope and moves upward. This vertical break up of internal waves causes significant diapycnal mixing and turbulence. Internal waves can act as nutrient pumps, bringing plankton and cool nutrient-rich water up to the surface.|$|E
40|$|Natural and {{man-made}} {{events like}} earthquakes and nuclear explosions launch atmospheric <b>gravity</b> <b>waves</b> (AGW) into the atmosphere. Since the particle density decreases exponentially with height, the <b>gravity</b> <b>waves</b> increase exponentially in amplitude as they propagate toward {{the upper atmosphere}} and ionosphere. As atmospheric <b>gravity</b> <b>waves</b> approach the ionospheric heights, the neutral particles carried by <b>gravity</b> <b>waves</b> collide with electrons and ions, setting these particles in motion. This motion of charged particles manifests itself by wave-like fluctuations and disturbances that are known as traveling ionospheric disturbances (TID). The perturbation in the total electron content due to TID's is derived analytically from first principles. Using the tilted dipole magnetic field approximation and a Chapman layer distribution for the electron density, the variations of the total electron content versus the line-of-sight direction are numerically analyzed. The temporal variation associated with the total electron content measurements due to AGW's {{can be used as}} a means of detecting characteristics of the <b>gravity</b> <b>waves.</b> As an example, detection of tsunami generated earthquakes from their associated atmospheric <b>gravity</b> <b>waves</b> using the Global Positioning System is simulated...|$|R

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the generation of}} mesoscale <b>gravity</b> <b>waves</b> from upper-tropospheric jet-front systems, five different life cycles of baroclinic waves are simulated with a high-resolution mesoscale model (MM 5 with 10 -km grid spacing). The baroclinicity (and the growth rates) of the baroclinic waves differs significantly among these five experiments {{as a result of}} using different tropospheric static stability and tropopause geometry for the initial two-dimensional baroclinic jet. After a short initial adjustment, the baroclinic waves in each experiment grow nearly linearly for as long as five days before the final nonlinear growth stage. Vertically propagating mesoscale <b>gravity</b> <b>waves</b> are generated universally in the exit region of the upper-tropospheric jet streaks near the tropopause level at the later stage of quasi-linear growth and the early stage of nonlinear growth of baroclinic waves. The synoptic environments of <b>gravity</b> <b>waves</b> are consistent with previous studies of typical mesoscale <b>gravity</b> <b>waves.</b> The low-stratospheric <b>gravity</b> <b>waves</b> generated from the upper-level jet streak in these experiments have a horizontal wavelength of 75 - 175 km and an intrinsic frequency 3 - 10 times of the Coriolis parameter. The intrinsic frequency of these <b>gravity</b> <b>waves</b> appears to be directly correlated with the growth rate and the strength of the baroclinic waves. In general, the faster the growth rate of the baroclinic waves, the higher the intrinsic frequency of the <b>gravity</b> <b>waves.</b> Similar frequencies of the <b>gravity</b> <b>waves</b> are found in experiments with smaller quasi-linear growth rates of baroclinic waves but with significantly different initial tropospheric static stability and tropopause geometry. The residuals of the nonlinear balance equation are used to assess the flow imbalance. It is also suggested that growth of imbalance {{is directly related to the}} growth rate of baroclinic waves and thus the frequency of primary <b>gravity</b> <b>waves</b> of interest. Diagnosis of flow imbalance suggests that balance adjustment, as a generalization of geostrophic adjustment, may be responsible for the generation of the <b>gravity</b> <b>waves</b> in the upper-tropospheric jet-front systems...|$|R

As the preferential directions of wave propagation were found to be mainly towards the north and north-east in April and May at the Allahabad observation site, one can assume that the generation source of the <b>gravity</b> <b>waves</b> should be over the continent 250 – 300 km away in the south and south-west direction.
