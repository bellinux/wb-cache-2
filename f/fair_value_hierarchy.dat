The {{debate around}} the {{usefulness}} of fair value {{as a basis for}} measuring financial instruments has become increasingly topical and, in recent times, has attracted the attention of various market participants {{as a result of the}} global credit crisis which developed during 2007. The qualitative characteristics of relevance and reliability are central to any analysis regarding {{the usefulness of}} fair value as a financial instrument measurement basis. This study therefore investigates the relevance and reliability of the fair value measurements disclosed by the four largest South African banks in their 2008 annual financial statements in order to determine whether fair value is the most useful basis for measuring the majority of the financial instruments of South African banks. The financial instrument categories and <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> <b>hierarchy</b> defined in International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are used to perform a content analysis on the 2008 annual financial statements of the banks included in the study, in order to conclude on the relevance and reliability, respectively, of the financial instrument fair values provided. Collectively, an analysis of the financial instrument categories applied and an investigation of the differences between the fair values and carrying values of financial instruments not measured at fair value suggest that fair value is not the most relevant basis for measuring the majority of the financial assets of all of the banks included in the study, and is also not the most relevant basis for measuring the majority of the financial liabilities of three of the four banks included in the study. Based on their <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> <b>hierarchy</b> classification, the fair values of the majority of both the financial assets and financial liabilities of the banks included in the study were not found to be reliable.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} utilizes empirical {{methods to}} shed light on the current debate over whether to adopt <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> accounting for loans held for long term. Proponents of <b>fair</b> <b>valuing</b> loans argue that reporting loans at their <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> enhances the overall transparency of financial reporting. In contrast, opponents are against applying <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> accounting to loans because <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> cannot be measured reliably in the case of loans held for long term. Therefore, the key question here is whether loan <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> are sufficiently reliable to provide more relevant and transparent information compared to traditional measurements of loans. To explore this, I compare <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> disclosures of loans under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107 (SFAS 107), Disclosures about <b>Fair</b> <b>Value</b> of Financial Instruments, with traditional measurements of loans reported on balance sheets. More specifically, this study asks two research questions; (i) whether loan <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> provide more relevant information about future loan losses compared to traditional measurements of loans and (ii) whether banks intentionally manage their <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> estimates of loans when they are financially distressed. SFAS 107 mandates the disclosure of <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> for financial instruments with the objective of providing investors with more relevant information about firms' future cash flows. However, the results show that <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> measurements of loans explained variation in future loan losses, which capture cash flows from loans, less than traditional cost-based measurements of loans. In addition, I find evidence suggesting that financially distressed banks overstated the <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> of their loan portfolios and that <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> of loans in the aggregate lagged considerably behind the market values of loans during the recent credit crisis. Overall, my results suggest that <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> disclosures in bank loan portfolios contain relatively less information about future cash flows because they are measured unreliably and they suffer from a similar lack of timeliness as reported carrying values...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{objectives}} of general-purpose financial reporting is {{to provide information about}} the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity that is useful {{to a wide range of}} users in making economic decisions. The current focus on potentially increased relevance of fair value accounting weighed against issues of reliability has failed to consider the potential impact on the predictive ability of accounting. Based on a sample of international (non-U. S.) banks from 24 countries during 2009 - 2012, we test the usefulness of fair values in improving the predictive ability of earnings. First, we find that the increasing use of fair values on balance-sheet financial instruments enhances the ability of current earnings to predict future earnings and cash flows. Second, we provide evidence that the <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> <b>hierarchy</b> classification choices affect the ability of earnings to predict future cash flows and future earnings. More precisely, we find that the non-discretionary fair value component (Level 1 assets) improves the predictability of current earnings whereas the discretionary fair value components (Level 2 and Level 3 assets) weaken the predictive power of earnings. Third, we find a consistent and strong association between factors reflecting country-wide institutional structures and predictive power of fair values based on discretionary measurement inputs (Level 2 and Level 3 assets and liabilities).

40|$|PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The {{purpose of}} the study is to analyze whether investors see fair values of {{mark-to-market}} financial instruments as more value relevant than fair values of mark-to-model financial instruments. Additional research questions set out to explore if certain company characteristics {{have an effect on the}} value relevance of fair values that are based on subjective valuation models. We expect the value relevance of mark-to-model financial instruments to be lower for companies with higher leverage ratios. Additionally, mark-to-model financial instruments are expected to be less value relevant for small companies. DATA A sample of 98 European publicly listed banks is used to conduct the empirical study. Data on the amount of fair value financial instruments held by the banks is collected from annual reports for fiscal year 2009. We utilize disclosures mandated by the IFRS 7 <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> <b>hierarchy</b> which requires companies to categorize fair value instruments into three levels based on the objectivity of the inputs used in the valuation models. Additional data needed for the regression models is collected from the Thomson Datastream and Thomson Worldscope databases. RESULTS Results of the empirical study support our main hypothesis, i. e. that fair values based on market data are perceived by financial markets as more value relevant than fair values based on valuation models that utilize subjective inputs. For our additional research questions on the effect of company characteristics (leverage and size) on the value relevance of fair values we find no conclusive evidence.
