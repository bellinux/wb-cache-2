5|$|Many {{extensive}} {{areas of}} <b>Japanese</b> <b>knotweed</b> (Fallopia japonica) {{are on the}} site. Heritage stations of common butterbur and hart's-tongue fern, colonized by invasive species, are managed by manual removal and disposal for incineration.|$|E
5|$|<b>Japanese</b> <b>Knotweed</b> Fallopia japonica is an {{invasive}} species that threatens Jersey's biodiversity. It is easily recognisable and has hollow stems with small white flowers that are produced in late summer. Other non-native {{species on the}} island include the Colorado beetle, burnet rose and oak processionary moth.|$|E
5|$|Northern {{hardwood}} {{trees are}} common in the Fishing Creek watershed. Ruffed grouse are common along Little Fishing Creek and its tributaries north of Iola. There are populations of <b>Japanese</b> <b>knotweed,</b> an invasive plant, along the creek and its tributaries south of Pennsylvania Route 118.|$|E
5000|$|The {{introduced}} Asian {{plants of}} <b>Japanese</b> and Giant <b>Knotweed</b> are common throughout {{the town and}} surrounding woodlands and are colloquially known as [...] "elephant ears".|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} {{strain of}} Aphalara itadori is from Kyushu {{and is the}} strain released in the UK. Its home range is the Kumamoto prefecture, of the Kyushu Island, in Southern Japan. The southern strain attacks <b>Japanese</b> and Bohemian <b>knotweed.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Japanese</b> <b>knotweeds</b> {{are among}} the most {{invasive}} organisms in the world. Their recent expansion into salt marsh habitat provides a unique opportunity to investigate how invasives establish in new environments. We used morphology, cytology, and AFLP genotyping to identify taxa and clonal diversity in roadside and salt marsh populations. We conducted a greenhouse study to determine the ability to tolerate salt and whether salt marsh populations are more salt tolerant than roadside populations as measured by the efficiency of PSII, leaf area, succulence, height, root-to-shoot ratio, and total biomass. Clonal diversity was extremely low with one F. japonica clone and five F. ×bohemica genotypes. The two taxa were significantly different in several traits, but did not vary in biomass or plasticity of any trait. All traits were highly plastic in response to salinity, but differed significantly among genets. Despite this variation, plants from the salt marsh habitats did not perform better in the salt treatment, suggesting that they are not better adapted to tolerate salt. Instead, our data support the hypothesis that plasticity in salt tolerance traits may allow these taxa to live in saline habitats without specific adaptation to tolerate salt. Read More: [URL]...|$|R
5|$|Five {{species of}} shrubs {{grow in the}} {{vicinity}} of Mahoning Creek, its floodplain, and the nearby slopes: smooth alder, silky dogwood, gray dogwood, spicebush, and American elderberry. 11 herb species also grow in this location. These include skunk cabbage, bloodroot, sensitive fern, sedge, wood anemone, woolgrass, and others. There are also invasive plants such as multiflora rose, <b>Japanese</b> <b>knotweed,</b> and garlic mustard in the area.|$|E
5|$|The local Biodiversity Action Plan {{recommends}} {{land management}} measures {{to control the}} spread of ragwort and bracken and identifies four non-native, invasive species as threatening native biodiversity: <b>Japanese</b> <b>knotweed,</b> rhododendron, New Zealand flatworm and mink. It also identifies problems of over-grazing resulting in the impoverishment of moorland and upland habitats {{and a loss of}} native woodland, caused by the large numbers of red deer and sheep.|$|E
5|$|Manual {{removal of}} the <b>Japanese</b> <b>knotweed</b> has {{preserved}} heritage stations of common butterbur and hart's-tongue fern. Early hand pruning was conducive to orchids. The late mowing seems rather ineffective. The grubbing-up of the Canada golden-rod and American asters was successful. The bush clearing and selective logging have helped maintain the wood-fringe with narrow-leaved everlasting-pea and liquorice milkvetch. Common spotted orchid, zigzag clover and lesser butterfly-orchid, species non-adapted to open areas, benefited areas without clearing. The low dry-stone walls probably favored the installation of viviparous lizard or common wall lizard, observed in 2013, but also the consolidation of the hart's-tongue fern population.|$|E
50|$|Fallopia sachalinensis (giant {{knotweed}} or Sakhalin <b>knotweed</b> <b>Japanese</b> オオイタドリ ooitadori, Russian Горец сахалинский, Гречиха сахалинская; syn. Polygonum sachalinense F.Schmidt, Reynoutria sachalinensis (F.Schmidt) Nakai) is {{a species}} of Fallopia native to northeastern Asia in northern Japan (Hokkaidō, Honshū) and the far east of Russia (Sakhalin and the southern Kurile Islands).|$|R
40|$|In our {{research}} invasive alien knotweed taxa sampled in Slovenia were identified using selected molecular methods. The {{aim was to}} find out whether Slovene samples of Fallopia sect. Reynoutria or sect. Sermentosae taxa can be unambiguously distinguished {{on the basis of the}} combination of chosen chloroplast and nuclear DNA markers. We used PCR RFLP analysis of the trnK intron of chloroplast DNA in combination with amplification of nuclear, simple sequence repeat (SSR) or microsatellite loci, KW 6, potentially diagnostic F. sachalinensis-specific marker. According to the predominantly maternal inheritance of cpDNA in crosses of Fallopia species and based on PCR RFLP profiles of the trnK intron of cpDNA we could also make assumptions about the direction of hybridization between <b>Japanese</b> and giant <b>knotweed.</b> We tried to find out if the situation on this phenomenon in Slovenia was the same as in Europe, where hybridization between these two invasive alien knotweed species is unidirectional, with F. japonica (var. japonica), in European flora present as cytologically and genetically unified female clone, as the female (maternal) parent...|$|R
2500|$|According to Gail Wallin, {{executive}} director of the Invasive Species Council of B.C., and co-chair of the Canadian Council on Invasive Species, by 2015 it was found in all provinces in Canada except Manitoba and Saskatchewan. In Vancouver the aggressive plant went under [...] "four lanes of highway and have popped up on the other side." [...] At Mission Point Park in Davis Bay, British Columbia municipal crews attempted to eradicate it by digging out the plant to a depth of about three metres with an excavator. It grew back twice as large the next year. To avoid an epidemic as in the United Kingdom, some provinces in Canada are pushing for relaxation of provincial limits on the use of herbicides close to waterways so knotweed can be aggressively managed with strong chemicals. In spite of its status as an invasive species it is still sometimes sold or swapped in Canada as an edible [...] "false bamboo." [...] Bohemian knotweed, a mutant hybrid— which is a cross between <b>Japanese</b> and giant <b>knotweed</b> that produces huge quantities of viable seeds —now accounts for about 80 per cent of knotweed infestations in British Columbia.|$|R
5|$|Numerous {{invasive}} plants live {{along the}} Saw Mill River. Porcelain berry is a vine with white berries that wraps around native trees and strangles them. Oriental bittersweet is also present along the river, {{and it is}} slowly displacing the native American bittersweet. Oriental bitterweet can also form hybrids with the native bittersweet and making identification harder. Japanese honeysuckle and <b>Japanese</b> <b>knotweed</b> are two other invasive vines native to Asia. In addition, purple loosestrife, a perennial herb with magenta flower stalks, is also present along the river.|$|E
5|$|The Tualatin Riverkeepers, {{a nonprofit}} {{watershed}} council based in Tigard; Clean Water Services, a public utility that protects water {{resources in the}} Tualatin River watershed, and the Tualatin Hills Park & Recreation District (THPRD) have formed the Tualatin Basin Invasive Species Working Group to identify and eradicate invasive plants that displace native plants, cause erosion, and diminish water quality. The five plants considered most threatening are <b>Japanese</b> <b>knotweed,</b> meadow knapweed, giant hogweed, garlic mustard and purple loosestrife. The Oregon Department of Agriculture {{and the city of}} Tigard are working to eradicate giant hogweed from lower Fanno Creek.|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} wildflower {{species in the}} uplands and rock outcroppings of the Turkey Hill Oxbow. These include white baneberry, northern maidenhair fern, spikenard, blue cohosh, foamflower, false Solomon's seal, purple trillium, and wild columbine. Animals inhabiting the areas surrounding the pools include pickerel frogs, green frogs, wood ducks, and snapping turtles. Plants in this location include broadleaf arrowhead, northern blueflag, manna grasses, water starwort, and several varieties of sedges. <b>Japanese</b> <b>knotweed</b> has been seen near Interstate 80 on the northern edges of the Turkey Hill Oxbow.|$|E
5|$|Fishers, {{medium-sized}} weasels, were reintroduced to Pine Creek Gorge {{as part of}} {{an effort}} to establish a healthy population of fishers in Pennsylvania. Prior to the lumber era, fishers were numerous throughout the forests of Pennsylvania. They are generalized predators and will hunt any smaller creatures in their territory, including porcupines. Elk have been reintroduced west of the gorge in Clinton County and occasionally wander near the west rim of the canyon. Coyotes have come back on their own. Invasive insect species in the gorge include gypsy moth larvae, which eat all the leaves off trees, especially oaks, and hemlock woolly adelgids, which weaken and kill hemlocks. Invasive plant species include purple loosestrife and <b>Japanese</b> <b>knotweed.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Fonteyn Kill and its {{riparian}} zone {{are home to}} a variety of species. Caddisflies, clams and mussels, crayfish (Astacidae), damselflies, gammarids, isopods (Asellidae), oligochaetes, black flies, leeches, chironomids, bladder snails, and other snails were recorded in the stream in 2010. Trees {{along the banks of the}} Fonteyn Kill include American elms, sugar maples, black cherries, Norway maples, and red maples, while barberry, privet, holly, <b>Japanese</b> <b>knotweed,</b> honeysuckle, spicebush, common reeds, and Japanese roses make up the kill's riparian shrubs. Carp, mallards, great blue herons, frogs, snapping turtles, and other birds also reside in and around the stream. A 1924 source observed that trout fishing occurred on the kill.|$|E
5|$|The {{plant life}} around the Griffin Reservoir on Leggetts Creek {{includes}} various native trees and understory plants. From the reservoir downstream to an intake pond near Interstate 81, the creek's riparian buffer contains old growth forest, including tulip poplar trees. In addition to tulip popular, hemlock and pine also {{occur in the}} Griffin Mills reach of the creek. Near Leggetts Gap, the creek has some riparian buffering. Even in its lower reaches, the it has a stable vegetative cover in some areas. However, other areas are full of invasive plants. Major invasive plant species include <b>Japanese</b> <b>knotweed,</b> Norway Maple, and Ailanthus. Overall, the riparian buffer of the creek mainly consists of grassland and forested land.|$|E
5|$|Bluebells are {{a species}} of {{deciduous}} woodland over much of their range, flowering and leafing early before the canopy closes in late spring. They may also be found growing under bracken or <b>Japanese</b> <b>knotweed,</b> perennial plants which also form stands with a dense summer canopy. They are most successful on slightly acid soils; the same niche in alkaline conditions may be occupied by other species such as Mercurialis perennis. As a species adapted to woodlands, the young shoots are able to penetrate through {{a thick layer of}} leaf litter, and bluebells are often used as an indicator species to identify ancient woodland. Bluebells are also frequently found in hedgerows, and in the west of their range they can be found growing in open habitats, including coastal meadows. Bluebell flowers are rich in pollen and nectar, and are chiefly pollinated by bumblebees, although they are also visited by various other insects. They are a host species for the parasitic fungus Uromyces muscari, which causes bluebell rust. The ability of H.non-scripta to take up phosphorus from the soil is greatly enhanced by the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizae in its roots.|$|E
25|$|Persicaria capitata {{for another}} plant species called <b>Japanese</b> <b>knotweed.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Japanese</b> <b>Knotweed,</b> an {{invasive}} species, {{has been}} observed {{on the banks of}} Huntsville Creek. This plant was at one point contributing to streambank erosion on the creek. However, in 2010 the Pennsylvania Environmental Council received a grant to remove the <b>Japanese</b> <b>Knotweed</b> {{and replace it with a}} riparian buffer consisting of native trees and shrubs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Japanese</b> <b>knotweed</b> {{flowers are}} valued by some beekeepers as an {{important}} source of nectar for honeybees, at a time of year when little else is flowering. <b>Japanese</b> <b>knotweed</b> yields a monofloral honey, usually called bamboo honey by northeastern U.S. beekeepers, like a mild-flavoured version of buckwheat honey (a related plant also in the Polygonaceae).|$|E
25|$|<b>Japanese</b> <b>knotweed</b> is classed as an {{unwanted}} organism in New Zealand and is established {{in some parts}} of the country.|$|E
25|$|He also {{introduced}} <b>Japanese</b> <b>knotweed</b> (Fallopia japonica), {{which has become}} a highly invasive weed in Europe and North America. All derive from a single female plant collected by Siebold.|$|E
25|$|In Scotland, the Wildlife and Natural Environment (Scotland) Act 2011 {{came into}} force in July 2012 that {{superseded}} the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. This act states {{that is an}} offence to spread intentionally or unintentionally <b>Japanese</b> <b>knotweed</b> (or other non-native invasive species).|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} was taken on 9 March 2010 in the UK to release {{into the wild}} a Japanese psyllid insect, Aphalara itadori. Its diet is highly specific to <b>Japanese</b> <b>knotweed</b> and shows good potential for its control. Controlled release trials began in South Wales in 2016.|$|E
25|$|The most {{effective}} {{method of control}} is by herbicide application close to the flowering stage in late summer or autumn. In some cases, {{it is possible to}} eradicate <b>Japanese</b> <b>knotweed</b> in one growing season using only herbicides. Glyphosate is widely used as it is non-persistent and, certain formulations, may be used in or near water.|$|E
25|$|The young stems are edible as {{a spring}} vegetable, with a flavour similar to {{extremely}} sour rhubarb. In some locations, semi-cultivating <b>Japanese</b> <b>knotweed</b> for food {{has been used}} as a means of controlling knotweed populations that invade sensitive wetland areas and drive out the native vegetation. It is eaten in Japan as sansai or wild foraged vegetable.|$|E
25|$|<b>Japanese</b> <b>knotweed</b> {{has a large}} {{underground}} network of roots (rhizomes). To eradicate the plant the roots need to be killed. All above-ground portions of the plant need to be controlled repeatedly for several years in order to weaken and kill the entire patch. Picking the right herbicide is essential, as it must travel through the plant and into the root system below.|$|E
25|$|European adventurer Philipp Franz von Siebold transported <b>Japanese</b> <b>knotweed</b> from a Japanese volcano to Holland. By 1850 a {{specimen}} from this plant {{was added to}} the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. It was favoured by gardeners because it looked like bamboo and grew everywhere. Ann Conolly provided the first authoritative work on the history and distribution of the plant in the UK and Europe in the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Identification of <b>Japanese</b> <b>knotweed</b> is {{not always}} easy. Many other plants are {{suspected}} of being knotweed, due often to the similar appearance of leaves and stems. Dogwood, lilac, Houttuynia (Houttuynia cordata), ornamental Bistorts such as Red Bistort (Persicaria amplexicaulis), lesser knotweed (Persicaria campanulata), Himalayan Balsam (Impatiens glandulifera), Broadleaved Dock (Rumex obtusifolius), Bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis), bamboo, Himalayan Honeysuckle (Leycesteria formosa), and Russian Vine (Fallopia baldschuanica) have been suspected of being Fallopia japonica.|$|E
25|$|The Lake was {{the last}} of Central Park's bodies of water to be renovated by the Central Park Conservancy, in a project to enhance both its {{ecological}} and scenic aspects. In the summer of 2007, the first phase of a restoration of the Lake and its shoreline plantings commenced, with replanting using native shrubs and understory trees around the northern end of the Lake, from Bank Rock Bay – a narrow cove in the northwest corner that had become a silted-up algae-covered stand of aggressively invasive Phragmites reeds – to Bow Bridge, which received replicas of its four original Italianate cast-iron vases, overspilling with annuals. In the earliest stages, invasive non-native plants like <b>Japanese</b> <b>knotweed</b> were eradicated, the slopes were regraded with added humus and protected with landscaping burlap to stabilize the slopes while root systems became established and leaf litter developed.|$|E
25|$|The {{population}} remained consistently below 2000 {{across the}} ages. The number of houses increased from 152 (including Wixoe and Chilton Street) in 1674 to 852 in 1991, and 950 in 2015; living space standards increased {{dramatically in the}} last century. Unusually for a settlement of just over 2000, it has {{a full range of}} services: bank, butcher, doctors, library, co-op, off-licence, ironmonger, five cafes, four public houses – three serving food – one a hotel, restaurants, take-aways (Chinese, fish and chips), four antique shops – one a large emporium, pharmacy, hairdressers, post office with news and stationery, vintage fashion boutique, four churches, physiotherapy, photographer, health food, alternative medicine, undertaker, art gallery, architect, gift shops, optician, florist, accountant, solicitor, beauty treatments, diet advice, farm food and pet supplies, sandwich shop, estate agents, bed and breakfasts, bookshop, stables, auction, printer, domestic help, <b>Japanese</b> <b>knotweed</b> treatment, advertising, car bodywork, car repairs, architectural ironmongery, taxi, 9-hole golf course, garden bulbs, jam maker, fisheries, website design, many trades......farms, pedigree sheep and the Nuttery, a community woodland, winner of the Best Conservation Project in the Anglia in Bloom competition 2011.|$|E
500|$|The Blaise Castle estate {{contains}} {{a variety of}} trees and plant life, also providing cover for birds and small mammals. [...] Further downstream, just above Sea Mills, Himalayan Balsam and <b>Japanese</b> <b>Knotweed,</b> both invasive riverside plants have established themselves. [...] Ducks and moorhen can be found along many stretches of the river, with gulls and estuary birds near the mouth.|$|E
500|$|The slough {{watershed}} {{lies in the}} Portland/Vancouver Basin ecoregion, part of the Willamette Valley ecoregion {{designated by}} the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Black cottonwood, red osier dogwood, willow, Oregon white oak, and Oregon ash grow in scattered locations throughout the watershed, while wapato and Columbia sedge thrive in a few places. In the slough itself, macrophytes and algae sometimes restrict water flow and reduce water quality. Golf courses and athletic fields near the slough consist mainly of non-native grasses. [...] Developed plots with houses or businesses often have deciduous street trees, grasses, occasional conifers, {{and a variety of}} native and non-native shrubs. Invasive plants include Himalayan blackberry, English ivy, reed canarygrass, purple loosestrife, and <b>Japanese</b> <b>knotweed.</b>|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} [...] non-native, {{invasive}} {{species have been}} identified as a threat to native biodiversity, including Giant Hogweed, <b>Japanese</b> <b>Knotweed</b> and Rhododendron. In May 2008 it was announced that psyllid lice from Japan, which feed on the Knotweed, may be introduced to the UK to bring the plant under control. This would be the first time that an alien species has been used in Britain in this way. Scientists at the Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux International do not believe the lice will cause any environmental damage. Over-grazing caused by the large numbers of Red Deer and sheep has also resulted in the impoverishment of moorland and upland habitats and a loss of native woodland.|$|E
