Lucky is seen wearing a pink nightgown behind the curtains, {{standing}} on her billboard with fluffy white cotton balls attached to the edges, inside her mansion and shots of her out on the balcony. As beautiful and rich as she is, on set she sits on the star-shape in the sky, as she is acting, she is looking quite distressed. After the first chorus, she goes to the hotel mansion to the flowers, then she leaves and sits down and gets a mirror. Next, Lucky opens the door to reveal a handsome man, who then takes her in his arms, as the director yells [...] "Cut! We've got it". Lucky then walks off-set into the studio, replying to the director: [...] "Finally! We've done it fifty-million times!" [...] She then goes to have her hair and makeup done; with Spears standing unnoticed and very worried looking by her side. Lucky is then seen in a shiny gray evening gown at the Academy Awards accepting her award for Best Actress. Lucky looks happy as she accepts it and smiles at her fans but is soon revealed that this is not true happiness. She makes her way away from her screaming fans and back into her limo, where she unexpectedly finds an ornate <b>hand</b> <b>mirror</b> that was used on the film set. She looks back to the crowd to see who has left it and sees Spears leaning forward in the crowd. The limo drives away, leaving Spears behind on the red carpet. The video ends with Lucky crying herself to sleep, her make-up already stained on her face. The curtains close, ending the video.|$|E

2500|$|This {{caricature}} offers various {{starting points}} for an art-historical analysis. It was published {{three years after}} Darwin's work The Descent of Man (1871). Here, Darwin finally takes a stand and argues that humans and monkeys share a common ancestor. In the caricature, however, this view is put into question. Moreover, it goes back on the widespread assumption that humans exhibit certain animal features – the ape as a mirror for humankind so to speak. In this respect the caricature stands also {{in the tradition of}} vanitas which is symbolised by the <b>hand</b> <b>mirror</b> reflecting human stupidity. The fact that the ape-like Darwin is holding the mirror and not the real ape shows that Darwin and his theory should be ridiculed. Darwin himself has acknowledged that [...] " [...] has given man a pedigree of prodigious length, but not, it may be said, of noble quality." [...] Consequently, the ape is not enhanced in status through his kinship with man.|$|E

30|$|<b>Mirror</b> <b>hand</b> (ulnar dimelia) is an {{extremely}} rare congenital anomaly of the upper limb [1]. Characteristically there is duplication of the ulna with both ulnae facing each other [2, 3], absent radius and multiple fingers which are symmetrical around the midline. There are few descriptions of <b>mirror</b> <b>hand</b> deformity with different variants in the literature. Al-Qattan and Al-Thunayan [4] proposed a classification of <b>mirror</b> <b>hand</b> deformity based on {{presence or absence of}} other congenital anomalies and the type of forearm bones present. Type  1 includes ulnar dimelia, type  2 includes two ulnae and one radius, type  3 includes one radius and one ulna, type  4 includes associated anomalies (syndromic) and type  5 includes multiple hands on a single limb. In the literature several variants of <b>mirror</b> <b>hand</b> deformity have been described. Multiple fingers with one ulna and one distinct radius [5], multiple fingers with two ulnae (one vestigial) and one radius [6] and multiple fingers with two ulnae (one vestigial) and one radius with duplicated proximal humerus [7] have been described. In the literature, no case has been reported so far with type  1 <b>mirror</b> <b>hand</b> variant, in which complete duplication of hand with seven fingers and double ulna occur and one ulna follows the other, instead of facing each other as mirror image.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{a representation of}} a low-cost rigid-frame exoskeleton glove {{that is used to}} track finger-joint flexion mapped onto a robotic hand to mimic user movements. The overall setup consists of an exoskeleton glove (exo-glove), sensors, a microcontroller, and a telerobotic hand. The design of the exo-glove is crafted to fit onto a left hand. SolidWorks was used for the prototype designs which were then sent to the Stratasys 400 rapid prototyping machine to be 3 D printed in ABS-M 30 plastic. The exo-glove houses five rotary position sensors and three flexible sensors to track angle changes of the finger joints from two fingers and a thumb. Five low-pass filters are implemented as signal filtering for the rotary position sensors. An Arduino Mega microcontroller is connected to the sensors of the exo-glove and processes the input values. Using an open-loop controller to control the robotic hand, the values processed by the microcontroller from the exo-glove are sent to the servo motors on the robotic hand to operate the corresponding fingers of the user. Throughout the initial calibration and testing phase, each sensor was tested individually to ensure the sensor functionally performs well. Signal analysis was conducted on the sensors at steady state and while in operation to show fluctuations in sensor readings and response to finger flexion. Experimental results show that averaging sensor data in the processing code yields smoother values and better precision. Due to the use of low-pass filtering with the rotary position sensors, the data sets collected were grouped together tightly compared to the flex sensors without filtering. However, the actual angles measured were not accurately portrayed in sensor readings. The true flexion angles were compared in the data samplings to find a variety of ranges spanning around the angles desired to track. Many of the actual flexion angles were offset from the sensor readings by a variation of degrees, but the data shows the sensor readings were able to follow the general magnitude of the true flexion angles. The precision seen in the data was also apparent in the robotic <b>hand</b> <b>mirroring</b> the posture. Changes in sensor readings caused jerking movements to occur in the robotic fingers but were able to maintain an overall flexion mirroring of the RF exo-glove. There is quarter-second delay between the exo-glove sensor reading and the robotic <b>hand</b> <b>mirroring</b> capability when not implementing averaging. When averaging the sensor values, there was a delay of more than half a second between the exo-glove posture and robotic <b>hand</b> <b>mirroring...</b>|$|R
