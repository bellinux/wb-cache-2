However, it had not previously been known whether a prime <b>gap</b> of <b>size</b> 1000 existed. The objective {{of this article was}} {{to be the first to}} find a prime <b>gap</b> of <b>size</b> 1000, by using a systematic method that would also apply to finding prime <b>gaps</b> of any <b>size.</b> By this method, we find prime gaps for all even integers from 746 to 1000, and some beyond.

40|$|Abstract – The {{periodic}} coupled wakes of two spheres, placed {{side by side}} in {{a uniform}} stream at low Reynolds numbers, are studied experimentally and by Direct Numerical Simulations. Different regimes of interaction are observed, depending on the separation distance between the spheres. For touching spheres, a single wake is found. At small <b>gap</b> <b>sizes,</b> the two wakes interact strongly, and out-of phase shedding occurs. In-phase shedding is observed experimentally for intermediate <b>gap</b> <b>sizes,</b> whereas DNS does not reveal a preferred phase difference between the two wakes. At distances above three sphere diameters, shedding is uncorrelated. Variations of the critical Reynolds number and shedding frequencies with separation distance are shown.

40|$|To {{meet the}} need for {{research}} on the requirements for corridors for marshland birds, this study set out to quantify gap crossing decisions made by reed warblers moving through the landscape. In three experiments, reed warblers were released into landscape situations with different <b>gap</b> <b>sizes</b> and their movement towards reed patches fringing a watercourse were monitored. In all experiments, most birds flew over the smallest gap towards the nearest reed patch. In the experiment with two <b>gap</b> <b>sizes,</b> the probability of crossing a gap was {{a function of the}} ratio between distances to the reed patches. In the experiment with increasing <b>gap</b> <b>sizes,</b> most birds crossed the smaller gaps frequently. Near the bigger gaps, birds did not cross the gaps; instead, they only crossed the watercourse repeatedly. In the third experiment with more realistic landscape configurations [...] the birds preferred nearby non-reed landscape elements to more distant reed patches. It is concluded that reed warblers were reluctant to cross gaps wider than 50 m. The results suggest that the presence and <b>size</b> of <b>gaps</b> in reed patches affect reed warblers' local gap-crossing decisions: when given a choice, the birds prefer to cross the smallest gap. Furthermore, reed warblers may be directed towards suitable marshlands by creating corridors of reed vegetation with gaps no wider than 50 m. The surrounding agricultural landscape and the presence of trees and ditches could decrease the reluctance to cross gaps in corridors...|$|R

40|$|A {{previous}} paper developed {{solutions for}} conductive heat {{flow in the}} x, y plane {{where there is a}} uniform flow at infinite values of y and where y = 0 represents the interface between two materials. This interface consists of an arbitrary pattern of perfectly conducting strips and non-conducting gaps. It was assumed that thermoelastic effects are negligible. The solution took the form of an equation with one unknown parameter per gap, which can be found by a simple process involving numerical integration. Using this method, the present paper gives solutions for a range of <b>gap</b> <b>sizes</b> and spacings. These are compared with approximate solutions determined by simplifying the general solutions sufficiently for them to be solved analytically. It is shown that the <b>sizes</b> of the <b>gaps</b> are the dominant parameters. The spacings are relatively unimportant unless two gaps are very close.

Therefore, the quantum confinement, inter-edge superexchange, and intra-edge direct exchange interactions in zigzag GNR are important for its magnetism and band gap. The edge magnetic moment and band gap of zigzag GNR are reversely proportional to the electron/hole concentration and they can be controlled by alkaline adatoms.|$|E
50|$|Gradients of canopy {{influence}} can {{be created}} by partial cutting, and tree growth responses within gaps of various sizes and configurations, as well as within the adjacent forest matrix can form a basis for tree species selection. Hybrid spruce (the complex of white spruce, Sitka spruce, and occasionally Engelmann spruce) {{was one of several}} coniferous species used in a study in the Moist Cold subzone of the Interior Cedar-Hemlock zone in northwestern British Columbia. A total of 109 gaps were selected from a population of openings created by logging within each light and heavy partial cutting treatment in stands averaging 30 m in canopy height; 76 gaps were less than 1000 m2, 33 were between 1000 m2 and 5000 m2. Canopy <b>gap</b> <b>size</b> was calculated as the area of an ellipse, the major axis of which was the longest line that could be run from canopy edge to canopy edge inside the gap, and the minor axis was the longest line that could be run from canopy edge perpendicular to the long line. Seedlings were planted in gaps and in the undisturbed and clearcut treatment units. There were strong and consistent trends in growth response among the seedlings as <b>gap</b> <b>size</b> increased. In all species, growth increased rapidly from small single-tree gaps to about 1000 m2, but thereafter, there was little change up to 5000 m2. Tree size and current growth rates for all species were highest in full open conditions. In large and medium gaps (300-1000 m2), the largest trees of all species occurred in the middle gap position, with little difference between the sunny north and shady south positions, lodgepole pine excepted. The light advantage expected off the north end of higher-latitude gaps was not a benefit for tree growth, suggesting that below-ground effects of canopy edge trees have an important influence of seedling growth in these forests (Coates 2000).|$|E
