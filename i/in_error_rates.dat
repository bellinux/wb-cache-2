A combination of the non-linearly transformed PLP (perceptive linear predictive coefficients), MSG (modulation filtered spectrogram) and TRAP (temporal pattern) features yields a 63 % improvement <b>in</b> <b>error</b> <b>rate</b> as compared to baseline me frequency cepstral coefficients features.

50|$|Foldi et al. used a multi-target visual {{cancellation}} task {{to examine}} visual selective attention {{in patients with}} AD compared to healthy controls. Researchers found slower performance and completion times compared to those without AD, and {{this can be seen}} as a more inefficient and severe form of the attentional processes found in normal aging. Patients with AD scored twice as long on each target or cancellation, irrespective of the type of cancellation, compared to that of the age-matched healthy controls. The control group was also found to slow their search times consistent with a speed-accuracy trade off. That is, when the similarity between targets and distractors increased, and it became more difficult to distinguish the target. However, they maintained detection accuracy with no increase <b>in</b> <b>error</b> <b>rates.</b> This finding suggests, in contrast to patients with ADâ€™s performance, that the control group slowed their search only to avoid responses to distractors, and therefore to avoid errors and demonstrate the speed-accuracy trade off. Patients with AD slowed their search as the similarity between target and distractor increased, however they still made more errors and missed targets. This performance did not demonstrate the speed-accuracy trade-off. This suggests that, in AD patients as opposed to healthy controls, the degree of similarity between search items affects the ability to selectively attend to relevant targets. Similar results were observed in Schaefer, where a study of visual selective attention in AD was conducted by varying the physical characteristics of a selective cancellation task.|$|E
5000|$|According to rapid-chase theory, both primes and targets elicit {{feedforward}} sweeps that {{traverse the}} visuomotor system {{in rapid succession}} until they reach motor areas of the brain. There, motor processes are elicited automatically and {{without the need for}} a conscious representation. Because the prime signal has a head-start over the target signal, primes and targets are engaged in a [...] "rapid chase" [...] through the visuomotor system. Because the prime signal reaches the motor cortex first, it is able to activate the motor response assigned to it. The shorter the prime-target SOA, the quicker the target can start the pursuit. When the target signal finally arrives at the motor cortex, it can continue the response process elicited by the prime (if prime and target are consistent) or redirect the response process (if prime and target are inconsistent). This explains why response priming effects increase with prime-target SOA: the longer the SOA, the more time for the prime signal to control the response on its own, and the further the response activation process can proceed {{in the direction of the}} prime. Under some circumstances, the prime can also provoke a response error (leading to the characteristic priming effects <b>in</b> <b>error</b> <b>rates).</b> Such a time-course of sequential motor control by primes and targets was described in 2003 by Dirk Vorberg and coworkers in a mathematical model and fits the time-course of primed motor potentials in the EEG.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} experiment, {{cognitive}} control under stress was investigated using a real-life paradigm, namely an evaluation flight for military student pilots. The magnitude of cognitive interference on color-word, numerical and emotional Stroop paradigms was studied during a baseline recording and {{right before the}} test flight. Cardio-respiratory parameters were simultaneously assessed during rest {{and the performance of}} the Stroop tasks. Cognitive data suggested a different speed/accuracy trade-off under stress, and no modulation of the interference effect for color words or numerical stimuli. However, we observed a major increase <b>in</b> <b>error</b> <b>rates</b> for specific emotional stimuli related to the evaluation situation in the stress condition. The increase in cognitive interference from emotional stimuli, expressed as an increase <b>in</b> <b>error</b> <b>rates,</b> was correlated to the decreased cardiac reactivity to challenge in the stress situation. This relationship is discussed in the framework of Sanders' (1983) model of stress and performance.

40|$|In {{very large}} {{vocabulary}} hypothesis-verification systems, the fine acoustic matcher {{is usually the}} most time consuming, so that the main concern is reducing the preselection list length as much as possible. Traditionally, these systems use a too high fixed preselection list length, increasing computational demands over the really needed. The idea we are proposing is estimating a different preselection list length for every utterance, {{so that we can}} lower the average computational effort needed for the recognition process. As we will show, itâ€™s even possible that the resulting system outperforms the fixed length one <b>in</b> <b>error</b> <b>rate,</b> even when reducing computational cost.

40|$|International audienceDespite {{years of}} speech {{recognition}} research, {{little is known}} about which words tend to be misrecognized and why. Previous work has shown that errors increase for infrequent words, short words, and very loud or fast speech, but many other presumed causes of error (e. g., nearby disfluencies, turn-initial words, phonetic neighborhood density) have never been carefully tested. The reasons for the huge differences found <b>in</b> <b>error</b> <b>rates</b> between speakers also remain largely mysterious. Using a mixed-effects regression model, we investigate these and other factors by analyzing the errors of two state-of-the-art recognizers on conversational speech. Words with higher error rates include those with extreme prosodic characteristics, those occurring turn-initially or as discourse markers, and : acoustically similar words that also have similar language model probabilities. Words preceding disfluent interruption points (first repetition tokens and words before fragments) also have higher error rates. Finally, even after accounting for other factors, speaker differences cause enormous variance <b>in</b> <b>error</b> <b>rates,</b> suggesting that speaker error rate variance is not fully explained by differences in word choice, fluency, or prosodic characteristics. We also propose that doubly confusable pairs, rather than high neighborhood density, may better explain phonetic neighborhood errors in human speech processing...|$|E

40|$|At {{the outset}} we should {{emphasize}} that nothing in Hayward and Tarrâ€™s commentary {{speaks to the}} main results of the Biederman and Bar (1999) report: Slight costs of rotation in detecting geon differences when matching a sequential pair of novel objects (3. 3 % in-crease <b>in</b> <b>error</b> <b>rates),</b> but massive costs (46. 2 % increase <b>in</b> <b>error</b> <b>rates)</b> in the detection of metric differences. Their comments are all addressed to our {{review of the literature}} of the relatively small costs (versus zero costs) that have been observed when geon differences were, presumably, available.

It is not completely clear why the origin of these relatively small rotation costs are an important theoret-ical issue to Hayward and Tarr insofar as they have now â€˜eschewed â€™ mental rotation mechanisms (their note 2). Instead, viewpoint costs are now regarded by these authors as reflecting changes in information and that â€˜there is no directly causal relation between the magni-tude of a change in viewpoint of an object, and the magnitude of the associated cost in recognition â€™ (note 2).
