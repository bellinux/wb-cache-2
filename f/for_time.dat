5|$|In early July 1877, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B) {{announced}} it would reduce the wages of all workers by ten percent. One hundred miles would constitute a day's work, and crews would not receive allowances <b>for</b> <b>time</b> spent on delays at stations. Various meetings of railroad employees followed, and a committee was formed to meet with officers of the railroad. They appealed to the vice president, Mr. King, but he declined to meet.|$|E

Furthermore, studies accounting <b>for</b> <b>time</b> trend reflecting general cohesion policies in Europe that started before, and continue after implementing the common currency find no effect on trade. These results suggest that other policies aimed at European integration might be the source of observed increase in trade.|$|E
