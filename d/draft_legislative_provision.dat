40|$|Privilege is an evidential {{principle}} which, on {{the grounds}} of public policy, excludes evidence relevant and otherwise admissible. This thesis aims to discover whether privilege should be applied to the psychotherapeutic profession in South Africa. At present, the only profession in South Africa afforded privilege is the legal profession. There are two main theoretical justifications for privilege: the utilitarian and the individual/human rights approach. This thesis considers whether the psychotherapeutic profession wan-ants privilege under either theory, and recommends that the law of privilege integrate both theories rather than adopt one or the other. The impact of the Constitution and the right to privacy receive particular attention. Very little literature or case law on the question of psychotherapeutic privilege was found in South Africa. Consequently, extensive comparative research into the common-law systems of England, Canada and United States of America was done. This research yielded some interesting findings. The first is that case-by-case development of the law of privilege is uncel 1 ain and fragmented. The next is that psychotherapeutic privilege exists in almost absolute form in the United States of America, but is littered with lacunae causing as much uncertainty as the case-by-case approach to privilege law. The most helpful method of dealing with the problem was found in Canada, where a two-stage approach to protecting personal information, including psychotherapeutic records, has been developed. In light of this research, this thesis reassesses the original viability of psychotherapeutic privilege in South Africa. Privilege, it was found, is not the best solution to protecting psychotherapeutic communications. This thesis recommends legislative adoption of an amended two-stage approach based on the Canadian model for sexual offence trials as the best method of protecting psychotherapeutic communications in both civil and criminal proceedings. The thesis ends by suggesting <b>draft</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>provisions...</b>|$|R
40|$|This Guide {{is written}} as {{a sequel to}} the 2007 UN Environment Programme Handbook for Legal Draftsmen on Environmentally Sound Management of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Resources. This Guide, as the Handbook, is written in {{response}} to needs expressed, particularly by energy efficiency and renewable energy project initiators, government officials, energy managers, project developers and particularly developing country energy legal draftsmen, asking for assistance in <b>drafting</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>provisions</b> for promotion and implementation of sound energy efficiency and renewable energy programs. The Guide describes the key legal issues associated with efficiency and renewable energy resource development, and presents legislative options from both developed and developing countries for dealing with them, including sample excerpts from legislation. A new section is included describing available mechanisms for financing energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. Another section has been added providing case studies analysing the laws {{of a variety of}} countries, namely from Colombia, the Philippines, Pakistan, South Africa, Ghana and Korea. The Guide is designed to be user-friendly. Accordingly, it has been written as a stand-alone document, not requiring back and forth reference between the Guide and the Handbook. As was stated in the Handbook, “the focus here is on national legislation, but encompasses national constitutional provisions, regulations and state and local laws where they are the key determinants of the promotion of efficiency and renewable resources. Emphasis is placed on adaptation to local country needs and conditions. ” The Guide is divided into seven sections. Section One, Issues of General Application, contains legislative information on issues pertinent to all energy efficiency and renewable energy applications. Section Two, Energy Options, describes the choices to made evaluating energy efficiency and renewable energy {{in the context of the}} other available energy resources. Section Three, Project Financing, describes a range of financing methods and resources that have been used successfully...|$|R
40|$|Ecologically {{sustainable}} development {{has become a}} major feature of legal systems at the international, national and local levels throughout the world. In Australia, governments have responded to environmental crises by enacting legislation imposing obligations and restrictions over privately-owned land. Whilst these obligations and restrictions may well be necessary to achieve sustainability, the approach to management of information concerning these instruments is problematic. For example, management of information concerning obligations and restrictions in Queensland is fragmented, with some instruments registered or recorded on the land title register, some on external registers, and some information only available in the legislation itself. This approach is used in most Australian jurisdictions. This fragmented approach has led to two separate but interconnected problems. First, the Torrens system is no longer meeting its goal of providing a complete and accurate picture of title. Second, this uncoordinated approach to the management of land titles, and obligations and restrictions on land use, has created a barrier to sustainable management of natural resources. This is because compliance with environmental laws is impaired in the absence of easily accessible and accurate information. These problems demonstrate a clear need for reform in this area. To determine how information concerning these obligations and restrictions may be most effectively managed, this thesis will apply a comparative methodology and consider three case studies, which each utilise different models for management of this information. These jurisdictions will be assessed according to a set of guidelines for comparison to identify which features of their systems provide for effective management of information concerning obligations and restrictions on title and use. Based on this comparison, this thesis will devise a series of recommendations for an effective system for the management of information concerning obligations and restrictions on land title and use, taking into account any potential legal issues and barriers to implementation. This series of recommendations for reform will be supplemented by suggested <b>draft</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>provisions...</b>|$|R

40|$|The central {{objective}} {{in this thesis}} is to explore the gaps between the normative justifications advanced for language rights and language legislative protection and the effective realisation of those rights and <b>legislative</b> <b>provisions</b> in practice. This objective is achieved by examining the scope and application of language rights and <b>legislative</b> <b>provisions</b> within language legislation in Ireland and the United Kingdom. Drawing on Canadian jurisprudence advocating for language rights to be recognised as “purposeful”, the thesis considers {{the extent to which}} Ireland and the United Kingdom have limited the acceptance of positive obligations as they relate to the provision of language services in the public sphere. In arguing that language rights are distinct in nature, the thesis suggests that in order for language rights to be effectively realised, an approach to language rights and language legislation more generally must be underpinned by a substantive vision of equality, otherwise language rights and <b>legislative</b> <b>provisions</b> merely amount to symbolic recognition and vacuous rhetoric as opposed to being substantive and enabling rights and provisions. Having said that, the thesis also recognises and elucidates the practical difficulties that arise in the realisation of language rights and language <b>legislative</b> <b>provisions</b> and in doing so seeks to stimulate further dialogue about the nature and limits of language rights and language legislation...|$|R

The vast majority of military officers write legislation using academic writing skills developed at military and civilian universities. However, academic writing skills do not enable officers to write legislative acts efficiently. Using theories of learning and teaching, the thesis examines the reasons why an academic writing style, everyday military writing, and general writing are inappropriate for preparing officers to write legislation. It identifies the similarities and differences between academic and legislative writing to reveal the skills necessary for both. It then investigates if academic and everyday writing and reading can produce the knowledge required for <b>legislative</b> <b>drafting.</b> Concluding that they cannot, it then explores how multiple environments favor or impede officers in developing <b>legislative</b> <b>drafting</b> skills. It concludes that audience, academic norms, and other environments diminish legislative writing skills.

Introduction [...] Methodology [...] Was the {{enactment}} of the CGT regime actuated by a perception that it will satisfy the policy objective of horizontal equity? [...] Is the perception that the CGT regime will satisfy the policy objective of horizontal equity a perception that is largely correct? [...] What reasons could (in theory) cause the CGT regime to produce outcomes that fail to satisfy horizontal equity? [...] What reasons in practice cause the CGT regime to produce outcomes that violate horizontal equity? [...] Is there reasons to expect outcomes that violate horizontal equity (caused by the CGT regime) to be widespread? [...] Overall conclusions, policy implications of them, and delimitations of the research. The research problem addressed in this thesis is: Does the Australian regime of income tax on capital gains cause widespread violation of horizontal equity? The conclusion drawn in this thesis is that there is reason to expect that the Australian regime of income tax on capital gains ("the CGT regime") can cause widespread violation of horizontal equity. That conclusion is reached by seeking answers to five questions: Question 1. Was {{the enactment}} of the CGT regime, and the continuance of it after enactment, actuated by a perception (of respectively the government which enacted it, and subsequent governments which yielded to its continuance) that the regime will satisfy the policy objective of horizontal equity?, and, if it was, Question 2. Is that perception largely correct?, and, if it is, Question 3. What reasons could (in theory) cause the CGT regime to produce outcomes that fail to satisfy horizontal equity (that is, outcomes that violate horizontal equity) ?, and, if such reasons exist, Question 4. Do those reasons (or any other) in practice cause the CGT regime to produce outcomes that violate horizontal equity?, and, if they do, Question 5. Is there reason to expect those outcomes to be widespread? [...] This thesis argues that only any one of four reasons can (in theory) cause the CGT regime to potentially produce outcomes that violate horizontal equity. Those four reasons (designated as respectively Reason A, Reason B, Reason C and Reason D) are: Reason A. The best interpretation (pursuant to the current approach of the Australian judiciary) of relevant <b>legislative</b> <b>provisions</b> can result in outcomes that violate horizontal equity. Reason B. Though the best interpretation (pursuant to the current approach of the Australian judiciary) of relevant <b>legislative</b> <b>provisions</b> does not result in outcomes that violate horizontal equity, the Australian judiciary's interpretation of those <b>legislative</b> <b>provisions,</b> not being compatible with the best interpretation of those <b>legislative</b> <b>provisions</b> (pursuant to the current approach of the Australian judiciary), can result in outcomes that violate horizontal equity. Reason C. Though the best interpretation (pursuant to the current approach of the Australian judiciary) of relevant <b>legislative</b> <b>provisions</b> does not result in outcomes that violate horizontal equity, the Commissioner's interpretation of those <b>legislative</b> <b>provisions</b> (generally, as evinced in rulings) can result in outcomes that violate horizontal equity. That would occur where the Commissioner's interpretation of relevant <b>legislative</b> <b>provisions</b> is not compatible with their best interpretation (pursuant to the current approach of the Australian judiciary). Reason D. Though the Australian judiciary's interpretation of relevant <b>legislative</b> <b>provisions</b> (despite not being the best interpretation of those <b>legislative</b> <b>provisions,</b> based on the current approach of the Australian judiciary) does not result in outcomes that violate horizontal equity, the Commissioner's interpretation of those <b>legislative</b> <b>provisions</b> (generally, as evinced in rulings) can result in outcomes that violate horizontal equity. That would occur where the Commissioner's interpretation of relevant <b>legislative</b> <b>provisions</b> is not compatible with their interpretation by the Australian judiciary (albeit, based on the current approach of the Australian judiciary, such interpretation of the Australian judiciary not being compatible with the best interpretation of those <b>legislative</b> <b>provisions).</b> [...] In the arrangements pursuant to which <b>legislative</b> <b>provisions</b> imposing CGT are enacted and implemented, there is an absence of systematic sensitivity to those four reasons. In those arrangements, there is also an absence of institutionalised processes (mandated by legislation or otherwise) for the identification of outcomes that violate horizontal equity, and effecting legislative amendments to prevent such outcomes. Due to those absences, in this thesis, the conclusion is reached that there is reason to expect outcomes from the detailed working of the CGT regime that violate horizontal equity to be widespread. [...] Those four reasons can be effectively addressed through: a consequentialist approach to interpreting <b>legislative</b> <b>provisions</b> imposing CGT, buttressed by legislative directives to the Australian judiciary and other means necessary for making such an approach practicable; post-implementation reviews of CGT measures enacted to ensure that those measures do not cause violation of horizontal equity; and enacting explicit legislative directives essentially precluding the Commissioner from issuing rulings (or any like pronouncements) which are inconsistent with judicial authority. [...] A status quo where there is reason to expect widespread violation of horizontal equity caused by the CGT regime may be perpetuated if those four reasons are not addressed. Such an outcome will retard sound tax administration because the public's willingness to optimally comply with a tax will not be fostered unless the public views that tax as one which satisfies horizontal equity. An absence of optimal compliance will make a tax inefficacious. The CGT may become a tax relegated to such a status if those four reasons are not addressed. Mode of access: World Wide Web. 293...|$|R
