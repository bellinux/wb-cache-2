40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a set of}} methods for estimating the renewable energy generation downstream of a measurement device using real-world measurements. First, we present a generation disaggregation scheme where the only information available for estimation is the micro-synchrophasor measurements obtained at the substation or <b>feeder</b> <b>head.</b> We then propose two strategies in which we use measurements from the substation {{as well as a}} proxy solar irradiance measurement. Using these two measurement points, we first propose a multiple linear regression strategy, in which we estimate a relationship between the measured reactive power and the load active power consumption, which are then used in disaggregation. Finally, we expand this strategy to strategically manage the reconstruction errors in the estimators. We simultaneously disaggregate the solar generation and load. We show {{that it is possible to}} disaggragate the generation of a 7. 5 megawatt photovoltaic site with a root-mean-squared error of approximately 450 kilowatts.

40|$|The NASA Langley Research Center fiber {{placement}} {{facility has}} proven to be a valuable asset for obtaining data, experience, and insights into the automated fabrication of high performance composites. The facility consists of two automated devices: an Asea Brown Boveri (ABB) robotic arm with a modified heated head capable of hot gas and focused infrared heating and a 7 ' x 17 ' gantry containing a <b>feeder</b> <b>head,</b> rotating platform, focused infrared lamp and e-beam gun. While uncured thermoset tow and tape, e. g., epoxy and cyanate prepreg, can be placed with a robot, the placement facility s most powerful attribute is the ability to place thermoplastic and e-beam curable material to net shape. In recent years, ribbonizing techniques have been developed to make high quality thermoplastic and thermoset dry material forms to the standards required for robotic placement. A variety of composites have been fabricated from these ribbons by heated head tow and tape placement including both flat plates and cylinders. Composite mechanical property values of the former were between 85 and 100 percent of those obtained by hand lay-up/autoclave processing...|$|E
50|$|When steel solidifies in a mould, uneven cooling {{causes a}} central cavity or 'pipe' {{to form in}} the casting. In 1861 Mushet invented the 'Dozzle'; a clay cone or sleeve, heated white hot and {{inserted}} {{into the top of}} the ingot mould {{near the end of the}} pour, and then filled with molten steel. Its purpose was to maintain a reservoir of molten steel, which drained down and filled the pipe as the casting cooled. Mushet claimed this, and other small inventions of his, saved the steelmakers of Sheffield 'many millions of pounds' (in 19th century money), yet he received neither payment nor recognition for these inventions. Dozzles, now called hot tops or <b>feeder</b> <b>heads,</b> are still in use today.|$|R

50|$|In Texas, {{hundreds}} of <b>feeder</b> trails <b>headed</b> north {{to one of}} the main cattle trails. In the early 1840s, most cattle were driven up the Shawnee Trail. The Chisholm Trail was previously used by Indian hunting and raiding parties; the trail crossed into Indian Territory (present-day west-central Oklahoma) near Red River Station (in present-day Montague County, Texas) and entered Kansas near Caldwell. Through Oklahoma, the Chisholm Trail generally follows the route of US Highway 81 through present-day towns of El Reno, Duncan, and Enid.|$|R
40|$|Continuity of the {{electric}} supply {{is considered one of}} the main power quality indices, and thus, it is essential to perform fast and efficient restoration of electricity following outages. How-ever, this might not be always an easy task, especially in large distribution networks. In this paper, an efficient multi-agent based control scheme is introduced to restore the maximum possible out of service loads without violating any of the tech-nical constraints of {{the electric}} network. The proposed scheme utilizes a number of agents distributed along the feeder to gather the necessary information and communicate it to the decision making agent at the faulted <b>feeder</b> <b>head.</b> The decision making agent first attempts to restore all the out of service loads through group restoration. However, if this is not pos-sible due to violating any of the technical constrains, then the agent attempts to restore as much loads as possible through a zone restoration process. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme, two case studies are presented to show the group and zone restorations. The distribution sys-tem is simulated in the MATLAB environment to perform the required power flow calculations and provide the necessary information to the agents. On the other hand, the agents are implemented in JADE environment where the communication and decision making process occurs...|$|E
40|$|After a heat treatment, {{spheroidal}} graphite (SG) irons offer an efficient compromise between density and mechanical properties. Therefore, these SG irons, also called austempered ductile iron (ADI), {{are intended to}} substitute forged steels for the weight reduction of engine parts. Indeed, they combine strength, fracture toughness and high resistance to abrasive wear at low cost. To save time and energy, ADI components have to be manufactured by a combined casting and forging process followed by a specific heat treatment called austempering. Through this, they compete with forged steel parts. The manufacture of an automotive connecting rod needs to perform the removal of risers and <b>feeder</b> <b>head</b> at 1000 °C just after the casting operation (Meena and El Mansori, 2011). However, this step can cause several surface degradations which jeopardize the forged component viability (Fouilland and El Mansori, 2012). A multiscale analysis is proposed to evaluate the sensitive parameters for the hot cutting process. A global approach consists in experiments on an orthogonal cutting test bench allowing to reproduce the actual stress state observed during the hot cutting process. Several tests are performed with different cutting speeds and observed cut surfaces are discussed. This orthogonal cutting test is modelled with the Abaqus software. Rheological behaviour of SG iron is then determined using Gleeble 3500 system versus temperatures and strain rates. This rheological law is finally implemented in the numerical model which enables to get thermo-mechanical conditions (temperatures, strain rate and plastic deformation) in the primary shear zone. This local approach is a contribution to explain the surface degradation phenomena during hot cutting process on SG iron...|$|E

5000|$|The spiders are {{notable for}} the often large and {{intricate}} webs which they weave at night. They are usually nocturnal <b>feeders,</b> resting <b>head</b> {{down in their}} webs waiting to catch flying insects. They make their sticky rounded orb webs near lights and between trees where insects are likely to fly. During the day the spider will often rest somewhere near the web, usually under a leaf or twig, or in a crevice in bark or rock. They are commonly found around human habitation so may be found resting under eaves and in similar places. When disturbed they will retreat towards this rest area, although under imminent danger the spider will drop {{to the ground and}} [...] "play dead". Occasionally individual spiders will remain on the web during the day, possibly when prey has not been caught for a while, but this makes them more vulnerable to predation by birds.|$|R
50|$|With the {{increasing}} traffic, more water was needed, and the ponds on Hirwaun Common, which were {{owned by the}} Tappendens, were converted into a reservoir, covering 47 acre, from which water was supplied to the canal via the Afon Cynon and the <b>feeder</b> at Canal <b>Head.</b> In 1845, the company decided to build a pumping engine at Tyr Founder, to supply water from the Afon Cynon to the canal just above Cwmbach lock.

Two and three dimensional models were utilized to characterize water velocities and flow patterns. Simulated river flows ranged from 85 m 3 /s to 850 m 3 /s. Velocities within and downstream of the proposed notch were high (» 6 m/s) and unsuitable for passage. Addition of labyrinth weirs and side slots reduced velocities to below 3. 65 m/s, provided adequate depth for swimming, enhanced attraction flow and maintained positive flow throughout the design...|$|R

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{reported}} relationship between eating behavior and performance in feedlot cattle. The evaluation of behavior traits demands high degree of work and trained manpower, therefore, {{in recent years has}} been used an automated feed intake measurement system (GrowSafe System ®), that identify and record individual feeding patterns. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between feeding behavior traits and average daily gain in Nellore calves undergoing feed efficiency test. Date from 85 Nelore males was recorded during the feed efficiency test performed in 2012, at Centro APTA Bovinos de Corte, Instituto de Zootecnia, São Paulo State. Were analyzed the behavioral traits: time at <b>feeder</b> (TF), <b>head</b> down duration (HD), representing the time when the animal is actually eating, frequency of visits (FV) and feed rate (FR) calculated as the amount of dry matter (DM) consumed by time at feeder (g. min - 1). The ADG was calculated by linear regression of individual weights on days in test. ADG classes were obtained considering the average ADG and standard deviation (SD) being: high ADG (>mean + 1. 0 SD), medium ADG (± 1. 0 SD from the mean) and low ADG ( 0. 05) among ADG classes for FV, indicating that these traits are not related to each other. These results shows that the ADG is related to the agility in eat food and not to the time spent in the bunk or to the number of visits in a range of 24 hours...|$|R
40|$|Eye {{and head}} {{movements}} are coordinated during head-free pursuit. To examine whether pursuit neurons in frontal eye fields (FEF) carry gaze-pursuit commands that drive both eye-pursuit and head-pursuit, monkeys whose heads {{were free to}} rotate about a vertical axis were trained to pursue a juice <b>feeder</b> with their <b>head</b> and a target with their eyes. Initially the feeder and target moved synchronously with the same visual angle. FEF neurons responding to this gaze-pursuit were tested for eye-pursuit of target motion while the feeder was stationary and for head-pursuit while the target was stationary. The majority of pursuit neurons exhibited modulation during head-pursuit, but their preferred directions during eye-pursuit and head-pursuit were different. Although peak modulation occurred during head movements, the onset of discharge usually was not aligned with the head movement onset. The minority of neurons whose discharge onset was so aligned discharged after the head movement onset. These results {{do not support the}} idea that the head-pursuit [...] related modulation reflects head-pursuit commands. Furthermore, modulation similar to that during head-pursuit was obtained by passive head rotation on stationary trunk. Our results suggest that FEF pursuit neurons issue gaze or eye movement commands during gaze-pursuit and that the head-pursuit [...] related modulation primarily reflects reafferent sig-nals resulting from head movements...|$|R
5000|$|Like other lugworms, A. pacifica lives {{under the}} sand in a [...] "J" [...] shaped burrow with its {{head at the}} bottom and its tail near the surface. It is a deposit <b>feeder</b> and the <b>head</b> is {{constantly}} swallowing muddy sand. This creates a shallow depression on the surface. The cleaner sand, with nutrients removed, is expelled through the posterior end of the worm and ends up as a neat pile of coiled sand on the surface. Bacteria and microfauna may colonise the worm's gut and enrich the faecal casts. Some beaches may have fifty to a hundred lugworms per square metre and the sand is consequently being perpetually recycled by the worms. The lugworm maintains a constant stream of water through the burrow by the alternate contraction and dilatation of its body segments. Gas exchange is facilitated by the bushy tufts of gills which project from its middle region and which continually turn and flex. These adaptations to life under the sediment provide protection for the worm from desiccation and predation while providing a plentiful supply of food and oxygen. At low tide, when the sediment in which the lugworm is living is no longer covered by water, aerial respiration takes place.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the expanse}} of the salt lakes of the Lake Eyre basin lives a species of ant of the genus Melophorus (as yet unnamed), both {{on the edges of}} the salt-pan and on the salt-pan itself. Most of the foragers are small (~ 3. 0 - 5. 0 mm), but ~ 10 % of the ants seen {{foraging}} are much larger (~ 7. 0 mm) and may form a soldier caste. Foragers are thermophilic and show diurnal activity, displaying a single-peaked activity profile across the day, with activity time limited to 2 - 6 h at most each day (during the late-summer study period, 28 February to 28 March 2012). They forage largely for dead arthropods, but also occasionally bring home plant materials. Foraging success (not considering possible liquid food intake) is ~ 20 %, resembling the success rate of their congener Melophorus bagoti, which inhabits cluttered environments. When displaced with food from a <b>feeder,</b> the ants <b>head</b> systematically and precisely in the feeder-to-nest direction, thus exhibiting path integration abilities involving celestial compass cues. The study of this species provides an interesting comparative perspective in contrasting desert ants of the same genus and thus genetic heritage inhabiting habitats differing in complexity of panoramic terrestrial cues as well as comparing ecologically similar species inhabiting the same type of habitat (in the present case, salt-pans) but differing in their phylogenetic relationships. 9 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Understanding of {{relationships}} between morphology and ecological performance can help to reveal how natural selection drives biological diversification. We investigate relationships between feeding behavior, foraging performance and morphology within {{a diverse group of}} teleost fishes, and examine the extent to which associations can be explained by evolutionary relatedness. Morphological adaptation associated with sediment sifting was examined using a phylogenetic linear discriminant analysis on a set of ecomorphological traits from 27 species of Neotropical cichlids. For most sifting taxa, feeding behavior could be effectively predicted by a linear discriminant function of ecomorphology across multiple clades of sediment sifters, and this pattern could not be explained by shared evolutionary history alone. Additionally, we tested foraging efficiency in seven Neotropical cichlid species, five of which are specialized benthic <b>feeders</b> with differing <b>head</b> morphology. Efficiency was evaluated based on the degree to which invertebrate prey could be retrieved at different depths of sediment. Feeding performance was compared both with respect to feeding mode and species using a phylogenetic ANCOVA, with substrate depth as a covariate. Benthic foraging performance was constant across sediment depths in non-sifters but declined with depth in sifters. The non-sifting Hypsophrys used sweeping motions of the body and fins to excavate large pits to uncover prey; this tactic was more efficient for consuming deeply buried invertebrates than observed among sediment sifters. Findings indicate that similar feeding performance among sediment-sifting cichlid...|$|R
