The length and width is obtained using a superresolution procedure. An interferometric phase estimation, based on ESPRIT principle, is {{applied for the}} retrieval of the <b>heigth</b> of different media and specifically for the <b>heigth</b> of the buildings.

40|$|Recently, it {{has been}} shown that while {{asperity}} models show correctly qualitative features of rough contact problems (linearity in area-load, negative exponential dependence of load on separation which means also linearity of stiffness with load), the exact value of the coefficients are not precise for the idealized case of Gaussian distribution of <b>heigths.</b> This is due to the intrinsic simplifications, neglecting asperity coalescence and interaction effects. However, the issue of Gaussianity has not been proved or experimentally verified in many cases, and here we show that, for example, assuming a Weibull distribution of asperity <b>heigths,</b> the area-load linear coefficient is not much affected, while the relationships load-separation and therefore also stiffness-load do change largely, particularly when considering bounded distributions of asperity <b>heigths.</b> It is suggested that Gaussianity of surfaces should be further tested in experiments, before applying the most sophisticated rough contact models based on the Gaussian assumption.

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we propose}} a general model to {{simulate}} one or several waves in open sea {{and near the}} shore. The model {{is based on the}} linear form of the Navier-Stokes equations. Each water particle revolves around a circle in open sea and around an ellipsis near the coast with the great axis that becomes parallel to the sea bed slope on the shore. We obtain an extreme sea response when we study a unique wave characteristic of the swell. But, the frame rates decreases when the waves number increases. Thereby, we decide to compute the waves sum by an inverse Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Instead of the well-known statistical model of Jerry Tessendorf, the pioneer of water synthesis images in the film Titanic, we apply our general waves model. By this way, the sea depth and the tidal current change the waves <b>heigths</b> and water particles revolve on a circle or an ellipsis.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that in the {{scattered}} radiation, generated by an ultrashort laser pulse impinging on a metal nano-layer, non-oscillatory wake-fields appear with a definite sign. The magnitude of these wake-fields is proportional with the incoming field strength, and a sign of them is governed by the cosine of the carrier-envelope phase difference of the incoming pulse. At relativistic laser intensities the target is considered as a plasma layer in vacuum, produced from a thin foil by a pre-pulse, which is followed by the main high-intensity laser pulse. The nonlinearities stemming from the relativistic kinematics of the surface current density (representing the plasma electrons) lead to the appearance of higher-harmonics in the scattered spectra. In general, the harmonic peaks are down-shited due to the presence of an intensity-dependent factor. Certain regions of these spectra are very sensitive to the variation of the carrier-envelope phase difference. The spectra has a long tail where the <b>heigths</b> of the peaks vary practically within one order of magnitude forming a quasi-continuum. By Fourier synthetising the components from this plateau region attosecond pulses have been obtained. Comment: 18 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

To compute the RES, all components which store energy during the day were considered: litter, minor components (palm trees and lianas), stem, branches, twigs, leaves and air. To obtain the RES of the stems, three methods were used. The first one uses all stem temperature measurements. The other ones, {{which are based on}} an analytical solution of the heat conduction equation, depend only on the temperature measurements in one radial depth of a tree with the average characteristics of the complete set. The RES of the other components was determined with the air and the average tree stem surface temperature measurements, plus the air moisture. One third of the RES of the forest is due to the stems, while other third is due to the air; finally, the last one is divided among the other parts.

[1, 2]. Also, the inductance of long on-chip wires {{can no longer be}} ignored when switching frequencies are over several GHz. The speed of transistors in modern ICs increases substantially with every improving generation; however the raw, unbuffered speed of the electrical interconnect wiring is reaching a plateau, limited by material, electrical and geometry constraints. The intrinsic RC time constant of electrical wires stays approximately constant throughout process scaling; the l 2 dependence of the interconnect delay onthelength, l,oftheconnection does not go away for chips with smaller feature sizes. In fact, since today’s chips are becoming more complex, the average interconnect distance is actually increasing. While pipelining may seem like a simple solution to this problem, the latency penalty simply cannot be tolerated for some critical signals. As minimum wire widths and pitches decrease in moreadvancedtechnologies, wire <b>heigths</b> are increased to provide lower parasitic resistance, to increase current capacity and to reduce delays. However, this steep wire aspect ratio translates into greater mutual capacitance coupling between adjacent wires, increasing crosstalk noise.

40|$|Echographic and sedimentological {{investigations}} were undertaken on {{the shelf}} of Cagliari {{with the purpose of}} underlining the relationships between modern terrigenous and bioclastic sediments and the behaviour of the sedimentary system during the Holocene eustatic rising. The Gulf of Cagliari is a sub-tropical, semi-arid Mediterranean area located {{in the southern part of}} the NW striking Oligo- Miocene Sardinian Rift, within which the Pliocene Campidano Graben is superimposed. The Quaternary continental shelf developed transversally to this tectonic trough, being fed by terrigenous sediments derived from the Palaeozoic metamorphic basement and from Tertiary sedimentary and volcanic rocks. The new echographic survey, consisting of 11 lines performed transversally from the coast to the shelfbreak, integrated previously available data and allowed us to divide the shelf into different sedimentary environments. From shore to shelfbreak we first encounter a shoreface, gently sloped and distally seagrass-covered (close to the fair-weather wave base), which ends in a wide trough parallel to the coast. Toward the open shelf is a relief, site of the Posidonia oceanica main bank, reaching a minimum depth of 13 meters under the sea level, followed by its external slope. At a depth of about 30 meters the vegetation becomes rare, as less luminosity limits the growth of Posidonia, and starting from depths of 35 ÷ 40 meters a large belt of sand waves appears, with gradually decreasing <b>heigths</b> and increasing frequencies basinward. At the depth of 50 m a flat bottom prevails, followed by several reliefs stretching roughly NE–SW at 55 m depth, interpreted as submerged shore lines. Externally to such structures a narrow outer shelf occurs and the shelf break is observed at a depth of 115 ÷ 125 m. Sampling sites were located along the echographic lines and on the foreshore; 98 samples were taken with a 2 dm_ grab-sampler. Compositional and grain size analysis allowed us to identify 8 groups of facies related to present day depositional environments. Shoreface sediments are represented by almost completely terrigenous coarse to medium sands in the eastern sector, and finer mixed terrigenous-bioclastic sands on the S. Gilla shoreface. Two distinct groups of lithic facies are present near Capo S. Elia and near P. ta Zavorra, due to sediment dispersal from the limestone and andesite outcrops along the cliffed coast. The western inner-shelf depression is characterized by mixed quartzose-bioclastic sandy muds with bivalves. Mixed facies of relict terrigenous sediments and present day biogenic production (mollusks, bryozoans, red algae, echinoids and foraminifers) are on the Posidonia oceanica bank’s fore slope, where the siliciclastic component is found between - 30 and - 50 meters with decreasing importance seaward. Through the sand-wave belt a transition is observed to bioclastic, poorly sorted gravely sands of red algae and foraminifers. Here the sediment is completely bioclastic with rare breakthroughs of mixed sediments in proximity to the – 55 m paleo-shores. From a depth of 75 meters, sediments are represented by fine bioclastic-quartzose sands with bivalves and foraminifers. A peculiar feature of this shelf is the depression in the inner shelf that can be interpreted as the product of paleo-river erosions produced during the “Würmian” low stand (MIS 4 - 2), associated with terrigenous inputs insufficient to fill up the available space during the post-glacial sea level rise. Towards the middle shelf the trough is bounded by paleo-reliefs where the Posidonia bank at present overgrows, weakly aggrading and prograding. The depositional facies described document the present day sedimentary system as of a temperate water mixed terrigenous-carbonate shelf. The sedimentation is highly siliciclastic in the inner shelf from fluvial-continental feeding, and bioclastic in the rest of the shelf with a maximum productivity along the intermediate shelf’s Posidonia bank and its foreslope. In the middle and outer shelf the siliciclastic component is related to previous eustatic phases and attributable to continental and nearshore deposits lying underneath the middle-shelf Posidonia bank. Analogous depositional contexts must be attributed to the preceding high stand phases of the Middle-Upper Pleistocene. Otherwise, during glacio-eustatic phases of falling, low-stand and rising sea level, the shelf has been affected by terrigenous continental sedimentation or shoreface sequences that are currently resedimented in the middle and outer shelf. In summary, the depositional model of this shelf is characterised by alternating phases of terrigenous-carbonate sedimentation of middle latitude, with a poorly rainy, warm Mediterranean climate during highstanding sea-level conditions, and terrigenous phases during low stands with rather rainy, cooler Mediterranean climate...|$|R
40|$|An {{acoustic}} and sedimentological {{survey was}} performed on the shelf of Cagliari, Southern Sardinia, to describe morphology, modern sediments and depositional processes of the shelf from the last post glacial sea level rise. The Gulf of Cagliari is a sub-tropical, semi-arid Mediterranean area located {{in the southern part of}} the NW striking Oligo-Miocene Sardinian Rift, over which the Pliocenic Campidano Graben is superimposed. The Quaternary continental shelf developed transversally to this tectonic trough, fed by terrigenous sediments derived from the Palaeozoic metamorphic basement and from Tertiary sedimentary and volcanic rocks. The paleo-morphology influenced the depositional processes and the modern configuration of depositional environments. The shelf is at present characterized by a structural relief in the intermediate shelf, overgrown by a bioclastic bank that shelters the inner sector and can be considered similar in function to a tropical carbonate barrier. The echographic survey, consisting of 20 lines performed transversally to the coast, integrated previous acoustic and seismic data (lines and mosaic SSS, lines SBP and Sparker) and allowed, together with sedimentary data, to identify several morphological/sedimentological features. From the shore to the shelfbreak a suite of environments was detected, each characterized by distinct sedimentation and processes. The shoreface, weakly sloped and distally seagrass-covered, that ends in a wide depression (10 x 2 Km) roughly parallel to the coast. A relief in the middle shelf, overgrown by the Posidonia oceanica main bank, reaching a minimum depth of 13 meters under the sea level. A middle shelf slope (depth > 30 m) where a transition is observed to bare bottoms, (light limit for the growth of Posidonia). A large sand wave belt, from depths of 35 ÷ 40 meters, with gradually decreasing <b>heigths</b> and increasing frequencies seaward. Flat bottoms at the depth of 55 m, for the reaching of the Storm Wave Base (SWB) and vanishing of the structures. Several reliefs, stretching roughly NE–SW at 55 m depth, interpreted as submerged paleo-shorelines. Finally, a narrow outer-shelf, externally to these structures, and the shelfbrake at a depth of 115 ÷ 125 m. Sampling sites were positioned to the aid of the echographic dataset and 201 samples were taken with a 5 dm³ grab-sampler. Compositional and grain size analysis allowed to identify 9 groups of facies related to present day depositional environments. Shoreface sediments are represented by almost completely terrigenous, coarse to medium sands in the eastern sector, and finer mixed terrigenous-bioclastic sands on the western shoreface (see figure). Two groups of lithic facies are present near distinct outcrops of limestone and andesite along the cliffed coast. The inner-shelf below the fair-weather wave base is characterized by mixed quartzose-bioclastic sandy muds with bivalves while the depression is filled by a 40 m thick Holocenic sequence of organic-carbonate mud and fine sands (grey on the map). Mixed facies of relict shoreface terrigenous sediments along with a present-day biogenic component (mollusks, bryozoans, red algae, echinoids and foraminifers) are found in the Posidonia oceanica bank (- 15 ÷ 35 m). Seaward, a coarser, different siliciclastic component is found between - 35 and - 50 meters, related to depositional processes precedent to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Through the sand-wave belt a transition is observed to more bioclastic, poorly sorted gravely sands of red algae and benthic foraminifera, below the SWB. The sediment is completely bioclastic but rare breakthroughs of terrigenous material in proximity to the – 55 m paleo-shores show the presence of relict sediments underneath a limited surface cover. From a depth of 75 meters fine bioclastic-quartzose sands with bivalves and foraminifers are present due to and open marine reduced sedimentation during the last phases of the post-LGM sea level rise. The interpretation of these morphological and sedimentological context was based on the present-day knowledge of Pleistocene sea-level fluctuations. High-amplitude variations controlled by 20 Ky precession cycles are known to have taken place in the Glacial Pleistocene (800 Ky), while smaller amplitude 40 Ky obliquity cycles variations were dominant during the Lower and Middle Pleistocene. During this early time the actual inner shelf was probably mostly emerged and continental processes prevailed while the sea level oscillated around a mean value of - 60 m ca. (external paleo-shores). Only during the Middle-Late Pleistocene were the oscillations wide enough to submerge the inner shelf during highstands. An important feature attributable to these continental processes is the inner shelf depression, that can be interpreted as the product of paleo-river erosions, lastly reactivated during the “Würmian” lowstand (MIS 4 - 2). The terrigenous input was then insufficient to fill up the available space during the post-glacial sea-level rise. The middle-shelf paleo-relief (under the Posidonia bank) is interpreted as the result of the highstands most often reached during the obliquity dominant transgressive cycles of the Lower Pleistocene. The climatic-geomorphologic context determines the present day sedimentation, that is of a temperate water, mixed terrigenous-carbonate shelf. The sedimentation is highly siliciclastic in the inner shelf from fluvial-continental feeding, and bioclastic in the rest of the shelf with a maximum productivity along the Posidonia bank and its foreslope. A second important productivity is present at greater depths (50 - 65 m) with the rhodalgal biocenosys. In the middle and outer shelf the relict siliciclastic component is related to previous eustatic phases and attributable to continental and nearshore deposits lying underneath the actual shelf’s buildup. Analogous depositional contexts must be attributed to the precedent highstand phases of the Middle-Upper Pleistocene. Otherwise, during glacio-eustatic phases of falling, lowstand and rising sea level, the shelf was characterized by terrigenous continental sedimentation or shoreface sequences that are currently resedimented in the middle and outer shelf. Finally, the depositional model of this shelf alternates between phases of terrigenous-carbonate sedimentation of middle latitude, with a poorly rainy, warm Mediterranean climate during highstands, and terrigenous phases during lowstands with rather rainy, cooler Mediterranean climate. ...|$|R
