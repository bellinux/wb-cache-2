In the first few years, the park added a circle swing, a Whip, a miniature railroad, and in 1938, the Philadelphia Toboggan Company Rollo Coaster. World War II and the resulting rationing forced the park to close in 1943. Upon reopening in 1946, the park added the Caterpillar and a small showboat that sailed in Lake Bouquet.|$|E

5|$|Becoming an {{unrestricted}} free {{agent in the}} off-season, Alberts signed a two-year deal with the Carolina Hurricanes on July 16, 2009. The contract paid him $800,000 the <b>first</b> <b>year</b> <b>and</b> $1.3 million the second. After appearing in 62 games for Carolina, he was dealt at the 2009–10 trade deadline on March 3, 2010, to the Vancouver Canucks {{in exchange for a}} third round pick in the 2010 draft (Austin Levi). Between Carolina and Vancouver, Alberts finished the regular season with 3 goals and 12 points over 76 games. His defensive play struggled in his initial stint with Vancouver, often being made a healthy scratch. He continued to earn criticism from Vancouver fans and media in the playoffs, particularly for his lack of speed and for taking costly penalties.|$|E

He did especially well in his English and government classes. His humor and style began to reveal themselves during this time: Benchley was {{often called upon to}} entertain his fraternity brothers, and his impressions of classmates and professors became very popular. His performances gave him some local fame, and most entertainment programs on campus and many off-campus meetings recruited Benchley's talents.|$|E
5|$|Fellow Programme in Management (FPM) is a {{four-year}} Doctoral programme in Management started in 2000.

Students who have completed PGDM from any of the IIMs are admitted directly to the second year. The specialisations offered are Decision Sciences, Economics, Finance and Accounting, Human Resources Management, Information Technology and Systems, Marketing Management, Operations Management and Strategic Management. The institute does not charge tuition fees for fellowship program in addition to providing free hostel facility.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{assessment}} and learning approaches that some <b>first</b> <b>year</b> students employ {{to assist them}} in their transition into their <b>first</b> <b>year</b> of study <b>and</b> extends our previous work on <b>first</b> <b>year</b> student engagement <b>and</b> timely academic support (Penn-Edwards & Donnison, 2011). It is situated within the <b>First</b> <b>Year</b> transition <b>and</b> student engagement literature and specifically speaks to concepts of learning within that body of literature. In this paper we argue that while students are in the transitional period of their studies, the use of assessment as a motivator for learning (surface approach) is valid <b>first</b> <b>year</b> pedagogy <b>and</b> forms an initial learning stage in the student’s progress towards being lifelong learners...|$|R

5|$|Fielding {{started work}} on his fourth play, The Temple Beau, in April 1729, but did not finish {{until the end of}} the year. Rejected by his first theatre, the play had to be {{performed}} at another one, where it had 13 shows its <b>first</b> <b>year</b> <b>and</b> few revivals thereafter. The play is about Wilding, a young law student who gives up his studies to seek pleasure, and his attempts to marry a woman for her money. Fielding focuses on hypocrisy and gender equality in marriage with characters' interaction with Wilding.|$|E
5|$|Juveniles have a 43% {{chance of}} {{surviving}} their <b>first</b> <b>year,</b> <b>and</b> the annual survival rate of adults is about 80%. Choughs generally have a lifespan of about seven years, although an age of 17years has been recorded.

Chicks fledging under good conditions are more likely to survive to breeding age, and have longer breeding lives than those fledging under poor conditions.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the years}} {{there have been}} {{periodic}} attempts to restore service in southern Montana and North Dakota. A proposed plan from 1982–1983 would have involved North Dakota and Montana paying 45% of costs in the <b>first</b> <b>year</b> <b>and</b> 65% thereafter of a new section of the Empire Builder operating tri-weekly between Fargo and Sandpoint. This proposal went nowhere as neither state voted funds. Another proposal mooted in 1991 would have required an additional yearly federal appropriation of $12–15 million plus new equipment. In this scenario the Portland section would operate over the old route. Again, nothing came of it.|$|E

5|$|The female {{raises the}} young alone. One to six, but usually two to four, kittens are born in April or May, after roughly 60 to 70 days of gestation. Sometimes, a second litter is born {{as late as}} September. The female {{generally}} gives birth in an enclosed space, usually a small cave or hollow log. The young open their eyes by the ninth or tenth day. They start exploring their surroundings at four weeks and are weaned at about two months. Within three to five months, they begin to travel with their mother. They hunt by themselves by fall of their <b>first</b> <b>year,</b> <b>and</b> usually disperse shortly thereafter. In Michigan, however, they have been observed staying with their mother {{as late as the}} next spring.|$|E

Despite Bertuzzi's agent, Pat Morris, declaring that they would cease negotiations once the season began, Bertuzzi signed a four-year, $27.8 million deal with the Canucks on October 23, 2003. The contract took effect immediately, erasing the last year on his previous contract, and included a $3 million signing bonus ($2.5 million paid in the <b>first</b> <b>year</b> <b>and</b> $500,000 in the second).

5|$|After initiation, {{the child}} {{regularly}} visits the hospital outpatient clinic where {{he or she}} is seen by the dietitian and neurologist, and various tests and examinations are performed. These are held every three months for the <b>first</b> <b>year</b> <b>and</b> then every six months thereafter. Infants under one year old are seen more frequently, with the initial visit held after just two to four weeks. A period of minor adjustments is necessary to ensure consistent ketosis is maintained and to better adapt the meal plans to the patient. This fine-tuning is typically done over the telephone with the hospital dietitian and includes changing the number of calories, altering the ketogenic ratio, or adding some MCT or coconut oils to a classic diet. Urinary ketone levels are checked daily to detect whether ketosis has been achieved and to confirm that the patient is following the diet, though the level of ketones does not correlate with an anticonvulsant effect. This is performed using ketone test strips containing nitroprusside, which change colour from buff-pink to maroon in the presence of acetoacetate (one of the three ketone bodies).|$|E
