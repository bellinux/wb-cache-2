The {{resulting}} gold medal made him the first Black African to win at a major international sports competition. The high jump had an African sweep of the medals that year, with Uganda's Patrick Etolu finishing behind Ifeajuna and Nigeria's Osagie taking third place. Ifeajuna received a hero's welcome upon his return to Lagos and was paraded through the streets before speaking at a civic celebration. His image was later used for the front cover of a national <b>exercise</b> <b>book</b> for students in Nigeria.|$|E

The album was certified gold by the RIAA. In later years, Cher commented that her Geffen label [...] "hit years" [...] had been especially significant to her, [...] "because I was getting to do songs that I really loved... songs that really represented me, and they were popular!" [...] She released the <b>exercise</b> <b>book</b> Forever Fit in 1991, followed by the 1992 fitness videos [...] and [...] She embarked on the Love Hurts Tour during 1992.

It features three new songs: [...] "Oh No Not My Baby", [...] "Whenever You're Near", and [...] "Many Rivers to Cross".|$|E
500|$|The {{story was}} {{inspired}} by a pet rabbit Potter had as a child, which she named Peter Piper. Through the 1890s, Potter sent illustrated story letters to the children of her former governess, Annie Moore. In 1900, Moore, realizing the commercial potential of Potter's stories, suggested they be made into books. Potter embraced the suggestion, and, borrowing her complete correspondence (which had been carefully preserved by the Moore children), selected a letter written on 4 September 1893 to five-year-old Noel that featured a tale about a rabbit named Peter. Potter biographer Linda Lear explains: [...] "The original letter was too short to make a proper book so [...] added some text and made new black-and-white illustrations...and made it more suspenseful. These changes slowed the narrative down, added intrigue, and gave a greater sense of the passage of time. Then she copied it out into a stiff-covered <b>exercise</b> <b>book,</b> and painted a coloured frontispiece showing Mrs Rabbit dosing Peter with camomile tea".|$|E
500|$|Beatles biographer Bill Harry {{wrote that}} Lennon began drawing and writing creatively {{at an early}} age with the {{encouragement}} of his uncle. He collected his stories, poetry, cartoons and caricatures in a Quarry Bank High School <b>exercise</b> <b>book</b> that he called the Daily Howl. The drawings were often of crippled people, and the writings satirical, and throughout the book was an abundance of wordplay. According to classmate Bill Turner, Lennon created the Daily Howl to amuse his best friend and later Quarrymen bandmate Pete Shotton, to whom he would show his work before he let anyone else see it. Turner said that Lennon [...] "had an obsession for Wigan Pier. It kept cropping up", and in Lennon's story A Carrot in a Potato Mine, [...] "the mine {{was at the end of}} Wigan Pier." [...] Turner described how one of Lennon's cartoons depicted a bus stop sign annotated with the question, [...] "Why?". Above was a flying pancake, and below, [...] "a blind man wearing glasses leading along a blind dog—also wearing glasses".|$|E

500|$|Police {{searching the}} house at Wardle Brook Avenue found an old <b>exercise</b> <b>book</b> in which the name [...] "John Kilbride" [...] had been scribbled, which made them {{suspicious}} that Brady and Hindley might {{have been involved in}} the unsolved disappearances of other youngsters. A large collection of photographs was discovered in the house, many of which seemed to have been taken on Saddleworth Moor. One hundred and fifty officers were drafted to search the moor, looking for locations that matched the photographs. Initially the search was concentrated along the A628 road near Woodhead, but a close neighbour, 11-year-old Pat Hodges, had on several occasions been taken to the moor by Brady and Hindley and she was able to point out their favourite sites along the A635 road. On 16 October, police found an arm bone sticking out of the peat; officers presumed that they had found the body of John Kilbride, but soon discovered that it was that of Lesley Ann Downey. Her mother (now named Ann West after her marriage to Alan West) had been on the moor watching as the police conducted their search, but was not present when the body was found. She was shown clothing recovered from the grave, and identified it as belonging to her missing daughter.|$|E
500|$|The earlier Tintin albums {{reproduced}} {{the newspaper}} strips, which {{had come to}} appear weekly in Thursday supplements, two-page allotments of three tiers to a page. War shortages reduced the space for the strip by a third, and later the supplements disappeared completely; the comic appeared daily in the main newspaper as a four-panel strip. For publication in book form, Casterman insisted that Hergé must adhere to a new album format of four sixteen-page signatures, which gave sixty-two pages of story plus a cover page. Though the format reduced the page count, it maintained {{the same amount of}} story by reducing the size of the panels reproduced. As The Shooting Star progressed, Hergé cut up and laid out clippings of the strip in an <b>exercise</b> <b>book</b> in preparation for the new layouts. It was the first volume of The Adventures of Tintin to be originally published in the 62-page full-colour format that thereafter was the series standard (as opposed to first being published in a black and white newspaper strip reproduction format that all prior books had done). Casterman published the album in September 1942. Unlike the previous books in the series, because it was printed immediately in colour, it {{did not need to be}} totally redrawn. The 177 daily strips from the original serialisation were not enough to fill the 62 pages Casterman had allotted, so Hergé added large panels, such as a half-page panel of a giant telescope on page three. Hergé wanted to include a small gold star inside the [...] "o" [...] of [...] "Étoile" [...] on the cover page, but Casterman refused, deeming it too expensive.|$|E

2500|$|Evans left Dynasty in 1989, {{four months}} before the series came to an end, after only {{appearing}} in six episodes of the 22-episode season. After leaving Dynasty, Evans semi-retired from acting and made only occasional television appearances. Instead, she devoted her time to fitness issues {{and set up a}} small chain of fitness centers. In the 1990s, Evans hosted infomercials for Rejuvenique, a mask for toning facial muscles. She had previously written the Linda Evans Beauty and <b>Exercise</b> <b>book</b> in 1983. She also kept in touch with Forsythe, until he died on April 1, 2010, and she was very devastated by his passing.

However, the only artist's book {{containing}} Woodman's photographs that was published during her lifetime was Some Disordered Interior Geometries. [...] Released in January 1981 shortly before Woodman's death, it is 24 pages in length and is based upon selected pages from an Italian geometry <b>exercise</b> <b>book.</b> [...] On the pages, Woodman had attached 16 photographs and had added handwriting and white correction fluid. A study of the book notes that Woodman occasionally re-drew a form [...] "for emphasis or delight." [...] A reproduction of the book's original spreads shows purple-pink covers, pages which vary slightly in color, and traces of pink on several pages. Although the published version of the book has purple-pink covers, the interior pages are printed using only black, white, and shades of gray.|$|E
2500|$|With {{respect to}} {{instruction}} in composition, {{in addition to}} having Handel apply himself to traditional fugue and cantus firmus work, Zachow, recognizing Handel's precocious talents, systematically introduced Handel to the variety of styles and masterworks contained in his extensive library. He did this by requiring Handel to copy selected scores. [...] "I used to write like the devil in those days", Handel recalled much later. Much of this copying was entered into a notebook that Handel maintained {{for the rest of his}} life. Although it has since disappeared, the notebook has been sufficiently described to understand what pieces Zachow wished Handel to study. Among the chief composers represented in this <b>exercise</b> <b>book</b> were Johann Krieger, an [...] "old master" [...] in the fugue and prominent organ composer, Johann Caspar Kerll, a representative of the [...] "southern style" [...] after his teacher Frescobaldi and imitated later by Handel, Johann Jakob Froberger, an [...] "internationalist" [...] also closely studied by Buxtehude and Bach, and Georg Muffat, whose amalgam of French and Italian styles and his synthesis of musical forms influenced Handel.|$|E
