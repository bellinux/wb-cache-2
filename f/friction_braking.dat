5000|$|In an {{eddy current}} brake the {{magnetic}} field may be created by a permanent magnet, or an electromagnet so the braking force can be turned on and off or varied by varying the electric current in the electromagnet's windings. Another advantage is that since the brake does not work by friction, there are no brake shoe surfaces to wear out, necessitating replacement, as with <b>friction</b> <b>brakes.</b> A disadvantage is that since the braking force is proportional to velocity the brake has no holding force when the moving object is stationary, as is provided by static friction in a <b>friction</b> <b>brake,</b> so in vehicles it must be supplemented by a <b>friction</b> <b>brake.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Engine braking is a {{generally}} accepted practice {{and can help}} save wear on <b>friction</b> <b>brakes.</b> It is even used in some motor sports {{to reduce the risk}} of the <b>friction</b> <b>brakes</b> overheating. Additionally, fuel injected engines generally don't use any fuel while engine braking. This is known as DFCO or Deceleration Fuel Cut-Off. It can be used as the coast part of Burn and Coast, though coasting in neutral is generally more efficient [...] and engine off coasting is always more efficient.|$|R
50|$|Rheostatic braking {{was used}} on the trains, and {{required}} amendments to the standard P.C.M. (Pneumatic Camshaft Motor) controllers, to include the switching in of the rheostats. When the train was to be stopped, rheostatic braking was used first, after which <b>friction</b> <b>brakes</b> on the trailer cars were brought into action. If required, <b>friction</b> <b>brakes</b> on the motor cars could also be used. The rheostatic braking fades as the speed drops below 10 mph, and so slow speed braking was always by <b>friction</b> <b>brake.</b> As on the 1960 Stock, traction was supplied by four motors, one on each axle. The motors on each bogie were wired in series permanently, and the traction controller performed series/parallel switching of the pairs of motors. The handbrake used hydraulic power to apply it, and then remained locked on until hydraulic pressure was used to release it.|$|R

50|$|An {{alternative}} to acceleration or braking is ing, i.e. gliding along without propulsion. Coasting dissipates stored energy (kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy) against aerodynamic drag and rolling resistance which {{must always be}} overcome by the vehicle during travel. If coasting uphill, stored energy is also expended by grade resistance, but this energy is not dissipated since it becomes stored as gravitational potential energy which might be used later on. Using stored energy (via coasting) for these purposes is more efficient than dissipating it in <b>friction</b> <b>braking.</b>|$|E

40|$|Modern hybrid {{electric}} vehicles employ electric braking to recuperate energy during deceleration. However, currently {{anti-lock braking system}} (ABS) functionality is delivered solely by <b>friction</b> <b>brakes.</b> Hence regenerative braking is typically deactivated at a low deceleration threshold in case high slip develops at the wheels and ABS activation is required. If blending of <b>friction</b> and electric <b>braking</b> can be achieved during ABS events, {{there would be no}} need to impose conservative thresholds for deactivation of regenerative braking and the recuperation capacity of the vehicle would increase significantly. In addition, electric actuators are typically significantly faster responding and would deliver better control of wheel slip than <b>friction</b> <b>brakes.</b> In this work we present a control strategy for ABS on a fully electric vehicle with each wheel independently driven by an electric machine and <b>friction</b> <b>brake</b> independently applied at each wheel.

50|$|Brake fade is {{not always}} due to overheating. Water between the {{friction}} surfaces and the drum {{can act as a}} lubricant and reduce braking efficiency. The water tends to stay until heated sufficiently to vaporize, at which point braking efficiency returns. All <b>friction</b> <b>braking</b> systems have a maximum theoretical rate of energy conversion. Once that rate is reached, applying greater pedal pressure doesn't change it—in fact, the effects mentioned can substantially reduce it. Ultimately, this is what brake fade is, regardless of the mechanisms of its causes. Disc brakes are not immune to any of these processes, but they deal with heat and water more effectively than drums.|$|E

50|$|The WAG-5 {{is a type}} of {{electric}} locomotive used in India. It is the second most widely used locomotive in the Indian Railways, with a total of 1197 units built including variants. WAG5A is the one with Alstom traction motors. WAG5B is a converted WAM4. WAG5H(x) is with Hitachi traction motors. WAG5P(x) is a passenger dedicated class. WAG5(x)D are fitted with dual brakes and WAG5(x)E are fitted with air brakes. WAG5RH and WAG-5HR are fitted with Rheostatic or <b>Friction</b> <b>braking.</b> Another variant is WAG-5HG.The units with additional '6P' markings have all parallel grouped traction motors. WAG-5HB is built by BHEL. Some units are fitted with Static Converter(STC), Microprocessor, Dynamic brake resistors(DBR) and SI unit. Due to the advent of WAG-7 and WAG-9, these locos except WAG-5HA/HB are even used for passenger trains although it is a freight-dedicated locomotive. WAG-5HB is homed at Jhansi shed near BHEL's installations for maintenance purposes. WAG-5 has a shell of WAM-4. Units numbered till 23293 have side Louvre and round glass windows like WAM-4 and units after 23293 have WAG-7 style of Louvre for better ventilation. Recently, WAG-5 have been fitted with data loggers. Unit numbered 23026 was selected by RDSO for adoption of thyristor controlled electricals in 1995. This was done due to the loss of suppliers of tap changer control. Project began in 1992. The new prototype system built in collaboration with Bhabha Atomic Research Centre was fitted in the locomotive between 1997-98. However due to several problems like interference with signalling equipment, the project was ceased in 1999. The engine was rebuilt to original WAG-5 and designated as WAG-5P.|$|E
5000|$|The Jacobs Engine Brake {{has been}} on the market since 1961, better known as the “Jake Brake”. The value of an engine {{retarder}} had been recognised many years earlier. In England in 1905, the motor car manufacturer Rover provided on its [...] "16-20" [...] model an auxiliary camshaft and modified exhaust cams which, when selected via a camshaft pedal, lifted the exhaust valve twice to every revolution of the shaft, causing air to be taken in from the exhaust pipe on every downward movement of the piston, compressed on the upward stroke, and then exhausted. Rover declared that [...] "the braking effect of this device is very pronounced - in fact, for all ordinary purposes it can be used without recourse to the friction brakes".Some 26 years later, and despite the advances in <b>friction</b> <b>braking,</b> the need for such a system was experienced by inventor Clessie L. Cummins. In August 1931, Clessie Cummins, Ford Moyer, and Dave Evans driving a Cummins diesel powered Indiana truck from New York to Los Angeles attempted to set a new truck speed record across the continent. All went well until the descent of the Cajon Pass leading into San Bernardino, CA, a long and steep gravel road which almost led to the demise of the truck and its driver, Clessie Cummins.In 1955, Clessie began studying what might be done to turn his engine into an effective “brake”, or vehicle retarder. An idea for a practical method came to Clessie in 1957. The idea revolved around taking advantage of perfectly timed motion already built into Cummins and Detroit Diesel engines; these engines have a third cam on the main camshaft that activates the fuel injector of each cylinder. A simple retrofit mechanism could transfer motion to open the exhaust valve. A patent was ultimately granted by the U.S. Patent Office.Although the principles were proven by mechanically transferring the injector motion, a more practical method was to use a fully hydraulic motion and force transfer. The first retarder housings of the prototype design were installed on a Cummins diesel engine in a truck owned and operated by the Sheldon Oil Company. [...] The initial run with the engine brake was to one of their plants just at the eastern base of the grade, down the Sierras on U.S. Highway 50 near Lake Tahoe.|$|E
