The intrinsic ferromagnetism without free carriers is observed in oxygen-deficient films of anatase TiO_ 2 doped with transition metal impurities in cation sublattice. We suppose that ferromagnetic order arises due to superexchange between complexes [oxygen vacancies + magnetic impurities], which are stabilized by charge transfer from vacancies to impurities.

40|$|A {{microscopic}} {{model of}} indirect exchange interaction between transition metal impurities in dilute magnetic semiconductors (DMS) is proposed. The hybridization of the impurity d-electrons {{with the heavy}} hole band states is {{largely responsible for the}} transfer of electrons between the impurities, whereas <b>Hund</b> <b>rule</b> for the electron occupation of the impurity d-shells makes the transfer spin selective. The model is applied to such systems as $n-$type GaN:Mn and $p-$type (Ga,Mn) As, $p-$type (Ga,Mn) P. In $n-$type DMS with Mn$^{ 2 +/ 3 +}$ impurities the exchange mechanisms is rather close to the kinematic exchange proposed by Zener for mixed-valence Mn ions. In $p-$type DMS ferromagnetism is governed by the kinematic mechanism involving the kinetic energy gain of heavy hole carriers caused by their hybridization with 3 d electrons of Mn$^{ 2 +}$ impurities.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{validity}} of Hund's first rule for the spin multiplicity in circular molecules - made of real or artificial atoms such as quantum dots - by considering a perturbative approach in the Coulomb interaction in the extended Hubbard model with both on-site and long-range interactions. In this approximation, we show that an anti-Hund rule always defines the ground state in a molecule with 4 N atoms at half-filling. In all other cases (i. e. number of atoms not multiple of four, or a 4 N molecule away from half-filling) both the singlet and the triplet outcomes are possible, as determined primarily {{by the total number}} of electrons in the system. In some instances, the <b>Hund</b> <b>rule</b> is always obeyed and the triplet ground state is realized mathematically for any values of the on-site and long range interactions, while for other filling situations the singlet is also possible but only if the long-range interactions exceed a certain threshold, relatively to the on-site interaction.
