500|$|... "Ordinary men {{placed in}} {{extraordinary}} circumstances" [...] is a prevalent theme in The Sword of Shannara. Brooks credits Tolkien with introducing this theme of mundane heroism into fantasy literature and influencing his own fiction. [...] "y protagonists are {{cut from the}} same bolt of cloth as Bilbo and Frodo Baggins. It was Tolkien's genius to reinvent the traditional epic fantasy by making the central character neither God nor hero, but a simple man {{in search of a}} way to do the right thing. ... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>impressed</b> enough by how it had changed the face of epic fantasy that I never gave a second thought to not using it as the cornerstone of my own writing." ...|$|E
500|$|In Washington, {{the company}} was {{quartered}} in the Ladies' Gallery of the Senate Chamber, in the Capitol. The 350 Pennsylvania troops who first reached Washington on April 18 {{became known as the}} First Defenders and, after the war, the survivors formed an association with that name. While they were lodged at the Capitol, President Lincoln, Secretary of State William H. Seward, and Secretary of War Simon Cameron visited. Bosbyshell recalled Lincoln, [...] "yes, here, towering over all in the room was the great central figure of the war. I remember how <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>impressed</b> by the kindliness of his face and awkward hanging of his arms and legs, his apparent bashfulness in the presence of these first soldiers of the Republic, and with it all a grave, rather mournful bearing in his attitude." ...|$|E

500|$|Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave a {{positive}} review, {{stating that the}} reveal was [...] "an effective narrative, and one which creates a [...] "satisfying" [...] resolution for the viewer {{as well as the}} character. Veronica Mars {{has done a good job}} of subverting expectations on a regular basis, but it’s still a TV show, with requirements for satisfying resolutions. [...] Which is my roundabout way of saying that while I wasn’t surprised by the reveal that it was Duncan Kane, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>impressed</b> by how well it worked up to that point. It had to be Duncan or someone totally irrelevant and shocking."

500|$|Santoro was {{recommended}} by Paulo Autran, who acted {{along with him}} in the TV series Hilda Furacão. After seeing Santoro's acting, he was Bodanzky's first choice for Neto's role; [...] "I never even thought of another person. ... When I saw him, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>impressed</b> with his giving of himself to the role/character. I knew that Neto was him." [...] Santoro read the book and was [...] "shocked," [...] which led him to contact Carrano; after talking to the author, he was convinced to take the role. He found the story [...] "very moving, but kind of over the top," [...] and was worried about overacting and making the character [...] "fake." [...] To prepare himself for the role, he talked with interns and watched productions on the subject, among them the film One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by Miloš Forman.|$|E
500|$|... "Like Father, Like Clown" [...] {{was written}} by the duo of Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky. Krusty's {{religion}} had not {{been part of the}} original concept of the character, so Kogen and Wolodarsky decided to parody The Jazz Singer and establish that Krusty is Jewish. They pitched the idea to co-executive producer Sam Simon, who rejected it, but it was approved by James L. Brooks. Krusty's last name, Krustofski, was established in this episode as pitched by Al Jean. The portion of the episode where characters quote the Bible in support or opposition of clowning were carefully researched. Cited passages from the Bible include Exodus 20:12 and Joshua 1:8. The quotations from the Talmud were also researched, and two rabbis, Lavi Meier and Harold M. Schulweis, were credited as [...] "special technical consultants". Schulweis was asked {{to take a look at}} a draft of the script. While not a fan of the show, he felt [...] "it was profound" [...] and added some corrections. He later commented, [...] "I thought it had a Jewish resonance to it. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>impressed</b> by the underlying moral seriousness." ...|$|E

5000|$|His {{obituary}} for the Royal Society {{was written}} by Blackett, who also broadcast a radio appreciation of Williams in 1949, in which he said: [...] Looking back on Williams's short life, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>impressed</b> by the amount he achieved. We physicists feel constantly his loss. His distinctive gift of deep physical understanding, using only relatively simple mathematics, would have been of the greatest value to us today.|$|R

500|$|In 1955 Larkin became University Librarian at the University of Hull, a post he held {{until his}} death. Professor R.L. Brett, who was {{chairman}} of the library committee that appointed him and a friend, wrote, [...] "At first <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>impressed</b> with the time he spent in his office, arriving early and leaving late. It was only later that I realised that his office was also his study where he spent hours on his private writing as well as the work of the library. Then he would return home and on a good many evenings start writing again." [...] For his first year he lodged in bedsits. In 1956, at the age of 34, he rented a self-contained flat on the top-floor of 32 Pearson Park, a three-storey red-brick house overlooking the park, previously the American Consulate. This, it seems, was the vantage point later commemorated in the poem High Windows. Of the city itself Larkin commented: [...] "I never thought about Hull until I was here. Having got here, it suits me in many ways. It is a little on the edge of things, I think even its natives would say that. I rather like being on the edge of things. One doesn't really go anywhere by design, you know, you put in for jobs and move about, you know, I've lived in other places." [...] In the post-war years, Hull University underwent significant expansion, as was typical of British universities during that period. When Larkin took up his appointment there, the plans for a new university library were already far advanced. He made a great effort in just a few months to familiarize himself with them before they were placed before the University Grants Committee; he suggested a number of emendations, some major and structural, all of which were adopted. It was built in two stages, and in 1967 it was named the Brynmor Jones Library after Sir Brynmor Jones, the university's vice-chancellor.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was at the}} International Congress of Philosophy in Paris in {{the year}} 1900 that I {{became aware of the}} {{importance}} of logical reform for the philosophy of mathematics. ... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>impressed</b> by the fact that, in every discussion, [...] showed more precision and more logical rigour than was shown by anybody else. ... It was [...] that gave the impetus to my own views on the principles of mathematics.|$|E

As I read his letter, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>impressed</b> that {{this was one of the}} places I had seen in vision, and I immediately telegraphed him to secure the property without delay.

2500|$|Director Konuma and {{script-writer}} Tanaka both {{agreed that}} Dan's novel was unfilmable, and made significant {{changes to the}} story. Dan and Naomi Tani both objected to this, and there was considerable friction {{between the two sides}} over the story during the writing of the script. Konuma later commented about Naomi Tani's role in this matter, [...] "while we worked on the final script, she was very argumentative. However, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>impressed</b> with her change in attitude after the company's final decision. During the shoot, she never gave us a problem. Instead- she was committed. I admire her professionalism." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1990 and 1991, the KLF also remixed tracks by Depeche Mode ("Policy of Truth"), the Moody Boys ("What Is Dub?"), and Pet Shop Boys ("So Hard" [...] {{from the}} Behaviour album, and [...] "It Must Be Obvious"). Pet Shop Boy Neil Tennant {{described}} the process: [...] "When {{they did the}} remix of 'So Hard', they didn't do a remix at all, they re-wrote the record ... I {{had to go and}} sing the vocals again, they did it in a different way. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>impressed</b> that Bill Drummond had written all the chords out and played it on an acoustic guitar, very thorough." ...|$|E

[...] Louis Untermeyer added his voice: [...] "I particularly like your fusion of observation and whimsicality, as well as your avoidance of the poetic stereotypes." [...] Rolfe Humphries was intrigued by Bartlett's poetic techniques: [...] "I enjoyed your poems and admire many...." [...] About Behold This Dreamer, Gustav Davidson wrote: [...] "I enjoyed reading these poems. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>impressed</b> by their precision, clarity, and technical competence."

As she described it:The next morning I was awakened by a voice which seemed to me speaking in my heart, these words, [...] "GO TO KIOWA," [...] and my hands were lifted and thrown down and the words, [...] "I'LL STAND BY YOU." [...] The words, [...] "Go to Kiowa," [...] were spoken in a murmuring, musical tone, low and soft, but [...] "I'll stand by you," [...] was very clear, positive and emphatic. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>impressed</b> with a great inspiration, the interpretation was very plain, it was this: [...] "Take something in your hands, and throw at these places in Kiowa and smash them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ruddock {{went back}} to Japan in 1966 {{specifically}} to learn Aikido, travelling six weeks by sea. He first saw Ueshiba about four days after he started regular training. [...] "He was {{the real reason for}} my Aikido pilgrimage to Japan. I had read quite a bit about this miraculous old man and having seen the pictures – I wanted the real thing. I knew what he did was special and wanted to be like that too – but I did not feel the same 'Wow – this is something else!" [...] kind of response that others report. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>impressed</b> and intrigued – but not overawed. My journey to Japan was a personal spiritual quest and I realised that this man was someone you only get to be around once – he was a true mystic. Over the coming months and years I was to see him on a daily basis (when he was in Tokyo). As a karate man with both Judo and Jujitsu experience, I was not easily impressed by people flying through the air for apparently no reason. I had made a huge effort by modern standards to be there to learn what was on offer but – over the first few months I began to think – 'Can this really be true, these guys are just falling over...' Then, little by little, as other guys who had 'gone for him' described their bewildering experiences of falling ( [...] for no good reason [...] ) and also my own careful observations of the reactions of his Ukes – I was convinced that this man was incredible." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{striking}} exterior {{design of}} A, which designer Starck had likened to being [...] "more {{like a fish}} than a building", polarized opinions from the outset. Jonathan Beckett, chief executive of London yacht brokers Burgess, was initially skeptical, but changed his mind after seeing the boat in person in the Caribbean: [...] "I have to say <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>impressed.</b> It's a very exciting boat to watch. It's simply unlike anything that's ever been done before." [...] David Pelly of Boat International was also enamoured, saying she was [...] "...the most extraordinary yacht launched in recent memory. It is stunning." [...] And writing about the world's biggest mega yachts in the New York Times in 2011, Nazanin Lankarini argued that A was [...] "even more desirable than her larger sisters by virtue of lines reminiscent of a nuclear submarine". A {{was one of the}} featured vessels in the 2011 edition of The Superyachts, where she was described as [...] "bold and eccentric."By contrast, Power & Motoryacht magazine columnist Diane Byrne opined that [...] "overall she does not float my boat (sorry, kids, couldn’t resist), but I do quite like the inverted bow design", while Donald Starkey, a British yacht designer, commented that A [...] "...is aggressive, like a giant finger pointing at you. It seems to {{have nothing to do with}} the whole idea of yachting, which is about cruising around at a leisurely pace, and enjoying your friends and the sea". Maritime commentator Peter Mello was even more scathing in his assessment, deriding her as [...] "one of the most hideous vessels ever to sail the seas". The Wall Street Journals Robert Frank was initially also an outspoken critic, calling A [...] "one of the ghastliest megayachts ever created" [...] and [...] "more like a cruiser for Darth Vader's navy than a family pleasure boat for the Mediterranean" [...] when she was launched. However, in a follow-up blog several months later, he confessed: [...] "I've gained a bit more respect for it. Technically, it's impressive: Because of her inverted bow, the boat barely makes a splash in the front when it's speeding along at 24knots. And it's different in a way few yachts are...So even though I still think it's a monster, A gets a tip of the hat for taking a risk and being different".|$|E
