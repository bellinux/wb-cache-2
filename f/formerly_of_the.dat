5|$|In 1994, {{the band}} listened to {{hundreds}} of tapes sent in by vocalists before convincing Blaze Bayley, <b>formerly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> band Wolfsbane who had supported Iron Maiden in 1990, to audition for them.

After the successful addition of the Braehead Clan and the Dundee Stars for the 2010–11 season, the EIHL reported that it had entered discussions with the Fife Flyers <b>formerly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defunct BNL, and then resident in the SNL. On 24 June 2011, it was confirmed that the Fife Flyers had been admitted to the EIHL in time for the commencement of the 2011–12 season.|$|E
5|$|Formed on 13 November 1939 at Redbank Camp, Brisbane, the 2/9th Battalion was {{the first}} of four {{infantry}} battalions raised in Queensland for the all-volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF). Initially assigned to the 6th Division, the battalion formed part of the 18th Brigade, along with the 2/10th, 2/11th and 2/12th Battalions. Its first commanding officer was Lieutenant Colonel James Eric Gifford Martin, <b>formerly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 42nd Battalion, a Militia battalion based in Rockhampton. The majority of the battalion's officers were drawn from the Militia; although, like many of the 2nd AIF units, it was initially supplied with a Regular officer to serve in the role as adjutant.|$|E

The tour included the session players Gary Windo and Ann Sheldon, {{as well as the}} keyboard player Ed Buller. One person who did not come with them was Vince Ely, whose long-simmering dissatisfaction with the band finally led to his departure, just after the album's recording was completed.

The first lineup included Michael Barragan (formerly of Plexi), Dez Cadena (formerly of Black Flag), and Taz Bentley (<b>formerly</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Reverend Horton Heat). The band disbanded before the end of 1999. After working on new material with drummer Geoff Reading, Loaded was reformed in 2001, adding guitarist Mike Squires and Jeff Rouse to the line-up, though both were briefly replaced by guitarist Dave Kushner (Velvet Revolver, formerly of Wasted Youth and Electric Love Hogs) and bassist George Stuart Dahlquist (formerly of Asva and Burning Witch) in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Nick Sheppard, <b>formerly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bristol-based {{band the}} Cortinas, and Vince White were {{recruited}} as the Clash's new guitarists. Howard continued as the drummer.

5|$|One of {{only two}} machine gun battalions {{available}} for the defending British and Commonwealth forces, as preparations were made to repulse the expected Japanese assault across the Johore Strait, the battalion was split up to provide support to troops from the 22nd and 27th Australian Infantry Brigades and the 44th Indian Infantry Brigade around {{the western part of}} the island, where the Japanese assault was expected. On 7 February, due to concerns about the lack of defending infantry, about 90 machine gun reinforcements, who had been hastily formed into a sixth company—'E'—were detached at this time to form part of a 400-strong Special Reserve Battalion, initially under the command of an officer from the 2/19th Infantry Battalion and later taken over by Major Albert Saggers, <b>formerly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2/4th Machine Gun Battalion.|$|E

5|$|Preliminary casting {{began in}} March 1987, with Justman and Berman {{in charge of}} the process. In May, the actors who were to receive star billing were announced. In the initial press release, only three actors were discussed; {{primarily}} LeVar Burton as La Forge, due to the actor's appearances in the mini-series Roots. Also included in that release were the announcements of Patrick Stewart, a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company as Captain Picard, and Jonathan Frakes <b>formerly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North and South miniseries. Marina Sirtis and Denise Crosby were cast as Masha Hernandez and Deanna Troi respectively, but Roddenberry decided to switch the roles, at which point Hernandez became Yar.|$|E
5|$|RAF Weston-super-Mare {{was opened}} in 1936 by No. 24 Group, {{with a single}} tarmac runway. It served as a flying {{candidates}} selection and initial training facility, and as a relief airport during World War II, latterly as the Polish Air Force Staff College from April 1944 to April 1946. After the war it served as a logistics supply station, with helicopter makers Westland Helicopters on site until closure in 1987. Today there is an operational heliport on site used occasionally by the RAF Search and Rescue service. The former Westland site, which closed in 2002, houses the Helicopter Museum featuring examples of Westland aircraft. Pride of place is given to an immaculate Westland Wessex HCC Mk.4, <b>formerly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Queen's Flight.|$|E
5|$|Soon, {{the band}} hired Ray Tabano, a {{childhood}} friend of Tyler, as rhythm guitarist and began playing local shows. Aerosmith played their first gig in Mendon, Massachusetts at Nipmuc Regional High School (now Miscoe Hill Middle School) on November 6, 1970. In 1971, Tabano was replaced by Brad Whitford, who also attended the Berklee School of Music and was <b>formerly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> band Earth Inc. Whitford, from Reading, Massachusetts, had already played at Reading's AW Coolidge Middle School. Other than a period from July 1979 to April 1984, the line-up of Tyler, Perry, Hamilton, Kramer, and Whitford has stayed the same.|$|E

5|$|The 2006 {{off-season}} {{began with}} a trade for Alex Tanguay, <b>formerly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Colorado Avalanche, and with Sutter relinquishing his head coaching position to assistant Jim Playfair so he could focus on his duties as general manager. Despite a marked improvement in team offence and a solid 96-point season, it was only good enough for eighth place in a Western Conference where seven teams cracked the 100-point barrier. In the playoffs, Calgary fell in six games to the top seeded Red Wings in the first round. During the series, the Flames were fined by the NHL for several stick-related penalties in the fifth game. Notably, backup goaltender Jamie McLennan was suspended five games for slashing Red Wings forward Johan Franzen. Franzen would score the series clinching goal in the Game 6 defeat in Double Overtime.|$|E
5|$|The Ecstatic is the 2009 fourth studio album by American rapper Mos Def. After venturing {{further away}} from hip hop with an acting career and two poorly {{received}} albums, Mos Def signed with Downtown Records and recorded The Ecstatic primarily at the Record Plant in Los Angeles. He worked with producers such as Preservation, Mr. Flash, Oh No, and Madlib, the latter two of whom reused instrumentals they had produced on Stones Throw Records. Singer Georgia Anne Muldrow, <b>formerly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> record label, {{was one of the}} album's few guest vocalists, along with rappers Slick Rick and Talib Kweli. For its front cover, a still from Charles Burnett's 1978 film Killer of Sheep was reproduced in red tint.|$|E
5|$|The Flames hired Cliff Fletcher, <b>formerly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> St. Louis Blues, {{to serve}} as the team's general manager. Former Montreal Canadiens player Bernie Geoffrion was hired as the team's head coach. The team stocked its roster via an {{expansion}} draft held on June 6, 1972. Fletcher focused on goaltending, choosing Phil Myre with his first selection and rookie Dan Bouchard with his second. Fletcher drafted a competent roster, but one that was young and inexperienced. Two days later, the Flames selected Jacques Richard as the second overall pick in the 1972 NHL Amateur Draft.|$|E
