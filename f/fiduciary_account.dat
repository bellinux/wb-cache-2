Bastarache stated his intention to contact the greatest number of claimants possible and to interview many of them personally. He explained that to ensure the confidentiality of the claimants, the federal government would transfer to a <b>fiduciary</b> <b>account</b> under his control the amounts required for the compensation payments and that he would make the payments directly to claimants. Bastarache was designated the [...] "sole and independent decision maker" [...] for the claims process. His decisions in the matter were not open to review by the RCMP or appeal by the parties.(Settlement news conference Oct. 6, 2016) ...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} proposes {{an explanation}} of why {{the state has a}} special moral obligation to protect individuals in its legal territory against violence committed by private actors. Having {{an explanation of}} this obligation will allow us to better determine a number of its major characteristics, including to whom the state owes this obligation [...] the scope of the obligation [...] apart from those persons actually located in the state's legal territory. It argues that the state has a special moral obligation to protect because the state is the fiduciary of those individuals in its legal territory and has a fiduciary obligation to advance their purposes reasonably. Since obtaining security from violence is a normal and fundamental purpose of individuals, the state has a fiduciary obligation to protect them from private violence. To support this conclusion, the dissertation evaluates whether the most plausible explanations of the special obligation to protect can account for our moral intuitions. Apart from the fiduciary explanation, it considers and rejects four alternatives. First, the obligation to protect might arise as an application of an inherent duty to promote justice, including by protecting against acts of violence. Second, it might arise because the state normally contributes causally to the harm from most or all acts of violence that occur in its territory, so it has an obligation to protect against that harm. Third, it might arise because the state implicitly promises to protect by communicating a claim that it has a monopoly on the legitimate use of force. Fourth, it might arise because the exercise of coercive political control is legitimate only if the state simultaneously protects against violence. After rejecting these alternatives, the dissertation explains, defends, and applies the <b>fiduciary</b> <b>account</b> {{to the question of the}} scope of the special obligation to protect...|$|E

Previous studies and AFM managers (Reily and Sheppard, 1980; Naval Audit Service, 1981; Needham, 1981) have expressed the opinion that the management of these funds {{can and should be}} improved. This thesis compares the current system of accounting and control to a model of management control developed in the thesis. The thesis presents specific recommendations for improving the management control of AFM funds in the areas of performance measurement and standard development, budgeting, information feedback, and responsibility accounting. Further, it suggests a refocusing of the present system from <b>fiduciary</b> <b>accounting</b> and control toward management control. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R

40|$|In this report, Blattmachr and Gans {{explain how}} new {{regulations}} promulgated in January make reaching and fundamental changes to some tax rules that {{are dependent on}} the concept of <b>fiduciary</b> <b>accounting</b> income (FAI) under local law. The new regulations, they write, generally will respect a determination of income made by (1) a trustee 2 ̆ 7 s power granted under state law to adjust from the income account to the corpus account or the reverse, (2) a conversion of a pay all income trust to a unitrust one pursuant to state law, or (3) an allocation of capital gain to FAI in some cases. The regulations also provide that those conversions will not cause a beneficiary to be treated as having made a gift or any party to have made an income taxable exchange if the powers are exercised or the conversion occurs pursuant to a state statute. But, the authors note, the regulations indicate that adverse consequences may ensue if the safe harbor boundaries in defining income under the new regulations are not followed. In addition, the regulations probably have created a substantial advantage for administering trusts pursuant to a power of adjustment rather than converting them to unitrusts, in many cases. Blattmachr and Gans believe it is hard to overemphasize the importance of the new regulations. Unfortunately, they write, the new regulations appear to contain direct contradictions on important matters, which will likely perplex trustees and their advisors until clarifications are made. Also, although the new regulations provide significant new guidance as to when capital gain of a trust may form part of DNI and, therefore, may be taxed to a beneficiary, no guidance is provided as to when, how, and to what degree the exercise of a power to adjust from the corpus account to the income account may result in capital gain becoming part of DNI. The authors conclude that this omission means it will be difficult for trustees and their advisors to determine, in some situations, how much the adjustment should be...|$|R
50|$|A {{directed}} {{trust is}} an investment trust in which the trustee is directed {{by a number of}} other trust participants in implementing the trust's execution. That trustee is referred to as a Directed Trustee. Examples of other trust participants include a distribution committee, trust protector, or investment advisor. A directed trustee's role often includes: following distribution and investment instructions, holding legal title to the trust assets, providing <b>fiduciary</b> and tax <b>accounting,</b> coordinating trust participants and offering dispute resolution among those participants. Typically, these duties and the other participants in the trust are defined and governed by the trust document itself.|$|R

40|$|AnalysisThe {{fiduciary}} doctrine {{holds that}} a fiduciary must avoid {{a conflict of}} duty and personal interest and must not derive any profit from his fiduciary position. Liability for breach attracts the more extensive remedies of equity's armoury, including the gain-stripping remedy of an account of profits. With respect to a <b>fiduciary's</b> liability to <b>account,</b> although Hong Kong courts recognise that a causal connection between a breach and its ensuing gain is required, there have so far been scant judicial remarks on this front. This article argues that issues of causation and remoteness in the award of an account of profits for a breach of fiduciary duty can be determined by a two-stage inquiry. First, {{this article examines the}} possible approaches to establishing factual causation and suggests that a probabilistic approach to causation may be a better way forward. The answer to the second inquiry depends on the nature and purposes of the equitable principles involved. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
