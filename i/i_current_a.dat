40|$|Thermospheric drag is the {{significant}} force act-ing on orbiting satellites with altitudes {{equal to the}} space shuttle operating altitudes. This drag reduces orbiting lifetimes to typically < 100 days. Electrodynamic tethers (EDTs) provide an ex-cellent means of maintaining, boosting, and or-bit maneuvering small satellites in low Earth or-bit {{without the use of}} propellant over extended periods. An analysis is presented which looks at the use of EDTs on small satellites and for multiple orbital configurations.

A much higher rate of copper deposition is necessary to improve this electroplating process ignificantly. To achieve this higher ate for the deposition of copper on a round bar, the solution flow is directed normal to the axis of a round bar. The current efficiency r/c u for copper deposition on a round bar, 9 mm in diameter, has been determined from 1 M H 2 SO 4 + 1 M CuSO 4 bath {{as a function of}} current density, solution flow rate and temperature. A set of relations has been proposed for calculating the current efficiency t/c u for a broad range of parameters.

40|$|The Golgi {{cells have}} been {{recently}} shown to beat regularly in vitro (Forti et al., 2006. J. Physiol. 574, 711 - 729). Four main currents {{were shown to}} be involved, namely <b>a</b> persistent sodium <b>current</b> (<b>I</b> Na-p), <b>an</b> h <b>current</b> (<b>I</b> h), <b>an</b> SK-type calcium-dependent potassium <b>current</b> (<b>I</b> K-AHP), and <b>a</b> slow M-like potassium <b>current</b> (<b>I</b> K-slow). These ionic currents could take part, together with others, also to different aspects of neuronal excitability like responses to depolarizing and hyperpolarizing current injection. However, the ionic mechanisms and their interactions remained largely hypothetical. In this work, we have investigated the mechanisms of Golgi cell excitability by developing a computational model. The model predicts that pacemaking is sustained by subthreshold oscillations tightly coupled to spikes. I Na-p and I K-slow emerged as the critical determinants of oscillations. I h {{also played a role}} by setting the oscillatory mechanism into the appropriate membrane potential range. I K-AHP, though taking part to the oscillation, appeared primarily involved in regulating the ISI following spikes. The combination with other <b>currents,</b> in particular <b>a</b> resurgent sodium <b>current</b> (<b>I</b> Na-r) and <b>an</b> A-current (I K-A), allowed a precise regulation of response frequency and delay.
