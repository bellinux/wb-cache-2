"As I {{got down}} before the canoe," [...] writes he in his journal, [...] "I {{spent some time}} in viewing the rivers, and the land at the Fork, which I think {{extremely}} well situated for a fort, as it has the absolute command of both rivers. The land at the point is twenty or twenty-five feet above the common surface of the water, and a considerable bottom of <b>flat,</b> <b>well</b> timbered land all around it, very convenient for building. The rivers are each {{a quarter of a mile}} or more across, and run here very nearly at right angles; Allegany bearing north-east, and Monongahela south-east. The former of these two is a very rapid and swift-running water, the other deep and still, without any perceptible fall." [...] The Ohio company had intended to build a fort about two miles from this place, on the south-east side of the river; but Washington gave the fork the decided preference. French engineers of experience proved the accuracy of his military eye, by subsequently choosing it for the site of Fort Duquesne, noted in frontier history.|$|E

[...] "Why, on these proud Zulus, this little family of men who call themselves the 'People of Heaven,' and swallow other tribes as the great tree-snake swallows kids and small bucks, {{and when it is}} fat with them cries to the world, 'See how big I am! Everything is inside of me.' I am a Ndwande, one of those peoples whom it pleases the Zulus to call 'Amatefula'--poor hangers-on who talk with an accent, nothing but bush swine. Therefore I would see the swine tusk the hunter. Or, if that may not be, I would see the black hunter laid low by the rhinoceros, the white rhinoceros of your race, Macumazahn, yes, even if it sets its foot upon the Ndwande boar as well. There, I have told you, and this is the reason that I live so long, for I will not die until these things have come to pass, as come to pass they will. What did Chaka, Senzangakona's son, say when the little red assegai, the assegai with which he slew his mother, aye and others, some of whom were near to me, was in his liver? What did he say to Mbopa and the princes? Did he not say that he heard the feet of a great white people running, of a people who should stamp the Zulus <b>flat?</b> <b>Well,</b> I, 'The-thing-who-should-not-have-been-born,' live on until that day comes, and when it comes I think that you and I, Macumazahn, shall not be far apart, and that is why I have opened out my heart to you, I who have knowledge of the future. There, I speak no more of these things that are to be, who perchance have already said too much of them. Yet do not forget my words. Or forget them if you will, for I shall remind you of them, Macumazahn, when the feet of your people have avenged the Ndwandes and others whom it pleases the Zulus to treat as dirt." ...|$|E

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} for including {{the effects of}} viscosity {{in the design of}} supersonic wind tunnel nozzles, the effect being presented {{in the form of a}} modification to the non-viscous, or perfect fluid, nozzle shapes. The modification essentially consists of providing additional expansion area to compensate for the retarded flow near the wall, and is estimated from considerations of possible boundary layer growth along a heat insulated <b>flat</b> <b>well</b> with a pressure gradient, when both the velocity profile and friction coefficient are assumed. It is shown that the modification to the perfect fluid shape becomes very pronounced for design Mach numbers above five and results in a shorter nozzle length for a given test section size than that predicted from perfect fluid theory. At a Mach number of 10, this method results in a nozzle length reduction of 50 % indicating that the boundary layer occupies this percentage of the test section for the shortened nozzle. Design curves are presented from which the modification to a specific perfect fluid nozzle shape may be computed for Mach numbers up to 10...|$|E

40|$|Obtaining large, <b>flat,</b> <b>well</b> ordered {{crystals}} {{represents the}} key to structure determination by electron crystallography. Multilamellar crystals of Ca(2 +) -ATPase are {{a good candidate for}} this methodology, and we have optimized methods of crystallization and of preparation for cryoelectron microscopy. In particular, high concentrations of glycerol were found to prevent nucleation and to reduce stacking; thus, by seeding solutions containing 40 % glycerol, we obtained thin crystals that were 5 - 30 microns in diameter and 2 - 10 unit cells thick. We found that removing vesicles and minimizing concentrations of divalent cations were critical to preparing flat crystals in the frozen-hydrated state. Finally, we developed two methods for determining the number of lamellae composing individual crystals, information that is required for structure determination of this crystal form. The first method, using low magnification images of freeze-dried crystals, is more practical in our case. Nevertheless, the alternative method, involving analysis of Laue zones from electron diffraction patterns of slightly tilted crystals, may be of general use in structure determination from thin, three-dimensional crystals...|$|E
40|$|Although chalcopyrites {{have been}} used as {{absorber}} in thin film solar cells for nearly 30 years, not much is known about their surface structure, which might be an important information towards growth and interface optimization. Surface reconstructions, a general feature of semiconductor surfaces, have not been reported on Cu III VI 2 001 surfaces so far. We have thus studied the chalcopyrite CuGaSe 2 001 surface preparation by Ar ion bombardment and annealing. The samples were grown by MOCVD on a 001 GaAs substrate on axis with a near stoichiometric ratio Cu Ga. The preparation was optimized so that we finally obtained a <b>flat,</b> <b>well</b> ordered surface. The surface composition and structure was analyzed with AES, XPS, and LEED. On uncontaminated surfaces, a 1 x 4 reconstruction was observed with LEED which we tentatively interpret as a Se terminated surface.

40|$|For {{the last}} 15 years, Colombia has {{developed}} a research process leading {{to the expansion of}} its agricultural frontier at the <b>flat</b> <b>well</b> drained savannas of the Eastern Plains, by improving predominantly acid soils with liming to increase base saturation with depth, vertical liming —as its referred locally—, crop rotation with rice, corn, soybeans, and with the potential to include other crops like cotton in the rotation system. To achieve this, a pioneering research in Colombia was conducted to determine the adaptation of cotton in the acid conditions of the high plains improved sheets. An Agronomic evaluation test was developed using five elite genotypes of cotton in a design of a randomized complete block at four locations in soils with base saturation above 80 %. The results identified a genotype (LC- 156), which presented an adaptation to the high plains, associated with an average yield of 2. 2 t/ha of cottonseed, 1. 5 t/ha of cotton fiber type medium-long, a percentage of fiber extraction above 36. 0 %. The comparative advantage of this region for sustainable cotton production is given by the yield of cotton fiber —which ishigher than the national average—, to the 33. 2 % reduction in production costs, the quality of long/medium-fiber destined for export and the absence of the pest insect of greatest economic impact in Colombia: the weevil (Anthonomus grandis Boheman) ...|$|E
