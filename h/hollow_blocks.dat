25|$|Once in place, {{concrete}} offers great {{energy efficiency}} over {{the lifetime of}} a building. Concrete walls leak air far less than those made of wood frames. Air leakage accounts for {{a large percentage of}} energy loss from a home. The thermal mass properties of concrete increase the efficiency of both residential and commercial buildings. By storing and releasing the energy needed for heating or cooling, concrete's thermal mass delivers year-round benefits by reducing temperature swings inside and minimizing heating and cooling costs. While insulation reduces energy loss through the building envelope, thermal mass uses walls to store and release energy. Modern concrete wall systems use both external insulation and thermal mass to create an energy-efficient building. Insulating concrete forms (ICFs) are <b>hollow</b> <b>blocks</b> or panels made of either insulating foam or rastra that are stacked to form the shape of the walls of a building and then filled with reinforced concrete to create the structure.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The first Saudi Building Code (SBC) {{was issued}} in 2007 to be {{verified}} and tentatively applied reaching to the obligatory application. In the recent decades, many quakes have hit the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The <b>hollow</b> <b>block</b> slab system is widely used in the residual and commercial buildings due to the variety of advantages they introduce. This study presents a performance assessment analysis of <b>hollow</b> <b>block</b> slab type R. C buildings designed as a gravity load or prior to {{the application of the}} seismic requirements of the SBC. The sample building is assumed to be located in three cities with different seismic intensities (small, medium and high). The 3 -D nonlinear pushover analysis procedure is utilized in evaluating the seismic performance of the original building. Three different retrofit techniques are proposed and analyzed. The design response spectrum suggested by the SBC for the selected cities are used in the nonlinear pushover analysis. This is along with using a real compatible earthquake in carrying out a time history analysis. A comparative quantity and cost analysis between the proposed retrofittedsystems is also carried out. It is found that the gravity load designed <b>hollow</b> <b>block</b> slab building completely fails, in many cases, from meeting the response spectrum suggested by the SBC. The three suggested retrofitting methods can highly increase both the strength and stiffness of the original building and hence its spectral acceleration. All the suggested retrofitting systems enable the original building to meet all of the applied response spectrum at reliable performance points. The study also shows how every suggested retrofitting system can upgrade the seismic behavior of the original building. Quantity and cost analysis comparison study is also carried out.
