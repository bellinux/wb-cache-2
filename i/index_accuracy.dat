On five administrative territories of Russia during a year there are recorded less than 5 new cases of malignant tumors of connective and soft tissue (Yamal-Nenets A.

To estimate dynamics of incidence of malignant tumors of connective and soft tissue {{on the basis of}} public reporting, to calculate the <b>index</b> <b>accuracy</b> and observed and relative survival rates by histological forms, including sarcomas. Material and methods. To perform a detailed study there were selected, for two periods of observation, respectively 1054 patients (1995 – 2001) and 919 patients (2002 – 2008). Estimation of survival was carried out using software, which had been developed together with Ltd. «Novel» (Director – T. L. Tsvetkova, Ph. D.). results of study. The most typical incidence rate for of malignant tumors of connective and soft tissue (S 47, 49) that are presented by  cancer registries of different countries is from 1. 5 to 2. 5 0 /   in men and 1. 5 – 2. 0 0 /   in women. Dynamics  of morbidity of the Russian population, Moscow and St. Petersburg indicates that the level of standardized  incidence rates is in the range of 2. 0 0 /   in men and within 1. 5 0 /   in women. The mortality rate in 2013  was respectively for men and women in Russia in total 1. 7 0 /   and 1. 13 0 /  , in Moscow – 1. 42 0 /   and   1. 24 0 /  , in St. Petersburg – 1. 88 0 /   and 1. 26 0 /  .

The study allowed determining, despite relatively low rates of morbidity and mortality from malignant tumors of connective and soft tissue, there was revealed a significant undercount of primary cases.

In basic part of patients with malignant tumors of connective and soft tissue there has been established positive dynamics of a 5 -year observed and relative survival but this level is lower than the European average.

We determine that the actual weight from year t- 3 data better produces a more correct chained-type producer price index at t between two available methods of selecting the weights. This weighting method also provides generally better statistical consistency and stability for the chained-type producer price index. We also compare the MAE and RMSE of the price equations of the fixed base and chain indices. Both the unit root test and comparison of the model performance evaluation reveal no critical difference, thus confirming a stability over the two indices. In particular, the substitutability of the chain index for the fixed base index is highly obtained, regardless of the time horizon.

The purpose of this thesis is the development of a software tool to model, to design, to evaluate and to simulate the optical performance of a device inspired to the architecture of the eye and which integrates two or more tunable polymer lens. This tool is tested into the modeling of a bio-inspired optical system which mimics the structure(cornea and crystalline lens) and the optical proprieties (visual acuity, dimension, accommodation process, optical power distribution between the lenses) of the human eye. Moreover, the modeled system is provided with a further degree of freedom given by a tunable polymeric ‘cornea’. The designed system is evaluated in terms of paraxial condition and primary aberration, also during the ‘accommodation process’ of the lenses.

In complex basins like the Indus Basin, water is utilized by different land cover and land uses. Up to date information about these Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classes provide essential information on the water flow path. Traditionally, landscapes are described by cover type. For water management analysis, the information on land use is vital. To this end, a classification of LULC in the Indus Basin (covering 116. 2 million hectares of Pakistan, India, China and Afghanistan) has been made. Vegetation index images freely available from SPOT-Vegetation satellite were {{used to describe the}} phenological cycle of all agro-ecosystems at a spatial resolution of 1 Â kmÂ xÂ  1 Â km. An unsupervised clustering technique was adapted to classify 27 land use classes. Ground information and expert knowledge on the growing patterns of crops was used to label the resulting LULC classes. This helped to discern specific crops and crop rotations. An error matrix was prepared using ground truthing data to evaluate the classification accuracy. Existing global, regional and local studies were also considered for validation. The results show an overall accuracy of 77 %, with the producer's accuracy being 78 % and user's accuracy 83 %. The Kappa coefficient (0. 73) shows moderate agreement between on ground and satellite derived map. This is deemed sufficient for supporting water management analysis.

40|$|This study {{developed}} an IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) compliant method for {{the estimation of}} above-ground carbon (AGC) in forest stands using remote sensing technology. A multi-level morphological active contour (MMAC) algorithm was employed to obtain tree-level metrics (tree height (LH), crown radius (LCR), competition index (LCI), and stem diameter (LDBH)) from an airborne LiDAR-derived canopy height model. Seven biomass-based AGC models and 13 volume-based AGC models were developed using a training dataset and validated using a separate validation dataset. Four accuracy measures, mean absolute error (MAE), root-mean-square error (RMSE), percentage RMSE (PRMSE), and root-mean-square percentage error (RMSPE) were calculated {{for each of the}} 20 models. These measures were transformed into a new <b>index,</b> <b>accuracy</b> improvement percentage (AIP), for post hoc testing of model performance in estimating forest stand AGC stock. Results showed that the tree-level AGC models explained 84 % to 91 % of the variance in tree-level AGC within the training dataset. Prediction errors (RMSEs) for these models ranged between 15 ton/ha and 210 ton/ha in mature forest stands, which is equal to an error percentage in the range 6 % to 86 %. At the stand-level, several models achieved accurate and reliable predictions of AGC stock. Some models achieved 90 % to 95 % accuracy, which was equal to or superior to the R-squared of the tree-level AGC models. The first recommended model was a biomass-based model using the metrics LDBH, LH, and LCI and the others were volume-based models using LH, LCI, and LCR and LDBH and LH. One metric, LCI, {{played a critical role in}} upgrading model performance when banded together with LH and LCR or LDBH and LCR.

The index consists {{of a variety of}} benthic community metrics (e. g. abundance, biomass, diversity, stress tolerance groups, etc.) scored by thresholds applied to seven benthic community habitats (tidal freshwater, oligohaline, low mesohaline, high mesohaline mud, high mesohaline sand, polyhaline mud, and polyhaline sand) This index was verified as being a sensitive and robust tool for summarizing the status of benthic communities. In our study we tested the classification efficiency of the index using new benthic data by characterizing each sample a priori as degraded or undegraded using criteria of sediment contaminant levels, bioassays and bottom dissolved oxygen levels. A primary objective of our study was to test the classification efficiency of the B-IBI in small water bodies connected to larger water bodies of the mainstems of the large rivers of Chesapeake Bay, as well as the efficiency of the index over time (1990 through 2009). The B-IBI was affected {{by the size of the}} water body, e. g., <b>index</b> <b>accuracy</b> was higher for water bodies in small watersheds in lower salinity habitats, whereas large water bodies of the mainstem of rivers were better classified by the B-IBI in habitats with higher salinities.

In general the index metrics showed some deficiencies that suggest improvements could be made by recalibrating existing metric thresholds or selecting new suitable metrics.
