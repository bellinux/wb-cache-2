50|$|Early in {{his career}} Cobham played at Woolwich, at the Navy Tavern, Glenalvon to the Young Norval of Kean. Subsequently, at the Coburg Theatre the two actors met once more, Kean playing Othello, and Cobham Iago. The {{reception}} of Kean on this occasion by the transpontine public, the faith of which in Cobham was never shaken, was unfavourable. A full account of the scene of Kean's indignation and Cobham's speech to the audience appears in Cole's Life of Charles Kean, i. 161-3. Cobham had some resemblance in appearance and stature to Kean, being dark, with <b>flexible</b> <b>features,</b> and about five feet five inches in height. In spite of Hazlitt's unfavourable verdict, he was a fair actor, a little given to rant, and to so-called and not very defensible 'new readings.' In the 'Dramatic Magazine,' ii. 210, he is placed in respect of genius above all actors of the day except Kean, Young, Macready, and Charles Kemble.|$|E
5000|$|A bronze {{statuette}} Dancing Girl is 10.5 cm {{high and}} about 4,500 years old. It {{was found in}} the [...] "HR area" [...] of Mohenjo-daro in 1926 by Ernest Mackay. Although it is in a standing position, it was named [...] "Dancing Girl" [...] with an assumption of her profession. This is one of two bronze art works found at Mohenjo-daro that show more <b>flexible</b> <b>features</b> when compared to other more formal poses. The girl is naked, wears a number of bangles and a necklace and is shown in a natural standing position with one hand on her hip. She wears 24 to 25 bangles on her left arm and 4 bangles on her right arm, and some object was held in her left hand, which is resting on her thigh; both arms are unusually long. One arm completely filled with bangles which is similar to Banjara lady. Her necklace is having three big pendents. She has her long hair styled as big bun rested on her shoulder. This statue is a cultural artifact reflecting the aesthetics of a female body as conceptualized during that historical period.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} I argue that {{syntactic}} categories {{are not part}} of UG but are acquired during first language acquisition as a result of doubling effects. In short, it is argued that a semantic operator Op F can only be (re-) analysed as a formal feature (that may yield a functional projection) if the language input exhibits doubling effects with respect to F. After providing a theoretical motivation for this hypothesis (the <b>flexible</b> formal <b>feature</b> hypothesis) I present a case study (negation and negative concord), which demonstrates that this hypothesis makes correct predictions about the syntax and semantics of (multiple) negations. I finally discuss some general consequences of the <b>flexible</b> formal <b>feature</b> hypothesis concerning clausal structure and the status of parameters. ...|$|R

40|$|Discriminative {{segmental}} models offer a way {{to incorporate}} <b>flexible</b> <b>feature</b> functions into speech recognition. However, their appeal has been limited by their computational requirements, due to {{the large number of}} possible segments to consider. Multi-pass cascades of segmental models introduce features of increasing complexity in different passes, where in each pass a segmental model rescores lattices produced by a previous (simpler) segmental model. In this paper, we explore several ways of making segmental cascades efficient and practical: reducing the feature set in the first pass, frame subsampling, and various pruning approaches. In experiments on phonetic recognition, we find that with a combination of such techniques, it is possible to maintain competitive performance while greatly reducing decoding, pruning, and training time...|$|R
