50|$|The colour of the {{sunn pest}} varies {{but it is}} usually light brown. The body is a broad oval about 12 mm long. The {{scutellum}} is wide and chitinous and covers the wings and the whole abdomen. The insect lives {{for about a month}} during which time the females lay twenty eight to forty two eggs. These are laid in batches each having two neat rows of seven eggs, on the underside of leaves and on the stems of the host plant, or sometimes on weeds. The eggs take six to twenty eight days to hatch and the nymphs moult five times while they feed on the leaves, stems and <b>ears</b> <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> crops for the next twenty to forty five days. They grow fastest at an air temperature of 20 - 24 C. The second and third instars have a pale abdomen and dark head and thorax. The fourth instar has the rudiments of fore wings and the fifth instar, the rudiments of hind wings as well.|$|R
40|$|The spatial {{arrangement}} of tissues within the <b>ears</b> <b>of</b> <b>cereals,</b> and gas exchange measurements on intact <b>ears</b> <b>of</b> barley and durum wheat suggest that respirat-ory C 02, associated with grain-filling processes, may be refixed {{close to its}} site of evolution. Apparent refixation of respiratory CO 2 in intact ears was com-pared with that in flag leaves, by feeding both organs with 14 C-labelled sucrose and trapping 14 C 02 released by respiration. Apparent refixation in the ears was twice that measured in flag leaf blades of durum wheat genotype Durelle. In <b>ears,</b> the capacity <b>of</b> refixation of respiratory CO 2 at 210 mmol mol~ 1 O 2 ranged from 55 % in barley genotype Roxana to 75 % in barley geno-type Hatif, and 60 % in durum wheat genotype Bidi 17. A low O 2 concentration increased refixation of respirat-ory CO 2 by up to 90 %, 92 % and 82 %, respectively. The occurrence of C 02 refixation in the field, {{in a set of}} 12 barley genotypes grown under irrigated and rainfed Mediterranean field conditions, was consistent with observed carbon isotope ratios (<? 13 C) of current assimilates <b>of</b> the <b>ear</b> bracts, and < 513 C of mature ker-nels whose ears had been darkened from 1 week after anthesis to maturity. Moreover, genotypic differences in < 513 C and its divergence in light compared to darkened ears were observed, both under irrigated and under rainfed conditions. If these differences reflect differences in refixation and are genotypically stable, the capacity <b>of</b> refixation by <b>ears</b> <b>of</b> respir-atory CO 2 could then be considered in breeding programmes...|$|R
40|$|Fusarium {{pathogens}} {{can cause}} <b>ear</b> blight <b>of</b> <b>cereals</b> which {{can result in}} the contamination of grain with mycotoxins. The European Commission has set maximum limits for fusarium mycotoxins in unprocessed cereals and cereal foodstuffs intended for human consumption. Legislation for deoxynivalenol and zearalenone will be introduced in July 2006. A five-year investigation was started in 2001 to assess the extent of fusarium mycotoxin contamination in UK wheat production {{and the degree to}} which agronomic factors such as variety, crop rotation, land cultivation and fungicide application could affect this contamination. Each year about 300 samples of wheat from fields of known agronomy were collected and analysed for fusarium mycotoxins, mould analysis and agronomic factors. Results from the first four years show that the incidence of mycotoxins has been generally low. Deoxynivalenol was the predominant mycotoxin found. Preliminary statistical analysis of the four year dataset shows that maize as previous crop in combination with minimum cultivation were important agronomic factors for deoxynivalenol contamination. Results from the project will be used to determine “Good Agricultural Practice ” to minimise mycotoxin contamination of wheat...|$|R
40|$|In Hesiod's calendar, circa 8 th century BCE, {{the harvest}} times <b>of</b> <b>cereals</b> were {{indicated}} by the heliacal rising of Pleiades (harvest) and by that of Orion (thresh). We tried to verify which risings and settings of the brightest stars {{could have been used}} as indicators in the previous millennia, taking into account the precession and the dependence of the heliacal dates on the latitude. In {{the second half of the}} 9 th millennium BCE there was essentially one bright star that could have been used both for the harvest (heliacal setting of the star) and for the thresh (heliacal rising of the star) : Spica, i. e. <b>ear</b> (in Latin) <b>of</b> <b>cereals.</b> According to archaeologists, the domestication of barley and wheat occurred in Near East at the end of the 9 th millennium BCE. Given the importance of the bright stars and asterisms for ancient farming activities, we have therefore proposed that the identification of the star alpha Virginis with an ear should date back to the beginning of Neolithic, possibly well before the identification of the constellation (Virgo) with a maiden.

40|$|Fusarium {{head blight}} and {{fusarium}} <b>ear</b> rot diseases <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> crops are significant global problems, causing yield and grain quality losses and accumulation of harmful mycotoxins. Safety limits {{have been set}} by the European Commission for several Fusarium-produced mycotoxins; mitigating the risk of breaching these limits is of great importance to crop producers {{as part of an}} integrated approach to disease management. This review examines current knowledge regarding the role of arthropods in disease epidemiology. In the field, diseased host plants are likely to interact with arthropods that may substantially impact the disease by influencing spread or condition of the shared host. For example, disease progress by Fusarium graminearum can be doubled if wheat plants are aphid-infested. Arthropods have been implicated in disease epidemiology in several cases and the evidence ranges from observed correlations between arthropod infestation and increased disease severity and mycotoxin accumulation, to experimental evidence for arthropod infestation causing heightened pathogen prevalence in hosts. Fusarium pathogens differ in spore production and impact on host volatile chemistry, which influences their suitability for arthropod dispersal. Herbivores may allow secondary fungal infection after wounding a plant or they may alter host susceptibility by inducing changes in plant defence pathways. Post-harvest, during storage, arthropods may also interact with Fusarium pathogens, with instances of fungivory and altered behaviour by arthropods towards volatile chemicals from infected grain. Host-mediated indirect pathogen–arthropod interactions are discussed alongside a comprehensive review of evidence for direct interactions where arthropods act as vectors for inoculum...|$|R
