5|$|Chotiner {{was given}} an office at the RNC, {{nominally}} as the official in charge of tickets for the inauguration. RNC chairman Ray Bliss and <b>his</b> <b>aides</b> were disturbed by his presence, and were told he would be gone after January 20. Meanwhile, Nixon and <b>his</b> <b>aides</b> considered a new RNC chairman finally settling on Maryland Congressman Rogers Morton, who agreed to take the position once Bliss left, though Morton was not told of the promise to Chotiner. When the President-elect met with Bliss on January 10, 1969, he could {{not bring himself to}} fire the chairman. With the situation unresolved, and Morton's appointment unannounced, Chotiner sat in his RNC office for a month after the inauguration with nothing to do, as the RNC staff wondered at his presence.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy's speech {{received}} much less attention than his (now famous) remarks in Indianapolis and was largely forgotten {{by the news}} media. Regardless, several of <b>his</b> <b>aides</b> considered it to be among his finest orations. Journalist Jack Newfield was {{of the opinion that}} the address was a suitable epitaph for the senator, who was himself assassinated two months later.|$|E
5|$|A local report {{suggested}} that this bridge was used by George Washington and two of <b>his</b> <b>aides</b> while still under construction and the timbers {{had yet to be}} secured, with Bull helping their horses across. The bridge also served as a point of refuge, particularly for Connecticut's Blue Law offenders, where once on the left bank of the river, they could easily cross to the New York border. State authorities would not go through the extradition process, leaving them safe.|$|E
50|$|According to the unwritten tradition, {{the modern}} {{name comes from}} a brigand who {{was active in the}} region around Metsovo. He used to throw his loot into a stream that led from Metsovo, and let the current carry them to the lake near Mertsi, where <b>his</b> <b>aide</b> {{gathered}} them, thus avoiding any checks by the Gendarmerie. One day however a villager saw <b>his</b> <b>aide</b> returning laden from the lake, and notified the gendarmes. They then seized the brigand, cut off his head and threw it into the stream, whereupon <b>his</b> <b>aide</b> found it in the lake.|$|R

5|$|McKinley urged <b>his</b> <b>aides</b> {{to break}} the news gently to Ida, and to call off the mob that had set on Czolgosz—a request that may have saved his assassin's life. McKinley was taken to the Exposition aid station, where the doctor was unable to locate the second bullet. Although a {{primitive}} X-ray machine was being exhibited on the Exposition grounds, it was not used. McKinley was taken to the Milburn House.|$|E
5|$|The {{legal battle}} over the tapes {{continued}} through early 1974, and in April 1974 Nixon announced the release of 1,200 pages of transcripts of White House conversations between him and <b>his</b> <b>aides.</b> The House Judiciary Committee opened impeachment hearings against the President on May 9, 1974, which were televised on the major TV networks. These hearings culminated in votes for impeachment. On July 24, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the full tapes, not just selected transcripts, must be released.|$|E
5|$|Whitlam {{returned}} to the Prime Minister's residence, The Lodge, where he had lunch. As <b>his</b> <b>aides</b> arrived, he informed them of his sacking. Whitlam drafted a resolution for the House, expressing confidence in his Government. No ALP Senate leaders were at The Lodge, nor did Whitlam and his party contact any when they drove back to Parliament House, confining their strategy to the House of Representatives.|$|E

5|$|Duyệt's death {{opened the}} way for Minh Mạng to apply his {{policies}} in the south, as the viceroy's subordinates lacked the influence to defy the court. The emperor also tried to reduce Duyệt's followers’ political power by abolishing the post of viceroy and putting the south under his direct rule, thus making Duyệt the last holder of the post. Soon after Duyệt's death, Minh Mạng's new appointees arrived and took over the local administration. The new officials then launched an investigation and reported that Duyệt and <b>his</b> <b>aides</b> had engaged in corrupt and abusive practices.|$|E
5|$|Hananu and Rashid al-Tali'a {{cooperated with}} Barakat {{in an attempt}} to unify {{northern}} Syria's rebel groups into a single resistance movement against the French, in allegiance with Faisal's government in Damascus. Hananu also formed an alliance with the semi-nomadic Mawali tribesmen of the Aleppo region. Following the battle at Harim, Hananu, with the assistance of Aleppo's Committee of National Defense, had collected up to 2,000 gold pounds in funds, and 1,700 rifles for the 680 men in his iṣābā, who he and <b>his</b> <b>aides</b> trained.|$|E

5|$|It is {{also worth}} noticing {{that in the}} early 16th century one of the houses which predated the palace hosted an osteria. In the late 1510s Raphael, at that time {{painting}} the Vatican loggias, often had lunch together with <b>his</b> <b>aides</b> in a rear room of that eatery. The artists often discussed work problems during lunch, sketching different solutions {{on the walls of the}} room. When the palace was built, the osteria remained in place, and the owners always took care of the walls of that room throughout the years.|$|E
5|$|Nixon's agenda {{had been}} impeded {{by the fact}} that Congress was {{controlled}} by Democrats and he hoped {{to take control of the}} Senate in the 1970 midterm elections. Worried that Agnew was too divisive a figure, Nixon and <b>his</b> <b>aides</b> initially planned to restrict Agnew's role to fundraising and the giving of a standard stump speech that would avoid personal attacks. The president believed that appealing to white, middle- and lower-class voters on social issues would lead to Republican victories in November. He planned not to do any active campaigning, but to remain above the fray and let Agnew campaign as spokesman for the Silent Majority.|$|E
5|$|Senator McCarthy's {{first three}} years in the Senate were unremarkable. McCarthy was a popular speaker, invited by many {{different}} organizations, covering a wide range of topics. <b>His</b> <b>aides</b> and many in the Washington social circle described him as charming and friendly, and he was a popular guest at cocktail parties. He was far less well liked among fellow senators, however, who found him quick-tempered and prone to impatience and even rage. Outside of a small circle of colleagues, he was soon an isolated figure in the Senate.|$|E

5|$|Although Roosevelt, most of <b>his</b> <b>aides,</b> Johnson, and the NRA staff {{felt the}} Act would survive a court test, the U.S. Department of Justice had on March 25, 1935, {{declined}} to appeal an appellate court ruling overturning the lumber industry code {{on the grounds}} that the case was not a good test of the NIRA's constitutionality. The Justice Department's action worried many in the administration. But on April 1, 1935 the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the constitutionality of the NIRA in the Schechter case. Although Donald Richberg and others felt the government's case in Schechter was not a strong one, the Schechters were determined to appeal their conviction. So the government appealed first, and the Supreme Court heard oral argument on May 2 and 3.|$|E
5|$|General von Toll {{initially}} {{planned to}} order his infantry {{to start the}} assault at 16:00, but Paskevich through <b>his</b> <b>aides</b> ordered him to postpone the attack until 16:45. Eventually around 5:00 von Kreutz's corps advanced towards Forts 21 and 22 in two columns. Russian horse artillery reached a position 200 paces from Fort 22 and started shelling the defenders at close range. Already shaken by the fire of the Grand Battery, the Poles abandoned the fort and retreated before the surprised Russian infantry approached. It was a rare example of artillery capturing a fortified position {{without the help of}} other forces. Meanwhile, the fighting for the nearby Fort 22 was heavy. In the end its garrison fell almost to the last man.|$|E
5|$|Hananu {{and some}} of <b>his</b> <b>aides</b> {{traveled}} to Mar'ash to request support from the Anatolian insurgents and on 7 September, he signed a deal with them in which they recognized him as {{the representative of the}} Arab government of Syria and promised military aid. In the course of that month, Hananu began receiving significant financial and military support, and military advisers, from the remnants of the Ottoman Second Army. Despite the mutual suspicion between the nationalists in Aleppo and Turkey, who were leading their respective revolts, both sides agreed that they were confronting a common French enemy. In addition, the Turkish struggle to oust French forces from Anatolia was popularly supported by Syria's inhabitants, and in northern Syria in particular, there were widespread feelings of religious solidarity with the Turks. In the second week of September, Saleh al-Ali announced that he was ready to coordinate with Hananu's rebels.|$|E

The flight, originating from Cebu, was bound for Naga, Camarines Sur when its crew declared an emergency and requested priority landing at the airport. Robredo and the two pilots died in the crash, while <b>his</b> <b>aide</b> was rescued with only minor injuries.|$|R

5|$|In May, General Gaskin began {{planning}} to retake {{the city of}} Karmah, which sat astride a main supply route between Fallujah and Baghdad and was an important insurgent stronghold. Unlike other locales, Karmah had no definable perimeter, making it easy for outsiders to access, as when insurgents fled to Karmah after being pushed out of Baghdad. Gaskin sent one of <b>his</b> <b>aides</b> to Jordan to meet with Sheikh Mishan, head of Karmah's largest tribe, the Jumayli. Sheikh Mishan fled to Jordan in 2005 after receiving threats from AQI. Gaskin's aide was able to persuade the sheikh to return in June, partnered with 2nd Battalion 5th Marines. By October, insurgent attacks had dropped to almost zero.|$|E
5|$|Nasser also {{attempted}} to maintain {{oversight of the}} country's civil service {{to prevent it from}} inflating and consequently becoming a burden to the state. New laws provided workers with a minimum wage, profit shares, free education, free health care, reduced working hours, and encouragement to participate in management. Land reforms guaranteed the security of tenant farmers, promoted agricultural growth, and reduced rural poverty. As a result of the 1962 measures, government ownership of Egyptian business reached 51percent, and the National Union was renamed the Arab Socialist Union (ASU). With these measures came more domestic repression, as thousands of Islamists were imprisoned, including dozens of military officers. Nasser's tilt toward a Soviet-style system led <b>his</b> <b>aides</b> Boghdadi and Hussein el-Shafei to submit their resignations in protest.|$|E
5|$|That evening Kennedy held a {{televised}} {{press conference on}} the possibility of a domestic Peace Corps-like program to reduce racism in white suburbs. On April 8 Kennedy and his wife went, at the request of Coretta Scott King, to Atlanta to attend Martin Luther King Jr.'s funeral. That evening he held a meeting with <b>his</b> <b>aides</b> over how {{to get the attention of}} middle-class whites weary of the civil rights movement in order to relieve the racial tension in the country. Kennedy returned to Indiana and on April 10 delivered his third and final speech inspired by King's death. Moving past his previous calls for compassion and an end to violence, he admonished whites to accept and welcome blacks into American society. Throughout the rest of the month, Kennedy toned down his campaign rhetoric and fixed on a theme of unity and reconciliation.|$|E
