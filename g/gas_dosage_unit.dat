40|$|This report {{covers a}} master thesis in Industrial Design Engineering {{conducted}} by two students at Luleå University of Technology {{during the fall}} semester of 2015. The report describes {{the development of an}} intelligent <b>dosage</b> <b>unit</b> for medication and is executed for AstraZeneca. A large amount of those who are treated with medication terminate their course of treatment prematurely, this also applies to those suffering from chronic diseases. Reasons for interrupting the medication are diverse and the consequences of it can lead to worse health, hospitalization and increased costs for the society. One way to increase the use of medications, increase adherence, may be through the pharmaceutical packaging, which forms the basis for this project. The objective of the project was to develop a concept of an intelligent pharmaceutical packaging through a literature review and a user study of the intended target group. The aim of the concept was to contribute to increased adherence. The target group of the project was initially patients with chronic diseases. To reduce the focus area, patients with diabetes type 2, were later selected as the target group. A fundamental literature study was conducted where information and research on Industrial Design Engineering, diabetes, adherence and existing intelligent pharmaceutical packaging were examined. To investigate what the user wants in a future pharmaceutical packaging a questionnaire and seven interviews were conducted. From the user study answers were received that indicated on a few specific features such as; reminders when you have forgotten to take your medication {{and to be able to}} log your use. Based on the gathered information an idea generation was initiated, resulting in a variety of ideas. From interviews with patients with diabetes type 2 it was discovered that the patients used many different medications. This formed the basis for the choice to focus on solutions concerning <b>dosage</b> <b>units.</b> The work progressed with concept development and then concept selection. From the concept selection three concepts were generated that together were developed to the final concept. The project resulted in the <b>dosage</b> <b>unit</b> "Dosea", a device for the home that will facilitate the medication for the user. Dosea consists of a base unit that can accommodate six containers, pens, which in turn can contain six different types of medications. Dosea includes a portable day <b>dosage</b> <b>unit</b> that is filled every morning and can easily be brought with during the day. The day <b>dosage</b> <b>unit</b> can also be connected to a supplied water bottle for easy access to water. Dosea is connected to an app where all the information about the disease and what medications you take are filled in. Through the app you can get reminders if you forget to take the medication, the app also stores all activity from the <b>dosage</b> <b>unit.</b> In this report Dosea is presented in two versions, a more manual and an automated. The hope with Dosea is that it will contribute to increased adherence and improved health. Validerat; 20160222 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R

However, errors during the extemporaneous manufacturing process {{can lead to}} non-homogenous drug distribution within the <b>dosage</b> <b>units.</b> To determine {{the root cause of}} these errors and provide corrective actions, we studied suppository samples prepared with exactly known errors using both cerimetric titration and HPLC technique.

This can further dilute the final suppository drug concentration causing the assay to be as low as 80 %.
