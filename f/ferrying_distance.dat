5000|$|Between 1 August 1965 and 30 June 1999 {{there was}} a ferry service between Faaborg, on Fyn in Denmark, and Germany, with ferry lines running across Gelting Bay to Gelting Pier. Since the <b>ferry</b> <b>distance</b> was 28 {{nautical}} miles and led outside the then territorial waters, the shipping company assumed a business model which, {{in addition to the}} ferry service and the management of fast restaurants and cafeterias, had a substantial sale of goods at tax-free prices. These so-called [...] "butter cruises" [...] (Butterfahrten) contributed to a tourist boom around Gelting Bay. According to a decision by the European Union (EU) to stop the duty-free sales of goods within EU countries, not only did sales on board the ferry decline, but so did the number of passengers on the so-called butter cruises. The shipping company that ran the Faaborg - Gelting Mole Line therefore discontinued the ferry service on Gelting Bay on 30 June 1999 due to its lack of profitability. Some of the technical facilities of the Gelting Mole landing stage have since been dismantled..|$|R
50|$|The Settlements {{stretched}} {{along both}} sides of the South Saskatchewan River in river lot style from Fish Creek north through Batoche and St. Laurent to St. Louis which was its northern boundary. They included Duck Lake 12 kilometers from St. Laurent accessed by the St. Laurent <b>Ferry.</b> The <b>distance</b> from Fish Creek to St. Louis was less than 50 kilometres. They were proximal to several Cree reserves, as well as Anglo-Metis settlements to the north around Prince Albert.|$|R
50|$|Fámjin is 9 km west of Øravík, {{which is}} on the west coast. Øravík is located on the east coast, around 3 km south of Krambatangi <b>ferry</b> port. The <b>{{distance}}</b> from Fámjin to Tvøroyri is 16 km. The distance from Fámjin to Vágur is 29 km.|$|R
5000|$|Lake Express is an American {{company that}} {{operates}} a seasonal ferry service across Lake Michigan between Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Muskegon, Michigan. The Milwaukee terminal {{and the company}} headquarters are located near the Port of Milwaukee. Their <b>ferry</b> travels a <b>distance</b> of 80 miles, in {{two and a half}} hours, across Lake Michigan.|$|R
5000|$|On a {{quest to}} see all fifty-four stuffed Labrador duck {{specimens}} that remain in existence for his first book The Curse of the Labrador Duck, he travelled 72,018 miles by aircraft, 5,461 miles by train, 3,566 miles by car, 1,169 miles by bus and 43 miles by <b>ferry.</b> That <b>distance</b> {{is the equivalent of}} 3.3 times around the Earth. His second book, Attack of the Killer Rhodeodendrons (a.k.a. The Last Place You'd Look for a Wallaby), which examined plants and animal species that were introduced to foreign locations by humans, took him to six continents and fourteen countries ...|$|R
60|$|They waited till midnight at Clisson, {{and then}} mounted again, and by morning they were {{within a mile}} or two of a <b>ferry,</b> a short <b>distance</b> above Nantes. They stopped at a small village, and there {{purchased}} two tricolour cockades from the one shop it boasted, these forming conspicuous objects in the window, as a proof of the warm adherence of its owner to the Convention.|$|R
50|$|In the {{beginning}} of April 2008, the Jean Nicoli was delivered to SeaFrance and renamed SeaFrance Molière. On 3 April 2008, she left Marseille for Arno Dunkerque for rebuilding into a short <b>distance</b> <b>ferry.</b> After transfer to the leasing company Sarl Poquelin Bail, she entered service with SeaFrance in freight only operation on 19 August 2008 and began passenger service on 1 September 2008.|$|R
50|$|The <b>ferry</b> crosses a <b>distance</b> {{of about}} 125 m, taking about 5 minutes. Technically, the ferry is a {{reaction}} ferry, which is propelled {{by the current}} of the water. The ferry {{is attached to a}} floating cable which is anchored firmly in the riverbed upstream of the ferry. To operate the ferry, it is angled into the current, causing the force of the current to swing the ferry across the river on the cable.|$|R
5000|$|A {{motorbike}} or bicycle {{used for}} the same purpose is a bodaboda. The term originated at the Uganda-Kenya border crossing at Busia, where a kilometre separates the downtown area from the border post on the Ugandan side. Travellers dropped off at the bus/taxi station by buses or taxis, or those coming to Uganda from the Kenya side, were <b>ferried</b> over this <b>distance</b> by enterprising cyclists, who would attract business by calling [...] "border, border".|$|R
60|$|Crossing the Sacramento on {{an old-fashioned}} <b>ferry</b> a short <b>distance</b> above Rio Vista, Saxon and Billy entered the river country. From {{the top of}} the levee she got her revelation. Beneath, lower than the river, {{stretched}} broad, flat land, {{far as the eye could}} see. Roads ran in every direction, and she saw countless farmhouses of which she had never dreamed when sailing on the lonely river a few feet the other side of the willowy fringe.|$|R
50|$|The European route E95 is a road in Europe {{and a part}} of the United Nations International E-road network. Approximately 2,527 km long, {{it connects}} St Petersburg with Merzifon in north central Turkey. Between its {{northern}} terminus in Russia and its southern end, it passes in addition through Belarus and Ukraine. Between the ports of Odessa / Chornomorsk on Ukraine's southern coast and ports of Turkey (particularly, Samsun) vehicles are required to cross the Black Sea by <b>ferry</b> over a <b>distance</b> of 731 kilometers (approximately 455 miles).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the design {{study of the}} LNG storage tank for a double-ended <b>ferry</b> operating short <b>distance</b> routes between mainland and close islands in the Greek territory. Alternative tank designs based on different structural characteristics were computationally investigated by conducting a coupled thermal-structural analysis considering steady state conditions and {{taking into account the}} applied structural and thermal loads. The tank structural stability was evaluated using von-Mises criteria. The derived results are presented and discussed concluding to the most efficient solution that provides smoother stress distribution, sufficient mechanical strength and increased bending rigidity...|$|R
5000|$|The {{route is}} {{currently}} served by car ferry shipping line Scandlines {{and a smaller}} passenger shipping line known as Sundbusserne ("The Sound Buses"). Scandlines' ferries operate more than 70 daily departures from each port, every 15 minutes {{for most of the}} day, and every 12 minutes during the peak summer weeks with an additional <b>ferry.</b> As the <b>distance</b> between Denmark and Sweden here only is around 2.5 nautical miles (approx. 4 km), the crossing time is just 20 minutes. While Sundbusserne, currently (as of January 2015) departs every hour with their only [...] "bus".|$|R
50|$|In year 2012, the 10.4 km long Jondal Tunnel {{was built}} a short {{distance}} from this tunnel. Using these two tunnels and a <b>ferry,</b> the road <b>distance</b> between the E134 highway in Odda municipality and the city of Bergen is much shorter than before. Using this route to travel from Oslo to Bergen is shorter than taking the E16 highway, and this route is much less sensitive to snow storms in the winter (which is fairly long in the mountains) than by taking Norwegian National Road 7 (which is the shortest route between Oslo and Bergen).|$|R
5|$|According to Japanese weather officials, heavy rain, flood, {{storm and}} high wave {{warnings}} {{were put into}} effect for all of Kyūshū and adjacent areas in Honshū. The two largest air carriers in Japan, Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways, cancelled at least 36 domestic flights ahead of the storm. Several of the largest oil refineries halted oil product shipments from three refineries. Kyushu Railways postponed services on five lines, one of which crossed the entire prefecture. Long <b>distance</b> <b>ferries</b> were also shut down. Iwakuni, Yamaguchi was placed under Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness 3 and Sasebo, Nagasaki was placed under Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness Storm Watch.|$|R
50|$|The {{alternative}} North American term trolley may {{strictly speaking}} be considered incorrect, as the term {{can also be}} applied to cable cars, or conduit cars that instead draw power from an underground supply. Conventional diesel tourist buses decorated to look like streetcars are sometimes called trolleys in the US (tourist trolley). Furthering confusion, the term tram has instead been applied to open-sided, low-speed segmented vehicles on rubber tires generally used to <b>ferry</b> tourists short <b>distances,</b> for example on the Universal Studios backlot tour and, in many countries, as tourist transport to major destinations. The term may also apply to an aerial ropeway, e.g. the Roosevelt Island Tramway.|$|R
2500|$|A Philippine pedicab {{is called}} a traysikad, trisikad [...] or simply sikad or padyak, from the Philippine word meaning to tramp or stamp one's feet. [...] It is made by {{mounting}} a sidecar to a regular bicycle. They are used mainly to <b>ferry</b> passengers short <b>distances</b> along smaller, more residential streets, often to or from jeepneys or other public utility vehicles. [...] They are also used for transporting cargo too heavy to carry by hand and over a distance too short or roads too congested for motor transport, such as a live pig. During rainy seasons, they are useful {{as a way to}} avoid walking through flood waters. [...] Along with the jeepney, the motorcycle-powered tricycle, and the engine-powered kuliglig, the open-air pedicab provides shade when needed.|$|R
50|$|Martha's Vineyard {{is located}} {{approximately}} seven {{miles off the}} southern coast of Cape Cod. It is reached by a ferry that departs from Woods Hole, Massachusetts, and by several other ferries departing from Falmouth, New Bedford, Hyannis, Quonset Point, Rhode Island, and the East 35th Street ferry terminal in Manhattan. The Steamship Authority operates most of the shorter routes, while other, smaller ferry services run faster, longer <b>distance</b> <b>ferries</b> to Rhode Island and Hyannis. There are direct ferries to each place. SeaStreak operates the seasonal, weekend New York City to Martha's Vineyard route. One ferry departs New York City on Friday afternoon and returns on Sunday night. The trip through Long Island Sound and along the shoreline of Rhode Island and Massachusetts takes about {{four and a half}} hours (270 minutes).|$|R
5000|$|The <b>ferry</b> travels a <b>distance</b> of 110 yards, {{shore to}} shore, with a travel time of five minutes, has a maximum {{capacity}} of two cars or four tons by weight, operates without a toll, and operates daily, providing service from 6AM to 6PM, Spring and Summer, and from sunrise to sunset in the Winter and Fall. [...] There is no ferry service on Christmas Day or on days of high water or storm conditions. Vehicles arriving {{on the opposite}} shore from the ferry, summon the ferry by blowing their horn. Ferry traffic averages 60 to 80 vehicles daily.The inland cable ferries located in North Carolina are operated by regional DOT divisional offices rather than the North Carolina Department of Transportation Ferry Division, with the Elwell Ferry operated by private contract with DOT Division 6. There are no plans to replace the Elwell Ferry with a bridge, which would likely cost more than the service for the secondary road would justify.|$|R
6000|$|We {{walked from}} the Park home to Rock <b>Ferry,</b> a <b>distance</b> {{of three or four}} miles,--a part of which was made {{delightful}} by a foot-path, leading us through fields where the grass had just been mown, and others where the wheat harvest was commenced. The path led us into the very midst of the rural labor that was going forward; and the laborers rested a moment to look at us; in fact, they seemed to be more willing to rest than American laborers would have been. Children were loitering along this path or sitting down beside it; and we met one little maid, passing from village to village, intent on some errand. Reaching Tranmere, I went into an alehouse, nearly opposite the Hall, and called for a glass of ale. The doorstep before the house, and the flagstone floor of the entry and tap-room, were chalked all over in corkscrew lines,--an adornment that gave an impression of care and neatness, the chalked lines being evidently freshly made. It was a low, old-fashioned room ornamented with a couple of sea-shells, and an earthen-ware figure on the mantel-piece; also with advertisements of Allsop's ale, and other drinks, and with a pasteboard handbill of [...] "The Ancient Order of Foresters"; any member of which, paying sixpence weekly, is entitled to ten shillings per week, and the attendance of a first-rate physician in sickness, and twelve pounds to be paid to his friends in case of death. Any member of this order, when travelling, is sure (says the handbill) to meet with a brother member to lend him a helping hand, there being nearly three thousand districts of this order, and more than a hundred and nine thousand members in Great Britain, whence it has extended to Australia, America, and other countries.|$|R
40|$|Because of the {{environmental}} pressure concerning both global and local pollution new ways of using energy are under study. Given that the Norwegian transport sector is a significant contributor to those pollutions at the national scale, the hydrogen and fuel cells technology is a potential solution thanks to its eco-friendly properties. This technology that allows transforming hydrogen and oxygen into electricity has many advantages but has also a cost, some drawbacks {{and has to be}} introduced properly in the transport market to insure the success of the energetic transition. By collecting information about existing projects and competitive fuels (diesel, battery, hydrogen and associated technologies) and by using the total cost of ownership as a comparative tool, the most relevant market segments to introduce fuel cells and hydrogen have been determined. This fuel comparison has been completed on a ferry, a light truck, a heavy truck and a car while other sectors have been covered more briefly. It appears that hydrogen has a significant advantage over batteries for medium and long distance trips as well as high energy consumption vehicles like heavy trucks. This advantage can even compete with diesel cars or light diesel trucks thanks to the Norwegian road tax exemption. However those applications are currently limited to captive fleet operation {{because of the lack of}} refueling infrastructure network. It has also been determined that, in the maritime sector, fuel cells are competitive with battery <b>ferries</b> for <b>distances</b> longer than 11. 5 km. A simplified life cycle assessment also allows us to state that in addition to bring an undisputable CO 2 emission reduction the replacement of diesel vehicle by a fuel cells vehicle also generates significant energy saving whatever the value chain used...|$|R
