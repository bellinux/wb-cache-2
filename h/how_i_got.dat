25|$|The album debuted {{at number}} six on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 51,000 copies {{in its first}} week. <b>How</b> <b>I</b> <b>Got</b> Over {{received}} universal acclaim from music critics, several of whom named {{it one of the}} best albums of 2010.|$|E
3000|$|... “In the end, I can roughly judge <b>how</b> much <b>I</b> know, <b>how</b> much <b>I</b> <b>got</b> right, <b>how</b> much <b>I</b> <b>got</b> wrong, what <b>I</b> <b>got</b> right, what <b>I</b> <b>got</b> wrong. <b>I</b> don’t {{think that}} score is {{important}} (Mathematics student 7).” [...]...|$|R
60|$|I {{told him}} of my new situation, and <b>how</b> <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> it. He listened with evident interest.|$|R

25|$|She {{would bring}} home those 78 vinyl RPMs {{and when my}} father was at work, she would play them. That was <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> exposed to jazz music... {{basically}} listening to Dinah Washington, Billie Holiday, and Frank Sinatra. But also a lot of piano players, such as Bill Evans, Oscar Peterson and Erroll Garner, those were my mother's favorites.|$|E
25|$|Her {{career as}} a film actress began in the mid-1990s with minor roles in films like Philippe Harel's The Story of a Boy Who Wanted to Be Kissed, which was her feature film debut {{at the age of}} 18; in Arnaud Desplechin's My Sex Life... or <b>How</b> <b>I</b> <b>Got</b> into an Argument, and the comedy La Belle Verte, {{directed}} by Coline Serreau.|$|E
60|$|He looked up, {{and asked}} me <b>how</b> <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> on with Dingaan, not being sorry, as I think, of an excuse to pause in his {{clerical}} labours.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, good-bye,' Murdoch said. 'I am off by {{the boat}} to-morrow. I will look you up if I come back this way, and let you know <b>how</b> <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> on.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If--nonsense. I {{tell you}} he will be quite well enough. See <b>how</b> well <b>I</b> am now, <b>how</b> fast <b>I</b> <b>got</b> on as soon as I took to tonics.--Ha, Leonard, old fellow! what, awake? What {{do you say to}} this plan of old May's?' ...|$|R
25|$|One day for {{the march}} I {{received}} this heavy old gun. A gun? And during a war? Never, I thought to myself. And leaned it against a hut. And walked away. But that stood out even in our group at that time. I don't know now <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> away with it, but somehow it worked. And so I got by unarmed.|$|E
25|$|Undun is {{an existential}} concept album about the fictional {{character}} Redford Stevens, who {{is named after}} a Sufjan Stevens song. Its reverse-chronological narrative discusses his short, tragic life set in urban poverty. Expanding on the indie influence of the band's <b>How</b> <b>I</b> <b>Got</b> Over (2010), the album's music is characterized by snare-driven beats, neo soul elements, keyboard soundscapes, strings, choral arrangements, and tight dynamics.|$|E
25|$|<b>How</b> <b>I</b> <b>Got</b> Over is {{the ninth}} studio album by American hip hop band The Roots, {{released}} June 22, 2010 on Def Jam Recordings. It was produced primarily by band members Black Thought, Questlove, Dice Raw, and Rick Friedrich. The album has a subtle, somber sound and features lyrics concerning themes of existentialism, perseverance, and modern society. A hip hop album, its music also draws on indie rock, soul, funk, gospel, and neo soul styles.|$|E
60|$|I think I said I {{felt all}} right. I could not {{recollect}} <b>how</b> <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> there. He {{must have seen}} the question in my face, for my voice was inaccessible to me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will see}} what I can do," [...] he said quietly. [...] "Some of these {{accounts}} should certainly be recovered. I will come down and let you know <b>how</b> <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'm glad as <b>how</b> <b>I</b> ain't <b>got</b> no {{bad news}} to tell you," [...] {{said the old}} sailor with a grin. [...] "Tom Clover is upstairs, in his right mind, and wants to see you." ...|$|R
25|$|Philbin is also {{an author}} and singer. His two autobiographies (with {{co-author}} Bill Zehme), I'm Only One Man! (1995) and Who Wants To Be Me? (2000), are written in the conversational or anecdotal style of his host chats. The former book follows a year (19941995) in his life recalling his personal life, his memories with celebrities, and work on Live with Regis and Kathie Lee, among other things. The latter book {{was a response to}} the success of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and deals with the show and his life. In 2011, upon leaving Live!, Philbin released a memoir titled <b>How</b> <b>I</b> <b>Got</b> This Way.|$|E
500|$|Initially, Garland was {{enrolled}} at Delaware Valley Charter School, which was located {{only half a}} mile from his future college, La Salle University. However, his cousin Donnel Feaster, an alumnus of John Bartram High School, recommended that Garland attend his alma mater. The team's head coach, James Brown, said, [...] "I'm always telling my ex-players, 'If you see any good ones, send them my way'...Not that they listen. Don did, though. That's <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> Ty".|$|E
500|$|It {{describes}} <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> {{into the}} business, verbatim. I did {{grow up in}} a small town, I wanted to get out, I felt like there was something... not better for me, but something different for me. I didn't feel like I fit in at school. Whether you are a DJ, or if you work with computers, or if you're a teacher, everyone has that point where they feel, 'I'm bored and this isn't what I wanted to do with my life.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dare, it's {{better for}} him--and Mel too," [...] said Blair, {{with a hand}} going to his friend's shoulder. [...] "That idea never {{occurred}} to me until day before yesterday when I ran into Mel. She looked--Oh, I can't tell you <b>how.</b> But <b>I</b> <b>got</b> that strange impression." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{know you}} did," [...] he replied. [...] "But I've disobeyed you. I {{wanted to see}} you, Mel.... <b>I</b> didn't know <b>how</b> badly until <b>I</b> <b>got</b> here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a {{very long}} while since <b>I</b> <b>got</b> up so late, and I don't quite know <b>how</b> <b>I</b> came to be lying here," [...] he said. [...] "I suppose I fell asleep beside the fire, but in that case it's a little {{difficult}} to understand <b>how</b> <b>I</b> could have <b>got</b> the blanket and tucked myself in." ...|$|R
500|$|Field {{went public}} about his {{experience}} with clinical depression in mid-2007 to draw {{more attention to the}} condition. He has stated that [...] "being on the road is a dangerous job for someone with depression," [...] but has dealt with it through diet, exercise, talking about it, and having a good support system (including his father before his death in 1998, his wife, and his friend Murray Cook). He chronicled his health struggles and how he overcame them in his 2012 book <b>How</b> <b>I</b> <b>Got</b> My Wiggle Back.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, Madonna pleads the {{listener}} {{to stop for}} a moment, {{to get away from}} the world through music, with the lines going as: [...] "I don't know <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to this stage / Let me out of my cage cause I'm dying / Turn up the radio, turn up the radio / Don't ask me where I wanna go, we gotta turn up the radio." [...] During the intermediate verses, Madonna sings about making speakers blow, which is accompanied by a subtle sound of an actual speaker blowing up. It also talks about the need to relax as well as the need to have fun. According to NMEs Priya Elan, [...] "the song continues [...] career-spanning themes of getting into the groove, of uniting the bourgeoisie and rebelling." [...] O'Mancey gave a detailed analysis of the lyrics: ...|$|E
500|$|Ryan White {{was seen}} by some as an [...] "innocent victim" [...] of the AIDS epidemic. Ryan White and his family {{strongly}} rejected the language of [...] "innocent victim" [...] because the phrase was often used to imply that gays with AIDS were [...] "guilty". Ryan's mother told The New York Times, Ryan always said, 'I'm {{just like everyone else}} with AIDS, no matter <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> it.' And he would never have lived as long as he did without the gay community. The people we knew in New York made sure we knew about the latest treatments way before we would have known in Indiana. I hear mothers today say they're not gonna work with no gay community on anything. Well, if it comes to your son's life, you better start changing your heart and your attitude around.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> {{told him}} <b>how</b> <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> {{in at the}} second-floor window, without concealing a word of the truth. The gravity of the situation, and the {{sharpness}} of the doctor's intellects, as expressed in his eyes, made anything like a suppression of facts on my part a desperately dangerous experiment.|$|R
5000|$|... "I can't {{possibly}} quantify <b>how</b> much publicity <b>I</b> <b>got</b> {{from that}} or <b>how</b> much money <b>I</b> made. And now, every time anyone writes about her {{they use the}} picture {{of her in the}} dress and so it just goes on and on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{mean what}} I say. Why should I care? Five years ago I had a foolish dream, and now I am awake again. Think <b>how</b> old <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> to be!" ...|$|R
500|$|As he {{had worked}} with Sellers, he also came to know Spike Milligan, with whom he became a firm friend, and best man at Milligan's second marriage: [...] "I loved The Goon Show, and issued an album of it on my label Parlophone, which is <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to know Spike." [...] The album was Bridge on the River Wye. It was a spoof of the film The Bridge on the River Kwai, being based on the 1957 Goon Show episode [...] "An African Incident." [...] It was {{intended}} {{to have the same}} name as the film, but shortly before its release, the film company threatened legal action if the name was used. Martin edited out the 'K' every time the word Kwai was spoken, with Bridge on the River Wye being the result. The River Wye is a river that runs through England and Wales. The album featured Milligan, Sellers, Jonathan Miller, and Peter Cook, playing various characters.|$|E
500|$|Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters is {{the first}} English {{language}} film and the first big studio production of Norwegian writer and director Wirkola, {{up to this point}} best known for his 2009 Nazi zombie-themed, independent horror comedy film Dead Snow. Wirkola said he was contacted by producer Kevin Messick from Gary Sanchez Productions after the screening of Dead Snow at the Sundance Film Festival: [...] "So my first meeting, my first day in LA was with those guys and I pitched Hansel and Gretel and they loved it. And they took me to Paramount two days after and we sold it." [...] In 2013, Wirkola commented, [...] "I’m still surprised that they went for it, because it’s a crazy, rock n’ roll script. It’s full throttle, there’s lots of blood and gore and bad language, I often wonder <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> this movie made. It’s all across the world now. But people really seem to respond to it, which is what we hoped, that people would enjoy this ride." ...|$|E
500|$|Mr. McClure tried {{three men}} on this disagreeable task, {{but none of}} them did it very well, so a month ago it was thrust upon me. You may imagine me {{wandering}} around the country grubbing among newspaper files and court records for the next five months. It is the most laborious and sordid work I have ever come upon, and it takes every hour of my time and as much vitality as I can put into it. ... You can't know, never having done it, how such work does sap your poor brain and wring it dry of anything you'd like to pretend was there. I jump about like a squirrel in a cage and wonder <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> here and why I am doing it. I never in my life wanted to do this sort of thing. I have a clean conscience on that score. Then why am I hammering away at it, I'd like to know? I often wonder whether I shall ever write another line of anything I care to.|$|E
6000|$|... "But, sah," [...] said Grandison one {{day when}} these {{objections}} had been placed before him, [...] "I's been turnin' dis thing ober in my min' ober an' ober. <b>I</b> know jes' <b>how</b> much <b>I</b> kin make an' <b>how</b> much <b>I's</b> <b>got</b> to spend an' <b>how</b> <b>I</b> kin save ter buy the house, an' if I agree to pay you so much money on such a day an' so much on such anudder day I's gwine ter do it. You kin jes' put that down, sah, for sartin shuh." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ay! I wished I {{could have}} {{let you know}} sooner <b>how</b> well <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> over it,' said Harry, in the deep full voice of strong healthy manhood. 'I am afraid you have been very anxious.' ...|$|R
3000|$|It {{makes me}} anxious because there’s {{so many things}} written on the {{criteria}} and sometimes, the words are too vague. There’s a grade range, right, and then the description, but then sometimes, you get the lowest grade for that range and then, I don’t understand because the grade range, you know the description satisfies the grade range but <b>how</b> come <b>I</b> <b>got</b> the low…? <b>I</b> don’t get it. (Student # 9) [...]...|$|R
