5|$|The {{quarries}} and mines made {{increasing use of}} mechanization {{from the}} start of the 20th century, with electricity replacing steam and water as a power source. The Llechwedd Quarry introduced its first electrical plant in 1891, and in 1906, a <b>hydro-electric</b> <b>plant</b> was opened in Cwm Dyli, on the lower slopes of Snowdon, which supplied electricity to the largest quarries in the area. The use of electric saws and other machinery reduced the hard manual labour involved in extracting the slate, but produced much more slate dust than the old manual methods, leading to an increased incidence of silicosis. The work was also dangerous in other ways, with the blasting operations responsible for many deaths. A government enquiry in 1893 found that the death rate for underground workers in the slate mines was 3.23 per thousand, higher than the rate for coal miners.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1940s the Indiana and Michigan Electric Company {{purchased}} the rights along the East Race canal and began filling it in around 1954. In 1973 the Oliver Chilled Plow Works <b>hydro-electric</b> <b>plant</b> was demolished {{to make room}} for the construction of the Century Center which was completed in 1977. Currently the West Race still exists as a canal North of Jefferson Boulevard and South of Colfax Avenue on the banks of Century Center between Pier Park and Island Park. In the early 1980s, the East Race canal was re-excavated and turned into a man made whitewater kayaking course known as the East Race Waterway.|$|E

[...] The property is {{on the east side of}} Route 97 in an area where the Pilot Butte Canal runs close to the highway. [...] The Oregon Central Oregon Irrigation District subsequently built a small <b>hydro-electric</b> <b>plant</b> on the property, utilizing the water flow in the canal to generate electricity. [...] The plant now produces enough electricity to power 4,000 central Oregon homes.|$|E

50|$|Like all hydro-electric power, run-of-the-river hydro {{harnesses}} {{the natural}} potential energy of water, {{eliminating the need}} to burn coal or natural gas to generate the electricity needed by consumers and industry. Moreover, run-of-the-river <b>hydro-electric</b> <b>plants</b> do not require {{the formation of a}} reservoir (unlike conventional <b>hydro-electric</b> <b>plants)</b> thus eliminating the methane and carbon dioxide emissions generally caused by the decomposition of organic matter in the reservoir of a hydro-electric dam.|$|R

2500|$|The first {{practical}} AC {{electric locomotive}} {{was designed by}} Charles Brown, then working for Oerlikon, Zürich. In 1891, Brown had demonstrated long-distance power transmission, using three-phase AC, between a <b>hydro-electric</b> <b>plant</b> at Lauffen am Neckar and Frankfurt am Main West, a distance of 280km. Using experience he had gained while working for Jean Heilmann on steam-electric locomotive designs, Brown observed that three-phase motors had a higher power-to-weight ratio than DC motors and, because {{of the absence of}} a commutator, were simpler to manufacture and maintain. [...] However, they were much larger than the DC motors of the time and could not be mounted in underfloor bogies: they could only be carried within locomotive bodies.|$|E
2500|$|The Crystal Falls Dam and Power Plant is {{a utility}} {{located on the}} Paint River off Powerplant Road. The section of the Paint River where the dam is now located was once a series of falls and rapids that gave Crystal Falls its name. [...] In 1891, the village of Crystal Falls {{constructed}} the Crystal Falls dam and power plant, effectively submerging the rapids. [...] In 1902-1903, a new power plant was constructed. [...] The plant was expanded in 1907, and new generators were installed in 1914 and 1924. [...] The plant was expanded several times, including a 1931 installation of a new concrete dam installed containing the rollway and tainter gates and a 1996 resurfacing of the spillway. The Crystal Falls Power Plant is still operational, and is likely the oldest <b>hydro-electric</b> <b>plant</b> still in operation in the Upper Peninsula. [...] It provides roughly 1/3 of the power demanded by the residents of Crystal Falls.|$|E
2500|$|To {{operate the}} quarries, {{structures}} for various functions were {{built around the}} quarry exterior. [...] Wooden derricks were located by and above the openings to lift blocks out of the quarries. [...] The boiler house (providing steam power for quarrying equipment) was the last major addition (second building {{to the right of}} opening 2). In front of the boiler house is a 50-ton (49.875 metric ton) electric hoist and the hoist electric power house is {{to the right of the}} boiler house. Below the boiler house area near the bottom of the photo is the Pea Vine (winch-cable powered carts on rails) used to move marble from the quarry to the loading station several hundred feet away, where it was placed on wagons for transport to the mill site. [...] There are other facilities to the right of opening 1; compressor house, machine shop, and bunk house. [...] To provide the needed electricity, the company built a <b>hydro-electric</b> <b>plant</b> with the generators located just east of the town limits and completed in July 1907.|$|E

2500|$|Once {{out of the}} quarry, a {{block was}} moved to a loading station for {{transport}} to the mill site. [...] The first method (1906 through 1909) used the 50-ton electric hoist, which lowered the block down and onto a Pea Vine cable-powered cart. The cart then moved on rails with downgrades to 54% to a loading station where the block was transferred to a wagon for towing to the mill site. [...] The wagons were first towed by teams of four horses then in 1908 by a 110-horsepower steam tractor previously used for logging. [...] The road to the mill site {{was built in the}} 1890s by John Osgood to his quarry, which was just below the CYMC started quarry. [...] By 1910, the method changed with the 50-ton hoist attaching a block to an overhead cable for lowering [...] to a new loading station. [...] Here the block was placed on a flatcar for towing by an electric tram (designed by General Electric) on standard-gauge railroad track to the town of Marble and into the mill site. [...] Electricity to power the tram came from the CYMC-built <b>hydro-electric</b> <b>plant</b> located just east of the town.|$|E
