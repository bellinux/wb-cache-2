6000|$|On the {{following}} morning the dean rode over to Hogglestock, and as he drew near {{to the house of}} his old friend, his spirits flagged,--for to tell the truth, he dreaded the meeting. Since the day on which he had brought Mr. Crawley from a curacy in Cornwall into the diocese of Barchester, his friend had been a trouble to him rather than a joy. The trouble had been a trouble of spirit altogether,--not at all of pocket. He would willingly have picked the Crawleys out from the pecuniary mud into which they were ever <b>falling,</b> <b>time</b> after time, had it been possible. For, though the dean was hardly to be called a rich man, his lines had fallen to him not only in pleasant places, but in easy circumstances;--and Mr. Crawley's embarrassments, though overwhelming to him, were not so great as to have been heavy to the dean. But in striving to do this he had always failed, had always suffered, and had generally been rebuked. Crawley would attempt to argue with him as to the improper allotment of Church endowments,--declaring that he did not do so with any reference to his own circumstances, but simply because the subject was one naturally interesting to clergymen. And this he would do, as he was waving off with his hand offers of immediate assistance which were indispensable. Then there had been scenes between the dean and Mrs. Crawley,--terribly painful,--and which had taken place in direct disobedience to the husband's positive injunctions. [...] "Sir," [...] he had once said to the dean, [...] "I request that nothing may pass from your hands to the hands of my wife." [...] "Tush, tush," [...] the dean had answered. [...] "I will have no tushing or pshawing on such a matter. A man's wife is his very own, the breath of his nostril, the blood of his heart, the rib from his body. It is for me to rule my wife, and I tell you that I will not have it." [...] After that the gifts had come from the hands of Mrs. Arabin;--and then again, after that, in the direst hour of his need, Crawley had himself come and taken money from the dean's hands! The interview had been so painful that Arabin would hardly have been able to count the money or to know of what it had consisted, had he taken the notes and cheque out of the envelope in which his wife had put them. Since that day the two had not met each other, and since that day these new troubles had come. Arabin as yet knew but little of {{the manner in which they}} had been borne, except that Crawley had felt himself compelled to resign the living of Hogglestock. He knew nothing of Mrs. Proudie's persecution, except what he gathered from the fact of the clerical commission of which he had been informed; but he could imagine that Mrs. Proudie would not lie easy on her bed while a clergyman was doing duty almost under her nose, who was guilty of the double offence of being accused of a theft, and of having been put into his living by the dean. The dean, therefore, as he rode on, pictured to himself his old friend in a terrible condition. And it might be that even now that condition would hardly have been improved. He was no longer suspected of being a thief; but he could have no money in his pocket; and it might well be that his sufferings would have made him almost mad.|$|E

50|$|Some anarchists reject {{institutions}} such as interest, rent, and profit as being intrusive and exploitative, and thus {{they believe that they}} should be abolished. They maintain that such institutions were made possible, in part, by state restrictions on banking and currency issuance as well as titles to land, and by vast accumulations of wealth which arise in capitalism and interfere with the free economy. Anarcho-capitalists do not believe that interest, rent, or profit are exploitative, arguing they are compatible with free markets, and claiming these institutions would prevail without government interference. However, like individualist anarchists, some anarcho-capitalists believe that in a free market, interest rates would substantially fall, but more due to <b>falling</b> <b>time</b> preference.|$|E

The switching frequency of them is controlled over 48 kHz. The high-frequency noise due to the switching of the IGBT choppers has caused the damages to the control system. Furthermore, the capacitors for the RF shield of the ceramics chamber inside the BUHS have been burned by the induced voltage due to the fast <b>falling</b> <b>time</b> of the current pattern and the current ripple of the high frequency. The ground wires that connect to each power supply panel and each magnet has been changed to copper sheets and the neutral ground (ME) resistor of the IGBT assemblies have been installed.

40|$|The {{degradation}} {{characteristics of}} n-channel low temperature poly-Si thin film transistors (LTPS TFTs), which are alternately stressed in OFF region with drain positively biased and source grounded, are investigated. In this research, rectangular pulse signals, dynamically changing from 18 to 0 V with varied parameters such as rising time, <b>falling</b> <b>time,</b> and frequency, {{are applied to}} the gate terminal, and the drain is simultaneously biased at + 5 V to stress the LTPS TFTs and examined the deterioration. It is observed that the degradation strongly depends on the frequency and rising time rather than the <b>falling</b> <b>time</b> of AC signals. As the gate voltage transitionally changes in the rising period, the accumulated holes should be swept out and flow into the source terminal, resulting from the drain with positively biased and the floating body structure of TFTs. A degradation model of the parasitic BJT, based on the flowing direction of a sampling current Id, is proposed to explain the degradation mechanism of LTPS TFTs, and demonstrated by two electrical measurements, C–V curves and saturated forward and reverse Id–Vg transfer curves...|$|E

40|$|Accurate {{measurement}} of the viscosity of fuels {{is essential for the}} proper operation of fuel supply systems and atomisers. In previous years, the use of fuels derived from the fast pyrolysis of biomass (bio-oils) has been demonstrated in, for example, furnace applications. Unfortunately, these fuels are shown to be unstable and start to polymerise even at ambient conditions. At elevated temperatures, these degradation phenomena become even more significant and complex. For example, vapours will be formed, not only due to the presence of volatiles and water in the oil, but also because of the decomposition of the oil. These vapours make the viscosity measurement troublesome. In the present paper, a procedure is proposed for the determination of the viscosity of such (unstable) bio-oils. First, by varying the sample temperature, the so-called decomposition temperature, at which the formation of vapours starts, should be determined. Below that decomposition temperature, the standard procedure for viscosity measurement can be applied. At temperatures above this temperature, the appearance of vapours results in a significant increase and strong fluctuations in the <b>falling</b> <b>time</b> of the ball due to the formation of bubbles. At these latter temperatures, values for the viscosity should be calculated from the lowest value of the <b>falling</b> <b>time</b> during the so-called heat-up period and the vapour formation delay. The values for the viscosity for five types of bio-oils, derived in this way, were shown to be reliable...|$|E
