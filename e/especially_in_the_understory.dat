40|$|The Pacific Silver fir forests {{described}} in this PNVG occur at upper elevations within the Pacific Silver fir zone (800 - 1100 meters <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North, 1800 - 2000 meters <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south). These forests are cool and moist, and typically have a heavy snowpack and a late snow-melt. Vegetation Description Pacific Silver fir is the dominant and climax tree species <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mature canopy, which it shares with Lodgepole pine, White pine, Mountain hemlock and Alaska Yellow-cedar (<b>especially</b> <b>in</b> Washington). <b>The</b> <b>understory</b> is predominantly composed of a well developed layer of heath shrubs (Vaccinium, Menziesia, Gaultheria, Chimaphila, Rhododendron and Pyrola) and lush herbs and moss (e. g. Cornus canadensis, Clintonia uniflora, Linnaea borealis, and Tiarella unifoliata). Disturbance Description The fire regime for this PNVG is characterized by infrequent fires occurring at approximately 500 year intervals. These events were of high severity and large extent, resetting 1000 's of acres through stand-replacement fire. Avalanches and blowdown are also common disturbances. Adjacency or Identification Concerns This high elevation Pacific Silver fir PNVG occurs below the Mountain hemlock forest type. This PNVG is distinguished from the low elevation Pacific Silver Fir type (R#ABAMlw) by elevation breaks: the high elevation type occurs above 800 m <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north and 1800 m <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south...|$|R

Environmental {{heterogeneity}} mostly {{dominated by}} differing light regimes affects {{the expression of}} phenotypic plasticity, which is important for plant growth and survival, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> forest <b>understory.</b> <b>The</b> knowledge about these responses to this heterogene-ity is a key factor for forest restoration initiatives. in this study, we determine several phenotypic responses to contrasting light conditions in five native tree seedling species of La Cangreja National Park, Central Pacific of Costa Rica, four of them with threatened or relict populations. After 14 weeks at a medium gap condition (24 % of full sun), seedlings were transferred and acclimated for 11 weeks to three different natural light regimes: large gap (LG), medium gap (MG) and small gap (SG), corresponding to 52 %, 24 %, 9 % of the mean direct and indi-rect radiation at each site from full sun.

In this study, we determine several phenotypic responses to contrasting light conditions in five native tree seedling species of La Cangreja National Park, Central Pacific of Costa Rica, four of them with threatened or relict populations.

Growth, biomass allocation and leaf gas exchange were measured after the acclimation period. Four species strongly reduced relative growth rate (RGR) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower light condition.

This study remarks the importance of determining the growth and physiological performance of these tree native species. It also demonstrates that the most threatened species are those with the less plastic responses to the light regimes, which stresses the difficult situation of their natural populations. This study highlights an urgent definition of the conservation and restoration needs of the degraded forests of the Costa Rican Central Pacific area, where these species dwell...|$|R
