40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an attempt}} at explaining and analyzing capital flight from Southeast Asia over the period 1970 to 2002. The research is organized into five questions. The first question is: What is capital flight? We review {{the literature on the}} meanings and measurements of capital flight. We define capital flight as the movement of capital from resource-scarce developing countries in order to avoid social control. The second question is: Was capital fleeing Southeast Asia? We employ a modified residual method to estimate capital flight. We measure capital flight as net unrecorded capital outflow, or the net of officially recorded capital inflows and recorded <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>outflows.</b> The third question is: Why was capital fleeing Southeast Asia? We examine direct and indirect linkages between capital flight and external borrowing, using a 2 ̆ 7 revolving door 2 ̆ 7 model, and other exogenous variables. The fourth question is: Should Southeast Asia worry about capital flight? We deal with a counterfactual situation, using a planning method and a multiplier method: if there was no capital flight and the capital was utilized in productive domestic activities, how much additional output and employment would have been generated? The last question is: What is to be done to address capital flight? We discuss some policy guidelines to restrain, reduce, and reverse capital flight. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} volume, nature, direction and determinants of capital flight and FDI in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region {{in relation to}} certain structural and institutional characteristics. The {{results show that the}} resource-based economies of region have experienced large amounts of capital flight in the form of unrecorded <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>outflows</b> and are among the least recipients of FDI relative to market size in comparison to other developing countries. In contrast, the resource-poor countries of the region have experienced large net unrecorded foreign exchange inflows, driven mostly by import underinvoicing, and receive less FDI than their potentiality suggests empirically and in comparison to other developing countries. However, they receive more FDI as a percentage of GDP than the resource-based countries of MENA. In addition, the determinants of each type of capital differ according to whether a MENA country is a resource-based or not. For example, higher level of development increases capital flight but reduces FDI in the resource-rich countries. In contrast, it increases unrecorded foreign exchange inflows but is insignificant to FDI in the resource-poor countries of the region. Interestingly, capital flight is shown to be an outcome of increasing control of domestic authorities in the resource-rich countries, while increasing control of domestic authorities in the resource-poor economies induces unrecorded inflows to foreign exchange. The welfare analysis for the resource-rich countries suggest that both capital flight and FDI reduce economic growth, while for the resource-poor countries neither variable has a significant effect on economic growth. Based on the empirical findings, the dissertation provides brief policy implications regarding capital flight, unrecorded foreign exchange inflows and FDI in the MENA region. ...|$|E

40|$|Despite India’s {{extensive}} development {{achievements in}} the last nearly five decades since independence, {{the fact remains that}} it still remains one of the poorest nations in the world, in terms of per capita income and energy consumption. The per capita energy consumption which indicates the economic status of a nation, is only 0. 25 tons of oil equivalent (TOE) as against nearly 8. 5 TOE of developed nations. If the economic standard of the country is to be raised, an accelerated growth of economy becomes imperative which can greatly be facilitated through increased availability of energy, be it a conventional or non-conventional source of energy. Fortunately, India has vast unexploited hydropower potential estimated at about 84000 MW, the harnessing of which is expected to meet the domestic demand of ever growing population on one hand and relieve the country from heavy burden of <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>outflow</b> and dependence on imported fuel for generating electricity on the another hand.

But these economic benefits to the country are full of miseries to the local residents comprising nearly hundred villages around the Tehri Dam as their only source of livelihood the “irrigation land ” is going to be submerged under its vast water reservoir. On an average, nearly 50000 local village habitants are likely to be rendered homeless.

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} a “modern” {{approach to}} managing risks in cross-border capital movements {{that is consistent}} with an environment of increased and liberalized capital flows. Key elements of this approach include: a consistent monetary and exchange rate policy mix to avoid incentives for volatile capital flows; prudential management of the specific risks in capital flows; supporting financial sector reforms; and appropriate sequencing of liberalization. The approach can reduce the potential size of the shocks associated with capital movements and increase the resilience of the financial system to such shocks when they occur; overtime, it is expected to reduce the need for recourse to capital controls.
