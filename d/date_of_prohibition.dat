5000|$|The {{suppression}} of Isle of Dogs {{has long been}} understood as a significant episode in the complex relations of city, court, and theatre-worlds; its precise significance, however, is difficult to determine. Chambers, while noting Langley's diamond involvement, viewed the play as related to the Privy Council's July 28 order prohibiting acting and ordering that the theaters be [...] "plucked down"; in this view, the leniency shown to the companies {{later in the year}} reflects the transient nature of the offence. Others, among them William Ingram, have questioned this chronology. The July 28 order does not mention the play; it was written in response to one of the city authorities' periodic pleas {{for an end to the}} theatres. The Council issued specific orders against the play in the next month. In this light, Pembroke's men may have made their offence worse by performing the play (wittingly or not) after the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>prohibition.</b> Moreover, Cecil's anger over the stolen diamond may suggest that Langley was the sole target of the July injunction. Andrew Gurr adds to this picture by noting the tendency of the Court to licence two chief companies throughout the later Elizabethan and early Stuart periods.|$|E
40|$|THESIS 7150 This thesis {{was based}} on archival {{research}} in the repositories named in the bibliography. This was supplemented by secondary sources where primary sources were inadequate or unavailable. Archival research has been supplemented by statistical analysis. In the case of film censorship this has been compiled from the Record of films Censored, the Film Censor?s Notebooks and the Reserve Books in the National Archives of Ireland. In the case of book censorship a database was prepared of all the books banned by the Censorship of Publications Board between 1930 and 1939. Taking information from the 1940 Register of Prohibited Publications and Iris Oifigiuil for the period, a Microsoft Works database was created. This listed all the titles, authors, publishers, <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>prohibition,</b> editions prohibited and causes <b>of</b> <b>prohibition.</b> These books were then looked up in the Times Literary Supplement, fhose books that had been reviewed were then given the following additional information: genre, review rating and controversy rating, rhe later figures were numerical assessments of {{the tone of the}} reviews {{and the extent to which}} the reviewers considered the books controversial. This database provides the basis for much of Chapter 7. Principal Findings [...] 1) Extent of censorship in Northern Ireland This thesis shows that censorship in Northern Ireland was most extensive in regard to security matters. Republican, nationalist and socialist newspapers, meetings and displays were frequently suppressed when they were deemed seditious or likely to result in a breach of the peace. There was censorship of films by local authorities and this fitting in with contemporary British practice. There was little or no censorship of publications on moral grounds apart from a few seizures under the Obscene Publications Act, 1857. [...] 2) The role of the Roman Catholic Church. While this thesis does conclude that the Roman Catholic Church was influential in the introduction of the censorship of films and publications in the Irish Free State, it emphasises the importance of intellectuals and lay people rather than the hierarchy...|$|R

The problems of research are {{to find the}} types <b>of</b> <b>prohibition,</b> the pattern <b>of</b> politeness uses in employing prohibition and the implicature <b>of</b> <b>prohibition</b> utterances. So {{the objective of the}} study are to identify the type <b>of</b> <b>prohibition</b> used in movie manuscripts, to identify the pattern of politeness used in movie manuscripts, and to describe the implicature <b>of</b> <b>prohibition</b> utterances. To answer those problems, this research uses document and observation as the method of data collection. The sources of the data are taken from “Ever After” and “Man in the Iron Mask” movie manuscripts. This research employs the sociopragmatic analysis, especially, the types <b>of</b> <b>prohibition</b> utterances by Hornby and Etherton, the politeness strategy by Brown and Levinson, and the implicature by Grice. The result of the study shows that first, there are six types <b>of</b> <b>prohibition.</b> One <b>of</b> them has not yet classified by Hornby and Etherton. That is prohibition that using “can’t + infinitive without “to””. Second, in employing prohibition the speaker uses four pattern of politeness strategy, that is baldly on- record, positive politeness, negative politeness and off-record. Third, the prohibition utterances have implicature as giving suggestion, showing solidarity, showing refusal, showing Allusions, warning, wish, requesting...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} to the understanding <b>of</b> alcohol <b>prohibition</b> by examining the causes and effects <b>of</b> <b>prohibition</b> policy in Indian states over 1957 - 2001. Chapter 2 examines the political economy <b>of</b> <b>prohibition</b> by using a state-level dataset to estimate the determinants <b>of</b> <b>prohibition</b> legislation. The analysis finds prohibition {{to be associated with}} the electoral cycle, legislature identity, lower relative strength of the alcohol industry, and the composition of state finances - in particular the share of central union excise. Chapter 3 focuses on the impact <b>of</b> <b>prohibition</b> on alcohol consumption using a series of cross sections of the National Sample Survey. Unit value analysis is conducted to estimate the impact on prices by alcohol group and uncover the demand and supply dynamics in the market. The relationship between alcohol, tobacco, and pan is examined using prohibition as an exogenous instrument, and the spill-over effects of policy on the demand for these goods are calculated. Prohibition is estimated to decrease alcohol participation by 26 % with the effect varying by alcohol type and extent <b>of</b> <b>prohibition.</b> While both supply and demand shifts drive the decrease in consumption, the evidence suggests the deterrent effect <b>of</b> <b>prohibition</b> is significant. Tobacco and pan are found to be complements to alcohol and prohibition is associated with a fall in their demand. Chapter 4 focuses on the impact <b>of</b> <b>prohibition</b> on intrahousehold resource allocation by estimating Engel curves for broad categories of expenditure. The results indicate prohibition increased outlays for food and fuel with the magnitude of change being consistent with the reduction in alcohol estimated. The negative private and social effects of alcohol use are also examined. Prohibition led to a decrease in spurious liquor consumption and incidence of burglaries. However, it is associated with an increase in liver disease deaths and homicide rates...|$|R
