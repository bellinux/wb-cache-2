5000|$|Bamboo weaving {{is a type}} of bambooworking {{in which}} two {{distinct}} sets of bamboo strips are interlaced at normally right angles to form an object. The longitudinal threads are called the warp and the lateral threads are the weft or <b>filling.</b> (<b>Weft</b> or woof is an old English word meaning [...] "that which is woven".) The method in which these strips are inter-woven affects the characteristics of the fabric.Bamboo is usually woven by hand.|$|E
5000|$|Weaving is {{a method}} of textile {{production}} in which two distinct sets of yarns or threads are interlaced {{at right angles to}} form a fabric or cloth. Other methods are knitting, crocheting, felting, and braiding or plaiting. The longitudinal threads are called the warp and the lateral threads are the weft or <b>filling.</b> (<b>Weft</b> or woof is an old English word meaning [...] "that which is woven".) The method in which these threads are inter-woven affects the characteristics of the cloth.Cloth is usually woven on a loom, a device that holds the warp threads in place while filling threads are woven through them. A fabric band which meets this definition of cloth (warp threads with a weft thread winding between) can also be made using other methods, including tablet weaving, back-strap, or other techniques without looms.|$|E
50|$|Woven materials, like Dacron, may {{specified}} {{as either}} {{high or low}} tenacity, as indicated, in part by their denier count (a unit of measure for the linear mass density of fibers). High-tenacity Dacron comes in multiples of 220, 350 and 570 deniers, whereas low-tenacity Dacron comes in multiples of 150, 250, and 400 deniers. Sailcloth is typically heat-shrunk to tighten the weave and then receives a chemical bonding finish of melamine. Such cloth is typically specified by deniers for warp and <b>fill</b> (<b>weft),</b> e.g. 220/570.|$|R
40|$|A {{proposed}} lightweight {{pressure vessel}} {{would be made}} of a composite of high-tenacity continuous fibers and a flexible matrix material. The flexibility of this pressure vessel would render it (1) compactly stowable for transport and (2) more able to withstand impacts, relative to lightweight pressure vessels made of rigid composite materials. The vessel would be designed as a structural shell wherein the fibers would be predominantly bias-oriented, the orientations being optimized to make the fibers bear the tensile loads in the structure. Such efficient use of tension-bearing fibers would minimize or {{eliminate the need for}} stitching and <b>fill</b> (<b>weft)</b> fibers for strength. The vessel could be fabricated by techniques adapted from filament winding of prior composite-material vessels, perhaps in conjunction with the use of dry film adhesives. In addition to the high-bias main-body substructure described above, the vessel would include a low-bias end substructure to complete coverage and react peak loads. Axial elements would be overlaid to contain damage and to control fiber orientation around side openings. Fiber ring structures would be used as interfaces for connection to ancillary hardware...|$|R
40|$|The through-the-thickness {{properties}} of three-dimensionally (3 D) woven carbon/epoxy composites have been studied. The investigation {{aimed at the}} evaluation and development of test methodologies for the property characterization in the thickness direction, {{and the establishment of}} fiber architectures were studied: layer-to-layer Angle Interlock, through-the-thickness Orthogonal woven preform with surface pile was also designed and manufactured for the fabrication of tensile test coupons with integrated grips. All the preforms were infiltrated by the resin transfer molding technique. The microstructures of the composites were characterized along the warp and <b>fill</b> (<b>weft)</b> directions to determine the degree of yarn undulations, yarn cross-sectional shapes, and microstructural dimensions. These parameters were correlated to the fiber architecture. Specimens were designed and tested for the direct measurement of the through-the-thickness tensile, compressive and shear {{properties of}} the composites. Design optimization was conducted through the analysis of the stress fields within the specimen coupled with experimental verification. The experimentally-derived elastic properties in the thickness direction compared well with analytical predictions obtained from a volume averaging model...|$|R
50|$|Antique satin, {{also called}} satin-back shantung, refers to any five or eight harness (shaft) satin weave that uses slubbed or {{unevenly}} spun yarns in the <b>weft</b> (<b>filling).</b> It is reversible {{in that one}} side is satin and other shantung and is used for simulating 17th and 18th century silks and clothing such as blouses, lingerie and evening wear.|$|R
40|$|Mode I interlaminar {{fracture}} of 3 k 8 -Harness-Satin Carbon cloth, with identical <b>fill</b> and <b>weft</b> yarns, pre-impregnated with Newport 307 resin was investigated through the DCB test (ASTM D 5528). Crack propagations along both the <b>fill</b> and <b>weft</b> yarns were considered for both post-bonded (co-bonded) and co-cured laminates. A patent-pending delamination insertion method {{was compared to}} the standard Teflon film option to assess its applicability to mode I fracture testing. The Modified Beam Theory, Compliance Calibration method, and Modified Compliance Calibration method were used for comparative purposes for these investigations and to evaluate {{the validity of the}} proposed Equivalent Stiffness (EQS) method. Crack propagation, in all specimens, proceeded in a run-arrest manner for both delamination directions. Energy dissipation in the form of transverse yarn debonding, matrix deformation, and out of plane crack growth was witnessed for specimens with delaminations along weft yarns. A complete comparison between post-bonded and co-cured laminates was not achieved. The patent pending delamination insertion method was found to cause fewer instances of non-linear crack initiation behavior than the Teflon insert and, when non-linear behavior did occur, it was less prevalent. The EQS method was found to achieve fracture toughness values within 5 % of the other three data reduction methods for 63 % of the propagation values and achieved conservative values for over 33 % of the propagations. Suggestions for future studies aimed at completing the comparisons above are provided in Chapter 5...|$|R
50|$|The {{amount of}} twist in a yarn helps {{to define the}} style of yarn- a yarn {{with a lot of}} air such as a woollen yarn will have much less twist than a yarn with little air, like a worsted yarn. It also affects the stretchiness of the yarn, {{strength}}, the halo of the yarn, and many other attributes. <b>Filling</b> or <b>weft</b> yarns usually have fewer twists per inch because strength is not as important as with warp yarns, and highly twisted yarns are, in general, stronger. Warp yarns have to be stronger so that they can withstand the tension of the loom. Filament fibers, such as silk, or many synthetics, need only to be twisted slightly to create a yarn.|$|R
50|$|The fabric {{whipcord}} is {{a strong}} worsted or cotton fabric made of hard-twisted yarns with a diagonal cord or rib. The weave used for whipcord is a steep-angled twill, essentially the same weave as a cavalry twill or a steep gabardine. However, the ribs of whipcord are usually more pronounced than in either of those fabrics, and the <b>weft</b> (<b>filling)</b> may be visible between the ribs on the right side, which is usually {{not the case for}} gabardines. In practice, marketing considerations, rather than technical details, determine when the specific term whipcord is used.|$|R
5000|$|Satin is a weave that {{typically}} has a glossy surface and a dull back. The satin weave {{is characterized by}} four or more <b>fill</b> or <b>weft</b> yarns floating over a warp yarn or vice versa, four warp yarns floating over a single weft yarn. Floats are missed interfacings, where the warp yarn lies {{on top of the}} weft in a warp-faced satin and where the weft yarn lies on top of the warp yarns in weft-faced satins. These floats explain the even sheen, as unlike in other weaves, the light reflecting is not scattered as much by the fibres, which have fewer tucks. Satin is usually a warp-faced weaving technique in which warp yarns are [...] "floated" [...] over weft yarns, although there are also weft-faced satins. If a fabric is formed with a satin weave using filament fibres such as silk, nylon, or polyester, the corresponding fabric is termed a satin, although some definitions insist that the fabric be made from silk. If the yarns used are short-staple yarns such as cotton, the fabric formed is considered a sateen.|$|R
50|$|Russell cord is {{a finely}} corded fabric, {{generally}} constructed with a cotton warp and worsted <b>weft</b> (<b>filling).</b> Two or more warp threads are woven {{together to form}} the cord, thus the cord lines run warp-wise. Russell cord is visually similar to a very narrow-waled corduroy called pincord, but it is heavier and more sturdy. It is usually woven using 40% cotton and 60% wool (or similar compositions depending on the weaver). It is mainly used {{in the making of}} quality black academical dress, as well as clerical dress and legal dress in the United Kingdom. It is woven using thicker strands so is heavier than princetta.|$|R
50|$|This {{heavy and}} dull fabric is {{sensitive}} to damage including getting wet which leave white rings and also light which shreds it and changes the fabric color. Therefore, antique satin must not be washed and should be cleaned by a professional fabric expert. The lining is also sewn into the hem so if the lining is altered, the fabric will be damaged. It is usually an upholstery-weight fabric and can be made using silk, rayon or acetate in the warp and coarser cotton or manmade fibers in the <b>weft</b> (<b>filling).</b> It is a satin-faced version of shantung or duppioni. The name refers to the fabric's handspun and hand woven appearance.|$|R
5000|$|Twill fabrics {{technically}} have a {{front and}} a back side, unlike plain weave, whose two sides are the same. The front side of the twill is called the technical face and the back the technical back. The technical face side of a twill weave fabric is the side with the most pronounced wale; it is usually more durable and more attractive, is most often used as the fashion side of the fabric, and is the side visible during weaving. If there are warp floats on the technical face (i.e. if the warp crosses over two or more wefts), there will be <b>filling</b> floats (the <b>weft</b> will cross over two or more warps) on the technical back. If the twill wale goes up to the right on one side, it will {{go up to the}} left on the other side. Twill fabrics have no [...] "up" [...] and [...] "down" [...] as they are woven.|$|R
40|$|Damage {{accumulation}} {{in glass}} fibre woven reinforced epoxy laminates manufactured {{from two different}} fabrics have been investigated under three different loading conditions. One of the woven fabrics was non-hybrid glass using E-glass fibre yams in both warp and <b>weft</b> (<b>fill)</b> directions, the second fabric was a hybrid woven fabric using E-glass fibre yams in the warp direction and R-glass fibre yams in the weft direction. Destructive tests such as interlaminar shear, flexural and uniaxial tension tests were carried out on two different categories. In the first category four different fibre volume fractions of nonhybrid E-glass woven fabric reinforced epoxy resin laminates have been investigated. In the second category hybrid and non-hybrid woven fabric reinforced epoxy resin laminates for similar fibre volume fractions have been investigated. Acoustic Emission (AE) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) were employed as nondestructive tools to predict and characterise the damage events in the composites. All laminates were fabricated using the wet hand lay-up process to laminate the fabric layers prior to curing. Epoxy resin (L 20 -SL set) was the sole matrix used for all composites. Test results showed higher mechanical performance for the hybrid composites and improvements in mechanical properties for higher fibre volume fraction in the non-hybrid composites. DMTA tests were carried out on the laminates of the categories mentioned above, the test results indicated the effect of fibre surface treatment concentration {{on the performance of}} mechanical properties of woven composites. DMTA data has been used to correlate the results of ILSS, flexural and tensile tests. A model was developed in this study based on the damage event sequential process of glass woven fabric reinforced epoxy resin composites. The model is an experimental analysis model, supported by DMTA, AE, SEM and visual examination of specimen fracture surface. ...|$|R
