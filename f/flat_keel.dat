These have {{provided}} us with a general outline of the Athenian trireme. The sheds were ca. 40 m long and just 6 m wide. These dimensions are corroborated by the evidence of Vitruvius, whereby the individual space allotted to each rower was 2 cubits.

The height of the sheds' interior was established as 4.026 metres, leading to estimates that {{the height of the}} hull above the water surface was ca. 2.15metres. Its draught was relatively shallow, about 1metre, which, in addition to the relatively <b>flat</b> <b>keel</b> and low weight, allowed it to be beached easily.|$|E

50|$|In {{line with}} the {{traditional}} structure of Korean ships, the panokseon had a U-shaped hull and a <b>flat</b> <b>keel.</b> This feature {{was due to the}} nature of the Korean coastal waters, which have a large tidal range and flat, expansive tidal plains. A <b>flat</b> <b>keel</b> enables a ship to sit comfortably on the tideland when the tide is out, after coming ashore or inside a wharf at high water. It also ensured greater mobility and a shallow draft and in particular allowed a ship to make sharp changes of direction at short notice.

The fishing operation made use of two posing water flows, one coming from the river and the other from the sea. The filter net locally called "banvar" made of synthetic netting materials of various meshes has a mouth opening of 4 m deep by 10 - 15 m wide which is varied with the length of the fishing boat used. The net with no float and sinker is a long conical shape and during operation it is tied on to two log stretchers after which logs are vertically fixed {{at the side of the}} boat placing the in position underwater. A fishing operation lasts for about one to two hours and this is repeated for five to six times.

The basin of the Mississippi, as has been aptly said, is the 2 ̆ 2 Body of the Nation, 2 ̆ 2 all other parts of the nation being but members, important in themselves, yet more important in their relation to this. (1) In extent it is the second great valley of the world, being exceeded only by that of the Amazon. (2) In a large sense the Mississippi valley includes the whole interior basin, a province which drains into 2, 000 miles of navigable water of the Mississippi itself, 2, 000 miles of the tawny flood of the Missouri, and 1, 000 miles of the Ohio, 5, 000 miles of main water highway, together with fifty-three subordinate rivers, navigable by steamboats, and some hundreds that are navigable by <b>flats</b> and <b>keels.</b> With an area of nearly two and one half million square miles of drainage basin, this drainage basin exceeds in extent the whole of Europe, exclusive of Russia, Norway, and Sweden and is estimated to be able to support a population of two or three hundred million – three times the present population of the whole nation. Conceptions formed from the river basins of Western Europe are rudely shocked when we consider the extent of the valley of the Mississippi; nor are those formed from the sterile basins of the great rivers of Siberia, lofty plateaus of Central Asia, or the mighty sweep of the swampy Amazon more adequate.
