5|$|The German {{evacuation}} {{had been}} carried out <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>orderly</b> fashion. Army Group North's plans had paid off and both the Soviets and the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (German High Command) was surprised and impressed by {{the speed of the}} evacuation. The 8th Army went on to take the remaining West Estonian islands (Moonsund archipelago) in the Moonsund Landing Operation, an amphibious attack. Overall, the Baltic Offensive resulted in the expulsion of German forces from Estonia, Lithuania and a large part of Latvia.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the road}} had been opened between Yudam-ni and Hagaru-ri, the convoy {{still had to}} fight through the {{numerous}} Chinese positions on the hills overlooking the road. On {{the first night of}} the retreat, the Chinese struck the convoy in force and inflicted heavy casualties upon 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines (3/5). Although strong air cover suppressed most of the Chinese forces {{for the rest of the}} march, the cold weather, harassing fire, raiding parties, and road blocks slowed the retreat to a crawl while inflicting numerous casualties. Despite those difficulties, the convoy reached Hagaru-ri <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>orderly</b> fashion on the afternoon of 3 December, with the withdrawal completed on 4 December.|$|E
5|$|Another push against Bosanski Brod was {{launched}} on 27 September. The advance initially had moderate success, until 4 October when the VRS rebalanced its forces, changing the {{sector of the}} bridgehead against which the 1st Krajina Corps was concentrated. The move managed to disrupt the HVO and HV defences and the VRS achieved a breakthrough, capturing Bosanski Brod on 6 October. In response, the HV and the HVO withdrew their troops and equipment <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>orderly</b> fashion, and the bridge spanning the Sava between the town and Slavonski Brod was demolished on 7 October.|$|E

5|$|Grenier {{directed}} his well-managed retreat {{along the road}} toward Haag, with all the units falling back <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>orderly</b> echelon. To save some artillery from capture, the 2nd Dragoons charged their pursuers and captured 100 Austrians. After falling back , the French soldiers reached the open ground around Haag, where they assumed a defensive position. All told, the battle lasted six hours. In addition to the Latour Dragoons, the most heavily engaged Austrian units were the Archduke Charles Infantry Regiment (IR) # 3 and the Waldeck Dragoons # 7 from Riesch's column, plus IR # 60 and the Vecsey Hussars # 4 from Johann Kollowrat's column.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet {{offensive}} commenced {{with the}} Soviet 2nd Shock Army breaching the defence of the II Army Corps along the Emajõgi River {{in the vicinity}} of Tartu. The defenders managed to slow the Soviet advance sufficient for Army Detachment Narwa to be evacuated from mainland Estonia <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>orderly</b> fashion. On 18 September, the constitutional Government of Estonia captured the government buildings in Tallinn from the Germans and the city was abandoned by the German forces by 22 September. The Leningrad Front seized the capital and took the rest of mainland Estonia by 26 September 1944.|$|E
5|$|Although the Germans {{expected}} another Allied {{landing in}} the Mediterranean, the advancing Red Army and the Allied landings in Normandy placed great strains on German resources, so little was done to improve the condition of Army Group G, which was occupying Southern France. Given the advancing Allied forces in northern France, the Germans deemed a realistic defense in the south impossible. Johannes Blaskowitz's Army GroupG headquarters discussed a general withdrawal from southern France in July and August with the German High Command, but the 20 July plot led to an atmosphere in which any withdrawal {{was out of the}} question. Blaskowitz was quite aware that with his scattered forces, any serious Allied landing attempt would be impossible to ward off. He planned a withdrawal in secret, to include demolition of the ports and proceeding <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>orderly</b> manner, covered by the 11th Panzer Division. He intended to establish a new defense line centered on Dijon in central France. German intelligence was aware of the impending Allied landing, and on 13August Blaskowitz ordered the 11th Panzer Division to move east of the Rhône River, where the landing was expected.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} Da Nang fall into North Vietnamese hands, South Vietnamese commanders {{on the ground}} simply lost control of their men as {{military}} discipline collapsed. On March 28, about 6,000 South Vietnamese soldiers of the 2nd Infantry Division deserted, and left the battlefield. And then the soldiers of the ARVN 3rd Infantry Division also retreated, thereby leaving {{the rear of the}} Marine Corps Division exposed to enemy attacks. Since March 25, from the CIA Station in Da Nang, Al Francis and the U.S. Embassy in Saigon began formulating an evacuation plan, in order to evacuate U.S. citizens and South Vietnamese government officials out from Da Nang. As part of the plan, aircraft belonging to civilian airliners were to be used. And in addition to the South Vietnamese navy vessels of I Corps, U.S. General Homer Smith also provided five barges, six passenger liners, and three cargo ships to help with the evacuation process. Even though the evacuation plan was designed to be carried out <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>orderly</b> manner, chaos and confusion quickly descended on the civilian and military population of Da Nang as people fought each other to board the vessels anchored off the coast. On the afternoon of March 29, North Vietnamese soldiers of the 2nd, 304th, 324th and 325th Divisions, as well as the 203rd Armoured Regiment, entered the city of Da Nang.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{withdrawal}} from Hill 504 that evening, 27th Brigade had been reinforced {{on the afternoon}} of 24 April by the arrival of the 5th US Cavalry Regiment. The Americans had been dispatched earlier in the day to ensure that Kapyong remained in UN hands, and one of the battalions was subsequently deployed to the southwest of the D Company, 2 PPCLI on the summit of Hill 677 in order to cover the left flank. A second American battalion occupied a position across the river, southeast of the Middlesex. Likewise, despite heavy casualties in one of the Australian companies and battalion headquarters, 3 RAR had emerged from the intense battle largely intact and had successfully withdrawn <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>orderly</b> fashion. Meanwhile, one of the replacement British battalions, the 1st Battalion, King's Own Scottish Borderers, had also arrived during the 24th and it took up positions with the Australians around Brigade Headquarters. With six UN battalions now holding the valley the Chinese faced a difficult task continuing the advance.|$|E
5|$|With the remanned Maratha {{artillery}} silenced, Wellesley {{turned his}} attention to Pohlmann's reformed infantry. Although Maxwell had suffered heavy losses, he had rallied his cavalry and returned to the field of battle. Wellesley ordered him to charge the Maratha left flank, while the infantry moved forward as a single line to meet the centre and right. The cavalry spurred forward but were met with a volley of canister shot which struck Maxwell, killing him instantly. Their momentum lost, the cavalry did not complete their charge but veered away from the Maratha line at the last moment. The British and Madras infantry marched on against the Maratha position but Pohlmann's men, their morale low, did not wait for the attack and instead retreated northwards across the Juah. Descriptions differ as to the manner of their departure: Maratha sources claim the line marched away from the battlefield <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>orderly</b> manner on Pohlmann's orders but British accounts claim the Maratha infantry fled in an uncontrolled panic. Berar's irregulars inside Assaye, now leaderless and having witnessed the fate of the regular infantry, abandoned the village and marched off northwards at around 18:00, followed shortly afterwards by the Maratha cavalry. Wellesley's troops, however, were exhausted and in no condition to pursue and the native allied cavalry which had remained on the south bank of the Kailna and had not been engaged, refused to pursue without the support of the British and Madras cavalry.|$|E
