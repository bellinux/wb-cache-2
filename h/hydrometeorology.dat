25|$|Meteorology, climatology, {{atmospheric}} physics, {{and atmospheric}} chemistry are sub-disciplines of the atmospheric sciences. Meteorology and hydrology compose the interdisciplinary field of <b>hydrometeorology.</b> The interactions between Earth's atmosphere and its oceans {{are part of}} a coupled ocean-atmosphere system. Meteorology has application in many diverse fields such as the military, energy production, transport, agriculture, and construction.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hydro{{meteorology}}</b> is {{the branch}} of meteorology that deals with the hydrologic cycle, the water budget, and the rainfall statistics of storms. A hydrometeorologist prepares and issues forecasts of accumulating (quantitative) precipitation, heavy rain, heavy snow, and highlights areas {{with the potential for}} flash flooding. Typically the range of knowledge that is required overlaps with climatology, mesoscale and synoptic meteorology, and other geosciences.|$|E
25|$|Between 1983 and 1986, Kabishev was a {{department}} {{head in the}} Proletarsky Raion Executive Committee of Moscow. On 11 March 1985 he was awarded a second Order of the Patriotic War 1st class on the 40th anniversary {{of the end of}} World War II. He then was {{a department}} head and deputy head of the USSR State Committee for <b>Hydrometeorology</b> between 1986 and 1991. He lived in Moscow and died on 5 December 1998. Kabishev was buried in the Troyekurovskoye Cemetery.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Rafael L. Bras is an {{engineer}} and expert in <b>hydrometeorology</b> and global warming. As {{an engineer}}ing hydrologist, his major areas of interest include land-atmosphere interactions and geomorphology. He {{is considered one of}} the world's leading experts in global warming, and has also served as a professional consultant in multiple projects around the world. As a hydrologist, Dr. Bras has specialized in the interpretation of natural phenomena as random functions. He has been recognized for his use of modern probabilistic methods in the design of networks to monitor rainfall and river flow, and in rainfall and river discharge forecasting. Presently his interests span the areas of fluvial geomorphology and hydroclimatology.|$|E
25|$|The Outdoor Gallery {{comprises}} the north, south, and east aprons of Pier 15, and extends through both ticketed and unticketed space. Focus is on direct {{interaction with the}} Bay environment, which {{can be seen in}} exhibits such as Color of Water (an installation of 32 distinct color swatches suspended below the rail surrounding the pier so that visitors can investigate the changing colors of the Bay’s water). Another notable exhibit is Remote Rains, which allows visitors to choose a past rainstorm as profiled by the <b>Hydrometeorology</b> Testbed, which is then recreated by a rain machine that duplicates the frequency, size, and velocity of the raindrops, giving a tangible experience of NOAA research data on storms.|$|E

2500|$|Since the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union, environmental regulation is largely unchanged in Turkmenistan. The new government created the Ministry of Natural Resources Use and Environmental Protection in July 1992, with departments responsible for environmental protection, protection of flora and fauna, forestry, <b>hydrometeorology,</b> and administrative planning. Like other CIS republics, Turkmenistan has established an Environmental Fund based on revenues collected from environmental fines, but the fines generally are too low to accumulate significant revenue. Thanks to the former Soviet system of game preserves and the efforts of the Society for Nature Conservation and the Academy of Sciences, flora and fauna receive some protection in the republic; however, [...] "hard-currency hunts" [...] by wealthy Western and Arab businesspeople already are depleting animals on preserves.|$|E
2500|$|Boris Dmitrievich Kabishev (Russian: Борис Дмитриевич Кабишев; 17 October 1922-5 December 1998) was a Soviet Air Defence Forces (PVO) Lieutenant {{general and}} Hero of the Soviet Union.
