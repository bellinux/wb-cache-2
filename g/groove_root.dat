This new SNCF has been defined under triaxial stress state. The employed specimens have constant groove depth with net section and gross diameters of 10. 0 and 16. 7 mm, respectively. The length of flatness ao has been varied form 0. 0 ~ 12. 5 mm to study the elastic SNCF {{of this type of}} geometrical irregularities. The results that the elastic new SNCF rapidly drops from its elastic value of the groove with ao = 0. 0, i. e. circumferential U-notch, and reaches minimum value at ao = 2 mm. After that the elastic new SNCF becomes nearly constant with increasing flatness length (ao). The value of tensile load at yielding at the <b>groove</b> <b>root</b> increases with increasing ao.

40|$|Weld {{imperfections}} are tolerable defects {{as stated}} {{from the international}} standard. Nevertheless they can produce a set of drawbacks like difficulty to assembly, reworking, limited fatigue life, and surface imperfections. In this paper Ti 6 Al 4 V titanium butt welds were produced by CO 2 laser welding. The following tolerable defects were analysed: weld undercut, excess weld metal, excessive penetration, incomplete filled <b>groove,</b> <b>root</b> concavity, and lack of penetration. A neuro-fuzzy model for the prediction and classification of the defects in the fused zone was built up using the experimental data. Weld imperfections were connected to the welding parameters by feed forward neural networks. Then the imperfections were clustered using the C-means fuzzy clustering algorithm. The clusters were named after the ISO standard classification of the levels of imperfection for electron and laser beam welding of aluminium alloys and steels.

40|$|Background: The {{etiology}} of periodontal diseases is multifactorial including both systemic and local causes. Local {{factors such as}} <b>grooves</b> on <b>root</b> surfaces contribute {{a great deal to}} the causation of periodontal diseases. Materials and Methods: Proximal radicular grooves were studied in 150 extracted maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth.

The relationship of the presence and absence of grooves with periodontal attachment loss was also studied. Results: The prevalence of proximal <b>root</b> <b>grooves</b> was found to be 86. 67 %. The prevalence of grooves on maxillary teeth was 43. 42 % and on mandibular teeth was 56. 67 %. A greater loss of attachment was present on grooved surfaces than on nongrooved surfaces.

The total plaque mass, specific periodontopathogens, the tooth morphology, and local environmental factors may challenge this balance.

ObjectivesThe aim of this retrospective {{study was to determine}} the significance of proximal <b>root</b> <b>grooves</b> as a risk factor in the periodontal attachment loss; the effect of their dimensions and locations has been evaluated. Materials and methodsOne hundred (100) extracted formalin stored single rooted permanent anterior teeth were studied by staining with 0. 1 % toludine blue to visualize attached periodontal ligament remnants. On each tooth, the loss of attachment was measured from the cemento–enamel junction to the most coronal level of the stained periodontal ligament remnants. ResultsThe prevalence of proximal <b>root</b> <b>grooves</b> was found to be 81 % and a statistically significant greater loss of attachment was present on grooved than on non-grooved surfaces (p< 0. 01).

40|$|Geometric and crystallographic {{measurements}} of grainboundary thermal grooves and surface faceting {{behavior as a}} function of orientation have been used to determine the surface energy anisotropy of SrTiO 3 at 1400 °C in air. Under these conditions, thermal grooves are formed by surface diffusion. The surface energy anisotropy was determined using the capillarity vector reconstruction method under the assumption that Herring’s local equilibrium condition holds at the <b>groove</b> <b>root.</b> The results indicate that the (100) surface has the minimum energy. For surfaces inclined between 0 ° and 30 ° from (100), the energy increases with the inclination angle. Orientations inclined by more than 30 ° from (100) are all about 10 % higher in energy and, within experimental uncertainty, energetically equivalent. A procedure for estimating the uncertainties in the reconstructed energies is also introduced. Taken together, the orientation dependence of the surfacefacet formation and the measured energy anisotropy lead {{to the conclusion that the}} equilibrium crystal shape is dominated by { 100 }, but also includes { 110 } and { 111 } facets.

40|$|Abstract. Existence and {{uniqueness}} {{are proven}} for a travelling wave solution for {{a problem in}} which motion by mean curvature is coupled with surface diffusion. This problem pertains to a bicrystal in a ”quarter-loop ” geometry in which one grain grows {{at the expense of}} the other, and the internal grain boundary between the two crystals contacts the exterior surface at a ”groove root ” or ”tri-junction ” where various balance laws hold. Far in front and behind the <b>groove</b> <b>root</b> the overall height of the bicrystal is assumed to be unperturbed. Whereas in a previous paper [15] a partially linearized formulation was considered for which explicit solutions could be found, here we treat the fully nonlinear problem. Employing an angle formulation and a scaled arc-length parameterization, we reduce the problem to the solution of a third order ODE with a jump condition at the origin. Existence is proven if m, the ratio of the exterior surface energy to the surface energy of the grain boundary, is less than about ≈. 92. Uniqueness of these solutions is demonstrated within the class of single-valued solutions. A numerical comparison is made with the solution of the partially linearized formulation found earlier for the sake of illustration...|$|E
40|$|We derive the {{modified}} Young's equation for the equilibrium dihedral angle at the triple junction of the grain boundary groove by {{taking into account}} the discrete structure of the low angle grain boundary. For low angle grain boundaries, the geometric relation that the misorientation of the bicrystal is inversely proportional to the dislocation spacing naturally gives rise to the variation in the misorientation when the grain boundary length changes (holding the number of dislocations constant). The fact that the grain boundary energy increases as the grain boundary length decreases due to a smaller dislocation spacing leads to a larger dihedral angle compared to that of the classical theory. Two atomistic continuum modelling tools, namely the phase field crystal model and the amplitude equations, are used to simulate the equilibrium dihedral angle. The numerical results are in quantitatively good agreement with the derived modified Young's equation. Furthermore, the amplitude equations are employed to investigate the kinetics of the grain boundary grooving. The time-independent groove shape as predicted by Mullins is observed for bicrystal with high misorientation, and the groove width scales with time approximately as a power law t(1 / 4). For bicrystals with small misorientations, the <b>groove</b> <b>root</b> exhibits a stick-slip motion due to volatile dislocation motion toward the liquid phase as it is close to the triple junction.

40|$|Liquid metal {{embrittlement}} (LME) {{is a common}} feature of systems in which a low melting point liquid metal is in contact with another, higher melting point, polycrystalline metal. While different systems exhibit different LME fracture characteristics, the penetration of nanometer-thick liquid metal films along the grain boundary {{is one of the}} hallmarks of the process. We employ EAM potentials optimized for Al-Ga binary alloys in a series of MD simulations of an Al bicrystal (with a Σ 5 36. 9 ^∘ /[010] symmetric tilt boundary) in contact with liquid Ga with and without an applied stress. Our simulations clarify the mechanism of LME and how it is affected by applied stresses. The interplay of stress and penetrating Ga atoms leads to the nucleation of a train of dislocations on the grain boundary below the liquid <b>groove</b> <b>root</b> which climbs down the grain boundary at a nearly constant rate. The dislocation climb mechanism and the Ga penetration are coupled. While the dislocations do relax part of the applied stress, the residual stresses keep the grain boundary open, thereby allowing more, fast Ga transport to the penetration front (i. e., Ga layer thickening process). The coupled Ga transport and "dislocation climb" {{is the key to the}} anomalously fast, time-independent penetration of Ga along grain boundaries in Al.

METHODS: CT images of 90 lower third molars (64 patients, mean age 34. 6 years) in which plain radiography was insufficient to allow determination of the precise anatomical relations were reviewed retrospectively. Panoramic views of 88 teeth existed; these images were interpreted independent of the CT examinations with respect to presence of a dark band across the roots. RESULTS: In 31 % of the CT images, the course of the mandibular canal was buccal, in 33 % lingual, in 26 % inferior, and in 10 % inter-radicular. The tooth was in contact with the mandibular canal in 94 % and with the lingual cortex in 86 %. In 23 %, <b>grooving</b> of the <b>root</b> by the canal was judged to be present. In 63 % of the cases where a dark band across the roots was observed on panoramic radiographs, CT revealed <b>grooving</b> of the <b>root.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Pre-operative CT of lower third molars is motivated in selected cases when plain radiography is inconclusive. The finding of a dark band across the roots on panoramic radiographs is an indicator of grooving of the tooth by the canal and justifies a pre-operative CT examination. The absence of dark bands on panoramic views does not exclude <b>grooving</b> of the <b>roots...</b>|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to measure the length of the root of lower central incisors (LCI), as well as the width and depth of the concavities of their proximal surfaces. Material and methods: The width and depth of root concavities, as well as root length, were evaluated in 90 LCI. All teeth were measured using a digital contour measuring instrument (Contracer®) for the <b>root</b> <b>grooves</b> and a digital calliper for evaluating root length. Results:After statistical analysis (t- Student and Kruskal-Wallis Anova tests, p< 0. 05) it was possible to confirm: the mean root length on its distal surface (13. 88 ± 1. 47 mm) and on its mesial surface (13. 88 ± 1. 47 mm) and on its mesial surface (13. 76 ± 1. 50 mm). Concavities were present in 100 % of the samples; concavities were found 2 mm, coronally from the CEJ, at the CEJ, and at all root surface. The concavities were wider than deeper; on the mesial surface, the greatest width was 1. 717 mm and the greatest depth was 0. 118 mm. Conclusion: The distal surface of the lower central incisor is the longest. The root concavities on the proximal surfaces are present in 100 %; the greatest width and depth was at 6 mm apically from the CEJ at both sides, which corresponds to the root middle third.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{introduces}} {{an experimental}} work {{carried out in}} multi-pass laser welding with cold filler wire and laser-arc hybrid welding of thick section austenitic stainless steel. As it has been demonstrated earlier, hybrid and cold wire welding with a keyhole-mode can offer very efficient way to produce multi-pass welds in narrow gap thick section joints. However, when multi-pass welding is applied to one pass per layer method without e. g. scanning or defocusing, the used groove width needs to be very narrow {{in order to ensure}} the proper melting of groove side walls and thus to avoid lack of fusion/cold-run defects. As a consequence of the narrow groove, particularly in thick section joints, the accessibility of an arc torch or a wire nozzle into the very bottom of a <b>groove</b> in <b>root</b> pass welding can be considerably restricted. In an alternative approach described in this paper, a power density of a laser beam spot was purposely dispersed by using a defocusing technique. In groove filling experiments, a power density of defocused laser beam was kept in the range, which led the welding process towards to conduction limited regime and thus enabled to achieve broader weld cross-sections. The object was to study the feasibility of defocusing as a way to fill and bridge wider groove geometries than what can be welded with focused keyhole-mode welding with filler addition.

Previously reported two-dimensional (2 D) computational models, account for the large deformation of the porous material by solving the fully coupled governing fibre stress and fluid-flow equations using finite element techniques. While the 2 D simulations provide much insight into the overarching cause-effect relationships, predictions of mechanical quantities such as roll separating force and particularly torque {{as a function of}} roll speed and degree of compression are not satisfactory for industrial use. It is considered that the unsatisfactory response in roll torque prediction {{may be due to the}} stress levels that exist between the <b>groove</b> tips and <b>roots</b> which have been largely neglected in the geometrically simplified 2 D model. This paper gives results for both two- and three-dimensional finite element models and highlights their strengths and weaknesses in predicting key milling parameters. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to compare soft-tissue {{dissolution}} by sodium hypochlorite, with an EDTA intermediate rinse, with or without activation with passive ultrasonic activation (PUI) or sonic activation using the Endoactivator (EA) or Eddy tips (ED). The root canals of eighty-three human maxillary central incisors were chemo-mechanically prepared and the teeth split. A standardized longitudinal intracanal groove was created in one of the root halves. Eighty-three porcine palatal mucosa samples were collected, adapted to fit into the grooves and weighed. The re-assembled specimens were randomly divided into four experimental groups (n = 20), based on the final rinse: no activation; EA; PUI; ED, using 2. 5 % sodium hypochlorite, with an EDTA intermediate rinse. A control group (n = 3) was irrigated with distilled water without activation. The solutions were delivered using a syringe and needle 2 mm from working length. Total irrigation time was 150 s, including 60 s of activation in the specific groups. The study was carried out at 36 ± 2 °C. The porcine palatal mucosa samples were weighed after completion of the assays. Student paired t-test and anova were used to assess the intra- and intergroup weight changes. The multiple comparisons were evaluated using Bonferroni correction (α = 0. 05). Weight loss occurred in all experimental groups. Irrigant activation resulted in greater weight loss when compared to the nonactivated group [vs. EA (P = 0. 001); vs. PUI (P < 0. 001); vs. ED (P < 0. 001) ]. No significant differences were found amongst the different activation systems. Activation increased the tissue-dissolving activity of irrigants from artificial <b>grooves</b> in <b>root</b> canals of maxillary central incisors.

40|$|Introduction The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the removal of dentin debris from artificially made <b>grooves</b> in standardized <b>root</b> canals by 6 different final irrigation techniques. Methods Conventional syringe irrigation, manual dynamic activation (MDA) with tapered or nontapered gutta-percha (GP) cones, the Safety Irrigator system, continuous ultrasonic irrigation (CUI), and apical negative pressure (ANP) irrigation were tested ex vivo in 20 root canals with a standardized, debris-filled groove in the apical portion of one canal wall. After each irrigation procedure, the groove was photographed, and the residual amount of dentin debris was scored. Results There was no significant difference between the MDA with a nontapered GP cone, the Safety Irrigator, and the ANP irrigation. These techniques produced better cleaning efficacy than syringe irrigation (P <. 005) but significantly worse than the MDA with a tapered cone (P <. 05). CUI was significantly better than all the other techniques tested in this study (P <. 001). Conclusions CUI was the most effective technique in dentin debris removal from the apical irregularities, and syringe irrigation alone was the least effective. MDA technique was more effective with a tapered GP cone than with a nontapered one...|$|R
