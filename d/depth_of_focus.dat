25|$|The focus spread {{is related}} to the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>focus.</b> Ray (2000, 56) gives two {{definitions}} of the latter.

With the first definition, focus spread and <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>focus</b> are usually close in value though conceptually different.

40|$|Upper mantle {{velocity}} {{structure in}} the Kurile Islands, Kamchatka, and the Sea of Okhotsk regions of the northwest Pacific has been studied in detail by analysis of P- and S-wave travel-time data of 137 mantle earthquakes. Wave velocities were obtained at the <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>foci</b> <b>of</b> earthquakes, in the inclined seismic zones in these regions, by using Kaila's (1969) analytical method. The P- and S-wave velocity functions obtained for the inclined seismic zones beneath the southern Kuriles, northern Kuriles, and the Kamchatka regions each show a linear increase of velocity to a <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> about 180 km. However, there are significant lateral variations of the velocity {{structure in the}} inclined seismic zones beneath these regions. The velocities determined for the southern Kuriles seismic zone increase from 8. 15 km/sec at 40 km depth to 8. 63 km/sec at 185 km depth for P waves, and from 4. 59 km/sec at 40 km depth to 4. 80 km/sec at 170 km depth for S waves.

The visual bridge between these two different looks was how he photographed the night scenes. Instead of adopting the usual blue moonlight or blue street lamp look, he used an orange sodium-light effect.

The generalized nonlinear chirp scaling (GNLCS) algorithm that is proposed in this paper uses the method of series reverse (MSR) to improve the ADOF and focusing precision.

40|$|Propagating {{light beams}} with widths down to {{and below the}} optical {{wavelength}} require bulky large-aperture lenses and remain focused only for micrometric distances. Here, we report the observation of light beams that violate this localization/depth- of-focus law by shrinking as they propagate, allowing resolution to be maintained and increased over macroscopic propagation lengths. In nanodisordered ferroelectrics we observe a non-paraxial propagation of a sub-micrometre-sized beam for over 1, 000 diffraction lengths, the narrowest visible beam reported to date. This unprecedented effect {{is caused by the}} nonlinear response of a dipolar glass, which transforms the leading opticalwave equation into a Klein-Gordon-type equation that describes a massive particle field.

2500|$|Assist {{features}} {{are often used}} to help balance asymmetry from non-telecentricity at different slit positions, due to different illumination angles, starting at the 7nm node. However, the asymmetry is reduced but not completely eliminated, since the assist features mainly enhance the highest spatial frequencies, whereas intermediate spatial frequencies, which also affect feature focus and position, are not much affected. The coupling between the primary image and the self images is too strong for the asymmetry to be completely eliminated by assist features; only asymmetric illumination can achieve this. Assist features may also {{get in the way}} of access to power/ground rails. Power rails are expected to be wider, which also limits the effectiveness of using assist features, by constraining the local pitch. Local pitches between 1x and 2x the minimum pitch forbid assist feature placement, as there is simply no room to preserve the local pitch symmetry. In fact, for the application to the two-bar asymmetry case, the optimum assist feature placement may be less than or exceed the two-bar pitch. Depending on the parameter to be optimized (process window area, <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>focus,</b> exposure latitude), the optimum assist feature configuration can be very different, e.g., pitch between assist feature and bar being different from two-bar pitch, symmetric or asymmetric, etc..|$|E
50|$|The same {{factors that}} {{determine}} {{depth of field}} also determine <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>focus,</b> but these factors can have different effects {{than they have in}} depth of field.
