5|$|Approximately 270petajoules(PJ) of {{geothermal}} heating {{was used in}} 2004. More than half went for space heating, and another third for heated pools. The remainder supported industrial and agricultural applications. Global installed capacity was 28GW, but capacity factors tend to be low (30% on average) since <b>heat</b> <b>is</b> mostly needed in winter. Some 88PJ for space heating was extracted by an estimated 1.3million geothermal heat pumps with a total capacity of 15 GW.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{internal}} <b>heat</b> <b>is</b> {{thermal energy}} generated from radioactive decay and continual heat loss from Earth's formation. Temperatures at the core–mantle boundary may reach over 4000°C (7,200°F). The high temperature and pressure in Earth's interior cause some rock to melt and solid mantle to behave plastically, resulting in {{portions of the}} mantle convecting upward since it is lighter than the surrounding rock. Rock and water is heated in the crust, sometimes up to 370°C (700°F).|$|E

5|$|Experiments and ice {{modeling}} {{published in}} 2016, indicate that tidal flexing dissipation can generate one {{order of magnitude}} more heat in Europa's ice than scientists had previously assumed. Their results indicates {{that most of the}} heat generated by the ice actually comes from the ice's crystalline structure (lattice) as a result of deformation, and not friction between the ice grains. The greater the deformation of the ice sheet, the more <b>heat</b> <b>is</b> generated.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, {{as part of}} Sheffield City Council's {{drive to}} become {{self-sufficient}} for energy, construction of a biomass power station began. It is operated by E.ON UK, and was completed in 2014. It generates 30megawatts by burning waste wood, sourced from the United Kingdom, and waste <b>heat</b> <b>is</b> captured to provide a district heating scheme.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium {{isotopes}} undergo radioactive decay, {{which produces}} decay heat. Different isotopes produce different amounts of heat per mass. The decay <b>heat</b> <b>is</b> usually listed as watt/kilogram, or milliwatt/gram. In larger pieces of plutonium (e.g. a weapon pit) and inadequate heat removal the resulting self-heating may be significant. All isotopes produce weak gamma radiation on decay.|$|E
25|$|Space <b>heating</b> <b>is</b> used to {{warm the}} {{interiors}} of buildings. Space heaters are useful in places where air-handling is difficult, such as in laboratories. Several methods of electric space <b>heating</b> <b>are</b> used.|$|R

50|$|Hot {{water used}} for space <b>heating</b> may <b>be</b> <b>heated</b> by fossil fuels in a boiler, while potable water may <b>be</b> <b>heated</b> in a {{separate}} appliance. This is common practice in the US, especially when warm-air space <b>heating</b> <b>is</b> usually employed.|$|R
5|$|The corona is {{the next}} layer of the Sun. The low corona, near {{the surface of the}} Sun, has a {{particle}} density around 1015m−3 to 1016m−3. The average temperature of the corona and solar wind is about 1,000,000–2,000,000 K; however, in the hottest regions it is 8,000,000–20,000,000 K. Although no complete theory yet exists to account for the temperature of the corona, at least some of its <b>heat</b> <b>is</b> known to be from magnetic reconnection.|$|E
5|$|The {{observed}} {{power output}} of 4.7 gigawatts is challenging to explain from tidal heating alone, so {{the main source}} of heat remains a mystery. Most scientists think the observed heat flux of Enceladus is not enough to maintain the subsurface ocean, and therefore any subsurface ocean must be a remnant of a period of higher eccentricity and tidal heating, or the <b>heat</b> <b>is</b> produced through another mechanism.|$|E
5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. <b>Heat</b> <b>is</b> {{constantly}} lost from the body. Food products reach {{the heart and}} are processed into new blood, releasing fire during metabolism, which raises the blood temperature too high. That raises the heart temperature, causing lung volume to increase, in turn raising the airflow at the mouth. The cool air brought in through the mouth reduces the heart temperature, so the lung volume accordingly decreases, restoring the temperature to normal.|$|E
50|$|Rav Wilding was due {{to compete}} in the series but had to pull out before the series began due to injury, and was {{replaced}} by Martin Offiah.

40|$|The {{studies of}} Lindzen and Hou (1988) of Hadley {{circulation}} forced by global <b>heating</b> distributions <b>are</b> extended to situations where <b>heating</b> <b>is</b> latitudinally concentrated. The qualitative effect of narrow <b>heating</b> <b>is</b> examined {{by means of}} simple 'equal area' arguments of the type developed by Held and Hou (1980). Numerical calculations for a continuous fluid are carried out, showing that {{the intensity of the}} resulting Hadley circulation depends on how the <b>heating</b> <b>is</b> concentrated. It is shown that only a mild concentration is needed to achieve agreement with observations...|$|R

5|$|The thermal {{conductivity}} of heliumII {{is greater than}} that of any other known substance, a million times that of heliumI and several hundred times that of copper. This is because heat conduction occurs by an exceptional quantum mechanism. Most materials that conduct heat well have a valence band of free electrons which serve to transfer the heat. HeliumII has no such valence band but nevertheless conducts heat well. The flow of <b>heat</b> <b>is</b> governed by equations that are similar to the wave equation used to characterize sound propagation in air. When <b>heat</b> <b>is</b> introduced, it moves at 20 meters per second at 1.8K through heliumII as waves in a phenomenon known as second sound.|$|E
5|$|Today, {{nuclear fusion}} in the Sun's core has {{modified}} the composition by converting hydrogen into helium, so the innermost {{portion of the}} Sun is now roughly 60% helium, with the abundance of heavier elements unchanged. Because <b>heat</b> <b>is</b> transferred from the Sun's core by radiation rather than by convection (see Radiative zone below), none of the fusion products from the core have risen to the photosphere.|$|E
5|$|A planet or moon's {{interior}} <b>heat</b> <b>is</b> {{produced from}} the collisions {{that created the}} body, by the decay of radioactive materials (e.g. uranium, thorium, and 26Al), or tidal heating caused by interactions with other bodies. Some planets and moons accumulate enough heat to drive geologic processes such as volcanism and tectonics. Those that accumulate or retain an atmosphere can also undergo surface erosion from wind or water. Smaller bodies, without tidal heating, cool more quickly; and their geological activity ceases {{with the exception of}} impact cratering.|$|E

5|$|Although Jupiter {{would need}} to be about 75 times as massive to fuse {{hydrogen}} and become a star, the smallest red dwarf is only about 30 percent larger in radius than Jupiter. Despite this, Jupiter still radiates more heat than it receives from the Sun; the amount of heat produced inside it is similar to the total solar radiation it receives. This additional <b>heat</b> <b>is</b> generated by the Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism through contraction. This process causes Jupiter to shrink by about 2cm each year. When it was first formed, Jupiter was much hotter and was about twice its current diameter.|$|E
5|$|Although {{white dwarf}} {{material}} is initially plasma—a fluid composed of nuclei and electrons—it was theoretically predicted in the 1960s {{that at a}} late stage of cooling, it should crystallize, starting at its center. The crystal structure {{is thought to be}} a body-centered cubic lattice. In 1995 it was suggested that asteroseismological observations of pulsating white dwarfs yielded a potential test of the crystallization theory, and in 2004, observations were made that suggested approximately 90% of the mass of BPM 37093 had crystallized. Other work gives a crystallized mass fraction of between 32% and 82%. As a white dwarf core undergoes crystallization into a solid phase, latent <b>heat</b> <b>is</b> released which provides a source of thermal energy that delays its cooling.|$|E
5|$|Another common process, {{explosion}} welding, {{involves the}} joining of materials by pushing them together under extremely high pressure. The {{energy from the}} impact plasticizes the materials, forming a weld, even though only {{a limited amount of}} <b>heat</b> <b>is</b> generated. The process is commonly used for welding dissimilar materials, such as the welding of aluminum with steel in ship hulls or compound plates. Other solid-state welding processes include friction welding (including friction stir welding), magnetic pulse welding, co-extrusion welding, cold welding, diffusion bonding, exothermic welding, high frequency welding, hot pressure welding, induction welding, and roll welding.|$|E

5|$|Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) systems use lenses or {{mirrors and}} {{tracking}} systems to focus {{a large area}} of sunlight into a small beam. The concentrated <b>heat</b> <b>is</b> then used as a heat source for a conventional power plant. A wide range of concentrating technologies exists; the most developed are the parabolic trough, the concentrating linear fresnel reflector, the Stirling dish and the solar power tower. Various techniques are used to track the Sun and focus light. In all of these systems a working fluid is heated by the concentrated sunlight, and is then used for power generation or energy storage.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{internal}} heat {{comes from}} a combination of residual heat from planetary accretion (about 20%) and heat produced through radioactive decay (80%). The major heat-producing isotopes within Earth are potassium-40, uranium-238, and thorium-232. At the center, the temperature may be up to , and the pressure could reach 360GPa. Because much of the <b>heat</b> <b>is</b> provided by radioactive decay, scientists postulate that early in Earth's history, before isotopes with short half-lives were depleted, Earth's heat production was much higher. At approximately , twice the present-day heat would have been produced, increasing the rates of mantle convection and plate tectonics, and allowing the production of uncommon igneous rocks such as komatiites that are rarely formed today.|$|E
5|$|From the hoppers, {{the waste}} falls onto the furnace-charging chute {{and from there}} onto the incinerating grate. Here it is burned at a {{temperature}} in excess of 1,200°C. This <b>heat</b> <b>is</b> then converted into super heated steam through the plant's boilers. This in turn powers steam turbines, much {{in the same way}} as a conventional thermal power station. Electricity is generated at 11 kilovolts. After exiting the turbines, the steam is condensed back to water. For the original two incinerating lines use river water from the Tees as a cooling medium, whereas in the third line, water is condensed through air cooled condenser. The cooled water is treated and reused in the boilers.|$|E

5|$|Hypothermia {{is reduced}} body {{temperature}} {{that happens when}} a body loses more heat than it generates. Hypothermia is a major limitation to swimming or diving in cold water. The reduction in finger dexterity due to pain or numbness decreases general safety and work capacity, which in turn {{increases the risk of}} other injuries. Body <b>heat</b> <b>is</b> lost much more quickly in water than in air, so water temperatures that would be tolerable as outdoor air temperatures can lead to hypothermia, which may lead to death from other causes in inadequately protected divers.|$|E
