5|$|The {{stained glass}} in the west window dates from 1875; it was made by Clayton and Bell and depicts the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple. Also by Clayton and Bell <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>window</b> at {{the west end of}} the north wall of the nave {{depicting}} Enoch, Noah, Job and Abel. To the east of this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>window</b> designed by Michael Farrar-Bell dated 1985, to the memory of a local farmer, depicting the Creation. Beyond this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>window</b> from 1901 made by Reuben Bennett which depicts the Good Shepherd with David and Miriam. On the south wall of the nave <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>window</b> from 1919 by Harry Clarke depicting Richard Coeur-de-Lion, saints and military emblems. In other windows on the south wall there are fragments of old glass. The north wall of the north transept contains a window with stained glass by Kempe which incorporates some pieces of medieval glass and depicts the Tree of Jesse. On the east wall of the transept are two windows by John Hardman which date from 1862 and 1864. The south transept contains a window dating from 1855 with stained glass by William Wailes. The east window was reglazed in 1876 by Clayton and Bell; it shows episodes from the life of Christ with figures of apostles and prophets. In the porch is more stained glass by Kempe, dating from 1878.|$|E
5|$|Above {{the statue}} and framed by marble pilasters <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>window</b> that depicts scenes from Philadelphia history. In the window's {{tympanum}} is a depiction of Independence Hall. Below that are pictures showing William Penn's {{treaty with the}} Indians, George Washington's Farewell Address to Congress, the proclamation of the Declaration of Independence, the Philadelphia Convention, the drafting of the Declaration of Independence, Benjamin Franklin's printing office, Betsy Ross exhibiting the United States flag, and Caesar Rodney's ride from Delaware. The border of the window contains portrait busts of notable American Revolution-era Philadelphians: John Bartram, George Clymer, Robert Morris, David Rittenhouse, Benjamin Rush, and James Wilson.|$|E
5|$|Before the Reformation in the mid-sixteenth {{century the}} {{interiors}} of Scottish churches were often elaborate and colourful. Particularly in the north-east {{of the country}} there were highly decorated sacrament houses, like the ones surviving at Kinkell from 1524 and Deskford from 1541. Monumental effigies in churches were usually fully coloured and gilded and dedicated {{to members of the}} clergy, knights and their wives. In contrast to England, where the fashion for stone-carved monuments gave way to monumental brasses, in Scotland they continued to be produced {{until the end of the}} Medieval period. These include the very elaborate Douglas tombs in the town of Douglas and the tomb built for Alexander McLeod (d. 1528) at Rodel in Harris. Scotland's ecclesiastical art paid a heavy toll as a result of Reformation iconoclasm, with the almost total loss of medieval stained glass, religious sculpture and paintings. The only significant surviving pre-Reformation stained glass in Scotland <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>window</b> of four roundels in the St. Magdalen Chapel of Cowgate, Edinburgh, completed in 1544. Wood carving can be seen at King's College, Aberdeen and Dunblane Cathedral. In the West Highlands, where there had been a hereditary caste of monumental sculptors, the uncertainty and loss of patronage caused by the rejection of monuments in the Reformation meant that they moved into another branches of the Gaelic learned orders or took up other occupations. The lack of transfer of carving skills is noticeable in the decline in quality when gravestones were next commissioned from the start of the seventeenth century. According to N. Prior, the nature of the Scottish Reformation may have had wider effects, limiting the creation of a culture of public display and meaning that art was channelled into more austere forms of expression with an emphasis on private and domestic restraint.|$|E

5|$|There {{are small}} {{enclosed}} chambers {{to either side}} of the centre chapel. The chapel of St Padarn is on the left, with an imitation pointed vault and slate slab floor. In the entrance to the chapel there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>window</b> on the left side depicting scenes from the manuscript Life of Padarn. The single-light window with various figures, scenes and motifs is by Elizabeth Edmundson, and dates from 1988. It includes Teilo, Padarn and Dewi (David) at the top, a healing by St Samson, Maelgwn, Arthur and Caradog, two kings of Ireland on horseback and a figure with the Virgin and Child. The figures are mostly modelled on figures from the Book of St Chad. In the chapel itself, which has a low slate altar stone and seat, is a porcelain relief sculpture by Gillian Still showing a story from the Life, the ordeal by boiling water. The chapel is lit only by two small windows (one with red glass, the other green) into the central chapel. Neither the altar stone in the larger room nor that in the chapel of St Padarn have been consecrated so neither are strictly speaking altars, and neither can be used for a Eucharistic service.|$|E

25|$|A simple cornice {{marks the}} {{roofline}} around the entire building, with modillions {{in the end}} gables. On the front side, the central bay projects to form {{the base of the}} steeple. All three bays on the front elevation have a red paneled double wooden door surrounded by fluted pilasters with a projecting cornice on top. Above each one on the second story <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>window</b> topped with semicircular fanlight. At the attic is a decorative circular light. This is echoed by a round-arched louvered vent {{on each side of the}} steeple.|$|E
25|$|Above Taylor's vaulted kitchen, {{between the}} Pillared Room and the State Dining room, Soane created a Smaller Dining Room (sometimes called the Breakfast Room) that still exists. To build it, Soane removed the chimney {{from the kitchen}} to put a door in the room. He then moved the chimney to the east side, running a Y-shaped split flue inside the walls up either side {{of one of the}} windows above. The room {{therefore}} has a unique architectural feature: over the fireplace there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>window</b> instead of the usual chimney breast.|$|E
25|$|Tales of miraculous icons are not uncommon, {{though it}} has always been {{considered}} that the message of such an event was for the immediate faithful involved and therefore does not usually attract crowds. Some miraculous icons whose reputations span long periods of time nevertheless become objects of pilgrimage along with the places where they are kept. As several Orthodox theologians and saints have explored in the past, the icon's miraculous nature is found not in the material, but in the glory of the saint who is depicted. The icon <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>window,</b> in the words of Paul Florensky, that actually participates in the glory of what it represents.|$|E

25|$|The {{process of}} {{designing}} the 'Bridge' banknotes was initiated in 2006 by the Danish National Bank. The {{theme of the}} new banknotes is Danish bridges and the surrounding landscapes, or details from these landscapes. Danish artist Karin Birgitte Lund has chosen to interpret this theme in two ways: bridges as links between various parts of Denmark and as links between {{the past and the}} present. The present is represented by the bridges, the past by five distinctive prehistoric objects found near the bridges. Among the new security features <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>window</b> thread ("Motion") with a moving wave pattern. Another feature is a new, sophisticated hologram that reflects light in different colors. The new banknotes also have the traditional security features such as the watermark and the hidden security thread.|$|E

25|$|In the past, social {{networking}} services {{were viewed as}} a distraction and offered no educational benefit. Blocking these social networks {{was a form of}} protection for students against wasting time, bullying, and invasions of privacy. In an educational setting, Facebook, for example, is seen by many instructors and educators as a frivolous, time-wasting distraction from schoolwork, and {{it is not uncommon to}} be banned in junior high or high school computer labs. Cyberbullying has become an issue of concern with {{social networking}} services. According to the UK Children Go Online survey of 9- to 19-year-olds, it was found that a third have received bullying comments online. To avoid this problem, many school districts/boards have blocked access to social networking services such as Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter within the school environment. Social networking services often include a lot of personal information posted publicly, and many believe that sharing personal information <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>window</b> into privacy theft. Schools have taken action to protect students from this. It is believed that this outpouring of identifiable information and the easy communication vehicle that social networking services opens the door to sexual predators, cyberbullying, and cyberstalking. In contrast, however, 70% of social media using teens and 85% of adults believe that people are mostly kind to one another on social network sites.|$|E

The walls are built from rubble masonry dressed with sandstone. [...] The church is now entered through a doorway at the west end of the chancel; the doorway reuses a 15th-century pointed arch. The south wall still shows where there was formerly a chapel on that side. [...] On the opposite wall, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>window</b> from the late 16th century with three lights (sections of window separated by stonework); the entrance to the north chapel has been reduced in width. The three-light east window also dates from the late 16th century. An inscribed stone above the window records the date 1598.|$|E
500|$|The church {{features}} several {{stained glass}} windows of significance. The east window, by Clayton and Bell, {{was a gift from}} Robert Treat Paine, Jr. in memory of his wife, Lydia Lyman Paine, who died in 1897 during the construction of the church. [...] At Paine's request, his wife's likeness was incorporated into the left panel of the window as a red-clad figure kneeling before Christ. [...] The west window, designed by Charles Connick, pays homage to Waltham's manufacturing history. In addition to images of Ruth, Solomon, and Noah — all industrious figures in the Bible — the window features rivets, a bicycle wheel, a watch escapement, a Metz car, and other symbols that reference Waltham's industrial character. [...] Along the south wall is a signed Tiffany window, designed by Tiffany artist Frederick Wilson. [...] The window depicts the Nativity, and was given to the church in 1908 by John H. Storer in memory of Frank Henry Perkins and Mary Ella Perkins. [...] Also along the south wall <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>window</b> by noted Boston stained glass artist Donald MacDonald. [...] This work, given in memory of Harriet K. Parmenter, depicts the Easter scene of the risen Christ revealing himself to Mary Magdalene.|$|E
500|$|While {{playing the}} game, an {{extended}} guitar neck is shown vertically {{on the screen}} (the frets horizontal), often called the [...] "note highway", and as the song progresses, colored markers or [...] "gems" [...] indicating notes travel down the screen {{in time with the}} music; the note colors and positions match those of the five fret keys on the guitar controller. Once the note(s) reach the bottom, the player must play the indicated note(s) by holding down the correct fret button(s) and hitting the strumming bar in order to score points. Success or failure will cause the on-screen Rock Meter to change, showing how well the player is playing (denoted by red, yellow, and green sections). Should the Rock Meter drop below the red section, the song will automatically end, with the player booed off the stage by the audience. Successful note hits will add to the player's score, and by hitting a long series of consecutive successful note hits, the player can increase their score multiplier. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>window</b> of time for hitting each note, similar to other rhythm games such as Dance Dance Revolution, but unlike these games, scoring in Guitar Hero is not affected by accuracy; as long as the note is hit within that window, the player receives the same number of points.|$|E
