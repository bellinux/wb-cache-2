In my research I focused on local level (NUTS V), because in many previous studies it is said, that the proces of spatial differentiation is in these days shifting from higher hiearchical levels to local level. I used the method of spatial autocorrelation because it helps to identify clusters of municipalities with high level of development potential (hot spots) or low level of development potential (cold spots) The <b>development</b> <b>poles</b> are defined as cluster of municipalities with high development potential.

They should have the role of binder between the seven poles and other small and medium-sized cities to mitigate the urban system and prevent the imbalance of development trends in the region they belong. Among the six criteria {{which led to the}} establishment of the poles municipalities and urban development is the one on "public services". Our paper aims to present a structure of this criterion, starting from its expansion by taking on analysis and commercial side of their business and services as such. Thus expanding research on the structure of the publicand commercial services on the grounds that, in fact, more and more sectors / public areas and is developing {{an important component of the}} necessity of optimizing of their own trading activities.

Spatial arrangement of public services may overlap the Galati area for which it made an map dividing the districts, including the specifying the number of inhabitants in each district that could be the beneficiaries of these services. Based on this information we can calculate specific indicators, quantitative and qualitative, of the public services of an urban <b>development</b> <b>pole.</b> Levels of theseindicators can be compared with corresponding levels of the same indicators for an urban growth pole, thereby enabling decisions to be taken to determine near optimum levels of development of the two types of cities from Romania...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyses {{the adverse}} urban social impacts generated by regional development policies in Eastern Amazonia {{and illustrated by}} the town of Parauapebas. After the military coup of 1964, Brazilian Amazonia became the centre of attention for development planning. Due to its tremendous potential of natural resources {{as well as its}} vast areas of uninhabited land, this region was regarded by military governments as a means of rapidly tackling a range of economic, social and geopolitical objectives. In this regard, several development programmes, such as the Greater Carajas Programme (PGC), were planned and implemented by the Federal government. Brazilian development policies were heavily influenced by Perroux's <b>development</b> <b>pole</b> theory, which suggested that economic growth, interregional equilibrium and integration of backward regions could be achieved through a strategy of decentralised development. This basic idea provided a convenient theoretical justification not only for economic reasons (accelerated economic growth), but also in terms of the geopolitical objectives (national integration and occupation of Amazonia) of the military regime. <b>Development</b> <b>pole</b> strategies were vigorously implemented by the Federal government through the PND II - Second National Development Plan (1975 / 79) - and these strategies continued {{with the advent of the}} PGC in the 1980 s. In order to exploit the huge iron-ore reserves at Carajes mountain, the Carajas Iron-Ore Project was established. CVRD was aware that this project would attract a considerable flow of migrants to the region and Parauapebas was built with the clear purpose of avoiding the formation an enormous shanty town at the company's entrance gate. Despite planning Parauapebas, however, CVRD could not avoid the formation of Rio Verde, a peripheral settlement contiguous to the planned town. CVRD's under-estimation of the pace of urbanisation, its decision to force service workers to live outside the company town allied to the substantial flow of migrants contributed to producing a serious situation in which the Parauapebas/Rio Verde region presented inadequate urban infrastructure and services; a critical nosological table and worrying problems in the educational sector. However, the above factors are unable to explain entirely the worrying situation in Parauapebas. In fact, these problems are a direct product of <b>development</b> <b>pole</b> strategies, which advocated that the concentration of investments in selected poles would generate economic growth, which would in turn "trickle down" to peripheral regions. Investments were made, but the beneficial spread effects in Parauapebas fell below expectations and the main reason for this lies in the fact that the ferrous-alloy industries were not implemented as originally envisaged by the PGC. As a consequence, the lack of option for diversifying the local economy is considerable. This dissertation analyses in detail the major social and environmental impacts of rapidly urban development in Parauapebas. It shows that development strategies in Eastern Amazonia have had limited positive effects and that the exploitation of the natural resources of the region has occurred in a predatory way and at the same time, it stresses that old projects and future undertakings in the region must be compatible with the environment. In this regard, this dissertation concludes with the discussion of policy implications for more sustainable policy for Eastern Amazonia...|$|E

This implies the acceptance of research efforts with epistemological frames that are diverse and often non-convergent.

We also examine how certain ideas or notions deeply affect the ways territories and identities are created, {{as well as how}} to understand social and environmental phenomena articulated within a given territory, particularly from the social imaginaries perspective. The imaginary is a concept used in sociology and philosophy (Castoriadis 1987; Habermas 1996; Taylor 2004; Anderson 1991) to refer to an intersubjectively shared notion.
