The use of a fax machine to duplicate these materials also changed the emphases of their subjects; various alarms and urban legends were propagated to distant readers over the telephone lines. This use of fax has been somewhat supplanted by email as that technology became more widely used and embedded in the culture; the sort of urban legends that once circulated by fax are now likely to appear as email hoaxes. Specific computer related alarms are the subject of virus hoaxes; email makes <b>forwarding</b> <b>of</b> <b>texts</b> relatively easy, and the frightening nature of the revelation makes it seem important to pass along, despite any doubts the sender might have.|$|E

40|$|I Abstract The {{first chapter}} of the thesis {{is devoted to the}} Flickr. com website and its {{evolution}} from its foundation until the present and to the posibility of its usage as a news source. The second chapter further explores the concept of folksonomy itself, it presents its definition, the basic approaches to its typology and singly it disserts on tag, on its forms and functions on the Flickr. com website. In the third chapter we will elaborate on the status of photography in its digital form, on its unstability and predisposition to be subject to language. The forth chapter puts <b>forward</b> the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>text</b> in the sphere of Internet, that of its nonlinearity, and it goes on about titles, captions and text as such in relation to photography. The fifth chapter then details the ability of tags to influence the perception of photography in the cyberspace and it addresses another phenomenon, that of the notes. The sixth and the last chapter presents the results of the "Flickrdream" research, whose objective was to find out to what degree are the tags in relation with photos on Flickr capable to comply with representation of such a complex phenomenon as a dream...|$|R

An {{efficient}} algorithm for automatically detecting and measuring similar/related texts would have applications in corpus linguistics, historical studies and natural language engineering. In {{an effort to}} explore the issue <b>of</b> <b>text</b> reuse, a tool, named Crouch 1, has been developed based on the TESAS system (Piao 2001) for comparing and measuring text similarity and derivation in sets <b>of</b> <b>texts.</b> Given a set of candidate source and derived texts, this tool maps related sentences between a pair <b>of</b> <b>texts</b> employing n-gram, stemming and synonym matching approaches. Crouch examines the textual similarity of individual pairs <b>of</b> <b>texts,</b> and also clusters pairs <b>of</b> <b>texts</b> in a collection <b>of</b> <b>texts</b> according to their similarity. The comparison is directional, in that the comparison from a derived text to its source generally produces a higher score than a comparison in the opposite direction. This presents the possibility of detecting the direction <b>of</b> <b>text</b> derivation.

These pictorial moments not only occur in the reader's present, {{but because of the}} way they are stylized, they are simultaneously: open windows into the historical world of the mid-twentieth century; they look backward into the classical past; and they offer a veiled look into the mystery of a Divine reality. Examination of the chronological development and refinement of Flannery O'Connor's pictorial technique by considering the meaning conveyed by the arrangement of figures in a single panel cartoon, the contextual significance found in literary tableaux and filmic montage, the use of the pictorial "camera eye," and the imprinting of tattoo on the human body, presents a new perspective in interpreting her work. Early manifestation of the pictorial technique is evident in O'Connor's college cartoons. When that cartoonist becomes a novelist that tendency for exaggeration is evident in his or her pictorial renditions of characters and situations, as is the case with former cartoonists Faulkner, Updike, West, Cantor, and O'Connor herself. O'Connor does not abandon the power of the pictorial in delivering a message. Instead she embraces it and envelops it in narrative...|$|R
