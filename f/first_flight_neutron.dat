40|$|Time of <b>flight</b> <b>neutron</b> {{diffraction}} is {{a highly}} versatile and truly non-destructive technique {{that can be used}} for quantitative analysis of grain level deformation. In the present study neutron diffraction is employed to collect information about the evolution of elastic lattice trains during in-situ fatigue cycling of stainless steel. The measured strains are interpreted through the comparison with a self-consistent polycrystal deformation model. The implications of this analysis for fatigue lifing procedures are discussed. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
