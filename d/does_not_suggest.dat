5|$|The {{view has}} been taken that judges may assign meaning to vague {{constitutional}} provisions or statutes {{on the basis of}} their own ideological preferences, hence disregarding Parliament's intention. This criticism arguably <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>suggest</b> the need to abandon interpretation by reference to the legislature's intention, but serves to highlight the importance of the need to use the power of interpretation in an appropriate manner.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} this is the {{psychology}} of perception. Scientists working in this field have discovered general principles of the perception of forms. A law of the psychology of forms says that objects that move in the same direction are perceived as related to each other. This law describes a relation between visual input and mental perceptual states. However, it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>suggest</b> anything about the nature of perceptual states. The laws discovered by psychology are compatible with all the answers to the mind–body problem already described.|$|E
5|$|According to the Augustan History, Odaenathus {{was assassinated}} by a cousin named Maeonius. In Augustan History, Odaenathus' son {{from his first}} wife was named Herodes and was crowned co-ruler by his father. The Augustan History claims that Zenobia conspired with Maeonius for a time {{because she did not}} accept her stepson as his father's heir (ahead of her own children). The Augustan History <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>suggest</b> that Zenobia was {{involved}} in the events leading to her husband's murder, and the crime is attributed to Maeonius' moral degeneration and jealousy. This account, according to historian Alaric Watson, can be dismissed as fictional. Although some modern scholarship suggests that Zenobia was involved in the assassination due to political ambition and opposition to her husband's pro-Roman policy, she continued Odaenathus' policies during her first years on the throne.|$|E

5|$|In {{many cases}} {{constant}} supervision is required because, for various reasons, such as changes in manufacturing processes, products that once were kosher may {{cease to be}} so. For example, a kosher lubricating oil may be replaced by one containing tallow, which many rabbinic authorities view as non-kosher. Such changes are often co-ordinated with the supervising rabbi, or supervising organisation, to ensure that new packaging <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>suggest</b> any hechsher or kashrut. In some cases, however, existing stocks of pre-printed labels with the hechsher may continue to be used on the now non-kosher product. An active grapevine among the Jewish community discusses which products are now questionable, as well as products which have become kosher but whose labels have yet to carry the hechsher. Some newspapers and periodicals also discuss kashrut products.|$|E

25|$|These were {{places of}} {{assembly}} in early medieval times, mostly in northern Scotland. The term (also Couthil or Cuthil) is found as a placename element at over sixty sites {{and many are}} associated with medieval shires or thanages. The term <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>suggest</b> a hill or mound site, being derived from the Gaelic term 'comhdhail', a place of assembly. Such assemblies were non-seignural burlaw courts and dealt with minor disputes.|$|E

25|$|As {{many of the}} Eastern Aramaic-speaking Assyrians who had {{converted}} to Christianity adopted Biblical (including Jewish) names, most of the early bishops had Eastern Aramaic or Jewish/Biblical names, which <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>suggest</b> {{that many of the}} early Christians in this city were converts from Judaism. It served as the seat of a Metropolitan of the Assyrian Church of the East. From the city's Christian period come many church fathers and well-known authors in Syriac.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that heterozygote carriers of the Wilson's disease gene mutation may be potentially more susceptible to elevated copper intake than the general population. A heterozygotic frequency of 1/90 people has been estimated in the overall population. However, {{there is no evidence to}} support this speculation. Further, a review of the data on single-allelic autosomal recessive diseases in humans <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>suggest</b> that heterozygote carriers are likely to be adversely affected by their altered genetic status.|$|E

25|$|The {{presence}} of artifacts that are identifiably North Germanic along the coastal areas between the Humber Estuary and East Anglia indicates that Scandinavians migrated to Britain. However, this <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>suggest</b> that {{they arrived at}} the same time as the Angles: they may have arrived almost a century later, and their status and influence upon arrival is uncertain. In particular, regarding a significant Swedish influence in association with the Sutton Hoo ship and a Swedish origin for the East Anglian Wuffinga dynasty, both possibilities are now considered uncertain.|$|E
25|$|In Egypt, for example, {{there is}} only one female senior {{executive}} among its five largest commercial enterprises. Orascom Telecom Holding Company, which is the 62nd largest company in the Muslim World (nations whose populations are predominantly Islamic), has one female member of its board of directors. This woman, Elena Shmatova, however, is neither Egyptian nor Muslim which <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>suggest</b> opportunity for female advancement. Egypt's other largest firms by revenue, Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation, Suez Canal Authority, Orascom Construction Industries, and Telekom Egypt, do not have a single female member of their board of directors or among their senior management teams.|$|E
25|$|A {{study in}} the genetic marker of the Phoenicians led by Pierre Zalloua, showed that the Phoenician genetic marker was found in 1 out of 17 males in the region {{surrounding}} the Mediterranean and Phoenician trading centers such as the Levant, Tunisia, Morocco, Cyprus, and Malta. The study focused on the male Y-chromosome of a sample of 1,330 males from the Mediterranean. Colin Groves, biological anthropologist of the Australian National University in Canberra says that the study <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>suggest</b> that the Phoenicians were restricted to a certain place, but that their DNA still lingers 3,000 years later.|$|E

25|$|Both Monemvasia and Candia have lent {{their names}} to modern grape varieties. In Greece, there is a variety known as Monemvasia, evidently named after the port, though now grown {{primarily}} in the Cyclades. In western Europe, a common variety of Malvasia is known as Malvasia Bianca di Candia (white malmsey of Crete), from its reputed origin in that area. The Monemvasia grape was long thought to be ancestral to the western European Malvasia varieties, but recent DNA analysis <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>suggest</b> a close relationship between Monemvasia and any Malvasia varieties. DNA analysis does, however, suggest that the Athiri wine grape (a variety widely planted throughout Greece) is ancestral to Malvasia.|$|E
25|$|Twin studies, {{adoption}} studies, {{and artificial}} selection {{studies have shown}} that a person's genes can predispose them to developing alcoholism. Evidence from twin studies show that concordance rates for alcoholism are higher for monozygotic twins than dizygotic twins—76% for monozygotic twins and 61% for dizygotic twins. However, female twin studies demonstrate that females have much lower concordance rates than males. Reasons for gender differences may be due to environmental factors, such as negative public attitudes towards female drinkers. Twin studies suggest that males {{are more likely to have}} a genetic predisposition for alcoholism. However, this <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>suggest</b> that a male who does have a genetic predisposition will become an alcoholic. Sometimes the individual may never encounter an environmental trigger that leads to alcoholism.|$|E
25|$|In 1885 {{the family}} left Arvier {{to work on}} the other side of the Alps, as most Valdotainians did at that time. The wish for a better life is a likely {{explanation}} but <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>suggest</b> why they travelled so far, almost to the Belgian border. Speculation surrounds the move, possibly because it was in secret. To emigrate needed authority and mayors had been told by the sub-prefect of Aoste to refuse or at least make permission difficult. If the family travelled separately, it would explain the legend that Maurice, then 14, was exchanged for a round of cheese: it could have been payment to a guide to lead him clandestinely over the mountains or payment in return for custody of the son.|$|E
