40|$|Objective: To {{present the}} nursing actions {{published}} on the <b>errors</b> <b>prevention</b> during the medications administration in the ICU. Method: This is a survey of integrative review, by including papers on nursing actions to reduce errors during the medications administration, published in the period from 2005 to 2011 and indexed in the following databases: LILACS, BDENF and SciELO. Results: we have selected and analyzed 13 papers that met the selection criteria. The discussion was designed from the types of errors. It {{became clear that the}} most cited actions to prevent errors during the medications administration were: to adopt protocols and guidelines for the medications administration; to identify the drug to be administered in the patient through barcodes; and to use incompatible connectors in different routes. Conclusion: the nursing should know the types of errors and adopt actions aimed at reducing errors the medications administration...|$|R

To specify system vulnerabilities and illustrate the potential of such an approach, we describe the root cause analysis of a case of transfusion error in emergency ward that could have been fatal. After reporting of the mentioned event, through reviewing records and interviews with the responsible personnel, the details of the incident were elaborated. Then, an expert panel meeting was held to define event timeline and the care and service delivery problems and discuss their underlying causes, safeguards and preventive measures. Root cause analysis of the mentioned event demonstrated that certain defects of the system and the ensuing errors were main causes of the event. It also points out systematic corrective actions. It can be concluded that health care organizations should endeavor to provide opportunities to discuss errors and adverse events and introduce preventive measures to find areas where resources need to be allocated to improve patient safety...|$|R

This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and {{is not to be}} disseminated broadly. Error detection serves 2 different functions: prevention and cure. Prevention engages post-error slowing to reduce future errors, whereas cure engages processes that correct the <b>error.</b> Thus, <b>prevention</b> predicts post-error slowing, and cure does not. We investigated this distinction in skilled typists in 3 experiments. In Experiment 1, post-error performance was investigated in 800 typists who completed a short continuous typing test where correction was disallowed. In Experiments 2 and 3, post-error performance and post-correction performance were investigated by manipulating whether typists were allowed to correct their mistakes. Across experiments, there was limited evidence that typists used error detection for prevention; typists preferred the cure. After making mistakes, they corrected them and rapidly resumed typing at normal rates. Post-error slowing occurred only when correction was disabled; post-error speeding occurred when correction was enabled. This finding offers support for the novel hypothesis that post-error slowing reflects the inhibition of pre-potent tendencies to correct mistakes. Error-detection processes in general will be better understood by distinguishing between tasks that allow performers to cure their errors through correction rather than reduce their <b>errors</b> through <b>prevention...</b>|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Medicine administeration is an {{important}} part of treatment and nursing care process and medication errors is a serious threat in health and patient safety and also in nursing profession. This study carried out to investigate the nurse,s view about factors affects medication errors in different care units of Imam Hossein hospital in Shahroud. Methods: This study is a descriptive analytic and cross-sectional study that has been done on 40 nurses who they work in different care units of Imam Hossein hospital in Shahrood. Subjects were selected in unrandomized sampling and their points of view about factors affect medication errors were measured by using a designed questionnaire. Data was analyzed by using descriptive and analytic statitic methods in SPSS software. Results: Upon to results, the majority of subjects mentioned that factors such as: Fatigue arised from overtime work (66. 7 %), deficiency number of nurses comparison number of patient (59 %), psychological stress of nurse (48. 7 %), illegible physician order in patients file (42. 5 %) and lack of enough time (42. 1 %) are the most important factors that caused medication errors. Also, the majority of subjects mentioned that factors such as: Type of drug arrangement in drug shelf (47. 4 %), incorrect work devision in unit (46. 2 %), drug room environment (light, area, …) (46. 2 %) and type of prescription (intravascular, intramuscular,…) (36. 1 %) are the least important factors that caused medication errors. Subjects explained that factors such as: Morning shift (48. 7 %) and drug protocol (38. 9 %) were not effective in causing medication errors. There weren,t significant correlation between medication errors factors and demographic variables.

40|$|Medication Reconciliation {{has emerged}} as a major patient safety goal in the {{management}} of medication <b>errors</b> and <b>prevention</b> of adverse drug events. The medication reconciliation process supports the task of detecting and correcting potential mistakes in a patient’s medication list so that physicians can make correct, consistent, timely and safe prescribing decisions. Maintaining an accurate list of a patient’s medications is a very challenging task for which the current solution is a process driven approach. In prior work, we proposed a promising data driven approach through the use of collaborative filtering algorithms to improve the accuracy of the medication list. This is analogous to the framework used by online retailers to recommend relevant products to customers. In this paper, we extend our original framework to include other types of patient information, develop some new collaborative filtering approaches and test them using medication data from a long-term care clinic. The results are encouraging and suggest several promising directions for the future, including embedding these methods in current medication reconciliation processes and evaluating them in actual clinical settings...|$|R
