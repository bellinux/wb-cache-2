5|$|Social pragmatic theories, also in {{contrast}} to the constraints view, focus on the social context in which the infant is embedded. According to this approach, environmental input removes the ambiguity of the word learning situation. Cues such as the caregiver's gaze, body language, <b>gesture,</b> <b>and</b> smile help infants to understand the meanings of words. Social pragmatic theories stress the role of the caregiver in talking about objects, actions, or events that the infant is already focused-in upon.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{criticism}} of Albrecht and the event it portrayed, the painting often {{is seen as}} strongly anti-Prussian. While it appears to glorify Poland, it is also critical of the country. Matejko went beyond portraying the glory of a historical event and attempted to convey hints of how the country's history would play out in the future. This event was merely a hollow victory that failed to secure Poland's future. Matejko shows that the homage was an empty <b>gesture</b> <b>and</b> that it was Prussia that exploited it rather than Poland. Nobody in the painting is smiling except a lady of the court who is engaged in idle gossip.|$|E
5|$|Springbok mate year-round, though {{females are}} more likely to enter oestrus during the rainy season, when food is more plentiful. Females are able to {{conceive}} at as early as six to seven months, whereas males do not attain sexual maturity until two years; rut lasts 5 to 21 days. When a female approaches a rutting male, the male holds his head and tail at level with the ground, lowers his horns, and makes a loud grunting noise to attract her. The male then urinates and sniffs the female's perineum. If the female is receptive, she urinates, as well, and the male makes a flehmen <b>gesture,</b> <b>and</b> taps his leg till the female leaves or permits him to mate. Copulation consists of a single pelvic thrust.|$|E
40|$|<b>Gestures</b> <b>and</b> speech {{are mostly}} well-aligned. However, during {{difficult}} tasks, gesture-speech mismatches occur. This study investigates the dynamic interplay between <b>gestures</b> <b>and</b> speech as 12 children perform a hands-on air pressure task. We applied Cross Recurrence Quantification Analysis {{on the time}} series of understanding levels displayed in <b>gestures</b> <b>and</b> speech. We focused on: 1) the temporal relation between <b>gestures</b> <b>and</b> speech, 2) the relative strength {{and direction of the}} coupling between <b>gestures</b> <b>and</b> speech (overall and for different levels of understanding), and 3) the relations between recurrence measures and some child characteristics. Strength, direction, and timing of the coupling between <b>gestures</b> <b>and</b> speech were different for younger and older children, as well as for children who performed well on math and past tasks, or on a language task. We suggest that the observed asymmetric dynamic attunement reflects the simultaneous and at times competing coordination of synergies for <b>gestures</b> <b>and</b> speech instead of a disembodied cognitive capacity...|$|R
40|$|Two {{eye-tracking}} experiments investigated how <b>and</b> when pointing <b>gestures</b> <b>and</b> location descriptions affect target identification. The experiments {{investigated the}} effect of <b>gestures</b> <b>and</b> referring expressions on {{the time course of}} fixations to the target, using videos of human <b>gestures</b> <b>and</b> human voice, <b>and</b> animated <b>gestures</b> <b>and</b> synthesized speech. Ambiguous, yet informative pointing <b>gestures</b> elicited attention <b>and</b> facilitated target identification, akin to verbal location descriptions. Moreover, target identification was superior when both pointing <b>gestures</b> <b>and</b> verbal location descriptions were used. These findings suggest that gesture not only operates as a context to verbal descriptions, or that verbal descriptions operate as a context to gesture, but that they complement one another in reference resolution...|$|R
40|$|Gesture {{comprehension}} remains understudied, {{particularly in}} children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) who have difficulties in gesture production. Using a novel gesture comprehension task, Study 1 examined how 2 - to 4 -year-old typically-developing (TD) children comprehend types of <b>gestures</b> <b>and</b> gesture-speech combinations, and showed better comprehension of deictic <b>gestures</b> <b>and</b> reinforcing gesture-speech combinations than iconic/conventional <b>gestures</b> <b>and</b> supplementary gesture-speech combinations at each age. Study 2 compared verbal children with ASD to TD children, comparable in receptive language ability, and showed similar patterns of comprehension in each group. Our results suggest that children comprehend deictic <b>gestures</b> <b>and</b> reinforcing gesture-speech combinations better than iconic/conventional <b>gestures</b> <b>and</b> supplementary combinations-a pattern that remains robust across different ages within TD children and children with ASD...|$|R
5|$|Throughout {{the early}} part of the century, Wood was {{influential}} in changing the habits of concertgoers. Until then it had been customary for audiences at symphony or choral concerts to applaud after each movement or section. Wood discouraged this, sometime by <b>gesture</b> <b>and</b> sometimes by specific request printed in programmes. For this he was much praised in the musical and national press. In addition to his work at the Queen's Hall, Wood conducted at the Sheffield, Norwich, Birmingham, Wolverhampton, and Westmorland festivals, and at orchestral concerts in Cardiff, Manchester, Liverpool, Leicester and Hull. His programming was summarised in The Manchester Guardian, which listed the number of each composer's works played in the 1911 Proms season; the top ten were: Wagner (121); Beethoven (34); Tchaikovsky (30); Mozart (28); Dvořák (16); Weber (16); J.S. Bach (14); Brahms (14); Elgar (14); and Liszt (13).|$|E
5|$|A {{social worker}} announces to Brian {{and the rest}} of his family that Brian is sentenced to be put down by a lethal injection, which shocks everyone. While Peter works on Brian's appeal, Brian decides to study the Law as much as he can, and goes to court to defend himself, and finally gets the chance to plead his case before the Quahog City Council. During his parole hearing, he {{references}} the court case Plessy v. Ferguson, but unfortunately for him, the council believes that it's stupid to listen to a dog. Just when Brian is about to be dismissed, Peter steps in and delivers a last-ditch emotional appeal on his behalf. The city council members remain unmoved until Peter bribes them with $20 each, and Brian is immediately freed. The charges against him are finally dropped and the town shows him new respect, allowing him to finally drink out of a water fountain, showing his status to be the same as that of the other citizens of the community. The family returns home and Stewie, in an unusual (at the time) display of respect towards Brian, bows ever so slightly towards him. Brian and Peter are then left alone. Brian licks Peter's face in an endearing dog <b>gesture,</b> <b>and</b> threatens to kill him if he ever tells anyone about it.|$|E
5|$|Rainilaiarivony's first royal wife, Queen Rasoherina, died on 1 April 1868, and was {{succeeded by}} her cousin RanavalonaII (crowned on 3 September 1868) who, like Rasoherina, was a widow of RadamaII. RanavalonaII was a pupil of Protestant missionaries and had {{converted}} to Christianity. Rainilaiarivony recognized the growing power of Christianity {{on the island}} and identified the need to bring it under his influence in order to avert destabilizing cultural and political power struggles. The Prime Minister encouraged the new queen to Christianize the court through a public baptism ceremony at Andohalo on 21 February 1869, the day of their marriage. In this ceremony the supernatural royal talismans were ordered to be destroyed and replaced by the Bible. The Christianization of the court and the establishment of the independent royal Protestant chapel on the palace grounds prompted the wide-scale conversion {{of hundreds of thousands of}} Malagasy. These conversions were commonly motivated by a desire to express political allegiance to the Crown, and as such were largely nominal, with the majority of converts practicing a syncretic blend of Christian and traditional religions. Rainilaiarivony's biographers conclude that the Prime Minister's own conversion was also largely a political <b>gesture</b> <b>and</b> most likely did not denote a genuine spiritual shift until late in his life, if ever. Some local officials attempted to force conversions to Protestantism by mandating church attendance and persecuting Catholics, but Rainilaiarivony quickly responded to quell these overzealous practices. The Prime Minister's criminalization of polygamy and alcohol consumption, as well as the declaration of Sunday as a day of rest, were likewise inspired by the growing British and Protestant influences in the country. The Christianization of the court came at a steep personal price: with the outlawing of polygamy, Rainilaiarivony was forced to repudiate his first wife. The Prime Minister was deeply saddened by this necessity and by the consequent souring of his relationships with Rasoanalina and their children after the divorce.|$|E
40|$|As {{children}} learn {{they use their}} speech to express words and their hands to gesture. This study investigates the interplay between real-time <b>gestures</b> <b>and</b> speech as children construct cognitive understanding during a hands-on science task. 12 children (M = 6, F = 6) from Kindergarten (n = 5) and first grade (n = 7) participated in this study. Each verbal utterance <b>and</b> <b>gesture</b> during the task were coded, on a complexity scale derived from dynamic skill theory. To explore the interplay between speech <b>and</b> <b>gestures,</b> we applied a cross recurrence quantification analysis (CRQA) to the two coupled time series of the skill levels of verbalizations <b>and</b> <b>gestures.</b> The analysis focused on (1) the temporal relation between <b>gestures</b> <b>and</b> speech, (2) the relative strength {{and direction of the}} interaction between <b>gestures</b> <b>and</b> speech, (3) the relative strength <b>and</b> direction between <b>gestures</b> <b>and</b> speech for different levels of understanding, and (4) relations between CRQA measures and other child characteristics. The results show that older and younger children differ in the (temporal) asymmetry in the gestures–speech interaction. For younger children, the balance leans more toward gestures leading speech in time, while the balance leans more toward speech leading gestures for older children. Secondly, at the group level, speech attracts gestures in a more dynamically stable fashion than vice versa, and this asymmetry in <b>gestures</b> <b>and</b> speech extends to lower and higher understanding levels. Yet, for older children, the mutual coupling between <b>gestures</b> <b>and</b> speech is more dynamically stable regarding the higher understanding levels. <b>Gestures</b> <b>and</b> speech are more synchronized in time as children are older. A higher score on schools’ language tests is related to speech attracting <b>gestures</b> more rigidly <b>and</b> more asymmetry between <b>gestures</b> <b>and</b> speech, only for the less difficult understanding levels. A higher score on math or past science tasks is related to less asymmetry between <b>gestures</b> <b>and</b> speech. The picture that emerges from our analyses suggests that the relation between <b>gestures,</b> speech <b>and</b> cognition is more complex than previously thought. We suggest that temporal differences and asymmetry in influence between <b>gestures</b> <b>and</b> speech arise from simultaneous coordination of synergies...|$|R

There was surprising uniformity and simplicity in the <b>gestures</b> <b>and</b> speech.

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that addressees in interaction integrate the semantic information conveyed by speakers’ gestures. Little is known, however, about {{whether and how}} addressees’ attention to <b>gestures</b> <b>and</b> the integration of gestural information can be modulated. This study examines {{the influence of a}} social factor (speakers’ gaze to their own <b>gestures),</b> <b>and</b> two physical factors (the gesture’s location in <b>gesture</b> space <b>and</b> gestural holds) on addressees’ overt visual attention to gestures (direct fixations of <b>gestures)</b> <b>and</b> their uptake of gestural information. It also examines the relationship between gaze and uptake. The results indicate that addressees’ overt visual attention to gestures is affected both by speakers’ gaze and holds but for different reasons, whereas location in space plays no role. Addressees’ uptake of gesture information is only influenced by speakers’ gaze. There is little evidence of a direct relationship between addressees’ direct fixations of <b>gestures</b> <b>and</b> their uptake...|$|R

Given the fact that Chant was learned in an oral tradition in which the texts and melodies were sung from memory, this was obviously not necessary.
