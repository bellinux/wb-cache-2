5|$|Roy of the Rovers Annuals were {{produced}} {{every year from}} 1958 until 1994, and again in 2000. A number of tie-in books were also published, including a handful of paperback prose storybooks in 1977 and 1993, and two football quiz books in 1978 and 1979. Roy of the Rovers never made the leap <b>from</b> <b>page</b> to screen, although he did make an appearance on the BBC comedy sports quiz They Think It's All Over in 1999, {{in the form of}} a cardboard cut-out. on 10 October 2006.|$|E
5|$|This {{language}} is not from the Court’s opinion in Lucas v. Earl. Instead, it is an almost direct quotation <b>from</b> <b>page</b> 17 of the taxpayer's brief filed in the case. Guy C. Earl was the taxpayer, and the brief was written by Earl’s attorneys: Warren Olney Jr., J.M. Mannon, Jr., and Henry D. Costigan. In some printed versions of the case, this statement and other quotations and paraphrases from pages 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 18 of the taxpayer's brief are re-printed as a headnote or syllabus above {{the opinion of the}} Court. In the case reprints that include this headnote (and many of them do not even show it), these excerpts are not clearly identified as being from the taxpayer's brief. A person not trained in analysis of legal materials would not necessarily know that this verbiage, like any headnote or syllabus, {{is not part of the}} Court’s opinion, perhaps leading to the confusion about the source of the quotation. As explained below, the Supreme Court rejected the arguments in the quotation, and the taxpayer lost the case.|$|E

25|$|The Marine Corps {{established}} a glider program in April 1942. Eventually they set goals of having 10,800 Marines qualified as glider infantry, with 1,371 gliders and 3,436 pilots.

25|$|The team's first feud {{was against}} the Midnight Rockers, whom they {{defeated}} for the AWA World Tag Team Championship on March 19, 1988. During their year-long title reign Badd Company would feud heavily with Chavo and Mando Guerrero and the team known as the Top Guns (Ricky Rice and Derrick Dukes). They faced the team of the Top Guns and Wendi Richter (they teamed with Madusa Miceli) at the only AWA pay-per-view SuperClash III. Both Badd Company’s Tag-Team Title and Wendi Richter’s AWA World Women's Championship were on the line, but since Richter pinned Miceli Badd Company remained the champions. Diamond and Tanaka’s reign ended on March 25, 1989 as they lost to the Olympians (Brad Rheingans and Ken Patera). Shortly after losing their titles they split <b>from</b> <b>Page,</b> and had a short feud against each other before wrestling in singles competition until early 1990.|$|E
25|$|In 1993 Indigo {{launched}} the E-Print 1000 at IPEX trade show. The E-Print 1000 eliminated the expense and labor of the plate-printing setup process, printing {{directly from a}} computer file, and enabled inexpensive short-run color printing. Images not only could be readily changed, they could be changed <b>from</b> <b>page</b> to page, requiring neither additional setup or pauses in the print run. Instead of printing to metal plates, the E-Print created a latent image on the Photo Imaging Plate or PIP {{through the use of}} an electrostatic charge. This charged area would then attract the charged ElectroInk, which would in turn be transferred to the ITM or blanket, and then again transfer from the blanket to the paper or other substrate. Because 100% of the ink transfers from PIP to blanket to substrate, a different image and color could be printed with each rotation of the press. At the same time, Indigo's ElectroInk-based color inks offered print quality rivaling that of traditional printing processes. Almost 20 years later, and despite the numerous technological improvements, Indigo presses are still based on this core technology.|$|E
25|$|Servetus was {{the first}} European to {{describe}} the function of pulmonary circulation, although his achievement was not widely recognized at the time, for a few reasons. One was that the description appeared in a theological treatise, Christianismi Restitutio, not in a book on medicine. However, the sections in which he refers to anatomy and medicines demonstrate an amazing understanding {{of the body and}} treatments. Most copies of the book were burned shortly after its publication in 1553 because of persecution of Servetus by religious authorities. Three copies survived, but these remained hidden for decades. In passage V, Servetus recounts his discovery that the blood of the pulmonary circulation flows from the heart to the lungs (rather than air in the lungs flowing to the heart as had been thought). His discovery was based on the colour of the blood, the size and location of the different ventricles, {{and the fact that the}} pulmonary vein was extremely large, which suggested that it performed intensive and transcendent exchange. However, Servetus does not only deal with cardiology. In the same passage, <b>from</b> <b>page</b> 169 to 178, he also refers to the brain, the cerebellum, the meninges, the nerves, the eye, the tympanum, the rete mirabile, etc., demonstrating a great knowledge of anatomy. In some other sections of this work he also talks of medical products.|$|E

500|$|Schumann, {{the last}} sonatas' dedicatee, {{reviewed}} {{the works in}} his Neue Zeitschrift für Musik in 1838, upon their publication. He {{seems to have been}} largely disappointed by the sonatas, criticizing their [...] "much greater simplicity of invention" [...] and Schubert's [...] "voluntary renunciation of shining novelty, where he usually sets himself such high standards", and claiming the sonatas [...] "ripple along <b>from</b> <b>page</b> to page as if without end, never in doubt as to how to continue, always musical and singable, interrupted here and there by stirrings of some vehemence which, however, are rapidly stilled". Schumann's criticism seems to fit the general negative attitude maintained towards these works during the nineteenth century.|$|E
500|$|The Hunting Party is a {{departure}} from the electronic rock sound of the band's previous two studio albums, A Thousand Suns (2010) and Living Things (2012).

Packaged by an artwork by Brandon Parvini based on an original drawing by James Jean, the album took under a year to record and produce, with material being improvisationally written by the band. The album also features guest appearances <b>from</b> <b>Page</b> Hamilton of Helmet, Daron Malakian of System of a Down, Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine, and Rakim, marking the first time Linkin Park has collaborated with other artists on a studio album.|$|E
