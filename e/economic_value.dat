40|$|A bio-economic model {{based on}} a {{deterministic}} approach was adapted to estimate <b>economic</b> <b>values</b> for important traits of Menz and Horro which are indigenous sheep breeds of Ethiopia. A meat sheep with lamb fattening and rearing of young sheep for replacement was modeled. Traits considered were fattening (daily gain), live weight (ewe mature live weight) and functional traits (length of productive life, lambing interval, and litter size, stillbirth and lamb survival). <b>Economic</b> <b>values</b> were derived independently to avoid double counting and <b>economic</b> <b>values</b> were obtained (in €) per ewe place and year and genetic standard deviation. Negative <b>economic</b> <b>values</b> for length of productive life and ewe mature live weight were obtained for both breeds. For Menz, <b>economic</b> <b>values</b> per genetic standard deviation were 0. 63 (daily gain), - 0. 77 (mature ewe live weight), - 0. 97 (length of productive life), 1. 57 (lambing interval), 0. 98 (litter size), 0. 41 (stillbirth) and 2. 20 (lamb survival). Furthermore, <b>economic</b> <b>values</b> of 1. 35 (daily gain), - 1. 26 (mature ewe live weight), - 1. 15 (length of productive life), 1. 98 (lambing interval), 3. 67 (litter size), 0. 56 (stillbirth) and 3. 25 (lamb survival) were achieved for Horro. Setting <b>economic</b> <b>values</b> of length of productive life and mature ewe live weight to zero, relative <b>economic</b> <b>values</b> for the trait complexes (in %) fattening: functional were 11 : 89 and 12. 5 : 87. 5 for Menz and Horro sheep, respectively. <b>Economic</b> <b>values</b> for litter size, lambing interval and lamb survival were sensitive to Changes of prices of breeding rams in both breeds...|$|R

This species lacks <b>economic</b> <b>value</b> but is caught incidentally in bottom trawls, which it is thought to be less able to withstand than other maskrays due to its gracile build.

An oviparous species, the female retains her eggs internally until the embryos are at an advanced state of development, resulting in a relatively short hatching time after laying. Between 12 and 22 encapsulated eggs are produced at a time, which the female attaches to the bottom. The tiger catshark is caught incidentally by commercial and recreational fishers but has no <b>economic</b> <b>value.</b> It has been listed as Data Deficient by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), pending more information.|$|E
40|$|<b>Economic</b> <b>values</b> for {{production}} traits (carrier, fat, protein, and dressing percentage) and functional traits (conception rate, survival rate, body weight, and rumen capacity) {{were calculated for}} Holstein cattle of Costa Rica. <b>Economic</b> <b>values</b> were derived using a bio-economic model that combined genetic potential performance, feeding strategies and optimum culling and insemination policies to obtain actual phenotypic performance. Two evaluation bases were considered: fixed herd-size and fixed milk-output. With a fixed herd-size <b>economic</b> <b>values</b> were 0. 04 (carrier), 5. 25 (fat), 3. 95 (protein), 0. 92 (dressing percentage), 1. 30 (conception rate), 2. 42 (survival rate), 0. 81 (body weight) and 84. 53 (rumen capacity). With a milk-output limitation, <b>economic</b> <b>values</b> for all traits except survival rate were lower than for fixed herd-size. The respective values were - 0. 04, 3. 53, 2. 91, 0. 88, 0. 85, 3. 18, 0. 51 and 45. 59. Sensitivity analysis indicated that <b>economic</b> <b>values</b> of fat, protein and rumen capacity increased significantly with higher prices of milk solids. Other traits were less sensitive {{to a change in}} price of milk solids. Changes in price of concentrate did not alter <b>economic</b> <b>values</b> significantly. Under a fixed feeding strategy, <b>economic</b> <b>values</b> for functional traits increased substantially, while those {{for production}} traits decreased. The results of this analysis suggest that genetic improvement of fertility, health and cow-efficiency traits will have a clear positive effect on profitability of Holstein cows in Costa Rica, especially when feeding conditions are not optimal.

Field recorded data were obtained from the Programme d'Analyse des Troupeaux Laitiers du Quebec (PATLQ) and genetic evaluation data were obtained from the Canadian Dairy Network (CDN). After the editing procedure, the data set consisted of 195, 001 lifetime records of Holstein, Ayrshire, Jersey, Brown Swiss and Canadienne cows which calved for the first time between January 1980 and December 1994. Different profitability measurements were computed and used as the dependent variables in covariance model to compute different sets of <b>economic</b> <b>values.</b> Since the majority of cows produced 5 lactations or less, results obtained by using lifetime profits and profits until the end of the fifth lactation are similar. A kilogram genetic increase in fat production had higher <b>economic</b> <b>values</b> than the same increase in milk production in all breeds. A unit genetic increase in conformation had the highest positive impact on profit while a same increase in capacity had a negative impact on profit. Results obtained by using lifetime profit adjusted for the opportunity cost of postponed replacement showed that this adjustement reduced the influence of type traits on profit. Finally, profits of first lactations were used to study consequences of changes in pricing systems occurred in Quebec in August 1992. <b>Economic</b> <b>values</b> attached to protein production changed drastically.
