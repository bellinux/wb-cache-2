For example, SIG becomes the largest shareholder of Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Co., Ltd., Shanghai Rural Commercial Bank Co., Ltd., Guotai Junan Securities Co., Ltd., Anxin Agricultural Insurance Co., Ltd., Dazhong Insurance Co., Ltd. and other companies. SIG set up two joint ventures. One is China International Fund Management Co., Ltd. with JP Morgan {{which is one}} of the world’s asset management companies. The other refers to Tullett Prebon SITICO (China) Ltd., the first <b>inter-dealer</b> <b>broker</b> in China, with Tullett Prebon (Europe) Ltd., a company of Collins Stewart Tullett Group which is the second <b>inter-dealer</b> <b>broker</b> in the world.

InterVest’s Web-based system was sold to GFI Group, Inc., an <b>inter-dealer</b> <b>broker.</b> The court ultimately found that InterVest had not provided sufficient evidence to prove, beyond reasonable doubt, that Cowen had committed an antitrust violation. Cowen was granted summary judgment.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two classes}} of members on CREST: members and {{sponsored}} members. Members are usually pension funds, <b>inter-dealer</b> <b>brokers</b> or other large financial institutions with significant resources. Sponsored members {{have the same rights}} and responsibilities as members. However, given {{that they do not have}} the financial or technical resources of the full members, they rely on their sponsoring member to interface with CREST.|$|R
50|$|Generally it is {{impossible}} to close two or three transactions at the same instant; therefore, there is the possibility that when one part of the deal is closed, a quick shift in prices makes it impossible to close the other at a profitable price. However, this is not necessarily the case. Many exchanges and <b>inter-dealer</b> <b>brokers</b> allow multi legged trades (e.g. basis block trades on LIFFE).|$|R
50|$|For {{instruments}} {{which are}} not exchange-traded (e.g. US treasury bonds), the inter-dealer market substitutes for the exchange. This is where dealers trade directly with one another or through <b>inter-dealer</b> <b>brokers</b> (i.e. companies like GFI Group, ICAP and BGC Partners. They acted as middle-men between dealers such as investment banks). This type of trading traditionally took place over the phone but brokers moved to offering electronic trading services instead.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{transmission}} of macroeconomic factors into the price-setting behavior of a specific dealer in the FX market. This problem is viewed {{from the perspective of}} a central banker who observes the price evolution but does not make the market in the home currency. The central banker's task is to explain the forex behavior in terms of conventional economic logic. The analysis is based on a model of a multiple dealer market under two organizations - direct <b>inter-dealer</b> and <b>brokered.</b> The model is constructed in such a way as to reflect the most prominent features of the market for the Czech koruna and, accordingly, to address some issues of key relevance to the Czech National Bank's exchange rate policy. We show that the totality of the exchange rate-relevant fundamental factors influence the market maker's behavior through a single sufficient statistic, his 'marginal' valuation of foreign currency holdings. Under the two studied trading mechanisms, the marginal valuations across market participants determine the equilibrium exchange rate by means of different trade patterns. Specifically, the brokered market is inferior to the direct one in terms of welfare improvement through trade. It takes a higher inter-dealer trade volume in the brokered market to absorb a new price impulse. Therefore, the central banker would do best by monitoring the brokered segment (as the only partially transparent one available), but by conducting interventions in the direct segment, where the desired impact is easier to achieve. forex microstructure, multiple dealership, order flow, pricing schedule. ...|$|R
50|$|Hayes traded {{derivatives}} at UBS and, later, Citigroup, in Tokyo. His favoured {{activity was}} basis trading, speculation on the movements in Libor expressed in multiple currencies and various durations, trades he might hedge with trades in other derivatives. The daily reporting of Libor rates by bankers {{around the world}} determined his success or failure in generating profits for his bank and bonuses for himself. By September 2008, a one basis point (1/100 of one per cent) move in Libor had about a US$750,000 effect on his bottom line. Through a network of his broker contacts, including one at the world's largest <b>inter-dealer</b> <b>broker,</b> ICAP, he succeeded in having Libor reported lower than its true level in order to drive his profits and personal bonuses higher.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{sovereign}} segment of the credit default swap (CDS) market, examining data covering several years of quotes and trades from an important CDS <b>inter-dealer</b> <b>broker.</b> Compared to corporate or bank CDSs, sovereign CDSs are concentrated in fewer names and in contracts with reference assets of relatively short maturity, apparently {{a result of the}} fairly high proportion of low-rated sovereigns that tend to issue at short maturities. In addition, spreads on CDSs written on very low-rated sovereigns tend to be significantly wider than on those written on correspondingly low-rated corporates, consistent with the market being less sure about the consequences of sovereign default. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{dealership}} markets share three common features: customer-dealer trades remain undisclosed, inter-dealer trading forms {{a substantial part}} of total trading and dealers have a choice, when dealing with each other, between doing so directly and using an <b>inter-dealer</b> <b>broker</b> (IDB). Using a three-stage market microstructure model, we show that for dealers who have executed undisclosed customer trades, their choice depends on the number of firms who operate as dealers: trading through the IDB being preferable when more than a critical number of dealers participate in the industry and vice versa. Comparative static effects of information asymmetry and market transparency on the critical number of dealers are derived. Subject to a monotonicity constraint, a condition is derived determining which form of inter-dealer market will prevail. ...|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to the film's detractors, Boxoffice Magazine journalist Pete Hammond said the film was [...] "brilliantly cast" [...] and labeled it a [...] "crackerjack powerhouse of a movie that shines a light on the financial machinations". He stated that Douglas does not lose any of the substance of Gekko and LaBeouf is firm as Jacob. The writer predicted the Wall Street sequel's box office performance would be brisk, while the prospects were assured on DVD. Andrew O'Hehir's of Salon.com reviewed the film from Cannes, calling it an [...] "ambitious, uneven, surprisingly talky melodrama, which mixes a quasi-documentary approach to the crash of 2008 with the story." [...] O'Hehir's considered the film to express a more [...] "personal, intimate sense of moral hazard". Marshall Fine, writing in the Huffington Post, viewed the film as an [...] "overstuffed blend of agitprop and melodrama" [...] that contains a cautionary story pertaining to unchecked capitalism. He considered Stone to be proclaiming a message of the [...] "cancerous effects of greed". Bill Goodykoontz of Arizona Republic admitted {{that he was not}} surprised to see that the sequel is not as effective as its predecessor, though it was an engaging film at the top of its game when it is hostile, and less satisfying during romantic parts. He ended by saying {{that it is not a}} [...] "great movie", but explained that it is an [...] "effective commentary on what greed cost" [...] everyone. CEO of Tullett Prebon, Terry Smith, one of the largest <b>inter-dealer</b> money <b>brokers</b> in the world, reviewed the movie for Today on BBC Radio 4. He gave it three out of five saying that, although it was [...] "a little bit corny in some respects", it puts the events of the credit crunch into context and that [...] "it rings reasonably true," [...] capturing some of the activities, the moods and the individuals quite well." ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{advances}} {{the literature}} by applying agent-based simulation to market microstructure issues. Although {{most of the}} agent-based literature focuses only on generating market dynamics that best resemble those in the real world, a trading structure is presumed to be a Walrasian auction {{in most of the}} published literature. This thesis argues that the institutional details of trading are relevant, and need to be reflected when modeling agent behavior in trading models. Chapter 2 compares the convergence property in a double-auction market versus a Walrasian market. This chapter constructs an artificial equity market in which agents trade a risky asset that pays a stochastic dividend each period. In some of the experiments, market dynamics under double-auction converge to the Rational Expectation Equilibrium. However, this convergence is sensitive to deviations from rationality. In experiments where we introduce noise trading, convergence becomes unattainable. Minimal rationality is not sufficient to generate convergence in a double-auction market when the market price is endogenous. Chapter 3 constructs a three-stage model of a dealership market. After trading with the customer, the dealer chooses between trading in a quote-driven inter-dealer market or in an order-driven <b>brokered</b> <b>inter-dealer</b> market. We show that the dealers choice of inter dealer markets depends on the number of dealers available to make the market. This condition determines which inter-dealer market will prevail. We also demonstrate the conditions for the existence of the equilibrium number of dealers that enter the market making industry. At equilibrium, an increase in risk-aversion, the volatility of the customer order flow and asset shifts inter-dealer trading from the direct market to the broker. Moreover, customers are better off when dealers have a choice between two inter-dealer trading venues. Building on this theoretical framework, an agent-based simulation is employed to investigate the welfare effects of heterogeneous dealers under different transparency regimes. Chapter 4 examines the factors that affect liquidity-motivated investors preference between a dealership market and a limit-order book market. This study builds on the theoretical market microstructure literature and uses an agent-based computational approach that allows us to examine the equilibrium properties of models that are richer than the extant literature in terms of the heterogeneity of trading and customer attributes. We find that an increase in the thickness of the market, correlated customer order flow and a {{decrease in the number of}} dealers cause a rise in the probability of an order book system prevailing. We also find that large-size customer orders and an increase in the degree of dealer heterogeneity are more likely to shift trades to a dealership system...|$|R
40|$|A common {{belief is}} to qualify the credit default swap(CDS) market as very liquid. However, looking at intra-daily CDS data on {{individual}} firms {{from a major}} <b>inter-dealer</b> <b>broker,</b> we find only limited support for this view. In fact, bid-ask spreads and daily number of trades in our CDS data are more comparable to corporate bond markets than to equity markets. To dig deeper in our data set, we estimate a state-space model of CDS bid and ask quotes on our data. Our model allows for price discreteness, data-errors, heterogeneity of the quotes, jumps in the efficient spreads and intra-daily patterns both in the volatility of the efficient CDS premium and proportional transaction costs. We estimate the model using particle filtering and the Monte Carlo EM algorithm. The volatility of the efficient premium and transaction costs exhibit the usual J-shaped intra-daily pattern observed in equity markets. Also, volatility is much lower during overnight periods and transaction costs much higher...|$|E
40|$|A price {{pressure}} effect is implied by segmentation {{in the market}} for a security. An empirical property of a segmented market is that the price of the security is sensitive to supply and demand conditions for that specific security, absent changes in risk and absent any new information. This paper examines intra-day trading data from the <b>inter-dealer</b> <b>broker</b> market for U. S. Treasury securities and finds that there is a price {{pressure effect}} in the off-the-run Treasury market. Thus, securities that would appear to be very close substitutes, i. e., on-the-run and off-the-run Treasury bonds, behave as if there is some degree of market segmentation. There have been several studies of price pressure in the equity market and Treasury bill market but this is the first study of the off-the-run Treasury note and bond market to investigate a price pressure effect using intra-day data. It is also the first study to analyze price pressure through matched pairs of securities that differ only in liquidity and with high frequency data. ...|$|E
