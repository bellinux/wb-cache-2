To explore in detail the relationships connecting materials to the products that require them, we map supply chains for five product platforms (a cadmium telluride solar cell, a <b>germanium</b> <b>solar</b> <b>cell,</b> a turbine blade, a lead acid battery, and a hard drive (HD) magnet) using a data ontology that specifies the supply chain actors (nodes) and linkages (e. g., material exchange and contractual relationships) among them. We then propose a set of network indicators (product complexity, producer diversity, supply chain length, and potential bottlenecks) to assess the situation for each platform in the overall supply chain networks. Among the results of interest are the following: (1) the turbine blade displays a high product complexity, defined by the material linkages to the platform; (2) the <b>germanium</b> <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> is produced by only a few manufacturers globally and requires more physical transformation steps than do the other project platforms; (3) including production quantity and sourcing countries in the assessment shows that a large portion of nodes of the supply chain of the hard-drive magnet are located in potentially unreliable countries. We conclude by discussing how the network analysis of supply chains could be combined with criticality and scenario analyses of abiotic raw materials to comprise a comprehensive picture of product platform risk...|$|E
40|$|The {{radiative}} recombination limit described by Shockley and Queisser (SQ) provides the maximum efficiency for {{the conversion of}} sunlight into electricity by a solar cell. This maximum efficiency depends only on the radiation balance between the sun, the solar cell, and ambient.

The calculated efficiency limits of c-Si solar cells with directionally and spectrally selective filters are presented.

In this paper the operation of {{amorphous silicon}} <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> is briefly described.

40|$|<b>Germanium</b> <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> {{are used}} as bottom subcells in many multijunction <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> designs. The {{question}} remains whether the thermal load originated by {{the growth of the}} upper layers of the multijunction <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> structure affects the Ge subcell performance. Here, we report and analyze the performance degradation of the Ge subcell due to such thermal load in lattice-matched GaInP/Ga(In) As/Ge triple-junction <b>solar</b> <b>cells.</b> Specifically, we have detected a quantum efficiency loss in the wavelength region corresponding to the emitter layer (which accounts for up to 20 % loss in equivalent JSC) and up to 55  mV loss in VOC of the Ge subcell as compared with analogous devices grown as single-junction Ge <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> on the same type of substrates. We prove experimentally that there is no direct correlation between the loss in VOC and the doping level of the base. Our simulations show that both the JSC and VOC losses are consistent with a degradation of the minority carrier properties at the emitter, in particular at the initial nanometers of the emitter next to the emitter/window heterointerface. In addition, we also rule out the gradual emitter profile shape as the origin of the degradation observed. Our findings underscore the potential to obtain higher efficiencies in Ge-based multijunction <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> if strategies to mitigate the impact of the thermal load are taken into consideration...|$|R

One of the first issues {{to be considered in}} the development of this structure will be the strategy to create the silicon emitter of the bottom subcell. In this study, we explore the possibility of forming the silicon emitter by phosphorus diffusion (i. e. exposing the wafer to PH 3 in a MOVPE reactor) and still obtain good surface morphologies to achieve a successful III-V heteroepitaxy as occurs in conventional III-V on <b>germanium</b> <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> technology. Consequently, we explore the parameter space (PH 3 partial pressure, time and temperature) that is needed to create optimized emitter designs and assess the impact of such treatments on surface morphology using atomic force microscopy.

40|$|Restricting {{the angular}} range {{in which a}} {{photovoltaic}} system emits light, is a promising but rather unexplored approach to enhance conversion efficiency. In this paper we analyze and discuss {{the effect of a}} directionally selective filter on the absorption of light and the generation of charge carriers in a <b>germanium</b> <b>solar</b> <b>cell.</b> A directionally selective filter transmits photons of perpendicular incidence and reflects photons under oblique incidence in a given spectral range. To investigate its effect on light trapping, we perform reflection and quantum efficiency measurements. The reflection measurements show that a wavelength dependent absorption enhancement is induced by the application of the directionally selective filter. We calculate a maximum absorption enhancement of 45 % at lambda approximate to 1900 nm. We show that the absorption enhancement is caused by light trapping of non-absorbed and scattered light and is not due to a suppression of radiative processes. A trapping of photons generated by radiative recombination could not be detected. Measurements of the quantum efficiency confirm the results of the reflection measurements. The generation of charge carriers is increased by up to 33 % at lambda approximate to 1900 nm. A comparison of path length enhancement factors calculated from reflection and quantum efficiency measurements indicates a low parasitic absorption in the solar cell device...|$|E

Recently, {{it has been shown that}} this instability is correlated with the presence of multiple bonded Si-H bonds (i. e., SiH 2), and a technique, namely chemical annealing, was suggested to improve the quality and the stability of a-SiGe:H. Although a number of results have been reported to produce good a-SiGe:H films but, no chemical annealed devices with good quality were reported and no systemic study was ever done on it.. In this work, chemical annealed a-SiGe:H films and devices, and non chemical annealed films and devices were produced in very high frequency plasma enhanced CVD, and systematic experiments were carried out to study the role of chemical annealing in enhancing the quality of a-SiGe:H <b>solar</b> <b>cells.</b> It is found that the materials were grown using a layer-by-layer approach, where the growth of a thin film was followed by a chemical anneal in hydrogen or helium plasma. Multiple cycles were used to build up the total film thickness.

FTIR measurements showed that the films which were prepared using chemical annealing had fewer SiH 2 and GeH 2 bonds. Electrical measurements showed that the films subjected to chemical anneal had a higher photo/dark conductivity ratio, a smaller Urbach energy and higher electron mobility-lifetime products. p-i-n and n-i-n devices were prepared on stainless steel substrates.

Additionally, the infrared excitation spectra of the 1800 nm luminescence, {{as well as the}} visible excitation spectra of the 522 nm and 652 nm luminescence, of (A) Er 3 +(8 %) Tm 3 +(0. 5 %) : telluride glass are very similar to those of Er 3 + ions in (C) Er 3 +(0. 5 %) : telluride glass, with respect to the shapes of their excitation spectral waveforms and peak wavelengths. Moreover, we found that there is a strong spectral overlap and energy transfer between the infrared luminescence of Er 3 + donor ions and the infrared absorption of Tm 3 + acceptor ions.

The aim of this thesis was {{to design and fabricate}} a highly efficient silicon <b>germanium</b> (SiGe) <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> grown on a Si substrate. The performance of the SiGe on Si <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> is evaluated based on the AM 1. 5 G solar spectrum with wavelengths above 750 nm only. This is because the designed SiGe on Si <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> will eventually work under a gallium-arsenide-phosphide (GaAsP) top cell in a GaAs 0. 84 P 0. 16 /SiGe on Si tandem device. This research first determined the optical properties of SiGe films and graded buffer layers. The optical constants of SiGe films grown on Si substrates with germanium (Ge) compositions of 77 %, 82 %, 85 % and 88 % from wavelengths of 400 nm to 1450 nm at room temperature were determined. Average absorption coefficients of SiGe graded buffer layers from 0 % to 77 %, 82 %, 85 % and 88 % Ge at wavelengths beyond the band gap of Si were also determined. Following material characterization, the performance of SiGe on Si <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> was predicted based on first principles. Then, a SiGe on Si <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> was fabricated. Characterization and analysis were carried out on the first fabricated SiGe <b>solar</b> <b>cell.</b> Several possible pathways to improve the <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> performance were proposed based on the analysis results. After this first demonstration, more SiGe on Si <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> were fabricated to demonstrate different ideas for performance improvement. The short-circuit current density (Jsc) was improved by optimizing the thicknesses and doping densities of emitter and base, light trapping design, anti-reflection coating (ARC), Si substrate thinning and higher Ge compositions. The open-circuit voltage (Voc) was improved by adding a back surface field (BSF) layer, back surface passivation and hydrogen defect passivation. These improvements lead to the highest measured Jsc of 20. 3 mA/cm 2 and the highest measured Voc of 354 mV on different SiGe on Si <b>solar</b> <b>cells.</b> The best measured efficiency is 3. 4 % with a Voc of 348 mV, Jsc of 15. 1 mA/cm 2 and fill factor (FF) of 0. 65.

The EOS TERRA spacecraft's launch provided a major contribution to the NASA Mission to Planet Earth program while incorporating many {{state of the art}} electrical power system technologies to achieve its mission goals. The EOS TERRA spacecraft was designed around five state-of-the-art scientific instrument packages designed to monitor key parameters associated with the earth's climate. The development focus of the TERRA electrical power system (EPS) resulted from a need for high power distribution to the EOS TERRA spacecraft subsystems and instruments and minimizing mass and parasitic losses. Also important as a design goal of the EPS was maintaining tight regulation on voltage and achieving low conducted bus noise characteristics. This paper outlines the major requirements for the EPS as well as the resulting hardware implementation approach adopted {{to meet the demands of}} the EOS TERRA low earth orbit mission. The selected orbit, based on scientific needs, to achieve the EOS TERRA mission goals is a sun-synchronous circular 98. 2 degree inclination Low Earth Orbit (LEO) with a near circular average altitude of 705 kilometers. The nominal spacecraft orbit is approximately 99 minutes with an average eclipse period of about 34 minutes. The scientific goal of the selected orbit is to maintain a repeated 10 : 30 a. m. +/- 15 minute descending equatorial crossing which provides a fairly clear view of the earth's surface and relatively low cloud interference for the instrument observation measurements. The major EOS TERRA EPS design requirements are single fault tolerant, average orbit power delivery of 2, 530 watts with a defined minimum lifetime of five years (EOL). To meet these mission requirements, while minimizing mass and parasitic power losses, the EOS TERRA project relies on 36, 096 high efficiency Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) on <b>Germanium</b> <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> adhered to a deployable flexible solar array designed to provide over 5, 000 watts of power at EOL.

Three groups of <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> are fabricated. Performance of Si:Ge <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> in this structure improve significantly due to better Si:Ge epitaxial layers growth conditions. The Si:Ge <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> achieved with a Jsc of 3. 26 mA/cm 2, Voc of 189 mV below the silicon filter under one sun without light trapping. Silicon <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> in this structure have fine performances, the best one which has a POCl 3 diffused emitter has a Jsc 22. 9 mA/cm 2, Voc 598. 5 mV and FF 77. 3 %. This work demonstrates that three terminal Si-Si:Ge monolithic tandem <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> can achieve higher potential efficiency than standalone transparent silicon <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> and Si:Ge <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> and avoid current mismatching which exists in two terminal multi-junction <b>solar</b> <b>cells.</b> University of Delaware, Department of Electrical and Computer EngineeringM.
