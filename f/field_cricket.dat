50|$|<b>Field</b> <b>crickets</b> eat a {{broad range}} of feeds: seeds, plants, or insects (dead or alive). They are known to feed on {{grasshopper}} eggs, pupae of Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) and Diptera (flies). Occasionally they may rob spiders of their prey. <b>Field</b> <b>crickets</b> also eat grass.|$|R
50|$|The {{chirping}} of {{the more}} common <b>field</b> <b>crickets</b> is not as reliably correlated to temperature—their chirping rate varies depending on other factors such as age and mating success.

25|$|The {{earliest}} known {{instances of}} ground enclosure occurred in 1731, the playing area on Kennington Common being roped off twice {{in an attempt}} to keep spectators off the <b>field.</b> <b>Cricket</b> is the first sport known to have enclosed its venues and it quickly became common practice with stakes and ropes being reported at the Artillery Ground in 1732. It is not clear when admission fees were first introduced but there was certainly a two pence charge in place at the Artillery Ground by the early 1740s.|$|E
25|$|A common {{example of}} {{polyandrous}} mating {{can be found}} in the <b>field</b> <b>cricket</b> (Gryllus bimaculatus) of the invertebrate order Orthoptera (containing crickets, grasshoppers, and groundhoppers). Polyandrous behavior is also prominent in many other insect species, including the red flour beetle and the species of spider Stegodyphus lineatus. Polyandry also occurs in some primates such as marmosets, mammal groups, the marsupial genus' Antechinus and bandicoots, around 1% of all bird species, such as jacanas and dunnocks, insects such as honeybees, and fish such as pipefish.|$|E
25|$|The Kobe Regatta & Athletic Club (KRAC) was {{a sports}} club founded on September 23, 1870, by the {{proposal}} of Alexander Cameron Sim. KRAC {{was able to}} secure land {{on the eastern side}} of the foreign settlement immediately, and by December 1870, just three months after its founding, had completed a boathouse and gymnasium, and a pool by June 1871, launching its activities at a favorable pace. KRAC members competed in a wide variety of sports including regatta, track and field, rugby, tennis, swimming, water polo, and rifle shooting. In 1871, KRAC competed at the Yokohama foreign settlement against the Yokohama Boat Club and the Nippon Rowing Club in a regatta event. After this, the sports clubs of Kobe and Yokohama periodically competed at events including regatta, track and <b>field,</b> <b>cricket,</b> and football. These matches continued even after the return of the settlement, with the exception of a period during the Second World War.|$|E

2500|$|The {{life cycle}} of a cricket usually spans {{no more than three}} months. The larvae of the <b>field</b> <b>cricket</b> hatch from eggs in 7–8 days, while those of Acheta domesticus develop in 11–12 days. Development of the larvae in a controlled, warm (...) farm {{environment}} takes four to five weeks for all cultivated species. After the fourth or fifth larval instar the wingless larvae moult into the winged imago which lives for around one month. Crickets are omnivorous, opportunistic scavengers. They feed on decaying vegetable matter and fruit, and attack weaker insects or their larvae.|$|E

6000|$|Nothing {{could have}} suited Alan Merrick better, {{and he said}} so at once. Herminia {{disappeared}} {{for a moment to}} get her hat. Alan observed almost without observing it that she was gone but for a second. She asked none of that long interval that most women require for the simplest matter of toilet. She was back again almost instantly, bright and fresh and smiling, in the most modest of hats, set so artlessly on her head that it became her better than all art could have made it. Then they started for a long stroll across the breezy common, yellow in places with upright spikes of small summer furze, and pink with wild pea-blossom. Bees buzzed, broom crackled, the chirp of the <b>field</b> <b>cricket</b> rang shrill from the sand-banks. Herminia's light foot tripped over the spongy turf. By the top of the furthest ridge, looking down on North Holmwood church, they sat side by side for a while on the close short grass, brocaded with daisies, and gazed across at the cropped sward of Denbies and the long line of the North Downs stretching away towards Reigate. Tender grays and greens melted into one another on the larches hard by; Betchworth chalk-pit gleamed dreamy white in the middle distance. They had been talking earnestly all the way, like two old friends together; for they were both of them young, and they felt at once that nameless bond which often draws one closer to a new acquaintance at first sight than years of converse. [...] "How seriously you look at life," [...] Alan cried at last, in answer to one of Herminias graver thoughts. [...] "I wonder what makes you take it so much more earnestly than all other women?" ...|$|E
