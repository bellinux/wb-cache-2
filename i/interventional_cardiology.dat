2500|$|The {{field of}} <b>interventional</b> <b>cardiology</b> {{has had a}} number of controversies since its inception. [...] In part this is because of the dawning of the {{randomized}} control trial as the marker of a successful procedure. [...] This is worsened by the rapid changes in the field of <b>interventional</b> <b>cardiology.</b> [...] Procedures would be used soon after they are described in the literature or at conferences, with trial data determining if the procedure improves outcomes lagging behind by years due to the strict protocols and long follow-up of patients necessary to test the procedure. [...] By the time the trials were published, they would be considered out of date, as they did not reflect the current practice in the field. [...] This led to the inception and use of a number of procedures and devices in the interventional realm that have fallen out of practice due to their being found to not improve outcomes after formal trials have been performed.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{significantly}} lower restenosis rates of drug eluting stents compared to bare metal stents, the <b>interventional</b> <b>cardiology</b> community began using these stents {{as soon as}} they became available. [...] Cordis, the manufacturer of the Cypher drug eluting stent, was not able {{to keep up with the}} demand for these stents when they first entered the market. [...] This fueled a rationing of Cypher stents; they were used on difficult anatomy and high risk individuals. [...] At the time there was a fear by the general population that these drug eluting stents would not be used on individuals who could not afford them (as they cost significantly more than the bare metal stents of the era).|$|E
2500|$|Another {{source of}} {{controversy}} {{in the field of}} <b>interventional</b> <b>cardiology</b> is the overlapping roles of PCI and coronary artery bypass surgery for individuals with coronary artery disease. [...] This area has been studied in a number of trials since the early 1990s. [...] Unfortunately, due to the rapid changes in technique in both bypass surgery as well as PCI, added to the better understanding of the role of intense pharmacologic therapy in individuals with coronary artery disease, questions still remain on the best form of therapy in many subgroups of patients. [...] Multiple ongoing studies hope to tease out which individuals do better with PCI and which do better with CABG, but in general each case is individualized to the patient and the relative comfort level of the interventional cardiologist and the cardiothoracic surgeon.|$|E

2500|$|When {{the results}} of the first trials of {{drug-eluting}} stents were published, there was a general feeling in the <b>interventional</b> <b>cardiology</b> community that these devices would be part of the perfect revascularization regimen for coronary artery disease. [...] With the very low restenosis rates of the RAVEL and SIRIUS trials, interventions were performed on more complex blockages in the coronary arteries, under the assumption that the results in real life would mimic the results in the trials. [...] The antiplatelet regimens that were advised for the drug eluting stents were based on the early trials of these stents. [...] Based on these trials, the antiplatelet regimen was a combination of aspirin and clopidogrel for 3 months when Cypher stents were used, and 9 months when Taxus stents were used, followed by aspirin indefinitely.|$|E

40|$|The {{work package}} 3 of the ORAMED project, Collaborative Project (2008 - 11) {{supported}} by the European Commission within its seventh Framework Programme, {{is focused on the}} optimisation of the use of active personal dosemeters (APDs) in <b>interventional</b> radiology and <b>cardiology</b> (IR/IC). Indeed, a lack of appropriate APD devices is identified for these specific fields. Few devices can detect low-energy X rays (20 - 100 keV), and none of them are specifically designed for working in pulsed radiation fields. The work presented in this paper consists in studying the behaviour of some selected APDs deemed suitable for application in IR/IC. For this purpose, measurements under laboratory conditions, both with continuous and pulsed X-ray beams, and tests in real conditions on site in different European hospitals were performed.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{incidence and}} {{risk factors of}} adverse events associated with pediatric cardiac catheterization in the initial experience of our institution. Patients and methods: The retrospective cohort study was conducted on 262 children with congenital heart disease who received cardiac catheterization in our catheterization between April 2010 and April 2013. Diagnostic CC was performed in 176 patients and therapeutic CC in 86 patients. All children‚Äôs electronic and paper chart records were reviewed to obtain demographic, procedural, and treatment data. The severities of AE were further classified into minor, moderate and higher severity AE including levels 3, 4 or 5 AE. Results: Of 262 patients (147 females, 55. 4 %), AE occurred in 31 studies (11. 8 %), in children {{ranging in age from}} 3 ¬†days to 16 ¬†years. There were 7 patients with higher severity AE (2. 7 %), 7 patients with moderate AE (2. 7 %) and 17 patients (6. 5 %) with minor AE. Vascular complications represented the majority (n¬†=¬† 12; 38. 7 %). Two children died within 24 ¬†h (0. 7 % of total case numbers). The risk factors for a complication included patient low body weight and the second year of our institution experience. Conclusions: Pediatric cardiac catheterization by well trained team of pediatric cardiologists in a new center is effective. The rate of occurrence of AEs approximated to those which are reported by various <b>interventional</b> pediatric <b>cardiology</b> centers around the world.

40|$|Active {{personal}} dosemeters (APD) {{have been}} found to be very efficient tools to reduce occupational doses in many applications of ionizing radiation. In order to be used in <b>interventional</b> radiology and <b>cardiology</b> (IR/IC), APDs should be able to measure low energy photons and pulsed radiation with relatively high instantaneous personal dose equivalent rates. A study concerning the optimization of the use of APDs in IR/IC was performed in the framework of the ORAMED project, a Collaborative Project (2008 - 2011) supported by the European Commission within its 7 th Framework Program. In particular, eight commercial APDs were tested in continuous and pulsed X-ray fields delivered by calibration laboratories in order to evaluate their performances. Most of APDs provide a response in pulsed mode more or less affected by the personal dose equivalent rate, which means they could be used in routine monitoring provided that correction factors are introduced. These results emphasize the importance of adding tests in pulsed mode in type-test procedures for APDs. Some general recommendations are proposed in the end of this paper for the selection and use of APDs at IR/IC workplaces...|$|R

40|$|There {{have been}} many changes in {{healthcare}} provision in recent years, including the delivery of some surgical services in primary care or in day surgery centres, which were previously provided by acute hospitals. Developments {{in the fields of}} <b>interventional</b> radiology and <b>cardiology</b> have further expanded the range and complexity of procedures undertaken in these settings. In the face of these changes {{there is a need to}} define from an infection prevention and control perspective the basic physical requirements for facilities in which such surgical procedures may be carried out. Under the auspices of the Healthcare Infection Society, we have developed the following recommendations for those designing new facilities or upgrading existing facilities. These draw upon best practice, available evidence, other guidelines where appropriate, and expert consensus to provide sensible and feasible advice. An attempt is also made to define minimal access interventions and minor surgical procedures. For minimal access interventions, including interventional radiology, new facilities should be mechanically ventilated to achieve 15 air changes per hour but natural ventilation is satisfactory for minor procedures. All procedures should involve a checklist and operators should be appropriately trained. There is also a need for prospective surveillance to accurately determine the post-procedure infection rate.

40|$|The {{equivalent}} dose limit for the eye lens for occupational exposure {{recommended by the}} ICRP {{has been reduced to}} 20 mSv y- 1 averaged over defined periods of 5 y, with no single year exceeding 50 mSv. The compliance with this new requirement could not be easy in some workplace such as <b>interventional</b> radiology and <b>cardiology.</b> The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate different possible approaches in order to have a good estimate of the eye lens dose during interventional procedures. Measurements were performed with an X-ray system Philips Allura FD- 10, using a PMMA phantom to simulate the patient scattered radiation and a Rando phantom to simulate the cardiologist. Thermoluminescence (TL) whole-body and TL eye lens dosemeters together with Philips DoseAware active dosemeters were located on different positions of the Rando phantom to estimate the eye lens dose in typical cardiology procedures. The results show that, for the studied conditions, any of the analysed dosemeter positions are suitable for eye lens dose assessment. However, the centre of the thyroid collar and the left ear position provide a better estimate. Furthermore, in practice, improper use of the ceiling-suspended screen can produce partial protection of some parts of the body, and thus large differences between the measured doses and the actual exposure of the eye could arise if the dosemeter is not situated close to the eye.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundEarly reperfusion {{therapy has}} proven benefit in {{reducing}} mortality {{in patients with}} ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Expert guideline committees have defined recommendations to improve the management of patients with STEMI and decrease their mortality rates. AimsTo identify predictors of compliance with American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for reperfusion therapy in STEMI and to determine the prognostic impact of compliance. MethodsESTIM Midi-Pyr√©n√©es was a multidisciplinary, prospective registry in patients with STEMI, conducted between June 2001 and June 2003 in French hospitals. Data were analysed from 1277 patients managed by emergency physicians in the prehospital system or emergency room and/or cardiologists in <b>interventional</b> or non-interventional <b>cardiology</b> departments. ResultsA revascularization strategy was performed in 89. 4 % of patients; treatment complied with the guidelines in 61. 1 % of patients. After multivariable analysis, factors associated with compliance were age less or equal than 75 years (odds ratio [OR] 1. 56, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 18 ‚Äì 2. 08), symptom onset during the day (OR 1. 43, 95 % CI 1. 12 ‚Äì 1. 82), typical electrocardiographic symptoms of STEMI (OR 3. 2, 95 % CI 2. 19 ‚Äì 4. 5), and initial medical contact. After adjustment for confounders, 1 -month mortality was significantly lower in patients managed according to guideline recommendations (OR 0. 60, 95 % CI 0. 40 ‚Äì 0. 92).
