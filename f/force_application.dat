25|$|Considering the biomechanical {{force system}} {{generated}} by a cantilever, {{it is important to}} remember that a combination of a moment and a force is produced at the unit into which the cantilever is inserted, whereas only a single force is developed with respect to the point of <b>force</b> <b>application</b> of the other end. The magnitude of the two forces is equal and opposite, according to the third law of Newton, and the activation can be measured by a dynamometer.|$|E

In Combe v Combe [...] 2 KB 215, CA a husband promised to make maintenance payments to his separated wife but failed to do so. The wife brought an action to enforce the promise invoking promissory estoppel. The court held that promissory estoppel does not create a cause of action and as such the requirement of consideration in formation of contract is still relevant. Promissory estoppel is a rule of evidence that prevents the promisor from denying the truth of statement which the promisee had relied. Denning LJ said: [...] "The principle does not create new causes of action where none existed before. It only prevents a party from insisting on his strict legal rights when it would be unjust to allow him to enforce them". However, this requirement seemed changed in light of the decisions in Evenden v Guildford City AFC [...] QB 917, here the courts held [...] "that promissory estoppel can be a cause of action." ...|$|E

OBJECTIVES: To compare lower extremity <b>force</b> <b>applications</b> during a sit-to-stand (STS) task {{with and without}} upper extremity assistance in older individuals post–hip fracture to those of age matched controls. BACKGROUND: A recent study documented the dependence on upper extremity assistance and the uninvolved lower limb during an STS task in individuals post–hip fracture. This study extends this work by examining the effect of upper extremity assistance on symmetry of lower extremity <b>force</b> <b>applications.</b> METHODS: Twenty-eight community-dwelling elderly subjects, 14 who had recovered from a hip fracture and 14 controls, participated in the study. All participants were independent ambulators. Four force plates {{were used to determine}} lower extremity <b>force</b> <b>applications</b> during an STS task with and without upper extremity assistance. The summed vertical ground reaction forces (vGRFs) of both limbs were used to determine STS phases (preparation/rising). The lower extremity <b>force</b> <b>applications</b> were assessed statistically using analysis of variance models. RESULTS: During the preparation phase, sideto-side symmetry of the rate of force development was significantly lower for the hip fracture group for both STS tasks (P 3 ̆c. 001). During the rising phase, the vGRF impulse of the involved limb was significantly lower for the hip fracture group for both STS tasks (P =. 045). The vGRF impulse for the uninvolved limb was significantly increased when participants with hip fracture did not use upper extremity assistance compared to elderly controls (P =. 002). This resulted in a significantly lower vGRF symmetry for the hip fracture group during both STS tasks (P 3 ̆c. 001). CONCLUSION: Participants with hip fracture who were discharged from rehabilitative care demonstrated decreased side-to-side symmetry of lower extremity loading during an STS task, irrespective of whether upper extremity assistance was provided. These findings suggest that learned motor control strategies may influence movement patterns post–hip fracture...|$|R
