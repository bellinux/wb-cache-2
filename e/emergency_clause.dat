40|$|The Great Recession has {{prompted}} unparalleled economic {{research on the}} causes and handling of crises. It is then important for international investment law {{to catch up with}} the new conceptual developments. This article is an attempt in this direction. Its first part presents a description of one of the main tools to avoid economic collapses— early warning models (EWMs) —which have received increasing attention by the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the Fed. This part also presents the debate among economists about the meaningfulness of EWMs. The second part shows how international investment law should respond to this debate and proceed with an assessment of the role that EWMs may have in the interpretation of <b>emergency</b> <b>clauses</b> in BITs and the customary rule of necessity. In particular, this part deals with the question of what happens in international legal terms when a State, which relies on EWMs to adopt measures aimed at preventing a crisis, adversely affects foreign investors. The section also discusses the level of deference that investor/State tribunals may accord to States relying on EWMs when taking economic preventive action and illustrates how international arbitration tribunals should deal with debates on the quality of the given EWMs...|$|R
40|$|International {{trade and}} {{investment}} arbitration are distinct disciplines {{within the field of}} international economic law. Practitioners and scholars in one field rarely labor in the vineyards of the other. Yet the {{trade and investment}} regimes routinely overlap and are increasingly converging. The different regimes are often embedded in the same treaties, with one section of a treaty addressing investment protections and other sections addressing trade promotion. The different regimes incorporate similar substantive protections—particularly rules against discrimination—as well as similar exceptions from those rules, such as <b>emergency</b> <b>clauses.</b> They promote similar objectives—globalization, economic integration, trade promotion, and investment protection—over other government objectives, such as environmental protection, labor rights, or health and human safety. Both regimes provide for baseline protections—one in a multilateral treaty, the other as part of customary international law—but assume a patchwork of bilateral or regional arrangements that afford closer integration among allies. Both regimes use international tribunals as the vehicle for dispute settlement, allowing for judicial review of sovereign state violations of international law. These tribunals often cite to one another, creating an emerging international economic law jurisprudence. Both regimes use the economic leverage of tariff benefits to secure compliance with adverse judicial decisions. Both regimes are on the ascendance, with countries clamoring to reap the rewards of membership in each club. There are, of course, numerous differences between the two regimes worthy of examination. But for purposes of this paper I wish to focus on the overlap and convergence between the trade and investment regimes, and the implications of such a development for each regime and for international law generally...|$|R

40|$|Astoundingly, the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights (ACHPR) {{does not}} contain [a] {{derogation}} clause. Furthermore, it has been established by the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights (the Commission) {{in the case of}} Commission Nationale des Droits de l'Homme et des Libertes v Chad (Commission Nationale case) that a member state of teh ACHPR cannot derogate human rights in case of emergencies. Hence, the Commission's view may lead to a conclusion that all rights under the ACHPR are non-derogable. This raises the issue of whether it is tenable to conclude that a state facing a situation that endangers the nation, should not at all derogate from the provisions of the ACHPR. <b>Emergency</b> <b>clauses,</b> which permit derogation of human rights in times of emergencies, are also found in most domestic legal instruments. Most African states also encompass this clause in their constitutions. Although the levels of compliance by states are questionable, some of these constitutions also include a list of non-derogable rights. The constitutions of Ethiopia and Mozambique also provide for a derogation clause and a list of non-derogable rights. The aim of the study is to make a critical analysis of the African derogation system. Firstly, the study will analyse the concept of derogation and non-derogable rights in general. Secondly, the jurisprudence and the law of the African system with regard to derogation and non-derogable rights will be examined. In analysing the jurisprudence of the Commission effort will be made to critically study the cases that have been examined by the Commission in relation to derogation and non-derogable rights. Lastly, the compatibility of the Ethiopian and Mozambique constitutions in light of the African system and international standards will be discussed. [...] . Chapter one highlights the basis and structure of the entire study. Chapter two presents a brief historical evolution as well as conceptual framework of the system of derogation and non-derogable human rights in state of emergency. Chapter three focuses on the ACHPR and the jurisprudence of the Commission with regard to derogation and non-derogable rights in state of emergency. Chapter four assesses the compatibility of the non-derogable rights provided in the constitutions of African states with African and international standards. This chapter will [analyse], in particular, the constitutions and the practices of Ethiopia and Mozambique. Chapter five is a conclusion of the overall study stating specific recommendations.

5000|$|Before the war, Greenland was {{a tightly}} {{controlled}} colony of Denmark, otherwise closed {{off to the}} world. After the Invasion of Denmark on 9 April 1940, Greenland was left on its own, because the Royal Navy seized any ships arriving from Axis-controlled Europe. Britain and Canada initially laid plans to occupy points of interest on the island, but the United States, still neutral, firmly rejected [...] "third party" [...] intervention there. The sheriffs ("landsfogeder") of South and North Greenland, Eske Brun and Aksel Svane, invoking the <b>emergency</b> <b>clause</b> of a 1925 law specifying how Greenland was ruled, declared Greenland a self-ruling territory, believing this {{to be in the}} best interests of the colony as Denmark was occupied by Germany. This step was taken in coordination with the Danish envoy to Washington D.C., Henrik de Kauffmann, and the U.S. State Department, and comported with the U.S. declaration of 1920 that no third nation would necessarily be accepted as a sovereign in Greenland. This diplomatic stance was seen as an extension of the Monroe Doctrine.|$|E

Indiana banned synthetic cannabinoids in a law which became effective in March 2012. North Carolina banned synthetic cannabis mimics by a unanimous vote of the state senate, due to concerns that its contents and effects are reasonably similar to cannabis, and may cause equal effects in terms of psychological dependency.|$|E

40|$|Theoretical {{literature}} {{on the politics of}} land use is so limited that original research into the problem was required. The drafting and enactment of Senate Bill 100 by the Fifty-seventh Session of the Oregon Legislature provided the basis for researching my premise of need equals want. The bill designated state land use planning organizational structure. The Land Use Policy Committee minutes and Legislative minutes were merged with information attained through personal interviews from a variety of participants in the drafting of the Senate Bill 100. Theoretical literature was equally available in Public Administration, Law and Land Use Planning. The Constitutions of the United States and the State of Oregon plus the Oregon Revised Statutes were fundamental in the research. The research material on the politics of land use was found by sifting through public and private records and four separate libraries: Oregon State Archives, the Oregon State Law Library, Multnomah County Law Library and Portland State University Library. Personal interviews provided valuable additional data. The politics of land use is the lengthy saga of the enactment of Senate Bill 100 (1973) by the Oregon Legislature. It {{is the story of the}} bill’s conception, conflicts and compromises. The Land Use Policy Committee (LUPC), Created and chaired by State Senator Hector Macpherson, drafted the original SB 100 in 1972, which was assigned to the Oregon Senate Environment and Land Use Committee (SELUC) in January, 1973. The LUPC bill was designed of, by and for proponents of land use planning. When the opponents to the planning concept were heard by the SELUC, need vs. want made passage of Senate Bill 100 a political impossibility. The issues that surfaced generated a series of conflicts which required political compromises. In addition to the primary conflict, need vs. want, there were provocations concerning localism vs. regionalism; economy vs. environment and who holds what reins of power. The Drafting Subcommittee of the Ad Hoc Committee of the SELUC made six significant changed in SB 100 to insure legislative enactment of the bill in 1973. The changes, while resolving most of the conflicts, still did not equate need and want, so the SELUC added a Statement of Legislative Intent, not to SB 100, but to the Senate Journal as a limit on administrative power. The last political compromise was made during the Senate Floor Debate on SB 100 when the <b>emergency</b> <b>clause</b> was removed from the bill. To all intents and purposed, need equaled want with Senate passage...|$|E
