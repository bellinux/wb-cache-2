500|$|Niffenegger is {{an artist}} {{who teaches at the}} Center for Book and Paper Arts at Columbia College Chicago, where she prepares editions of handpainted books. She {{produced}} some of her earlier works in editions of ten copies, which were sold in art galleries. However, she decided that The Time Traveler's Wife {{would have to be a}} novel: [...] "I got the idea for the title, and when <b>I</b> <b>draw</b> I have this big drawing table covered with brown paper, and I write ideas down on the paper. So I wrote down this title and after a while I started to think about it. I couldn't think of a way to make it a picture book because still pictures don't represent time very well, so I decided to write a novel." [...] She was intrigued by the title because [...] "it immediately defined two people and their relationship to each other". Niffenegger said that its source was an epigraph to J. B. Priestley's 1964 novel Man and Time: [...] "Clock time is our bank manager, tax collector, police inspector; this inner time is our wife." [...] Drawing her central theme from this image, she says, [...] "Henry is not only married to Clare; he's also married to time." [...] Other authors whom Niffenegger has cited as influencing the book include Richard Powers, David Foster Wallace, Henry James, and Dorothy Sayers.|$|E

[...] "Revolt" [...] here refers to the refusal of suicide and search for meaning despite the revelation of the Absurd; [...] "Freedom" [...] refers {{to the lack of}} imprisonment by religious devotion or others' moral codes; [...] "Passion" [...] refers to the most wholehearted experiencing of life, since hope has been rejected, and so he concludes that every moment must be lived fully.|$|E

2500|$|Regarding a citizen’s {{obedience}} to authority, Socrates {{says that a}} lawful authority, either human or divine, should always be obeyed.

That, as spokesman for the Oracle at Delphi, he is to spur the Athenians to greater awareness of ethics and moral conduct, and always shall question and argue, even if his accusers — Lycon, Anytus, and Meletus — withdraw their accusations against him. Therefore, the philosopher Socrates of Athens asks his fellow citizens: [...] "Are you not ashamed that you give your attention to acquiring {{as much money as}} possible, and similarly with reputation and honour, and give no attention or thought to truth and understanding, and the perfection of your soul?" ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, however, the English {{see her as}} a demon. Prior to her combat with Talbot, he exclaims, [...] "Devil or devil's dam, I'll conjure thee./Blood will <b>I</b> <b>draw</b> on thee – thou art a witch –/And {{straightway}} give thy soul to him thou serv'st" [...] (1.6.5–7). Then, after the fight, he says, [...] "My thoughts are whirl'd like a potter's wheel./I know not where I am nor what I do./A witch, by fear, not force, like Hannibal,/Drives back our troops and conquers as she lists" [...] (1.6.19–22). Upon arriving in France, Bedford condemns Charles for aligning himself with Joan: [...] "How much he wrongs his fame,/Despairing of his own arms' fortitude,/To join with witches and the help of hell" [...] (2.1.16–18). Talbot responds to this with, [...] "Well, let them practice and converse with spirits./God is our fortress" [...] (2.1.25–26). Later, Talbot refers to her as [...] "Pucelle, that witch, that damn'd sorceress" [...] (3.2.37) and [...] "Foul fiend of France, and hag of all despite" [...] (3.2.51), declaring [...] "I speak not to that railing Hecate" [...] (3.2.64). Prior to executing her, York also calls her a [...] "Fell banning hag" [...] (5.2.42).|$|E
2500|$|When {{we try to}} be definite, as to what we {{mean when}} we say that this or that is [...] "the Good," [...] we find {{ourselves}} involved in very great difficulties. Bentham's creed, that pleasure is the Good, roused furious opposition, and was said to be a pig's philosophy. Neither he nor his opponents could advance any argument. In a scientific question, evidence can be adduced on both sides, and, in the end, one side is seen to have the better case — or, if this does not happen, the question is left undecided. But in a question, as to whether this, or that, is the ultimate Good, there is no evidence, either way; each disputant can only appeal to his own emotions, and employ such rhetorical devices as shall rouse similar emotions in others ... Questions as to [...] "values" [...] — that is to say, as to what is good or bad on its own account, independently of its effects — lie outside the domain of science, as the defenders of religion emphatically assert. I think that, in this, they are right, but, <b>I</b> <b>draw</b> the further conclusion, which they do not draw, that questions as to [...] "values" [...] lie wholly outside the domain of knowledge. That is to say, when we assert that this, or that, has [...] "value", we are giving expression to our own emotions, not to a fact, which would still be true if our personal feelings were different.|$|E
2500|$|Two years later, Einstein {{released}} the album Mazal Gdi (Capricorn), {{which was not}} very successful. He therefore looked for a new sound {{and went on to}} produce the album Puzi with the Churchills, considered the first Israeli rock album. He stopped performing live in the early 1980s. He said: [...] "I performed from the age of 18 until I was 42...I wasn't exactly a stage animal. I was held back by the embarrassment, the bashfulness, and it became more evident as the years went by... By the way, when I say bashfulness, I'm not proud of it... I wish I could grab a microphone and sing like a Sinatra, but I don't have what it takes, and a person should adapt to his capabilities. On the other hand, in the studio, I blossom. That's my natural habitat, where I'm not bashful. The problem is that this profession has its field mines: success is accompanied by fame and a form of adoration, and I really don't get along with that. That's where <b>I</b> <b>draw</b> the line. It's pleasant to be loved, but not more." [...] For those who knew Einstein this came as no surprise. Einstein was regarded as a very humble and modest musician who focused solely on the artistic and creative aspect of the musical world and actively shied away from the lime-light, fame, and the entertainment business. This was also evident much later in his career when he preferred to collaborate with lesser known and younger musicians as the lifestyle and obsession with fame of more prominent artists did not suit his style.|$|E
