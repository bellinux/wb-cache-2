For many users, this is a breach of privacy, but there are no laws that prevent these companies from using the information provided on their websites. Companies like Equifax, Inc., TransUnion Corp, and LexisNexis Group thrive on collecting and sharing personal information of social media users. In 2012, Facebook purchased information from 70 million households from a third party company called Datalogix. Facebook later revealed that they purchased the information in order to create a more efficient advertising service.|$|E

[...] Students develop sophisticated <b>data</b> <b>collecting</b> and lab skills by completing a literature search, formulating a research question, articulating hypotheses, collecting and analyzing data, and presenting their findings to a bona fide scientific audience (e.g., The Intel Talent Search, the New York State Science Symposium, and local and regional science fairs).|$|E

On November 15, 2007 the government of Nova Scotia passed a legislation aimed to protect Nova Scotians' personal information from being brought forward by the USA PATRIOT Act. The act was entitled “The new Personal Information International Disclosure Protection Act”. The goal of the act is to establish requirements to protect personal information from being revealed, as well as punishments for failing to do so. Justice Minister Murray Scott stated, [...] "This legislation will help ensure that Nova Scotians' personal information will be protected. The act outlines the responsibilities of public bodies, municipalities and service providers and the consequences if these responsibilities are not fulfilled." [...] In the 1980s, the Bank of Nova Scotia {{was the center of}} an early, pre-Internet data-access case that led to the disclosure of banking records.|$|E

[...] The infrared detector is cooled to –173° Celsius (–280° Fahrenheit) by a radiator plate and three cryogenic coolers. [...] While in targeted mode, the instrument gimbals {{in order to continue}} pointing at one area even though the MRO spacecraft is moving. [...] The extra time collecting data over a targeted area increases the signal to noise ratio as well as the spatial and spectral resolution of the image. [...] This scanning ability also allows the instrument to perform emission phase functions, viewing the same surface through variable amounts of atmosphere, which can be used to determine atmospheric properties. [...] The Data Processing Unit (DPU) of CRISM performs in-flight data processing including compressing the data before transmission.|$|E

The paper reviews the results achieved during the last year about the relationships among biometric <b>data</b> <b>collected</b> from wearables and relevant features described in the educational literature. In this way sleep and stress have been identified as interesting areas that could be informed from <b>data</b> <b>collected</b> in wearables and processed by applying machine learning techniques.
