25|$|There are 972 half-hour episodes, {{but during}} the series' {{original}} run in Australia, later episodes were shown in an hour-long format. The pilot episode was shown in Australia and some UK ITV regions as a 90-minute special, although subsequent screenings <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> episode split into three half-hours. The program has been broadcast internationally, and has been particularly popular in the United Kingdom and Belgium.|$|E
25|$|We <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> forcing {{can be done}} using Boolean-valued models, by {{constructing}} a Boolean algebra with ultrafilter from a poset with a generic subset. It is also possible to go back the other way: given a Boolean algebra B, we can form a poset P of all the nonzero elements of B, and a generic ultrafilter on B restricts to a generic set on P. So the techniques of forcing and Boolean-valued models are essentially equivalent.|$|E

25|$|On 21 November 2006, {{the seven}} {{participants}} formally agreed {{to fund the}} creation of a nuclear fusion reactor. The program is anticipated to last for 30 years – 10 for construction, and 20 of operation. ITER was originally expected to cost approximately €5billion, but the rising price of raw materials and changes to the initial design <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> amount almost triple to €13billion. The reactor is expected to take 10 years to build with completion scheduled for 2019. Site preparation has begun in Cadarache, France, and procurement of large components has started.|$|E
25|$|He {{attended}} Tamalpais High School in Mill Valley, California, {{until the}} age of 16. LaVey claimed he left high school to join a circus and later carnivals, first as a roustabout and cage boy in an act with the big cats, then as a musician playing the calliope. LaVey later claimed to <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> many of the same men attended both the bawdy Saturday night shows and the tent revival meetings on Sunday mornings, which reinforced his increasingly cynical view of religion. In the foreword to the German language edition of The Satanic Bible, he cites this as the impetus to defy Christian religion as he knew it. He explains why church-goers employ double moral standards. Journalist Lawrence Wright investigated LaVey's background and found no evidence LaVey ever worked in a circus either as a musician or a cage boy.|$|E
25|$|The {{logic of}} this {{concession}} points irresistibly to {{the contention that}} the Thirteenth Amendment operates only to protect the African race. This {{is evident from the}} fact that nowhere in the record does it appear that the parties charged to have been wronged by the defendants had ever been themselves slaves, or were the descendants of slaves. They took no more from the Amendment than any other citizens of the United States. But if, as we <b>have</b> <b>seen,</b> <b>that</b> denounces a condition possible for all races and all individuals, then a like wrong perpetrated by white men upon a Chinese, or by black men upon a white man, or by any men upon any man on account of his race, would come within the jurisdiction of Congress, and that protection of individual rights which, prior to the Thirteenth Amendment, was unquestionably within the jurisdiction solely of the states, would, by virtue of that Amendment, be transferred to the nation, and subject to the legislation of Congress.|$|E

25|$|The charioteer {{would have}} had to use great skill to ensure that the radius of each turn of the chariot was correct to make one of the wheels exactly stop rotating. Unless he did this correctly, the {{pointing}} doll would not have kept aiming to the south. He {{would have been able to}} adjust the direction in which it aimed by making turns that were more or less sharp. This would sometimes have given him opportunities to use the chariot dishonestly. If it was being demonstrated to spectators, for example, and was being driven around in front of them, making many turns, the charioteer, who would have known which way was south, would have been able to make the chariot appear to work extremely accurately as a compass for long periods. The spectators could have been shown the machinery, and would <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> the charioteer could not manipulate the doll. They would presumably have been impressed by the apparent accuracy of the mechanism. It is possible that this type of chariot was sometimes constructed with the prime purpose of fraudulently impressing spectators. Possibly, people who built these chariots deceived their own employers with them, which could have gained them fame and fortune provided nobody tried using the chariots for real navigation.|$|E

He added, [...] "There is nothing that we <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> points to SpongeBob as a problem". Dauman blamed the drop on [...] "some ratings systemic issues" [...] at Nielsen, citing extensive set-top-box data that [...] "does in no way reflect" [...] the Nielsen data.|$|E

500|$|The next day, Calafia duels with King Amadis, and Radiaro duels with Esplandián. With Leonorina, his betrothed, looking on, Esplandián masters Radiaro with {{a flurry}} of weapon thrusts. Calafia and Amadis trade blows until he disarms her and knocks her helmet off. Both Calafia and Radario {{surrender}} to the Christians. While being held prisoner, Calafia acknowledges the astonishing beauty of Leonorina, daughter of the Constantinople emperor and the intended bride of Esplandián, and resolves not to interfere with their union. She accepts Christianity as the one true faith, saying, [...] "I have seen the ordered order of your religion, and the great disorder of all others, I <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> {{it is clear that}} the law which you follow must be the truth, while that which we follow is lying and falsehood." [...] She marries Talanque, a large and handsome knight who fought with her outside the city gate; similarly, her sister Liota marries Maneli, Talanque's companion in arms. The women return to California with their husbands to establish a new dynasty complete with both sexes, as a Christian nation.|$|E
500|$|Hergé did {{not make}} use of speech bubbles to convey into the comic, an {{innovation}} that was yet to become widespread in Europe, and instead his captions were accompanied by captions of three to five lines long. He would begin to add simple speech bubbles into the series, stating simple comments like [...] "Eureka!", [...] "Bang!", and [...] "Hip! Hip! Hip! Hurrah!". Hergé later noted that [...] "From time to time... I risked a timid question mark, or perhaps a few stars, when, for example, a character was punched. I must <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> in L'Éatant or Les Belles Images, the illustrated papers of the time." [...] Hergé had come {{under the influence of}} other comic strips, such as those of the French author Alain Saint-Ogan, and British comic magazine The Rainbow. He was also influenced by the contemporary American comics that reporter Léon Degrelle had sent back to Belgium from Mexico, where he was stationed to report on the Cristero War. These American comics included George McManus's Bringing Up Father, George Herriman's Krazy Kat and Rudolph Dirks's Katzenjammer Kids. Totor's button nose was influenced by the illustrations in Bringing Up Father.|$|E
500|$|In his {{television}} statement, Mubarak {{said that he}} would penalise those responsible for the violence and had a clear vision on how to end the crisis, but was satisfied with what he had offered. He stated that while remaining president {{to the end of his}} term in September he would transfer his powers to the vice-president. As far as transfer of power was concerned, Mubarak said [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> it is required to delegate the powers and authorities of the president to the vice president as dictated in the constitution,". The constitutional article was used to transfer powers if the president was [...] "temporarily" [...] unable to carry out his duties and did not require his resignation. He also said he would request six constitutional amendments and that he would lift emergency laws when security in the country permitted. Mubarak said he would stay in the country and was [...] "adamant to continue to shoulder my responsibility to protect the constitution and safeguard the interests of the people... until power is handed over to those elected in September by the people in free and fair elections in which all the guarantees of transparencies will be secured." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{its peak}} years in early 2000, SpongeBob SquarePants {{received}} enormous ratings {{and number of}} viewers. By 2012, {{it was reported that}} the series' ratings were declining. The average number of viewers aged 2 to 11 watching SpongeBob at any given time dropped 29% in the first quarter from a year earlier, according to Nielsen. Wall Street Journal business writer John Jannarone suggested that the age of the series and oversaturation of the show might be contributing to the decline of the series' ratings, and might also be directly responsible for the decline in Nickelodeon's overall ratings. Media analyst Todd Juenger, directly attributes the decline in Nickelodeon's ratings to the availability of streaming video content on services like Netflix, a provider of on-demand Internet streaming media. Philippe Dauman, the president and CEO of Viacom, contradicted the notion saying he did not think [...] "the limited amount of Nick library content on Netflix [...] has had a significant impact". [...] A Nickelodeon spokesman says SpongeBob is performing consistently well and remains as the number one rated animated series in all of children's television. He added [...] "there is nothing that we <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> points to SpongeBob as a problem."

This is an instance of a general fact: in application to a set of (formulas corresponding to) traditional rules, the definition of a stable model according to Ferraris is equivalent to the original definition. The same is true, more generally, for programs with constraints and for disjunctive programs.|$|E
2500|$|... t can {{be stated}} that Debye was rightly called an opportunist {{after his arrival}} in the United States.

2500|$|Remembering his and Barger’s structure-activity {{analysis}} of 1910, Dale wrote in 1953: “Doubtless I ought to <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> nor-adrenaline {{might be the}} main transmitter – that Elliott’s theory might be right in principle and faulty only in this detail. … It is easy, of course, to be wise {{in the light of}} facts recently discovered; lacking them I failed to jump to the truth, and I can hardly claim credit for having crawled so near and then stopped short of it.” ...|$|E
