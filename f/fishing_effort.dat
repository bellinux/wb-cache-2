5|$|Although usually sedate and approachable underwater, Pacific {{angelsharks}} {{are quick}} to bite if touched, captured, or otherwise provoked, and can inflict severe lacerations. Commercial fisheries for this species exist off Baja California {{and to a lesser}} extent off California (see below); the meat is considered excellent and is sold fresh or frozen. This species is captured in limited numbers by recreational fishers using hook-and-line, spears, or even by hand, particularly off southern California. It is also taken as bycatch in shrimp trawls operating in the Gulf of California, and processed into fishmeal. The capacity of this species to withstand a focused <b>fishing</b> <b>effort</b> is limited, due to its low rates of reproduction and movement.|$|E
5|$|Harmless to humans, the smalltail shark {{is caught}} {{incidentally}} by gillnet and longline fisheries throughout its range. The meat is sold fresh, frozen, or dried and salted. In addition, the dried fins are exported {{for use in}} shark fin soup, the liver oil and cartilage are used medicinally, and the carcass is processed into fishmeal. In 2006, the IUCN assessed this species, including Pacific populations now separated as C. cerdale, as Data Deficient {{due to a lack}} of fishery data. In Trinidad, its abundance makes it the most economically important shark. Off northern Brazil, substantial numbers are caught by gillnet fisheries targeting the Serra Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus brasiliensis). In the 1980s, this species constituted roughly 43% of the shark and ray catch, but has since declined to around 17%. This apparent decline is thought to have resulted from increasing <b>fishing</b> <b>effort,</b> the large proportion of juveniles captured, and the shark's low reproductive rate. Consequently, the IUCN has assessed the smalltail shark in Brazil as Vulnerable, and noted the urgent need for conservation measures given that northern Brazil represents the center of the species' range. Although the smalltail shark was ostensibly given protection by inclusion on the 2004 Official List of Endangered Animals in Brazil, fishing remains effectively unmanaged.|$|E

5|$|Intensive {{fishing for}} the {{porbeagle}} dates back the 1930s, when Norway {{and to a}} lesser extent Denmark began operating longline vessels in the Northeast Atlantic. The Norwegian annual catch rose from 279 tons in 1926 to 3,884 tons in 1933, and peaked at around 6,000 tons in 1947, with the resumption of fishing after World War II. Soon after the stock collapsed: Norwegian annual catches declined steadily to 1,200–1,900 tons from 1953 to 1960, 160–300 tons in the early 1970s, and 10–40 tons in the late 1980s to early 1990s. Similarly, Danish annual catches fell from 1,500 tons in the early 1950s to under 100 tons in the 1990s. France and Spain began to target porbeagles in the Northeast Atlantic in the 1970s. French fishers operate mainly in the Celtic Sea and the Bay of Biscay, and saw a decline from an annual catch of over 1,000 tons in 1979 to 300–400 tons in the late 1990s. Catches by Spanish fishers were highly variable, ranging from negligible to over 4,000 tons per year, which may reflect shifts of <b>fishing</b> <b>effort</b> into historically less-exploited waters. Since 2011, all fishing for the porbeagle has been illegal in waters of the European Union and EU-registered vessels are also prohibited from fishing for the species in international waters. In 2012, similar restriction came into effect in Norway.|$|E

25|$|The {{trophic level}} of an {{organism}} is the position it occupies {{on the food}} chain. Fisheries have been systematically overfishing high trophic predatory fish. This {{can result in a}} process called fishing down the food web, whereby the mean trophic level of available marine organisms decreases and the <b>fishing</b> <b>effort</b> must shift towards lower trophic organisms, such as jellyfish. According to the fisheries scientist Daniel Pauly, if fishing down the food web continues it will in time reduce people to a diet of jellyfish sandwiches and plankton soup.|$|E
25|$|The Law on Fisheries {{requires}} that {{total allowable catch}} (TAC) levels are set for fishery stocks. It defines these levels as the “scientifically justified annual catch of aquatic biological resources of particular species in a fishing area”. However, the Law on Fisheries {{then goes on to}} state that industrial fisheries are not necessarily required to base their catch on TAC. The Law does not explain this further, but calls {{for the federal government to}} issue a special TAC setting statute. Pacific salmon is the main stock that will probably not have TAC, but will have regulated <b>fishing</b> <b>effort</b> instead.|$|E
25|$|Recruitment is {{the number}} of new young fish that enter a {{population}} in a given year. The size of fish populations can fluctuate by orders of magnitude over time, and five to 10-fold variations in abundance are usual. This variability applies across time spans ranging from a year to hundreds of years. Year to year fluctuations in the abundance of short lived forage fish can be nearly as great as the fluctuations that occur over decades or centuries. This suggests that fluctuations in reproductive and recruitment success are prime factors behind fluctuations in abundance. Annual fluctuations often seem random, and recruitment success often has a poor relationship to adult stock levels and <b>fishing</b> <b>effort.</b> This makes prediction difficult.|$|E

Since its population is stable and regularly monitored, and the fisheries that affect it are well-managed, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this species as Least Concern.|$|E
500|$|Murray cod were {{originally}} {{the most common}} large native fish in the Murray-Darling basin. Contrary to some fishery department literature, the first serious declines in Murray cod were caused by extremely severe overfishing. In {{the latter half of}} the 1800s and the early 1900s, Murray cod — very large, very long-lived fish — were caught in unimaginable numbers by both commercial and recreational fishermen. For example, one commercial fishing operation commenced on the Murray River near Echuca in 1855, targeting Murray cod over hundreds of kilometres of river, and yet within eight years, grave concerns over the sustainability of this operation, and complaints about the near-absence of Murray cod in their heavily fished grounds, were being raised in the main state newspaper, The Argus. Yet, <b>fishing</b> <b>effort</b> continued to increase in the region, so in the late 1880s and early 1890s, between 40,000 and 150,000kg of mostly Murray cod (between 7,500 and 27,000 fish, at an average weight of 5.5kg) were caught near Echuca. Similarly, in 1883, more than 147,000kg of Murray cod were sent to Melbourne from just one river town (Moama). By the 1920s Murray cod had been overfished to the point where large-scale commercial fishing operations were no longer feasible. Recreational fishermen took similarly excessive hauls during this era, using rods and reels, handlines, setlines, drum nets, gill nets, and even explosives, with hauls often either wasted or illegally sold. Perhaps this extreme overfishing and its impacts of wild Murray cod stocks is best summarised by a short article in the Register News (a South Australian newspaper) in 1929: ...|$|E

2500|$|In Central America, {{the primary}} species of squat lobster {{targeted}} by fisheries is {{a species of}} Pleuroncodes. There {{is a great deal}} of confusion over both scientific names and common names, and the exact species is often unknown. In El Salvador, the commercial catch is generally referred to as [...] "P.planipes", but is in fact P.monodon, for instance. Commercial fishing for squat lobsters in El Salvador began in the early 1980s; production increased markedly in the 2001 season, and has continued to grow, now making up 98% of the demersal resources landed in El Salvador, with annual catches peaking at 13,708t in 2005. In Costa Rica, aggregations of squat lobsters are avoided, as the fishermen fear the squat lobsters will clog their nets. In Nicaragua, squat lobsters are heavily exploited, especially following a large increase in <b>fishing</b> <b>effort</b> in the 2007 season. In Panama, production reached 492t in 2008. Chilean squat lobster fisheries initially targeted Cervimunida johni, beginning in 1953. By the mid-1960s, effort had largely switched to P.monodon. In an effort to conserve stocks, the Chilean government instituted quotas for squat lobsters, and the fishery is closely monitored. In New Zealand, Munida gregaria has been considered as a potential fisheries resource, particularly to feed farmed Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha).|$|E
