40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we {{describe}} how Shenzhen A-share listed companies used <b>funds</b> <b>raised</b> in over-financed IPOs during the 2006 – 2010 period. In exploring {{the relationship between}} internal corporate governance {{and the use of}} <b>funds</b> <b>raised</b> in over-financed IPOs, we find that the use of such funds to engage in severe over-investment behavior is prevalent among listed companies. Reasonable internal corporate governance mechanisms can effectively alleviate over-investment problems listed companies encounter in using <b>funds</b> <b>raised</b> in over-financed IPOs. However, the same individual serving as both chairman and CEO leads to <b>funds</b> <b>raised</b> in over-financed IPOs being over-invested. Moreover, executives driven by high levels of monetary compensation are more likely to use <b>funds</b> <b>raised</b> in such IPOs to engage in over-investment. We find that improving the balance of power between shareholders will help alleviate the over-investment of excess IPO funds. In addition, the over-investment problem is less severe in state-controlled listed companies than in their non-state-controlled listed counterparts. This study provides policy recommendations for Chinese securities regulators to ensure listed companies use <b>funds</b> <b>raised</b> in over-financed IPOs both rationally and effectively...|$|R

5|$|The pier {{opened in}} 1869 {{and served as}} an {{embarkation}} point for paddle steamer excursions for almost exactly 100 years.

5|$|At the time, {{only about}} $15,000 from the {{building}} fund was still available since money had already been spent on buying the property and materials from the Mellon Mansion. Further <b>fund</b> <b>raising</b> generated 1,200 pledges, 95 percent of which were fulfilled: 60 {{percent of the money}} came from 10 percent of the parishioners and approximately 10 percent of the people did not contribute at all. During this time, all of the books concerning the finances of the construction of the new church were kept by ladies of the St. Peter's Cenacle. The ladies not only recorded all of the pledges and collections, but they also recorded all notices and minutes from their meetings. While the church was being built, the Campaigners met almost every evening.|$|E

Now known as Smullin Hall, the library building was designed by architect Pietro Belluschi in the Georgian style of architecture. In 1965, the school received a $450,000 loan {{from the federal government}} for the library. Congressman Al Ullman worked to secure status as a Federal Depository Library in the late 1960s, with status conferred in 1969. In 1980, Willamette began a multi-year <b>fund</b> <b>raising</b> campaign intended to raise funds to renovate academic halls and build a new library, with $18 million total raised during the funding drive.

5|$|The French {{approach}} to funding memorials also relied mainly on voluntary fundraising, but featured {{a greater role}} for the state. A law passed in 1919 provided for a subsidy from central government to local authorities to assist in building memorials; the money was distributed {{in proportion to the}} number of local citizens who had died in the war. Nonetheless the largest French projects, such as the Ossuary of Douaumont, were still paid for mostly through private <b>fund</b> <b>raising</b> across France and the international community: it could take many years to raise the sums required. The Ossuary cost 15 m francs to build; {{at the other end of}} the scale, more modest urban memorials cost around 300,000 francs.|$|E
5|$|The {{most recent}} Grade I {{building}} in North Somerset is Tyntesfield, a Victorian Gothic Revival estate near Wraxall.

The appeal by the National Trust collected £8.2 million from the public in just 100 days and the Trust also received the largest single grant ever by the National Heritage Memorial Fund (at £17.4 million), which caused some controversy. The house is built of Bath stone, and is highly picturesque, bristling with turrets and possessing an elaborate roof.|$|E
