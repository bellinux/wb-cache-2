Shot {{from a different}} angle, the footage shows Harwood draw his arm back to head height before bringing the baton down on Tomlinson's legs. McCallum was filming another incident at the time; the Tomlinson incident was unfolding in the background, unseen by the journalists but recorded by the camera. Half an hour later Alex Thomson, chief correspondent of Channel4 News, was doing a live broadcast when the camera was damaged.

25|$|Herbaceous {{vegetation}} such as {{grasses and}} forbs {{make up the}} majority of the Amargosa vole’s diet, but they may also rely on roots and seeds throughout certain times of the year. When harvesting the seed heads from grasses and forbs, individuals will often stand on their hind feet and chew off the herbaceous stem, causing the seeds to fall into their reach. Around dusk and dawn <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are usually most active, but during extremely hot, dry weather, they adjust their foraging strategy to occur mostly at night.|$|E

25|$|Ceramics {{are very}} {{delicate}} {{in nature and}} damages can occur {{even when they are}} stored away. The most common way in which ceramics become damaged <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are stacked one inside the other. Unless {{this is part of the}} original design, this will typically cause nicks, cracks, or breaks. Some ceramics, depending on their provenance, survive better in different temperature and humidity conditions. Pottery that has been buried, such as from an archaeological site, adheres better to storage at a constant low humidity. Low humidity will help to keep any salts from efflorescing which can mar the surface as well as remove the surface glaze.|$|E

25|$|These {{cetaceans}} {{are highly}} sociable and they regularly form small groups, or pods, that may contain {{between two and}} 25 individuals, {{with an average of}} 10 members. Pods tend to be unstable, meaning individuals tend to move from pod to pod. Radio tracking has even shown belugas can start out in one pod and within a few days be hundreds of miles away from that pod. These pods contain animals of both sexes, and are led by a dominant male. Many hundreds and even thousands of individuals can be present when the pods join together in river estuaries during the summer. This can represent a significant proportion of the total population and <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are most vulnerable to being hunted.|$|E
25|$|During {{the summer}} months the grubs moult and reach their second instar phase, by early autumn they are usually fully grown and have reached their third instar phase, this <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are the most {{detrimental}} to pastures {{as it is the}} final feeding phase before winter. In late autumn and during winter they retreat downwards and out of the top 5cm of soil and burrow down between 50–200mm into the soil. During this phase the grubs undergo a colour change from grayish/white into a yellow/cream colour. Once they reach the appropriate depth, the grub empties its stomach and starts to form a smooth oval shaped cell, the developing wings and legs can be seen through the then translucent skin (epidermal layer) as its making its transition to pupae, the size range is Size range of pupae is 10–30mm in length. This procedure takes place over 30–40 days.|$|E

25|$|These ants are {{not hard}} to control, and most ant killers will solve problems, {{especially}} if controlled {{as soon as the}} problem is noticed. At this point, they could be put under control in just a few days. However, the longer someone waits, the larger the population is and the longer it will take to control the situation, possibly a few weeks. Standing water should be eliminated, as odorous house ants are attracted to moisture. Plants should be trimmed back so they cannot be used to get inside. Cracks, holes and joints should be sealed with polyurethane foam or caulk, especially those that are near the ground. Firewood, rocks and other materials should not be stored next to a home because it encourages nest building. People should {{be on the lookout for}} these ants in late winter and early spring (particularly after rain), as this <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> most commonly appear.|$|E
