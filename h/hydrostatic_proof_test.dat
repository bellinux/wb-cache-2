40|$|A 71 cm {{diameter}} 74 cm length boron/epoxy composite {{rocket motor}} chamber was designed {{based on the}} geometric configuration of the JPL Applications Technology Satellite titanium alloy apogee motor chamber. Because analyses showed large stress concentrations in the domes, the configuration was modified using the same basic constraints for openings and attachments. The rocket motor chamber was then fabricated by filament winding with boron/epoxy tape and hydrostatically tested to failure at 264 N/sq cm, 57. 2 N/sq cm above the design value. Two more rocket motor chambers were fabricated with the same basic constraints, but shortened to 57. 6 cm for a smaller propellant load. The first of these short chambers failed in proof because of filament winding fabrication difficulties. The second chamber was successfully fabricated and passed the <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>proof</b> <b>test...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{life of the}} High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) {{pressure}} vessel is limited by a radiation induced reduction in the material`s fracture toughness. <b>Hydrostatic</b> <b>proof</b> <b>testing</b> and probabilistic fracture mechanics analyses {{are being used to}} meet the intent of the ASME Code, while extending the life of the vessel well beyond its original design value. The most recent probabilistic evaluation is more precise and accounts for the effects of gamma as well as neutron radiation embrittlement.

40|$|Periodic <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>proof</b> <b>testing</b> and {{probabilistic}} {{fracture mechanics}} analyses are performed {{to demonstrate the}} structural integrity and useful life of the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) pressure vessel. Calculations of the hydro-test conditions (pressure, temperature, and frequency) and of the probability of failure account for vessel degradation (flaw growth and radiation-induced embrittlement) that takes place between tests and of the credible worst-case-operating condition. The specified useful life of the vessel is limited by specified maximum permissible calculated probabilities of failure for hydro-test and worst-case-operating conditions. The probability of failure can be calculated with or without accounting for the success (absence of failure) of a test, but if success is accounted for, the calculated probabilities are less and thus the maximum permissible life greater. This report describes a simple method for including {{the success of a}} test...|$|R
40|$|A {{proposal}} {{has been made}} to increase the size of the HFIR HB- 2 and HB- 4 beam tubes and to extend the life of the vessel to 50 EFPY(100 MW). Studies indicate that the increase in radiation-induced embrittlement of the vessel can be tolerated, and an appropriate expanded vessel-materials surveillance program has been devised. This program, which {{is the subject of this}} report, includes additional beam-tube nozzle-material surveillance specimens, relocation of existing specimens of all materials, and additional dosimetry. As an aid in the placement of specimens and dosimeters, extensive two- and three-dimensional neutron and gamma flux/dpa transport calculations were made. Surveillance data will be added to the HFIR vessel (delta) NDTT vs dpa data base, and dosimetry will be used to normalize the calculated fluxes. The updated (delta) NDTT vs dpa correlation and the normalized dpa values will be used in the calculation of the probability of vessel failure. This procedure, in conjunction with periodic <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>proof</b> <b>testing,</b> is used to determine the useful life of the vessel...|$|R
40|$|Extending {{the life}} of the HFIR {{pressure}} vessel from 26 to 50 EFPY (100 MW) requires an updated calculation of the maximum permissible pressure for a range in vessel operating temperatures (40 - 120 F). The maximum permissible pressure is calculated using the equal-potential method, which takes advantage of knowledge gained from periodic <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>proof</b> <b>tests</b> and uses the test conditions (pressure, temperature, and frequency) as input. The maximum permissible pressure decreases with increasing time between hydro tests but is increased each time a test is conducted. The minimum values that occur just prior to a test either increase or decrease with time, depending on the vessel temperature. The minimum value of these minimums is presently specified as the maximum permissible pressure. For three vessel temperatures of particular interest (80, 88, and 110 F) and a nominal time of 3. 0 EFPY(100 MVV) between hydro tests, these pressures are 677, 753, and 850 psi. For the lowest temperature of interest (40 F), the maximum permissible pressure is 295 psi...|$|R
40|$|Safety related-systems {{are subject}} to {{periodic}} <b>proof</b> <b>testing,</b> and it is often assumed that the <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> is perfect. In recent years, partial <b>proof</b> <b>testing</b> has been introduced {{in order to improve}} the system s reliability, and partial <b>proof</b> <b>testing</b> is often referred as imperfect <b>proof</b> <b>testing.</b> In this master s thesis we show that partial <b>proof</b> <b>testing</b> is different from imperfect <b>proof</b> <b>testing,</b> and, a mathematical model for modelling the effect of both partial and imperfect <b>proof</b> <b>testing</b> is proposed. In addition to imperfect and partial <b>proof</b> <b>tests,</b> the system can also be subject to <b>proof</b> <b>testing</b> with short test intervals (intervals in the order of two or three weeks). In theory, a system that is subject to short test intervals is highly reliable, however, there are some factors like (i) human errors that are introduced during <b>proof</b> <b>testing,</b> and (ii) wear, that impact the system's reliability. We present and discuss the major contributors to the unreliability of a system, which is often known as the system's unavailability. In this master's thesis we study four reliability assessment methods for estimating the probability of failure on Demand, PFD_avg of safety-related systems that {{are subject to}} partial and imperfect <b>proof</b> <b>testing.</b> In addition, the effects of short test intervals are also studied.

The objectives of the evaluations were to establish the potential benefit of the pressure <b>proof</b> <b>test,</b> to quantify the most desirable <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> pressure, and to quantify the required <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> interval. The focus of the evaluations was on multiple-site cracks extending from adjacent rivet holes of a typical fuselage longitudinal lap splice joint. The FAA and NASA do not support pressure <b>proof</b> <b>testing</b> the fuselage of aging commercial transport aircraft. The argument against <b>proof</b> <b>testing</b> is as follows: (1) a single <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> does not insure an indefinite life; therefore, the <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> must be repeated at regular intervals; (2) for a proof factor of 1. 33, the required <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> interval must be below 300 flights to account for uncertainties in the evaluation; (3) conducting the <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> at a <b>proof</b> factor of 1. 5 would considerably exceed the fuselage design limit load; therefore, it is not consistent with accepted safe practices; and (4) better safety can be assured by implementing enhanced nondestructive inspection requirements, and adequate reliability can be achieved by an inspection interval several times longer than the <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> interval...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanical}} failure of optical fibers must be avoided to ensure reliability of fiber-based systems. The first stress event in a fiber’s lifetime is the <b>proof</b> <b>test.</b> The <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> will alter the fiber’s strength distribution for all subsequent processing and applications. Thus {{it is critical}} to know the fiber strength distribution after <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> (post-proof strength distribution). It is generally assumed that the <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> truncates the strength distribution at the <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> stress level. But, many users are concerned because they know that theoretically {{it has been shown that}} after <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> the strength of fiber may be much less than the <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> stress level, and that the minimum post-proof strength is determined only by the unloading rate during the <b>proof</b> <b>test.</b> But this theoretical result is not consistent with historical field data. Historically no one has documented failures stresses below the proof stress level.

40|$|<b>Proof</b> pile load <b>tests</b> are an {{important}} means to cope with uncertainties {{in the design and}} construction of pile foundations. In this paper, a systematic method to incorporate the results of <b>proof</b> load <b>tests</b> not conducted to failure into the design of pile foundations is developed. In addition, illustrative acceptance criteria for driven piles based on <b>proof</b> load <b>tests</b> are proposed for use in a reliability-based design. Finally, modifications to conventional <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> procedures are studied so that the value derived from <b>proof</b> <b>tests</b> can be maximized. Whether or not a <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> is conducted to failure, its results can be used to update the probability distribution of the pile capacity using the method proposed in this paper. Hence, contributions of the <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> can be included in foundation design in a logical manner by considering several load test parameters such as the number of tests, the test load, the factor of safety, and test results. This adds value to <b>proof</b> load <b>tests</b> and warrants improvements in the procedures for acceptance of pile foundations using <b>proof</b> load <b>tests.</b> A larger <b>test</b> load for <b>proof</b> <b>tests,</b> say 1. 5 times the predicted pile capacity, is recommended since it will yield more information about the capacity statistics and thus allow for more economical designs...|$|R
