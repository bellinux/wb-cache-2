60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> fully {{understood}} and honoured such a sentiment.|$|E
60|$|Rollo did not answer, but <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{were not}} convinced.|$|E
60|$|Merwell's face blazed and <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{wished to}} annihilate the senator's son.|$|E
50|$|Malik is very rude. And <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{believed}} in his rudeness. (Ambassador Sunde about fellow United Nations ambassador, Soviet Yakov Malik).|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{we think}} he wasn't always a workingman. Tom says <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had been {{in some kind of}} business, and then failed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wonder who}} the old gentleman can be? <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> might have money. That diamond ring he wears must be worth several hundred dollars." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{were very}} sorry, but then, as Mrs Craw said, his looks belied him.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{were going}} to break down, but the next moment he had himself in control.|$|E
60|$|Sureflint made no answer, but <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> pitied the ignorance, humility, and {{condition}} of his friend.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{like the}} Marquess of Grandgo√ªt so much! I hope {{he will be}} {{elevated}} in the peerage: <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> wanted it so! Poor dear man!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] rejoined Malone; but <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{the right}} nail was at last {{hit on the}} head, nevertheless. Moore rose and opened a cupboard.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{certainly}} didn't seem shy of it," [...] said Mr. Hamlin {{with equal}} gravity. [...] "To {{the best of}} my knowledge <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he'd been there before." ...|$|R
60|$|Larry halted again. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{had been}} insulted, and a bitter irony sat upon his lips.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{wanted to}} cry but {{thought better of it}} and bit off a mouthful of candy.|$|E
60|$|Marston {{turned to}} Wyndham, {{but he said}} nothing. His face was set and <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> tried to brace himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should say}} {{a sort of}} foreigner, sir," [...] apologetically replied the butler. [...] "He's wearing a frock-coat, but <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had been walking a good deal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, if you fellers don't know him, I give up," [...] {{said the}} clerk, irritably, [...] "but <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{ought to be}} somebody. He knows his business, anyway." ...|$|R
60|$|Magdalen smiled. The captain's face assumed an {{expression}} of mock gravity; <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> there was a serious side to the question, and <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he meant to put it next.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha, ha!" [...] laughed Tackleton. Hollow as a drum that laugh, though. And <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{could have}} twisted Dot's neck comfortably.|$|E
60|$|A moment <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were inclining to anger. Then {{he burst}} into a coarse laugh, and turned {{to one of his}} gossips.|$|E
60|$|That is, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> didn't; {{but in my}} case Lord Everard has {{his eye on the}} steed pretty closely, {{just the}} same.|$|E
6000|$|... 'What a saintly old man Keggs looks,' said Elsa. 'Don't {{you think}} so? <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{had never even}} thought of doing {{anything}} he shouldn't. I wonder if he ever has?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You seem to {{have brought}} {{something}} to nothing though, {{in the case of}} that honest man. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were just about to honour with his residence the Heart of Mid-Lothian." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're right," [...] {{returned}} Olcott grimly. [...] "We {{must have}} a long talk; but here's the clergyman coming in search of you and <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had something important to say." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{were stopped}} in the passage by the {{appearance}} of Sir Percival. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had been purposely waiting there to see us.|$|E
60|$|For {{the moment}} Captain Grady was speechless. His face grew dark with {{gathering}} wrath, and <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{wanted to eat}} some one up.|$|E
60|$|Hareton, {{during the}} discussion, {{stood with his}} hands in his pockets, too awkward to speak; though <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> did not relish my intrusion.|$|E
6000|$|... "Just what I {{was going}} to suggest, old man. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{were in the middle}} of a colossal spree, and enjoying every minute of it. Don't you think so, Jeeves?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Get some water, Randy," [...] said Earl, as {{he began}} to work over the {{prostrate}} figure. [...] "I wonder if there is a doctor handy. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was half starved to death." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{felt the}} air and the light, and opened my eyes to see Herky-Jerky hauling away on the rope. When he caught sight of me <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> ready to dodge behind the bank.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Wolf {{grinned and}} trotted {{off to do}} her bidding. He found Mr. Gobbler swelled up until <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> must burst, and bragging to Mrs. Gobbler.|$|E
6000|$|MRS. BARTHWICK. This man had dreadful eyes. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could {{commit a}} murder. [...] "I 've 'ad {{nothing to eat}} to-day," [...] he said. Just like that.|$|E
60|$|The {{foreigner}} {{was proud}} and wouldn't beg, but I thought <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> would like to. While he stood gazing at Satan we vanished away {{and landed in}} Ceylon.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, well, I keep meeting Syd and Polly {{circulating}} {{in the same}} directions; she <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she had found something uncommonly nice, and <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> all creation was getting Pollyfied pretty rapidly. Wonder you have n't observed it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come along, old fellows; I'm ever {{so glad to}} see you!" [...] {{cried the}} invalid, with such {{energetic}} demonstrations of the arms that <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> about to fly or crow, like an excited young cockerel.|$|R
60|$|I dined at Greenwich a {{few days}} ago with Delane. He asked me about you with much interest. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had never seen a printing-office, and had never been out of bed after midnight.|$|R
