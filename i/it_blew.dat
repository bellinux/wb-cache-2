The tree became famously known as the Tragedy Oak. <b>It</b> <b>blew</b> down in a storm in the early 1990s. A piece of the tree was saved as a memorial and is on display at nearby Pioneer Elementary School in Hanford.|$|E
5|$|The {{explosive}} lenses {{required by}} the Fat Man had to be fabricated. A small explosive plant was established at Los Alamos known as Site S, {{as it was a}} former sawmill. Groves was appalled at the work practices and safety at Site S, and considered it {{only a matter of time}} before <b>it</b> <b>blew</b> up. On Parsons' recommendation, Groves decided to establish a pilot plant at NOTS, because Caltech had experience in building and operating pilot ordnance plants. He had some misgivings about this, because he thought that the Navy might err too far on the side of workplace safety.|$|E
5|$|A large {{subdivision}} near Route30 sustained minor {{roof and}} tree damage, which was rated as EF0intensity. However, as the tornado was intensifying through the neighborhood, three homes to the subdivision's east suffered more considerable roof and siding damage and was assigned an EF1damage intensity rating. The tornado then crossed Missouri Route 141, where <b>it</b> <b>blew</b> a Honda CR-V into a highway barrier; {{the driver of}} the vehicle suffered critical injuries and died eleven days later from those injuries. After crossing the highway, a number of buildings were damaged including a church, elementary school, and parsonage. Damage in this area was rated as EF2 due to the partial debarking of a nearby tree. Minor tree damage occurred as the tornado moved through Fenton Park and tracked over the Meramec River.|$|E

5|$|On 6 July 1944, Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress 43-37527 N7-X The Prowler of the 603d Bombardment Squadron, USAAF made an {{emergency}} wheels-up landing at RAF Penshurst. The aircraft {{was returning to}} RAF Nuthampstead from a raid on Saint-Omer, France. Eight of the eleven crew bailed out before the aircraft landed. Although a Leigh resident recalled that the aircraft was later repaired and flown out at a light load and taking advantage of favourable winds, official records show that the aircraft was written off. In December 1944, personnel based at Penshurst numbered 26 officers and 166 other ranks. On 2 February 1945, No. 664 Squadron RAF was deployed to Penshurst. They also flew Austers. On 23 March 1945, 664 Squadron were transferred to the Netherlands. On 10 July 1945 Douglas C-47A Dakota 42-108872 of the 23d Fighter Squadron USAAF crashed on landing at RAF Penshurst. The aircraft was written off. RAF Penshurst closed on 13 May 1946. The control tower was demolished in the 1970s. The crewroom was demolished in 1990. A hangar survived until 1991, when <b>it</b> <b>blew</b> down in a storm.|$|E

25|$|During the Jacobite’s {{retreat from}} Stirling to St Ninians, {{the church of}} St Ninians was blown up. It was {{believed}} by the local Presbyterians {{that it had been}} blown up deliberately, but {{it is more likely that}} it was blown up when the powder was being removed. One of the Protestant Jacobites, John Cameron, who was minister to the regiment of Cameron of Lochiel, was passing by the church in open carriage when <b>it</b> <b>blew</b> up. He was in the company of the wife of Murray of Broughton who was thrown from the chaise and was concussed. Nine of the townspeople and a number of Jacobites were buried in the ruins of the church.|$|E
25|$|Issues dropped, and in 1988 {{the service}} was reduced from 5 to 2 days a week, in part perhaps due to {{increasing}} mechanical difficulties. The once famously reliable van had problems with its radiator ensuring {{it had to be}} constantly stopped and attended by the last Mobile Librarian, Malcolm Fletcher. Then <b>it</b> <b>blew</b> a head gasket. With the onset of amalgamation of Birkenhead into the wider North Shore Libraries it was superseded by the system Mobile anyway, and the Bedford was eventually retired in 1992. Not wanted by Motat or the Devonport Museum it eventually went to the North Shore Vintage Car Club. Over its eleven years of operation it had issued over 163 thousand items.|$|E
25|$|Another {{test was}} electronic; {{they were asked}} to {{influence}} the burnout point of a common fuse. After they were given a chance to work it with their mind, an increasing amount of current was run through the fuse until <b>it</b> <b>blew.</b> The two proved to have amazing abilities in this test after a few trials, eventually causing the fuses to blow immediately once they got used to it. In fact, they were simply palming the already blown fuses and then handing them back to the experimenters. They also found that pressing down {{on one end of the}} fuse in its holder, or just touching it briefly, caused the instruments to record unusual results that were interpreted by the experimenters as psi effects.|$|E

25|$|Bonnie Haneline, in 1977, recounted a {{time during}} her {{childhood}} in 1944 {{when she was}} exploring the cave. She left English class, playing 'hooky,' and borrowed a lantern from Mrs. Garrison, the cave owner. She reported to have explored the cave with her friends for several years. While she was inside, her lantern blew out despite no breeze inside the cave. She managed to relight the lantern and <b>it</b> <b>blew</b> out again. Terrified, she crawled along the water path of the cave in the dark until she reached the entrance where she saw an opened can of pork and beans and marshmallows. Later that evening, she learned law enforcement discovered two escaped fugitives {{in the back of}} the cave. She credited the witch with helping her avoid them.|$|E
25|$|The British {{approached}} in three divisions. The fireships were escorted in by several gun-brigs, accompanied by Fulton's torpedo-catamarans, up to 18 in total. The French {{had responded to}} the increased British forces by anchoring their line of frigates further inshore, and deploying a protective line of pinnaces. The French sentries soon spotted the approaching ships and opened fire. Abandoning any hope of achieving surprise the crews on the fireships steered full ahead, set the mechanisms and abandoned ship. The results were visually spectacular but achieved little. One fireship exploded in the gap between two frigates, another passed between the French line and exploded beyond it. Another was stopped by a French pinnace, whose crew boarded it and began to search it. While they were doing this <b>it</b> <b>blew</b> up, killing the French aboard it, and destroying the pinnace alongside. This was the only success of the night, neither the torpedo catamarans nor the exploding casks achieved any successes. The British remained in action until 4am the next morning, when a gale forced them to seek shelter in the Downs.|$|E
25|$|When the two {{submarines}} arrived {{they were}} off Mendoza Island (now Shenggao Island) {{at the entrance of}} the bay. The two then split up, L4 went to patrol around the entrance of the bay and Halahan ordered L5 to patrol within. Bias Bay is surrounded by rocks and that night there was a fleet of fishing junks sheltering inside and constantly moving around the anchorage. Both the rocks and the junks made it difficult for the British to monitor the area without being detected though they succeeded in doing so and on the morning of 20 October they encountered the Irene steaming off Cake Island. She had been taken over by at least eighteen pirates armed with automatic pistols. It was still dark so the L4 was surface cruising with a crew at the 4-inch (102-mm) gun and another pair at the vessel's searchlight. Lieutenant Halahan knew that torpedoes were not helpful in recapturing a pirate held ship but he did have a 4-inch (102-mm) deck gun. Then the Irene was spotted so Halahan maneuvered his submarine into position for firing and when the order was given, the search light was turned on and the gun crew fired a blank warning shot at the steamer. When the shot was ignored a second live round was fired and <b>it</b> <b>blew</b> a hole straight through the ship and killed a pirate who was standing on deck.|$|E

U-23 came under attack by the Italian torpedo boat Airone which first tried to ram the U-boat, and then deployed an explosive paravane. When the paravane contacted the submerged U-23, <b>it</b> <b>blew</b> debris into the air, sinking the submarine with all hands. Like all of her sister boats, U-23 had no wartime successes.|$|E
500|$|The four {{ships of}} Battleship Division Nine—accompanied by the {{destroyer}} —got underway from Lynnhaven Roads, Virginia on 25 November 1917, {{bound for the}} anchorage of the Grand Fleet at Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands. What should have been an uneventful transit was complicated by weather that began bad and only got worse as the voyage progressed. After battling a vicious northwester that brought sleet, hail, and snow, the division was further buffeted by a severe gale off the Grand Banks that began on 29 November. Captain Henry Wiley of Wyoming would later recall of that storm, [...] "At {{the height of the}} gale, <b>it</b> <b>blew</b> as hard as I have ever seen it, and the seas were the worst I could recollect." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1912, Wright {{designed}} what {{he called}} a [...] "tea circle" [...] {{in the middle of the}} courtyard, adjacent to the crown of the hill. This circle was heavily inspired by Jens Jensen's council circles, but also took influence from Japanese wabi-sabi landscape architecture. Unlike Jensen's circles, the rough-cut limestone tea circle was much larger and featured a pool in the center. The circle featured a curved stone bench flanked with Chinese jars built during the Ming Dynasty. A large oak tree stood at the center until <b>it</b> <b>blew</b> down in a storm in 1998. The tea garden also included a large plaster replica of Flower in the Crannied Wall, a statue originally designed by Richard Bock for the Susan Lawrence Dana House; the namesake poem is inscribed on its rear.|$|E
