Two months later, Ciara confirmed she would appear on the album, singing and rapping on the potential first untitled single at the time. Elliott worked on The Cookbook with such producers as the Neptunes, Rich Harrison and Scott Storch. The album included only two songs produced by Timbaland, who produced most or all songs on Elliott's previous albums. She explained, [...] "Me and Tim, this like our sixth album, so if we go any further left, we gonna be on Mars somewhere. We've done everything it is to do. I think both of us came to a spot where we didn't know where to go with each other." [...] She said Timbaland was very involved with the album, supporting or opposing certain producers. Elliott went on to say, [...] "I was eight songs deep and I let Tim listen and he was like, 'Nah, you're <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> direction. You trippin'.' I had to go back in the studio and come up with new records. , he was like, 'This is the Missy people are listening to.'" ...|$|E

As other engineers joined the growing company, he no longer felt needed there and by early 1985, Wozniak left Apple again, stating that the company had [...] "been <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> direction for the last five years".

She reported that she recently familiarized herself with the results of investigation of the former Prosecutor General of Denmark, which indicate that Tymoshenko was not supposed to be convicted in this case.

On October 12, 2015, Spurrier announced that he was resigning as South Carolina's head coach, effective immediately, stating that he felt that the program was <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> direction {{and it was time to}} [...] "fire myself".|$|E
2500|$|In 1985, a power {{struggle}} developed between Jobs and CEO John Sculley, who had been hired two years earlier. The Apple board of directors instructed Sculley to [...] "contain" [...] Jobs and limit his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products. Rather than submit to Sculley's direction, Jobs attempted to oust him from his leadership role at Apple. Sculley found out that Jobs had been attempting to organize a coup and called a board meeting at which Apple's board of directors sided with Sculley and removed Jobs from his managerial duties. Jobs resigned from Apple and founded NeXT Inc. the same year. Wozniak also left Apple in 1985 to pursue other ventures, stating {{that the company had}} [...] "been <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> direction for the last five years".|$|E

2500|$|Sculley's and Jobs's {{respective}} visions for {{the company}} greatly differed. The former favored open architecture computers like the Apple II, sold to education, small business, and home markets less vulnerable to IBM. Jobs wanted the company {{to focus on the}} closed architecture Macintosh as a business alternative to the IBM PC. President and CEO Sculley had little control over chairman of the board Jobs's Macintosh division; it and the Apple II division operated like separate companies, duplicating services. Although its products provided 85% of Apple's sales in early 1985, the company's January 1985 annual meeting did not mention the Apple II division or employees. Many left including Wozniak, who stated that the company had [...] "been <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> direction for the last five years" [...] and sold most of his stock. The Macintosh's failure to defeat the PC strengthened Sculley's position in the company.|$|E

So the idea that we're {{going to go back and}} expand those roles and functions at the expense of the vitality of the core functions that they're designed to perform is <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> way."

2500|$|Despite {{a nucleus}} of young talent and high {{expectations}} for 1999–2000, injuries caused the Bruins to plummet {{to the bottom of}} their division, and they went on track to miss the playoffs.

With his career nearing an end and the team <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> direction, Bourque requested a trade from the fading Bruins so he would {{have a chance to win}} the Stanley Cup. Bourque wanted to be traded to a team on the East Coast such as the Philadelphia Flyers, and Flyers' general manager Bobby Clarke offered the Bruins Andy Delmore and Daymond Langkow for Bourque. Bruins general manager Harry Sinden badly wanted Bourque to have a chance to close out his career with a Cup win and decided to pursue a trade with the Colorado Avalanche instead. Doing his best to keep word of the deal out of the press, Sinden worked out the specifics of the deal and on March 6, 2000, Sinden told Bourque he would be traded to the Avalanche and said, [...] "this may not be your first choice, but this is the team I feel is best." [...] Bourque and fellow veteran Dave Andreychuk were sent to Colorado in exchange for Brian Rolston, Martin Grenier, Sammy Pahlsson, and a first-round draft pick (2000 draft, 27th overall, Martin Samuelsson).|$|E

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Central and Eastern Eurobarometer (CEEB) surveys were begun in 1990, when nationally representative surveys were undertaken on behalf of <b>the</b> European Commission <b>in</b> Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, and the Soviet Union. The surveys, which explored individuals' attitudes toward democratic and economic reform, were carried out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> autumn of each year from 1990 to 1997, in up to twenty countries <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region. An extension of the Eurobarometer series, conducted semi-annually <b>in</b> <b>the</b> member nations of the European Union (EU), the Central and Eastern Eurobarometers also focused on {{public support for the}} EU and on other issues facing Europe as a whole. After the first wave of research, the number of countries was variably expanded to reflect then-current political alignments and realities of access for survey researchers. <b>In</b> each of <b>the</b> countries surveyed, approximately 1, 000 persons aged 15 and over were interviewed in their own homes. <b>The</b> surveys ended <b>in</b> 1997 and were later replaced by the Candidate Countries Eurobarometers. A large selection of Eurobarometer Survey Series datasets, including standard Eurobarometers, Central and Eastern Eurobarometers and Candidate Countries Eurobarometers, are available to browse, analyse and download online via Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences, Data Archive for the Social Sciences' (GESIS) ZACAT service. Data analysis and downloading require online registration with ZACAT and there is no restriction upon who can register. GESIS was formed in 2007 when three independent institutes merged (Social Science Information Centre (IZ) in Bonn, Central Archive for Empirical Social Research in Cologne (ZA), and Centre for Survey Research and Methodology (ZUMA) in Mannheim). Users should note that all CEEBs were deposited by ZA but are now available from GESIS. Further information and documentation {{can be found on the}} GESIS CEEB web pages. Main Topics : The eighth round of Central and Eastern Eurobarometer surveys focused on the topics of evaluation of the economic and democratic reforms (including human rights, perception of Europe and the European Community (and its role in Eastern Europe), attitudes towards NATO membership and knowledge of foreign languages. Respondents were asked many questions that appeared in earlier surveys in this series. These included items on whether respondents felt that things in their country were <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right or <b>wrong</b> direction, how satisfied they were with the way democracy was developing and how it was working in their country, and how much respect there now was for human rights. Respondents were also asked to identify the flags of different countries and organizations, to provide their impressions of the aims and activities of the European Union (EU), and to comment on which countries they believed their future was most closely tied to, how they would vote if referenda on the question of their country's membership <b>in</b> <b>the</b> EU and <b>in</b> NATO were held tomorrow, and the main reasons for their votes. Additional questions focused on which groups within their societies would likely benefit or lose out as ties between their country and the EU increased, whether their country or the EU itself benefitted the most from the current relationship between the two, the ways they might hear about the activities of the EU, and if they wanted to learn more about what the EU was doing on a variety of economic and social issues. New questions explored whether respondents had ever heard of the United Nations, the European Union, or the Council of Europe, and whether they would be more or less likely to vote for EU membership if their country had first joined NATO. Demographic information collected on respondents covers gender, age, highest level of education completed, occupation, voting status, mother tongue and knowledge of other languages, which party they would vote for should there be a general election held tomorrow, nationality/ethnic background, region of residence, size of locality, and income. <br...|$|R
