5000|$|In SQL, you can alias {{tables and}} columns. <b>A</b> table <b>alias</b> is also called a {{correlation}} name. A programmer can use <b>an</b> <b>alias</b> to temporarily assign another name {{to a table}} or column {{for the duration of}} a SELECT query. Assigning <b>an</b> <b>alias</b> does not actually rename the column or table. This is often useful when either tables or their columns have very long or complex names. An alias name could be anything, but usually it is kept short. For example, it might be common to use <b>a</b> table <b>alias</b> such as [...] "pi" [...] for a table named [...] "price_information".|$|R
