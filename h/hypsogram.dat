50|$|The Accruva Formation is {{also known}} as shield plains because of the shield shaped {{structures}} that form in close proximity to each other. The surface of this area is notably different from the other 14 formations mapped on Venus due to the clusters of shield plains, the morphologically smooth transition from the shields to the plains in between the shield plains, and the low amount of deformation within this region, only observably containing a few wrinkle ridges. The shield structures themselves can range from a few kilometers to greater than 10 kilometers in diameter. The formation region tends to occur as equidimensional patches several tens to hundreds of kilometers across. The relief of the formation is hilly due to the clusters of shield domes. The <b>hypsogram</b> of the Accruva Formation almost perfectly matches the overall <b>hypsogram</b> of Venus, which indicates that this formation represents the general topographic level of Venus.|$|E
40|$|Altitude data {{derived from}} the 12. 6 cm radar {{measurements}} obtained at JPL's Goldstone Facility were used to explore the utility {{of this type of}} regional analysis and to develop criteria for the interpretation of hypsometric data for planets where no visual images are available. Examination of the radar-derived <b>hypsogram</b> for Mars shows that the unimodal distribution of elevations contains several second order peaks and is skewed toward a modal elevation of about 3. 5 km above the 6. 1 mb datum. Individual topographic features can be recognized from this <b>hypsogram,</b> but such interpretations are based on the known surface morphology that has been determined from spacecraft images. It is not yet known how, for example, cratered terrain, regional slopes or other morphological features could be identified using the <b>hypsogram</b> if no images were available for ground-truth. The role that large impact craters play in influencing the shape of a <b>hypsogram</b> is being studied...|$|E
40|$|Cassini RADAR {{topography}} {{data are}} used to evaluate Titan’s hypsometric profile, and to make comparisons with other planetary bodies. Titan’s <b>hypsogram</b> is unimodal and strikingly narrow compared with the terrestrial planets. To investigate topographic extremes, a novel variant on the classic <b>hypsogram</b> is introduced, with a logarithmic abscissa to highlight mountainous terrain. In such a plot, {{the top of the}} terrestrial <b>hypsogram</b> is quite distinct from those of Mars and Venus due to the ‘glacial buzz-saw’ that clips terrestrial topography above the snowline. In contrast to the positive skew seen in other hypsograms, with a long tail of positive relief due to mountains, there is an indication (weak, given the limited data for Titan so far) that the Titan <b>hypsogram</b> appears slightly negatively skewed, suggesting a significant population of unfilled depressions. Limited data permit only a simplistic comparison of Titan topography with other icy satellites but we find that the standard deviation of terrain height (albeit at different scales) is similar to those of Ganymede and Europa...|$|E
40|$|It {{is noted}} in the present {{consideration}} of the Venus lithosphere {{and its implications for}} plate tectonics that the major linear elevated regions of Venus, which are associated with Beta Regio and Aphrodite Terra, do not seem to have the shape required for sure interpretation as the divergent plate boundaries of seafloor spreading. Such tectonics instead appear to be confined to the median plains, and may not be resolvable in the Pioneer Venus altimetry data. The ratios of gravity anomalies to topographic heights indicate that surface load compensation occurs at depths greater than about 100 km under the western Aphrodite Terra and 400 km under Beta Regio, with at least some of this compensation probably being maintained by mantle convection. It is also found that the shape of Venus's <b>hypsogram</b> {{is very different from the}} ocean mode of the earth's <b>hypsogram,</b> and it is proposed that Venus tectonics resemble intraplate, basin-and-swell tectonics on earth...|$|E
