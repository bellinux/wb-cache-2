5|$|Ten years later, Dana Scully shows Fox Mulder a {{videotape}} of a religious service led by the now-grown Samuel (Scott Bairstow), who has become an evangelical faith healer for a ministry run by Calvin. The video shows a supposed healing which later left the follower dead. The agents travel to Clarksville, Tennessee, where they attend a service featuring an enthusiastic sermon by Leonard Vance, the man whom Samuel raised from the dead a <b>decade</b> <b>earlier.</b> The agents learn from Calvin that Samuel has gone missing.|$|E
5|$|The fleet {{then moved}} {{north along the}} Ionian coast towards Samos, before {{abruptly}} turning west into the Aegean Sea. The fleet sailed next to Naxos, in order to punish the Naxians for their resistance to the failed expedition that the Persians had mounted there a <b>decade</b> <b>earlier.</b> Many of the inhabitants fled to the mountains; those that the Persians caught were enslaved. The Persians then burnt the city and temples of the Naxians.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the second}} time the Supreme Court had granted certiorari to the Oneida's land claim. Over a <b>decade</b> <b>earlier,</b> in Oneida Indian Nation of New York v.

Since then, Justices William O. Douglas and Potter Stewart had departed, replaced by John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day O'Connor.|$|E

Barrymore joined the company of McKee Rankin, Sidney Drew's father-in-law, on the Chicago leg of their tour, at the W. S. Cleveland Theatre in October 1903. He first played the minor role of Lt. Max von Wendlowski in Magda, and in November when the troupe produced Leah the Forsaken, he took the small part of Max, a village idiot with one spoken line.|$|E
5|$|Detached with Nelson's expeditionary {{squadron}} for the expeditionary {{assault on}} Copenhagen on 2 April, Murray {{was given the}} task of leading the British force into the harbour, using channels he had helped to chart a <b>decade</b> <b>earlier.</b> She eventually passed by four Danish ships, taking fire from each one, before anchoring opposite the Jylland, which she engaged {{for the next four}} hours of the battle. By the time the truce was concluded, the Edgar had taken casualties of 31 killed and 104 wounded. During the peace negotiations with the Danish, and the subsequent foray to watch the Swedish forces at Karlskrona, Murray developed a strong rapport with Nelson, who had replaced Parker after the latter's recall to Britain.|$|E
5|$|In 1619, King James I {{decreed that}} the American colonists of Jamestown {{would need to}} step up efforts to do their fair share towards {{supporting}} England. The Virginia Company enacted the decree, asking Jamestown's land owners to grow and export 100 hemp plants to help support England's cause. Later the colonists would grow it to support its expansion in the Americas. George Washington grew hemp at Mount Vernon {{as one of his}} three primary crops. The use of hemp for rope and fabric later became ubiquitous throughout the 18th and 19th centuries in the United States. Medicinal preparations of cannabis became available in American pharmacies in the 1850s following an introduction to its use in Western medicine by William O'Shaughnessy a <b>decade</b> <b>earlier</b> in 1839.|$|E

In 1849, {{he was chosen}} as a delegate to the state constitutional convention, despite having opposed the calling of such a convention a <b>decade</b> <b>earlier.</b> Wickliffe's political opponents, including Thomas F. Marshall, claimed this showed Wickliffe's political inconsistency, a charge that Wickliffe denied. The following year, Wickliffe was appointed to a committee charged with revising the state's code of laws. On January 8, 1861, he chaired the state Democratic convention in Louisville.|$|E
5|$|Pigs are {{not one of}} {{the main}} forms of {{livestock}} on Welsh farms though there are some specialised units. They used to be kept in small numbers on farms and by rural and urban cottagers. In the twentieth century, many miners in the South Wales valleys still kept a pig in a backyard sty, to be killed for production of fresh and salt pork, bacon, faggots and black pudding. In 2011 there were 25,600 pigs in Wales, less than half the number that were present a <b>decade</b> <b>earlier.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Mahdist Rebellion {{broke out}} in 1881 when a {{religious}} leader, the self-proclaimed Mahdi, declared a jihad against the Egyptian government, which had been subject to British domination since {{the construction of the}} Suez Canal around a <b>decade</b> <b>earlier.</b> Leveraging widespread resentment towards European influence in Egypt and preaching renewal of the Islamic faith, the Mahdi began to accumulate followers and soon presented a serious threat to the government. Early Egyptian-led efforts to suppress the movement failed spectacularly, and their humiliating defeat {{at the hands of the}} outnumbered, outgunned, and undersupplied Mahdist force only increased their leader's fame and reputation.|$|E

The college teams continued to improve their entries {{over the next two years}} when the competition saw its first autonomous takeoff, flight, and landing by a team from the Georgia Institute of Technology. Three years later in 1995 a team from Stanford University was able to acquire a single disk and move it from one side of the arena to the other in a fully autonomous flight—half a <b>decade</b> <b>earlier</b> than some pundits had predicted.|$|E
5|$|The {{public sector}} {{is a major}} {{employer}} in Northern England. Between 2000 and 2008, the majority of new jobs created in Northern England were {{for the government and}} its suppliers and contractors. All three Northern regions have public sector employment above the national average, and North East has the highest level in England with 20.2% of the workforce in the public sector as of 2016 – down from 23.4% a <b>decade</b> <b>earlier.</b> The austerity programme under the government of David Cameron saw significant cuts to public services, and the reduction in public sector employment resulted in job losses for around 3% of the Northern England workforce with significant impact on the regional economy.|$|E
5|$|Two clubs still {{experienced}} financial problems, however. The Phoenix Coyotes eventually {{filed for}} bankruptcy in May 2009. The league then took control over the team later that year in order to stabilize the club's operations, with the hopes of eventually reselling it to a new owner who would be committed {{to stay in the}} Phoenix market. The league did not find a satisfactory buyer for the Coyotes until 2013. The financially struggling Atlanta Thrashers were eventually sold to True North Sports and Entertainment in 2011, who then relocated the team to Winnipeg, a stark reversal of the league's Southward expansion more than a <b>decade</b> <b>earlier.</b>|$|E
