5|$|The blacktip shark {{is popular}} with {{recreational}} anglers in Florida, the Caribbean, and South Africa. It {{is listed as}} a game fish by the International Game Fish Association. Once hooked, this species is a strong, steady fighter that sometimes <b>jumps</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water. Since 1995, the number of blacktip sharks taken by recreational anglers in the United States has approached or surpassed the number taken by commercial fishing. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the blacktip shark as Near Threatened, as its low reproductive rate renders it vulnerable to overfishing. The United States and Australia {{are the only two}} countries that manage fisheries catching blacktip sharks. In both cases, regulation occurs under umbrella management schemes for multiple shark species, such as that for the large coastal sharks category of the US National Marine Fisheries Service Atlantic shark Fisheries Management Plan. No conservation plans specifically for this species have been implemented.|$|E

25|$|In rural areas, fights {{are often}} staged in barns or outdoor pits; in urban areas, fights may occur in garages, basements, warehouses, {{abandoned}} buildings, back alleys, neighborhood playgrounds, {{or in the}} streets. Dog fights usually last until one dog is declared a winner, which occurs when one dog fails to scratch, one dog dies, or one dog <b>jumps</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pit. The loser, if not killed in the fight, is typically killed by the owner through a gun, beatings, or torture, in fights run by criminal gangs in the U.S. However, sometimes dog fights end without declaring a winner. For instance, the dog's owner may call the fight. Dog fighting generates revenue from stud fees, admission fees and gambling. It is also a felony in all 50 U.S. {{states as well as}} the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. In addition, the federal U.S. Animal Welfare Act makes it unlawful for any person to knowingly sell, buy, possess, train, transport, deliver, or receive any dog for purposes of having the dog participate in an animal fighting venture. The act also makes it unlawful for any person to knowingly use the mail service of the United States Postal Service or any instrumentality of interstate commerce for commercial speech for purposes of advertising a dog for use in an animal fighting venture, promoting or in any other manner furthering an animal fighting venture except as performed outside the limits of the States of the United States. Worldwide, several countries have banned dog fighting, but it is still legal in some countries like Japan, Honduras, and parts of Russia.|$|E

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Go to the Top" [...] {{was directed by}} Tomoe Nakano. This is Kumi's first animated music video, and her only collaboration with Nakano. The video opens with people inside a late-night cafe. In the distance, a television screen reads [...] "The next single is a winter ballad single in December"; this is a reference to Kumi's December single Koishikute. The music video features an animated Kumi inside a giant robot, ready to race an opponent. The two robots get ready to race around a city circuit, with the crowd cheering them on. As they race, several obstacles are in the way. The opponent attacks Kumi, but crashes into the stadium. Due to some damage of her robot, she <b>jumps</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> robot with a cyber–motocycle and races to the end. Winning, the opponent's robot is completely damage as the opponent emerges from it. The opponent, a woman, throws a pendant of Kumi and her.

500|$|At {{the firehouse}} they {{discover}} a third firefighter, Tony Diaz, who {{can hear a}} strange humming sound.

Diaz and the other victims had been cleaning 'rust' from the helmet several nights earlier, and Simmons deduces {{that they were all}} infected with an alien virus. Coulson helps Diaz come to terms with his situation, before leaving him to die. Aboard the Bus (the plane that serves as the agents' mobile base) the team are transporting the helmet to the Sandbox, a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility, when Coulson realizes that Simmons has been infected as well. She gives herself only 2 hours to live, but the plane is above the Atlantic Ocean and at least 3 hours from land. Agent Felix Blake at S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters orders Coulson to dump her off the plane rather than risk the safety {{of the rest of the}} team, but Coulson refuses. Rather than let the rest of the team die, Simmons <b>jumps</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plane herself; moments later, Fitz discovers an antidote for the virus. Ward jumps after her with a parachute and the cure, saving her life.|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics upon its release. [...] Duncan Strauss of the Los Angeles Times described the album as [...] "hit-and-miss"; while he praised the [...] "tender tunefulness" [...] of [...] "Behind the Sun", {{he felt that}} the majority of the songs [...] "wear pretty thin pretty fast, further suggesting that this is a band that's in command on stage—but in trouble in the studio." [...] Bill Meredith of AllMusic observed that [...] "the energy of having these four friends from Los Angeles back together <b>jumps</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opening anthem 'Fight Like a Brave' and the experimental 'Funky Crime' ... Slovak and Irons brought things to the Chili Peppers that no one else ever has." [...] Blaine Sayers of Consequence of Sound praised Slovak's guitar work on the album, saying that [...] "Slovak proves with these tracks that he was not just a funk guitarist, but he could rock with the best thrash metal bands of the 80s as well." [...] In The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Greg Kot was less impressed, writing that the album was a minor improvement over the band's last two efforts, but felt that the group's offbeat humor detracted from the album: [...] "The California quartet brings a modicum of structure to The Uplift Mofo Party Plan, but their humor—as their famous 'party on your pussy' chorus demonstrates—wouldn't merit an audience in a high-school locker room." ...|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, at {{the summer}} camp, young bully Nathan and his lackey Mimsy plot to destroy Jimmy during the {{athletic}} competitions so Nathan can be declared the camp's champion. This sub-plot is also narrated in the same style as Intervention. Nathan uses Mimsy as a minion {{to carry out his}} plans to harm Jimmy, but is repeatedly foiled by Mimsy, who either misinterprets his instructions or takes them too literally and causes his plans to backfire. [...] Nathan tries to plant a black mamba in Jimmy's canoe during a race, but Mimsy instead leaves it in Nathan's canoe (when told to put it [...] "in the canoe"). Subsequently, Nathan tries to lead Jimmy's team into dangerous Indian territory during a scavenger hunt, but instead Mimsy switches the maps and switches them again (Nathan demanded him to [...] "Switch the maps! Switch the maps!"), and leads Nathan's team there. When Nathan tries to use a whistle with a shark mating call against Jimmy, Mimsy, who was supposed to blow the whistle underwater, instead swims in the water briefly then blows the whistle on land and a shark <b>jumps</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water and anally rapes Nathan with its nine-inch long penis, according to the Colorado National Wildlife Association. During the talent show, Nathan rigs Jimmy's ukulele with C-4, hoping it will explode during a solo, but when Jimmy cannot perform the solo correctly, Mimsy starts to show Jimmy the correct notes. Nathan interrupts and confronts Mimsy about his failure to follow orders. With a lapse of judgment, Nathan plays the correct notes and causes the ukulele to explode, knocking him away before being further injured by his past plans attacking him again. The ukulele solo is spoofing the Looney Tunes repeated use of the Xylophone gag, where the last note of Believe Me If All Those Endearing Young Charms, is booby trapped, but the protagonist always somehow manages to play it wrong. Nathan is subsequently escorted to an ambulance, but is given the champion's crown by Jimmy. Nathan tells Jimmy he hates him anyway before he is sent away to the hospital.|$|E
500|$|A {{murder of}} giant crows attacks the {{vegetable}} car during the drive, forcing Wirt to veer {{off into a}} cornfield and crash into a scarecrow pole, which scares off the crows. Crops then reveals that they have arrived at the [...] "big city," [...] {{which turns out to}} be an old-fashioned small farm community {{in the middle of the}} cornfield. While Wirt and Beatrice try to repair the car, Greg wanders off with Crops and they explore the city's gazebo garden party. Crops then bumps into a woman made of cabbage. Crops apologizes and there's a sudden announcement that the party's scheduled entertainment has been cancelled. Greg tells Crops that he could fill in for the party with his guitar and singing abilities, and the woman finds herself flattered after learning that Crops is a musician. Back at the car, Wirt, who can't figure out how to fix the vehicle as all it is to him is a cluster of vegetables, and Beatrice, who recommends that all he had to do was turn the crank on the car's front bumper to start the engine, knock over the scarecrow as they leave with the car working. This summons the giant crows, as well as giant turkeys, who terrorize the city and its vegetable inhabitants. Wirt and Beatrice drive up and pick up Greg, while Crops continues to woo the woman with his music, unaware of the chaos around him, even as a crow attacks one of the members of the band he's performing with and as Wirt tries to get his attention. As Wirt, Greg, and Beatrice attempt to escape without Crops, they are set upon by the giant animals, who start to devour the vegetable car. As Wirt tries to fend them off, Greg suddenly <b>jumps</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car unnoticed. Suddenly, they hear Greg's screams from the cornfield. The screams continue, until Wirt and Beatrice finally find Greg in the cornfield, unharmed and yelling with joy as he had finally found a goose big enough for them to ride. The city becomes peaceful once more, as Greg's screams had scared the birds off forever, and John Crops goes back to his countryside home with his soulmate, the cabbage woman. Wirt, Gregory, Beatrice, and their new companion Goose, continue to travel onwards, deeper and deeper, into the Unknown.|$|E
