40|$|The {{electromagnetic}} machines {{like the}} dc, induction, synchronous motor/generator and the transformer have an energy flow framework that is similar. All these machines deal with electrical {{energy in the}} electrical domain that is interfaced with the magnetic domain. Except for the transformer, the other machines also have one more energy interface i. e. with the mechanical domain. In all these machines, the magnetic domain acts as the silent energy manager. The electrical and the mechanical domain energies will have {{to pass through the}} magnetic domain and appropriately get routed. In recognition of the commonality of this pattern of energy flow, this thesis proposes a generalised model of a multiphase electromagnetic device wherein the dc machine, induction machine, synchronous machine and the transformers are special cases of the proposed generalised model. This is derived using bond graphs that is based on the underlining principle of Energy Flow rooted in the concept of Conservation of Energy. A model is a set of mathematical equations representing a physical system. A model is as good as a modeller understanding of the physical system and the underlying approximation he makes while writing down the equations describing the models behaviour to the stimulus. A modelling language tool, which can cut down the approximations made by using the power of identified analogous characteristics across the physical domain, can help make a model more close to real life situation. Bond Graph is such a modelling language which is powerful enough to model the non-linear, multi-disciplinary, hybrid continuous-discrete phenomena encountered in a real life physical system. Bond graphs as a modelling tool was introduced by Professor H. Paynter at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1959. The Bond Graph methodology is based on consideration of energy flows between the ports of the components of an engineering system. Bond Graph methodology enables one to develop a graphical model that is consistent with the first principle of energy conservation without having the need to start with establishing and reformulating equations. The derivation of a mathematical model from the graphical description is automated by software tools. As a consequence, a modeller using this methodology can focus on modelling of the physical system. In the graphical representation of bond graph the vertices of a bond graph denote subsystems, system components or elements, while the edges, called power bonds, represent energy flows between them. The nodes of a bond graph have power ports where energy can enter or <b>exit.</b> <b>Bond</b> graph models are developed in a hierarchical top-down or bottom-up approach by using component models or elements from model libraries. An electromagnetic machine is a black box having an assemblage of windings in iron resulting in a combination of input/output ports on shaft and electrical terminals. Abstraction of an machine model by a modeller matching the vision of the observer above is an ideal goal. Bond graph methodology is an appropriate tool for trying to reach this goal as it is based on object oriented modelling techniques. There have been few attempts to model electric machine in bond graph earlier. A well established DC motor bond graph has been widely used in all bond graph literature. But AC rotating machine being a higher order nonlinear system poses a tougher challenge. Here too, there have been few attempts in modelling AC machines. It is observed that majority of AC machine bond graph models have been built up from their mathematical models. But as the bond graph modelling technique is based on the unifying theory of energy exchange, better insight into the system is achievable if the model is conceptualised from its physical structure. This thesis starts from the basic theory of energy port to conceptualise the generalised model from physical correspondence. In this thesis a Rotating Electrical Machine is studied as a physical system. The energy ports inside this physical system is identified. When a physical system receives the energy through its energy port in one energy cycle, it processes this energy in one of the three ways. The received energy is converted into useful work or it is dissipated or stored. The storage can further be classified into two ways, either as kinetic energy or as potential energy. For a rotating electric machine the input-output port for energy exchange are either in electrical or mechanical domain depending on the class of the machine. The magnetic domain across all class of electromagnetic device acts as the energy manager. In order to capture the features of the energy jumping across the air gap in a rotating electrical machine, wherein the magnetic fields from spatially distributed windings of the stator and rotor interplay, an Axis Rotator (AR) element -a mathematical commutator, is introduced in this thesis as a new bond graph element. In a multiphase device, the energy from the various phases and spatial axes are transferred through the axis rotator element. The Axis Rotator is a critical element which helps distinguish between the various classes of electromagnetic devices. The defining features of the Axis Rotator helps in deriving the various special electromagnetic devices (such as the dc machine, induction machine, synchronous machine and the transformer) from the generalised model. The Axis Rotator exists in the magnetic domain. It naturally inherits the characteristics of the magnetic domain. The Axis Rotator as a bond graph element is complex. In a specific case of 3 φ Induction Motor an alternative bond graph model with all integral elements is developed. By one to one correspondence with the AR bond graph model, the inner component of ’AR’ can be identified. Another advantage of using this model is that saturable and non-saturable magnetic permeance can be separated out, a useful feature in the nonlinear model discussed next. One of the most distinguishing features of the magnetic domain is the existence of Magnetic Hysteresis. Magnetic Hysteresis is a well understood and studied subject. But this physical process is wilfully ignored by the modelling community at large. The main reason for this is the difficulty of modelling a nonlinear phenomena. The bond graph modelling naturally allows the inclusion of such non-idealities within its framework. This thesis proposes the generalised model along with the inclusion of magnetic non-linearities and non-idealities into the model of the system. This inherent strength of bond graph model flows {{from the fact that the}} models in bond graph are developed from the first principles of energy conversation and the mathematical equations are derived later from the evolved graph. The tools that are available for bond graph simulation are not adequate for power electronics systems. The existing tools do not address space vectors and frame transformations. As a consequence it is difficult to simulate the electromagnetic device models developed in this thesis. The need for a bond graph tool to address vectors and frame transformations, a common occurrence in electric machines dynamic model study was acutely felt. This necessitated a support for handling complex data class from the underlying mathematical engine of the software. MATLAB/Simulink is the commonly available mathematical tool which has a support for complex variables. Therefore during the course of this research work a new software tool box was developed which meets the need of electromagnetic machines in particular and other engineering domains in general. For developing the new bond graph simulation software, the language extender approach was chosen, as it combines the capabilities of existing popular mathematical engine with its tested graphical frontend and the flexibility of combining different modelling technique like bond graph, block diagram, equations etc. It also ensures portability as they are compiled by interpreted language compiler of the mathematical engine and are thus independent of the computer operating system. C-MEX S-function methodology was used to develop the software as it has access to lower level functions and methods of the underlying mathematical engine. This helps in speeding up the software execution time alongwith the flexibility in defining new complex elements like the Nonlinear Axis Rotator. In conclusion, this thesis makes the following contributions: (i) The Axis rotator concept to handle space vectors and frame transformations, (ii) generalised model of the electromagnetic device, (iii) introduction of the saturation and hysteresis non-linearity in the magnetic domain, (iv) development of the bond graph toolbox to handle vector and frame transformations...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a pricing model for secondary market debt {{designed to assess}} {{the market value of}} various forms of guarantees and the impact of debt reduction on the value of remaining claims. The model is more flexible and realistic than other models. The technique used, option pricing, accounts for the sources and nature of risks on sovereign debt. It is extremely flexible in handling different maturity schedules, differences in seniority, and expectations about the availability of foreign exchange and willingness to pay. The model is applied to Mexico. It first prices the value of a general obligation claim. It then prices claimss with fixed and rolling interest guarantees. It derives specific market values for general obligation debt and for collateralized <b>exit</b> <b>bonds</b> and schemes on the secondary market price. It then concludes that the terms of the new bonds are in accord with recent secondary market prices of the existing debt. Finally, the paper shows that the three debt restructuring options offered to individual banks are not equivalent if the newly created <b>exit</b> <b>bonds</b> are senior to new money claims. The new money option is worth considerably less. Banks&Banking Reform,Economic Theory&Research,Strategic Debt Management,Environmental Economics&Policies,Markets and Market Access...|$|R

40|$|The Baker Plan {{essentially}} made existing {{strategy on}} the debt problem more concrete. Like existing policy, it rejected a bankruptcy approach to the problem. It assumed that the principal debtor countries could grow {{their way out of}} the debt problem and could expand their exports enough over time to reduce their debt burden to normal levels. It called for structural reform, and it continued the adjustment efforts in the debtor country in return for financial support from foreign official and bank creditors. The plan did shift emphasis, however: from short-term balance of payments stabilization to longer-term development objectives, and thus from the IMF to the World Bank as the lead institution in debt management. The basic international debt strategy remains valid, but intensified policy efforts are necessary. Banks should provide multiyear new money packages, <b>exit</b> <b>bonds</b> should be guaranteed to allow voluntary debt reduction by banks, and net capital flows to the highly indebted countries should be raised 15 billion dollars a year.

Common topographical features were observed across {{a wide variety of}} β-turn types.

This simplification was made possible by the reduction of the β-turn structure into two conformationally invariant units, the median geometries of which are reported herein.

40|$|The {{world over}} {{municipalities}} and cities often rely on capital markets for their long term financing needs. It is envisaged that such debt issues accelerate {{the development of}} cities. The rationale is that since the projects are supposed to benefit the public over time, the issuance of debt to spread the payments between generations is optimal. Municipal bonds are still unexplored as a mechanism of financing capital projects of municipalities in Uganda. This study assesses the legality, the advantages and challenges as well as likely projects to initiate the Municipal bond market in Uganda. It is legally possible for local governments to issue bonds; they can borrow up to 25 percent of their revenue. However, the conditionality in the law that requires them to maintain a balanced budget may be a limiting factor.

40|$|Abstract. A new {{analytical}} model for cold and hot bond rolling of clad sheet unbounded before rolling is derived {{to investigate the}} stress field of the clad sheet at the roll gap by using the direct formulation without the Runge Kutta numerical method. Constant shear friction between the rolls and the clad sheet is assumed. Due to the clad sheet unbounded before rolling, double-layer sheets are not bonded {{at the entrance of}} the roll gap. Thus the stress field of the roll gap for this model is different from that for clad sheet bonded firmly before rolling. In this study, the neutral point between the rolls and the clad sheet, the rolling pressure distribution along the contact interface between the rolls and the clad sheet, the horizontal stresses in the component layers of the clad sheet, the rolling force, and the rolling torque etc., can be easily and rapidly calculated by using the developed {{analytical model}}. In addition, it is a valuable result from this study to obtain the bonding point of the interface and the thickness ratio of clad sheet at the <b>exit.</b> Furthermore, the <b>bonding</b> conditions for the unbounded clad sheet are found to offer useful knowledge in performing bond rolling to avoid manufacturing defects...|$|R
30|$|In {{the case}} of Cl−(H 2 O) 4, the semiempirical methods show that the most stable {{structure}} takes the C 4 structure, {{which is consistent with}} the higher calculation results without ZPE corrections. When considering ZPE corrections, B 3 LYP shows that the Cs structure becomes the most stable, while HF and MP 2 still favor the C 4 structure. The PM 6 and PM 6 -DH+ methods show that the shortest r(Cl…Hnear) and r(Cl…O) and largest θ(Cl…H-O) come up in the second hydration shell's Cs′ structure. The results are consistent with the other calculations and indicate that the strongest ionic hydrogen <b>bond</b> <b>exits</b> in the second hydration shell structure of Cl−(H 2 O) 4. The longest r(Cl…Hnear) and r(Cl…O) appear in the Cs structure for semiempirical methods and in the C 2 structure for higher calculations, respectively. The smallest θ(Cl…H-O) is obtained in the stable structure with C 2 symmetry for all calculations. We note that the Cs′ structure of Cl−(H 2 O) 4 is reported here for the first time. It is a different configuration from the Cs structure found previously. In the Cs′ structure, it is interesting that the strength of the single ionic hydrogen bond is stronger than that of the other two symmetric ionic hydrogen bonds, while it is contrary to {{the case of}} the Cs structure. This new local minimum obtained from PM 6 and PM 6 -DH+ methods could be verified through ab initio and DFT results.|$|R

No records were found which show that any previous nozzles {{were exposed to}} air temperatures as low as those seen by the Flight 5 nozzles. Thermal analysis shows that {{the temperature of the}} fixed housing, and forward and aft exit cone components dropped as low as - 10 F. Structural analysis of the nozzles at these low temperatures show the forward and aft <b>exit</b> cone adhesive <b>bonds</b> to have a positive margin of safety, based on a 2. 0 safety factor. These analyses show the normal and shear stresses in the fixed housing bond as low values. However, the hoop and meridinal stresses were predicted to be in the 4000 psi range; the failure stress allowable of EA 913 NA adhesive at - 7 F. If the bonds did break in directions perpendicular to the surfaces, called bond crazing, no normal bond strength would be lost. Testing was conducted in two phases, showing that no degradation to the adhesive bonds occurred while the Flight 5 nozzles were subjected to subzero temperatures. The results of these tests are documented. Phase 1 testing cooled a full-scale RSRM insulated fixed housing to - 13 F, with extensive bondline inspections.

40|$|In {{this work}} we studied the {{efficiency}} of the benchmarks used in the asset management industry. In chapter 2 we analyzed {{the efficiency of}} the benchmark used for the government bond markets. We found that for the Emerging Market Bonds an equally weighted index for the country weights is probably the more suited because guarantees maximum diversification of country risk but for the Eurozone government bond market we found a GDP weighted index is better because the most important matter is to avoid a higher weight for highly indebted countries. In chapter 3 we analyzed the efficiency of a Derivatives Index to invest in the European corporate bond market instead of a Cash Index. We can state that the two indexes are similar in terms of returns, but that the Derivatives Index is less risky because it has a lower volatility, has values of skewness and kurtosis closer to those of a normal distribution and is a more liquid instrument, as the autocorrelation is not significant. In chapter 4 it is analyzed the impact of fallen angels on the corporate bond portfolios. Our analysis investigated the impact of the month-end rebalancing of the ML Emu Non Financial Corporate Index for the <b>exit</b> of downgraded <b>bond</b> (the event).

30|$|In {{the case}} of F−(H 2 O) 4, PM 6 and PM 6 -DH+ show that the most stable {{structure}} takes the C 1 symmetry, and F− {{is located at the}} surface of the clusters. However, in the global minimum optimized by HF and B 3 LYP, F− {{is in the middle of}} the cluster with the C 1 symmetry. Besides, MP 2 favors the Cs symmetry with a 0.4 -kcal/mol binding energy higher than the C 1 symmetry. The binding energy of the C 1 structure by PM 6 -DH+ is closer to MP 2 in comparison with PM 6. However, the binding energy differences between C 1 and other symmetries by PM 6 or PM 6 -DH+ are greater than 6 kcal/mol, as compared with the differences of less than 2 kcal/mol in the MP 2 level. Since the energy differences between the stable configurations are quite small at the MP 2 level, the cluster tends to be delocalized and has the coexistence of several configurations. However, the semiempirical results indicate a more localized structure of the C 1 symmetry. In this structure, the F…H distance (1.040 Å) at the PM 6 -DH+ level is close to the isolated HF bond distance (0.966 Å). Thus, the structure of HF(OH−)(H 2 O) 3 is probably formed. From the results of ab initio and DFT calculations, the longest r(F…Hnear) and r(F…O) appear in the transition state structure with the Ci symmetry. The largest and smallest θ(F…H-O) appear in the C 4 h symmetry and C 1 structure, respectively. However, the semiempirical results show that the longest r(F…Hnear) and r(F…O) appear in the C 1 and Cs structures, respectively, while the largest and smallest θ(F…H-O) both appear in the C 2 structure. Similar to {{the case of}} n = 3, the ab initio and DFT calculations agree that the shortest r(F…Hnear) and r(F…O) appear in the Cs structure, which indicates that the strongest hydrogen <b>bond</b> <b>exits</b> in a second hydration shell structure.|$|R
