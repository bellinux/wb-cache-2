2500|$|In the September 1, 1995, {{article for}} the Shambhala Sun, [...] "bell hooks talks to John Perry Barlow", Barlow {{reflects}} upon Cynthia Horner passing away: [...] "It {{seems to me that}} what we’re here to do is to learn about love in the presence of fear... You pass away from the moment into the infinite, where there are no moments and where there’s no time. Here in an embodied state, the body, like all physical things, participates in entropy and all the other artifacts of time. There’s a thin but nevertheless impermeable membrane between the chronological and the timeless that has become much more real to me since my lover died a year ago. Even though I feel her soul, the absence of her body feels like an enormous barrier. The absence of the spoken word, the absence of the sound of her voice, or the touch of her skin. All the things that only can be done by souls with bodies on them... But you know the only time that I feel in contact with her, really, is when her spirit temporarily borrows someone else’s body to dance. Like the moment that you and I were dancing up in your apartment a few months ago. And suddenly she was in you and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> there. You quit dancing the way you danced and started dancing the way she danced. And it was almost like a practical joke that she was playing in a way." ...|$|E
60|$|I did {{not look}} at her, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> standing, {{watching}} me. If I had looked up, she would, I knew, have held out her arms to me....|$|E
60|$|I {{breathed a}} sigh of relief, and so did Victory. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> body quiver as she lay pressed close to me, our cheeks almost {{touching}} as we both peered through the same small opening in the foliage.|$|E
60|$|And all {{the while}} we sweltered in the terrible heat, for the sun pierced through the deck {{planking}} of the vessel, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> by <b>her</b> lack of motion that we were becalmed and drifting. I stood up, and by resting my heels upon a rib {{of the ship and}} my back against her side, I found myself in a position whence <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see the feet of the passers-by on the deck above.|$|R
6000|$|I {{wondered}} what my double {{there in the}} sail locker thought of this commotion. He was able to hear everything--and perhaps {{he was able to}} understand why, on my conscience, it had to be thus close--no less. My first order [...] "Hard alee!" [...] re-echoed ominously under the towering shadow of Koh-ring as if I had shouted in a mountain gorge. And then I watched the land intently. In that smooth water and light wind it was impossible to feel the ship coming-to. No! <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>feel</b> <b>her.</b> And my second self was making now ready to ship out and lower himself overboard. Perhaps he was gone already...? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{suppose you}} mean," [...] she exclaimed, [...] "for me to hang myself!--for that, I assure you, {{is not at}} all what I'm {{prepared}} for." [...] Then she seemed again to give me the magnificence of her youth. It wasn't, throughout, I was to feel, that she at all had abysses of irony, for she in fact happily needed none. Her triumph was in itself ironic enough, and all her point in her sense of her freshness. [...] "Were you really so impatient?" [...] But as I inevitably hung fire a little she continued before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> answer; which somewhat helped me indeed by showing the one flaw in her confidence. More extraordinary perhaps than anything else, moreover, was just my perception of this; which gives the value of all that each of us so visibly felt the other to have put together, to have been making out and gathering in, since we parted, on the terrace, after seeing Mrs. Server and Briss come up from under their tree. We had, of a truth, arrived at our results--though mine were naturally the ones for me to believe in; and it was prodigious that we openly met not at all where we had last left each other, but exactly on what our subsequent suppressed processes had achieved. We hadn't named them--hadn't alluded to them, and we couldn't, no doubt, have done either; but they were none the less intensely there between us, with the whole bright, empty scene given up to them. Only she had her shrewd sense that mine, for reasons, might have been still more occult than her own. Hadn't I possibly burrowed the deeper--to come out in some uncalculated place behind her back? That was the flaw in her confidence. She had in spite of it her firm ground, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel,</b> to do <b>her</b> justice, how different a complacency it was from such smug ignorance as Lady John's. If I didn't fear to seem to drivel about my own knowledge I should say that she had, in addition to all the rest of her [...] "pull," [...] the benefit of striking me as worthy of me. She was in the mystic circle--not one of us more; she knew the size of it; and it was our now being in it alone together, with everyone else out and with the size greater than it had yet been at all--it was this that gave the hour, in fine, so sharp a stamp.|$|R
60|$|For a {{long while}} she {{contemplated}} me, for as before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> eyes searching me {{from head to foot}} and as it were looking through me as though she would discover my very soul. Then at length she moved, waving those two ivory arms of hers outwards with a kind of swimming stroke, whereon the women to right and left of her turned and glided away, I know not whither.|$|E
60|$|An abominable night! A {{wonderful}} night! Sleep? I suppose I did sleep, in catnaps, but I swear I heard every bell struck until three-thirty. Then came a change, an easement. No longer {{was it a}} stubborn, loggy {{fight against}} pressures. The Elsinore moved. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> slip, and slide, and send, and soar. Whereas before she had been flung continually down to port, she now rolled as far to one side as to the other.|$|E
6000|$|... "I know it was," [...] she answered. She set {{her elbows}} on the seat's tall back until <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> sweet breath upon my brow. [...] "And should I bear you a resentment, then? My poor Agostino, have I no heart to feel? Am I but a cold, {{reasoning}} intelligence like that thing my husband? O God! To have been mated to that withered pedant! To have been sacrificed, to have been sold into such bondage! Me miserable!" ...|$|E
60|$|She came to him, and in {{his arms}} he <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> trembling.|$|R
6000|$|But it was {{a comfort}} {{that there could be}} no uneasiness in a {{connection}} with anything so beatific as the radiant image of my little girl, the vision of whose angelic beauty had probably more than anything else to do with the restlessness that, before morning, made me several times rise and wander about my room to take in the whole picture and prospect; to watch, from my open window, the faint summer dawn, to look at such portions {{of the rest of the}} house as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> catch, and to listen, while, in the fading dusk, the first birds began to twitter, for the possible recurrence of a sound or two, less natural and not without, but within, that I had fancied I heard. There had been a moment when I believed I recognized, faint and far, the cry of a child; there had been another when I found myself just consciously starting as at the passage, before my door, of a light footstep. But these fancies were not marked enough not to be thrown off, and it is only in the light, or the gloom, I should rather say, of other and subsequent matters that they now come back to me. To watch, teach, [...] "form" [...] little Flora would too evidently be the making of a happy and useful life. It had been agreed between us downstairs that after this first occasion I should have her as a matter of course at night, her small white bed being already arranged, to that end, in my room. What I had undertaken was the whole care of her, and she had remained, just this last time, with Mrs. Grose only as an effect of our consideration for my inevitable strangeness and her natural timidity. In spite of this timidity--which the child herself, in the oddest way in the world, had been perfectly frank and brave about, allowing it, without a sign of uncomfortable consciousness, with the deep, sweet serenity indeed of one of Raphael's holy infants, to be discussed, to be imputed to her, and to determine us--I feel quite sure she would presently like me. It was part of what I already liked Mrs. Grose herself for, the pleasure <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> in my admiration and wonder as I sat at supper with four tall candles and with my pupil, in a high chair and a bib, brightly facing me, between them, over bread and milk. There were naturally things that in Flora's presence could pass between us only as prodigious and gratified looks, obscure and roundabout allusions.|$|R
60|$|We knelt close {{together}} at <b>her</b> feet. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> Mary's heart throbbing, as she pressed nearer and nearer to my side. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> {{my own heart}} quickening its beat, with a fear that was a mystery to me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose so," [...] he said. [...] "You see my father--well, he {{was never}} acclimatized here. He wanted--I don't know what he wanted--but it was a strain. And my mother--I always knew she {{was too good to}} me. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> being too good to me--my mother! Then I went away to school so early. And I must say, the outside world was always more {{naturally}} a home to me than the vicarage--I don't know why." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have been}} to see some pictures," [...] said William. [...] "Oh, dear," [...] he exclaimed, looking about him, [...] "this room reminds me {{of one of the}} worst hours in my existence--when I read a paper, and you all sat round and jeered at me. Katharine was the worst. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> gloating over every mistake I made. Miss Datchet was kind. Miss Datchet just made it {{possible}} for me to get through, I remember." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{difference}} was appreciable at once when that huge spread of canvas opposed the wind. The Elsinore fairly leaped and quivered as she sprang to it, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> eat to windward as she {{at the same}} time drove faster ahead. Also, in the rolls and gusts, she was forced down till her lee-rail buried and the sea foamed level across to her hatches. Mr. Pike watched her like a hawk, and like certain death he watched the Maltese Cockney and Tom Spink at the wheel.|$|E
6000|$|... “Well,” said Nettie with {{a little}} smile, though she <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> heart beating, “I feel more like a torpedo than ever just now.” ...|$|R
60|$|Already {{they were}} closing round him, and he <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> breath upon his cheek, when the charm broke, and he {{wrenched}} himself free.|$|R
60|$|She <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> last {{strength}} going, and {{the barrel}} resisted her. Hans hurried to her, and the barrel went {{out from under}} Michael Dennin.|$|R
60|$|Sally sat {{so still}} and silent that I thought I had angered or {{offended}} her. But I {{did not care}} much, one way or another. Her coquettish fancy {{for me and my}} own trouble had sunk into insignificance. I did not look up at her, though she was so close <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> little, restless foot touching me. The horses in the corrals were trooping up to the bars. Dusk had about given place to night, although in the west a broad flare of golden sky showed bright behind dark mountains.|$|E
60|$|But {{the woman}} from the woods still came nearer and nearer, until <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> hot breath on my face. Her eyes looked into mine, and fascinated them, as she held out her arms to embrace me. I touched her hand, and in an instant the touch ran through me like fire, from head to foot. Then, still looking intently on me with her wild bright eyes, she clasped her supple arms round my neck, and drew me a few paces away with her towards the wood.|$|E
6000|$|... "What a {{difference}}!" [...] {{thought the}} young man--hoary cynic pro tem. [...] "What a miserable deceiving {{difference between the}} manners of a maid's life at dancing times and at others! Look at this lovely Fancy! Through the whole past evening touchable, squeezeable--even kissable! For whole half- hours I held her so chose to me that not {{a sheet of paper}} could have been shipped between us; and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> heart only just outside my own, her life beating on so close to mine, that I was aware of every breath in it. A flit is made upstairs--a hat and a cloak put on--and I no more dare to touch her than--" [...] Thought failed him, and he returned to realities.|$|E
60|$|And for {{a minute}} {{it was his turn}} to study her. And study her he did, till she <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> cheeks {{flushing}} under his gaze.|$|R
60|$|She sobbed, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> the tremor {{run through}} the pelican.|$|R
60|$|We {{were the}} only {{visitors}} who had entered the Torture Tower that morning--so at least said the old custodian--and as we had the place all to ourselves {{were able to make}} a minute and more satisfactory survey than would have otherwise been possible. The custodian, looking to us as the sole source of his gains for the day, was willing to meet our wishes in any way. The Torture Tower is truly a grim place, even now when many thousands of visitors have sent a stream of life, and the joy that follows life, into the place; but at the time I mention it wore its grimmest and most gruesome aspect. The dust of ages seemed to have settled on it, and the darkness and the horror of its memories seem to have become sentient {{in a way that would}} have satisfied the Pantheistic souls of Philo or Spinoza. The lower chamber where we entered was seemingly, in its normal state, filled with incarnate darkness; even the hot sunlight streaming in through the door seemed to be lost in the vast thickness of the walls, and only showed the masonry rough as when the builder's scaffolding had come down, but coated with dust and marked here and there with patches of dark stain which, if walls could speak, could have given their own dread memories of fear and pain. We were glad to pass up the dusty wooden staircase, the custodian leaving the outer door open to light us somewhat on our way; for to our eyes the one long-wick'd, evil-smelling candle stuck in a sconce on the wall gave an inadequate light. When we came up through the open trap in the corner of the chamber overhead, Amelia held on to me so tightly that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> actually <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> heart beat. I must say for my own part that I was not surprised at her fear, for this room was even more gruesome than that below. Here there was certainly more light, but only just sufficient to realise the horrible surroundings of the place. The builders of the tower had evidently intended that only they who should gain the top should have any of the joys of light and prospect. There, as we had noticed from below, were ranges of windows, albeit of mediaeval smallness, but elsewhere in the tower were only a very few narrow slits such as were habitual in places of mediaeval defence. A few of these only lit the chamber, and these so high up in the wall that from no part could the sky be seen through the thickness of the walls. In racks, and leaning in disorder against the walls, were a number of headsmen's swords, great double-handed weapons with broad blade and keen edge. Hard by were several blocks whereon the necks of the victims had lain, with here and there deep notches where the steel had bitten through the guard of flesh and shored into the wood. Round the chamber, placed in all sorts of irregular ways, were many implements of torture which made one's heart ache to see--chairs full of spikes which gave instant and excruciating pain; chairs and couches with dull knobs whose torture was seemingly less, but which, though slower, were equally efficacious; racks, belts, boots, gloves, collars, all made for compressing at will; steel baskets in which the head could be slowly crushed into a pulp if necessary; watchmen's hooks with long handle and knife that cut at resistance--this a speciality of the old Nurnberg police system; and many, many other devices for man's injury to man. Amelia grew quite pale with the horror of the things, but fortunately did not faint, for being a little overcome she sat down on a torture chair, but jumped up again with a shriek, all tendency to faint gone. We both pretended that it was the injury done to her dress by the dust of the chair, and the rusty spikes which had upset her, and Mr. Hutcheson acquiesced in accepting the explanation with a kind-hearted laugh.|$|R
60|$|I {{heard the}} engine whistling, and I felt the speed easing down. I knew the train wasn't going to stop, {{but my mind}} was made up to chance it if she slowed down sufficiently. The right of way at this point took a curve, crossed a bridge over a canal, and cut through the town of Bristol. This {{combination}} compelled slow speed. I clung on to the side-ladder and waited. I didn't know it was the town of Bristol we were approaching. I {{did not know what}} necessitated slackening in speed. All I knew was that I wanted to get off. I strained my eyes in the darkness for a street-crossing on which to land. I was pretty well down the train, and before my car was in the town the engine was past the station and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> making speed again.|$|E
60|$|I {{have the}} most {{confused}} impressions of that walk. I recollect that it was neither night nor day, that morning was dawning but the street-lamps were not yet put out, that the sleet was still falling and that all the ways were deep with it. I recollect a few chilled people passing in the streets. I recollect the wet house-tops, the clogged and bursting gutters and water-spouts, the mounds of blackened ice and snow over which we passed, the narrowness of the courts by which we went. At the same time I remember that the poor girl seemed to be yet telling her story audibly and plainly in my hearing, that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> resting on my arm, that the stained house-fronts put on human shapes and looked at me, that great water-gates seemed to be opening and closing in my head or in the air, and that the unreal things were more substantial than the real.|$|E
60|$|Her lips moved a little, {{and though}} I heard no words I fancied {{it was a}} prayer, then I turned my head forward and {{prepared}} for the struggle. I had small skill in handling canoes, but I had more than average strength, and felt thankful for it as, lifting the light cedar at every wrenching stroke, I drove it toward the fall. Then a whirling mist shot up, there was a deep booming in my ears, the canoe leaped out as into mid-air, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> dropping bodily from beneath us. A heavy splash followed, water was flying everywhere, and a boiling wave lapped in, but the paddle bent under my hand, and breathless and half-blinded we shot out down the tail rush into daylight again. One swift glance over my shoulder showed the slanting spout of water behind Grace's pallid face. The fall apparently must {{have been more than}} a fathom in three yards or so, and I wondered how we had ever come down it alive.|$|E

60|$|Mrs. Charmond embraced Grace {{more and}} more tightly, and the younger woman <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> neighbor's breathings grow deeper and more spasmodic, as though {{uncontrollable}} feelings were germinating.|$|R
60|$|George {{came and}} bent over my shoulder. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> the heavy warmth of him.|$|R
6000|$|There came a {{time when}} Ajor could no longer walk, {{and then it was}} that I picked her up in my arms and carried her. She begged me to leave her, saying that after I found an exit, I could come back and get her; but she knew, and she knew that I knew, that if ever I did leave her, I could never find her again. Yet she insisted. Barely had I {{sufficient}} strength to take a score of steps at a time; then I would have to sink down and rest for five to ten minutes. I don't know what force urged me on and kept me going {{in the face of an}} absolute conviction that my efforts were utterly futile. I counted us already as good as dead; but still I dragged myself along until the time came that I could no longer rise, but could only crawl along a few inches at a time, dragging Ajor beside me. Her sweet voice, now almost inaudible from weakness, implored me to abandon her and save myself--she seemed to think only of me. Of course I couldn't have left her there alone, no matter how much I might have desired to do so; but the fact of the matter was that I didn't desire to leave her. What I said to her then came very simply and naturally to my lips. It couldn't very well have been otherwise, I imagine, for with death so close, I doubt if people are much inclined to heroics. [...] "I would rather not get out at all, Ajor," [...] I said to her, [...] "than to get out without you." [...] We were resting against a rocky wall, and Ajor was leaning against me, her head on my breast. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> press closer to me, and one hand stroked my arm in a weak caress; but she didn't say anything, nor were words necessary.|$|E
60|$|It was {{not till}} late next day that I spoke to Mrs. Grose; the rigor with which I kept my pupils in sight making it often {{difficult}} to meet her privately, and the more as we each felt the importance of not provoking--on {{the part of the}} servants quite as much as on that of the children--any suspicion of a secret flurry or that of a discussion of mysteries. I drew a great security in this particular from her mere smooth aspect. There was nothing in her fresh face to pass on to others my horrible confidences. She believed me, I was sure, absolutely: if she hadn't I don't know what would have become of me, for I couldn't have borne the business alone. But she was a magnificent monument to the blessing of a want of imagination, and if she could see in our little charges nothing but their beauty and amiability, their happiness and cleverness, she had no direct communication with the sources of my trouble. If they had been at all visibly blighted or battered, she would doubtless have grown, on tracing it back, haggard enough to match them; as matters stood, however, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her,</b> when she surveyed them, with her large white arms folded and the habit of serenity in all her look, thank the Lord's mercy that if they were ruined the pieces would still serve. Flights of fancy gave place, in her mind, to a steady fireside glow, and I had already begun to perceive how, with the development of the conviction that--as time went on without a public accident--our young things could, after all, look out for themselves, she addressed her greatest solicitude to the sad case presented by their instructress. That, for myself, was a sound simplification: I could engage that, to the world, my face should tell no tales, but it would have been, in the conditions, an immense added strain to find myself anxious about hers.|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel,</b> {{as well as}} see, that my {{faithful}} servant exerted {{himself to}} the utmost.|$|R
