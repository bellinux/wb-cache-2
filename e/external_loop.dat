30|$|In (Weyns et al. 2013), {{the authors}} report {{the results of}} a {{quasi-experiment}} that investigates whether the use of <b>external</b> feedback <b>loops</b> (when compared with internal adaptation mechanisms) improves the design of SA systems. The design was evaluated with respect to design complexity (in terms of activity complexity and control flow complexity), fault density, and design productivity. The experiment shows that <b>external</b> feedback <b>loops</b> reduce the number of adopted control flow primitives, increasing the design’s understandability and maintainability. They also observed improvements in design productivity when using <b>external</b> feedback <b>loops,</b> but found no significant effects on design complexity in terms of activity complexity. The experiment we present herein tackles a similar design issue but with different treatments, objects, measurements, and hypotheses. While their experiment reveals evidence about the decoupling and reusability benefits of <b>external</b> feedback <b>loops,</b> we believe our experiment contributes by revealing the potential benefits of systematic design knowledge representation and search-based automated design approaches in such a domain.|$|R

40|$|Background: RNA folding {{depends on}} the {{distribution}} of kinetic traps in the landscape of all secondary structures. Kinetic traps in the Nussinov energy model are precisely those secondary structures that are saturated, meaning that no base pair can be added without introducing either a pseudoknot or base triple. In previous work, we investigated asymptotic combinatorics of both random saturated structures and of quasi-random saturated structures, where the latter are constructed by a natural stochastic process. Results: We prove that for quasi-random saturated structures with the uniform distribution, the asymptotic expected number of <b>external</b> <b>loops</b> is O(log n) and the asymptotic expected maximum stem length is O(log n), while under the Zipf distribution, the asymptotic expected number of <b>external</b> <b>loops</b> is O(log 2 n) and the asymptotic expected maximum stem length is O(log n / log logn). Conclusions: Quasi-random saturated structures are generated by a stochastic greedy method, which is simple to implement. Structural features of random saturated structures appear to resemble those of quasi-random saturated structures, and the latter appear to constitute a class for which both the generation of sampled structures as well as a combinatorial investigation of structural features may be simpler to undertake. ...|$|R

40|$|FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (TFL 1) in Arabidopsis are {{homologous}} {{proteins that}} perform opposite functions: FT is an activator of flowering, and TFL 1 is a repressor. It was shown before that change {{of a single}} amino acid (His 88) of TFL 1 to the corresponding amino acid (Tyr) of FT is enough to convert the floral repressor to an activator. However, structural basis of the functional conversion has not been understood. In our molecular dynamics simulations on modified TFL 1 proteins, a hydrogen bond present in native TFL 1 between the His 88 residue and a residue (Asp 144) in a neighboring <b>external</b> <b>loop</b> became broken by change of His 88 to Tyr. This breakage induced conformational change of the <b>external</b> <b>loop</b> whose structure was previously reported to be another key functional determinant. These findings reveal that the two important factors determining the functional specificities of the floral regulators, the key amino acid (His 88) and the <b>external</b> <b>loop,</b> are correlated, and the key amino acid determines the functional specificity indirectly by affecting the conformation of the <b>external</b> <b>loop...</b>|$|E
