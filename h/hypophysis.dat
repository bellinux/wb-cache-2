2500|$|Meesia triqueta {{grows in}} small tufts or cushions. The plants, often large, are acrocarpous and dioicous. In color they are dark-green to grass-green above, {{occasionally}} red-brown below due to dense rhizoids. The plant's stems are not branched or little branched, pale-brown to yellow-brown, closely foliate, and 2–14cm high. [...] Its leaves are decurrent, squarrose (spreading) when moist, triangular to ovate to lanceolate, somewhat crispate (contorted), 2–3½ mm long, and tristichous (in three obvious ranks). The leaf margins are sharply serrate or denticulate {{to the base}} or nearly so, plane or sometimes recurved {{in the middle of}} the leaf. The costa is relatively narrow (less than 1/5 the width of the leaf base), subpercurrent to percurrent, gradually tapering at distal end. The leaf's apex is acute to acuminate (sharply pointed). The lamina is unistratose throughout. The perigonia of Meesia triqueta are terminal in discoid heads. [...] The seta is straight and smooth, brown to yellow-brown, and very long (4–10cm). [...] The capsule is asymmetrical, somewhat pyriform, 2¾–5½ mm long including the neck; the <b>hypophysis</b> (neck) is long (comprising up to ½ of capsule length), moderately well-defined, not much wrinkled when dry; the urn is oblong to short-cylindric, arcuate and asymmetric, brown to yellow-brown, up to 4mm long, and when dry, wrinkled but not regularly sulcate. The operculum is short-conic; the endostome cilia are often rather well-developed. [...] The plant's spores are finely papillose.|$|E

50|$|The {{expression}} glandula pituitaria {{is still}} used as official synonym beside <b>hypophysis</b> {{in the official}} Latin nomenclature Terminologia Anatomica. In the seventeenth century the supposed function of the pituitary gland to produce nasal mucus was debunked. The expression glandula pituitaria and its English equivalent pituitary gland can only be justified from a historical point of view. The inclusion of this synonym is merely justified by noting that the main term <b>hypophysis</b> is a much less popular term.|$|E

50|$|Houssay’s {{worked in}} many fields of physiology, {{such as the}} nervous, digestive, {{respiratory}} and circulatory systems, but his main contribution, which was recognized by the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine of 1947, was on the experimental investigation {{of the role of}} the anterior <b>hypophysis</b> gland in the metabolism of carbohydrates, particularly in diabetes mellitus. Houssay demonstrated in the 1930s the diabetogenic effect anterior <b>hypophysis</b> extracts and the decrease in diabetes severity with anterior hypophysectomy. These discoveries stimulated the study of hormonal feedback control mechanisms which are central to all aspects of modern endocrinology.|$|E
50|$|Ponfick {{is remembered}} for his pioneer {{research}} of actinomycosis, and his {{recognition of the}} causative role Actinomyces played in human actinomycosis.

In 1882 he published Die Actinomykose des Menschen, eine neue Infectionskrankheit (Actinomycosis of humans, a new infectious disease) {{in regards to the}} disease. He also made significant contributions in his research of myxedema, writing two articles on the disorder, Myxoedem und <b>Hypophysis</b> (Myxedema and <b>hypophysis)</b> and Zur Lehre vom Myxoedem (The doctrine of myxedema).|$|E

50|$|The neurohypophysial hormones form {{a family}} of {{structurally}} and functionally related peptide hormones. Their main representatives are oxytocin and vasopressin. They are named for being secreted by the neurohypophysis, i.e. the posterior pituitary gland (<b>hypophysis</b> refers to the pituitary gland), itself a neuronal projection from the hypothalamus.|$|E

It belongs to the middle cranial fossa.In front of the hypophyseal fossa is the tuberculum sellae.|$|E
50|$|In {{vertebrate}} anatomy, the pituitary gland, or <b>hypophysis,</b> is an {{endocrine gland}} {{about the size}} of a pea and weighing 0.5 g in humans. It is a protrusion off the bottom of the hypothalamus at the base of the brain. The <b>hypophysis</b> rests upon the hypophysial fossa of the sphenoid bone in the center of the middle cranial fossa and is surrounded by a small bony cavity (sella turcica) covered by a dural fold (diaphragma sellae). The anterior pituitary (or adenohypophysis) is a lobe of the gland that regulates several physiological processes (including stress, growth, reproduction, and lactation). The intermediate lobe synthesizes and secretes melanocyte-stimulating hormone. The posterior pituitary (or neurohypophysis) is a lobe of the gland that is functionally connected to the hypothalamus by the median eminence via a small tube called the pituitary stalk (also called the infundibular stalk or the infundibulum).|$|E
50|$|In plants, suspensors {{are found}} in zygotes in angiosperms, {{connecting}} the endosperm to an embryo. Usually in dicots the suspensor cells divide transversally {{a few times to}} form a filamentous suspensor of 6-10 cells. The suspensor helps in pushing the embryo into the endosperm. The first cell of the suspensor towards the micropylar end becomes swollen and functions as a haustorium. The haustorium has wall ingrowths similar to those of a transfer cell. The last of the suspensors {{at the end of the}} embryo is known as <b>hypophysis.</b> <b>Hypophysis</b> later gives rise to the radicle and root cap. During embryo development in angiosperm seeds, normal development involves asymmetrical division of the unicellular embryo, inducing polarity. The smaller terminal cell divides to become the proembryo while the larger basal cell divides laterally to form the suspensor. The suspensor is analogous to a placental mammalian's umbilical cord.|$|E
50|$|The {{sella turcica}} (Latin for Turkish seat) is a saddle-shaped {{depression}} {{in the body of}} the sphenoid bone of the human skull and of the skulls of other hominids including chimpanzees, orangutans, and gorillas. It serves as a cephalometric landmark. The seat of the saddle, the deepest part of the sella turcica known as the hypophyseal fossa, holds the pituitary gland (<b>hypophysis).</b>|$|E
5000|$|The anatomist Samuel Thomas von Sömmerring {{coined the}} name <b>hypophysis.</b> This name {{consists}} of ὑπό ('under') and φύειν ('to grow'). In later Greek ὑπόφυσις is used differently by Greek physicians as outgrowth. Sömmering {{also used the}} equivalent expression appendix cerebri, with appendix as appendage. In various languages, Hirnanhang [...] in German and hersenaanhangsel [...] in Dutch, the terms are derived from appendix cerebri.|$|E
50|$|Broodiness {{is due to}} the {{secretion}} of {{the hormone}} prolactin by the anterior lobe of the <b>hypophysis.</b> Prolactin injection in hens provokes egg laying to stop within a few days, vitellum reabsorbtion, ovary regression (hens only have a left ovary) and finally broodiness. However, attempts to stop broodiness by the administration of several hormones have failed because this state, once evoked, requires time to revert.|$|E
50|$|In {{the most}} {{primitive}} living vertebrates, the lampreys and hagfish, {{there is only}} one nostril and olfactory pouch. Indeed, the nostril also opens into the <b>hypophysis.</b> This is not necessarily, however, a primitive trait, but one that may have arisen later in the evolution of these particular groups. For example, the fossil heterostracans had paired nostrils, and these were also a very early vertebrate group.|$|E
50|$|A major {{organ of}} the {{endocrine}} system, the anterior pituitary (also called the adenohypophysis or pars anterior), is the glandular, anterior lobe that together with the posterior lobe (posterior pituitary, or the neurohypophysis) makes up the pituitary gland (<b>hypophysis).</b> The anterior pituitary regulates several physiological processes including stress, growth, reproduction and lactation. Proper functioning of the anterior pituitary and of the organs it regulates can often be ascertained via blood tests that measure hormone levels.|$|E

Reviving her, Kilgore imprisons Hellcow and collects her [...] "vampiric milk", which he believes he can exploit to cure his tuberculosis as well as attain immortality. When this plan does not fully work, Kilgore abducts Deadpool and extracts his <b>hypophysis.</b> Kilgore digests it, so as to give himself the power of self-healing that Deadpool has.|$|E
5000|$|Releasing {{hormones and}} {{inhibiting}} hormones are hormones whose main {{purpose is to}} control the release of other hormones, either by stimulating or inhibiting their release. They are also called liberins (...) and statins (...) (respectively), or releasing factors and inhibiting factors. The principal examples are hypothalamic-pituitary hormones that can be classified from several viewpoints: they are hypothalamic hormones (originating in the hypothalamus), they are hypophysiotropic hormones (affecting the <b>hypophysis,</b> that is, the pituitary gland), and they are tropic hormones (having other endocrine glands as their target).|$|E
5000|$|In 1901 he {{provided}} a comprehensive description of dystrophia adiposogenitalis, {{of which he}} published a paper titled Ein Fall von Tumor der <b>Hypophysis</b> cerebri ohne Akromegalie. This disorder is characterized by feminine obesity along with retarded sexual maturity, and is caused by tumors of the pituitary. In honor of his discovery, this condition was to become known as [...] "Fröhlich's syndrome". It is {{sometimes referred to as}} Babinski-Fröhlich syndrome, named in conjunction with Joseph Babinski, who gave an independent description of the disease a year earlier in 1900.|$|E
50|$|The {{pituitary}} gland (or <b>hypophysis)</b> is an endocrine gland {{about the size}} of a pea and weighing 0.5 g in humans. It is a protrusion off the bottom of the hypothalamus at the base of the brain, and rests in a small, bony cavity (sella turcica) covered by a dural fold (diaphragma sellae). The pituitary is functionally connected to the hypothalamus by the median eminence via a small tube called the infundibular stem or pituitary stalk. The anterior pituitary (adenohypophysis) is connected to the hypothalamus via the hypothalamo-hypophyseal portal vessels, which allows for quicker and more efficient communication between the hypothalamus and the pituitary.|$|E
5000|$|The {{pituitary}} gland or <b>hypophysis</b> {{is often referred}} to as the [...] "master gland" [...] of the human body. Part of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, it controls most of the body's endocrine functions via the secretion of various hormones into the circulatory system. The {{pituitary gland}} is located below the brain in a depression (fossa) of the sphenoid bone known as the sella turcica. Although anatomically and functionally connected to the brain, the pituitary gland sits outside the blood-brain barrier. It is separated from the subarachnoid space by the diaphragma sella, therefore the arachnoid mater and thus cerebral spinal fluid cannot enter the sella turcica.|$|E
50|$|In 1937, {{influenced}} {{by the work of}} the neurosurgeon Harvey Williams Cushing, Niehans first used cerebral cells, from the hypothalamus and the <b>hypophysis.</b> Beginning in 1948, he also used liver, pancreas, kidney, heart, duodenum, thymus, and spleen cells. In 1949, he began to use lyophilized (freeze-dried) cells, not only fresh ones. In 1953, Paul Niehans treated Pope Pius XII, who in gratitude appointed him member of the Papal Academy of Sciences. In the United States, it is not legally available because of safety concerns and lack of proof of its effectiveness. In 1954, Niehans' work, Die Zellulartherapie (Cellular Therapy) was published in German. Swiss publisher Thoune released the English version and update of Niehans' original work which also included papers by researchers from Germany.|$|E
