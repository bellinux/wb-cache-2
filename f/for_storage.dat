5|$|After {{the sale}} the {{building}} was mainly used <b>for</b> <b>storage</b> whilst planning applications to convert it into a hotel were made in 1986, 1993, and 2001, {{with varying degrees of}} success. The coroner's court was the last to vacate the premises, in 1998. In 2001, {{the building was}} placed on English Heritage's Buildings at Risk Register. By 2004 it was in steep decline, and momentum was building for the fire station's owner, Britannia Hotels, to act.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Bockscar {{returned}} to the United States in November 1945 and served with the 509th at Roswell Army Air Field, New Mexico. It was nominally assigned to the Operation Crossroads task force, {{but there are no}} records indicating that it deployed for the tests. In August 1946, it was assigned to the 4105th Army Air Force Unit at Davis-Monthan Army Air Field, Arizona, <b>for</b> <b>storage.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Read/write storage or mutable storage : Allows {{information}} to be overwritten at any time.

50|$|Commercial records {{centers are}} {{facilities}} which provide services <b>for</b> the <b>storage</b> <b>for</b> paper records for organizations.

Commercial records centers provide high density <b>storage</b> <b>for</b> paper records and some offer climate controlled <b>storage</b> <b>for</b> sensitive non-paper and critical (vital) paper media. There is a trade organization for commercial records centers (for example, PRISM International), however, not all service providers are members.|$|R

5|$|At the Port of San Francisco, Steilberg {{inspected}} each {{shipment of}} stones, several thousand crates in all. The Haslett warehouse, between Fisherman's Wharf and the Hyde Street Pier, was used <b>for</b> <b>storage.</b> With groundbreaking set for July 1931 {{and the last}} freighter carrying stones still in transit, Hearst stopped his grand plan for Wyntoon because his fortunes were too far reduced from the Great Depression. The stones stayed in the warehouse, incurring annual storage fees of $15,000 in 1930s dollars.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the house, which has a full basement, the museum uses a separate building as a gallery. That building, the Northwest Gallery, was formerly used <b>for</b> <b>storage</b> and as a shop, but looks similar to the Rice House. This gallery focuses on items from Oregon, Idaho, and Washington, and includes collections of agates, thundereggs, zeolites, and placer gold, among others.|$|E

5|$|Once {{they have}} {{collected}} nectar and pollen, female workers {{return to the}} nest and deposit the harvest into brood cells, or into wax cells <b>for</b> <b>storage.</b> Unlike honeybees, bumblebees only store a few days' worth of food, so are much more vulnerable to food shortages. Male bumblebees collect only nectar and do so to feed themselves. They may visit quite different flowers from the workers because of their different nutritional needs.|$|E

The pavilions {{from the end of the}} pier were taken ashore in 1982 <b>for</b> <b>storage</b> in anticipation of eventual restoration; insufficient funds were available to complete restoration and the first stage was to open the Toll House as an exhibition centre in 1984.|$|E

5|$|The Tzotzil Maya of {{highland}} Chiapas used spears, thrown rocks, {{bows and}} arrows, and large flexible cotton shields that protected the warrior {{from head to}} foot and could be rolled up <b>for</b> <b>storage.</b> Towns were sometimes defended with walls and barricades, built from packed earth and stone, and reinforced with tree trunks. Defenders would hurl stones down from above, or pour boiling water mixed with lime and ashes upon attackers. As the Spanish became established in Chiapas, indigenous resistance took the form of flight to inaccessible regions.|$|E
