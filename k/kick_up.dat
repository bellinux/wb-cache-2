5|$|The work {{performed}} by breaker boys was hazardous. Breaker boys {{were forced to}} work without gloves {{so that they could}} better handle the slick coal. The slate, however, was sharp, and breaker boys would often leave work with their fingers cut and bleeding. Breaker boys sometimes also had their fingers amputated by the rapidly moving conveyor belts. Others lost feet, hands, arms, and legs as they moved among the machinery and became caught under conveyor belts or in gears. Many were crushed to death, their bodies retrieved from the gears of the machinery by supervisors only {{at the end of the}} working day. Others were caught in the rush of coal, and crushed to death or smothered. Dry coal would <b>kick</b> <b>up</b> so much dust that breaker boys sometimes wore lamps on their heads to see, and asthma and black lung disease were common. Coal was often washed to remove impurities, which created sulfuric acid. The acid burned the hands of the breaker boys.|$|E

In a 2002 newspaper article, Mayall said that Mayer had since forgiven him.|$|E

25|$|After her {{breakthrough}} award-winning {{performance at}} the Royal Court Theatre in the improvised play Four in a Million, the BBC offered Ullman her own show. She was quickly cast in A <b>Kick</b> <b>Up</b> the Eighties and Three of a Kind. becoming the first British woman to be offered her own sketch comedy show. Her performance earned her a BAFTA award in 1984. She became a household name with the British media affectionately dubbing her 'Our Trace.' In 1983, she started a successful (and brief) music career, which extended itself across the pond in the United States. In 1985, she teamed with comedians Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders in the sitcom Girls on Top. Ullman's husband, Allan McKeown, a successful television producer, convinced her to take a gamble on a career in America. After turning down due to creative differences, she teamed with famed television and film producer James L. Brooks who had {{a deal with the}} yet-to-be launched Fox network. They created and launched a sketch comedy vehicle The Tracey Ullman Show in 1987. Ullman received critical acclaim and was rewarded with a slew of accolades. The show would go on to win the Fox network's first Emmy award. The Tracey Ullman Show, while American-based, included Ullman's British sensibility with a variety of British characters created for her to play alongside American. Cartoon bumpers, The Simpsons were featured in the show.|$|E

In October 2006, recording started at Tottenham House in Marlborough, Wiltshire, a country house scouted by Godrich where Radiohead worked for three weeks. The band members lived in caravans, as {{the building was}} in a state of disrepair; Yorke described it as [...] "derelict in the stricter sense of the word, where there's holes in the floor, rain coming through the ceilings, half the window panes missing ... There were places you just basically didn't go. It definitely had an effect. It had some pretty strange vibes."

500|$|Sutton was {{diagnosed}} with stage 3B colorectal cancer {{at the age of}} 15, and subsequently went through aggressive radiation and chemotherapy treatments. He was declared cancer-free, but a tumour returned behind his knee, which was treated by further chemotherapy. Doctors considered an amputation of Sutton's left leg, but the tumour had already spread to other parts of his lower body. In December 2012, two years after the initial diagnosis, the cancer was deemed incurable after spreading to the lungs and liver. Sutton did not ask how long he was expected to survive, choosing to measure his life in the difference he could make, rather than in time. On 24 January 2014, in a speech at London's O2 Arena, he called his first diagnosis [...] "a good thing. It was a huge <b>kick</b> <b>up</b> the backside, it taught me to take nothing for granted, and gave me a lot of motivation for life".|$|E
500|$|Ain't Life Grand was {{released}} on October 20, 2000 through Koch with [...] "Mean Bone" [...] released as the first single. The album did not sell {{as well as its}} predecessor, and critical reception to it was mixed. Entertainment Weekly reviewer Tony Scherman stated that [...] "Slash's playing is as flashily incendiary as ever, but the songs and arrangements recycle hard-rock cliches worthier of Ratt than of a bona fide guitar god". Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone noted that [...] "great guitarists need great bands, and the Snakepit dudes are barely functional backup peons". Steve Huey of Allmusic noted that [...] "the new Snakepit does <b>kick</b> <b>up</b> a lot of noise as the album rushes by, and the strong chemistry between the members is immediately obvious". However, he stated that songwriting was the main problem, and that [...] "it never rises above the level of solid, and too many tracks are by-the-numbers hard rock at best (and pedestrian at worst)". The band were dropped by Koch two months following the album's release.|$|E
500|$|Tim Robey of The Daily Telegraph {{called the}} film [...] "a tolerably enjoyable Brett Ratner movie", {{labeling}} it [...] "brash, forgettable fun."

[...] The Hollywood Reporter Todd McCarthy said that the film is [...] "snappy, well cast and streetwise" [...] but felt that it ignored the [...] "contemporary economic issues at its core." [...] McCarthy said that Murphy's performance was a return to form as [...] "the rude, confrontational, wiseass Murphy audiences have nearly forgotten after all the silly kid comedies and heavy-makeup outings of recent years," [...] and said that with his introduction [...] "the film's energy and amusement level <b>kick</b> <b>up</b> a few notches," [...] but that the enjoyment ebbs during the actual break-in, in which [...] "Murphy becomes neutered...and the logistics of the heist become too far-fetched and laborious." ...|$|E

[...] Liverpool manager Roy Evans praised the performance of McManaman stating: [...] "The two goals were fantastic.

500|$|... 2001: A Space Odyssey is now {{considered}} one of the major artistic works of the 20th century, with many critics and filmmakers considering it Kubrick's masterpiece. Director Martin Scorsese has listed it as one of his favourite films of all time. In the 1980s, critic David Denby compared Kubrick to the monolith from 2001: A Space Odyssey, calling him [...] "a force of supernatural intelligence, appearing at great intervals amid high-pitched shrieks, who gives the world a violent <b>kick</b> <b>up</b> the next rung of the evolutionary ladder". Poet and critic Dan Schneider wrote that 2001: A Space Odyssey [...] "has one of the greatest screenplays ever penned", countering accusations of the film's coldness by saying, [...] "I recall the HAL ‘death scene’ {{as one of the few}} filmic moments to ever cause me to tear up in sadness. [...] And, in the intervening years, I have, in film talks, found that the same scene caused the same emotional reaction in many other viewers. I was not alone.

[...] Blood noted that Hunter is [...] "willing to ignore {{the rules and regulations}} to get the right thing done. Sometimes, Bobbi needs that <b>kick</b> <b>up</b> the backside to send her in that direction. By the same token, Hunter needs Bobbi's rationale sometimes to make sure he doesn't get in trouble again." [...] Bell added that for Hunter, [...] "laws are kind of suggestions, and if he’s with them he’ll follow them, and he’s always been much more a loyalist to the guy in the trenches than to any ideology". Palicki remarked that the differences in the character's views and beliefs would be [...] "a big through line throughout the entire show", and that having Morse and Hunter work for Fortune would test both of their morals, with Hunter having [...] "a bit more experience with that, where the line to cross is a bit fluid. It might take Bobbi a bit more to adapt to that." ...|$|E

He signed the contract within days, saying {{it was time to}} [...] "finish the job I started". Upon hearing the news, star defender Gareth Owen reversed his decision to leave the club, and promptly signed a two-year deal as player-coach. In a shock move Adams announced that he intended to take up a directorship at the club as the club's constitution stipulated that a minimum of four directors were needed before any playing contracts could be completed. His first signings of the season were former Glenn Hoddle Academy youngsters Ryan Burge and Ben Williamson. He followed this by tying Gary Roberts to the club for another season, and signing Walsall centre-half Clayton McDonald, left-back Mike Green, and Sheffield United teenagers Kingsley James and Phil Roe. Days {{before the start of the}} season he let Justin Richards leave on a free transfer to Burton Albion, and replaced him with Rotherham United striker Tom Pope, also a free transfer signing. After his team started the campaign with a glut of goals – both scoring and conceding – Adams decided to give his players [...] "a <b>kick</b> <b>up</b> the backside" [...] by signing experienced defenders Liam Chilvers (on loan) and Robert Kozluk. He stepped down as a director on 5 November, the day of his 100th game in charge at Port Vale, after former director Stan Meigh withdrew the £50,000 sponsorship he had provided to keep Adams on the board of directors.|$|E
