5|$|Between 2 and 4 {{grams of}} zinc are {{distributed}} throughout the <b>human</b> <b>body.</b> Most zinc is in the brain, muscle, bones, kidney, and liver, with the highest concentrations in the prostate {{and parts of the}} eye. Semen is particularly rich in zinc, a key factor in prostate gland function and reproductive organ growth.|$|E
5|$|Coenzymes {{are usually}} {{continuously}} regenerated and their concentrations maintained {{at a steady}} level inside the cell. For example, NADPH is regenerated through the pentose phosphate pathway and S-adenosylmethionine by methionine adenosyltransferase. This continuous regeneration means that small amounts of coenzymes can be used very intensively. For example, the <b>human</b> <b>body</b> turns over its own weight in ATP each day.|$|E
5|$|Gargi {{inquires}} {{in chapter}} 4 {{about the nature}} of Nadis, the <b>human</b> <b>body</b> and how vital airs function in it. Yajnavalkya begins his reply by asserting that the height of every adult human being is about 96 times the width of his or her Angula (thumb).|$|E

5|$|Leonardo {{started his}} {{study in the}} anatomy of the <b>human</b> <b>body</b> under the {{apprenticeship}} of Andrea del Verrocchio, who demanded that his students develop a deep knowledge of the subject. As an artist, he quickly became master of topographic anatomy, drawing many studies of muscles, tendons and other visible anatomical features.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium in {{the body}} tends to {{accumulate}} in the kidneys and bones. The maximum safe dose of protactinium in the <b>human</b> <b>body</b> is 0.03 µCi that corresponds to 0.5 micrograms of 231Pa. This isotope, which might {{be present in the}} air as aerosol, is 2.5 times more toxic than hydrocyanic acid.|$|E

5|$|The book {{is divided}} into five volumes. Dioscorides {{organized}} the substances by certain similarities, such as their being aromatic, or vines; these divisions do not correspond to any modern classification.

5|$|The {{history of}} anatomy is {{characterized}} by a progressive understanding of the functions of the organs and structures of the <b>human</b> <b>body.</b> Methods have also improved dramatically, advancing from the examination of animals by dissection of carcasses and cadavers (corpses) to 20th century medical imaging techniques including X-ray, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging.|$|E
5|$|The <b>human</b> <b>body</b> {{contains}} about 12mg of manganese, {{mostly in the}} bones. The soft tissue remainder is concentrated in the liver and kidneys. In the human brain, the manganese is bound to manganese metalloproteins, most notably glutamine synthetase in astrocytes.|$|E
40|$|Various joint {{positions}} of the upper extremity were used to study the tensile forces on the median nerve. To analyse the effect of embalmment, tensile forces were measured in situ in unembalmed and embalmed <b>human</b> <b>bodies.</b> A positive correlation was found between tensile force data from unembalmed and embalmed nerves. This finding justifies, for comparative studies, the use of embalmed <b>human</b> <b>bodies,</b> although the absolute tensile forces are higher...|$|R
40|$|Ambiguous <b>human</b> <b>bodies</b> {{performing}} unimanual/unipedal {{actions are}} perceived more frequently as right-handed/footed rather than left-handed/footed, which suggests a perceptual and attentional bias toward {{the right side}} of others’ body. A bias toward the right arm of <b>human</b> <b>bodies</b> could be adaptive in social life, most social interactions occurring with right-handed individuals, and the implicit knowledge that the dominant hand of humans is usually placed on their right side might also be included in body configural information. Given that inversion disrupts configural processing for <b>human</b> <b>bodies,</b> we investigated whether inversion reduces the bias toward {{the right side of}} <b>human</b> <b>bodies.</b> Consistent with our hypothesis, when presented with ambiguous stimuli depicting humans performing lateralized actions or movements, participants perceived a greater proportion of right-handed figures when the stimuli were shown upright than when the stimuli were shown inverted. The present findings seem to confirm our hypothesis that body configural information may include some form of knowledge about the probable handedness of other individuals, although alternative accounts involving the role of experience cannot be ruled out...|$|R

This louse can transmit certain diseases while the human head louse (P. h. capitis), {{to which it}} is closely related, cannot. With their simple life history and small genomes, the pair make ideal model organisms to study the molecular mechanisms behind the transmission of pathogens and vector competence.|$|E
5|$|The {{materials}} used in making musical instruments vary greatly by culture and application. Many of the materials have special significance owing to their source or rarity. Some cultures worked substances from the <b>human</b> <b>body</b> into their instruments. In ancient Mexico, for example, the material drums were made from might contain actual <b>human</b> <b>body</b> parts obtained from sacrificial offerings. In New Guinea, drum makers would mix human blood into the adhesive used to attach the membrane. Mulberry trees are held in high regard in China owing to their mythological significance—instrument makers would hence use them to make zithers. The Yakuts believe that making drums from trees struck by lightning gives them a special connection to nature.|$|E
