40|$|Whether honeybees utilise {{oilseed rape}} (Brassica napus), and thus {{come into contact}} with {{neonicotinoid}} pesticides, has been questioned in the UK. Here we report the melissopalynology of honey samples taken from hives in the northeast of the UK from 2014 to 2015. The results show that Brassica pollen is predominant in <b>honey</b> <b>extractions</b> from June, following the mass bloom of oilseed rape. <b>Honey</b> <b>extractions</b> from July and September show more diverse sources of nectar from entomophilous crops, weeds and garden plants.

40|$|Chemical {{analysis}} of Asphodelus microcarpus Salzm. et Viv. honey {{is of great}} importance, since melissopalynology does not allow the unambiguous determination of its botanical origin. Therefore, the volatile compounds of eight unifloral asphodel honeys have been investigated for the first time. The honey extracts were obtained by headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and ultrasonic solvent extraction (USE) and analyzed by GC and GC/MS. In the honey headspace, 31 volatile compounds were identified with high percentages of 2 -phenylacetaldehyde (2; 14. 8 - 34. 7 %), followed by somewhat lower percentages of methyl syringate (1; 10. 5 - 11. 5 %). Compound 2 is not a specific marker of the botanical origin of the honey, but its high percentage can be emphasized as headspace characteristic of asphodel <b>honey.</b> The <b>extraction</b> solvent for all the samples was selected after extracting a representative sample with pentane, Et 2 O, pentane/Et 2 O 1 : 2 (v/v), and CH 2 Cl 2.

40|$|The {{factors that}} affect honey quality in Uganda were {{surveyed}} in 120 beekeeping households. Honey was sampled from supermarkets, hawkers and stall markets along four transects across Kampala, the capital. Honey quality parameters assessed were diastase number (DN), free acidity (FA), moisture content (MC), hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), and water insoluble solids (WIS). Honey was mostly harvested from basket and grass hives. Pressing, boiling and straining were popular honey processing methods. Honey quality was mainly compromised by harvesting immature <b>honey,</b> bad <b>extraction</b> methods and contamination by extraneous materials. Constraints to beekeeping were lack of appropriate equipment (52 %), inadequate farmer skills, bad weather and vermin. Honey brands differed (P< 0. 05) in DN, most failed the Uganda and Codex Alimentarius standards, and 20 % met European Union HMF and DN standards. Correlation was observed between HMF vs. DN (r= 0. 94); MC vs. FA (r= 0. 56). Supermarket honey (4. 65) was more superior (P< 0. 05) in DN than stall markets (1. 93), and hawkers (2. 3). Similarly, WIS levels differed (P< 0. 05) between honeys from supermarkets (0. 08), stall markets (3. 0) and hawkers (3. 15). All honeys met MC standards, while DN and WIS were major shortcomings.

40|$|A {{fast and}} {{straightforward}} generic procedure for the simultaneous extraction of various classes of pesticides, mycotoxins, plant toxins, and veterinary drugs in various matrixes has been developed, for subsequent analysis by liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection. As a first step, four existing multianalyte procedures and three newly proposed methods were compared {{for a test}} set of 172 pesticides, mycotoxins, and plant toxins spiked to a feed matrix. The new procedures, which basically involved extraction/dilution of the sample with water and an acidified organic solvent (methanol, acetonitrile, or acetone), were most promising. The three new generic extraction methods were further tested for applicability to other matrixes (maize, honey, milk, egg, meat). Overall, the best recoveries were obtained for acetone, followed by acetonitrile. With respect to matrix effects, acetonitrile was the most favorable solvent and methanol was the worst. The occurrence of matrix effects decreased for the matrixes {{in the order of}} feed > maize > meat > milk > egg > <b>honey.</b> The <b>extraction</b> method selected as the default procedure (water/acetonitrile/ 1 % formic acid) was also evaluated for applicability to multiple classes of veterinary drugs in all six matrixes, with satisfactory results.

The 1 H NMR spectra of chloroform extracts acquired with a fast and new pulse sequence were used to characterize and differentiate by chemometric analysis 118 honey samples of four different botanical origins (chestnut, acacia, linden, and polyfloral). The spectra collection, processing, and analysis require only 30 min. The 1 H spectrum provides a fingerprint for each honey type, showing many characteristic peaks in all spectral regions. Principal component analysis (PCA) and projection to latent structures by partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were performed on selected signals of the spectra to discriminate the different botanical types and to identify characteristic metabolites for each honey type. A distinct discrimination among samples was achieved. According to the distance to model criterion, there was no overlap between the four models, which proved to be specific for each honey type.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Beekeeping or {{apiculture}} is {{the preservation}} of honey bee colonies to get pure honey and helps in pollination. Beekeeping is a useful mean of strengthening livelihoods because it creates a variety of assets. The main focus {{of the study was}} to assess the impact of beekeeping training given by Society of facilitator and Trainer (SOFT) to females in Sargodha and Chakwal district. Capacity building of rural women in beekeeping was the focus and fifteen trainees ’ beekeepers were selected randomly from each district for survey to assess the impact of beekeeping in their livelihood. The analysis suggests that there are some social and cultural barriers which restrict women to go out in the fields for the management practices of beekeeping. For future selection criteria of participants have to be focused and without the involvement of male member they can’t manage this whole activity in a better way. For young females it was very difficult to handle bees, proper colonies management, their supplement feeding, <b>honey</b> <b>extraction,</b> movement of hives etc. Economically, beekeeping increased keepers ’ income but this ratio was very low in the targeted area.

40|$|Abstract: Ozone is {{a strong}} oxidizer, and we {{evaluated}} its potential to eliminate pesticides from honeycomb and empty honey bee hives. Honey bees are exposed to pesticides when foraging for nectar and pollen and when beekeepers use in-hive chemical pest control measures. Persistent pesticides can accumulate in the hive over years, potentially harming the bees. Honeycomb is removed from bee colonies for <b>honey</b> <b>extraction</b> and then placed back on the colonies at a later date, providing a time when combs could be fumigated to eliminate or reduce pesticide residues. We found that ozone gas at a rate> 920 mg O 3 /m 3 for 10 - 20 h lowers coumaphos residues on a glass surface by 93 - 100 % and tau-fluvalinate by 75 - 98 %. Ozone was less effective at eliminating pesticides on beeswax, and residues were more effectively eliminated with new combs (comb built by bees within 3 y) than with old combs (combs used by beekeepers for> 10 y). Ozone significantly reduced dimethylphenyl formamide, chlorpyrifos, and fenpyroximate contaminations in comb. When comb is treated with ozone, an off-odor is created, but the volatiles {{were found to be}} primarily straight chain aldehydes and carboxylic acids that are probably harmless to bees and humans.

The use of Tualang honey is a possible approach for keloid treatment. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the antiproliferative effect of methanolic extraction of Tualang honey to primary human keloid fibroblasts and to identify the volatile compounds in methanol extraction of Tualang honey. Methods Crude Tualang honey was extracted with methanol and then dried using rota vapor to remove remaining methanol from honey. Normal and keloid fibroblasts were verified and treated with the extracted honey. Cell proliferation was tested with [3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yi) - 5 -(3 -carboxymethoxyphenyl) - 2 -(4 -sulfophenyl) - 2 H-tetrazolium, inner salt] (MTS) assay. Extraction of Tualang honey using methanol was carried out and the extracted samples were analysed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The result was analysed using SPSS and tested with Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests. Results Methanolic extraction of honey has positive anti proliferative effect on keloid fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner. The presence of fatty acids such as palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid and octadecanoic acid may contribute to the anti-proliferative effect in keloid fibroblasts.

40|$|To {{estimate}} {{the relationship between}} honey yield {{and some of the}} morphological characters, five queen-daughters from each of 30 queen-mothers were studied. The queen-mothers were selected randomly from the apiary of Research Center of Animal Science and Natural Resources in Isfahan Province. Summer honey yield was measured from the difference of honey comb before and after <b>honey</b> <b>extraction</b> while fall honey production was calculated from area of sealed honey combs. Morphological characters were recorded using a stereodissecting microscope fitted with a calibrated micrometer reticule according to Ruttner’s procedures. The mean of honey yield for a year was estimated to be 10. 05 kg. Phenotypic correlations between yearly honey production and summer and fall honey productions were estimated to be 0. 49 and 0. 88, respectively, while the correlation between summer and fall honey yields was low (0. 019). There were significant correlations between summer honey yield with cubital-b index, tibia length and forewing width (0. 28, 0. 27 and 0. 25, respectively). Also there were significant correlations between metatarus width with total and fall honey yields (0. 22 and 0. 23, respectively). Genetic correlations between metatarus length and cubital index with summer honey yield were negative (- 0. 75 and - 0. 45, respectively). It may be concluded that due to the high correlation between summer honey production and total honey yield, one could improve yearly honey production by selecting on the basis of summer yield of colonies. Among morphological traits, metatarus length, forewing width and cubital index could be used in the breeding plan in order to increase honey yield...|$|E

The Enawene-Nawe are an Aruak speaking people, indigenous to the Meridian Amazon. Specifically, {{they live in}} the Jurema River hydrological basin, located in the northwestern region of the Mato Grosso state. Methods The stingless bees were sampled from two ecologically similar regions in the interior of Enawene-Nawe Land. The first sampling took place around the village, i. e., adjacent to houses, by the edge of the Iquê River, next to food leftovers, around human excrement, and simply when the insects were found flying or reposing on a human body. The second round of sampling happened from 29 / 10 to 02 / 11 / 94, during an expedition for honey collection that took place throughout the ciliar bushes of the Papagaio River, an important tributary of Juruena River. We sampled bees adjacent to their nests following the beehive inspection or during the <b>honey</b> <b>extraction.</b> In this work, the main bee species of the sub tribe Meliponina, which were handled by the Enawene-Nawe, was identified, and a brief ethnographic description of the honey collection expeditions and its social-cosmologic meaning for the group was done. Results and Discussion Similar to other indigenous people in Brazil, the Enawene-Nawe recognized 48 stingless bee species. They identified each bee species by name and specified each one's ecological niche. A brief ethnographic description of the honey collection expeditions and bees' social-cosmologic meaning for the group is included.

The study of pollen and nectar gathering of a social bee colony may be observed from various standpoints, considering the collecting bee as a representative of colony necessities, its pollinating functions through {{the quantity and quality of}} pollen and nectar collected and identifying, through the pollen, the vegetal species visited. While the production and concentration of nectar may present considerable fluctuations as a result of subtle weather changes such as wind, temperature, relative humidity, nebulosity, soil humidity, etc., the pollen is brought out only once by flowers and may have only half its protein mass. The social bees of the Melipona genus, of more than 40 species, are all neotropical and are distributed throughout the Amazon. Its size is relatively large and its breeding is associated with <b>honey</b> <b>extraction,</b> a constant activity in rural populations. These bees gather throughout the year and, regarding their polytrophic nature, seem to prefer visiting plants of the Leguminosae, Solanaceae, Myrtaceae and Melastomataceae families in southeastern Brazil, (Ramalho 1990, Wilms, 1995). In this context it has been emphasized that these bees, due to their greater size, carry out ‘buzz-pollination’. It is known that they visit species of pollinia pollen grain plants, such as the Brazilian rain forest orchid Maxillaria parviflora aff (Cortopassi-Laurino, unpublished data), which makes them appropriate in these gatherings. This study was done with the purpose of obtaining information about the dynamics of the seasonal gathering, considering some meteorological parameters in which the bees carry out their activities and the diversity and quantity of material gathered. Since the dry season is of vast flowering, what would be the dynamics of gathering of Melipona bees on both the rainy and dry seasons in the same region...|$|E
40|$|Beekeeping has a {{long history}} in Bure {{district}} as in other parts of Ethiopia. On average, it is estimated that 110 tons of honey are produced annually by smallholder farmers, and approximately 5000 households (hhs) are engaged in beekeeping as a sideline income generating activity, including landless farmers. Most beekeepers use local hives and beekeeping practices. Consequently, {{the quantity and quality of}} honey produced in the district was very low. The Office of Agriculture and Rural Development (OoARD) in Bure and the Regional BoARD started addressing these problems in 2004 through a campaign style distribution of modern hives and processing equipments. In 2007, the Improving Productivity and Market Success (IPMS) of Ethiopian Farmers project in collaboration with the district OoARD introduced a participatory market oriented value chain development approach in which stakeholders identified problems/potentials and possible interventions in production, input supply/credit, marketing and extension approaches/activities. Major problems were the low occupancy rate (23 %) of the newly introduced modern hives, partly as a result of lack of knowledge and skills; lack of market price information and linkages for honey produced from modern hives as well as lack of price incentive for quality honey. Furthermore, private sector involvement in the supply of inputs was minimal. Stakeholders started addressing these problems and the objective of this case study is to review and document results and lessons generated from these interventions. Beekeepers multiplied 198 bee colonies, planted improved bee forages in the backyards, purchased smokers and protective clothing from input suppliers and collectively sold over 15 tons honey to honey traders and consumers in Addis Ababa. Beekeepers who adopted/benefited from the various interventions, earned on average Birr 2374 /annum, as compared to Birr 201 for beekeepers who did not adopt/benefit. Statistics from the OoARD also suggest that the occupancy rate of modern hives doubled over the past two years because of improved management. In addition, the beekeeping knowledge and skill of farmers have been improving. Still the average yield from modern hives is still well below its potential and requires further attention. While the overall honey production in the district increases and has attracted the interest of commercial investors, linkages with the clean honey market need to be strengthened to reap the full benefits. The commercial processing (<b>honey</b> <b>extraction)</b> also requires further attention by either cooperatives and/or private processors. Canadian International Development Agenc...|$|E
40|$|Harvesting, <b>honey</b> <b>extraction</b> and {{packaging}} Cue: As a food {{that is often}} eaten raw, the purity of honey {{is one of its}} most important characteristics. But honey is also a product that can easily be contaminated. Even storing honey in the wrong type of container can damage its flavour, and beekeepers must take care at every stage of harvesting and handling honey to ensure that contamination is avoided. For beekeepers who sell their own honey, having a clean product that buyers can trust is the cornerstone of their marketing strategy. And for those who sell to processors, if their honey is less than pure it will simply be rejected. Daniel Ball is the managing director of Forest Fruits, a company that buys honey from several thousand beekeepers in Zambia?s North-Western province. The beekeepers come from Mwinilunga, an area at the source of the Zambezi river. Forest Fruits not only buys honey from the beekeepers, but also provides training and some equipment. Daniel spoke to Chris Kakunta about the importance of hygiene in the production of top quality honey, much of which he exports to Europe and America. Chris asked him how beekeepers can protect the purity of their honey during the harvesting process. IN:		?The first thing farmers have to do is ? OUT:		?have confidence in your product. ? DUR?N:	 5 ? 51 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Daniel Ball, of the Zambian company Forest Fruits, which buys top quality honey from small scale beekeepers for export to Europe and America. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Ball	The first thing farmers {{have to do is to}} make sure they are prepared. When they are harvesting their beehives, it doesn?t matter what kind of beehive they are using; they must start by having the right equipment. Even if it is very basic equipment that is OK, but you need to have the right equipment so you need to plan for it. Kakunta	When you say basic equipment what are you referring to? Ball	Well, when you are harvesting honey you need to have buckets, containers that you can put the honey into, and those containers must not be metal, because honey takes on the taste of the metal, and that affects the taste. Therefore for the people who buy it, it is not that you can?t eat it, but it will not taste as nice. So you need a plastic bucket or a wooden bucket, but you should not have a metal bucket. And then of course the bucket should be clean, and it should have a lid, a top, that can seal against the moisture. Because honey sucks in water from the air, and if it sucks in water from the air eventually it can ferment. So you need a top or a lid that will seal against moisture in the air. And then besides a bucket, you probably need a sharp knife that is also clean. And then, in order to maintain your quality, most beekeepers should probably have a veil to protect their face. Now in our company, in Forest Fruits, we deal with about 6000 beekeepers, and when we started as a company we didn?t have money to give veils to beekeepers and we saw that that affected the quality. Once we had a bit of money we bought materials, made veils for our beekeepers, and we noticed that that changed the quality immediately. When people?s eyes and nose and face is protected, then they are willing to stay with the bees longer. So you need some protective equipment. At the very minimum you need a veil to protect your face. If you can get some gloves, that is also good. If you have those things you will stay longer with your bees, and you?ll be able to work with the honey a bit more. Kakunta	In short, you are trying to say that while working with the bees you must exercise a little bit of patience? Ball	Very much. You can?t rush in and rush out. If you rush in, your quality will be affected. And if you are looking to find a good market beyond the village, then definitely you must take time to take care of your product, not just your product, but also your bees. Kakunta	Apart from a metal container, what are some of the things that you consider as contaminating factors? Ball	Well if you have a bucket and you have been using it for fertiliser, that will contaminate your honey. So fertiliser is one thing. If you have been carrying diesel or oil or petrol or any chemicals in that container, you should never use it for food, because it will definitely be contaminated. Kakunta	Once you have harvested your honey, there comes now the issue of extracting. During this process do you foresee any contamination as well? Ball	Yes, in extraction you also have to be careful. If you are extracting in the village then you must be careful. If it?s raining or it?s in the rainy season then you must extract quickly, otherwise the honey will suck up moisture from the air and that will cause it to ferment. Also, in the village if you are processing you must be careful that you don?t have too much smoke. Now when you are harvesting you use some smoke; you should use just a little bit of smoke. If you use too much that smoke can be tasted in the honey. And then when you are processing in the village, if you are processing under the, what we call the chota here in Zambia, which is the small thatched building, and if you have a fire in there, the smoke will be going into the honey. So you must be careful there that the smoke doesn?t go into the honey. Remember that honey should taste like the flowers that the bees take it from, and every beekeeper can tell you that, yes, this is good honey, because it actually tastes like the flowers, and it smells like the flowers. If the quality is affected by poor processing or poor extraction in the village, then definitely the taste and the smell is going to change. Kakunta	Sometimes there is also the issue of filtering or straining the honey to remove any impurities. What type of materials do you recommend for beekeepers to use? Ball	Well you can use simple things like mosquito gauze. If you are selling a finished product in the village, then definitely straining it is important. But if you are selling it to a larger processor, then straining it is not so important. It just depends how you are going to sell it. But if you are going to strain it then mosquito gauze is OK. Kakunta	What type of conditions do you need to package your honey? Ball	Well as I mentioned before, one of the most important things with honey is that you make sure that you package it in a container that you can seal. If it?s got plenty of holes in it, or it is allowing the moisture or the air in, that?s going to affect the quality. Remember, honey sucks up moisture from the air, and that is an enemy of honey. Kakunta	How important is the issue of labelling? Ball	Anyone who buys it will want to know when it was harvested. What we do with our farmers is, it is labelled with their name and the name of the village and the date that it was harvested, and that is enough. Once that label is on there we know what to do with it as a processor, as a packer. But a small beekeeper, if you have the date that it was harvested, your name and your village, then people are going to have confidence in your product. End of track. Careful harvesting of honey using the right equipment, plus extraction, filtering {{and packaging}} of honey...|$|E
