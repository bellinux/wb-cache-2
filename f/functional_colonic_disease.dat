25|$|Diseases {{that affect}} the large {{intestine}} may affect it {{in whole or in}} part. Appendicitis is one such disease, caused by inflammation of the appendix. Generalised inflammation of the large intestine is referred to as colitis, which when caused be the bacteria Clostridium difficile is referred to as pseudomembranous colitis. Diverticulitis is a common cause of abdominal pain resulting from outpouchings that particularly affects the colon. <b>Functional</b> <b>colonic</b> <b>diseases</b> refer to disorders without a known cause, and include irritable bowel syndrome and intestinal pseudoobstruction. Constipation may result from lifestyle factors, impaction of a rigid stool in the rectum, or in neonates, Hirschprung's disease.|$|R

40|$|Ultrasound is an undervalued {{non-invasive}} examination in {{the diagnosis}} of <b>colonic</b> <b>diseases.</b> It {{has been replaced by}} the considerably more expensive magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography, despite the fact that, as first examination, it can usefully supplement the diagnostic process. Transabdominal ultrasound can provide quick information about bowel status and help in the choice of adequate further examinations and treatment. Ultrasonography, as a screening imaging modality in asymptomatic patients can identify several <b>colonic</b> <b>diseases</b> such as diverticulosis, inflammatory bowel disease or cancer. In addition, it is widely available, cheap, non-invasive technique without the use of ionizing radiation, therefore it is safe to use in childhood or during pregnancy, and can be repeated at any time. New ultrasound techniques such as elastography, contrast enhanced and Doppler ultrasound, mini-probes rectal and transperineal ultrasonography have broadened the indication. It gives an overview of the methodology of various ultrasound examinations, presents the morphology of normal bowel wall and the typical changes in different <b>colonic</b> <b>diseases.</b> We will pay particular attention to rectal and transperineal ultrasound because of their outstanding significance {{in the diagnosis}} of rectal and perineal disorders.

40|$|Escherichia coli strains {{isolated}} from patients with colonic disorders (n = 27) and strains {{isolated from}} the rectal mucosa of healthy subjects (n = 24) were compared with respect to expression of cell surface hydrophobicity, carriage of intestinal virulence factors, adhesion to tissue culture cells, and expression of binding of extracellular matrix proteins and plasma proteins. Strains isolated from patients with <b>colonic</b> <b>disease</b> did not express a more hydrophobic cell surface than strains from healthy subjects. Few strains from both groups carried genes encoding for recognised virulence factors of E coli. Only one strain, carrying the eae gene induced actin polymerisation in tissue culture cells. Strains from patients with <b>colonic</b> <b>diseases</b> adhered to HT 29 cells, which are of intestinal origin, to a higher extent than E coli from healthy subjects. Significantly more strains from patients with colonic disorders than E coli from healthy subjects expressed binding of fibronectin, collagens, laminin, vitronectin, plasminogen, throbospondin, and fibrinogen. Expression of binding of these proteins may influence the pathogenesis of <b>colonic</b> <b>disease</b> by mediating binding to ulcerated tissue, preventing complement induced lysis of bacteria and by exerting proteolytic activity. There was no correlation between serotype, expression of cell surface hydrophobicity, and binding of extracellular matrix and plasma proteins...|$|R

40|$|Thirty-six {{patients}} underwent orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) {{for primary}} sclerosing cholangitis under cyclosporine, azathioprine, and steroid immunosuppression. Of these patients, 29 suffered from chronic ulcerative colitis. The {{purpose of this}} study is to determine (1) whether replacement of the diseased liver and the altered immunocompetence suppresses the manifestation of chronic ulcerative colitis, and (2) if active <b>colonic</b> <b>disease</b> alters allograft function. Thirty of 36 patients survived OLT. After OLT, seven of 14 patients with symptomatic colon disease at the time of transplantation continue to suffer from active chronic ulcerative colitis, and three of 13 who were asymptomatic developed clinically active <b>disease.</b> Intractable <b>colonic</b> <b>disease</b> was the indication for post-OLT proctocolectomy in three patients, and one refused an indicated colectomy. Despite the long duration of the <b>disease,</b> none developed <b>colonic</b> malignancy. Long-term graft assessment showed good hepatocyte synthetic function in patients suffering from either active or inactive disease. Liver alkaline phosphatase, however, was significantly higher in patients suffering from active <b>colonic</b> <b>disease.</b> Furthermore, the alkaline phosphatase in symptomatic patients was higher than that seen in a matched cohort undergoing OLT for chronic active hepatitis or primary biliary cirrhosis. These results suggest that (1) liver replacement and immunosuppression in patients suffering from sclerosing cholangitis and ulcerative colitis do not alter the course of the colon disease, and (2) active chronic ulcerative colitis does not adversely affect allograft function, although elevation of alkaline phosphatase may be the harbinger of recurrence over the long term...|$|R

40|$|Digestion and {{absorption}} of lipids {{is a highly}} efficient process. From Western diets about 95 % will be absorbed. This implies that together with lipids from endogenous sources 6 - 8 g of lipids will enter the colon daily. This input significantly increases during various lipid malabsorption syndromes. It has long been assumed that the biological fate of unabsorbed lipids is physiologically not relevant. However, significant microbial lipid metabolism occurs. Circumstantial evidence is arising which supports a role of unabsorbed lipid metabolites {{in the development of}} <b>colonic</b> <b>diseases.</b> Lipid metabolites may act as detergents in the colon, leading to mucosal injury and reactive hyperproliferation, which in its turn could promote tumour development. Lipid metabolites could also be transformed in biological active metabolites, which have a tumour promoting potency.

40|$|The {{surgical}} resection {{rates among}} parous women with distal ileal and <b>colonic</b> Crohn's <b>disease</b> have been compared with resection rates among distal ileal (n = 197) and colonic (n = 332) Crohn's disease patients. Thirty of 44 parous women with distal ileal Crohn's disease and 28 of 44 with <b>colonic</b> Crohn's <b>disease</b> had achieved their first pregnancy on average 8 years and 6. 2 years respectively before {{the diagnosis of}} Crohn's disease was established. Resections for each patient were negatively correlated with parity in both groups. (Distal ileal disease (p = 0. 034, rs = 0. 3207), <b>colonic</b> <b>disease</b> (p = 0. 051, rs = - 0. 2960)). Patients with distal ileal Crohn's disease {{and a history of}} pregnancy at diagnosis (n = 30, mean follow up = 15 years) had fewer resections/patient when compared with the published resection group: mean (SD); 1. 17 (0. 65) v 1. 57 (1. 05), p = 0. 006. Patients with <b>colonic</b> Crohn's <b>disease</b> and a history of pregnancy at diagnosis (n = 28, mean follow up = 16. 5 years) had fewer resections/patient when compared with the published resection group: mean (SD); 0. 68 (0. 77) v 1. 05 (0. 77), p = 0. 019. In summary, patients with distal ileal and <b>colonic</b> Crohn's <b>disease,</b> who had been pregnant in the past subsequently need fewer surgical resections.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{seeks to}} compare the {{histopathology}} of preoperative terminal ileal and colonic resection specimens with pouch biopsies after the ileoanal pull-through (IAPT) procedure. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Pouchitis is the most frequent complication of transanal continent reservoirs in patients after IAPT. METHODS: The authors conducted 751 consecutive pouch biopsies on 73 patients with inflammatory bowel disease or familial adenomatous polyposis who underwent IAPT by a single surgeon over a 10 -year period. In this preliminary report, a pathologist, in blinded fashion, has graded 468 of the IAPT pouch biopsies and 67 of the patients' preoperative terminal ileal and colonic resection histopathology to date. Colonic histopathology was graded by the extent and severity of disease, terminal ileal and pouch histopathology by active inflammation, chronic inflammation, lymphocyte aggregates, intraepithelial lymphocytes, eosinophils, and villous blunting. RESULTS: Extent of <b>colonic</b> <b>disease</b> (gross and microscopic) {{was a significant predictor}} of active inflammation in subsequent IAPT pouch biopsy specimens. Also, the gross extent of <b>colonic</b> <b>disease</b> exhibited a significant linear association with pouch inflammation. However, the severity of <b>colonic</b> <b>disease</b> was not significantly predictive of active inflammation in subsequent IAPT pouch biopsies. Terminal ileal active and chronic inflammation were significant predictors of subsequent IAPT pouch inflammation. Although lymphocyte aggregates and intraepithelial lymphocytes were not predictive, terminal ileum eosinophils and villous blunting were significant predictors of active inflammation in subsequent IAPT pouch biopsy specimens. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative terminal ileal and colonic histopathology predicts active inflammation of pouches after IAPT. Patients who are preoperatively assessed to have extensive disease of the colon, ileal disease ("backwash ileitis"), or both appear to be at greater risk for the development of pouchitis after IAPT...|$|R

40|$|A {{total of}} 2590 {{consecutive}} patients referred for double contrast examination (DCE) {{of the large}} bowel were followed up radiographically, clinically, endoscopically, and histopathologically during a four year period.

40|$|Background—Enterotoxigenic {{strains of}} Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) have {{been implicated in}} diarrhoeal illness in {{livestock}} and children, but their role in adult human <b>colonic</b> <b>disease</b> is unknown.  Aims—To investigate responses by primary adult human colonic epithelial cells to purified B fragilis toxin (BFT).  Methods—BFT was purified from culture supernatant of a highly toxigenic strain of ETBF. Morphological changes to primary colonic epithelial cells, in response to purified BFT, were studied in organ culture of colonic biopsy specimens from 15 adults.  Results—BFT induced epithelial cell cytotoxicity in colonic biopsy specimens from 12 / 15 subjects. The BFT induced morphological changes were characterised by epithelial cell rounding, separation from adjacent cells, and detachment from the basement membrane. In severely affected specimens, almost all the epithelial cells were affected. There was heterogeneity between subjects in {{the rate at which}} BFT induced epithelial cell cytotoxicity occurred. Furthermore, in colonic biopsy specimens from three subjects, exposure to BFT did not induce any significant morphological changes to epithelial cells.  Conclusion—BFT is capable of inducing cytotoxicity in primary adult human colonic epithelial cells. Such an effect of ETBF derived BFT on epithelial cells in the colon in vivo would be expected to lead to mucosal inflammation and diarrhoea. Heterogeneity in responses by primary colonocytes probably reflects the outcome of host-BFT interactions. Such interactions in vivo could determine the occurrence of <b>colonic</b> <b>disease</b> in some individuals but not others. ...|$|R

We have examined the effect of serum fractions from patients with UC and other <b>colonic</b> <b>diseases</b> on mouse thymus to clarify the possible existence of factors which have thymus growth activity. These fractions were separated from sera of patients with UC by gel filtration and anion exchange high performance liquid chromatography. In mice given UC serum fractions; (i) remarkable increases in weight and total cell number of the thymus were observed from day 4 to day 9; (ii) a significant increase in the number of peanut agglutinin (PNA) + thymus cells was demonstrated using flow cytometry on day 9; (iii) on quantitative analysis of surface antigens the percentage of Lyt- 2 + thymus cells decreased and that of L 3 T 4 + thymus cells increased remarkably on day 13; the number of bright Thy- 1. 2 + cells and of dull Lyt- 1 + cells increased. In contrast, the serum fractions from patients with other <b>colonic</b> <b>diseases</b> and from normal persons caused little change in mouse thymus throughout the study.
