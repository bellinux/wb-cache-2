In response to this advocacy, the current quasi-experimental study was designed to examine effects of English Internet <b>extensive</b> <b>reading</b> on the development of English proficiency of Taiwanese undergraduate learners of English as a foreign language (EFL). Because positive impact of the <b>extensive</b> <b>reading</b> of books, or linear printed text, has been established relatively firmly by existing literature, the current study examined effects of the <b>extensive</b> <b>reading</b> of multimodal text against that of linear text. Fiction was the genre of reading text in the current study because it was used in all the reviewed studies of <b>extensive</b> <b>reading</b> of linear text. Guided by four hypotheses, three types of statistical analysis tests were conducted. The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) test results indicated equally significant improvement in English proficiency in the experimental groups but not significant change in motivation for reading across all three groups. The multiple regression test results suggested that the <b>extensive</b> <b>reading</b> of either linear or multimodal text predicted English proficiency. The chi-square test results did not reveal significant association between <b>extensive</b> <b>reading</b> and application of several reading strategies. The discussion involving statistical findings and contextual data provided by questionnaires and participants' assignment sheets leads to pedagogical implications and directions for future research. The pedagogical implications are incorporating <b>extensive</b> <b>reading</b> of linear and/or multimodal text into formal EFL curricula and including multimodal informational text in the program.
