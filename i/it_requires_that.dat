First, <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> <b>that</b> the perspectives and concerns of those who receive ODA be taken into account.

Secondly, <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> <b>that</b> ODA be promulgated {{in a manner consistent with}} Canadian values and foreign policy, sustainable development, and the promotion of democracy and human rights. The Bill also requires that Canadian foreign aid spending be more transparent and accountable to Parliament and must be reported in a timely manner.|$|E

One of his main arguments in Small is Beautiful is that we cannot consider the problem of technological production solved if <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> <b>that</b> we recklessly erode our finite natural capital and deprive future generations of its benefits. Schumacher's work coincided with the growth of ecological concerns and with the birth of environmentalism, and he became a hero to many in the environmental movement and community movement.|$|E
25|$|A related {{speculation}} by Sagan and Newman {{suggests that}} if other civilizations exist, and are transmitting and exploring, their signals and probes simply have not arrived yet. However, critics have noted that this is unlikely, since <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> <b>that</b> humanity's advancement has occurred at a very special point in time, while the Milky Way is in transition from empty to full. This is {{a tiny fraction of}} the lifespan of a galaxy under ordinary assumptions and calculations resulting from them, so the likelihood that we are in the midst of this transition is considered low in the paradox.|$|E
25|$|There is also {{a marked}} {{difference}} between dextromethorphan hydrobromide, contained in most cough suppressant preparations, and dextromethorphan polistirex, contained in the brand name preparation Delsym. Polistirex is a polymer that is bonded to the dextromethorphan that requires more time for the stomach to digest it as <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> <b>that</b> an ion exchange reaction take place prior to its dissolution into the blood. Because of this, dextromethorphan polistirex takes considerably longer to absorb, resulting in more gradual and longer lasting effects reminiscent of time release pills. As a cough suppressant, the polistirex version lasts up to 12 hours. This duration also holds true when used recreationally.|$|E

500|$|Churchill's {{subjects}} are often American Indian figures and other themes associated with Native American Culture. [...] He uses historical photographs as source material for works. [...] In the early 1990s at Santa Fe Indian Market, Churchill protested {{the passage of}} the 1990 Indian Arts and Crafts Act. <b>It</b> <b>requires</b> <b>that,</b> to identify and exhibit works as being by a Native American, artists and craftsmen must be enrolled in a Native American tribe or designated by a tribe as an artisan.

500|$|<b>It</b> <b>requires</b> <b>that</b> the {{defendant}} owed a {{duty of care}} to the victim (it is for the judge to decide on which facts such a duty would be created). These rules are typically those of tort. For example, in R v Pittwood, {{the defendant}} was put under a duty to act on account of being contractually obliged to close the gates at a railway crossing. Similar duties include those of a doctor of his patients, an electrician over a householder he has done work for, parents over their children, and, developed more recently, a police officer over persons he arrests. Included, however, are those of a criminal enterprise, which would not attract tortious liability in the civil law. Where the defendant is liable through an omission and not an act, then a legal duty to act – rather than a duty of care – is needed. Andrew Ashworth has criticised {{the nature of the}} duty of care requirement as [...] "decision-making at its retrospective worst".|$|E
500|$|According to *Blue Sky's records, the American {{government}} {{created an}} AI {{at the same}} time it created ARPANET in the 1970s. This AI, *Mother, in turn created child AIs, but its first attempt spread out of control and had to be destroyed by a virus that spread after it—later officially explained by the government as the real-life Creeper and Reaper worms. *Mother's later attempts, which could only exist on one system at a time, were more successful, and these AIs left the ARPANET in favor of the Internet when it was developed. *Reaper, however, continued to spread and destroyed any AI it found, such as *Emilia. The player finds *Paris, another AI and *Emilia's brother, on an ARPANET node, who explains that compiling the binary code in *Emilia's message can recreate her. The player compiles *Emilia onto their system, and the two learn of a [...] "payload" [...] that the other AIs have developed, which exploits a vulnerability that can cause *Reaper to self-terminate; however, infecting *Reaper with <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> <b>that</b> an AI be recompiled with it as living bait, meaning permanent deletion. Realizing that they have no other choice, *Emilia becomes the payload carrier. After a final conversation, the player allows *Emilia to sacrifice herself, saving the AIs and ending the game.|$|E

500|$|The ONA {{does not}} {{initiate}} members into the group itself, but rather expects {{an individual to}} initiate themselves. <b>It</b> <b>requires</b> <b>that</b> initiates be in a good physical condition, and recommends a training regimen for prospective members to follow. [...] Newcomers are expected {{to take on a}} magical partner of the opposite sex, or of the same sex if they are lesbian or gay. Thenceforth, the practitioner must undertake personal and increasingly difficult challenges in order to move through the different grades. Most of the ordeals that allow the initiate to proceed to the next stage are publicly revealed by the Order in its introductory material, as it is believed that the true initiatory element lies in the experience itself and can only be attained through performing them. For instance, part of the ritual to become an External Adept involves an ordeal in which the prospective member is to find a lonely spot and to lay there, still, for an entire night without moving or sleeping. The initiatory process for the role of Internal Adept entails the practitioner withdrawing from human society for three months, from an equinox to a solstice, or (more usually) for six months, [...] during which time they must live in the wild without modern conveniences or contact with civilisation. [...] The next stage – the Ritual of the Abyss – involves the candidate living alone in a dark isolated cavern for a lunar month. According to Jeffrey Kaplan, an academic specialist of the far right, these physically and mentally challenging initiatory tasks reflect [...] "the ONA's conception of itself as a vanguard organization composed of a tiny coterie of Nietzschean elites." ...|$|E
