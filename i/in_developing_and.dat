5|$|At Sinclair's home, Jenny {{discovers that}} he is a Nazi secret agent and knocks him out. She is later {{detained}} and forced to leave a message for Cliff to bring the rocket pack to the Griffith Observatory in exchange for her life. Just before he is arrested by the FBI and taken to Hughes and Peevy, Cliff hides the rocket pack. Hughes explains that his rocket pack is a prototype, similar to one that Nazi scientists have, up to now, been unsuccessful <b>in</b> <b>developing,</b> <b>and</b> shows them a horrifying propaganda film that reveals the scope of the Nazis' plans, depicting an army of flying soldiers invading the United States. The FBI agents mention that they are tracking a Nazi spy in Hollywood, whom Cliff realizes to be Sinclair. When Hughes demands the return of the rocket pack, Cliff explains that he needs it to rescue Jenny; he escapes, inadvertently leaving behind a clue to where he is headed.|$|E
5|$|Globally, women's {{access to}} health care remains a challenge, both <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>and</b> {{developed}} countries. In the United States, before the Affordable Health Care Act came into effect, 25% of women of child bearing age lacked health insurance. In the absence of adequate insurance, women are likely to avoid important steps to self care such as routine physical examination, screening and prevention testing, and prenatal care. The situation is aggravated by the fact that women living below the poverty line are at greater risk of unplanned pregnancy, unplanned delivery and elective abortion. Added to the financial burden in this group are poor educational achievement, lack of transportation, inflexible work schedules and difficulty obtaining child care, all of which function to create barriers to accessing health care. These problems are much worse in developing countries. Under 50% of childbirths in these countries are assisted by healthcare providers (e.g. midwives, nurses, doctors) which accounts for higher rates of maternal death, up to 1:1,000 live births. This is despite the WHO setting standards, such as a minimum of four antenatal visits. A lack of healthcare providers, facilities, and resources such as formularies all contribute to high levels of morbidity amongst women from avoidable conditions such as obstetrical fistulae, sexually transmitted diseases and cervical cancer.|$|E

John Fitch had launched the first rudimentary steamboat onto the Delaware River in the late 1780s, and the Philadelphia waterworks was by 1802 operating two low-pressure steam engines to pump water from the Schuylkill River, but these were rare examples and most instances of this new technology were to be found in Europe. Much of the development of steam power had occurred in Great Britain, with Thomas Newcomen and James Watt instrumental <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>and</b> commercializing steam power there and elsewhere in Europe, with several hundred of machines operating there in industrial and labor-saving applications by 1800.|$|E

40|$|Innovation is {{the process}} of making changes, differences, and {{novelties}} in the products and services, adding values and business practices to create economic and social benefit. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to identify the strengths and weaknesses of innovation programs <b>in</b> <b>developed</b> <b>and</b> <b>developing</b> countries. We used a mixed-methods approach, quantitative as survey and qualitative as a multi-case study to examine innovation best practices <b>in</b> <b>developed</b> <b>and</b> <b>developing</b> countries. <b>In</b> addition, four case studies of innovation organisations based on the best practices and successful implementation <b>in</b> the <b>developed</b> <b>and</b> <b>developing</b> countries are selected for examination. The research findings provide guidance, suggestions, and recommendations for future implementation <b>in</b> <b>developed</b> <b>and</b> <b>developing</b> countries for practitioners such as policy makers, governments, funded organizations, and strategic institutions. In conclusion, innovation programs are vital tools for economic growth, knowledge, and technology transfer based on the several indicators such as creativity, entrepreneurship, role of government, role of university, strategic focus, new products, survival rate, job creation, start-up companies, and number of patents. The authors aim to conduct future research which will include a comparative study of innovation case studies between <b>developed</b> <b>and</b> <b>developing</b> countries for policy implications worldwide.

Anemia is one of the important factor which decides the outcome of pregnancy. Affects of anemia among pregnant women includes increased risk of low birth-weight or prematurity, perinatal and neonatal mortality, increased risk of maternal morbidity and mortality. Anaemia is estimated to contribute to more than 115, 000 maternal deaths and 591, 000 perinatal deaths globally per year(4). This study is focused on the awareness of affects of anemia in pregnancy among the persons who are taking care of these women at home(caregivers). Indian customs have food taboo...|$|R
