When he refuses, the offer is passed down to Homer, the next-longest-employed {{individual}} at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. He informs his family that the new job pays better and provides free health-care for the family, but involves moving to Cypress Creek. The Simpson family initially opposes the move, but after they watch a promotional video about the planned community, they agree that it <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> Springfield.

25|$|Objections to {{banning the}} use of {{incandescent}} light bulbs include the higher initial cost of alternatives and lower quality of light of fluorescent lamps. Some people have concerns about {{the health effects of}} fluorescent lamps. However, even though they contain mercury, the environmental performance of CFLs <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> that of light bulbs, mostly because they consume much less energy and therefore strongly reduce the environmental impact of power production. LED lamps are even more efficient, and are free of mercury. They are regarded as the best solution in terms of cost effectiveness and robustness.|$|E

25|$|Lomborg concludes {{his book}} by once again {{reviewing}} the Litany, and {{noting that the}} real {{state of the world}} <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> the Litany claims. According to Lomborg, this discrepancy poses a problem, as it focuses public attention on relatively unimportant issues, while ignoring those that are paramount. In the worst case, The Skeptical Environmentalist argues, the global community is pressured to adopt inappropriate policies which have adverse effects on humanity, wasting resources that could be put to better use in aiding poor countries or fighting diseases such as AIDS. Lomborg thus urges us to look at what he calls the true problems of the world, since solving those will also solve the Litany.|$|E
500|$|The {{instrumental}} demos {{were primarily}} written in majorchords, which Byrne considered slightly [...] "ominous" [...] and surprising from Eno. In spite of this, Byrne's lyrics {{ended up being}} hopeful and spiritual, with themes of redemption—what he considers [...] "optimism {{in spite of the}} dread." [...] The tension between optimism and pessimism and the spiritual themes quickly emerged {{over the course of a}} year in which Byrne was writing lyrics, which he has speculated might be an antidote to being [...] "completely pessimistic and cynical about politics and the state of the world;" [...] for instance, [...] "TheRiver" [...] is about the effects of HurricaneKatrina. He has also cited the political climate of the IraqWar, the beginning of the late-2000s recession, the policies of the GeorgeW.Bush administration, and his 2004 divorce from AdelleLutz as factors that inspired him to create uplifting music. As he explained, [...] "I was surprised that's what came out... The tracks are very different from what I would have done myself. I lean toward things that are more complicated." [...] Eno also thinks the album <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> the songs he imagined when composing them solo.|$|E
500|$|... "The Call of the Simpsons" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{the authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, both criticized and praised the episode saying: [...] "This episode is a bit less {{than the sum of its}} parts. The early stuff at the RV Round-Up <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> the main camping story, although there's some nice Marge-Lisa bonding, and who could resist Maggie and the bears?" [...] In a DVD review of the first season, David B. Grelck gave the episode a rating of 1.5/5, adding [...] "the surrealism of Homer as bigfoot is a major misstep. This type of gag would be very different today, if done at all." [...] Jon Bonné at MSNBC called the episode [...] "a perfect example of the first season’s bizarre and fruitful balance between edgy humor and softly-drawn neuroses" [...] and stated that [...] "it was this combination that made Groening’s shorts for the Ullman show so compelling, and ultimately what made it possible for The Simpsons to break the molds of network television." [...] Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in a review that [...] "while [...] doesn’t offer the continuous highs of the best Simpsons, it’s a generally solid show" [...] and added that [...] "the episode uses a wackier tone than usual for this era, but it works, and the program is consistently fun".|$|E

2500|$|Jerry Pournelle of BYTE {{wrote in}} February 1984 that Turbo Pascal [...] "comes {{close to what}} I think the {{computer}} industry is headed for: well documented, standard, plenty of good features, and a reasonable price". Pournelle disliked the requirement to buy another license to distribute binaries, but noted that [...] "it turns {{out not to be}} a lot more. Borland only wants another $100" [...] more than the $49.95 base price, and that [...] "my first impression of Turbo is that it's probably worth $149.95. It looks to do everything MT+ with the Speed Programming Package does, and maybe even do it faster and better". He reported in July that, according to Kahn, IBM had refused to resell Turbo Pascal unless the price was at least $200; Pournelle noted that [...] "Turbo <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> the Pascal IBM sells", and unlike the latter was compatible with the IBM PCjr. Three BYTE reviewers praised Turbo Pascal in the same issue. One called the DOS version [...] "without doubt, the best software value I have ever purchased", and another called the CP/M version [...] "an excellent product ... deserves praise for this high-value product". The third stated that it was [...] "not a good compiler for developing massive applications", but added that it was greatly superior to BASIC, the programming language usually associated with home computers at the time. He concluded that Turbo Pascal was [...] "a bargain that shouldn't be passed up".|$|E
2500|$|The larger, {{advanced}} {{digital cameras}} offer a non-optical electronic through-the-lens (TTL) view, via an eye-level electronic viewfinder (EVF) {{in addition to}} the rear LCD. The difference in view compared with a DSLR is that the EVF shows a digitally created image, whereas the viewfinder in a DSLR shows an actual optical image via the reflex viewing system. An EVF image has lag time (that is, it reacts with a delay to view changes) and has a lower resolution than an optical viewfinder but achieves parallax-free viewing using less bulk and mechanical complexity than a DSLR with its reflex viewing system. Optical viewfinders tend to be more comfortable and efficient, especially for action photography and in low-light conditions. Compared with digital cameras with LCD electronic viewfinders, there is no time lag in the image: it is always correct as it is being [...] "updated" [...] at the speed of light. This is important for action or sports photography, or any other situation where the subject or the camera is moving quickly. Furthermore, the [...] "resolution" [...] of the viewed image <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> that provided by an LCD or an electronic viewfinder, which can be important if manual focusing is desired for precise focusing, as would be the case in macro photography and [...] "micro-photography" [...] (with a microscope). An optical viewfinder may also cause less eye-strain. However, electronic viewfinders may provide a brighter display in low light situations, as the picture can be electronically amplified.|$|E
2500|$|In {{an article}} on 24 July 1908, Goltz denied the charge often made in the West that the Ottoman {{authorities}} had oppressed the Christian population of Macedonia and were committing systematic human rights abuses. Goltz wrote: [...] "Nevertheless, what the Westerners write about the Turkish government is not honest. Most of the time, {{it is the case}} that those Greeks, Bulgarians, and Serbs, who have had terrible experiences at the hands of their very own nationals, ask for Turkish protection. They know that the Turks are filled with generosity and compassion. They forgot and forgive. For being compassionate to the weak is part of their national traditions and they are proud of it." [...] Goltz denied the charge of widespread human rights abuses against the Christians, writing: [...] "Now, the Ottoman administration there <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> it is thought. The Ottoman governors there, either generals or civilian employees, are young, healthy and knowledgeable men. If they are left to themselves, they can protect the peace perfectly well." [...] Anyhow, Goltz wrote the Europeans [...] "never think about the real owners of the country, the Turks, who constitute the majority in Macedonia … Ottoman staff officers, since 1887, under my direction, have prepared the maps of the Ottoman Balkans and we have found many Turkish villages, which have not been shown in other maps, besides Slav and Greek ones. Turks, in short, have a great right to be in Macedonia. Goltz advised his protégés in the Committee of Union and Progress: [...] "Be powerful so you will not be subject to injustice." [...] In 1910, Goltz advised Pertev to create a para-military youth organization that would serve to [...] "inspire a patriotic and soldierly spirit in youth, to fill them with joy at the fame and greatness of Turkey, {{and at the same time}} to give them a healthy physical education, which prepares them for the military profession." [...] Goltz further added that the purpose of education of youth was [...] "the formation of the patriotic sense, love of the fatherland, soldierly virtues and the toughening of the body, less so the technical preparation of the growing generation." ...|$|E
