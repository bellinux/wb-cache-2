50|$|John William Douglas {{was born}} 1814 in Putney. He became {{interested}} in insects whilst working at Kew Gardens and published many papers and books on entomology. His most important work was The Natural History of the Tineina with the German Philipp Christoph Zeller, Englishman Henry Tibbats Stainton and a Swiss, Heinrich Frey. The Natural History of the Tineina appeared in English, French, German and Latin editions. Although his main interest was the Lepidoptera, Douglas was joint author of the work British Hemiptera Vol.1. <b>Hemiptera-Heteroptera</b> (1865). He was a one-time president of the Royal Entomological Society and editor of The Entomologist's Monthly Magazine. Douglas was a keen promoter of entomology, especially among the young. He died in 1905 in Garlesden.|$|E
40|$|In {{describing}} {{differences in}} morphology, developmental fate and secretion composition in the scent glands {{of the cotton}} harlequin bug Tectocoris diophthalmus we have sought to extend comparative knowledge of the scent gland system in the pentatomoid families within the <b>Hemiptera-Heteroptera.</b> Chemical investigation of the secretions was undertaken by coupled gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The following volatiles were detected: 2 -hexenal, 2 -hexenyl acetate and 2 - octenyl acetate from the metathoracic scent gland (an adult gland); nonanal from the abdominal dorsal first gland (the divided dorsal gland) in the adults; 2 -hexenal, 2 -octenal, 4 -oxohex- 2 -enal, dodecane and tridecane from the abdominal dorsal second and third glands (the undivided dorsal glands) in fifth-instar nymphs. Secretory units are sparse, opener muscles absent, and secretion scarcely, if at all, present {{in the second and}} third dorsal abdominal scent glands in the adults. T. diophthalmus is an addition to the small but growing list of pentatomoids in which biochemical divergence of the abdominal dorsal first gland from the abdominal dorsal second and third glands has been reported. The metathoracic scent gland in T. diophthalmus is comparatively small, as it is in many other aposematic species within the <b>Hemiptera-Heteroptera...</b>|$|E
40|$|Macro {{flora and}} macro {{invertebrates}} were sampled at 20 ponds in County Durham, {{and information on}} forty eight environmental variables was also collected for each site. The environmental variables, plant species records and numbers of each species of corixidae (<b>Hemiptera-Heteroptera)</b> and water beetles (Coleoptera) occurring in each pond were {{used as the basis}} of various methods of ordination and indicator species analysis. A preliminary classification of ponds into five groups is proposed. Information on the species and environmental features which characterize each group are presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} {{a lot of}} Aradidae (<b>Hemiptera-Heteroptera)</b> from the collections of the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie, Leiden. The following new taxa are proposed: Aneurus (Aneurillus) doesburgi n. sp. (Surinam); Mezira surinamensis n. sp. (Surinam); Mezira (Zemira) dentipes n. sp. (Sumatra); Neuroctenus longissimus n. sp. (Brasil); N. surinamensis n. sp. (Surinam); Natapictinus notatus n. sp. and N. surinamensis n. sp. (both from Surinam); Santaremia armata n. sp. (Surinam), and Usingerida montana n. sp. (Java). The genus Halaszfya Kormilev, 1960, is synonymized with Coloborrhinus Bergroth, 1906, and Halaszfya elongata Kormilev, 1960, is synonymized with Coloborrhinus pumilio (Champion, 1898). Halaszfya ovata Kormilev, 1960, is transferred to Coloborrhinus Bergroth, 1906, as its second species. For Coloborrhinus meziroides Kormilev, 1973, a new genus, Paramezira, is proposed...|$|E
