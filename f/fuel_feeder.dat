40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsRodney D. JonesAfter {{remaining}} {{stable for}} several decades, corn price has recently had unprecedented price increases and volatility. United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) predicts an average corn price of $ 5. 80 per bushel for 2008, which is 232 % of its 28 -year (1980 - 2007) {{average price of}} $ 2. 50. The record increase in corn price {{was the result of}} increased starch-based ethanol production associated with increased energy costs, and other factors such as a declining value in the United States dollar, and increased global commodity demand. High corn prices have impacted the profitability of the livestock feeding industry. It was less clear how the record high corn prices would affect the cow-calf industry since corn is not a significant input for cow-calf enterprises. This study quantified the relationship between cow-calf profitability and corn price. Because feed costs for a cow-calf producer are among the highest variable costs for the operation, both grazing and non-grazing feed costs were estimated as a function of corn price. Models were estimated to determine if a relationship between corn price and Returns Over Variable Costs (ROVC) at the cow-calf level could be identified. Corn price from 1978 - 2007 explained none of the variability in grass grazing rental rate, however when the projected 2008 corn price was included in the analysis, corn price explained 10 % of the variation in grass grazing rates. Year (linear time trend) and corn price from 1978 - 2008 explained 88 % of historical grass grazing rental rate variability, 71 % of alfalfa price variability, and 63 % of other hay price variability in Kansas. These results suggest that the new corn market paradigm likely will increase the relationship between corn price and feed costs at the cow-calf level. Several models were evaluated using bulk diesel <b>fuel</b> price, <b>feeder</b> calf price, corn price, alfalfa price, other hay price, and grass grazing rental rate to estimate Kansas cow-calf producer ROVC. Models that included diesel <b>fuel</b> price, <b>feeder</b> calf price, grazing rent, and one of the harvested feeds (corn, alfalfa, or other hay) price explained 90 - 91 % of the variability in ROVC. Models that included diesel <b>fuel</b> price, <b>feeder</b> calf price, and either grazing rent or corn price explained less of the variability in ROVC; using grazing rent explained 89 % and using corn price explained 79 %. Including grass grazing rental rate along with corn price, feeder calf price, and bulk diesel fuel price improved the model's ability to predict ROVC, explaining 91 % of the variability. While cow-calf producers might use very little corn directly in their operations, this research shows that corn price is an important determinant of cow-calf production returns, and corn price can be used by producers to plan for future rising costs in order to maximize returns...|$|R
50|$|In 1995, a plywood {{cover was}} left in the boiler after {{completion}} of a maintenance outage. When the heat transport pumps were restarted, the cover was sucked into the heat transport system where it caused catastrophic damage to one of the pumps. The cause of the incident was lack of control of temporary modifications, poor work management, lack of foreign material exclusion (FME) measures, and human error. There was no public safety significance to the event, since the reactor had been shut down long enough that decay heat power was below the level that required coolant flow. However, the breach of the pressure boundary at the damaged pump created a radiation hazard for workers, and debris in <b>feeders,</b> <b>fuel</b> channels and potentially other Heat Transport and Auxiliaries pipework could have created a significant safety hazard during at-power operation. The cost of pump repairs, and the production downtime caused by the incident and its cleanup, was significant. The incident also left wood and metal debris unrecoverable in the cooling system. Maintenance incidents at Lepreau in 1995 cost the facility more than $50 million in repairs and replacement power.|$|R

The main wings of the B-17 consisted of an [...] "inboard wing" [...] structural panel mounted to the fuselage and mounting the engines and flaps, and an [...] "outboard wing" [...] structural panel joined to the inboard wing and carrying only the ailerons. The Tokyo tanks were installed {{on either side of}} the joint (a load-bearing point) where the two wing portions were connected. Five cells, totalling 270 gal capacity, sat side by side in the outboard wing and were joined by a fuel line to the main tank delivering fuel to the outermost engine. The sixth cell was located in the space where the wing sections joined, with the remaining three cells located side-by-side within the inboard wing, and these four cells delivered 270 gal of <b>fuel</b> to the <b>feeder</b> tank for the inboard engine. The same arrangement was repeated on the opposite wing. The Tokyo tanks added 1,080 gal of fuel to the 1,700 gal carried in the six regular wing tanks and the 820 gal that could be carried in a tank that could be mounted in the bomb bay, for a combined total of 3,600 gal.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the source}} of air {{pollutants}} is emission from local coal-fired boiler-houses and domestic heating boilers. The consequence of incineration of municipal waste is the introduction of additional pollutants into the atmosphere, including fly ash. The aim of this work was to evaluate the particle size distribution of fly ash emitted by coal combustion and co-incineration of coal with municipal waste in a domestic 18 kW central heating boiler equipped with an automatic <b>fuel</b> <b>feeder.</b> Mixtures of bituminous coal with different types of solid waste (5, 10 and 15 % of mass fraction) were used. Solid waste types consisted of: printed, colored PE caps, fragmented cable trunking, fragmented car gaskets and shredded tires from trucks. During the incineration of a given mixture of municipal waste with bituminous coal, the velocity of exhaust gas was specified, the concentration and mass flow of fly ash were determined together with the physico-chemical parameters of the exhaust gas, the samples of emitted fly ash were taken as the test material. Particle size analysis of fly ash was performed using laser particle sizer Fritch Analysette 22. The PM 10 share from all fly ashes from incineration of mixtures was about 100 %. Differences were noted between PM 2. 5 and PM 1...|$|E

However, for the energy services to befavourable to the environment, there should be a balance with the environmental protection, and we cancall that “Sustainable Innovative Development”. “EXPLORE Polygeneration” initiative will serve as an important tool to promote the application ofrenewable technologies extending to the future sustainable energy engineering field. This paper is intendedin investigating a suitable fuel supply for the microturbine based micro CHP system available at theDivision of Heat and Power Technology, KTH, Sweden; for a site called “Alema Farm PLC”, Bishoftu,Ethiopia. Though there is a large biomass energy resource and a huge potential to produce hydroelectric power inEthiopia, the modern energy sector is very small and the energy system is mainly characterized by biomassfuel supplies and household energy consumption. The nation’s limited biomass energy resource is believedto have been depleting at an increasingly faster rate. Of the many and surplus amount of renewable energy resources available in and around Alema FarmPLC, poultry litter and pig’s manure are selected to be the two main energy sources for the CHP systemavailable in the lab, after passing through different conversion techniques.

40|$|In this thesis, a {{planning}} methodology is proposed for nuclear refurbishment projects {{as a means}} to address project objectives, influential factors, constraints, and their interdependencies to attain a more reliable estimate of project outcomes. As part of this process, the uncertainty and impact of risk events around project outcomes are taken into account. The proposed methodology consists of two stages. The first stage addresses the impact of commonly identified risks (i. e., Type I risks) and uncertainty on the project outcomes. Also, the interdependence among shift schedule, productivity rate, calendar duration, and risk registers within each identified what-if scenario has been taken into account. The confidence in achieving each of the what-if scenarios is determined using Monte Carlo simulation and a 3 -dimensional joint confidence limit model. Based on the simulation results, the deterministic values of the selected project outcomes and the mean values of the resultant distributions are driven primarily by uncertainty, and the distribution tails represent the impact of materialized risks. Also, the probability of failure for each project outcome is less than the joint probability of failure for multiple outcomes. In the second stage of the methodology, the resultant distribution tails (attained from the previous stage) are explored by primarily assessing the impact of outliers (i. e., Type II risks) on project outcomes. Although outliers are typically considered rare events with extreme impacts, the scale and complexity of megaprojects such as refurbishment of nuclear reactors leads to a more frequent occurrence of such events. The applied methodology stems from the reliability analysis approach used to partially justify soft error within integrated circuits due to the observed commonalities such as scale and complexity. A combination of probability theory, Critical Path Method, and Monte Carlo simulation is used to assess the true probability of occurrence for such events. Based on the simulation results, the outliers should be acknowledged and incorporated in the risk management plan of large-scale and complex ventures such as megaprojects. The proposed methodology is validated via Delphi and sensitivity analysis, and functional demonstration using information from an actual multi-billion dollar nuclear refurbishment project and a unique full-scale mock-up of the reactor’s <b>fuel</b> channels and <b>feeders...</b>|$|R
