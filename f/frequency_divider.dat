The multiplier will make the VCO output a sub-multiple (rather than a multiple) of the reference frequency. A mixer can translate the VCO frequency by a fixed offset.

25|$|A {{phase locked}} loop is a {{feedback}} control system. It compares the phases of two input signals and produces an error signal that {{is proportional to the}} difference between their phases. The error signal is then low pass filtered and used to drive a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) which creates an output frequency. The output frequency is fed through a <b>frequency</b> <b>divider</b> back to the input of the system, producing a negative feedback loop. If the output frequency drifts, the phase error signal will increase, driving the frequency in the opposite direction so as to reduce the error. Thus the output is locked to the frequency at the other input. This other input is called the reference and is usually derived from a crystal oscillator, which is very stable in frequency.

30|$|As can be {{seen from}} Fig. 1, on the SCC, tiles are {{arranged}} in voltage and frequency islands. There are seven voltage and 28 frequency islands on SCC. Each tile on SCC is one frequency island, while MCs, VRC, and the mesh make {{up the rest of the}} islands. In contrast to frequency island whereby each tile is an island, six voltage island contains 2 × 2 array of tiles (four tiles per island) each, while entire mesh network is regarded as seventh island. The voltage of six islands made up of tiles can be controlled by using the VRC. As described in the SCC architecture specification document [16], the VRC allows a set of voltages between 0 and 1.3 V in increments of 6.25 mV at island granularity. However, practically, the usable voltage range is 0.7 to 1.3 V (lower voltage setting will require hard reset of the SCC to resume normal operation again). The frequency management system provides a configuration register for each tile. The maximum frequency that can be set is dependent on the current voltage level and can be varied between 100 to 800 MHz. To change the voltage, a value that contains island identifier and actual voltage value is written to VRC. For <b>frequency</b> change, a <b>divider</b> value between 2 and 16 is used to select operating <b>frequency</b> of tile. <b>Divider</b> value is used to divide global frequency of 1600 MHz, providing 800 to 100 MHz and all the values in between.

Frequency synthesizer is a system that generate a set of frequency, which is an integer multiple of input frequency. After that fractional frequency synthesizer was inventesd. In which output frequency is fractional multiple of input frequency. They suddenly used in mobile communication and in spread spectrum applications and their use continuously increasing. Communication used single carrier frequency, which is fixed. After modulation when modulating signal transmitted, then frequency of modulating signal will change because of noise. So at receiver to get the input signal, we require input carrier frequency so that we require frequency synthesizer. PLL is closed loop frequency system that can be used as a frequency synthesizer and for synchronizing purpose. PLL’s are having building block like, Phase frequency detector (PFD), charge pump, loop filter, voltage controlled oscillator (VCO). When it used as a frequency synthesizer than one another block require which is called divider circuit. PFD compare input signal frequency and phase with feedback signal and generate UP and DOWN signal. Which drive charge pump, that convert two signal into one signal. That signal increase or decrease the charge of loop filter. By which output frequency of VCO will change, it may be increase or decrease depending on charge on loop filter.

40|$|High speed {{frequency}} dividers are critical parts of frequency synthesisers in wireless systems. These dividers allow the output frequency from a voltage controlled oscillator {{to be compared}} with a much lower external reference frequency that is commonly used in these synthesisers. Common trade-offs in high frequency dividers are speed of division, power consumption, real estate area, and output signal dynamic range. In this paper we demonstrate {{the design of a}} high <b>frequency,</b> low power <b>divider</b> in 0. 18 µm SiGe BiCMOS technology. Three dividers are presented, which are a regenerative divider, a master-slave divider, and a combination of regenerative and master-slave dividers to perform a divide-by- 8 chain. The dividers are used as part of a 60 GHz frequency synthesizer. The simulation results are in agreement with measured performance of the regenerative divider. At 48 GHz the divider consumes 18 mW from a 1. 8 V supply voltage. The master-slave divider operates up to 36 GHz from a very low supply voltage, 1. 8 V.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Electrical and Computer EngineeringW. B. KuhnAn {{analysis}} of frequency pulling in a varactor-tuned LC VCO under coupling from an on-chip PA is presented. The large-signal {{behavior of the}} VCO's inversion-mode MOS varactors is outlined, and the susceptibility of the VCO to frequency pulling from PA aggressor signals with various modulation schemes is discussed. We show that if the aggressor signal is aperiodic, band-limited, or amplitude-modulated, the varactor-tuned LC VCO will experience frequency pulling due to time-modulation of the varactor capacitance. However, if the aggressor signal has constant-envelope phase modulation, VCO pulling can be eliminated, even {{in the presence of}} coupling, through careful choice of VCO <b>frequency</b> and <b>divider</b> ratio. Additional mitigation strategies, including new inductor topologies and system-level architectural choices, are also examined. The analysis is then applied to improve a fully-integrated half-duplex UHF micro- transceiver in which signal coupling between the LO and PA caused frequency pulling that prevented the use of QPSK signaling at certain data rates. We determine that a VCO operating at 4 x transmit frequency will be naturally insensitive to pulling from QPSK signals. To validate the proposed solution, a prototype IC containing a pair of QPSK transmitters with integrated 100 mW Class-C PAs was designed and fabricated in 0. 18 um SOI. The transmitters [...] one utilizing a 2 x VCO, one utilizing a 4 x VCO [...] were designed to closely match the performance of the original microtransceiver when transmitting QPSK data. The transmitter with the 2 x VCO experienced frequency pulling from the PA while transmitting QPSK data, but the transmitter with the 4 x VCO did not, thereby confirming the analysis in this work. A revision of the microtransceiver was designed in 0. 5 [mu]m SOS utilizing an off- chip PA inductor to reduce signal coupling with the VCO. A second revision of the microtransceiver with two prototype transmitters was designed in 0. 25 [mu]m SOS uti- lizing 4 x VCOs and figure- 8 VCO inductors for maximum insensitivity to pulling from QPSK and band-limited modulation, as well as other design improvements that leverage the higher f[subscript]t of the smaller process. Both revisions also include a hardware FSK modulator, a new charge pump, and a redesigned fractional-N synthesizer to attenuate a divided-reference spur in the IF output. These revisions of the radio will enable future researchers to focus on system-level applications where highly-integrated medium-power transceivers with fully-functioning IQ modulation are needed...|$|R

40|$|High-performance {{digital systems}} use clocks to {{sequence}} operations and synchronize between functional units and between ICs. Clock frequencies and data {{rates have been}} increasing with each generation of processing technology and processor architecture. Phase locked-loops (PLLs) are widely used to generate well-timed on-chip clocks in high-performance digital systems. A PLL is a closed loop frequency system that locks the phase of an output signal to an input reference signal. PLL’s are widely used in computer, radio, and telecommunications systems where {{it is necessary to}} stabilize a generated signal or to detect signals. The term “lock” refers to a constant or zero phase difference between two signals. The signal from the feedback path is compared to the input reference signal, until the two signals are locked. If the phase is unmatched, this is called the unlocked state, and the signal is sent to each component in the loop to correct the phase difference. These components consist of the Phase Frequency Detector (PFD), the charge pump (CP), the low pass filter (LPF), the voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) and divide by counter. The PFD detects any phase differences in and and then generates an error signal. According to that error signal the CP either increases or decreases the amount of charge to the LPF. This amount of charge either speeds up or slows down the VCO. The loop continues in this process until the phase difference between and is zero or constant—this is the locked mode. After the loop has attained a locked status, the loop still continues in the process but the output of each component is constant. The output signal has the same phase and/or <b>frequency</b> as. A <b>divider</b> can be used in the feedback path to synthesize a frequency different than that of the reference signal. The application I chose in designing the PLL was a frequency synthesizer.
