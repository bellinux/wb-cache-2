2500|$|A <b>friend</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{the world}} was shaking. I believe it is, not only the {{physical}} world, but the mental world. There never {{was a time when}} mind was so agitated as the present, not only in this continent, but the Old World is shaken. Witness the revolution in Spain. [...] Human bondage soon will exist only in history, and religious intolerance be a dream of the past, and mind will constitute manhood, not physical types or color of skin. And happy are they who live in this agitation, and assist in its development! How strange that great lessons of truth must be forced upon the mind by error as the contrast, and a startling wrong perpetrated to ensure right, and a long lethargic sleep to produce a full awakening! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Do {{you think}} so?' says I; upon which my <b>friend</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{how she had}} {{actually}} gone down on her knees to him and 'Save Colonel Altamont!' ...|$|E
60|$|In reply my <b>friend</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> {{that he had}} {{received}} a remittance, and had hopes of recovering a considerable sum, lost {{in some way that}} he chose to conceal.|$|E
50|$|My <b>Friends</b> <b>Told</b> <b>Me</b> About You charts {{the journey}} of {{a man at the}} {{beginning}} of a downward spiral. Paranoia, confusion, and anger start to color all that he knows to be true and as reality blurs with his subconscious fears, an alternate world propelled by violence and mistrust begins to take over. As sonic as it is visual, Dengler also composed the original score for My <b>Friends</b> <b>Told</b> <b>Me</b> About You in collaboration with acclaimed English clarinetist Ian Mitchell.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was {{certainly}} surprised when I {{heard that you}} were going so far away," [...] Godfrey said, [...] "as my <b>friends</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that you had property. It seemed almost like going into banishment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am glad {{indeed to}} see you, Captain Campbell," [...] Enghien said warmly, {{holding out his}} hand; [...] "I feared that you were killed. Some of my <b>friends</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that you were struck down in the third charge, {{and that they had}} not seen you since and feared that you were slain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'A {{very sad}} tale, senora, but {{one which is}} not finished. While he lay dying, my <b>friend</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that in his early life he had plighted troth with a certain English maid, named--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think you'll {{find the}} roads around Rayville all right," [...] called Mr. Basswood to him. [...] "My <b>friend</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{that they were}} in good condition, {{especially}} those {{on the other side of}} the town." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{is always}} {{sufficient}} reserve {{of the ninth}} ray stored in the great building to maintain the present Martian atmosphere for a thousand years, and the only fear, as my new <b>friend</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> was that some accident might befall the pumping apparatus.|$|E
60|$|I was born, as my <b>friends</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> at {{the city}} of Poitiers, in the {{province}} or county of Poitou, in France, from whence I was brought to England by my parents, who fled for their religion about the year 1683, when the Protestants were banished from France by the cruelty of their persecutors.|$|R
5000|$|On 6 Feb 2008 Guo Quan told Jane Macartney, of The Times [...] "that he had {{now found}} that the Chinese Yahoo! site had also blocked his name and he planned to bring actions against both companies." [...] Mr Guo said: [...] "Since January 1 a lot of <b>friends</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that {{websites}} with my name had been closed. They <b>told</b> <b>me</b> it's impossible to search for my information on Google and Yahoo!" ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the time}} between Antics (2004) and Our Love to Admire (2007), Dengler took up an {{interest}} in film composition and scoring. He now actively works on original film and TV projects. His work in this medium includes the short film Golgotha, which he wrote, produced and scored, as well as My <b>Friends</b> <b>Told</b> <b>Me</b> About You, {{in which he was}} a lead actor.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know, lord. I {{know nothing}} except what my <b>friend</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> which I thought {{it right to}} {{communicate}} to you instantly. I asked him the time, however, {{and he said that}} he believed the date was fixed for one night after next Sabbath." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Ah, then, let us {{reverse the}} parts!’ said Otto. ‘It is {{ourselves}} we cannot forgive, when we deny forgiveness to another—so a <b>friend</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> last night. On these terms, Seraphina, {{you see how}} generously I have forgiven myself. But am not I to be forgiven? Come, then, forgive yourself—and me.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Whenever {{you give}} the {{interviewer}} a fact," [...] he said, [...] "give him another fact that will contradict it. Then he'll go away with a jumble that he can't use at all. Be gentle, be sweet, smile like an idiot--just be natural." [...] That's what my <b>friend</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> to do, and I did it.|$|E
5000|$|Though {{his first}} novel was {{published}} in the late 1950s, he did not gain prominence until the late 1980s, when he was over 60 years old, with the publication of Wittgenstein's Mistress. From that point, his reputation as a writer steadily grew, so much so that he told an interviewer: [...] "One of my <b>friends</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> to be careful before I become well known for being unknown." ...|$|R
60|$|On their {{leaving the}} room {{to get ready for}} their journey, my <b>friend</b> Roberts <b>told</b> <b>me</b> the strangers were the poet Wordsworth, his wife and sister.|$|R
60|$|Isaac. Why, then, I {{believe they}} are gone to--that is, my <b>friend</b> Carlos <b>told</b> <b>me</b> he had left Donna Clara--dear Ferdinand, keep your hands off--at the convent of St. Catherine.|$|R
6000|$|The other--an {{even more}} {{striking}} instance of the possibility, at least, of heroism anywhere and everywhere--is Mr. Thackeray's [...] "Esmond." [...] On the meaning of that book I can speak with authority. For my dear and regretted <b>friend</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> himself that my interpretation of it was the true one; {{that this was the}} lesson which he meant men to learn therefrom.|$|E
60|$|The {{horse was}} chosen for me by a friend. He was an {{excellent}} beast (the horse), excelling, as my <b>friend</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> in muscle and wit. Nothing better than this could be said about a horse. He was a sorrel animal, quite handsome, gentle enough for Euphemia to drive, and not too high-minded {{to do a little}} farm-work, if necessary. He was exactly the animal I needed.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{whole story}} is extraordinary," [...] Dick Chetwynd said; [...] "for {{we have every}} reason to believe that those fellows, or at least one or two of them, have been patiently {{watching}} for a chance of carrying off those diamonds for twenty years. When my <b>friend</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> of it ten days ago I did not believe that it could be possible; but he has certainly shown that he was correct in his opinion." ...|$|E
50|$|But my cannibal <b>friends</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{they were}} taboo (Tapu, meaning sacred), and I {{had to throw}} them away {{as they had been}} {{gathered}} from a place where a house had been built. Another time I happened to lay my knife on Tiroa's cap being Taiaroa, a chief from the Otago harbour area, on this he took the knife & kept it 2 or 3 days, saying it was taboo taboo. I was therefore obliged to eat with my fingers.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are known}} as the Scarlet Pimpernel," [...] she said suddenly. [...] "Suzanne de Tournai was my <b>friend.</b> She <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> You saved her and her family, and now ... oh, my God!" [...] she exclaimed, [...] "how shall we ever repay you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You won't be able {{to indulge}} in all your mad schemes," [...] he laughed, [...] "but there'll be enough to help on a few. And you will be among <b>friends.</b> Arthur <b>told</b> <b>me</b> he had {{explained}} it to you and that you had agreed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I want to {{ask about}} the Rain Bluff mine. A little time ago a stock-jobbing <b>friend</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> it ought to turn out a good thing. He said that {{whatever}} Allinson's took up could be relied on, and {{it was clear that he}} had a high opinion of your house. On the strength of it, I put some money into the venture." [...] He paused with a smile. [...] "Now, you are wondering why a man with means enough to speculate should go to West Africa?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Only that, mother. A blissful {{state of}} brevity {{to have come}} to, isn't it? And some of the {{telegraph}} clerks fall into queer mistakes, too, owing to their ignorance. One of the rules is that the words sent must be bona fide words--not a mere unmeaning arrangement of letters. My City <b>friend</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that on three different occasions telegrams of his were refused, because the words were not known, yet each of them {{was taken from the}} Bible! One of the telegrams was, `Blastus unholy.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{first time}} I began to sneeze, a <b>friend</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{to go and}} bathe my feet in hot water and go to bed. I did so. Shortly afterward, another friend advised me {{to get up and}} take a cold shower-bath. I did that also. Within the hour, another friend assured me that it was policy to [...] "feed a cold and starve a fever." [...] I had both. So I thought it best to fill myself up for the cold, and then keep dark and let the fever starve awhile.|$|E
6000|$|MENDIP. [Taking MORE'S hand] Give me {{credit for}} a little philosophy, my <b>friend.</b> Mrs. More <b>told</b> <b>me</b> you'd be back to-day. Have you heard? ...|$|R

5000|$|My <b>Friends</b> <b>Told</b> <b>Me</b> About You is a {{short film}} written, produced, and scored by lead actor Carlos Dengler who is the former bassist of the band Interpol. It is co-written and {{directed}} by Daniel Ryan and co-produced by Todd Eckert of award-winning Joy Division biopic, Control. The cast also includes Risa Sarachan as Belle and Fredric Stone as Stanley. [...] The film was shot on digital video tape, {{in and around the}} Chicago area during 2007 and 2008.

6000|$|... "I yearn to tell you, if only I {{can trust}} you;" [...] and Lucy knelt {{down at the}} feet of Mrs. Robarts, looking up into her face and smiling through the {{remaining}} drops of her tears. [...] "I would fain tell you, but I do not know you yet--whether you are quite true. I could be true--true against all the world, if my <b>friend</b> <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> I will tell you, Fanny, if you say that you can be true. But if you doubt yourself, if you must whisper all to Mark--then let us be silent." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{thank you}} {{enormously}} for your confidential passage, {{which is most}} interesting and heartening.... And let me mention in exchange for your confidence that a <b>friend</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> this afternoon {{that he had been}} within a few days talking with ----, one of the American naval attachés, whose competence he ranks high and to whom he had put some question relative to the naval sense of the condition of these islands. To which the reply had been: [...] "You may take it from me that England is absolutely impregnable and invincible"--and ---- repeated over--"impregnable and invincible!" [...] Which kind of did me good.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought the}} matter out," [...] my <b>friend</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> [...] "imagining all the {{possible}} alternatives, including that of knocking the fellow down and making a bolt, {{and came to the}} conclusion that his first suggestion would, on the whole, result in the least discomfort. But I had no idea that picking up small scraps of thin paper off greasy stones was the business that I found it! It took me nearly ten minutes, and afforded amusement, I calculate, to over a thousand people. But it is a good law, mind you: all I wish is that I had known it beforehand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've found {{something}} {{much better than}} ruins!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "I've found two <b>friends</b> who <b>told</b> <b>me</b> how to find you, which I could never have done without them. They must come and have tea with us. What a pity that we've just had luncheon." [...] Could they not somehow revoke that meal? ...|$|R
5000|$|When we {{came near}} the town, Friends {{would have shown}} me a way through {{the back side of}} it; but I told them my way was through the streets. Taking Paul Morrice to guide me through the town, I rode on. As we rode through the market-place, and by the mayor's door, he, seeing me, said, [...] "There goes George Fox"; but he had not power to stop me. When we had passed the sentinels, and were come over the bridge, we went to a Friend's house and alighted. There the <b>Friends</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> what a rage was in the town, and how many {{warrants}} were granted to take me. While I was sitting there I felt the evil spirit at work in the town, stirring up mischief against me; and I felt the power of the Lord strike at that evil spirit. By-and-by some other <b>friends</b> coming in, <b>told</b> <b>me</b> it was over the town, and amongst the magistrates that I was in the town. I said, [...] "Let the devil do his worst." [...] After we had refreshed ourselves, I called for my horse, and having a Friend to guide me, we went on our way.|$|R
60|$|It {{would not}} {{surprise}} {{me to find}} that many persons have some such material image or presentment of the spiritual entities they are taught to believe in at too tender an age. Recently, in comparing childish memories with a <b>friend,</b> he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that he too always saw God as a blue object, but of no definite shape.|$|R
