5|$|According to Maple's account, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of Pickingill's life, when he {{had become}} very ill, the local people moved him to the {{infirmary}} against his will, where he declared that at his funeral there would be one more demonstration of his magical powers. Many locals interpreted this as coming true when as the hearse carrying his coffin drew up to the churchyard, the horses stepped out of their harness shafts. His body was subsequently buried in the church's graveyard, whilst his abandoned house gradually became dilapidated before falling down.|$|E

5|$|In 1943 Serong {{served as}} General Staff Officer 2 with the {{combined}} 6th and 7th Divisions on the Atherton Tableland in Far North Queensland, {{where they were}} resting and retraining prior to conducting further operations. In early 1944 he instructed on the staff course at Cabarlah. That August, he moved to Aitape {{to prepare for the}} deployment of the 6th Division. He was later attached to American forces for the landing on Morotai Island in the Netherlands East Indies in mid-September 1944. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of the war, Serong was mentioned in despatches for his actions fighting the Japanese at Wewak, whilst serving with the infantry in the 35th Battalion. During an incident on 21 July 1945, he commanded a force of three platoons and native police on a patrol to destroy a Japanese ammunition dump. Although serving more time in training roles than in combat, during the war Serong had made important contacts with whom he would later work in future postings, including Colonel Reg Pollard, who went on to become Chief of the General Staff (CGS), and Colonel Charles Spry, later the Director of Military Intelligence and the Director General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO).|$|E

However, as {{the campaign}} proceeded, it became apparent that Lenihan's victory was by no means a foregone conclusion, and that Robinson was a serious contender.

This shocked Douglas, who did more research and worked on his lines again and again, pushing himself harder than he had before. All of this hard work culminated with the [...] "Greed is good" [...] speech. Stone planned to use a Fortune magazine cover in exchange for promotional advertisements, but Forbes magazine made a similar offer. Stone stuck with Fortune, which upset Forbes publisher Malcolm Forbes, who turned down a later request to use his private yacht. Stone switched from 12- to 14-hour shooting days <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> in order to finish principal photography before an impending Directors Guild of America strike and finished five days ahead of schedule.
