40|$|AbstractPaper {{introduces}} results {{related to}} the application of advanced milling cutters provided with shank style of tool <b>insert</b> <b>holder.</b> Design of prototypes of tool bodies is based on calculations of theoretical number of tool edges. Bodies of milling cutter include holes to mount tool <b>insert</b> <b>holder</b> while two types of insert shape as round and octagonal are used in milling cutter design. Based on measuring of cutting forces when milling planar surfaces, critical cutting conditions leading to the tool damage are identified and they are compared with commercial milling cutters. Applying cutting force data, operation safety is being studied concerning outer appearance of tool failure. Application of Finite Element Method is {{used to assess the}} critical spots leading to the <b>insert</b> <b>holder</b> failure. Maximum stress which brings about ductile fracture of shank style's <b>insert</b> <b>holder</b> has been found out by FEM modelling. Operation capability of tool inserts is compared with tool performance data. Surface roughness and short term tool wear testing was used as tool performance criteria to asses capability of new cutting tools in face milling operations. Surface quality produced by that kind of milling cutter is referred to as semi finishing and finishing cut. Advantages and limitations of that milling cutter innovation are discussed.

40|$|Since {{more and}} more {{products}} are custom made the manufacturers are facing increasing demands requiring both time and cost efficiency. With conventional manufacturing methods it is often costly to produce custom made products in low volumes due to large initial onetime costs for machines, setup etcetera. Today {{it is possible to}} produce real, working products in metal materials with additive techniques such as laser sintering. Small grains of metal are melted or sintered together using a thin laser beam, creating precise geometries directly from a CAD-file. This thesis work was carried out at the CTSP department at Sandvik Coromant in Sandviken. The purpose is to show what kind of functional and design improvements can be achieved with the manufacturing technique as well as what limitations it implies. This is to be made by exemplifying a redevelopment of a Corocut <b>insert</b> <b>holder</b> for grooving operations. The aim is to successfully produce a functional <b>insert</b> <b>holder</b> conformal to the limitations of additive manufacturing. An analysis of the design process when designing for additive manufacturing should also be generated. The redeveloped <b>insert</b> <b>holder</b> had a decreased volume and a more slimmed design. Instead of a cooling channel with a diameter of 3 mm two channels with a diameter of 2 mm and 1 mm was added. The acute angles could be eliminated by using additive manufacturing, creating a better flow of the cutting fluid. The hinge was moved and more chip space could be generated. The <b>insert</b> <b>holder</b> was laser sintered in a machine from Concept laser. The additive process was made on top of a Capto coupling which had been sent to the manufacturer. Operations to create the insert seat and the clamping were made afterwards. Testes showed a well functional <b>insert</b> <b>holder</b> for grooving with a very gathered fluid jet from the 1 mm cooling channel and good chip breaks. The manufacturing technique is applicable for Sandvik Coromant products, although the exact product areas need to be analysed. Examples of potential areas are for products with high demands on the cooling channels, spare parts, or areas where having different materials in the same geometry can be an advantage. The manufacturing technique is most suited for custom made (special) products, though the profit opportunities have not been analysed. Although, manufacturing products with additive techniques give a lot of freedom to the designers and make it possible to produce products that have not been possible before. Unique design and functions in a product may very well compensate for the higher price the customer has to pay. Validerat; 20110124 (anonymous...|$|E

40|$|A {{convenient}} and effective new approach for analyzing DWPF samples {{involves the use}} of inserts with volumes of 1. 5 [...] 3 ml placed in the neck of 14 ml sample vials. The inserts have rims that conform to the rim of the vials so that they sit straight and stable in the vial. The DWPF tank sampling system fills the pre-weighed insert rather than the entire vial, so the vial functions only as the <b>insert</b> <b>holder.</b> The shielded cell operator then removes the vial cap and decants the insert containing the sample into a plastic bottle, crucible, etc., for analysis. Inert materials such as Teflon, plastic, and zirconium are used for the insert so it is unnecessary to separate the insert from the sample for most analyses. The key technique advantage of using inserts to take DWPF samples versus filling sample vials is that it provides a {{convenient and}} almost foolproof way of obtaining and handling small volumes of slurry samples in a shielded cell without corrupting the sample. Since the insert allows the entire sample to be analyzed, this approach eliminates the errors inherent with subsampling heterogeneous slurries that comprise DWPF samples. Slurry samples can then be analyzed with confidence. Analysis times are dramatically reduced by eliminating the drying and vitrification steps normally used to produce a homogeneous solid sample. Direct dissolution and elemental analysis of slurry samples are achieved in 8 hours or less compared with 40 hours for analysis of vitrified slurry samples. Comparison of samples taken in inserts versus full vials indicate that the insert does not significantly affect sample composition...|$|E

40|$|International audienceComputer Aided Process Planning (CAPP) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} advances in the area of manufacturing engineering which plays a critical role, linking Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) activities. CAPP determines automatically the use of available resources, including machines, cutting <b>inserts,</b> <b>holders,</b> appropriate machining parameters such as cutting speed, feed rate, depth of cut, and generates automatic sequences of operations and instructions to convert a raw material into a required product with good surface finish.

The vacuum in the tube then automatically draws the needed blood directly from the patient's vein. Multiple vacuum tubes can be attached to and removed in turn from a single needle, allowing multiple samples to be obtained from a single procedure. This is possible due to the multiple sample sleeve, which is a flexible rubber fitting over the posterior end of the needle cannula which seals the needle until it is pushed out of the way. This keeps blood from freely draining out of the back of the needle inserted in the patient's vein, as each test tube is removed and the next impaled.

40|$|In {{the fight}} to reduce carbon emissions, {{it is easy to}} see the {{necessity}} of reducing energy consumption. Buildings consume a large amount of energy, and have significant potential for energy savings. One tool for realising these potential savings is building simulation. To be able to use building simulation, accurate models for windows are needed. The models include individual layer models, to determine the solar and longwave radiative behaviours, as well as whole-system models to determine heat flows through the various layers of fenestration systems. This thesis looks at both kinds of models for incorporating windows into building simulations. A new network whole-system model is implemented, and integrated into the California Simulation Engine building simulation software. This model is also used as the calculation engine for a stand-alone rating tool. Additionally, a measurement technique used to measure off-normal solar properties of drapery materials, as part of developing shading layer models, is investigated using a Monte Carlo simulation. The network model uses a very general resistance network, allowing heat transfer between any two layers in a complex fenestration system (CFS), whether they are adjacent or not, between any layer and the indoor or outdoor side, or between the indoor and outdoor sides, although this last case is unlikely. Convective and radiative heat transfer are treated using the same format, resulting in increased stability. This general resistance network is used to calculate indices of merit for the CFS using numerical experiments. This approach requires fewer iterations to solve than previous solution methods, and is more flexible. The off-normal measurement technique which was investigated used a sample <b>holder</b> <b>inserted</b> into an integrating sphere. This is a non-standard way of using an integrating sphere, and early analyses did not provide conclusive information as to the effect of the sample holder. A Monte Carlo analysis confirmed the amount of beam attenuation as being 20 % for the sample holder used in the experiments. Also con firmed was the effectiveness of dual-beam integrating spheres in correcting for the presence of a sample holder. The stand-alone rating tool which uses the general network framework, incorporates an easy-to-use visual interface. This tool models multiple types of shading layers with no restrictions on how they are combined. Users can easily change any one layer to see the effects of different arrangements.

40|$|Objectives: Two {{isotopes}} of scandium, 47 Sc and 44 Sc, are perspective radionuclides respectively for radiotherapy and diagnostic imaging. 47 Sc decays {{with the}} half-life of 3. 35 days and maximum β- energy of 600 keV. It also emits low-energy γ-radiation (Eγ = 159 keV) suitable for simultaneous imaging. The other scandium radionuclide - 44 Sc (t 1 / 2 = 3. 92 h) {{is an ideal}} β+-emitter in PET diagnosis. It can be used instead of 68 Ga, because 44 Sc has longer half-life and forms stable radiobioconjugates with a structure similar to 90 Y and 177 Lu, what is important in planning radionuclide therapy [1]. 44 Sc can be obtained as a daughter radionuclide of long-lived 44 Ti (t 1 / 2 = 60. 4 y) from 44 Ti/ 44 Sc generator or can be produced by nuclear reaction 44 Ca (p, n) 44 Sc in small cyclotrons. The aim of our work was to find optimal parameters for 44 CaCO 3 target irradiation {{in order to maximize}} production of 44 Sc with minimal impurities of longer-lived 44 mSc and development of simple chemical procedure for separation of 44 Sc from the calcium target. Methods: The irradiation of enriched 44 CaCO 3 Isoflex (Russia) was performed with the Scanditronix MC 40 Cyclotron Joint Research Centre (Ispra, Italy). In stack target, 2 mg of enriched CaCO 3 in aluminum foil envelop were used together with Cu disk as beam current monitor. The copper monitor was positioned in entrance of the stack which allowed to have an accurate measurement of the proton beam current by measuring the 44 Sc activity. The stack-foil target was irradiated in aluminum capsules <b>inserted</b> in a <b>holder</b> that allowed direct water cooling from the rear and the front side. Longer-lived 46 Sc was used instead of 44 Sc in the separation procedure. The CaCO 3 target (10 mg) was dissolved in 1 ml of 0. 1 M HCl. Next, the solution was passed through the small column filled with iminodiacetic resin Chelex- 100. After adsorption of 46 Sc the column was washed with 30 ml of 0. 01 M HCl and the effluent containing enriched calcium was collected for further irradiations. The 46 Sc was quantitatively eluted with 1 M HCl in the second 0. 5 ml fraction. Results: The 44 CaCO 3 target was irradiated by protons in the range of 5. 5 - 23 MeV. The analysis of several irradiations indicate that the amount of 44 Sc obtained is maximal with minimal (0. 16 %) 44 mSc impurity in the energy range of 9 - 10 MeV. 46 Sc was separated from the target on iminodiacetic resin with efficiency of more than 95 %, eluted in volume of 0. 5 ml. The recovery of the calcium target is nearly quantitative. The level of Ca 2 + in 46 Sc fraction is less than 3 g/ml. Conclusions: The low-energy irradiation of 44 Ca gives opportunity to produce Ci level activities of 44 Sc. The separation process proposed of 44 Sc from the target is simple and fast. The 44 Sc obtained can be used instead of 68 Ga in PET diagnosis and planning radionuclide receptor therapy [...] Research Support: This work was carried out {{as a part of the}} project of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of Poland DWM/N 166 /COST/ 2007 and COST Action D 38.
