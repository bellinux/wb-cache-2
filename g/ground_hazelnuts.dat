50|$|Berner Haselnusslebkuchen are Lebkuchen - {{traditional}} Christmas cakes - from Berne, Switzerland. Made from <b>ground</b> <b>hazelnuts,</b> {{they are}} {{not to be confused with}} the Berner Honiglebkuchen, another Bernese specialty.|$|E
50|$|Berner Honiglebkuchen are Lebkuchen {{traditionally}} made in Berne, Switzerland. Distinguished {{from other}} Lebkuchen by their sometimes elaborate sugar decorations, {{they are not}} to be confused with the Berner Haselnusslebkuchen, another Bernese specialty which is made from <b>ground</b> <b>hazelnuts.</b>|$|E
50|$|The cuisine {{includes}} many preparations that mix sweet and savoury and stews with sauces based upon botifarra (pork sausage) and the characteristic picada (<b>ground</b> almonds, <b>hazelnuts,</b> pine nuts, etc. sometimes with garlic, herbs, biscuits).|$|R
50|$|Shekerbura (şəkərbura), is an Azerbaijani dessert. It is a sweet pastry, {{filled with}} <b>ground</b> almonds, <b>hazelnuts,</b> or walnuts, and sugar. The dough {{is made of}} wheat flour, butter, milk, egg yolks, cream and yeast. The filling also often {{includes}} cardamom.|$|R
40|$|On a {{model of}} a {{circular}} secondary settling tank the dissertation deals with typical flow structures that establish at twelve different combinations of hydraulic and solids loading. Another variable parameter beside the already mentioned were also solid particles that served as suspended matter. The first group of used particles was fine <b>ground</b> <b>hazelnut</b> shell that was available in two different compositions of grain size; the second group were glass microbeads in three different granulations. Three control experiments were conducted at neutral density conditions by introducing a dye. All experiments were filmed with a digital camera. By processing video clips of experiments an indicator of concentration in the inflow and {{in the vicinity of the}} effluent was captured by photogrammetric approach and data on flow field was obtained by computer-aided flow visualization. A repetition of the first series was carried out in order to collect samples of inflow and outflow suspension. A wide set of experiments with carefully chosen parameters enabled a systematic study of hydrodynamic phenomena in the sedimentation chamber. Flow field and clarification efficiency were found out to be closely related to the value of the densimetric Froude number Frd. All experiments exhibited trends of growing efficiency when values of the densimetric Froude number Frd were decreasing. A three-layer flow structure never occurred when the biggest particle granulation from glass microspheres and when coarse <b>ground</b> <b>hazelnut</b> shell was used. By the rest of the model particles a low value of Frd reflected in a formation of favourable three-layer flow structure, whereas the threshold value of Frd (when the value is exceeded, the three-layer flow does not develop) was independent from the type or size of the particles...|$|R
50|$|Although it tastes, smells, {{and looks}} like chocolate, it does not solidify, even at room temperature. The paste usually {{contains}} cocoa and vegetable or palm oil, and {{is also likely to}} contain milk, sugar and additional flavors. At times, it also includes nuts (e.g., <b>ground</b> <b>hazelnuts)</b> or honey. Chocolate spread is normally sold in glass jars or plastic tubs.|$|E
5000|$|Dobos torte or Dobosh ( [...] , Dobos torta) is a Hungarian {{sponge cake}} layered with {{chocolate}} buttercream {{and topped with}} caramel. [...] The five-layer pastry is named after its inventor, Hungarian confectioner József C. Dobos, who aimed to create a cake that would last longer than other pastries {{in an age when}} cooling techniques were limited. [...] The round sides of the cake are coated with <b>ground</b> <b>hazelnuts,</b> chestnuts, walnuts, or almonds, and the caramel topping helps to prevent drying out.|$|E
50|$|Preparation {{starts with}} the baking of a firm sponge cake in a ring shaped baking tin. The cake is then sliced {{horizontally}} to divide it into two or three rings, and thick layers of buttercream icing are placed between the rings, usually {{with a layer of}} red jam (typically strawberry, blackcurrant or cherry jam). The outside of the cake is then thickly coated with more buttercream and topped with caramel-covered brittle nuts, called Krokant, toasted almond flakes and/or <b>ground</b> <b>hazelnuts.</b> Krokant is signature to this dish.|$|E
50|$|Although {{traditional}} recipe requires minced -raw- meat, {{the version}} in Turkey consumed as fast-food (through small franchise shops in every neighborhood of Turkey) must be meatless by law due to hygienic necessities. Therefore, çiğ köfte is, unless restaurant or home-made, vegan in Turkey. Meat {{is replaced by}} <b>ground</b> walnuts, <b>hazelnuts</b> and potato.|$|R
40|$|Batch {{adsorption}} of Methylene Blue, up to 1000 mg L− 1, and Acid Blue 25, up to 500 mg L− 1, onto <b>ground</b> <b>hazelnut</b> shells was {{studied in}} comparison with sawdust of various species of wood, in order to explore the potential use of this material as low cost adsorbent for dye removal in dyehouse effluents. The adsorption kinetics was investigated according to Lagergren's model, but the best fit was achieved by a second order equation. The equilibrium data were processed according to Langmuir's model and higher adsorption capacity values towards both dyes were shown by hazelnut shells than wood sawdust. Moreover, fixed bed adsorption of Methylene Blue was performed on hazelnut shell columns and the breakthrough curves were determined by varying bed depth, flow rate and influent concentration. The data were processed according to Bohart-Adams model and the column performances could be predicted by the bed depth service time (BDST) approach...|$|R
50|$|Reshteh khoshkar (رشته‌خشکار) is the {{traditional}} cookie for Ramadan in Gilan Province, Iran. It is made of rice flour, and filled with sugar, <b>ground</b> walnuts or <b>hazelnuts,</b> cardamom, cinnamon, ginger and spice, fried in hot oil or fat.|$|R
50|$|The Berner Haselnusslebkuchen {{are made}} of a marzipan-like mass of roasted and <b>ground</b> <b>hazelnuts</b> and about one eighth ground almonds, {{as well as a}} little sugar, honey, cinnamon, candied lemon and orange peel, held {{together}} by egg white. The addition of water or flour is not necessary, as the oil in the hazelnuts helps the mass stick together. The grinding of the hazelnuts requires extensive experience: if ground too hard, the hazelnut oils will liquefy and evaporate during baking, making the Lebkuchen hard like a zwieback.|$|E
50|$|Mässmogge are {{produced}} largely by {{hand in a}} complicated process. The candy mass, made of sugar, glucose and water, is warmed to 134 degrees celsius, agitated {{in order to become}} airy and white, colored and folded into a striped, layered paste. The filling, consisting of roasted and <b>ground</b> <b>hazelnuts</b> with some fat and sugar, is then spread over the candy mass. The paste is wrapped into a 50 kg roll, which is drawn out by a machine to a length of about 2.5 km, and separated into the individual Mässmogge. The whole process must take no more than 25 minutes, {{in order to keep the}} candy mass warm and malleable.|$|E
5000|$|Linzer Torte {{is a very}} short, crumbly pastry made of flour, {{unsalted}} butter, egg yolks, lemon zest, {{cinnamon and}} lemon juice, and <b>ground</b> nuts, usually <b>hazelnuts,</b> but even walnuts or almonds are used, covered with a filling of redcurrant jam or, alternatively, plum butter, thick raspberry, [...] or apricot jam. It is covered by a lattice of dough strips. The dough is rolled out in very thin strips of pastry and arranged to form a criss-cross design {{on top of the}} preserves. The pastry is brushed with lightly beaten egg whites, baked, and sometimes decorated with sliced almonds.|$|R
50|$|Firstly {{the chef}} creates two thin rounds of Japonaise {{meringue}} containing <b>ground</b> almonds and <b>hazelnuts,</b> baked to a light brown colour, and one layer of sponge-cake. For the filling butter cream is prepared, flavoured with kirschwasser and sometimes tinted pink with food colouring (originally beetroot juice). To build the layer cake the buttercream is spread on one round of meringue, {{which is then}} covered with the sponge-cake. The sponge is then soaked {{with a mixture of}} sugar syrup and kirschwasser. Then follows another layer of butter cream topped with the other meringue layer, and finally the whole cake is covered with butter cream, the sides decorated with roasted sliced almonds, and the top given a light dusting of icing sugar.|$|R
