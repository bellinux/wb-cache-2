While African cultures are marginalized by the streamlined information and entertainment menu served by global media conglomerates, the bulk of African children are only spared by the fact that global availability is not synonymous with global affordability. Given Africa’s marginality in global economics, given the limited resources of most African states, and given the enormous costs of cultural production and dissemination, even elite African children who can afford access to national and global media content, are often reduced to consuming media burgers conceived and produced without their particular interests in mind, as even their national media are forced to rely on cheap imports as alternatives to local production. The children are often victims of second-hand consumption even as first-hand consumers, since the media content at their disposal seldom reflects their immediate cultural contexts. They may have qualified as global consumer citizens thanks to the purchasing power of their parents and guardians, but culturally, they remain consumer subjects, and must attune their palates to the diktats of undomesticated foreign media dishes. This is generally the case, despite national and regional broadcasting charters that stress the need for African children to ‘hear, see and express themselves, their culture, their language and their life experiences, through the electronic media which affirm their sense of self, community and place ’ (cf. SADC 1996). Given their tender ages and given the dearth of counter powerful local messages at their disposal in national media, African children are more vulnerable to uncritical internalisation of the explicit or implicit ideological content of the media they consume. The fact of the media not being about or for African children as primary consumers is in a way an implicit statement on the dispensability of their local cultures.

The researcher believes that many aspects of these invitation cards such as organizational structure, content and so forth, may provide a lot of information about the social dimensions of those who tend to hold a wedding ceremony. The data were elicited through a questionnaire that consists of twenty-five items compiled from invitation cards for both Muslims and Christians. The findings of the study show that the organizational structure of the invitation cards in Islam and Christianity in the Jordanian society is systematic and influenced by social, economic, and religious factors. Finally, this study recommends that further research to be conducted investigating other invitation cards for other events in the Jordanian society such as <b>invitation</b> cards <b>fo...</b>|$|R
