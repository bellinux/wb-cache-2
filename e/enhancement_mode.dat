40|$|Transistors {{based on}} {{various types of}} non-silicon {{nanowires}} have shown great potential {{for a variety of}} applications, especially for those require transparency and low-temperature substrates. However, critical requirements for circuit functionality such as saturated source-drain current, and matched threshold voltages of individual nanowire transistors {{in a way that is}} compatible with low temperature substrates, have not been achieved. Here we show that femtosecond laser pulses can anneal individual transistors based on In 2 O 3 nanowires, improve the saturation of the source-drain current, and permanently shift the threshold voltage to the positive direction. We applied this technique and successfully shifted the switching threshold voltages of NMOS based inverters and improved their noise margin, in both depletion and <b>enhancement</b> <b>modes.</b> Our demonstration provides a method to trim the parameters of individual nanowire transistors, and suggests potential for large-scale integration of nanowire-based circuit blocks and systems.

40|$|Aim and Objective: To compare {{conventional}} and direct digital radiography (DDR) in working length {{measurement of the}} root canal and to assess {{the significance of the}} different <b>enhancement</b> <b>modes</b> provided by the software to visualize the file length. Materials and Methods: Access cavities were prepared in 30 extracted maxillary central incisors. Size 15 k-file was introduced into the canal till it was flush with the apical foramen. The working length was calculated as 0. 5 mm less than the vernier caliper measured length of each file. The files were then sealed with resin at their respective lengths. Intraoral periapical radiographs and direct digital radiographs were taken. Vernier caliper was used to measure the file length in the periapical radiographs, and standard, positive conversion, and colorize modes were used with the CDR system. A multiple regression analysis was conducted to give an accurate analysis between the actual file length and the different groups. Results: There was no statistical significance between the different groups tested. The multiple regression analysis test showed that the positive and colorize modes more accurately corresponded to the actual file length. Conclusion: Both conventional radiography and DDR can be reliably used for working length determination. The positive and colorize <b>modes</b> <b>enhancement</b> features of DDR greatly improve the visual perception, leading to more accurate measurements...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{describe}} a spatially {{scalable video coding}} framework in which motion correspondences between successive video frames are exploited in the wavelet transform domain. The basic motivation for our coder is that motion fields are typically smooth and, therefore, can be efficiently captured through a multiresolutional framework. A wavelet decomposition is applied to each video frame and the coefficients at each level are predicted from the coarser level through backward motion compensation. To remove the aliasing effects caused by downsampling in the transform, a special interpolation filter is designed with the weighted aliasing energy {{as part of the}} optimization goal, and motion estimation is carried out with lowpass filtering and interpolation in the estimation loop. Further, to achieve robust motion estimation against quantization noise, we propose a novel backward/forward hybrid motion compensation scheme, and a tree structured dynamic programming algorithm to optimize the backward/forward mode choices. A novel adaptive quantization scheme is applied to code the motion predicted residue wavelet coefficients. Experimental results reveal 0. 3 – 2 -dB increase in coded PSNR at low bit rates over the state-of-the-art H. 263 standard with all <b>enhancement</b> <b>modes</b> enabled, and similar improvements over MPEG- 2 at high bit rates, with a considerable improvement in subjective reconstruction quality, while simultaneously supporting a scalable representation.

50|$|Initially, {{third-party}} software (such as the Bradford printer enhancement program) offered {{a quick fix}} to the quality issue. The software utilized a variety of software techniques to increase print quality; general strategies were doublestrike (print each line twice), and double-density mode (slow the print head to allow denser and more precise dot placement).

5000|$|Depletion-load nMOS {{processes}} {{were also}} used by several other manufacturers to produce many incarnations of popular 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit CPUs. Similarly to early pMOS and nMOS CPU designs using <b>enhancement</b> <b>mode</b> MOSFETs as loads, depletion-load nMOS designs typically employed various types of dynamic logic (rather than just static gates) or pass transistors used as dynamic clocked latches. These techniques can enhance the area-economy considerably although {{the effect on the}} speed is complex. Processors built with depletion-load nMOS circuitry include the 6800 (in later versions), the 6502, Signetics 2650, 8085, 6809, 8086, Z8000, NS32016, and many others (whether or not the HMOS processors below are included, as special cases).|$|E
5000|$|FETs {{are further}} divided into depletion-mode and enhancement-mode types, {{depending}} on whether the channel is turned on or off with zero gate-to-source voltage.

For the depletion mode, the channel is on at zero bias, and a gate potential (of the opposite polarity) can [...] "deplete" [...] the channel, reducing conduction. For either mode, a more positive gate voltage corresponds to a higher current for n-channel devices and a lower current for p-channel devices. Nearly all JFETs are depletion-mode because the diode junctions would forward bias and conduct if they were enhancement-mode devices;most IGFETs are enhancement-mode types.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} colorectal uptake {{of solid}} lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) in mice receiving different doses of 1, 2 -dimethylhydrazine (DMH) using magnetic resonance (MR) and laser-scanning confocal fluorescence microscope (LSCFM) imaging. METHODS: Eight mice were sacrificed {{in a pilot}} study to establish the experimental protocol and to visualize colorectal uptake of SLNs in normal mice. Gadopentetate dimeglumine and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) -loaded SLN (Gd-FITC-SLN) enemas were performed on mice receiving DMH for 10 wk (group 1, n = 9) or 16 wk (group 2, n = 7) and FITC-SLN enema was performed on 4 DMH-treated mice (group 3). Pre- and post-enema MR examinations were made to visualize the air-inflated distal colorectum. Histological and LSCFM examinations were performed to verify colorectal malignancy and to track the distribution of SLNs. RESULTS: Homogeneous enhancement and dense fluorescence (FITC) deposition in colorectal wall were observed in normal mice and 1 DMH-treated mouse (group 1) on fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and LSCFM images, respectively. Heterogeneous mural enhancement was found in 6 mice (4 in group 1; 2 in group 2). No visible mural enhancement was observed in the other mice. LSCFM imaging revealed linear fluorescence deposition along the colorectal mucosa in all groups. Nine intraluminal masses and one prolapsed mass were detected by MR imaging with different <b>enhancement</b> <b>modes</b> and pathologies. Interstitial FITC deposition was identified where obvious enhancement was observed in FLAIR images. Bladder imaging agent accumulations were observed in 11 of 16 DMH-treated mice of groups 1 and 2. CONCLUSION: There are significant differences in colorectal uptake and distribution of SLNs between normal and DMH-treated mice, which may provide a new mechanism of contrast for MR colonography...|$|R
