40|$|Relying {{entirely on}} survey {{information}} and personal exchanges with over 70 scientists {{from within the}} CGIAR network, this working paper attempts to achieve {{a better understanding of}} the scope of social learning related efforts undertaken in CGIAR and main issues of relevance to more current efforts, such as that planned by the CGIAR program on Climate Change Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS). A wide range of methods was identified, where groups of people learn in order to jointly arrive at solutions to pressing food security problems. This methodological diversity is considered a strength given that they represent the different contexts that the research community is responding to. Relying on experiential evidence from professionals within the CGIAR network, the working paper further explores if the reformed CGIAR and the new structural and programmatic setup offer improved prospects for the inclusion of social learning approaches in CCAFS. A range of working definitions of social learning – from the literature – is proposed to meet the special needs/context of scientists. The stocktaking exercise also attempts to identify what is needed to foster an enabling environment for social learning. Key propositions are derived from the findings of the stocktaking exercise. Relying on secondary information provided by respondents, case overviews of exemplary and mature examples of social learning from within CGIAR were developed with the purpose of highlighting that CGIAR does already have a tradition to build upon in future work. Finally, an <b>illustrative</b> <b>listing</b> of current CGIAR projects provided to support the stocktaking objectives of this effort...|$|R

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{examines the}} degree of policy space the WTO leaves its Members to support export credits for non-agricultural goods. In the light of existing case law, it illustrates that export credit support offered by export credit agencies that aims at complementing the private trade finance market would in principle be prohibited under the SCM Agreement. However, while some low-income countries can rely on a specific exception on the prohibition on export subsidies, all WTO Members can, {{on the basis of}} the <b>Illustrative</b> <b>List</b> of Export Subsidies, justify certain subsidized export credits that are in accordance with the interest rate provisions of the OECD Arrangement. But, as the case law and the OECD Arrangement currently stand, subsidized export credit guarantees and insurance as well as subsidized short-term export credits cannot rely on this safe haven. Hence, the article shows that export credit agencies, except for those of some low-income countries, cannot play a complementary role to the private market in offering such support. Moreover, this contribution demonstrates that export credit support in accordance with the safe haven might still be countervailable and actionable. Finally, it is argued that an exception which can be modified by a subgroup of WTO Members, like the safe haven, can no longer be accepted. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about argumentation schemes {{that help to}} deal with {{interactions}} between national and foreign canons of interpretation in private international law cases. In fact, many legal orders, like Italy, require that, in conflict of laws disputes, courts apply the relevant foreign law using canons of interpretation and rules of application of the original foreign system. Our research hypothesis is that, in interpreting the foreign rule, domestic courts incur interpretive divergences of many kinds among the involved legal systems. Foreign law interpretation may result in linguistic and/or conceptual misalignments, in normative and/or interpretive gaps, and in specific incompatibilities between inner and foreign canons of interpretation. By focusing on interpretive conflicts within one legal system, legal theorists and AI and Law scholars have not yet paid sufficient attention to the issue, even if pluralist logics and argumentation have been applied to legal pluralism and conflict of laws. The present study fills this gap in the literature: it explores the feasibility of a theory for arguing and interpreting in private international law contexts, providing an argument-based conceptual framework that encompasses plausible interpretive interactions. To this end, after addressing the epistemic concerns foreign law raises for domestic judges, the thesis gives a definition of cross-border interpretive incompatibilities and proposes argumentation schemes to reason with interpretive canons coming from different legal systems. An <b>illustrative</b> <b>list</b> of critical questions is {{used to evaluate the}} correctness of such interpretive reasoning. Lastly, the thesis presents the first formal developments of the study, based on the concept of meta-argumentation. It is possible to detect two main contributions to knowledge.

Secondly, its argument-based analysis paves the way for further formal applications in the domain of AI and Law...|$|E
40|$|Theme and Scope of the Session Computational Intelligence (CI) {{is widely}} used to face complex modelling, prediction, and {{recognition}} tasks, and is largely addressed in different research fields. One of these, characterized by a mature orientation to market for many years already, is represented by Digital Audio, which finds application in diverse contexts like entertainment, security, and health. Scientists and technicians worldwide actively cooperate to develop new solutions and propose them for commercial exploitation, and, from this perspective, the employment of advanced CI techniques, in combination with suitable Digital Signal Processing algorithms, surely constitutes a plus. In particular, this is typically accomplished {{with the aim of}} extracting and manipulating useful information from the audio stream to pilot the execution of automatized services, also in an interactive fashion. This often happens in conjunction with data coming from other media, like textual and visual, for which specific and application-driven fusion techniques are needed (which also require the involvement of advanced CI algorithms). Several are the Digital Audio topics touched by such a paradigm. In digital music applications we have music transcription, onset detection, genre recognition, just to name a few. Then, moving to speech processing, speech/speaker recognition, speaker diarization, and source separation are surely representative subjects with a florid literature already. Furthermore, auditory scene analysis, acoustic monitoring and sound detection and identification have lately encountered a certain success in the scientific community and can be thus included in this <b>illustrative</b> <b>list.</b> In dealing with the problems correlated to these different topics, the adoption of data-driven learning systems is often a "must". This is not, however, immune to technological issues. Indeed, big amount of data frequently needs to be managed and processed, data which features can change over time due to the time-varying characteristics of the audio stream and of the acoustic environment. Moreover, in many applicative scenarios hard real-time processing constraints must be taken into account. It is indeed of great interest for the scientific community to understand how and to what extent novel CI techniques can be efficiently employed in Digital Audio, in the light of all aforementioned aspects. The aim of this session is therefore to offer a CI oriented look at the large variety of Digital Audio research topics and applications and to discuss the most recent technological efforts from this perspective...|$|E

40|$|This is {{a compact}} review and {{analysis}} of the state of equality law in South Africa. Specific reference is made to what has been called "remedial" or "restitutionary" equality. From the analysis it appears that current equality law shows certain imbalances that are difficult to reconcile with the provisions of the Constitution. To point out shortcomings in equality law which is well intended to resolve the burning problems of inequality, can easily be misunderstood in the contemporary circumstances as a reactionary resistance against a necessary process of a justifiable drive for equality. Such is certainly not the purpose of this review. The intention is however to argue the position that striving for equality must be a balanced process {{in order to ensure that}} the boundaries of equality themselves are not transgressed, since that would contradict the very essence of equality. In the first section the constitutional provisions on equality are briefly described. It is noted that the Constitution does not establish "a right to equality", but that it consistently deals with equality as a value. The wording of section 9 does however justify a term such as "the equality right. " Next the approach of the judiciary to equality, in which the analytical steps of interpretation that were developed by the Constitutional Court are set out, is reviewed with special mention of the role that has been allocated to the value of human dignity in the interpretation and application of equality rights. In the third section an answer is sought to the question what "equality" means. As opposed to the choice of equality jurisprudence in the USA for a formal notion of equality, the South African courts operate with the concept of substantive equality. It is in this context that mention is made of "remedial or restitutionary equality". Equality is given a meaning which implies action. This is supported partly by the wording of sections 1 and 9 (2) of the Constitution, but not by the formulation of sections 7 (1), 9 (1), 36 (1) or 39 (1). The only constitutional provision which imparts meaning directly to the notion of equality, is section 9 (2), providing that "equality includes the full and equal enjoyment of all rights and freedoms. " This gives meaning to equality as a value, to the equality rights and to equality as a description in the Constitution of the nature of the society that is being striven for. The complexity and multi-faceted nature of equality does not allow for a simplistic approach to its meaning. The boundary between equality and inequality is quite sharp and the mobilization of equality for the achievement of political, ideological or pragmatic goals can readily lead to inequality and injustice. Against this background the most important pieces of equality legislation, the Employment Equity Act, 1998 and the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act, 4 of 2000, are discussed. These Acts were adopted "to promote the achievement of equality, legislative and other measures designed to protect or advance persons, or categories of persons, disadvantaged by unfair discrimination" in terms of section 9 (2) of the Constitution. Both however contain provisions that go beyond the scope of the Constitution by e. g. the addition of grounds upon which unfair discrimination is prohibited and by excluding affirmative action measures from the meaning of unfair discrimination. The Constitution can not be interpreted in a manner that would allow unfair discrimination for any purpose. The legislation however seem to disregard the possibility of affirmative action becoming discriminatory in itself. This resonates with the view that "substantive equality" allows for measures "that favour relatively disadvantaged groups at the expense of those who are relatively well off". It is however submitted that not the current ideology behind affirmative action, nor one's preferred understanding of equality or the analytical model that is being used, can determine what the justifiable content of equality law should be: the question is rather what may be justified in law, specifically under the Constitution. The form in which elements of the equality legislation are cast, viz. guidelines for its application and <b>illustrative</b> <b>lists</b> of unfair practices, harbours the danger that uncareful interpreters of the law could be seduced to give precedence to the legislation above the Constitution. This would result in a persecutory application of equality law in terms of examples in stead of the constructive and principled approach required by the Constitution. The equality laws also attempt to extend the list of grounds contained in section 9 (3) of the Constitution upon which discrimination is presumed to be unfair by the addition of HIV status, family responsibility, political opinion, socio-economic status, nationality and family status. The constitutionality of amending section 9 (3) in this manner by means of ordinary legislation is suspect, especially if it is considered that differentiation which is justifiable under the Constitution may be rendered unfair discrimination under ordinary legislation. It is concluded that an emphasis on only the restitutionary element causes a conceptual tension to occur within the multi-faceted notion of equality. This can not be explained only in terms of the distinction between formal and substantive equality, since an over-emphasis of restitution will inevitably bring about imbalances in the outcome of equality actions, i. e. within the framework of striving for substantive equality. Some commentators, courts and the legislature tend to attempt to improve on the Constitution insofar as the achievement of equality is concerned. It is submitted that such attempts are unnecessary, since the Constitution makes sufficient provision for the restitutionary process while the balance of a comprehensive notion of equality is maintained in the form of equality as core value. The limitation of the concept of equality to restitutionary equality will unjustifiably impoverish and partially neutralize the constitutional text. Lessons must in this regard be learnt from the pre-constitutional errors of positivistic legal interpretation...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Development of the {{pedagogical}} toolkit for building national identity of young generation {{has a special}} significance in terms of modern globalization processes that weaken the national unity and national identity of many countries. Present-day Russian multicultural society is in the search of a meaningful content of the new Russian identity, {{which is supposed to}} serve as the basis of the country. In this regard, it is of vital importance to consider the effective experience of national identity development in countries characterized by an extended multicultural structure. The aim of the article is to study, put together and critically assess productive international approaches, methods and technologies for building of university students’ national identity acceptable in the Russian higher education system. Methodology and research methods. The methodology is based on the personal identity theory, the concept of national identity, the theory of ethno-cultural and national stereotypes and the theory of intercultural interaction. To conduct an empirical study, a survey method (questionnaire) and the methodology of content analysis were applied. The research methods used in the study include comparative, historical, and contrastive methods. Results and scientific novelty. The concept «national identity» has no common interpretation because of complexity of the term and rather short history of its use in the Russian pedagogical studies; thus, the authors have clarified the definition. Structural and content-related components of the national identity of students have been stated: cognitive, emotional and behavioral, which correlate with national consciousness, national feelings and nationally-based behavior. Practical methods and technologies that ensure a balanced development of ethnocultural and national components of university students’ national identity have been revealed, systematized and structured: inclusive and activity-oriented approach (USA), inclusive-mosaic approach (Canada), inclusive and value-oriented approach (Australia). Both positive and negative elements are specified in the characteristics of these approaches. Essentially different axiological mental and spiritual values of Russia and West countries are emphasized. It is stated that the best positive foreign experience (e. g. education of an active citizenship, polycultural tolerance, abilities to protect own rights, to interact with representatives of various cultures avoiding conflicts, etc.) appears to be non-contradictory to the specifics of the Russian national system of values, and can become the material for the development of programmes and means selection for building of national identity of young people in the Russian higher education institutions. Practical significance. An integrated pedagogical complex mechanism for building the national identity of students in a multicultural society is revealed. It consists of appealing to the national consciousness, national feelings and the nationally-based behavioral components of national identity through the application of interactive and reflexive multicultural technologies. Interactive and reflexive multicultural technologies contain technologies aimed at transforming the content of education; technologies aimed at multicultural transformation of students’ personalities; technologies for modeling a multicultural environment. An <b>illustrative</b> <b>list</b> of indicators of national identity building as qualities of future experts is provided.  </p...|$|E
40|$|When {{activities}} of a United Nations (UN) peacekeeping operation cause damage to third {{parties and the}} tort claim cannot be settled amicably, the injured third party does {{not have access to}} any remedies that could give effect to the recognized right to compensation. The thesis identifies and analyzes the content of the rules and practices of public international law and the internal law of the UN that give rise to this remedy gap. Further, based on the normative analysis, the thesis constructs and analyzes policy-oriented solutions to how the gap should be closed in order to safeguard the legitimate interests of both the UN and the injured party. Two recent cases related to the cholera epidemic in Haiti and the massacre in Srebrenica are used as case studies. The thesis identifies two principal factors that contribute to the emergence of the remedy gap: inadequacies related to the dispute settlement mechanism of third-party claims in the UN peacekeeping context and the organization's insurmountable immunity from suit before national courts. With regard to the former, the thesis distinguishes between problems related to the devised and actual mechanisms available for settling claims on the one hand, and inadequacies related to the determination of admissibility of tort claims on the other hand. It is submitted that the existing mechanism is inadequate as it leaves outside contentious claims without a legal justification. Further, the determination of admissibility based on the notion 'private-law claims' is uninformative on the international plane. An alternative and more precise model for testing admissibility based on the notion of justiciability is offered: if the standard principles of liability in tort can be determined by the adjudicative forum without having to review political decisions of the UN, tort claims should be receivable. With regard to the latter, the thesis distinguishes between the scope of UN immunity and human rights related arguments commonly used to overcome the bar of unqualified immunity. As regards the former, the thesis argues that lex lata the UN enjoys unqualified immunity due to the impossibility of finding a practicable test for 'functionality', and this immunity can only be lifted by express waiver that cannot be deduced from a commitment to settle disputes. The justification for comprehensive immunities is however greatly diminished where the organization fails to establish alternative modes of dispute settlement. As regards the human rights approach, the thesis analyzes whether the UN can be bound by duties for human rights vis-à-vis the claimants in a peacekeeping context; whether the claimants' right of access to court vis-à-vis the forum state can limit UN immunity; and finally whether a jus cogens hierarchy between immunity and human rights can solve the conflict to the latter's benefit. By applying institutional human rights theory and analyzing relevant case law, the thesis answers all three questions in the negative, and argues that human rights can only play the role of a policy imperative in UN peacekeeping. Linking the conflict between the internal legal order of the UN and the right of access to court to fragmentation, the thesis concludes that the former should accommodate the human rights regime by ensuring the availability of alternative modes of dispute settlement for third party tort claims arising in peacekeeping contexts. Based on the normative analysis, the thesis offers concrete policy recommendations for how the remedy gap should be closed. As for the dispute settlement mechanism, it is submitted that since the majority of tort claims in peacekeeping contexts are settled amicably, a new mechanism is not called for, and the UN should instead incur an obligation to arbitrate contentious cases. It is further submitted that the UN should devise an <b>illustrative</b> <b>list</b> of legal criteria to be applied by the selected adjudicatory forum in determining the admissibility of claims, taking into account the justiciability perspective offered in the study. The legal criteria should also comprehensively set out the applicable law, including internal customary law and general principles of tort law, to be applied to the merits of the claim. The recommendations would effectively remove the remedy gap, avoid the appearance of arbitrariness in the practice related to contentious tort claims, and promote the rule of law within the UN system...|$|E
40|$|The {{transformative}} use standard, {{which is}} {{an important aspect of}} copyright law’s fair use doctrine, has been confusing and uncertain since 1994 when it was first introduced by the United States Supreme Court in Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music. To try to make some sense of this standard, this article extends the work of several scholars who have argued that the massive amount of fair use case law generally divides itself into categories, patterns or policy clusters which have their own internal coherence. This article contends that these observations apply as well to transformative use decisions more particularly, which similarly fit into a number of recurring distinct patterns. The analytic difficulty presented by the transformative use standard is that it is an ambiguous judicial construct layered on top of a pre-existing ambiguous and often criticized legislative construct in the Copyright Act. Section 107 codified the fair use doctrine with an <b>illustrative</b> <b>list</b> of uses which might be fair followed by four general factors to be examined when the fair use defense is raised by an alleged infringer. The determination of whether a particular use is transformative has been added to this multi-factored analysis. The challenge thus becomes relating this judicial construct to the statute’s factors in a meaningful way. Moreover, this standard’s relationship to other copyright law doctrines, especially the right to prepare derivative works, is not clear. After all, a derivative work by definition recasts, transforms, or adapts a preexisting work of authorship. Examining the vast case law in this area suggests initially that judicial results are largely, if not entirely, ad hoc and arbitrary. But lying beneath the chaos, as other scholars contend, is a taxonomy that brings some order. This article’s effort to identify these underlying connections is not, however, simply an effort to produce structure for the sake of structure. The analytic struggle presented by copyright law is of fundamental importance to our jurisprudence more generally because it illustrates the continuing conflict between two competing constitutional doctrines: on one hand, protecting intellectual property and ownership rights as an incentive to create; and, on the other, protecting freedom of expression including a creator’s ability to build upon the works of others. The purpose of copyright is “to encourage people to devote themselves to intellectual and artistic creation” and the philosophy undergirding copyright is the belief that “encouragement of individual effort by personal gain {{is the best way to}} advance public welfare through the talents of authors. ” At the same time, it has long been recognized that few things are “strictly new and original throughout” and that every work “in literature, science and art, borrows, and must necessarily borrow, and use much which was well known, and used before. ” Hence, there is a delicate balance between protecting copyrighted materials and allowing others to build upon those protected works, and it is important to understand how the transformative use standard affects this balance. This article first discusses fair use generally including Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music and the evolution of the transformative use standard. Next it defines the transformative use standard and its relationship to the right to prepare derivative works, and then discusses a dozen categories and subcategories of transformative and non-transformative uses. In some of these categories, such as parody, uses out of context and appropriation art, it finds that a court’s analysis and discussion of whether an unauthorized reproduction of a copyrighted work is transformative performs an important role in explaining why that particular use is or is not a fair use. However, the article suggests that in the fair use categories listed in section 107 ’s preamble, which were well-established before Campbell v. Acuff-Rose was decided such as criticism, comment, news reporting and copying for educational and research purposes, it is unnecessary for courts to turn to the transformative use standard. When it is relatively clear that the challenged use fits within one of those well-established categories, it would be better for the courts to stick with a straight forward analysis using section 107 ’s four factors. This is preferable to trying to twist and turn the transformative use standard to accommodate and explain a challenged use. Otherwise, the transformative use standard will become more presumption-like, implicitly amending section 107. This would also be counter to the Supreme Court’s explicit rejection in Campbell v. Acuff-Rose of using presumptions in fair use analysis. Moreover, in view of the subtle distinction between some allegedly transformative uses and derivative works, the standard’s evolution into a presumption risks undermining the right to prepare derivative works. The standard should not be allowed to eviscerate this right. Like the old productive/nonproductive use distinction discussed by the Supreme Court in the venerable Sony/Betamax decision, analyzing whether a particular use is transformative should be a helpful but not determinative consideration in assessing fair use...|$|E
40|$|THE LIMITATIONS OF RESTITUTIONARY EQUALITYThis is {{a compact}} review and {{analysis}} of the state of equality law in South Africa. Specific reference is made to what has been called "remedial" or "restitutionary" equality. From the analysis it appears that current equality law shows certain imbalances that are difficult to reconcile with the provisions of the Constitution. To point out shortcomings in equality law which is well intended to resolve the burning problems of inequality, can easily be misunderstood in the contemporary circumstances as a reactionary resistance against a necessary process of a justifiable drive for equality. Such is certainly not the purpose of this review. The intention is however to argue the position that striving for equality must be a balanced process {{in order to ensure that}} the boundaries of equality themselves are not transgressed, since that would contradict the very essence of equality. In the first section the constitutional provisions on equality are briefly described. It is noted that the Constitution does not establish "a right to equality", but that it consistently deals with equality as a value. The wording of section 9 does however justify a term such as "the equality right. "Next the approach of the judiciary to equality, in which the analytical steps of interpretation that were developed by the Constitutional Court are set out, is reviewed with special mention of the role that has been allocated to the value of human dignity in the interpretation and application of equality rights. In the third section an answer is sought to the question what "equality" means. As opposed to the choice of equality jurisprudence in the USA for a formal notion of equality, the South African courts operate with the concept of substantive equality. It is in this context that mention is made of "remedial or restitutionary equality". Equality is given a meaning which implies action. This is supported partly by the wording of sections 1 and 9 (2) of the Constitution, but not by the formulation of sections 7 (1), 9 (1), 36 (1) or 39 (1). The only constitutional provision which imparts meaning directly to the notion of equality, is section 9 (2), providing that "equality includes the full and equal enjoyment of all rights and freedoms. " This gives meaning to equality as a value, to the equality rights and to equality as a description in the Constitution of the nature of the society that is being striven for. The complexity and multi-faceted nature of equality does not allow for a simplistic approach to its meaning. The boundary between equality and inequality is quite sharp and the mobilization of equality for the achievement of political, ideological or pragmatic goals can readily lead to inequality and injustice. Against this background the most important pieces of equality legislation, the Employment Equity Act, 1998 and the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act, 4 of 2000, are discussed. These Acts were adopted "to promote the achievement of equality, legislative and other measures designed to protect or advance persons, or categories of persons, disadvantaged by unfair discrimination" in terms of section 9 (2) of the Constitution. Both however contain provisions that go beyond the scope of the Constitution by e. g. the addition of grounds upon which unfair discrimination is prohibited and by excluding affirmative action measures from the meaning of unfair discrimination. The Constitution can not be interpreted in a manner that would allow unfair discrimination for any purpose. The legislation however seem to disregard the possibility of affirmative action becoming discriminatory in itself. This resonates with the view that "substantive equality" allows for measures "that favour relatively disadvantaged groups at the expense of those who are relatively well off". It is however submitted that not the current ideology behind affirmative action, nor one's preferred understanding of equality or the analytical model that is being used, can determine what the justifiable content of equality law should be: the question is rather what may be justified in law, specifically under the Constitution. The form in which elements of the equality legislation are cast, viz. guidelines for its application and <b>illustrative</b> <b>lists</b> of unfair practices, harbours the danger that uncareful interpreters of the law could be seduced to give precedence to the legislation above the Constitution. This would result in a persecutory application of equality law in terms of examples in stead of the constructive and principled approach required by the Constitution. The equality laws also attempt to extend the list of grounds contained in section 9 (3) of the Constitution upon which discrimination is presumed to be unfair by the addition of HIV status, family responsibility, political opinion, socio-economic status, nationality and family status. The constitutionality of amending section 9 (3) in this manner by means of ordinary legislation is suspect, especially if it is considered that differentiation which is justifiable under the Constitution may be rendered unfair discrimination under ordinary legislation. It is concluded that an emphasis on only the restitutionary element causes a conceptual tension to occur within the multi-faceted notion of equality. This can not be explained only in terms of the distinction between formal and substantive equality, since an over-emphasis of restitution will inevitably bring about imbalances in the outcome of equality actions, i. e. within the framework of striving for substantive equality. Some commentators, courts and the legislature tend to attempt to improve on the Constitution insofar as the achievement of equality is concerned. It is submitted that such attempts are unnecessary, since the Constitution makes sufficient provision for the restitutionary process while the balance of a comprehensive notion of equality is maintained in the form of equality as core value. The limitation of the concept of equality to restitutionary equality will unjustifiably impoverish and partially neutralize the constitutional text. Lessons must in this regard be learnt from the pre-constitutional errors of positivistic legal interpretation. Article in Afrikaan...|$|R
