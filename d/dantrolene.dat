5|$|Spasticity: {{spasticity}} {{is characterized}} by increased stiffness and slowness in limb movement, the development of certain postures, an association with weakness of voluntary muscle power, and with involuntary and sometimes painful spasms of limbs. A physiotherapist can help to reduce spasticity and avoid the development of contractures with techniques such as passive stretching. Nabiximols is safe and effective for relieving spacticity. There is evidence, albeit limited, of the clinical effectiveness of baclofen, <b>dantrolene,</b> diazepam, and tizanidine. In the most complicated cases intrathecal injections of baclofen can be used. There are also palliative measures like castings, splints or customized seatings.|$|E
5|$|Further {{treatment}} for other complications such as seizure, hypotension, cardiac abnormalities, pulmonary edema, and acidosis may be required. Increased muscle activity and seizures {{should be treated}} with <b>dantrolene</b> or diazepam; diazepam should only be given with appropriate respiratory support. Hypotension requires treatment with intravenous fluids; vasopressors {{may be required to}} treat myocardial depression. Cardiac dysrhythmias are treated with standard advanced cardiac life support protocols. If severe, metabolic acidosis is treated with sodium bicarbonate. Treatment with sodium bicarbonate is controversial as acidosis may increase tissue oxygen availability. Treatment of acidosis may only need to consist of oxygen therapy. The delayed development of neuropsychiatric impairment {{is one of the most}} serious complications of carbon monoxide poisoning. Brain damage is confirmed following MRI or CAT scans. Extensive follow up and supportive treatment is often required for delayed neurological damage. Outcomes are often difficult to predict following poisoning, especially people who have symptoms of cardiac arrest, coma, metabolic acidosis, or have high carboxyhemoglobin levels. One study reported that approximately 30% of people with severe carbon monoxide poisoning will have a fatal outcome. It has been reported that electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may increase the likelihood of delayed neuropsychiatric sequelae (DNS) after carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dantrolene</b> is {{a muscle}} relaxant {{that appears to}} work {{directly}} on the ryanodine receptor to prevent the release of calcium. After the widespread introduction of treatment with <b>dantrolene,</b> the mortality of malignant hyperthermia fell from 80% in the 1960s to less than 5%. <b>Dantrolene</b> remains the only drug known {{to be effective in}} the treatment of MH. It is recommended that each hospital keeps a minimum stock of 36 <b>dantrolene</b> vials (720mg) sufficient for a 70-kg person.|$|E
25|$|Azumolene is a 30-fold more {{water-soluble}} analog of <b>dantrolene</b> {{that also}} works {{to decrease the}} release of intracellular calcium by its action on the ryanodine receptor. In MH-susceptible swine, azumolene was as potent as <b>dantrolene.</b> It {{has yet to be}} studied in vivo in humans, but may present a suitable alternative to <b>dantrolene</b> in the treatment of MH.|$|E
25|$|The {{hydantoin}} derivative <b>dantrolene</b> is a spasmolytic {{agent with}} a unique mechanism of action outside of the CNS. It reduces skeletal muscle strength by inhibiting the excitation-contraction coupling in the muscle fiber. In normal muscle contraction, calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through the ryanodine receptor channel, which causes the tension-generating interaction of actin and myosin. <b>Dantrolene</b> interferes {{with the release of}} calcium by binding to the ryanodine receptor and blocking the endogenous ligand ryanodine by competitive inhibition. Muscle that contracts more rapidly is more sensitive to <b>dantrolene</b> than muscle that contracts slowly, although cardiac muscle and smooth muscle are depressed only slightly, most likely because the release of calcium by their sarcoplasmic reticulum involves a slightly different process. Major adverse effects of <b>dantrolene</b> include general muscle weakness, sedation, and occasionally hepatitis.|$|E
25|$|Other {{drugs that}} have been used with success include phenytoin, <b>dantrolene,</b> and dimetyl glycine.|$|E
25|$|The {{syndrome}} {{was first}} recognized in Royal Melbourne Hospital, Australia in an affected family by Denborough et al. in 1962. Denborough did {{much of his}} subsequent work on the condition at the Royal Canberra Hospital. Similar reactions were found in pigs. The efficacy of <b>dantrolene</b> as a treatment was discovered by South African anesthesiologist Gaisford Harrison and reported in a 1975 article published in the British Journal of Anaesthesia. After further animal studies corroborated the possible benefit from <b>dantrolene,</b> a 1982 study confirmed its usefulness in humans.|$|E
25|$|The current {{treatment}} of choice is the intravenous administration of <b>dantrolene,</b> the only known antidote, discontinuation of triggering agents, and supportive therapy directed at correcting hyperthermia, acidosis, and organ dysfunction. Treatment must be instituted rapidly on clinical suspicion of the onset of malignant hyperthermia.|$|E
25|$|Muscle relaxants (according to one study) {{were not}} advised for {{orthopedic}} conditions, but rather for neurological {{conditions such as}} spasticity in cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis. <b>Dantrolene,</b> although thought of primarily as a peripherally acting agent, is associated with CNS effects, whereas baclofen activity is strictly associated with the CNS.|$|E
25|$|Vasodilators, such as {{acepromazine}}, {{can help}} improve {{blood flow to}} the muscles. However, the owner should only give acepromazine if it is prescribed by the horse's veterinarian, as it can lower the animal's blood pressure and can cause collapse in a severely dehydrated horse. The human drug <b>dantrolene</b> is sometimes given to alleviate the muscle spasms and prevent further degeneration of muscle tissue.|$|E
25|$|An MH mouse {{has been}} constructed, bearing the R163C {{mutation}} prevalent in humans. These mice display signs similar to human MH patients, including sensitivity to halothane (increased respiration, body temperature, and death). Blockade of RYR1 by <b>dantrolene</b> prevents adverse reaction to halothane in these mice, as with humans. Muscle from these mice also shows increased -induced depolarization {{and an increased}} caffeine sensitivity.|$|E
25|$|Treatment is with <b>dantrolene</b> {{and rapid}} cooling {{along with other}} {{supportive}} measures. The avoidance of potential triggers is recommended in susceptible people. The condition affects one in 5,000 to 50,000 cases where people are given anesthetic gases. Males are more often affected than females. The risk of death with proper treatment is about 5% while without it is around 75%. While cases that appear similar to MH have been documented since the early 20th century, the condition was only formally recognized in 1960.|$|E
25|$|Penicillins may {{decrease}} {{the elimination of}} methotrexate, so {{increase the risk of}} toxicity. While they may be used together, increased monitoring is recommended. The aminoglycosides, neomycin and paromomycin, have been found to reduce gastrointestinal (GI) absorption of methotrexate. Probenecid inhibits methotrexate excretion, which increases the risk of methotrexate toxicity. Likewise, retinoids and trimethoprim have been known to interact with methotrexate to produce additive hepatotoxicity and haematotoxicity, respectively. Other immunosuppressants like ciclosporin may potentiate methotrexate's haematologic effects, hence potentially leading to toxicity. NSAIDs have also been found to fatally interact with methotrexate in numerous case reports. Nitrous oxide potentiating the haematological toxicity of methotrexate has also been documented. Proton-pump inhibitors such as omeprazole and the anticonvulsant valproate have been found to increase the plasma concentrations of methotrexate, as have nephrotoxic agents such as cisplatin, the GI drug colestyramine, and <b>dantrolene.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In the past, the {{prophylactic}} use of <b>dantrolene</b> was recommended for MH-susceptible patients undergoing general anesthesia. However, multiple retrospective {{studies have demonstrated}} the safety of trigger-free general anesthesia in these patients {{in the absence of}} prophylactic <b>dantrolene</b> administration. The largest of these studies looked at the charts of 2214 patients who underwent general or regional anesthesia for an elective muscle biopsy. About half (1082) of the patients were muscle biopsy positive for MH. Only five of these patients exhibited signs consistent with MH, four of which were treated successfully with [...] <b>dantrolene,</b> and the remaining one recovered with only symptomatic therapy. After weighing its questionable benefits against its possible adverse effects (including nausea, vomiting, muscle weakness and prolonged duration of action of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents), experts no longer recommend the use of prophylactic <b>dantrolene</b> prior to trigger-free general anesthesia in MH-susceptible patients.|$|E

2500|$|Most sources {{still use}} the term [...] "centrally acting muscle relaxant". According to MeSH, <b>dantrolene</b> is usually {{classified}} as a centrally acting muscle relaxant.

2500|$|Other {{skeletal}} muscle relaxants {{of that type}} used around the world come {{from a number of}} drug categories and other drugs used primarily for this indication include orphenadrine (anticholinergic), chlorzoxazone, tizanidine (clonidine relative), diazepam, tetrazepam and other benzodiazepines, mephenoxalone, methocarbamol, <b>dantrolene,</b> baclofen, [...] Drugs once but no longer or very rarely used to relax {{skeletal muscle}}s include meprobamate, barbiturates, methaqualone, glutethimide and the like; some subcategories of opioids have muscle relaxant properties, and some are marketed in combination drugs with skeletal and/or smooth muscle relaxants such as whole opium products, some ketobemidone, piritramide and fentanyl preparations and Equagesic.|$|E

5000|$|Although further {{investigation}} is needed, one case report notes that dinitrophenol-induced hyperthermia {{has been successfully}} resolved with <b>dantrolene</b> administration. [...] "Dinitrophenol uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, causes release of calcium from mitochondrial stores and prevents calcium re-uptake.
