25|$|In October 2013, Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner, {{author of}} the Patriot Act, {{introduced}} a proposal to the House of Representatives called the USA Freedom Act to end the bulk collection of Americans' metadata and reform the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court. Senators introduced two different reform proposals. One, the USA Freedom Act (H.R. 3361/ S. 1599), would effectively halt “bulk” records collection under the USA Patriot Act, while <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>would</b> require a warrant to deliberately search for the e-mail and phone call content of Americans that is collected {{as part of a}} surveillance program targeting foreigners located overseas. Another proposal is the FISA Improvements Act that would preserve the program while strengthening privacy protections. It would also codifying the requirement that analysts have a “reasonable articulable suspicion” that a phone number is associated with terrorism to query the NSA phone records database; requiring that the FISA court promptly review each such determination; and limiting the retention period for phone records. Both proposals share the introduction of a special advocate to promote privacy interests before the FISA court.|$|E

25|$|Hatshepsut died {{as she was}} {{approaching}} what we would consider middle age given typical contemporary lifespans, in her twenty-second regnal year. The precise date of Hatshepsut's death—and the time when Thutmose III became the next pharaoh of Egypt—is considered to be Year 22, II Peret day 10 of her reign, as recorded on a single stela erected at Armant or January 16, 1458 BC. This information validates the basic reliability of Manetho's kinglist records since Hatshepsut's known accession date was I Shemu day 4 (i.e.: Hatshepsut died nine months into her 22nd year as king, as Manetho writes in his Epitome for a reign of 21 years and nine months). No contemporary mention of the cause of her death has survived. If the recent identification of her mummy is correct, however, the medical evidence would indicate that she suffered from diabetes and died from bone cancer which had spread throughout her body {{while she was in}} her fifties. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>would</b> suggest that she had arthritis and bad teeth.|$|E

In return, DuMont would get $5 million in cash, guaranteed advertising time for DuMont sets and a secure future for its staff.

500|$|Both Standing and Lamberton assumed Archaeoindris to be a slow-moving tree-dweller like Megaladapis, {{primarily}} due to the misattributed bones.

[...] However, the functional morphology of its hip joint indicates a degree of mobility typically seen in more arboreal animals. [...] Other traits shared with Palaeopropithecus, particularly seen in the femur, suggest that Archaeoindris spent considerable time in the trees for feeding and possibly nesting, although <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>would</b> have visited the ground to feed and travel.

KSTP-TV looked forward to affiliating with the top network, as third-place NBC had been in a long ratings slump. In retaliation for losing ABC, KMSP-TV immediately removed all ABC branding and regularly preempted network programming. Channel 9 then attempted to affiliate with NBC, thinking The Tonight Show would be a good lead-out from their 10 p.m. newscast, despite low prime time ratings. However, NBC, miffed at losing one of its strongest affiliates, and not wanting to pick up ABC's rejects, turned down KMSP's offer almost immediately and signed an affiliation agreement with independent station WTCN-TV.

2500|$|The CAW {{negotiated}} a cost-cutting deal with General Motors Canada on March 8, 2009. The deal would extend the current contract {{for an additional}} year to September 2012, and preserves the current average assembly-worker base pay of about $34 an hour. It would eliminate a $1,700 annual [...] "special bonus," [...] and reduce special paid absences or [...] "SPA days" [...] from two weeks to one week a year, while maintaining vacation entitlements which range up to six weeks a year for high-seniority workers. The deal also introduce payments by members toward their health benefits - $30 monthly per family for workers and $15 a month for pensioners. Lewenza said <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>would</b> trim by 35 per cent company contributions to union-provided programs such as child care and wellness programs. Lewenza called the package a [...] "major sacrifice." [...] However, observers noted that the deal did not go far enough; Dominion Bond Rating Service analyst Kam Hon described it as [...] "not material." [...] Automotive industry consultant Dennis DesRosiers said that General Motors had missed the chance to slash labour costs, pointing out that bankruptcy was a looming threat, Ottawa and Queen's Park demanded cuts to the labour bill {{as a condition of}} the bailout, and that the deficit to the pension fund would prevent the CAW from striking. He estimated the total hourly cost of a GM Canada worker, including benefits, is $75 to $78, and saying that [...] "they [...] got six or seven." [...] when it should have been cut by $20. DesRosiers also said giving up cost-of-living increases is not significant when inflation is nearly non-existent and added that the 40-hour reduction in paid time off merely means [...] "five fewer spa days."

The EFF urged the swift passage of the bill, while Senator Russell Feingold urged the bill be passed as [...] "hese are reasonable and moderate changes to the law. They do not gut the provision. They do not make it worthless. They do recognize the growing and legitimate concern from across the political spectrum that this provision was passed in haste and presents the potential for abuse. They also send a message that fourth amendment rights have meaning and potential violations of those rights should be minimized if at all possible." [...] In Congressional debate, Rick Durbin stated that [...] "many in Congress did not want to deny law enforcement some of the reasonable reforms contained in the PATRIOT Act that they needed to combat terrorism. So, we reluctantly decided to support the administration's version of the bill, but not until we secured a commitment that they would be responsive to Congressional oversight and consult extensively with us before seeking any further changes in the law." ...|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, on July 31, the Protecting the Rights of Individuals Act was {{introduced}} into the Senate by Senators Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and Ron Wyden (D-OR).

[...] The bill proposed a moratorium on data mining by agencies except under specific instances allowed under law and also would have prevented government access to education records without specific facts showing why those records were required in investigations. Further legislation attempting to curtail the Patriot Act {{was introduced}} into the House on September 24 by Dennis Kucinich (D-OH) and Ron Paul (R-TX). That bill was the Benjamin Franklin True Patriot Act, which is an allusion to Benjamin Franklin's famous quote that [...] "those who would give up Essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety." [...] Among other things, it proposed a 90-day review period after which 11 sections of the Patriot Act would cease to have effect. It would have reverted the sections on sneak and peek searches, expansion of pen register and trap and trace authorities as well the authority for the FBI to gain access to records and other tangible items under FISA. Also reverted would have been the sections that changed the primary purpose test for foreign intelligence surveillance under FISA to [...] "significant purpose", the mandatory detention of aliens, the use of National Security Letters and the broadened definition of [...] "domestic terrorism."
