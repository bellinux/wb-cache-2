Released exclusively in Japan on December 23, 1999, it featured a monochrome LCD, a speaker, a real-time clock and infrared communication capability.

5|$|When Zong sailed from Accra with 442slaves on 18August 1781, it {{had taken}} on {{more than twice the}} number of people that it could safely transport. In the 1780s, British-built ships {{typically}} carried 1.75slaves per ton of the ship's capacity; on the Zong, the ratio was 4.0 per ton. A British slave ship of the period would carry around 193slaves and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>extremely</b> unusual for a ship of Zong relatively small size to carry so many.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the wood}} {{recovered}} from the Levels was visually intact, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>extremely</b> degraded and very soft. Where possible, pieces of wood in good condition, or the worked ends of pegs, were taken away and conserved for later analysis. The conservation process involved keeping the wood in heated tanks in a solution of polyethylene glycol and, by a process of evaporation, gradually replacing {{the water in the}} wood with the wax over a period of about nine months. After this treatment the wood was removed from the tank and wiped clean. As the wax cooled and hardened, the artefact became firm and could be handled freely.|$|E
5|$|At this time, {{unhappy with}} the way his {{collection}} The Round Table, issued in the same year, was being promoted by its publisher, he began to promote his new book himself, partly {{by word of mouth}} and also by getting a friend to publish the chapter on Hamlet in The Times and requesting Francis Jeffrey, editor of the Edinburgh Review, to notice it in that periodical. He had already had it printed privately (instead of offering it directly to a publisher) by his friend the printer Carew Henry Reynell, who purchased the copyright for £100. As a publicity tactic, copies were circulated privately. Finally, Hazlitt got the book published, by Rowland Hunter and the brothers Charles and James Ollier in collaboration, who brought it out on 9 July 1817. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>extremely</b> successful, this first edition selling out in six weeks. A second edition was issued by Taylor and Hessey in 1818, and later that year an unlicensed edition was brought out in Boston by Wells and Lilly. No further editions appeared in Hazlitt's lifetime.|$|E

25|$|After the {{dissolution}} of Soviet Union and the switch to the market economy, Russian authors now had to struggle with unfamiliar realities of a free publishing system. The hopes of a creative boom never materialized, as publishers were eager to exploit the lucrative pulp literature market (virtually nonexistent before) largely ignoring the existing literature establishment. This led to rather low confidence in domestic authors, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>extremely</b> {{hard to find a}} publisher ready to invest in a local writer.|$|E

While the union was both profitable and popular, Izod Lacoste's parent company (Crystal Brands, Inc.) was saddled with debt from other business ventures.

25|$|As Muslims {{and other}} peoples {{constantly}} attacked Portuguese fleets in India, and because India {{was so far}} from mainland Portugal, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>extremely</b> difficult for John III to secure Portuguese dominion in this area.
