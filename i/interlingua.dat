25|$|Today, {{interest}} in <b>Interlingua</b> has expanded from {{the scientific community}} to the general public. Individuals, governments, and private companies use <b>Interlingua</b> for learning and instruction, travel, online publishing, and communication across language barriers. <b>Interlingua</b> is promoted internationally by the Union Mundial pro <b>Interlingua.</b> Periodicals and books are produced by many national organizations, such as the Societate American pro <b>Interlingua,</b> the Svenska Sällskapet för <b>Interlingua,</b> and the Union Brazilian pro <b>Interlingua.</b>|$|E
25|$|Impressed by Peano's <b>Interlingua,</b> the Akademi Internasional de Lingu Universal {{effectively}} {{chose to}} abandon Idiom Neutral {{in favor of}} Peano's <b>Interlingua</b> in 1908, and it elected Peano as its director. The name of the group then was changed to Academia pro <b>Interlingua</b> (where <b>Interlingua</b> stands for Peano's language). The Academia pro <b>Interlingua</b> survived until about 1939. It was partly Peano's <b>Interlingua</b> that inspired the better-known <b>Interlingua</b> presented in 1951 by the International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA).|$|E
25|$|In {{the context}} of <b>Interlingua,</b> an Anglicism is a uniquely English {{expression}} used when speaking or writing <b>Interlingua.</b> Many English expressions have penetrated into {{a wide variety of}} languages, making them good <b>Interlingua</b> expressions. Novice speakers sometimes assume that an English expression is correct <b>Interlingua</b> when in fact it is not sufficiently international. For example, a novice may use Lassa nos considerar le optiones to mean 'Let's consider the options', as in English. In <b>Interlingua,</b> however, this expression means 'Permit us to consider the options'. A more international expression is Que nos considera le optiones, literally 'That we consider the options'.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An {{efficient}} use of the web will imply the ability to find not only documents but also specific pieces of information according to user’s query. Right now, this last possibility is not tackled by current information extraction or question answering systems, since it requires both a deeper semantic understanding of queries and contents along with deductive capabilities. In this paper, the authors propose the use of <b>Interlinguas</b> as a plausible approach to search and extract specific pieces of information from a document, given the semantic nature of <b>Interlinguas</b> and their support for deduction. More concretely, the authors describe the UNL <b>Interlinguas</b> from the representational {{point of view and}} illustrate its deductive capabilities by means of an example. ...|$|R
25|$|<b>Interlingua</b> had {{attracted}} many former adherents of other international-language projects, notably Occidental and Ido. The former Occidentalist Ric Berger founded The Union Mundial pro <b>Interlingua</b> (UMI) in 1955, {{and by the}} late 1950s, interest in <b>Interlingua</b> in Europe {{had already begun to}} overtake that in North America.|$|E
25|$|<b>Interlingua</b> has {{detached}} {{itself from}} the movement for the development and introduction of a universal language for all humanity. Whether or not one believes that a language for all humanity is possible, whether or not one believes that <b>Interlingua</b> will become such a language is totally irrelevant {{from the point of}} view of <b>Interlingua</b> itself. The only fact that matters ({{from the point of view}} of <b>Interlingua</b> itself) is that <b>Interlingua,</b> thanks to its ambition of reflecting the cultural and thus linguistic homogeneity of the West, is capable of rendering tangible services at this precise moment in the history of the world. It is by its present contributions and not by the promises of its adherents that <b>Interlingua</b> wishes to be judged.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} is a rough sketch of Idiom Neutral grammar. It does not lay out every detail of grammar worked out for the language. The simple grammar of Idiom Neutral is similar to <b>Interlingua's.</b>|$|R
50|$|When Martinet {{took up a}} {{position}} at Columbia University in 1948, Gode took on the last phase of <b>Interlingua's</b> development. His task was to combine elements of Model M and Model P; take the flaws seen in both by the polled community and repair them with elements of Model C as needed; and simultaneously develop a vocabulary.|$|R
25|$|A {{reformed}} <b>Interlingua</b> {{was presented}} in 1951 by Alexander Gode as the last director of the International Auxiliary Language Association. It was claimed to be independent from Peano’s <b>Interlingua,</b> because it had developed a new method to detect the most recent common prototypes. But that method usually leads to the Latin ablative, so most vocabulary of Peano’s <b>Interlingua</b> would be kept. Accordingly, the very name <b>Interlingua</b> was kept, yet a distinct abbreviation was adopted: IA instead of IL.|$|E
25|$|In Czechoslovakia, Július Tomin {{published}} his first article on <b>Interlingua</b> in the Slovak magazine Príroda a spoločnosť (Nature and Society) in 1971, {{after which he}} received several anonymous threatening letters. He {{went on to become}} the Czech <b>Interlingua</b> representative, teach <b>Interlingua</b> in the school system, and publish a series of articles and books.|$|E
25|$|An early {{practical}} application of <b>Interlingua</b> was the scientific newsletter Spectroscopia Molecular, published from 1952 to 1980. In 1954, <b>Interlingua</b> was {{used at the}} Second World Cardiological Congress in Washington, D.C. for both written summaries and oral interpretation. Within a few years, it found similar use at nine further medical congresses. Between the mid-1950s and the late 1970s, some thirty scientific and especially medical journals provided article summaries in <b>Interlingua.</b> Science Service, the publisher of Science Newsletter at the time, published a monthly column in <b>Interlingua</b> from the early 1950s until Gode's death in 1970. In 1967, the International Organization for Standardization, which normalizes terminology, voted almost unanimously to adopt <b>Interlingua</b> {{as the basis for}} its dictionaries.|$|E
50|$|Both {{languages}} {{make use}} of an objective procedure to identify international words for their lexicons. <b>Interlingua’s</b> procedure identifies a prototype that is common to {{the various forms of}} a word in its source languages, and its control languages are selected to increase the internationality of its vocabulary. Since their vocabularies are very similar, it is likely that both languages possess an internationality that extends beyond the Western language families.|$|R
40|$|For as long {{as there}} has been {{interest}} in knowledge based systems there has been interest in sharing formally expressed knowledge. It is traditional for this to require a high degree of social interaction between the suppliers and recipients of such information but the Internet has brought with it an interest in more opportunistic, semi-automatic cooperation between systems. This raises a variety of technical problems relevant to logic programming. We discuss these - concentrating on the use of protocols and <b>interlinguas...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Both {{languages}} {{attempt to}} be as precise as possible; that is, each strives to reflect differences in meaning using different words. Interlinguists sometimes claim, however, that Esperanto's system of word formation sometimes causes ambiguity. The Esperanto compound mal-san-ul-ej-o, literally [...] "un-healthy-person-place-noun", implies a place {{for people who are}} unhealthy. The word means [...] "hospital", but the compound could be construed as any place where an unhealthy person is. <b>Interlingua's</b> non-compound word, though possibly less neutral, thus avoids any misunderstanding. (Depending on the speaker and audience, Esperanto could also use a different word for [...] "hospital", such as hospitalo, kliniko, lazareto, preventorio or sanatorio.) ...|$|R
25|$|The IALA {{closed its}} doors in 1953 but was not {{formally}} dissolved until 1956 or later. Its role in promoting <b>Interlingua</b> was largely taken on by Science Service, which hired Gode as head of its newly formed <b>Interlingua</b> Division. Hugh E. Blair, Gode's close friend and colleague, became his assistant. A successor organization, the <b>Interlingua</b> Institute, was founded in 1970 to promote <b>Interlingua</b> in the US and Canada. The new institute supported the work of other linguistic organizations, made considerable scholarly contributions and produced <b>Interlingua</b> summaries for scholarly and medical publications. One of its largest achievements was two immense volumes on phytopathology produced by the American Phytopathological Society in 1976 and 1977.|$|E
25|$|Words do {{not enter}} the <b>Interlingua</b> {{vocabulary}} solely because cognates exist in {{a sufficient number of}} languages. If their meanings have become different over time, they are considered different words for the purpose of <b>Interlingua</b> eligibility. If they still have one or more meanings in common, however, the word can enter <b>Interlingua</b> with this smaller set of meanings.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not certain}} {{how many people have}} an active {{knowledge}} of <b>Interlingua.</b> As noted above, <b>Interlingua</b> is claimed to be the most widely spoken naturalistic auxiliary language.|$|E
50|$|Initially, {{this view}} of an Anglo-Romance {{productive}} sphere permitted the researchers of IALA to greatly simplify the derivation of the international vocabulary. They could omit research into the receptive sphere, {{because all of the}} words that the languages of this sphere held in common were taken from the productive sphere. For example, Dutch and Hungarian have little in common, being of different language families, except for variations of many thousands of Greco-Latin international words such as information, international, and politics. These words are already found in the productive sphere. Thus, the addition of Dutch and Hungarian to <b>Interlingua's</b> control languages would not affect the resulting vocabulary.|$|R
40|$|Unorganised or {{informal}} sector constitutes a pivotal {{part of the}} Indian economy. More than 90 per cent of workforce and about 50 per cent of the national product are {{accounted for by the}} informal economy. A high proportion of socially and economically underprivileged sections of society are concentrated in the informal economic activities. The high levels of growth of the Indian economy {{during the past two decades}} are accompanied by increasing in formalisation. There are indications of growing <b>interlinguas</b> between informal and formal economic activities. There has been new dynamism of the informal economy in terms of output, employment and earnings. Faster and inclusive growth needs special attention to informal economy. The rural non-farm economy (RNFE) may be viewed as all those activities associated with waged work or self-employment in income- generating activities that are not agricultural, but located in rural areas (Davis, 2006) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We are {{presenting}} {{a description of}} the UNL initiative based on the Universal Networking Language (UNL). This language was conceived to be the support of the multilingual communication on the Internet beyond the linguistic barriers. This initiative was launched by the Institute of Advanced Studies of the United Nations University in 1996. The initial consortium was formed to support 15 languages. Eight years later, this initial consortium changed, many components and resources were developed, and the UNL language itself evolved to be the support of different type of applications from the multilingual generation to the “knowledge repositories ” or cross lingual information retrieval applications. We describe the main features of the UNL Language making a comparison with some similar approaches like <b>interlinguas.</b> We also describe some organizational and managerial aspects of the UNL according the criteria of quality and maturity, putting emphasis on the open character of the initiative for any interested group or researcher. ...|$|R
40|$|Workflows are {{increasingly}} used {{to manage and}} share scientific computations and methods. Workflow tools {{can be used to}} design, validate, execute and visualize scientific workflows and their execution results. Other tools manage workflow libraries or mine their contents. There {{has been a lot of}} recent work on workflow system integration as well as common workflow <b>interlinguas,</b> but the interoperability among workflow systems remains a challenge. Ideally, these tools would form a workflow ecosystem such that it should be possible to create a workflow with a tool, execute it with another, visualize it with another, and use yet another tool to mine a repository of such workflows or their executions. In this paper, we describe our approach to create a workflow ecosystem through the use of standard models for provenance (OPM and W 3 C PROV) and extensions (P-PLAN and OPMW) to represent workflows. The ecosystem integrates different workflow tools with diverse functions (workflow generation, execution, browsing, mining, and visualization) created by a variety of research groups. This is, to our knowledge, the first time that such a variety of workflow systems and functions are integrated...|$|R
40|$|This article {{raises an}} issue of common {{interest}} to those interested in <b>Interlinguas</b> and interlingual MT and those interested in developing a multilingual FrameNet. Specifically, it addresses the problem of teasing apart the difference between meaning and interpretation, between semantics and pragmatics and between semantic representation and the representation of conveyed information. No translation (nor paraphrase) conveys the exactly same information as the original utterance. Rather, additional information may be conveyed or information may be lost, and information originally expressed explicitly may be conveyed implicitly and vice versa. The semantic representation of an utterance (the result of integrating the semantic representations of the it subcomponents) does not capture what people intuitively feel {{is the meaning of}} an utterance but rather various pragmatic factors {{must be taken into account}} as well including the time and place of utterance and the speaker’s motivation for uttering. The focus of the discussion is on describing IAMTC, a multi-site NSF-supported project to annotate six sizable bilingual parallel corpora for interlingual content. After setting out the basic issues, we present the background and objectives of the IAMTC annotation effort, the dataset being annotated, the interlingual representation language used, the annotator’s interface and annotation process itself, along with the evaluation methodology and results o...|$|R
25|$|The {{vocabulary}} of both languages is taken largely from Romance, Germanic and Slavic languages; {{most of these}} words are derived from Latin. Depending on their international form, Germanic and Slavic words in <b>Interlingua</b> may be Latinized; for example, English blockade, German Blockade, Russian блокада → <b>Interlingua</b> blocada. By comparison, all words in Esperanto take on a characteristic Esperanto form. In this case, the <b>Interlingua</b> blocada and the Esperanto blokado are nearly identical and equally neutral.|$|E

For this purpose, browsing quality is sufficient, since the user has in-telligence and good will, and understands that she uses the translation at her own risk. Since Google and Systran translations can be gram-matically and semantically flawed, they don’t reach publication quality, and cannot hence be used by the producers of web documents.

40|$|Nuruddin Farah’s Secret, {{the third}} in a suite of three novels called ‘Blood in the Sun,’ was written in Berlin in 1990. It was {{originally}} dubbed ‘Awake, When Asleep,’ an evangelical plea for social and political redemption whose idealism Farah did not walk out on but camouflaged under an uncompromising exploration. Somalia had become a nightmare and has stayed a life-long trauma for Farah himself. With the Wall collapsing outside the windows at Potsdamer Platz and the jubilant demonstrators’ catch phrase "We are the people" metamorphosing into "We are ONE people,” the novel’s title and language changed. Farah’s documentation of the collective horror of Somalia in decay, the converse of German unity (as it seemed), could only be searched through a radical literary diagnosis that shattered ‘normalcies’ that bound together family-clan, man-woman, right-wrong, sanity-insanity, God-gods-fathoms. Farah deconstructs, unveils, ruthlessly the mechanisms of patrilineal genetics, patronymics, rape, blood binds, foster children, down to their minutest, most mazelike particulars; even the <b>interlinguas</b> of animals. All is made transcendent. This is what the ‘secrets’ connote. Cultural taboos and religious codes of loyalty, normalcies, kill. In monologues, all the five narrators, Kaaman, Sholoongo, Yaqut, Damac and Nonno, tell stories about themselves, about each other. They do it through fables, innuendos, whispers, wrong-sayings, rumors, lies, voyeurism. As readers we have to endure Farah’s fragmented world, simply for it to make sense for us. To achieve this, his fable tells us, {{we have to understand}} that there is no secret if life is here to be lived. That the collective mystery of Somalia is a lie: no one understands why someone shoots another human being; why you eat locusts; that no one knows that God does not exist. Now, a quarter of a century later, dysfunctional Somalia is still there, unchanged, but so also, increasingly, the out of Somalia world, from Damascus in the east to Berlin and Stockholm in the north.
