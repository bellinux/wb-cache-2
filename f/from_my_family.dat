Gore stated: [...] "I would like to be President. But I am also a father, and I feel deeply about my responsibility to my children. I didn't feel right about tearing myself away <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>family</b> to the extent that is necessary in a Presidential campaign." [...] During this time, Gore wrote Earth in the Balance, a text which became the first book written by a sitting U.S. Senator to make The New York Times Best Seller list since John F. Kennedy's Profiles in Courage.|$|E
500|$|In March 2011, Aronofsky bowed out of {{directing}} the film, {{saying in a}} statement, [...] "As I talked more about the film with my collaborators at Fox, {{it became clear that}} the production of The Wolverine would keep me out of the country for almost a year.... I was not comfortable being away <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>family</b> for that length of time. I am sad that I won't be able to see the project through, as it is a terrific script and I was very much looking forward to working with my friend, Hugh Jackman, again". Fox also decided to be [...] "in no rush" [...] to start the production due to the damage incurred in Japan by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. Despite this, Jackman said the project was moving ahead. [...] "It's too early to call on Japan, I'm not sure where they're at. So now we're finding another director, but Fox is very anxious to make the movie and we're moving ahead full steam to find another director".|$|E
500|$|After {{three years}} with Celtic, in July 2004, Nécib was {{selected}} to attend the CNFE academy at Clairefontaine. She initially struggled to adapt at the center admitting [...] "the first year was really hard because I was so far <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>family.</b> I almost gave up". However, after developing a rapport with future international teammates Sarah Bouhaddi, Élodie Thomis, Laure Boulleau, Jessica Houara, and the aforementioned Pizzala, Nécib quickly returned to the form that got her selected to the center. The CNFE academy is allowed participation in the French women's football league system and, from 2002–2007, fielded a team that participated in the Division 1 Féminine. Nécib spent two seasons with the team and made her league debut on 29 August 2004 against Lyon. In the match, she scored the only goal, a 90th-minute winner, in a 1–0 win. Nécib finished the campaign with 20 league appearances and six goals. Four of her six goals came {{in the final four}} weeks of the season. On 26 March 2005, she scored a double in a 4–2 defeat to Juvisy. A week later, she scored the only goal in a win over Olympique Saint-Memmie and, on the final match day of the season, she scored the team's fourth goal in a 5–1 win over Lyon. CNFE ultimately finished the campaign in 5th-place position. In the following season, Nécib appeared in 18 matches and scored three goals, all of which came in victories.|$|E

2500|$|Banville {{was educated}} at CBS Primary, Wexford, a Christian Brothers school, and at St Peter's College, Wexford. Despite having {{intended}} to be a painter and an architect, he did not attend university. Banville has described this as [...] "A great mistake. I should have gone. I regret not taking that four years of getting drunk and falling in love. But I wanted to get away <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>family.</b> I wanted to be free." [...] Alternately he has stated that college would have had little benefit for him: [...] "I don't think I would have learned much more, and I don't think I would have had the nerve to tackle some of the things I tackled as a young writer if I had been to university — I would have been beaten into submission by my lecturers." [...] After school he worked as a clerk at Aer Lingus, which allowed him to travel at deeply discounted rates. He took advantage of this to travel in Greece and Italy. He lived in the United States during 1968 and 1969. On his return to Ireland, he became a sub-editor at The Irish Press, rising eventually to the position of chief sub-editor.|$|E

5000|$|On the {{influence}} of artist Harold Balazs: “Sometimes you just luck out in life and you meet a force of nature.

A sculptor and humanitarian, Harold instilled in my youth a sense of courage and enthusiasm to embrace this lucky moment we have on earth. As a kid I watched fantastic sculptures being fabricated at his shop and home in Mead, Washington. I witnessed his experiments and ideas with different medium and materials and how all of it related to the culture and politics of our time. He said to {{me out of the}} blue: ‘If you want to see what art can be, look at hot rods.’ This was around 1968. The point he was making was they were challenging the status quo and re-inventing the commodities with their own ideas and craft. He saw their craft as an incredible source of inspiration for his work, and that left a lasting impression.” ...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 99 - 101) This thesis {{explores the}} influences {{and values that}} formed my identity. My identity is based on experiences stemming <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>family???s</b> Oaxacan-Mexican background {{and the fact that}} I was born, raised and educated in the United States. The dynamic conflicts between the two worlds I navigate on a daily basis have created a quagmire of experiences. On one side, my parents??? culture, values, traditions and customs, and the restrictions American life and society places on them. On the other lies the influence of American life, consumption of media and to some extent, the restrictions placed on it by <b>my</b> <b>family.</b> Furthermore, depression, anxiety and emotional disconnect that have been created or magnified due, in part, to these conflicts. These factors intertwine daily and forge my identity. As I arrived at the decision to write about these experiences, I was influenced by the writings of Octavio Paz, Richard Rodriguez, Roland Barthes and Terry Eagleton. Their writings and insights on culture, and the deconstruction of culture, have allowed me to look at myself through a different lens. These readings have framed my exploration by addressing: the duality of my identity, the meaning of signs and the influence of the media I consume...|$|R
