40|$|Graduation date: 1993 Food {{tampering}} in foodservice facilities, {{especially with}} self-serve foods, {{can result in}} consumer illness or injury and adversely affect the foodservice organization. This study explored foodservice managers' awareness and perceptions of risk and evaluated a Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) -based program of food tampering hazard reduction developed for managers. The study had two phases, descriptive and experimental. The purpose of phase one was to determine food tampering awareness and opinions, to obtain descriptive information about foodservice managers and their facilities, and to identify the population for phase two. The purpose of phase two was to evaluate an educational workbook, which had been developed by the researcher, using a post-test for the experimental and control samples. One thousand foodservice managers in commercial and non-commercial foodservices were contacted by mailed questionnaires in phase one; 376 continued on to phase two, one-half received both a food tampering risk reduction self-instructional workbook and a post-test; 238 completed the study. The post-test included a food tampering hazard <b>inspection</b> <b>form</b> used to evaluate facilities. The managers' changes in opinions and actions to reduce food tampering hazards and their understanding of a HACCP-based program were identified and comparisons made through chi square analyses. More non-commercial foodservice managers than commercial managers had college degrees, {{but there was no}} significant association between education level and food tampering concern. Managers with self-serve foods reported greater concern than those without; managers aware of food tampering reported greater concern. Managers who had received the self-instructional workbook had greater ability to identify food tampering hazards through floor plan evaluation. No significant changes in food tampering concern or intent to take action to reduce risk were found after the post-test. However, increased awareness led to a trend of increased concern. It was concluded that the questionnaire and post-test both had educational effects on the participants. The workbook and the <b>inspection</b> <b>form</b> are suggested as an educational program to increase awareness and concern for food tampering and the intent to reduce food tampering hazards by foodservice managers...|$|E

40|$|Eight-year-old Greyson Yoe was {{electrocuted}} {{while waiting}} {{to get on the}} 2 ̆ 2 Scooters 2 ̆ 2 bumper car ride at the Lake County Fair in northeastern Ohio. The failure to ground the ride structure and damage to a light fixture on the ride caused his death. The day before the electrocution, two inspectors from the Ohio Department of Agriculture (ODA) inspected the ride and passed it as 2 ̆ 2 safe to operate. 2 ̆ 2 That inspection was superficial and grossly inadequate, and the completed <b>inspection</b> <b>form</b> had serious misrepresentations. Indeed, the inspectors later admitted that they never reviewed the key electrical items that they checked off on the <b>inspection</b> <b>form.</b> The post-electrocution review not only showed that the electrical system had gross safety problems but also that the ride 2 ̆ 7 s management and operators knew of and ignored these problems. This Article is about the response of the responsible authority, the ODA, to the civil and criminal actions brought or promised against it and its employees. The ODA appears to have chosen to protect itself and its employees by getting out of the business of protecting the public from similar electrical hazards. Such actions, under a prominent theory regarding the foundations of tort and criminal law, are predictable and unsurprising. Further, the ODA 2 ̆ 7 s acts should call into question certain assumptions about the incentives created by criminal and tort law. Traditional tort and criminal law jurisprudence assume that the potential for, and reality of, civil or criminal liability changes behavior. In particular, many scholars contend that liability makes the injuries or harms caused by a violation of tort or criminal law standards less likely to occur in the future by way of what is sometimes called 2 ̆ 2 specific deterrence 2 ̆ 2 {{in the case of the}} individual defendant or 2 ̆ 2 general deterrence 2 ̆ 2 in the case of others. This Article explores one instance of what may be a broader problem for such deterrence theory: a defendant who controls the standards by which it is judged, in an age of tight budgets and financial pressures, where government is expected to operate 2 ̆ 2 like a business. 2 ̆ 2 In that scenario, incentives can combine to make the situation post-litigation more dangerous rather than less dangerous...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDeep packet <b>inspection</b> <b>forms</b> the {{backbone}} of any Network Intrusion Detection (NID) system. It involves matching known malicious patterns against the incoming traffic payload. Pattern matching in software is prohibitively slow in comparison to current network speeds. Thus, only FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) or ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) solutions could be efficient for this problem. Our FPGA-based solution performs high-speed matching while permitting pattern updates without resource reconfiguration. An off-line optimization method first finds sub-pattern similarities across all the patterns in the SNORT database of signatures [17]. A novel technique then compresses each pattern into a bit vector where each bit represents such a sub-pattern. Our approach reduces drastically the required on-chip storage {{as well as the}} complexity of matching, utilizing just 0. 05 logic cells for processing and 17. 74 bits for storage per character in the current SNORT database of 6456 patterns...|$|R

30|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the standard values of living, undamaged iron-wood (Casuarina equisetifolia) trees by different nondestructive techniques. This study also detects the transversal stress wave velocity (V) and tomogram, and resolves corresponding V maps of the trees with and without decay damage. First, a visual tree <b>inspection</b> <b>form</b> with seven categories of tree defects is proposed for tree hazard assessment. The range of demarcation between decay-damaged and sound wood occurred at an approximate V of 1461 – 1636  m/s by transversal stress wave velocity tomography. Different nondestructive evaluation parameters can serve as an index for diagnosing standard values (with or without decay). A positive significant relationship was found between the diameter and transversal minimum V of 2 D in undamaged trees. Moreover, the product diameter × frequency of evaluated value by lateral impact vibration method tended to increase with increasing minimum V of 2 D using tomography in undamaged and decay-damaged trees. Decay damage in iron-wood living trees could be inspected and detected by lateral impact vibration method and transversal stress wave velocity tomography for the general location and area of wood deterioration.|$|E
40|$|To {{analyze the}} {{association}} between the results of routine inspections and foodborne outbreaks in restaurants, we conducted a matched case-control study using available data from Seattle-King County, Washington. Case restaurants were facilities with a reported foodborne outbreak between January 1, 1986 and March 31, 1987 (N = 28). Two control restaurants with no reported outbreaks during this period were matched to each case restaurant on county health district and date of routine inspection (N = 56). Data from the routine inspection that preceded the outbreak (for case restaurants) or the date-matched routine inspection (for control restaurants) were abstracted from computerized inspection records. Case restaurants had a significantly lower mean inspection score (83. 8 on a 0 to 100 point scale) than control restaurants (90. 9). Restaurants with poor inspection scores and violations of proper temperature controls of potentially hazardous foods were, respectively, five and ten {{times more likely to}} have outbreaks than restaurants with better results. Although this study demonstrates that Seattle-King County's routine <b>inspection</b> <b>form</b> can successfully identify restaurants at increased risk of foodborne outbreaks, it also illustrates that more emphasis on regulation and education is needed to prevent outbreaks in restaurants with poor inspection results...|$|E
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this thesis was to design and create an Interactive Audit to conduct Environmental Site Assessments {{according}} to American Society of Testing Material 2 ̆ 7 s (ASTM) Phase I Standards at the Wagner Creek study area. ArcPad and ArcIMS are the major software {{that were used to}} create the model and ArcGIS Desktop was used for data analysis and to export shapefile symbology to ArcPad.
