5000|$|This cartoon is {{made using}} the cut-out technique, similar to South Park, {{as well as}} tradidional {{hand-drawn}} animation. Most of the cartoon features cut-outs. Some of the puppet animation techniques were also applied, for example rather than drawing ropes, pieces of real thread was used and it was stop-motion-animated; rather than <b>drawing</b> <b>soap</b> bubbles, animators used soap water / shaving cream on a glass, which they moved around frame-by-frame.|$|E
25|$|Emmerdale Farm {{was renamed}} Emmerdale in 1989. The series was revamped in 1993 with many changes {{executed}} via {{the crash of}} a passenger jet that partially destroyed the village and killed several characters. This attracted criticism as it was broadcast near {{the fifth anniversary of}} the Lockerbie bombing. The storyline <b>drew</b> the <b>soap</b> its highest ever audience of 18 million viewers. The revamp was a success and Emmerdale grew in popularity.|$|R
2500|$|By {{the time}} the {{regiment}} reached Corinth, Mississippi, in early 1862, the 33rd was keeping [...] "three days cooked rations in our haversacks of flour or cornbread, crackers, rice, pickled pork, fresh or pickled beef, salt, syrup, sweet potatoes, and <b>drew</b> some <b>soap</b> once a week." [...] "Cattle, hogs, sheep or goats," [...] said Matthews, [...] "were either driven or shipped to us on [...] cars, and usually butchered {{on the banks of}} a creek into which the offal was dumped." [...] He writes of men wrapping fish they had caught in green leaves, then roasting them in the ashes of their campfires, together with sweet potatoes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first season}} {{received}} critical acclaim. Metacritic gave the show {{a rating of}} 84 out of 100 or [...] "universal acclaim" [...] based on 32 reviews. As of October 2014, season one has a rating of 92% based on 48 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. Season one was {{called one of the}} most exciting new series of the season. The consensus on Rotten Tomatoes reads [...] "Nashville promotes catchy pop-western tunes and plays to non-fans of the genre with its sharp atmosphere and its stellar narratives." [...] Alan Sepinwell stated that the series was [...] "a smart mix of soap opera, music and political intrigue." [...] The series <b>drew</b> more <b>soap</b> comparison, with David Hiltbrand drawing comparisons to hit-soap, Dynasty, and praising the dynamic of leads Rayna, and Juliette. Britton received critical acclaim for her performance.|$|R
25|$|The series follows an {{investigation}} headed by FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) into {{the murder of}} homecoming queen Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) in the fictional town of Twin Peaks, Washington. The narrative draws on elements of crime drama, but its uncanny tone, supernatural elements, and campy, melodramatic portrayal of eccentric characters also <b>draw</b> on American <b>soap</b> opera and horror tropes. Like much of Lynch's work, it is distinguished by surrealism and offbeat humor, as well as distinctive cinematography. The show's acclaimed score was composed by Angelo Badalamenti in collaboration with Lynch.|$|R
50|$|George Bell (4 March 1861 - May 1959) was an English {{football}}er {{who played}} at outside left. He was born in West Bromwich and worked at the local George Salter's Spring Works. Bell {{was one of the}} founders of the factory's football team, the West Bromwich Strollers, and played in the team's first recorded match, a 0-0 <b>draw</b> against Hudson's <b>soap</b> factory on 23 November 1878. He continued to play for the team following their change of name to West Bromwich Albion in 1879, playing alongside his cousin Harry Bell on several occasions.|$|R

40|$|Experiments {{carried out}} onboard NASA 2 Ì† 7 s KC- 135 {{aircraft}} {{to better understand}} the role of surfactant in liquid films are described. Liquid films of water, oil (DC- 704), and UV curable polymer (UVR 6110), all without surfactant (<b>soap),</b> <b>drawn</b> in a g less than 0. 02 g, are found to be stable at least as long as the duration of a KC- 135 microgravity period (about 25 s). Films from the same fluids when drawn in normal gravity are unstable and can be made stable by adding the surfactant. Although the addition of surfactant increases the viscosity of the fluid, the film drains more rapidly due to a modified micelle fluid structure...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of polyphase ceramics contain a residual glass phase at their grain boundaries. The stability of these phases, {{particularly at the}} two-grain boundaries, is of significance since they affect {{the properties of the}} material as a whole. <b>Drawing</b> analogies with <b>soap</b> films, the stability of a continuous intergranular phase is considered in terms of the balance between the capillarity and disjoining pressures. The individual components to the disjoining pressures are discussed. It is argued that a large structural component to the disjoining pressure is responsible for the observed constancy of the thickness of its intergranular phase in polyphase silicon nitride ceramics. Mechanisms for the de-wetting of a grain boundary containing an intergranular glass phase are also discussed...|$|R
5000|$|Lyricist, {{producer}} and writer Howard Ashman had originally envisioned Ursula's relationship with King Triton as a soap opera, and thus <b>drew</b> inspiration from <b>soap</b> opera actress Joan Collins. Ursula was originally conceived as Triton's sister, {{which would have}} naturally made the character Ariel's aunt, but the idea was ultimately abandoned. However, their blood relationship is still vaguely alluded to when the character mentions a time during which she actually lived in Triton's palace. Clements and Musker had originally intended for Ursula to remain her original size {{at the end of}} the film. However, Katzenberg had just recently seen the film Die Hard (1988), which inspired him to request a [...] "bigger" [...] ending for The Little Mermaid, and thus he instructed the writers to have Ursula grow much larger in size during her climactic fight with Ariel and Eric.|$|R
5000|$|The {{lyrics of}} the album's songs {{speak of the}} pain and horror {{experienced}} during the Sierra Leone Civil War and the displacement and uncertainty {{of life as a}} refugee but the lyrics also talk about hope, peace and love. [...] Track 3 Weapon Conflict incorporates the African proverb [...] "When two elephants are fighting, the grass dem' a-suffer." [...] as its lyrics speak out against the suffering of civilians caught up in war. [...] The lyrics to Soda <b>Soap</b> <b>draw</b> directly on experience as a refugee in the camps of Guinea. Soda soap is the home made soap that people were using during wartime; the song prompts people to respect what they can make themselves. [...] The last song on the album is Ma Fo Ya a traditional song of blessing, about the song Mohamed Bangura says: [...] "I am calling out to my friends to see if they are all safe." ...|$|R
50|$|Hollyoaks is a British soap opera, first {{broadcast}} on Channel 4 on 23 October 1995. It {{was originally devised}} by Phil Redmond, who had previously conceived the Channel 4 soap Brookside. The programme {{is set in a}} fictional suburb of Chester called Hollyoaks, and features a large cast of characters primarily aged between 16 and 35. It is mostly filmed and produced in Childwall, Liverpool, although nearby locations are sometimes used. Beginning with a cast of just seven major characters in 1995, the serial now has approximately 50 main cast members. Hollyoaks has a high cast turnover in comparison with other British soaps; as of May 2014, just thirty-seven characters have spent five years or longer on the show. The programme, which is currently the UK's youngest television soap opera, has won 28 British Soap Awards, 11 Inside Soap Awards, one TRIC Award and one National Television Award; at the 2014 British Soap Awards, Hollyoaks won Best British Soap for the first time, breaking the 15-year <b>draw</b> between rival <b>soaps</b> EastEnders and Coronation Street. It is also popular around the world. The longest-serving cast member is Nick Pickard, who has played Tony Hutchinson since the first episode in 1995.|$|R
60|$|It {{was obvious}} that the king {{was not in a}} very good humour that morning. He darted little quick {{questioning}} glances at his brother and at his sons, but whatever complaint or sarcasm may have trembled upon his lips, was effectually stifled by De St. Quentin's ministrations. With the nonchalance born of long custom, the official covered the royal chin with <b>soap,</b> <b>drew</b> the razor swiftly round it, and sponged over the surface with spirits of wine. A nobleman then helped to draw on the king's black velvet haut-de-chausses, a second assisted in arranging them, while a third drew the night-gown over the shoulders, and handed the royal shirt, which had been warming before the fire. His diamond-buckled shoes, his gaiters, and his scarlet inner vest were successively fastened by noble courtiers, each keenly jealous of his own privilege, and over the vest was placed the blue ribbon with the cross of the Holy Ghost in diamonds, and that of St. Louis tied with red. To one to whom the sight was new, it might have seemed strange to see the little man, listless, passive, with his eyes fixed thoughtfully on the burning logs, while this group of men, each with a historic name, bustled round him, adding a touch here and a touch there, like a knot of children with a favourite doll. The black undercoat was drawn on, the cravat of rich lace adjusted, the loose overcoat secured, two handkerchiefs of costly point carried forward upon an enamelled saucer, and thrust by separate officials into each side pocket, the silver and ebony cane laid to hand, and the monarch was ready for the labours of the day.|$|R
