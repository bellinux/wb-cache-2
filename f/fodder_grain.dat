Fodder quality of the feed was analyzed using proximate principles. Results revealed that, the improved variety BHS 380 performed better in terms of <b>fodder,</b> <b>grain</b> and straw yields. Location wise, the performance in terms of grain and straw yield was commendable in Pithoragarh compared to Tehri Garhwal. In Tehri Garhwal BHS 380 produced substantially higher quantities of grain (4. 78 t-ha), straw (7. 31 t-ha) besides 3. 78 t-ha of green fodder during lean season, likewise in Pithorgarh district BHS 380 yielded higher quantity of grain (7. 23 t-ha) and straw(13. 80 t-ha) besides 1. 28 t-ha of green fodder during lean season, under delayed sowing in December.

Production of this species is affected by several plant diseases, such as rust. The cultivar Shilixiang {{has been identified as}} resistant to the foxtail millet rust pathogen, Uromyces setariae-italicae. In order to identify signaling pathways and genes related to the plant's defense mechanisms against rust, the Shilixiang cultivar was used to construct a digital gene expression (DGE) library during the interaction of foxtail millet with U. setariae-italicae. In this study, we determined the most abundant differentially expressed signaling pathways of up-regulated genes in foxtail millet and identified significantly up-regulated genes. Finally, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis was used to analyze the expression of nine selected genes, and the patterns observed agreed well with DGE analysis. Expression levels of the genes were also compared between a resistant cultivar Shilixiang and a susceptible cultivar Yugu- 1, and the result indicated that expression level of Shilixiang is higher than that of Yugu- 1.

The cultivation of modem varieties is limited and many farmers grow local populations of the six-row landrace ‘S'orgiu sardu’. Twelve local populations (20 strains per population) were evaluated for 13 random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers, sisisozyme loci and five morphophenological traits. Results showed that Sardinian barley is characterized by a lax six-row spike and is. in general, a spring type. Isozyme polymorphism was delected for only two esterase loci (Est and Est 4). The genetic variation for all types of murkers, was found located mostly within population (about 84 %, for isozymes aud morphaphenological traits and 89 %, for RAPDs). This finding appears to confirm the hypothesis that the populations studied belong to the same land race called ‘S'orgiu sardu’ by farmers. A geographical differential ion between southern and northern populations was foand in relation to distinct environmental characteristics. Taking into account all types of marker 209 (90. 5 %) different genotypes were identified out of 231 individuals.

40|$|The article aims to {{investigate}} how operational managerial practices {{can contribute to}} improved farm level efficiency at dairy farms. Operational managerial practices are defined as animal health, breeding, and feeding practices. The main contribution of the article is that it investigates aspects that can be adjusted every day to improve farm efficiency. Aspects describing each of the considered managerial practices are regressed on farm level data envelopment efficiency scores based on farm level data from Sweden. The results show that changes in breeding and feeding practices can lead to improved efficiency. Breeding exactly the number of heifers that is needed for replacement of the dairy cows negatively affects long-run technical efficiency. On the other hand, analyzing forage positively affects long-run allocative efficiency and analyzing <b>fodder</b> <b>grain</b> positively affects short-run economic efficiency. Feeding the cows hay instead of only silage, reduces long-run economic efficiency. No significant effects of animal health practices were found.

Results revealed that Rhizobium strains have significantly affected nodulation, growth and N content (NC) of sesbania. Based on their relative effectiveness on seedling growth of sesbania, the test strains were grouped into six clusters. Eight strains (20 %) in clusters VI, V and VI produced significantly higher nodulation, growth and NC on seedlings of sesbania than those produced by all other strains and +N treatment. On average, these strains increased shoot dry matter and NC by 50 and 50. 8 % over +N treatments, respectively. Their mean symbiotic effectiveness (SE) values were > 85 % and hence are classified as highly efficient strains.
