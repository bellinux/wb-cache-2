The first leg of the tour was a series of co-headlining shows with American thrash metal band Slayer.

500|$|The {{songs on}} The High End of Low {{appear on the}} album in {{the order in which}} they were written. The album {{contains}} material which spans across a wide variety of genres, such as industrial metal, glam rock, garage rock, blues, country, and synthpop. Its first track, [...] "Devour", is a mid-tempo rock song which begins with an acoustic guitar, with heavy drums and distorted, screamed vocals becoming more prominent as it progresses. It was written in response to the [...] "Shakespearean ideal of romance" [...] presented on <b>Eat</b> <b>Me,</b> Drink Me. Lana Cooper of PopMatters said the song [...] "runs an emotional gauntlet", and could [...] "very well be the most depressing break-up song of all time. The lonely plink of guitar strings being tuned give way to Manson's soul-wrenching eruption of [...] "And I'll love you / If you'll let me". [...] he turns on a dime, and a few lines later is vowing revenge, spitting [...] "I will blow your heart to pieces." [...] Metal Hammer later included it on their list of the 10 most underrated Marilyn Manson songs.|$|E

The album debuted at number eight {{on the chart}} with sales of over 51,000 album-equivalent units, of which 49,000 units were [...] "pure" [...] album sales—that is, traditional copies of the album, rather than units calculated {{as a measure of}} track sales or streaming.

500|$|The {{album was}} {{acclaimed}} by several publications. Spin writer Doug Brod {{referred to it}} as the band's best record since Mechanical Animals. Ed Power of Hot Press and John Earls of Planet Sound both rated the album 8 out of 10 and also compared the two releases, with the latter complimenting The High End of Lows [...] "strutting glam and magnificently [...] ballads". In another 8 out of 10 review, Amy Sciarretto of Ultimate Guitar noted Twiggy's return to the band, and claimed that he [...] "must be the catalyst sparking Manson's creative drive and gears, because [...] hasn't sounded this delightfully or determinedly pissed in quite a long time." [...] Similarly, BBC Music concluded that Twiggy's involvement saw the band resurrected after <b>Eat</b> <b>Me,</b> Drink Me, which they called [...] "lacklustre", and said that the album provided a pointed satirical commentary on modern America. Los Angeles Times reviewer Mikael Wood complimented its production, describing how the band had [...] "sculpted a sound both harder-hitting and more finely detailed than on any previous Marilyn Manson record." [...] Allison Stewart from The Washington Post praised the album for its personal lyrical content, contending that Manson's divorce from Von Teese had led to a new musical high.|$|E
500|$|The Golden Age of Grotesque is {{the final}} studio album to feature {{longtime}} keyboardist Madonna Wayne Gacy and guitarist John 5, who would both acrimoniously quit the group over the following years. John 5's relationship with Manson had soured {{over the course of}} the Grotesk Burlesk Tour. According to John, Manson spoke to him only once during the entire tour: [...] "It was on my birthday and he turned to me and said, 'Happy birthday, faggot'—then walked away." [...] Manson also displayed hostility towards the guitarist on stage. During a performance of [...] "The Beautiful People" [...] at the 2003 Rock am Ring festival, Manson kicked and then shoved John, who responded in anger by throwing his guitar to the ground and raising his fists to Manson, before resuming the song. Gacy, who was also the band's last remaining original member – excluding Manson – quit shortly before the recording of the band's next studio album, <b>Eat</b> <b>Me,</b> Drink Me (2007). He would later file a $20 million lawsuit against Marilyn Manson for unpaid [...] "partnership proceeds", accusing the vocalist of spending money earned by the band on [...] "sick and disturbing purchases of Nazi memorabilia and taxidermy, including the skeleton of a young Chinese girl." ...|$|E

500|$|On May 23, 2007, Marilyn Manson and Tim Skold {{appeared}} on UK radio station BBC Radio 1's program Live Lounge to promote Marilyn Manson's 2007 album <b>Eat</b> <b>Me,</b> Drink Me.

The Manson cover {{does not include}} the interlude. On May 28, 2007, Dutch singer Esmée Denters posted a version of the song on YouTube accompanied by Justin Timberlake on piano and backing vocals.

Until his departure in 2002, Twiggy was their chief musical contributor, co-writing many of the band's biggest hits with Manson during this period. Despite never receiving a writing credit, drummer Ginger Fish provided substantial pre-production assistance to both Manson and Twiggy while composing demos for Antichrist Superstar. His drums loops and sound effects would go on to be predominantly featured on several tracks, most notably [...] "The Beautiful People". John 5 and Tim Sköld were also prevalent composers, with the latter composing every song on <b>Eat</b> <b>Me,</b> Drink Me; while The Pale Emperor and Heaven Upside Down were composed entirely by Tyler Bates.|$|E

The film was to have an original music soundtrack with previously unreleased songs. Production of the film had been postponed indefinitely until after the <b>Eat</b> <b>Me,</b> Drink Me tour. In 2010, studio bosses shut down production on the project, reportedly due to viewers' responses to the violent content of clips released on the internet.
