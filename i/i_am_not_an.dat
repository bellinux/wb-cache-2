500|$|Dworkin's {{short fiction}} and novels often {{incorporated}} elements from {{her life and}} themes from her nonfiction writing, sometimes related by a first-person narrator. Critics have sometimes quoted passages spoken by characters in Ice and Fire as representations of Dworkin's own views. cf. Dworkin, however, wrote [...] "My fiction is not autobiography. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> exhibitionist. I do not show myself. I am not asking for forgiveness. I {{do not want to}} confess. But I have used everything I know—my life—to show what I believe must be shown {{so that it can be}} faced. The imperative at the heart of my writing—what must be done—comes directly from my life. But I do not show my life directly, in full view; nor even look at it while others watch." ...|$|E

2500|$|Like the others, the {{geographer}} is closed-minded, providing {{a caricature of}} specialization in the contemporary world. [...] The prince tells him: [...] "Your planet is very beautiful.

[...] "But <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> explorer. I haven't a single explorer on my planet. It is not the geographer who goes out to count the towns, the rivers, the mountains, the seas, the oceans, and the deserts. The geographer is much too important to go loafing about. He does not leave his desk."Similarly, when the geographer asked the prince to describe his home, the prince mentioned the rose, and the geographer explained {{that he does not}} record [...] "ephemeral" [...] things, such as roses, suggesting again the tendency of adults in general and specialists in particular to overlook the most important aspects of life. This reinforces the prince's convictions that grown-ups are a sad, dull, unimaginative lot. The geographer recommended that the prince next visit the planet Earth.|$|E
2500|$|Therefore, I beseeched the Lord {{to teach}} me His statutes. After my prayer as usual I opened my Bible with closed eyes and {{put my finger on}} the right place.

[...] I asked the Lord: [...] "O Lord! What about until then?" [...] And again I opened the Bible, that time on 1 Timothy 1:15"This is a {{faithful}} saying, and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief." [...] And for the third time I tempted the Lord, saying: [...] "O Lord! <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> Abraham nor a Jew, I'm a sinner, but involve me to understand Your Will." [...] And then I opened the Book of SirahJoshua 24:29-30, where I read in the new American Translation: [...] "Said to myself, I will water my plants, my flower bed I will drench; and suddenly this rivulet of mine became a river, then this stream of mine, a sea. Thus do I send my teaching forth shining like a dawn, to become known afar off. Thus do I pour out instruction like prophecy and bestow it on generations to come." ...|$|E
