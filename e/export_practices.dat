This dissertation examines state initiatives {{to regulate the}} flow of conventional weapons to countries engaged in massive human rights violations or violent conflict. First, I include a unique cross-national statistical analysis of the export behavior of 22 small and major conventional arms supplier states from 1981 - 2004. The analysis explores the influence of human rights, conflict, democracy, and embargoes on the <b>export</b> <b>practice</b> of top supplier states. Second, I use case studies to examine the domestic and international politics of transfer control {{in five of the}} world's top arms exporters: Belgium, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Based on extensive fieldwork, I argue that states' {{concerns for}} reputation and image in international politics are central to their acceptance of new export standards amidst changing norms of humanitarian arms control policy. Beyond new policies, however, changes in <b>export</b> <b>practice</b> are slower to emerge and closely linked to governments' reputational damage wake of arms export scandals. I find that growing arms trade transparency and an active domestic NGO community together challenge states to proceed with exports more cautiously by heightening their scandal sensitivity. I conclude that the effects of policy commitments in international fora and democratic accountability in domestic politics can begin a dynamic in which supplier states implement policies designed to enhance security and human rights outside their borders and around the world...|$|R

Our results show that all four institutional attributes positively influence export performance. This link between domestic institutional attributes and export performance becomes stronger in the case of exporters characterized by larger size, more experience, foreign market concentration, and direct exporting methods.

The empirical {{results indicate that the}} productivity effect of exporting is present at all points along the conditional output distribution, and increases as one moves from the lower tail to the upper tail of the distribution. Exporting firms that continuously exported throughout the time-period have more pronounced productivity effects compared to firms in other categories (i. e. new exporting firms, exporting firms that exit, and exporting firms that switch <b>exporting</b> <b>practices).</b> These results have implications for firm behavior and for targeting policy prescriptions to augment manufacturing competitiveness. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceNumerous {{publications}} try {{to identify}} and test empirically the link between innovation and export to explain firms’ competitiveness. But it seems that several ways of thinking coexist, without a real consensus. This article proposes a different approach, by considering innovation and export {{not in terms of}} impact of the one on the other, but rather as two complementary activities mobilizing common capabilities (resources, skills, knowledge). These common capabilities represent the capabilities that a company needs to mobilize as a priority to improve its performance regarding innovation as well as export. This article aims to identify the common spaces between innovation and export in terms of current practices within SMEs. Initially, the innovation and <b>export</b> <b>practices</b> were identified in the literature and through a set of interviews with business managers.

40|$|Background Tax {{policy is}} {{considered}} the most effective strategy to reduce tobacco consumption and prevalence. Tax avoidance and tax evasion therefore undermine the effectiveness of tax policies and result in less revenue for governments, cheaper prices for smokers and increased tobacco use. Tobacco smuggling and illicit tobacco trade have probably always existed, since tobacco's introduction as a valuable product from the New World, but {{the nature of the}} trade has changed. Methods This article clarifies definitions, reviews the key issues related to illicit trade, describes the different ways taxes are circumvented and looks at the size of the problem, its changing nature and its causes. The difficulties of data collection and research are discussed. Finally, we look at the policy options to combat illicit trade and the negotiations for a WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) protocol on illicit tobacco trade. Results Twenty years ago the main type of illicit trade was large-scale cigarette smuggling of well known cigarette brands. A change occurred as some major international tobacco companies in Europe and the Americas reviewed their <b>export</b> <b>practices</b> due to tax regulations, investigations and lawsuits by the authorities. Other types of illicit trade emerged such as illegal manufacturing, including counterfeiting and the emergence of new cigarette brands, produced in a rather open manner at well known locations, which are only or mainly intended for the illegal market of another country. Conclusions The global scope and multifaceted nature of the illicit tobacco trade requires a coordinated international response, so a strong protocol to the FCTC is essential. The illicit tobacco trade is a global problem which needs a global solution. EC FP 7 GrantEC FP 7 Grant [HEALTH-F 2 - 2009 - 223323...|$|E
40|$|The purpose o f {{the paper}} is to present the current state o f affairs in the {{agricultural}} negotiations o f the World Trade Organization, {{as well as its}} likely impact on the Common Agricultural Policy. The study is founded {{on the basis of the}} Draft modalities by C. Falconer, published on July 17 lh, 2007. As it comes to the internal support, C. Falconer suggests the reduction o f OTDS by 75 or 85 % applicable to the EU. If the parties agree on the lower value o f the reduction, this part o f the deal will not require much effort from the EU to adapt the reformed CAP to the new WTO rules. The direct payment scheme introduced by the 2003 reform, classified to the “green box”, will not be concerned by the cuts. Equally, the new de minimis threshold is completely acceptable for the UE. On the contrary, the area o f negotiations concerning market access is much more demanding from the European point o f view. The current proposal on the tariff cuts goes far beyond the last official offer made by the EU in October 2005. At the same time, the future o f the safeguard clause is uncertain and the number o f sensitive products highly unsatisfactory. Provided that the agreement is concluded in its present form, a sharp increase o f import may occur. This in consequence will heavily affect the balance o f the European agricultural markets. As a result, the cuts o f internal prices, especially for sugar and dairy products will be necessary. Similarly, the decision concerning the elimination o f the export subsidies until 2013 will make the European exports hardly profitable, while benefits generated from regulating other <b>export</b> <b>practices</b> do not seem to balance o ff the efforts. The paper ends in a conclusion that even though the European Commission is bound by the obligation to keep its offers in the limits that allow to preserve the current CAP unchanged, due to the new WTO regulations, another reform o f the European agricultural policy may not be avoided in the near future...|$|E
