40|$|The {{main task}} of this thesis was to {{investigate}} the influence of the preservation by ethyl alcohol and <b>dry</b> <b>mounting</b> on the morphometric characteristics of water bugs´ and to test the hypothesis that live individuals and individuals preserved by ethyl alcohol and dry mounted (both groups deal with individuals of the same species, sex and developmental stage) have the same morphometric parameters. The next task was to determine the effect of preparation by ethyl alcohol and <b>dry</b> <b>mounting</b> on the change of weight caused by different way of individuals´ preparation. Two model species of water bugs were chosen for this study: creeping water bug Ilyocoris cimicoides (Naucoridae) and backswimmer Notonecta glauca (Notonectidae). Weight and twelve other morphometric body characters were measured in adults of both sexes of both species. All data and their differences were tested by Student's paired t-test or nonparametric Wilcoxon test. The level of significance p = 0, 05 was used for the decision whether the difference before and after preservation by ethyl alcohol and <b>dry</b> <b>mounting</b> is or is not statistically significant. Both preservation by ethyl alcohol and <b>dry</b> <b>mounting</b> influence only the body weight of treated individuals. Other morphometric characters are more or less independent on the way of preservation of water bugs´ individuals in collections. In this work, we also tested the effect of the Dyar rule for the increase in weight and size between different developmental stages of both species studied. Dyar rule for the evolution of both species was not verified. This project was supported by the grant of the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic No. P 505 / 10 / 0096...|$|E

40|$|The {{processing}} of benthic diatoms is tedious and involves several potentially damaging steps for cells. Although {{the preservation of}} siliceous frustules {{is of paramount importance}} in the implementation of biotic indices, only few studies quantified treatment-induced cell losses. We assumed that commonly used treatments may lead to mechanical (centrifugation, sedimentation, boiling, sonication and mounting in Naphrax) and chemical (cold H 2 O 2 digestion) damages on diatoms. We analysed the potential adverse effects of these treatments and the cleaning efficiency of H 2 O 2 and incineration in order to find out the most suitable technique to process lightly silicified Mediterranean populations. Results showed that successive resuspensions of material after each concentration treatment (sedimentation and centrifugation) and low speed centrifugation did not alter the physical integrity of frustules. In contrast, boiling and sonication exhibited adverse effects especially on the preservation of large frustules and Naphrax mounting proved to be the most damaging step whatever the size of diatoms. For cleaning treatments, incineration provided the most satisfactory results and acted on a non-selective way as opposed to hydrogen peroxide which led to either a large number of non-cleaned frustules or dissolved valves. Our recommendations for processing samples of lightly silicified Mediterranean benthic diatoms include the use of low speed centrifugations, dehydration at room temperature, incineration and <b>dry</b> <b>mounting.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Clark, Harold W. (The George Washington University School of Medicine, Washington, D. C.). Sedimentation {{counting}} and morphology of Mycoplasma. J. Bacteriol. 90 : 1373 – 1386. 1965. —The sedimentation {{technique for}} counting viral particles {{was applied to}} the quantitation and morphological identification of Mycoplasma in broth cultures. Mycoplasma, apparently in their native form, firmly adhered to the surface, when sedimented on glass cover slips or onto electron microscope grids. The sedimented cover slip preparations stained with crystal violet could be readily counted in the light microscope. The cultures sedimented onto electron microscope grids were readily counted at low magnification and provided excellent preparations for morphological examination at higher magnifications. It was found that air-dried Mycoplasma particles were enlarged considerably because of excessive flattening. Fixation of sedimented Mycoplasma particles in diluted OsO 4 prior to air drying yielded a more realistic morphology, with various sizes and shapes in the stages of the growth cycle exhibited. A new technique of differentially staining Mycoplasma colonies on agar plates was developed to facilitate the quantitation of viable colony-forming units for comparison with total counts. The use of plastic or Parafilm gaskets for <b>dry</b> <b>mounting</b> was developed to facilitate the handling and examination of the stained cover slip preparations. The results of this investigation indicated that the growth cycle of some Mycoplasma species includes a stage of hexadic fission with the cleavage of minimal reproductive units (less than 100 mμ) containing a limited deoxyribonucleic acid genetic coding molecule (approximately 4 × 106) ...|$|E

40|$|Internal {{viewing of}} the {{cellular}} organization of hyphae by {{scanning electron microscopy}} is an alternative to observing sectioned fungal material with a transmission electron microscope. To study cytoplasmic organelles in the hyphal cells of fungi by SEM, colonies were chemically fixed with glutaraldehyde and osmium tetroxide and then immersed in dimethyl sulfoxide. Following this procedure, the colonies were frozen and fractured on a liquid nitrogen-precooled metal block. Next, the fractured samples were macerated in diluted osmium tetroxide to remove the cytoplasmic matrix and subsequently dehydrated by freeze substitution in methanol. After critical point <b>drying,</b> <b>mounting,</b> and sputter coating, fractured cells of several basidiomycetes were imaged with field-emission SEM. This procedure produced clear images of elongated and spherical mitochondria, the nucleus, intravacuolar structures, tubular- and plate-like endoplasmic reticulum, and different types of septal pore caps.

Laboratory measurements, including color photography in polarized light and spectroscopy of reflectance and induced fluorescence, reveal that damselflies exhibit reflectance and fluorescence properties that are closely tied to the generation of structural color. Lidar studies on C. splendens of both genders show that gender can be remotely determined, especially for specimens that were marked with Coumarin 102 and Rhodamine 6 G dyes. The results obtained in this study will be useful for future field experiments, and provide guidelines for studying damselflies in their natural habitat using lidar to survey the air above the river surface. The findings will be applicable for many other insect species and should, therefore, bring new insights into migration and movement patterns of insects in general...|$|R

50|$|Methods of storage, if done incorrectly, {{can also}} damage papyri. The {{traditional}} method in papyrus storage was {{to place the}} papyri between two sheets of glass and then seal the edges with cloth tape. This threatens the papyrus inside since it allows the object to come into {{direct contact with the}} glass, which could cause heat and moisture to come into contact with the papyrus. This could make the papyrus stick to the glass. This could also damage the ink and the surface of the papyrus when the glass is removed. A grayish material, which has been identified as a composite of sodium chloride and traces of vegetable carbohydrates, was seen around the edges of some papyri. Other storage methods which use cellulose nitrate, paper backing, drumming techniques, hinges, adhesive <b>mounts,</b> <b>dry</b> <b>mount</b> systems and plexiglass which presses directly on the papyrus are not considered safe methods of storage. The threats from these include introducing materials which could stain the artifact, degrading the object or placing pressure on the object. These effects are also not easily reversed.|$|R
