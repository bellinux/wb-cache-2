5|$|Augustinsson {{transferred}} to F.C. Copenhagen on 5 January 2015 after signing a 4.5-year contract on 6 June 2014. The deal was made so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> replacement for Pierre Bengtsson at the left-back position when Bengtsson's contract ended with Copenhagen on 31 December 2014. The transfer fee {{was estimated at}} 13 million SEK (approximately €1.4 million), which made him the most expensive wing-back ever bought from Sweden.|$|E
5|$|James {{became an}} {{unrestricted}} free agent at 12:01am EDT on July 1, 2010. During this time, he was contacted by several teams, including the Bulls, Los Angeles Clippers, Miami Heat, New York Knicks, New Jersey Nets, and Cavaliers. On July 8, he announced on a live ESPN special titled The Decision {{that he would}} sign with the Heat. The telecast was broadcast from the Boys & Girls Club of Greenwich, Connecticut and raised $2.5 million for the charity. An additional $3.5 million was raised from advertising revenue, which was donated to other charities. The day before the special, fellow free agents Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade had also announced that they would sign with Miami; reports later arose that back in 2006 the trio had discussed among themselves their upcoming 2010 free agencies. James decided to join with Bosh and Wade in part {{so that he could}} shoulder less of the offensive load; he thought that his improved teammates would give him a better chance of winning an NBA championship than had he stayed in Cleveland. Heat president Pat Riley {{played a major role in}} selling James on the idea of playing with Bosh and Wade. James would be relieved of the burden of scoring, and he thought <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> first player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple-double in a season.|$|E

25|$|However, in the 2011 World Cup, {{he is back}} to {{performing}} remarkably. In the quarter-final {{game against}} England, his partnership with Tillakaratne Dilshan, wrapped up the game, each acquiring centuries. His strong form has returned him to the opening position in the strong Sri-Lankan batting line up. He has also come in for special praise from Jayasuriya, one of the legends of cricket, saying that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> next captain of the Sri Lankan cricket team.|$|E

25|$|Searching through old videos, {{the team}} learned that Ernie {{had a son}} who'd changed his name from Lionel Dell to Mitchell Douglas. The CSIs assumed that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> killer. However, they soon learned that Ernie’s son despised his father, and that Ernie seemed to love his adopted {{children}} more. Upon learning of his fostering of children, the CSIs learned from a video tape that Ernie had at least thirteen foster kids, any one {{of which could be}} the Miniature Killer. The CSIs managed to slowly narrow down the list after tracking numerous of the Dell foster children down, some of whom had died over the years. After epithelials were discovered on a fingerprint of one of the miniature dolls made by the Miniature Killer, the CSI team learned that the killer was female, narrowing down the list of children further.|$|E
25|$|The devil, {{dressed in}} a monk's habit and with fearsome teeth, holds out some stones {{in his left hand}} and a globe in his right hand. He teases Jesus asking him to turn the stones into bread and telling Jesus, with {{reference}} to the globe, that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> ruler of the entire world if he chose to be so. Between the devil and the second image of Jesus we see Jesus wearing the crown of thorns, his hands bound and held by a soldier. He is appearing before Pontius Pilate who is seated and wears a turban. He touches his thumb with his left index finger to show that he is speaking. Then we see a second image of Jesus but without the crown of thorns. To understand this scene it is best to see the image of the devil and the image of Christ without the crown of thorns as apparitions and speaking across Pontius and that group.|$|E

When he returns from extended leave, Dylan assigns Lofty to assisting him, which surprises Lofty. When Lofty interferes with a patient's personal life, Dylan becomes frustrated but realises <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> problem and compliments Lofty on his work. When he realises Dylan has nowhere to live, Lofty invites him and his dog Dervla to live with him, which annoys Robyn and Max. They urge him to tell Dylan to move out, but Lofty struggles and Robyn inadvertently tells him so Dylan moves into a houseboat. When senior staff nurse Jacob Masters (Charles Venn) shouts at Lofty, he becomes anxious around him and avoids him. Jacob later apologies to Lofty.|$|E

Jean reveals the key is for Brian's safety deposit box in a bank. Stacey opens the box but it is empty, so when she confronts Jean, Jean reveals that Brian had another family with another woman, saying they planned to give Stacey the key when she turned 21 but after Brian's death, Sean stole it. Jean reveals that Kyle {{has been trying to}} contact her and Stacey through letters, making Stacey realise that Kyle is her half-brother. Kush tells Stacey that they must tell the truth to Shabnam and Martin about the paternity of Stacey's baby. Stacey gives birth at Lily's nativity play and Martin names the baby Arthur Fowler, after his father. When Kush holds the baby, his behaviour makes Shabnam realise that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> baby's father. Shabnam confronts Stacey but she denies Kush is the father.|$|E
500|$|Berkman {{encouraged}} Diener and Boxenbaum {{to fly out}} to Los Angeles {{to watch}} a showcase gig at The Viper Room for the four-piece Kara's Flowers. After watching Levine onstage, they were convinced. Berkman told HitQuarters he believed what the band needed was a [...] "fifth member to play the guitar and free up the singer, so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> star I perceived him to be." [...] Octone immediately insisted that the band change its name to break with its pop past. Also, the label began looking for a full-time guitarist to enable Levine to focus on performing as the frontman. James Valentine (from the L.A. band Square) was recruited for the job. On his joining the band, Valentine commented: [...] "I became friends with them and we sort of started jamming together, {{it was very much}} like I was cheating on my band, we were having sort of an affair and I eventually quit my other band to join up with them." ...|$|E
500|$|Giving {{the episode}} a 9.2 out of 10, Schedeen stated {{it was a}} [...] "blast to watch" [...] and was [...] "a more {{cohesive}} and satisfying episode than the first". Noting that the crossover [...] "wasted some of its potential by delivering two mostly standalone episodes," [...] the Arrow episode was [...] "more consistently entertaining and satisfying than the first". He enjoyed Captain Boomerang suggesting <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> [...] "most memorable villain to debut this season". Schedeen enjoyed the teams continuing to cross paths, the drama between Barry and Ollie, and [...] "the balance between light and dark [...] needed". Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode an [...] "A-", saying it [...] "..can just cut loose and have some [...] fun for an hour," [...] noting that Barry [...] "is {{one of the only}} characters able to call Oliver out on his more mopey strains of bullshit". He felt it was [...] "fitting" [...] the episode [...] "shared the name—"The Brave And The Bold"—with DC Comics' long-running team-up comic". The Flash is [...] "the brave one", who [...] "inspires with his courage" [...] though his [...] "simplistic sense of right and wrong" [...] can lead him to overlook [...] "the darker side of what they do". Oliver is [...] "the bold one", [...] "willing {{to do whatever it takes}} to see justice served".|$|E

500|$|After {{the break}} up of Kara's Flowers, Levine, along with Carmichael, left Los Angeles to pursue further studies at Five Towns College in New York. On MTV News, in 2002, he said: [...] "That's when I started {{waking up to}} the whole hip-hop, R thing. We had friends named Chaos and Shit. It was not Brentwood High". After {{dropping}} out of Five Towns College, in Dix Hills, Long Island, New York, where he and Jesse Carmichael spent a semester, they reunited with Mickey Madden and Ryan Dusick to form a band once more. They experimented with several styles, including country and folk, before deciding groove-based music would become their genre. Levine explained the need for a makeover for the band: [...] "We were just so sick of being a typical rock 'n'roll band ... I felt like I needed to look elsewhere for vocal inspiration." [...] The band put together a demo that was rejected by several labels, before falling into the hands of Octone Records executives James Diener, Ben Berkman, and David Boxenbaum. [...] Following Berkman's advice, the band added a fifth member, James Valentine, and was renamed Maroon 5. In an interview with HitQuarters, Berkman explained that Levine [...] "seemed to be a very shy, shoe-gazing type ... a fifth member could play the guitar to free up the singer , so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> star I perceived him to be".|$|E
500|$|In 1944, Miller {{was again}} {{selected}} for the RAAF team. Near-death experiences and the knowledge that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> next to die, changed Miller's outlook to life. An RAAF teammate was killed on a mission soon after hitting a century. In a match against the British Civil Defence Services at Lord's in July, Miller had reached 96 when an air raid siren signalled {{the arrival of a}} German flying bomb. It landed south of the ground and then Miller struck a four to register his ton before another flying bomb crashed close to the ground as he saluted the crowd. In a match against England, which boasted five capped and four future England Test players, Miller scored 85 in 100 minutes. While Miller was at the crease, the RAAF was on track to reach its target but his partners were dismissed around him and the RAAF fell 33 runs short after losing its last seven wickets for 51 runs. He took match figures of 6/28 against the West of England at Bristol, and top-scored in the second innings of a low-scoring match with 14. Miller was also {{selected for the}} Dominions match against England, scoring 30 in a drawn encounter. The success of the season, especially Miller and Keith Carmody's attractive batting, prompted Warner to begin planning for a [...] "Test" [...] series between the respective armed services of England and Australia.|$|E
500|$|Upon her introduction, Chloe was {{received}} positively by audiences. Soap Opera Weekly praised the character, stating, [...] "What {{started as a}} 10-episode arc as a bitchy stylist transformed into a meaty contract character and an even meatier storyline for Elizabeth Hendrickson." [...] The magazine also considered Chloe the [...] "complex Genoa City bad girl", and observed that [...] "viewers aren't exactly loving Chloe" [...] for driving a wedge between the popular pairing of Cane and Lily. Speaking of the character's pregnancy, Allison Waldman of TV Squad was unconvinced of Chloe's schemes regarding the child's paternity, writing, [...] "I'm having doubts about Chloe's bun in the oven. She claims that Cane's the father, based on one drunken night in a car that he has blacked out of his memory. Chloe's hardly a reliable source, especially since it's just been revealed that she's Kate, Esther's daughter. Yes, Esther, Kay's maid for the last 20 years or so. Cane's had DNA tests done, but they only prove <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> baby's father. Watch, this baby {{is going to have}} an interesting back story." [...] Carolyn Hinsey of the New York Daily News said Chloe's backstory reveal was a [...] "shock" [...] to fans and in light of her pregnancy wrote, [...] "Anyone who thinks Chloe's lies are over hasn't been paying attention. Is the baby even Cane's?" [...] Jillian Bowe of Zap2it credited the character as a [...] "quirky fashion diva", and penned the reunion between Chloe and Esther [...] "long overdue".|$|E

When Stacey finds out Martin is {{planning}} to propose, she says she does not want to marry again. He later proposes that she become his [...] "not-wife", so they are committed but not married, and she agrees. When Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hatchard) fails to corrently fix a faulty electric socket, Stacey is electrocuted. She and her baby are fine, and she finds out she is having a boy. She forgives Lee, and tells Shabnam that she saw her dead father Brian when she was electrocuted. When Shabnam finds the baby scan Stacey is hiding, Stacey throws her out of the flat and tears up the scan photo. When Shabnam asks why Stacey is hiding the photo from Martin, Stacey admits he is not the father but the real father was a one-night stand before getting together with him. When Kush confronts her, she tells him that she thinks <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> father. Kush's mother Carmel Kazemi (Bonnie Langford) notices Kush and Stacey talking, and realises that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> father of Stacey's baby. Kush and Stacey convince Carmel not to tell Shabnam or Martin. When Stacey later attends a church service and prays for her father, she sees Kyle, who then leaves suddenly without telling her who he is, causing her to become more suspicious.|$|E
