2500|$|The {{absorbance}} of {{the light}} is the base 10 logarithm of {{the ratio of the}} Transmittance of the pure solvent to the transmittance of the sample, and so the two absorbance and transmittance can be interconverted. Either transmittance or absorbance can therefore be plotted versus concentration using measurements from the Spectronic 20. [...] Plotting a curve using percent transmittance of light yields an <b>exponential</b> <b>curve.</b> However, absorbance is linearly related to concentration, and so absorbance is often preferred for plotting a standard curve. This type of standard curve relates the concentration of the solution (on the x-axis) to measures of its absorbance (y-axis).|$|E

People don't realise the difference between a 20,000-foot mountain and 29,000 feet. It's not just arithmetic.

2500|$|Thus as a graph it is linear pieces (as the significand grows {{for a given}} exponent) {{connecting}} the evenly spaced powers of two (when the significand is 0), with each linear piece having twice {{the slope of the}} previous: it is approximately a scaled and shifted exponential [...] Each piece takes the same horizontal space, but twice the vertical space of the last. Because the exponent is convex up, the value is always {{greater than or equal to}} the actual (shifted and scaled) <b>exponential</b> <b>curve</b> through the points with significand 0; by a slightly different shift one can more closely approximate an exponential, sometimes overestimating, sometimes underestimating. Conversely, interpreting a floating-point number as an integer gives an approximate shifted and scaled logarithm, with each piece having half the slope of the last, taking the same vertical space but twice the horizontal space. Since the logarithm is convex down, the approximation is always less than the corresponding logarithmic curve; again, a different choice of scale and shift (as at above right) yields a closer approximation.|$|E

50|$|The {{distribution}} of failure times is over-laid with a curve representing an exponential distribution. For this example, the exponential distribution approximates the {{distribution of}} failure times. The <b>exponential</b> <b>curve</b> is a theoretical distribution fitted to the actual failure times. This particular <b>exponential</b> <b>curve</b> is specified by the parameter lambda, λ= 1/(mean time to failure) = 1/59.6 = 0.0168. The distribution of failure times is called the probability density function (pdf), if time can take any positive value. In equations, the pdf is specified as f(t). If time can only take discrete values (such as 1 day, 2 days, and so on), {{the distribution of}} failure times is called the probability mass function (pmf). Most survival analysis methods assume that time can take any positive value, and f(t) is the pdf. If the time between observed air conditioner failures is approximated using the exponential function, then the <b>exponential</b> <b>curve</b> gives the probability density function, f(t), for air conditioner failure times.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} robust and fully {{automatic}} method {{for the analysis}} of vessel tortuosity. Our method does not rely on pre-segmentation of vessels, but instead acts directly on retinal image data. The method is based on theory of best-fit <b>exponential</b> <b>curves</b> in the roto-translation group SE(2). We lift 2 D images to 3 D functions called orientation scores by including an orientation dimension in the domain. In the extended domain of positions and orientations (identified with SE(2)) we study <b>exponential</b> <b>curves,</b> whose spatial projections have constant curvature. By locally fitting such curves to data in orientation scores, via our new iterative stabilizing refinement method, we are able to assign to each location a curvature and confidence value. These values are then used to define global tortuosity measures. The method is validated on synthetic and retinal images. We show that the tortuosity measures can serve as effective biomarkers for diabetes and different stages of diabetic retinopathy...|$|R
