The roller type compactors are used for {{compacting}} crushed rock as the base layer underneath concrete or stone foundations or slabs. The plate compactor (vibratory rammer) has a large vibrating baseplate and is suited for creating a level grade, while the jumping jack compactor has a smaller foot.

50|$|The {{original}} ram BOPs of the 1920s {{were simple}} and rugged manual devices with minimal parts. The BOP housing (body) had a vertical well bore and horizontal ram cavity (ram guide chamber). Opposing rams (plungers) in the ram cavity translated horizontally, actuated by threaded ram shafts (piston rods) {{in the manner}} of a screw jack. Torque from turning the ram shafts by wrench or hand wheel was converted to linear motion and the rams, coupled to the inner ends of the ram shafts, opened and closed the well bore. Such screw <b>jack</b> <b>type</b> operation provided enough mechanical advantage for rams to overcome downhole pressures and seal the wellbore annulus.|$|E
50|$|Historically {{telephones}} {{were typically}} {{owned by the}} telephone company and were usually permanently wired to the telephone line. However, for many installations it was necessary or convenient to provide portable telephone sets that could be moved to a different location within the customer's premises. For this purpose telephone companies developed jacks and plugs with a varying number of contacts. Before ca. 1930, concentric connectors with three contacts were sufficient, but the upgrade of telephone sets to anti-sidetone circuitry required four conductors between the desk set and the subscriber set. For this purpose, Bell System engineers developed a cube-shaped four-prong plug (type No. 238) with uneven prong spacings to avoid improper insertion into the <b>jack</b> (<b>type</b> No. 404). This jack and plug combination later became the standard line connection for portable telephone sets.|$|E

40|$|Species {{richness}} is {{the most}} widely used measure of biodiversity. It is considered crucial for testing numerous ecological theories. While local species richness is easily determined by sampling, the quantification of regional richness relies on more or less complete species inventories, expert estimation, or mathematical extrapolation from a number of replicated local samplings. However the accuracy of such extrapolations is rarely known. In this study, we compare the common estimators MM (Michaelis-Menten), Chao 1, Chao 2, ACE (Abundance-based Coverage Estimator), and the first and second order Jackknifes against the asymptote of the species accumulation curve, which we use as an estimate of true regional richness. Subsequently, we quantified the role of sample size, i. e., number of replicates, for precision, accuracy, and bias of the estimation. These replicates were sub-sets of three large data sets of benthic assemblages from the NE Atlantic: (i) soft-bottom sediment communities in the Western Baltic (n = 70); (ii) hard-bottom communities from emergent rock on the Island of Helgoland, North Sea (n = 52), and (iii) hardbottom assemblages grown on artificial substrata in Madeira Island, Portugal (n = 56). For all community <b>types,</b> <b>Jack</b> 2 showed a better performance in terms of bias and accuracy while MM exhibited the highest precision. However, in virtually all cases and across all sampling efforts, the estimators underestimated the regional species richness, regardless of habitat type, or selected estimator. Generally, the amount of underestimation decreased with sampling effort. A logarithmic function was applied to quantify the bias caused by low replication using the best estimator, Jack 2. The bias was more obvious in the soft-bottom environment, followed by the natural hard-bottom and the artificial hard-bottom habitats, respectively. If a weaker estimator in terms of performance is chosen for this quantification, more replicates are required to obtain a reliable estimation of regional richness...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of multi-agent software systems {{is considered a}} complex task due to (a) the large number and heterogeneity of documents generated during the {{development of}} these systems, (b) the lack of support for the whole development life-cycle by existing agent-oriented methodologies requiring the use of different methodologies, and (c) the possible incompleteness of the documents and models generated during the development of the systems. In order to alleviate the above problems, in this thesis, a traceability framework is described to support the development of multi-agent systems. The framework supports automatic generation of traceability relations and identification of missing elements (i. e., completeness checking) in the models created during the development life-cycle of multi-agent systems using the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) architecture. Traceability has been recognized as an important activity in the software development process. Traceability relations can guarantee and improve software quality and can help with several tasks such as the evolution of software systems, reuse of parts of the system, validation that a system meets its requirements, understanding of the rationale for certain design decisions, identification of common aspects of the system, and analysis of implications of changes in the system. The traceability framework presented in this thesis concentrates on multi-agent software systems developed using i* framework, Prometheus methodology, and JACK language. Here, a traceability reference model is presented for software artefacts generated when using i* framework, Prometheus methodology, and <b>JACK</b> language. Different <b>types</b> of relations between the artefacts are identified. The framework is based on a rule-based approach to support automatic identification of traceability relations and missing elements between the generated artefacts. Software models represented in XML were used to support the heterogeneity of models and tools used during the software development life-cycle. In the framework, the rules are specified in an extension of XQuery to support (i) representation of the consequence part of the rules, i. e. the actions to be taken when the conditions are satisfied, and (ii) extra functions to cover some of the traceability relations being proposed and completeness checking of the models. A prototype tool has been developed to illustrate and evaluate the work. The work has been evaluated in terms of recall and precision measurements in three different case studies.

40|$|Diepkloof Rock Shelter {{offers an}} {{exceptional}} {{opportunity to study}} the onset and evolution of both Still Bay (SB) and Howiesons Poort (HP) techno-complexes. However, previous age estimates based on luminescence dating of burnt quartzites (Tribolo et al., 2009) and of sediments (Jacobs et al., 2008) were not in agreement. Here, we present new luminescence ages for 17 rock samples (equivalent dose estimated with a SAR-ITL protocol instead of classical MAAD-TL) {{as well as for}} 5 sediment samples (equivalent dose estimated with SAR-single grain OSL protocol) and an update of the 22 previous age estimates for burnt lithics (modified calibration and beta dose estimates). While a good agreement between the rock and sediment ages is obtained, these estimates are still significantly older than those reported by Jacobs et al. (2008). After our own analyses of the sediment from Diepkloof, it is suspected that these authors did not correctly chose the parameters for the equivalent dose determination, leading to an underestimate of the equivalent doses, and thus of the ages. From bottom to top, the mean ages are 100 ± 10 ka for stratigraphic unit (SU) Noël and 107 ± 11 ka for SU Mark (uncharacterized Lower MSA), 100 ± 10 ka for SU Lynn-Leo (Pre-SB type Lynn), 109 ± 10 ka for SUs Kim-Larry (SB), 105 ± 10 ka for SUs Kerry-Kate and 109 ± 10 ka for SU Jess (Early HP), 89 ± 8 ka for SU Jude (MSA <b>type</b> <b>Jack),</b> 77 ± 8 ka for SU John, 85 ± 9 ka for SU Fox, 83 ± 8 ka for SU Fred and 65 ± 8 ka for SU OB 5 (Intermediate HP), 52 ± 5 ka for SUs OB 2 - 4 (Late HP). This chronology, together with the technological analyses, greatly modifies the current chrono-cultural model regarding the SB and the HP and has important archaeological implications. Indeed, SB and HP no longer appear as short-lived techno-complexes with synchronous appearances for each and restricted to Oxygen Isotopic Stage (OIS) 4 across South Africa, as suggested by Jacobs et al. (2008, 2012). Rather, the sequence of Diepkloof supports a long chronology model with an early appearance of both SB and HP {{in the first half of}} OIS 5 and a long duration of the HP into OIS 3. These new dates imply that different technological traditions coexisted during OIS 5 and 4 in southern Africa and that SB and HP can no longer be considered as horizon markers...|$|R
40|$|Significant {{developments}} in piling technology {{over the last}} few decades have yielded a variety of new pile <b>types.</b> <b>Jacked</b> and Drilled-Displacement (DD) piles, for example, are two emerging pile types that are becoming increasingly popular in geotechnical engineering practice. Jacking of steel or precast concrete piles into the ground is an effective and environmentally friendly pile installation technique (produces minimal noise, vibration and air pollution). DD piles, which are installed using a drilling tool consisting of a partial-flight auger and a displacement body, are a new generation of rotary displacement piles. Different types of DD piles are available in practice; each type is classified according to the design of the drilling tool and associated installation method. ^ Installation of a pile often involves complex loading modes that cause substantial changes {{in the state of the}} soil surrounding the pile. As a result of these changes, the response of piles to structural loads varies greatly depending on the installation method used. For reliable estimation of pile capacity, design methods should account for the effect of the installation technique. Empirical or semi-empirical equations, based on results of load tests performed on driven piles (i. e., piles installed using hammers or vibrators), are often used to calculate the capacity of jacked piles. However, the mechanics involved in pile driving (a dynamic process) differ from those prevalent in pile jacking (a quasi-static process). Similarly, the currently available design methods for DD piles rely exclusively on empirical relations developed based on the results of load tests performed on particular types of DD piles installed at specific sites. ^ No theoretical research has been performed to assess the effect of the installation method on the shaft resistance of jacked and DD piles. In order to develop design equations for the calculation of the shaft resistance of these piles, we performed FE analyses using advanced constitutive models for sand and clay. The plasticity-based constitutive models capture key features of soil behavior during pile installation and loading. The proposed design equations involve installation parameters (e. g., number of jacking strokes for jacked piles, and rate of drilling for DD piles), in situ soil state and properties (e. g., relative density and confinement for sand and undrained shear strength for clay), and some other key soil characteristics (e. g., initial fabric anisotropy for sand, and residual shear strength for clay). Additionally, setup factors are proposed that can be used to estimate the gain in shaft resistance as a function of time after installation of jacked piles in clay. Good agreement was obtained between the shaft resistance values calculated with the proposed equations and the data available in the literature. ...|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} was planned {{to determine the}} natural resistance of three wood species (Acacia nilotica Wild, Dalbergia sissoo Roxb and Pinus wallichiana A. B. <b>Jacks)</b> and their <b>types</b> (sapwood and heartwood) against the termite workers (Odontotermes obesus Ramb.). Laboratory and field experiments were carried out to classify the woods according to their resistance/susceptibility against the termite. Among three wood species, D. sissoo heartwood exhibited high resistance against termites' attack. Seasoning of woods was done by oven drying at three temperatures (60, 80 and 100 ºC) for 10 and 15 days. The oven dried (100 ºC for 15 days) woods showed weight loss reduction up to 20 - 25 % while the termites mortality increased from 25 - 30 % as compared to fresh woods exposed to termites infestation. In both natural resistance and seasoning experiments the order of wood resistance to the termite workers was P. wallichiana< A. nilotica <D. sissoo. The best seasoned woods were then treated with five different oils viz; Jatropha curcas Linn (Jatropha), Lignum usitatissimum L. (Linseed), Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh. (Eucalyptus), Azadirachta indica A. Juss. (Neem) and Simmondsia chinensis C. K. Schneid (Jojoba) at three concentrations (5, 10 and 15 %). Three oil application methods; surface treatment (coating/brushing), dipping and vacuum pressure treatment were used to treat the woods. Wood treated with vacuum pressure oil application exhibited 20 - 25 % weight loss reduction after the termite exposure both in laboratory and field (no choice and choice) bioassays as compared to other two oil application methods. Among all the oils, linseed and neem oil showed minimum weight loss and 100 % mortality at higher concentration (15 %) followed by eualyptus, jatropha and jojoba oil. The highest oil retention was recorded in P. wallichiana wood treated with linseed and neem oil at 15 % concentration. Leaching percentage of different oils from treated woods was determined by weathering test and the oil leaching ranged from 2. 42 - 10. 73 % in all wood species. The penetration of different oils in three wood species was determined by adding aniline blue dye while making oil concentration (15 %). The treated wood was cut into slices length wide and the dye indicated the oil existence in different layers of the wood. The highest penetration was recorded in P. wallichiana wood while A. nilotica showed the lowest oil penetration. The oil was extracted from treated wood slices by Soxhlet extraction and the oil analysis was done by Gas Chromatography (GC) thus, the chromatographs confirmed the oil presence in the respective wood samples. The oil application improved the physical (specific gravity, anti-shrinkage efficacy) and mechanical properties (MOE and MOR) of the woods. Among all the oils, eucalyptus oil showed highest ASE (%) in D. sissoo wood while, the highest specific gravity was recorded in eucalyptus and neem oil treated A. nilotica wood as compared to untreated wood. Jojoba oil treated D. sissoo heartwood and linseed oil treated P. wallichiana sapwood exhibited high specific gravity as compared to untreated wood. MOE and MOR was determined by three points bending test and in P. wallichiana and D. sissoo the highest MOE was recorded in linseed and eucalyptus oil treatment. The MOR value increased in linseed oil treated P. wallichiana while in jojoba, eucalyptus and neem oil treated D. sissoo and A. nilotica wood, MOR values increased as compared to control treatment. Seasoning along with oil treatment gave good protection against termites' infestation in naturally resistant (D. sissoo) {{as well as in}} susceptible (P. wallichiana) woods. All the experimental oils can be used as wood preservatives without impairing the physical and mechanical properties of woods...|$|R
