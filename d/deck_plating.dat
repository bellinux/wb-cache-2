The navy {{originally}} intended to reduce her to Category B reserve, but decided to assign Wrangler to the Naval Training Command on 18 January 1946 and she became the chemical warfare training ship based at Devonport Royal Dockyard. From September 1946 until 1950 the ship was with the Rosyth Local Flotilla as a boys' training ship and had her 40mm guns removed during her December 1946 – January 1947 refit. Two years later Wrangler was in a collision that damaged her Carley floats and main <b>deck</b> <b>plating.</b> In 1950–51 she {{was assigned to the}} 4th Training Flotilla. The ship was allocated to the Type 15 programme on 4 January 1950 and sailed to Devonport in February 1951 to prepare for the reconstruction. From June 1951 to 10 March 1953 she was rebuilt by Harland & Wolff at Belfast, Northern Ireland, with the new pennant number F157. On re-commissioning in 1953 she took part in the Fleet Review to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. Between 1953 and 1955 she served as part of the 5th Frigate Squadron in the Mediterranean. In 1954 Wrangler was involved in the search for wreckage of the BOAC de Havilland Comet airliner G-ALYP, that crashed in the Mediterranean Sea near the island of Elba. On 4 February 1955, she ran aground at Villefranche sur Mer, France; she was refloated on 6 February 1955 by French Navy and Italian Navy tugs.|$|E

2500|$|In June 1941 His Majesty's Government, {{seeking to}} take {{advantage}} of the US Lend-Lease program, asked the United States to design, build and supply an escort vessel that was suitable for anti-submarine warfare in deep open ocean situations. The requested particulars were a length of , a speed of , a dual purpose main armament and an open bridge. The United States Navy had been looking into the feasibility of such a vessel since 1939, and Captain E. L. Cochrane of the US Navy's [...] Bureau of Ships– who, during his visit to the United Kingdom in 1940, had looked at Royal Navy corvettes and s– had come up with a design for such a vessel. This design anticipated a need for large numbers of this type of vessels, and had sought to remove the major production bottleneck for such vessels: reduction gearing required for the steam turbine machinery of destroyers. The production of reduction gears could not be easily increased, as the precision machinery required for their construction alone took over a year to produce. Therefore, a readily-available and proven layout of diesel-electric machinery, also used on submarines, was adopted. When the United Kingdom made its request, Admiral Stark of the US Navy decided to put these plans into motion and recommended that the British order be approved. Gibbs and Cox, the marine architects charged with creating working plans, had to make several alterations to the production methods and to Captain Cochrane's original design, most notably dropping another production bottleneck– the five inch/38 caliber gun– and replacing it with the three inch/50 caliber gun, which allowed adding a superfiring third gun (at the [...] "B" [...] position, forward); also, the original design specified eight engines for [...] but other priority programs forced the use of only four with a consequent shortening of the hull and reduction of the ship's maximum speed by an estimated [...] [...] The design had relatively light armour with for example the steel plate used on the Buckleys ranging from 1/2 inch to 7/16 inch with 1/4 inch plate being used for the majority of the hull and <b>deck</b> <b>plating.</b>|$|E

40|$|Orthotropic decks are {{composed}} of <b>deck</b> <b>plate,</b> ribs, and cross-beams and are frequently used in industry to span long distances, due to their light structures and load carrying capacities. Trapezoidal ribs are broadly preferred as longitudinal stiffeners in design of orthotropic decks. They supply the required stiffness to the orthotropic deck in traffic direction. Trapezoidal ribs are chosen in industrial applications because of their high torsional and buckling rigidity, less material and welding needs. Rib width, height, spacing, thickness of <b>deck</b> <b>plate</b> are important parameters for designing of orthotropic decks. In {{the scope of this}} study, rib width to height and rib spacing to <b>deck</b> <b>plate</b> thickness ratios are assessed by means of the stresses developed under different ratios of these parameters.

40|$|Due to an {{unexpected}} increase of heavy traffic large fatigue cracks appeared through the <b>deck</b> <b>plate</b> of orthotropic steel bridge decks in the Netherlands. Visual inspection revealed {{that this particular}} type of crack initiates where a weld joins the <b>deck</b> <b>plate,</b> a rib and a girder. These critical points are commonly inspected from the roadside, which necessitates that the road is closed down for all traffic and that the wear layer is first removed. To overcome these costly drawbacks a new method is proposed that enables ultrasonic inspection of the <b>deck</b> <b>plate</b> from {{the underside of the}} bridge deck. The method requires a combination of two special measurement techniques, which are optimised for the bridge problem at hand. To detect the maximum crack depth an angled pitch-catch technique is employed. The crack length can be detected along the rib weld by employing the simpler pulse-echo technique. The crack depth and crack length are determined from the respective ultrasonic data sets by a calibration, which relates the number of detected waves to the actual crack size. The calibration is determined by ultrasonically monitoring the various crack stages during a fatigue test that is conducted on a bridge deck specimen. The original, uncracked state and the final state where the cracks can be visibly detected in the <b>deck</b> <b>plate</b> determine the extremes. The tests show that a reasonable accurate detection of crack size is quite possible, while the visual inspections prove to be useless until the crack has already grown completely through the <b>deck</b> <b>plate.</b> The new method provides a crack depth and crack length estimate with an accuracy of ± 15 %.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a semi-probabilistic approach {{to assess the}} time-varying ultimate strength of aging tanker's <b>deck</b> <b>plate</b> considering corrosion wastage. The procedure includes (1) defining the limit state function of <b>deck</b> <b>plate</b> failure, (2) determining the time-varying probability density function of corrosion wastage and values for selected severity levels of corrosion, (3) calculating the time-varying ultimate strength of <b>deck</b> <b>plates</b> corresponding to the selected levels of corrosion wastage, (4) determining the time-varying maximum nominal stress, (5) calculating when the <b>deck</b> <b>plate</b> reaches the ultimate strength limit state, and (6) determining the inspection intervals based on the risk of ultimate strength failure. A nonlinear corrosion model was proposed for deriving the time-varying probability density function of deck plates' corrosion wastage. The probability density function was determined based on a statistical analysis of the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) corrosion wastage database [Wang G, Spencer J, Sun HH. Assessment of Corrosion Risks to Aging Oil Tankers In: 22 nd International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering, Cancun, Mexico, 8 – 13 June 2002]. To simplify the calculations of ultimate strength, a semi-probabilistic model was adopted. Three levels of corrosion severity were considered, and the corresponding values of corrosion wastage were used instead of the probability density function. The increasing nominal stresses as ships age were also taken into account considering the loss of global hull girder section modulus. The loads of still-water-induced and wave-induced bending moments were treated as deterministic values. The ultimate strength calculation {{was based on the}} latest International Association of Classification Societies (IACS) – Common Structure Rule (CSR) formula [Common Structural Rules for Double Hull Oil Tankers, [URL] 2007]. Deck failure was defined as <b>deck</b> <b>plate's</b> ultimate strength becoming lower than the maximum nominal stress. An inspection should be conducted before such failure takes place.
