It {{is essential to}} use efficient algorithms for redistribution; otherwise {{the performance of the}} programs will degrade considerably. The redistribution overheads consist of two parts: <b>index</b> <b>computation</b> and inter-processor communication. In this paper, by using a notation for the local data description called an LDD, we propose a framework to optimize the array redistribution algorithm both in <b>index</b> <b>computation</b> and inter-processor communication. That is, our work makes an effort to optimize not only the computation cost but also communication cost for array redistribution algorithms. We present an efficient <b>index</b> <b>computation</b> method and generate a schedule that minimizes the number of communication steps and eliminates node contention in each communication step. Some experiments show the efficiency and flexibility of our techniques...|$|E
40|$|The {{stock market}} index is a {{valuable}} financial tool to measure the state of {{a segment of the}} stock market. With high input data rates, real-time <b>index</b> <b>computation</b> is a challenging task. It cannot be done in real-time with today's reasonably high-end computers with many CPU cores. Doing so with CPU-based systems will require server farms with lots of computing power and therefore costly. Thus currently this index value is computed periodically (non-real-time). In this paper we describe our attempt in fast <b>index</b> <b>computation</b> using Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), which usually have several hundreds of processing cores and are much less expensive than CPU-based solutions. The computation itself is data parallel and therefore suitable for GPU processing. Preliminary results indicate our approach is promising as we can compute much faster using GPUs than using multi-core CPUs...|$|E

40|$|As {{reconfigurable}} devices move to {{the forefront}} of mainstream processing, the spectrum of application areas for such devices is also increasing. One such area is image processing. In this paper we present a novel hardware-software codesign architecture for the computation of the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), based on a new Recursive Merge Filtering (RMF) algorithm. The architecture aims at reducing the overall data routing during the computation of the DWT. The method shows how data routing can be transformed into a series of <b>index</b> <b>computations</b> carried out on the reconfigurable device. The architecture applies hardware/software codesign principles for task division among the available processing resources and uses memory resources closer to the FPGA to avoid the main memory accesses and this reduces the processing time and access time.

The architecture is based on a dynamically reconfigurable device, the Xilinx XC 6200 on the H. O.

In this paper, we investigate the energy implications of trad-ing computation for locality by applying Hilbert and Morton space-filling curves to dense matrix-matrix multiplication. The advantage of these curves is that they exhibit an inherent tiling effect without requiring specific architecture tuning. By accessing the matrices in the order determined by the space-filling curves, we can trade computation for locality. The <b>index</b> <b>computation</b> overhead of the Morton curve is found to be balanced against its locality and energy efficiency, while the overhead of the Hilbert curve outweighs its improvements on our test system.
