25|$|Unpolarized {{light can}} be {{described}} as a mixture of two independent oppositely polarized streams, each with half the intensity. Light is said to be partially polarized when there is more power in one of these streams than the other. At any particular wavelength, partially polarized light can be statistically described as the superposition of a completely unpolarized component and a completely polarized one. One may then describe the light in terms of the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>polarization</b> and the parameters of the polarized component. That polarized component {{can be described}} in terms of a Jones vector or polarization ellipse, as is detailed above. However, in order to also describe the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>polarization,</b> one normally employs Stokes parameters (see below) to specify a state of partial polarization.|$|E
25|$|Unpolarized light, after {{reflection}} at a specular (shiny) surface, generally obtains a <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>polarization.</b> This phenomenon {{was observed}} in 1808 by the mathematician Étienne-Louis Malus after whom Malus's law is named. Polarizing sunglasses exploit this effect to reduce glare from reflections by horizontal surfaces, notably the road ahead viewed at a grazing angle.|$|E
25|$|The {{coherency}} matrix is {{not easy}} to visualize, and it is therefore common to describe incoherent or partially polarized radiation in terms of its total intensity (I), (fractional) <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>polarization</b> (p), and the shape parameters of the polarization ellipse. An alternative and mathematically convenient description is given by the Stokes parameters, introduced by George Gabriel Stokes in 1852. The relationship of the Stokes parameters to intensity and polarization ellipse parameters is shown in the equations and figure below.|$|E
40|$|Some of the {{features}} of synchrotron radiation are examined which occur when relativistic particles move at small pitch angles in a magnetic field. The emission from individual particles is computed. The general properties of the emission from distributions of particles with small pitch angles is discussed, and the emissivities and <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>polarization</b> for several specific source models are presented. For sources which mainly contain particles with small pitch angles, the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> circular <b>polarization</b> will normally be high, whereas, if the magnetic field is somewhat irregular, the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> linear <b>polarization</b> will be small. If the particle distribution also has a low-energy cutoff, the emissivity will vary linearly with frequency at low frequencies...|$|R
40|$|The crossed-planar {{undulator}} is {{a promising}} scheme for full polarization control in x-ray FELs. For SASE FELs, {{it has been}} shown a maximum <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> circular <b>polarization</b> <b>of</b> about 80 % is achievable at fundamental wavelength just before saturation. In this paper, we study the effectiveness of a crossed undulator for a seeded x-ray FEL. The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> circular <b>polarization</b> for both the fundamental and the harmonic radiation are considered.

40|$|The {{nuclear physics}} {{experiments}} at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility often require longitudinally polarized electrons to be simultaneously delivered to three experimental halls. The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> longitudinal <b>polarization</b> to each hall varies as {{function of the}} accelerator settings, making it challenging in certain situations to deliver a high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> longitudinal <b>polarization</b> to all the halls simultaneously. Normally, the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> longitudinal <b>polarization</b> the halls receive is optimized by changing the initial spin direction {{at the beginning of}} the machine with a Wien filter. Herein, it is shown that it is possible to further improve the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> longitudinal <b>polarization</b> for multiple experimental halls by redistributing the energy gain of the CEBAF linacs while keeping the total energy gain fixed.

25|$|A {{more useful}} {{polarized}} beam {{can be obtained}} by tilting the pile of plates at a steeper angle to the incident beam. Counterintuitively, using incident angles greater than Brewster's angle yields a higher <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>polarization</b> of the transmitted beam, at the expense of decreased overall transmission. For angles of incidence steeper than 80° the polarization of the transmitted beam can approach 100% with as few as four plates, although the transmitted intensity is very low in this case. Adding more plates and reducing the angle allows a better compromise between transmission and polarization to be achieved.|$|E
25|$|Starlight becomes {{partially}} {{linearly polarized}} by scattering from elongated interstellar dust grains whose long axes {{tend to be}} oriented perpendicular to the galactic magnetic field. According to the Davis–Greenstein mechanism, the grains spin rapidly with their rotation axis along the magnetic field. Light polarized along {{the direction of the}} magnetic field perpendicular to the line of sight is transmitted, while light polarized in the plane defined by the rotating grain is blocked. Thus the polarization direction can be used to map out the galactic magnetic field. The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>polarization</b> is on the order of 1.5% for stars at 1000 parsecs distance.|$|E
25|$|Most {{sources of}} {{electromagnetic}} radiation contain {{a large number}} of atoms or molecules that emit light. The orientation of the electric fields produced by these emitters may not be correlated, in which case the light is said to be unpolarised. If there is partial correlation between the emitters, the light is partially polarised. If the polarization is consistent across the spectrum of the source, partially polarised light can be described as a superposition of a completely unpolarised component, and a completely polarised one. One may then describe the light in terms of the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>polarization,</b> and the parameters of the polarization ellipse.|$|E

25|$|One can {{visualize}} {{the case of}} linear birefringence (with two orthogonal linear propagation modes) with an incoming wave linearly polarized at a 45° angle to those modes. As a differential phase starts to accrue, the polarization becomes elliptical, eventually changing to purely circular polarization (90° phase difference), then to elliptical and eventually linear polarization (180° phase) perpendicular to the original polarization, then through circular again (270° phase), then elliptical with the original azimuth angle, and finally {{back to the original}} linearly polarized state (360° phase) where the cycle begins anew. In general the situation is more complicated and can be characterized as a rotation in the Poincaré sphere about the axis defined by the propagation modes. Examples for linear (blue), circular (red), and elliptical (yellow) birefringence are shown in the figure on the left. The total intensity and <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>polarization</b> are unaffected. If the path length in the birefringent medium is sufficient, the two polarization components of a collimated beam (or ray) can exit the material with a positional offset, even though their final propagation directions will be the same (assuming the entrance face and exit face are parallel). This is commonly viewed using calcite crystals, which present the viewer with two slightly offset images, in opposite polarizations, of an object behind the crystal. It was this effect that provided the first discovery of polarization, by Erasmus Bartholinus in 1669.|$|E

However, in many {{instances}} the more relevant figure of merit is the polarizer's <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>polarization</b> or extinction ratio, which involve a comparison of g1 to g2. Since Jones vectors refer to waves' amplitudes (rather than intensity), when illuminated by unpolarized light the remaining power in the unwanted polarization will be (g2/g1)2 of the power in the intended polarization.|$|E
2500|$|For {{practical}} purposes, {{the separation}} between wires must be less than the wavelength of the incident radiation. [...] In addition, the width of each wires should be small compared to the spacing between wires. Therefore, it {{is relatively easy to}} construct wire-grid polarizers for microwaves, far-infrared, and mid-infrared radiation. [...] In addition, advanced lithographic techniques can also build very tight pitch metallic grids, allowing for the polarization of visible light to a useful degree. Since the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>polarization</b> depends little on wavelength and angle of incidence, they are used for broad-band applications such as projection.|$|E

As {{the sun sets}} due West, the maximum <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>polarization</b> {{can be seen in}} the North-Zenith-South plane. Along the horizon, at an altitude of 0° it is highest in the North and South, and lowest in the East and West. Then as altitude increases approaching the zenith (or the plane of maximum polarization) the polarization remains high in the North and South and increases until it is again maximum at 90° in the East and West, where it is then at the zenith and within the plane of polarization.Click on the adjacent image to view an animation that represents the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>polarization</b> as shown on the celestial sphere. Black represents areas where the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>polarization</b> is zero, whereas red represents areas where the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>polarization</b> is much larger. It is approximately 80%, which is a realistic maximum for the clear Rayleigh sky during day time. The video thus begins when the sun is slightly above the horizon and at an azimuth of 120°. The sky is highly polarized in the effective North-Zenith-South plane. This is slightly offset because the sun's azimuth is not due East. The sun moves across the sky with clear circular polarization patterns surrounding it. When the sun is located at the zenith the polarization is independent of azimuth and decreases with rising altitude (as it approaches the sun). The pattern then continues as the sun approaches the horizon once again for sunset. The video ends with the sun below the horizon.|$|E
