Goldstein served with the National Guard, wearing the beard as a result of the waiver he received until he reached mandatory retirement age, when the U.S. Army Reserve approved his application to serve as a reserve chaplain, agreeing to retain the waiver.|$|E

2500|$|Many slogans and terms coined {{came to be}} used by Bush's {{political}} opponents, {{or those}} opposed to the war. For example, in April 2003 John Kerry, the Democratic candidate in the presidential election, said at a campaign rally: [...] "What we need now is not just a regime change <b>in</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein and Iraq, but we need a regime change in the United States." [...] Other war critics use the name [...] "Operation Iraqi Liberation (OIL)" [...] to subtly convey their belief with respect to the cause of the war, such as the song [...] "Operation Iraqi Liberation (OIL)" [...] by David Rovics, a popular folk protest singer.|$|E

Hitchens writes, [...] "in this peaceable kingdom, according to Moore's flabbergasting choice of film shots, children are flying little kites, shoppers are smiling in the sunshine, and the gentle rhythms of life are undisturbed. Then—wham! From the night sky come the terror weapons of American imperialism. Watching the clips Moore uses, and recalling them well, I can recognize various Saddam palaces and military and police centers getting the treatment. But these sites are not identified as such. In fact, I don't think Al Jazeera would, on a bad day, have transmitted anything so utterly propagandistic." [...] While interviewing Hitchens on his show, Scarborough claimed to be outraged at Moore's portrayal of the Iraqi insurgency, claiming Moore's film suggests [...] "those killing Americans in Iraq aren't the enemy, but rather they are the revolution and the Minutemen, who are sure to win their battle against the occupation" [...] and that [...] "Moore says that the enemy is George Bush and Saddam Hussein and Mr. Zarqawi and Mr. Bin Laden are no problem. ... Indeed, they are the Minutemen. They're the staunch American revolutionaries." ...|$|E
