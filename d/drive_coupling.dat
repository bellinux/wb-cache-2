40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the problem of {{dynamics}} of externally driven open quantum systems. Using the path integral methods we found an analytical expression for time-dependent density matrix of two externally <b>driven</b> <b>coupled</b> quantum oscillators interacting with different baths of oscillators. It is shown that at the zeroing of external forces the density matrix becomes identical to the previously obtained one for freely developing coupled oscillators. Mean values of observables are computed by using the Hermitian part of the matrix. All elements of the covariance matrix composed by coordinates and momenta of two <b>driven</b> <b>coupled</b> oscillators are calculated. The time-dependent mean values, dispersions and covariances of coordinates of coupled oscillators at given external forces are numerically studied. It is shown that the larger the coupling constant the larger is the disturbances of the second oscillator due to external action on the first oscillator. Coupled dynamics of forced oscillators at relatively large coupling constant is demonstrated at different thermodynamic conditions. Comment: 4 figure...|$|R

50|$|Operators of 18-wheelers, farm equipment, {{tractors}} and other heavy equipment learn to float the transmission {{in and out}} of gear, beginning with dis-engaging the clutch by pressing the clutch pedal only part way, enough to pull the transmission out of gear, re-engaging the clutch in neutral (between gears by letting the clutch pedal all the way back out) to let the engine revolutions decelerate enough for the idle sprockets to shift, and free gear shafts to slow their revolutions per minute (RPM), then dis-engage the clutch again (by pressing the clutch pedal only part way to the floor) a second time, and float the higher gear into engaging the <b>drive</b> <b>coupling</b> and flywheel and engaging the clutch plates. Professional operators of heavy equipment take extensive safety training before ever learning how to double-clutch. Once an operator is familiar with range, range selector, rpm, velocity, and torque of heavy equipment like an 18-wheeler, he can begin to anticipate when to shift gears. Operators become familiar with ranges of gears. They also learn not to leave their foot on the clutch while driving, because these types of transmissions use the clutch for some very different purposes. The depth the clutch is depressed to the floor will determine what the clutch will be doing as a synchronizing function.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{design and}} analysis of a z-axis tuning fork gyroscope. The sensor is designed to reduce noises and improve the sensitivity by using a <b>drive</b> <b>coupling</b> spring in the lozenge shape. The in-phase sensing mode is suppressed by using a self-rotation ring. The designed sensor prioritizes anti-phase driving and sensing modes. The frequencies of anti-phase driving and sensing modes are far from those of parasitic ones. The design also enables the sensing mode to decouple from the driving one, which is considered to decrease vibration-induced error. The proposed sensor structure is analyzed by finite element method. The simulated frequencies of the driving and sensing modes are 9. 9 and 10. 0 kHz, respectively, which show the bandwidth of sensor of 100 Hz. The frequency difference between the driving and sensing modes and the parasitic ones is obtained to be 50 %. The optimized gap between electrodes leads to {{the determination of the}} number of the sensing capacitor fingers and consequently the suitable dimension parameters of the whole device. The sensor performance in the time domain and the frequency domain having the transient response to a given rotation rate is also simulated showing the linear dependence of capacitance change on angular velocity.

40|$|Material {{models for}} the finite element {{analysis}} (FEA) of polymeric and elastomeric compounds are only available in limited form in most commercial finite element (FE) packages. The most common are the phenomenological Mooney-Rivlin and the Ogden models, for which the constants bear no relationship to the physical or chemical characteristics of the rubber and their derivation is difficult. Both models are limited in their accuracy for filled rubbers used in combined states of tensile and compressive deformation, and since these are common operational conditions for engineering components such as drive couplings, engine mounts and torsional vibration dampers, their use in engineering analyses is restricted. In this paper a statistical mechanics material modelling approach for synthetic, filled elastomeric compounds in FEA is presented. Using styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) as an example, the theory and its application in the commercially available ABAQUS {{finite element analysis program}} is explained. FE models of tensile and compressive specimens in two and three dimensions are used to demonstrate the use of the model, and results are presented, discussed and compared with measured data. Good correlation in both tension and compression is demonstrated. A practical application of the model to the SBR blocks in a Holset torsional <b>drive</b> <b>coupling</b> is presented; this analysis involves complex issues of mesh design and contact modelling. The results show good agreement with measured performance, and clearly demonstrate how this type of material modelling approach can be effectively used in the computer aided engineering and design of engineering rubber components...|$|E
40|$|The paper furthers the {{analysis}} of a recently proposed balancing methodology for high-speed, flexible shafts. This mechanism imparts corrective balancing moments, having the effect of simulating the fixing moments of equivalent double or single encastre mounted shafts. This is shown to theoretically eliminate/nullify the 1 st lateral critical speed (LCS), and thereby facilitate safe operation with reduced LCS margins. The paper extends previously reported research to encompass a more generalised case of multiple, concentrated, residual imbalances, thereby facilitating analysis of any imbalance distribution along the shaft. Solutions provide greater insight of the behaviour of the balancing sleeve concept, and the beneficial implications for engineering design. Specifically: 1) a series of concentrated imbalances {{can be regarded as}} an equivalent level of uniform eccentricity, and balance sleeve compensation is equally applicable to a generalised unbalanced distribution, 2) compensation depends on the sum of the applied balancing sleeve moments and can therefore be achieved using a single balancing sleeve (thereby simulating a single encastre shaft), 3) compensation of the 2 nd critical speed, {{and to a lesser extent}} higher orders, is possible by use of two balancing sleeves, positioned at shaft ends, 4) the concept facilitates on-site commissioning of trim balance which requires a means of adjustment at only one end of the shaft, 5) the Reaction Ratio, RR, (simply supported/ encastre), is independent of residual eccentricity, so that the implied benefits resulting from the ratio (possible reductions in the equivalent level of eccentricity) are additional to any balancing procedures undertaken prior to encastre simulation. Analysis shows that equivalent reductions in the order of 1 / 25 th, are possible. Experimental measurements from a scaled model of a typical <b>drive</b> <b>coupling</b> employed on an industrial gas turbine package, loaded asymmetrically with a concentrated point of imbalance, are used to support {{the analysis}} and conclusions...|$|E
40|$|Active {{motility}} {{in outer}} hair cells (OHCs) amplifies basilar-membrane (BM) and auditory-nerve (AN) responses to low-level sounds. The recent finding that medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferents (which innervate OHCs) inhibit AN initial peak (ANIP) responses from mid-to-high-level clicks, {{but do not}} inhibit initial BM responses, suggests a coupling of OHC motility to inner-hair-cell (IHC) stereocilia that is not through the BM. The main thesis objective was to test whether different OHC mechanisms produce AN responses to low-level sounds versus ANIP from mid-to-high-level clicks by comparing the suppressive effects of low-frequency "bias-tones" on these responses. Bias tones suppress by pushing OHC stereocilia into low-slope regions of their mechanoelectric transduction functions thereby lowering OHC amplification, particularly for probe tones near an AN-fiber's characteristic frequency (CF). This suppression occurs at opposite bias-tone phases, with one suppression typically larger than the other. Bias-tone effects were measured on cat AN-fiber responses using 50 Hz bias tones. In the first thesis part, bias-tone suppressive effects on AN responses to low-level clicks and low-level CF-tones {{were found to be}} similar, as expected but never previously shown. Then, in the main thesis focus, bias-tone suppressions of AN responses to low-level clicks and ANIP responses were studied. Both responses were suppressed twice each bias-tone cycle, but their major suppressions were at opposite bias-tone phases, which indicates that both ANIP and low-level AN responses depend on the slope of OHCstereocilia mechanoelectric-transduction, but with some significant difference. In the last thesis part, bias-tone suppression effects on low-CF (0. 7 octaves) tones were studied. Previous work found differences in AN-response group delays between CF and off-CF frequency regions that might arise from two different IHC-drive mechanisms, and the objective was to test this hypothesis. Our results showed similar bias-tone effects in both regions. Overall, the results demonstrate differences and similarities in the OHC mechanisms that produce ANIP and traditional, low-level cochlear amplification, and the results are consistent with the ANIP <b>drive</b> <b>coupling</b> OHC motility to IHC stereocilia without going through BM motion. by Hui S.

40|$|A few {{components}} and debris collected from an aeroengine retrieved {{from the wreckage}} of a crashed helicopter were sent to this laboratory for analysis. The items received for laboratory tests/investigation are: (a) <b>drive</b> sleeve, (b) <b>coupling</b> sleeve, (c) debris/deposits and (d) non-metallic pieces collected from {{various parts of the}} engine, and (e) metal pieces collected from magnetic chip detector (MCD). Debris collected from various parts of the engine was found to be either dust and soil or fragments of non-metallic fabric that was used {{in some parts of the}} engine. Compositional analysis confirmed that the metallic particles collected from the MCD were from the shaved off splines of <b>drive</b> and <b>coupling</b> sleeves. The mode of failure in the <b>drive</b> and <b>coupling</b> sleeves was identified to be progressive in nature. There were three fatigue cracks in the coupling sleeve; all of them being initiated at the spline root region. However, it is to be noted that no fracture was associated with these cracks. Hence, fatigue cracks per se were not responsible for the failure of the <b>drive</b> and <b>coupling</b> sleeves. Rather, evidences suggest that the fatigue crack initiation and propagation had occurred subsequent to some other mechanism of failure. It was not possible to unambiguously establish the mode of failure of the splines of the <b>drive</b> and <b>coupling</b> sleeves because of the severe destruction that took place following the failure. But, there were tell-tale marks on the working flank of the available portion of the splines, which were indicative of relative movement between these components in the axial direction. Considering the nature of failure in the present case, this assumes significance. Analysis shows that in the event of such movement, wear on the meshing surfaces of the splines is inevitable. As wear progresses, the clearance between the engaging splines increases. This induces cyclic load of higher magnitude on the splines which increases the vulnerability for fatigue crack initiation at the spline root region. Moreover, the wear on the splines results in loss of material and thereby reduces cross section of the splines. When the cross section reduces to critical limit such that the splines can no longer sustain the application load, they fold or shear off. Although direct evidences to this proposed mechanism is scarce on the component because of the post failure destruction, available signatures, however, point towards such a sequence of failure. This is further supported by metallurgical investigation wherein both <b>drive</b> and <b>coupling</b> sleeves were found conforming to the specifications with respect to (a) chemical composition, (b) microstructure, (c) surface treatment, and (d) hardness profile. The reason(s) for possible axial movement between the <b>drive</b> and <b>coupling</b> sleeves, however, could not be established from the laboratory investigation. In view of the progressive failure in the <b>drive</b> and <b>coupling</b> sleeves, it is justifiable to state that the failure in these components was primarily responsible for the sudden loss of power in the engine. This report provides a detailed account of laboratory investigation with test results and analysis. Also, a few recommendations are suggested for identification of probable cause(s) which could give rise to axial movement between <b>drive</b> and <b>coupling</b> sleeves...|$|R
