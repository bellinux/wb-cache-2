5|$|As the Sun expands, it will {{swallow the}} planets Mercury and Venus. Earth's fate is less clear; {{although}} the Sun will envelop Earth's current orbit, the star's loss of mass (and thus weaker gravity) {{will cause the}} planets' orbits to move <b>farther</b> <b>out.</b> If it were only for this, Venus and Earth would probably escape incineration, but a 2008 study suggests that Earth will likely be swallowed up {{as a result of}} tidal interactions with the Sun's weakly bound outer envelope.|$|E
5|$|For over a century, {{reports from}} the world's oceans have been {{received}} real-time for safety reasons and to help with general weather forecasting. The reports are coded using the synoptic code, and relayed via radio or satellite to weather organizations worldwide. Buoy reports are automated, and maintained by the country that moored the buoy in that location. Larger moored buoys are used near shore, while smaller drifting buoys are used <b>farther</b> <b>out</b> at sea.|$|E
5|$|Compositional mapping and Io's {{high density}} suggest that Io {{contains}} {{little to no}} water, though small pockets of water ice or hydrated minerals have been tentatively identified, most notably on the northwest flank of the mountain Gish Bar Mons. Io has {{the least amount of}} water of any known body in the Solar System. This lack of water is likely due to Jupiter being hot enough early {{in the evolution of the}} Solar System to drive off volatile materials like water in the vicinity of Io, but not hot enough to do so <b>farther</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E

About a month later she gave a talk on culinary choices for the heat of the summer in Chicago, and then a talk at a recital. Then she assists with an exhibition from artists in the public school system.|$|R
5|$|The two {{possible}} stacked forms differ in which pairs {{of the arms}} are stacked with each other; {{which of the two}} dominates is highly dependent on the base sequences nearest to the junction. Some sequences result in an equilibrium between the two conformers, while others strongly prefer a single conformer. In particular, junctions containing the sequence A-CC bridging the junction point appear to strongly prefer the conformer that allows a hydrogen bond to form between the second cytosine and one of the phosphates at the junction point. While most studies have focused on the identities of the four bases nearest to the junction on each arm, it is evident that bases <b>farther</b> <b>out</b> can also affect the observed stacking conformations.|$|E
5|$|There are {{different}} types of starts for races of different distances. Middle- and long-distance races mainly use the waterfall start. This is when all athletes begin on a curved line that moves <b>farther</b> <b>out</b> at {{the outer edge of}} the track. Competitors are allowed to move towards the inside lane right away, as long as it is safe to do so. For some middle-distance races, such as 800m, each athlete starts in their own lane. Once the gun fires, they must run in the lane they began in until markers on the track notify them it is time to move towards the inside lane. For sprint races, athletes begin in start blocks and must stay in their own lane for the entire race.|$|E
5|$|With a few exceptions, {{the farther}} a planet or belt {{is from the}} Sun, the larger the {{distance}} between its orbit and the orbit of the next nearer object to the Sun. For example, Venus is approximately 0.33 AU <b>farther</b> <b>out</b> from the Sun than Mercury, whereas Saturn is 4.3 AU out from Jupiter, and Neptune lies 10.5 AU out from Uranus. Attempts {{have been made to}} determine a relationship between these orbital distances (for example, the Titius–Bode law), but no such theory has been accepted. The images {{at the beginning of this}} section show the orbits of the various constituents of the Solar System on different scales.|$|E

5|$|Seventy-four of the 273 {{personnel}} from Evans {{were killed in}} the collision, with the majority of these believed to have been asleep or trapped inside the bow section, which sank within minutes. Melbourne deployed her boats, life rafts, and lifebuoys, before carefully manoeuvring alongside the stern section of Evans, where both ships' crews used mooring lines to lash the ships together. Sailors from Melbourne dived from the flight deck into the water to rescue overboard survivors close to the carrier, while the carrier's boats and helicopters collected those <b>farther</b> <b>out.</b> All of the survivors were located within 12 minutes of the collision and rescued before half an hour had passed, although the search continued for fifteen more hours. After Evans stern was evacuated, it was cast off, while the carrier moved away to avoid damage. The stern did not sink, and was later recovered, stripped of parts, and sunk for target practice.|$|E
5|$|Several {{stars with}} {{planetary}} systems lie within {{the borders of}} Circinus, although none of the host stars are particularly prominent. HD 134060 is a sun-like yellow dwarf star of spectral type G0VFe+0.4 and magnitude 6.29, around 79light-years away. Its two planets were discovered in 2011 through the radial velocity method: the smaller, HD 134060 b, has a mass of 0.0351MJ (Jupiter masses) and orbits its star every 3.27days, at 0.0444 AU; the larger, HD 134060 c (0.15MJ), orbits <b>farther</b> <b>out</b> at 2.226AU, with a period of approximately 1161 days. Even fainter, at magnitude 8.8, HD 129445 is 220light-years away and has 99% of the Sun's mass and a similar spectral type of G8V. HD 129445 b, a Jupiter-like planet (1.6 MJ) discovered in 2010 via the radial velocity method, orbits this star {{at a distance of}} 2.9 AU, approximately every 1840days.|$|E
5|$|The {{large amount}} of CO2 in the {{atmosphere}} together with water vapour and sulfur dioxide create a strong greenhouse effect, trapping solar energy and raising the surface temperature to around 740K (467°C), hotter than any other planet in the Solar System, even that of Mercury despite being located <b>farther</b> <b>out</b> from the Sun and receiving only 25% of the solar energy (per unit area) Mercury does. The average temperature on the surface is above the melting points of lead (600K, 327°C), tin (505K, 232°C), and zinc (693K, 420°C). The thick troposphere also makes the difference in temperature between {{the day and night}} side small, even though the slow retrograde rotation of the planet causes a single solar day to last 116.5 Earth days. The surface of Venus spends 58.3 days of darkness before the sun rises again behind the clouds.|$|E
50|$|Those {{advocating the}} {{apparent}} distance hypothesis might counter {{that in the}} Ponzo illusion, people do not perceive one line to actually be farther away than another either, or that everything on the horizon is perceived as <b>farther</b> away, <b>out</b> of the habit that {{this is true for}} every object ever seen there (average-altitude clouds are about 100 times farther away at the horizon than when overhead).|$|R

5|$|The {{silky shark}} {{is one of}} the three most common pelagic sharks along with the blue and oceanic whitetip sharks, and counts among the most {{numerous}} large oceanic animals in the world with a population of at least tens of millions. Compared to the other two species, it is less strictly pelagic with the greatest numbers found in offshore waters associated with land, where food is more readily obtained than <b>farther</b> <b>out</b> in the truly open ocean. The silky shark is an active, inquisitive, and aggressive predator, though it will defer to the slower but more powerful oceanic whitetip shark in competitive situations. When approaching something of interest, it may seem inattentive, sedately circling and sometimes swinging its head from side to side. However, it can respond with startling swiftness to any shift in its immediate surroundings. This shark is often found around floating objects such as logs or tethered naval buoys.|$|E
5|$|While {{the largely}} {{underground}} southern section will reach Ny Ellebjerg station from The Central Station by 2023. South of the Central Station will four new stations be built before the line terminus at Ny Ellebjerg. Three {{of these four}} stations will pass through the southern parts of Copenhagen's harbour. The northern terminus will presumably be moved farther and <b>farther</b> <b>out</b> at the peninsula, which constitutes {{a large part of}} Copenhagen's northern harbour part, as the city aims to rebuild typical harbour buildings with housing. However the political decisions on the M4 topic, so far only deals with a line with a total of 13 stations between Orientkaj and Ny Ellebjerg. In the end of 2019 will there be 4 Metro lines and 39 stations within the Copenhagen Metro system. And by 2023 will the Metro still comprises 4 lines, but 44 stations will be served instead of 39. Of the 44 stations in 2023, will 8 stations serve both Metro as well as S-train.|$|E

25|$|In the mid-1920s, large {{apartment}} buildings with first-floor commercial space were {{constructed in the}} area, bringing more residents into the area and reducing the pressure for store frontage. At the same time, the former residents of the upper-class, turn-of-the-century homes moved <b>farther</b> <b>out</b> into new neighborhoods such as Boston-Edison, Arden Park-East Boston, or Virginia Park. The remaining mansions were repurposed as boardinghouses or commercial space.|$|E
25|$|Although the SS class types proved invaluable, {{their use}} was {{restricted}} to coastal patrols in reasonably fair weather owing to their low engine power and comparatively small size. For work <b>farther</b> <b>out</b> at sea and in all weathers, three further classes were developed: the Coastal, the C* and North Sea-class ships. Each had larger engines and envelopes, carried more crew, and had greater patrol duration than the previous class ships.|$|E

25|$|Erosion {{accelerated}} up to twentyfold in the 3rd century, creating unusable marshlands, which spread {{diseases such}} as malaria. Flooding from runoff disrupted water supply to natural springs and rivers, but also increased siltation to coastal areas and harbors at river deltas. Rains washed away the unprotected earth and greatly altered coastlines, in some cases, pushing them many miles <b>farther</b> <b>out</b> to sea {{as in the case}} around the mouths of the Po River.|$|E
25|$|Part of {{the market}} sits on what was {{originally}} mudflats below the bluffs west of Pike Place. In the late 19th century, West Street (now Western Avenue, angling away from Pike Place) was already a through street running more or less parallel to the shore. Railroad Avenue (now Alaskan Way) was built <b>farther</b> <b>out</b> on pilings; it was not filled in until the 1930s.

25|$|According to {{extended}} habitable zone theory, planetary mass {{objects with}} atmospheres capable of inducing sufficient radiative forcing could possess liquid water <b>farther</b> <b>out</b> from the Sun.
