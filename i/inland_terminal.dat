40|$|The growing {{focus on}} inland/dry ports is {{indicative}} of transport development strategies gradually shifting inland to address capacity and efficiency issues in light of global supply chains. The complexity of modern freight distribution, the increased focus on intermodal transport solutions and capacity issues {{appear to be the}} main drivers. Also the larger volumes of flows in networks, through a concentration of cargo on a limited set of ports of call and associated trunk lines to the hinterland, have created the right condition for nodes to appear along {{and at the end of}} these trunk lines. In the light of technological, market and supply chain changes this paper looks at how <b>inland</b> <b>terminals</b> play a role in the organization of regional freight distribution. The first part aims at discussing the number of functions played by <b>inland</b> <b>terminals,</b> from satellite to gateway <b>terminals</b> to <b>inland</b> load centers.

5000|$|The {{building}} {{was designed by}} Lusby Simpson of Abbott, Merkt & Co. and completed in 1932. The building had a multipurpose design {{when it opened in}} 1932 with the first floor and basement designated as [...] "Union <b>Inland</b> <b>Terminal</b> #1" [...] which was to be used to transport goods by truck to and from railroad lines and/or shipping piers. The second floor was the Commerce section designed for exhibitions and the upper floors were designed for manufacturing. The Union <b>Inland</b> <b>Terminal</b> was built by the Port Authority to be a warehouse/union station to handle less than carload (LCL) shipments, consolidating the shipping functions of the Hudson River piers two blocks west of the building, the eight trunk railroads that operated a block west of the building and truck operations (an <b>inland</b> <b>terminal</b> by definition is a warehouse that is not immediately next to railroad lines/piers but is nearby and is used to relieve congestion at the transfer points).|$|E

40|$|With {{increasing}} maritime containerized transport, efficient seaport <b>terminals</b> and <b>inland</b> access {{are essential}} for the entire intermodal transportation chain to function. Improvement only in maritime transport and in seaport terminals without improvements in seaport inland access is not sufficient since a growth in the sea flow implies an almost proportional increase in the inland flow. Therefore, implementation of rail for connecting seaports with their hinterland through <b>inland</b> <b>terminals</b> would be the strategic decision. <b>Inland</b> <b>terminals</b> are of major importance for the efficiency of intermodal transport and for the efficiency of seaport inland access. This thesis deals with the dry port concept. The concept {{is based on a}} seaport directly connected by rail to <b>inland</b> intermodal <b>terminals,</b> where shippers can leave and/or collect their goods in intermodal loading units as if directly at the seaport. The seaport and the <b>inland</b> <b>terminals,</b> here denoted as dry ports, are connected with high capacity traffic modes, such as rail, rather than only with road. In addition to the transhipment that a conventional <b>inland</b> intermodal <b>terminal</b> provides, services such as storage, consolidation, depot, maintenance of containers, and customs clearance are usually available at dry ports. The purpose of the thesis is to present the dry port concept, to elaborate the dry port benefits from the perspectives of different actors of the system, and to identify and categorize existing and potential dry ports for the Port of Göteborg. Furthermore, the concept is evaluated from an environmental perspective using modelling and simulation on the case of the Port of Göteborg...|$|R
