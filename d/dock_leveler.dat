50|$|<b>Dock</b> <b>levelers</b> {{and lifts}} are {{generally}} permanent fixtures at each {{door of a}} dock. Dock plates and dock boards are generally, by contrast, portable, and not fixed either to dock or truck.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dock</b> <b>levelers</b> (and indeed <b>dock</b> {{plates and}} dock boards) are used where a {{building}} has a truck-level door, i.e. a {{door with a}} floor level roughly {{at the same height}} as the floor of the truck's trailer. Some buildings only have drive-in doors, i.e. doors at the same level as the ground outside of the building, suitable for driving directly into the building.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Dock</b> <b>leveler</b> - a height-adjustable {{platform}} used as {{a bridge}} between dock and truck, can be operated via mechanical (spring), hydraulic, or air powered systems.|$|E
50|$|Warehouses that handle {{palletized}} freight use a <b>dock</b> <b>leveler,</b> so items can {{be easily}} loaded and unloaded using power moving equipment (e.g. a forklift). When a truck backs into such a loading dock, the bumpers on the loading dock and the bumpers on the trailer come into contact but may leave a gap; also, the warehouse floor and the trailer deck may not be horizontally aligned. In North America, the most common dock height is 48 - 52 in, though heights of up to 55 in occur as well. A <b>dock</b> <b>leveler</b> bridges the gap between a truck and a warehouse to safely accommodate a forklift.|$|E
5000|$|Dock {{levelers}} {{are more}} expensive devices than the comparatively light-weight dock plates and dock boards. The {{most common form of}} <b>dock</b> <b>leveler</b> is the recessed, or pit, <b>dock</b> <b>leveler.</b> As the name suggests, this type of leveler is contained in a recess, or pit, beneath the dock door and floor surface. Dock levelers are stronger than dock plates and have similar ranges to dock boards, making them suitable not only for motorized fork lift trucks but also for master conveyors (for which neither dock plates or dock boards are suitable). Safety, also, is very high for this kind of product: Safety rules as EN1398 (European Standard) specifies the safety requirements for design, construction, installation, maintenance and testing of dock levelers and for safety components on dock levelers. NOTE: edge of dock levelers have fixed positions which have restricted ranges making them unsuitable for nonstandard dock heights.|$|E
50|$|In a loading dock, {{one problem}} to {{overcome}} {{is the problem}} of bridging the gap between a truck and the dock or warehouse floor. Not all trucks are the same height, and the height of the trailer floor within a truck can vary according to how heavily the truck is laden. Thus there is not only a gap to bridge but a height difference to overcome. Various devices are employed in order to achieve this: <b>dock</b> plates, <b>dock</b> <b>levelers,</b> <b>dock</b> boards, and various forms of lift. These devices vary in construction, suitability to dock conditions, cost of installation, and loading capacity.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dock</b> <b>levelers</b> are, as mentioned, {{fixed to}} the dock. They {{comprise}} a simple metal plate, called a lip, that is raised from a stowed position and then lowered {{onto the back of}} the truck. Lip can be hinged or telescopic type. They are operated either manually, via a simple pull chain, or hydraulically, (most common) with an electric pump driving a piston to lift the plate and another one to move the lip.|$|R

The new addition of the Exhibit Hall features 94695 sq ft, ceiling heights: 22 to 45 ft, a drive-in door: 20' x 16', and 6 loading <b>docks</b> with self-adjusting <b>levelers.</b> 100000 sq ft of parking lot/outdoor exhibit space was also added near the Exhibit Hall.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}}’s inaugural {{owner was}} Grinnell Fire Protection. The building was later purchased by United Metal and {{converted into a}} steel-manufacturing plant that supplied steel to many of DFW’s high-rise buildings, ballparks, and roller coasters. Several industrial features still occupy the building’s interiors, including the original beams, roof trusses, sliding doors, floors and drains, as well a loading dock, <b>dock</b> <b>leveler,</b> and industrial weighing scale.|$|E
50|$|Recessed dock {{levelers}} {{also have}} problems {{of exposure to}} the weather. However, because they are recessed into the dock, which is above ground level, they do not have as great a problem with drainage. Equally, because they are recessed into the dock, they extend partially back from the dock edge. A <b>dock</b> <b>leveler</b> can be installed so that it extends inside the loading dock door, and thus inside the building, protecting it from the weather.|$|E
50|$|There can be {{very serious}} {{accidents}} on loading bays. One example is trailer creep (also known as trailer walk, or dock walk), which occurs when the lateral and vertical forces exerted each time a forklift truck enters and exits the trailer cause the trailer to slowly {{move away from the}} dock, resulting in separation from the <b>dock</b> <b>leveler.</b> Factors that affect trailer creep are the weight and speed of the lift truck and load, the gradient of the ground the trailer is parked on, the condition of the suspension, tire air pressures, the type of transition being used (dock levelers, dock boards), and whether the trailer has been disconnected or if it is still connected to the tractor.|$|E
50|$|Other, less common, devices {{employed}} when {{bridging the}} gap between truck and <b>dock</b> are truck <b>levelers.</b> These are hydraulic lifts positioned beneath the rear wheels of the truck, {{that are used to}} raise and lower the truck so that it is level with the loading dock edge. The problems with truck levelers, that make them rarely employed, are twofold. First: They cause the truck interior to be at an incline, which causes loading and unloading difficulties. Second: They are expensive to maintain, since they require (being below ground level and open to the air) proper drainage and protection against the weather.|$|R
50|$|Because {{they carry}} heavy {{motorized}} equipment, the grade of the incline {{has to be}} shallow. The greater the height differential between truck and dock that a <b>dock</b> <b>leveler</b> can compensate for, the longer the leveler itself has to be. Moreover, the grade of the incline must not be {{so great that the}} vehicles cannot climb it. A height differential of between 7 and 8 inches generally requires a 6 ft leveler for an electric palette carrier. A height differential of between 17 and 18 inches generally requires a 12 ft leveler for a petrol-engined fork lift truck. Anyway, the lip has to be considered in the length of the leveler, as it is part of it. A telescopic lip (20 or 40 inches) can help to reduce the length of the leveler to 10 feet.|$|E
