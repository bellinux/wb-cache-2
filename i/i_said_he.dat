500|$|Jon Anderson has {{recalled}} how the 1981 album The Friends of Mr Cairo, which he produced with composer Vangelis inspired Thriller, and specifically [...] "Billie Jean". [...] "They took the riff {{and made it}} funky for Billie Jean. Quincy said he'd been recording our song [...] "State of Independence" [...] with Donna Summer, and <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> had an incredible guy singing backing vocals. He said, 'That guy was Michael – we were both digging your album.' So that's kinda cool, that cross-pollination in music." ...|$|E
500|$|Nelson's {{body was}} placed in a cask of brandy mixed with camphor and myrrh, which was then lashed to the Victory's {{mainmast}} and placed under guard. Victory was towed to Gibraltar after the battle, and on arrival the body was transferred to a lead-lined coffin filled with spirits of wine. Collingwood's dispatches about the battle were carried to England aboard , and when the news arrived in London, a messenger was sent to Merton Place to bring the news of Nelson's death to Emma Hamilton. She later recalled, They brought me word, Mr Whitby from the Admiralty. [...] "Show him in directly", <b>I</b> <b>said.</b> <b>He</b> came in, and with a pale countenance and faint voice, said, [...] "We have gained a great Victory." [...] – [...] "Never mind your Victory", I said. [...] "My letters – give me my letters" [...] – Captain Whitby was unable to speak – tears in his eyes and a deathly paleness over his face made me comprehend him. I believe I gave a scream and fell back, and for ten hours I could neither speak nor shed a tear.|$|E
500|$|Blount was undrafted in the 2010 NFL Draft but {{agreed in}} {{principle}} to a free agent contract with the San Francisco 49ers following the draft. However, after a meeting with Tennessee Titans head coach Jeff Fisher, Blount decided to sign as an undrafted free agent with the Titans instead. [...] In August 2010, Blount was involved in another incident in which he threw a punch, this time at teammate defensive end Eric Bakhtiari, a few moments after having his own helmet ripped off in practice. [...] Blount quickly talked to Titans head coach Jeff Fisher before leaving the field. [...] "He apologized, and <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> didn't have to apologize," [...] Fisher said. [...] "It's football. It's training camp[...] [...] [...] His past is his past. Is that the first punch you've seen in camp this year? No. I'm not disappointed whatsoever. I have great confidence in the young man that he learned from his mistake, and he's very competitive. That's why we brought him in here is to watch him run the football like that." [...] Blount survived the final roster cut and {{was placed on the}} Titans' 53-man roster. Blount was then waived by the team on September 5, 2010, to make room for veteran linebackers Tim Shaw (Chicago Bears) and Patrick Bailey (Pittsburgh Steelers). Titans sources indicated that Blount would be signed to the rookie practice squad if Blount cleared waivers, which he did not.|$|E
50|$|Well, {{the other}} day when I was out walking, I met my cousin Josef from Muck Meadow. I couldn't {{understand}} what was wrong, why he wasn't working, 'cause he'd been working for several years for that big farmer over at Sweet Ridge, so I asked him if he wasn't working there anymore. No, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> quit, <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> Really? You quit? <b>I</b> <b>said.</b> Yes, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> quit, <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> Oh, <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> but why did you quit? <b>I</b> <b>said.</b> Well, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> the food got so bad, <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> Really, <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> the food got so bad? <b>I</b> <b>said.</b> Yes, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> the food got so bad, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> so <b>I</b> had to quit, <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> You see, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> first the big cow died, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> and then we had to eat her up, he said; {{and then all of a}} sudden the big sow died, and then we had to eat her up, <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> But, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> finally the farmer's wife died, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> and — that's when <b>I</b> quit! <b>he</b> <b>said.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Romania had desired the {{outright}} {{abolition of}} the Danube River Commission since 1881, when King Carol <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> would insist on the mouths of the Danube, which ran through Romanian territory, being [...] "exclusively controlled by Romanian officials." [...] The country renewed its demands in 1919 at the Paris Peace Conference and in 1921 at a conference at which the Danube River Commission was renewed and strengthened as an independent agency.|$|E
2500|$|Sun Quan once said, [...] "A person {{improves}} as {{he grows}} older. Lü Meng and Jiang Qin are two excellent examples. They have obtained wealth and glory, {{yet they are}} willing to pick up reading and scholarly pursuits. They view material wealth lightly and value righteousness." [...] On another occasion, he said, [...] "When Ziming was young, <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> was someone who didn't give in to adversity, he was indeed courageous but only so. When he grew older, he became more knowledgeable and resourceful, and was second to Gongjin, but less capable in debate and literary arts as compared to Gongjin. When he defeated and captured Guan Yu, he did better than Lu Zijing." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the context}} of the 2008 Democratic Primary campaign, Morrison stated to Time magazine: [...] "People {{misunderstood}} that phrase. I was deploring the way in which President Clinton was being treated, vis-à-vis the sex scandal that was surrounding him. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> was being treated like a black on the street, already guilty, already a perp. I have no idea what his real instincts are, in terms of race." [...] In the Democratic primary contest for the 2008 presidential race, Morrison endorsed Senator Barack Obama over Senator Hillary Clinton, though expressing admiration and respect for the latter. When he won, Morrison said she felt like an American for the first time. She said, [...] "I felt very powerfully patriotic when I went to the inauguration of Barack Obama. I felt like a kid." ...|$|E

2500|$|Chapter 5 {{looks at}} the inanity of the society depicted, insofar as an {{intellectual}} discussion {{of the work of}} Chatterton between Obtuse Angle, Little Scopprell, Aradobo and Tilly Lally descends into farce; [...] "Obtuse Angle said in the first place you thought he was not [...] & then afterwards when <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> was not you thought he was not.
