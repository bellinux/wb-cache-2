25|$|Many <b>index</b> <b>funds</b> and {{exchange-traded}} funds {{attempt to}} replicate (before fees and expenses) {{the performance of}} the S500 by holding the same stocks as the index, in the same proportions. Many other mutual funds are benchmarked to the S500. Consequently, a company whose stock is added to the list of S500 stocks may see its stock price rise, as <b>index</b> <b>funds</b> must purchase that company's stock in order to continue tracking the S 500 index. Mutual fund managers provide <b>index</b> <b>funds</b> that track the S500, the first of which was The Vanguard Group's Vanguard500 in 1976.|$|E

But after removing the loading charge (up-front fee) only 72 underperformed while after removing brokerage costs only 58 underperformed.

25|$|An ETF {{combines}} the valuation feature of {{a mutual fund}} or unit investment trust, which can be bought or sold {{at the end of}} each trading day for its net asset value, with the tradability feature of a closed-end fund, which trades throughout the trading day at prices that may be more or less than its net asset value. Closed-end funds are not considered to be ETFs, even though they are funds and are traded on an exchange. ETFs have been available in the US since 1993 and in Europe since 1999. ETFs traditionally have been <b>index</b> <b>funds,</b> but in 2008 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission began to authorize the creation of actively managed ETFs.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} are: first, to know whether LQ- 45 <b>Index</b> <b>Fund</b> performs better than the equity mutual fund in Indonesian capital market; second, to measure the level of Indonesian capital efficiency. Results show that the raw performance and risk-adjusted performance of the LQ- 45 <b>Index</b> <b>Fund</b> {{is better than the}} performance of all equity mutual funds (concurrently). For the investors who wish to invest their capital in equity mutual fund, however, we have found two individual equity mutual fund which perform better than the LQ- 45 <b>Index</b> <b>Fund,</b> that is Phinisi Dana Saham and Rencana Cerdas. The result of this research also shows that the excess performance of the LQ- 45 <b>Index</b> <b>Fund</b> is smaller than the excess performance of (individual) equity mutual fund. From this result, we may conclude that Indonesian capital market is an inefficient capital market.   Keywords: Equity Mutual <b>Fund,</b> <b>Index</b> <b>Fund,</b> Efficiency Market</p...|$|R
25|$|Most ETFs are <b>index</b> <b>funds</b> {{that attempt}} to {{replicate}} {{the performance of a}} specific index. Indexes may be based on stocks, bonds, commodities, or currencies. An index fund seeks to track the performance of an index by holding in its portfolio either the contents of the index or a representative sample of the securities in the index. As of June 2012, in the United States, about 1200 index ETFs exist, with about 50 actively managed ETFs. Index ETF assets are about $1.2 trillion, compared with about $7 billion for actively managed ETFs. Some index ETFs, known as leveraged ETFs or inverse ETFs, use investments in derivatives to seek a return that corresponds to a multiple of, or the inverse (opposite) of, the daily performance of the index.|$|E
25|$|ETFs have a {{reputation}} for lower costs than traditional mutual funds. This will be evident as a lower expense ratio. This is mainly from two factors, the fact that most ETFs are <b>index</b> <b>funds</b> and some advantages of the ETF structure. However, this needs to be compared in each case, since some index mutual funds also have a very low expense ratio, and some ETFs' expense ratios are relatively high. An index fund is much simpler to run, since it does not require some security selection, and can be largely done by computer. Not only does an ETF have lower shareholder-related expenses, but because it does not have to invest cash contributions or fund cash redemptions, an ETF does not have to maintain a cash reserve for redemptions and saves on brokerage expenses. Mutual funds can charge 1% to 3%, or more; index fund expense ratios are generally lower, while ETFs are almost always less than 1%. Over the long term, these cost differences can compound into a noticeable difference.|$|E

2500|$|Towards {{his later}} life, {{particularly}} following {{the global financial}} crisis of 2007-08, Buffett became an increasingly vocal critic of active management, i.e., mutual funds and hedge funds. Buffett is skeptical that active management and stock-picking can outperform {{the market in the}} long run, and has advised both individual and institutional investors to move their money to low-cost <b>index</b> <b>funds</b> that track broad, diversified stock market indices. Buffett said in one of his letters to shareholders that [...] "when trillions of dollars are managed by Wall Streeters charging high fees, it will usually be the managers who reap outsized profits, not the clients." [...] In 2007, Buffett made a bet with numerous managers that a simple S 500 index fund will outperform hedge funds that charge exorbitant fees. By 2017, the index fund was outperforming every hedge fund that had made the bet against Buffett by a significant margin.|$|E
