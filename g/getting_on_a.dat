25|$|When {{the people}} of Quanzhou, Fujian could not raise enough money to build a bridge, Guanyin changed into a {{beautiful}} maiden. <b>Getting</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> boat, she offered to marry any man who could hit her {{with a piece of}} silver {{from the edge of the}} water. Due to many people missing, she collected a large sum of money in her boat. However, Lü Dongbin, one of the Eight Immortals, helped a merchant hit Guanyin in the hair with silver powder, which floated away in the water. Guanyin bit her finger and a drop of blood fell into the water, but she vanished. This blood was swallowed by a washer woman, who gave birth to Chen Jinggu (陳靖姑) or Lady Linshui (臨水夫人); the hair was turned into a female white snake and sexually used men and killed rival women. The snake and Chen were to be mortal enemies. The merchant was sent to be reborn as Liu Qi (劉杞).|$|E

500|$|Not Your Kind of People is {{the fifth}} studio album by Scottish-American {{alternative}} rock band Garbage. It was released on May 11, 2012 through the band's own record label, Stunvolume. The album marks {{the return of the}} band after a seven-year hiatus that started with previous album Bleed Like Me. Guitarist Duke Erikson said at the launch of the record that [...] "working with Garbage again was very instinctual. Like <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> bicycle...with three other people." [...] The band emphasized that {{they did not want to}} reinvent themselves, but embrace their sonic identity, reflecting their classic sound whilst updating it for 2012. Although Shirley Manson's morose dispositions have a presence on the record, many of the songs share a more optimistic outlook on life, influenced by some of Manson's personal experiences during their hiatus.|$|E

500|$|After touring {{in support}} of Ultramega OK the band signed with A Records, which caused a rift between Soundgarden and its {{traditional}} audience. Thayil said, [...] "In the beginning, our fans came from the punk rock crowd. They abandoned us when they thought we sold out the punk tenets, <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> major label and touring with Guns N' Roses. There were fashion issues and social issues, and people thought we no longer belonged to their scene, to their particular sub-culture." [...] The band later began work on its first album for a major label, but personnel difficulties caused {{a shift in the}} band's songwriting process, according to Cornell: [...] "At the time Hiro [...] excommunicated himself from the band and there wasn't a free-flowing system as far as music went, so I ended up writing a lot of it." [...] On September 5, 1989, the band released its second album, Louder Than Love, which saw it take [...] "a step toward the metal mainstream," [...] according to Steve Huey of Allmusic, describing it as [...] "a slow, grinding, detuned mountain of Sabbath/Zeppelin riffs and Chris Cornell wailing". Because of some of the lyrics, most notably on [...] "Hands All Over" [...] and [...] "Big Dumb Sex", the band faced various retail and distribution problems upon the album's release. Louder Than Love became the band's first album to chart on the Billboard 200, peaking at number 108 on the chart in 1990.|$|E
500|$|A post on Garbage's Facebook page on January 23, 2012 {{announced}} that the band launched their own record label, Stunvolume, to self-release their new studio album, distributed in the United States by Fontana. Overseas distribution deals were made with Cooperative Music, Liberator Music, Sony Music Japan and Universal Canada. On March 7, 2012, Garbage confirmed the album track listing via YouTube. Four further tracks recorded for the deluxe edition were confirmed later in a press release issued through the band's own label. In the United Kingdom, 250 copies of the deluxe edition were signed by Garbage and issued {{as part of the}} Record Store Day campaign. The album had a worldwide release date of May 14, 2012. At the launch of the record, guitarist Duke Erikson said that [...] "working with Garbage again was very instinctual. Like <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> bicycle... with three other people"; Erikson added, [...] "We haven't felt this good about a Garbage record since the last one." [...] Los Angeles-based studio SMOG Design handled the album's artwork and creative campaign, featuring band photographs by Autumn de Wilde. According to Duke Erikson, for the cover [...] "there was some art that we wanted to do but we didn't want to spend what the artist wanted us to", so instead of [...] "a very colorful and complex cover" [...] they opted to go the other way and be simplistic, with only a lowercase [...] "g".|$|E

2500|$|The {{character}} {{served as}} Walford's GP for 14 years. Although {{his first name}} of Harold was revealed by the visiting DI Marsh (Harry Miller) in the final scene of the show's second episode in 1985, {{he has always been}} referred to by the majority of the other characters and in the closing credits as [...] "Dr Legg". Though a regular character with his own storylines throughout the 1980s, for much of the 1990s he was a recurring character, making increasingly sporadic appearances, and only when other characters needed medical assistance. In 1998, the executive producer of EastEnders, Matthew Robinson, announced that he was officially retiring Dr Legg. The character was one of many axed by the producer, who was dubbed the [...] "axeman" [...] by the British press. Speaking of his decision, Robinson commented [...] "Dr Legg is <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> bit, so we're retiring him. He'll be going to a nice cottage in the country." [...] His place was filled by a younger alternative medicine fan, Dr Fred Fonseca, played by Jimi Mistry. Leonard Fenton has since spoken about his frustration that Dr Legg did not get to practice enough, claiming that he [...] "was frustrated for years by Dr Legg's sporadic appearances". In an interview in 2000, Fenton commented [...] "I told them I wasn't happy about going on once every two months. That's why it ended...". Dr Legg was never given an official exit on-screen, his retirement is mentioned by Dr Fonseca in January 1999, when the character Ruth Fowler (Caroline Paterson) requests to see him.|$|E
