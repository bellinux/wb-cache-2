50|$|In {{agriculture}} and gardening, mulch is a protective cover {{placed over the}} soil. Any material or combination {{can be used as}} mulch, such as stones, leaves, cardboard, wood <b>chips,</b> <b>gravel,</b> etc., though in permaculture mulches of organic material are the most common because they perform more functions. These include absorbing rainfall, reducing evaporation, providing nutrients, increasing organic matter in the soil, feeding and creating habitat for soil organisms, suppressing weed growth and seed germination, moderating diurnal temperature swings, protecting against frost, and reducing erosion. Sheet mulching is an agricultural no-dig gardening technique that attempts to mimic natural processes occurring within forests. Sheet mulching mimics the leaf cover that is found on forest floors. When deployed properly and in combination with other Permacultural principles, it can generate healthy, productive and low maintenance ecosystems.|$|R

[...] School of Computing and Engineering. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2014 Silica fume {{has long been}} used as a supplementary cementing material to provide a high density, high strength, and durable building material. Silica fume has a particle size a fraction of any conventional cement, which allows it to increase concrete strength by decreasing the porosity especially near the aggregates surface. Because Portland Cement Pervious Concrete (PCPC) has a smaller bond area between aggregate and paste, silica fume has significant impacts on the properties of the PCPC. The research in this paper studies the workability of a cement paste containing silica fume in addition to analyzing the results of testing on Portland Cement Pervious Concrete mixtures that also contained silica fume. Testing conducted included a study of the effects of silica fume on cement's rheological properties at various dosage rates ranging from zero to ten percent by mass. It was determined that silica fume has negligible effects on the viscosity of cement paste until a dosage rate of five percent, at which point the viscosity increases rapidly. In addition to the rheological testing of the cement paste, trials were also conducted on the pervious concrete samples. Sample groups included mixes with river <b>gravel</b> and <b>chipped</b> limestone as aggregate, washed and unwashed, and two different void contents. Workability tests showed that mixtures containing a silica fume dosage rate of 5 percent or less had comparable or slightly improved workability when compared to control groups. Workability was found to decrease at a 7 percent dosage rate. Samples were tested for compressive strength at 7 and 28 days and splitting tensile strength at 28 days. It was found in most sample groups, strength increased with dosage rates of 3 to 5 percent but often decreased when the dosage reached 7 percent. Abrasion testing showed that both samples containing washed aggregate and samples containing silica fume exhibited a reduced mass lossAbstract [...] Contents [...] List of illustrations [...] List of tables - Acknowledgements [...] Introduction [...] Literature review [...] Materials [...] Mixture proportions [...] Mixing methods [...] Test methods [...] Results and discussion [...] Conclusions [...] Future testing [...] Reference...|$|R
40|$|Different mulches have {{variable}} {{effects on}} soil physical properties and plant growth. This study aimed {{to compare the}} effects of mulching with inorganic (round gravel, RG), organic (wood chips, WC), and living (manila turf grass, MG) materials on soil properties at 0 - 5 -cm and 5 - 10 -cm depths, {{as well as on}} the growth and physiological features of Osmanthus fragrans L. 'Rixianggui' plants. Soil samples were collected at three different time points from field plots of O. fragrans plants treated with the different mulching treatments. Moisture at both soil depths was significantly higher after mulching with RG and WC than that in the unmulched control (CK) treatment. Mulching did not affect soil bulk density, pH, or total nitrogen content, but consistently improved soil organic matter. The available nitrogen in the soil increased after RG and WC treatments, but decreased after MG treatment during the experimental period. Mulching improved plant growth by increasing root activity, soluble sugar, and chlorophyll a content, as well as by providing suitable moisture conditions and nutrients in the root zone. Plant height and trunk diameter were remarkably increased after mulching, especially with RG and WC. However, while MG improved plant growth at the beginning of the treatment, the 'Rixianggui' plants later showed no improvement in growth. This was probably because MG competed with the plants for water and available nitrogen in the soil. Thus, our findings suggest that RG and WC, but not MG, improved the soil environment and the growth of 'Rixianggui' plants. Considering the effect of mulching on soil properties and plant growth and physiology, round <b>gravel</b> and wood <b>chips</b> appear to be a better choice than manila turf grass in 'Rixianggui' nurseries. Further studies are required to determine the effects of mulch quality and mulch-layer thickness on shoot and root growths...|$|R

Gravel is the most popular form of wetland fill medium, but tire chips provide more porosity, are less dense, and cheaper. Before spray application, wetland effluent must be disinfected (traditionally by chlorine). This study determines the treatment efficiency of SFCWs filled with <b>gravel</b> or tire <b>chip</b> media to treat domestic wastewater and the effectiveness of ultraviolet (UV) light in effluent disinfection. The influent and effluent of six SFCWs filled with tire chip medium and six SFCWs filled with gravel were monitored for six to twelve months. Parameters measured included pH, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD?), total and volatile suspended solids, NH?, P, and fecal and total coliforms. Differences between medium types in wetland performance were found for the parameters of BOD? and P, in which tire <b>chip</b> wetlands outperformed <b>gravel</b> wetlands. The average percent reduction for BOD? and P in the tire-chip filled wetlands was 86 and 65 %, respectively, compared to 72 and 32 % in the gravel-filled wetlands. The higher reduction in BOD? in the tire chip wetlands {{may be due to the}} prolonged detention time of the wastewater caused by higher pore volume. Soluble P was reduced more efficiently in the tire chip wetlands, most likely because iron in the wires of steel belted tires complexed with P to create an insoluble compound. There was no correlation between temperature and BOD? reduction. Because chlorination generates toxic byproducts, UV disinfection may be a better alternative. Two low pressure (254 nm) and two medium pressure UV bulbs (190 to 400 nm) were used to determine disinfection efficiency. Upon installation, all units disinfected effluent successfully. After two weeks in operation, three of the four units were failing due to decreased light intensity from films that developed on bulbs. One unit consistently disinfected water for one year without maintenance. Ultraviolet disinfection, as utilized, was not suitable for use with SFCWs because of inconsistency in disinfection. Tire chips may be a better fill medium for SFCWs than gravel because of higher porosity, lower cost, and greater reduction of P in effluent...|$|R
40|$|Nitrate (NO 3) {{loadings}} from stormwater runoff promote eutrophication in surface waters. Low Impact Development (LID) {{is a type}} of best {{management practice}} aimed at restoring the hydrologic function of watersheds and removing contaminants before they are discharged into ground and surface waters. Also known as rain gardens, a bioretention system is a LID technology that is capable of increasing infliltration, reducing runoff rates and removing pollutants. They can be planted with visually appealing vegetation, which plays a role in nutrient uptake. A modified bioretention system incorporates a submerged internal water storage zone (IWSZ) that includes an electron donor to support denitrification. Modified (or denitrifying) bioretention systems {{have been shown to be}} capable of converting NO 3 in stormwater runoff to nitrogen gas through denitrification; however, design guidelines are lacking for these systems, particularly under Florida-specific hydrologic conditions. The experimental portion of this research investigated the performance of denitrifying bioretention systems with varying IWSZ medium types, IWSZ depths, hydraulic loading rates and antecedent dry conditions (ADCs). Microcosm studies were performed to compare denitrification rates using wood <b>chips,</b> <b>gravel,</b> sand, and mixtures of wood chips with sand or gravel media. The microcosm study revealed that carbon-containing media, acclimated media and lower initial dissolved oxygen concentrations will enhance NO 3 removal rates. The gravel-wood medium was observed to have high NO 3 removal rates and low final dissolved organic carbon concentrations compared to the other media types. The gravel-wood medium was selected for subsequent storm event and tracer studies, which incorporated three completely submerged columns with varying depths. Even though the columns were operated under equivalent detention times, greater NO 3 removal efficiencies were observed in the taller compared to the shorter columns. Tracer studies revealed this phenomenon was attributed to the improved hydraulic performance in the taller compared to shorter columns. In addition, greater NO 3 removal efficiencies were observed with an increase in ADCs, where ADCs were positively correlated with dissolved organic carbon concentrations. Data from the experimental portion of this study, additional hydraulic modeling development for the unsaturated layer and unsaturated layer data from other studies were combined to create nitrogen loading model for modified bioretention systems. The processes incorporated into the IWSZ model include denitrification, dispersion, organic media hydrolysis, oxygen inhibition, bio-available organic carbon limitation and Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN) leaching. For the hydraulic component, a unifying equation was developed to approximate unsaturated and saturated flow rates. The hydraulic modeling results indicate that during ADCs, greater storage capacities are available in taller compared to shorter IWSZs Data from another study was used to develop a pseudo-nitrification model for the unsaturated layer. A hypothetical case study was then conducted with SWMM- 5 software to evaluate nitrogen loadings from various modified bioretention system designs that have equal IWSZ volumes. The results indicate that bioretention systems with taller IWSZs remove greater NO 3 loadings, which was likely due to the greater hydraulic performance in the taller compared to shorter IWSZ designs. However, the systems with the shorter IWSZs removed greater TKN and total nitrogen loadings due to the larger unsaturated layer volumes in the shorter IWSZ designs...|$|R
