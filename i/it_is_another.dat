5|$|In August, Marsden reappears when Ben confesses Heather's murder. She {{does not}} believe his confession, {{thinking}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>another</b> lie to get attention from Phil. However, Ben is {{arrested and charged with}} the murder after Marsden helps DS Luke Crisp (Rufus Wright) convince Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick) to implicate Ben as Heather's killer.|$|E
5|$|Homer, having {{forgotten}} Marge's birthday, rushes {{out to buy}} her {{a present}} at the Springfield Mall. He finds a bowling ball and decides to buy it for her. During the night of her birthday dinner at the Singing Sirloin, Marge is happy with the kids' presents of French perfume from Bart and a macaroni and glue card of her as the Mona Lisa from Lisa. However, she is offended by Homer's gift as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>another</b> demonstration of his thoughtless gift giving history, which her sisters Patty and Selma Bouvier had reminded her of earlier. To make matters worse, as he presents his 'gift', it bursts through its box and squashes Marge's birthday cake. Deeply resentful, Marge reminds him that not only has she never gone bowling in her life, but the ball is also inscribed with his name.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Burns reveals to Smithers that {{he misses}} his {{cherished}} bear Bobo and desperately wants it back {{but has no}} idea where <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> <b>Another</b> flashback reveals Bobo's history: after Mr. Burns leaves it behind, the bear eventually finds its way to Charles Lindbergh, who tosses the bear into a crowd, where it is caught by Adolf Hitler. In 1945, Hitler blames Bobo for losing World War II and tosses him away. Bobo is seen again in 1957 on board the USS Nautilus headed for the North Pole. Bobo becomes encased in a block of ice until picked up by an ice-gathering expedition in 1993. The bag of ice with Bobo in it {{is sent to the}} Kwik-E-Mart in Springfield. Bart buys the bag of ice, finds Bobo inside and gives it to Maggie to play with.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> {{chapter in}} the making of a {{business}} woman, that spring of happiness and new stirrings in the Home Club; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> term in the unplanned, uninstructed, muddling, chance-governed college which civilization unwittingly keeps for the training {{of men and women who}} will carry on the work of the world.|$|R
60|$|MRS. ARBUTHNOT. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> not I {{who made}} him see <b>it.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>another.</b>|$|R
60|$|I {{reflected}} {{a moment on}} this, for <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> sensible remark.|$|R
25|$|Balder is Norse Baldr. Phol is the {{masculine}} form of Uolla, but the context {{makes clear that}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>another</b> name of Balder.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>another</b> fasting puja {{of similar}} {{austerity}} {{for women of}} the area. The Puo-Juntia festival is observed by mothers to invoke the grace of Lord Dutibahana for the long life and prosperity of their sons.|$|E
25|$|The Nuberg competition, {{established}} in 2006, selects winners {{from among the}} newly composed work commissioned by the orchestra during the previous year. Given the short lifespan of individual concerts, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>another</b> means of providing young composers with valuable and generally hard-to-find exposure.|$|E
50|$|Building 9 <b>is</b> <b>another</b> low {{circular}} platform. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> {{shrine to}} Ehecatl, {{slightly larger than}} the similar Building 7.|$|R

25|$|In the 1960s {{physicists}} {{realized that}} QED broke down at extremely high energies. From this inconsistency the Standard Model of particle physics was discovered, which remedied the higher energy breakdown in theory. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>another,</b> extended {{quantum field theory}} which unifies the electromagnetic and weak interactions into one theory. This is called the electroweak theory.|$|E
25|$|The {{reordering}} of open-strings in left-handed tunings has {{an important}} consequence. The chord fingerings for the right-handed tunings must be changed for left-handed tunings. However, the left-handed involute of a regular tuning is easily recognized: <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>another</b> regular tuning. Thus the chords for the involuted regular-tuning {{may be used for}} the left-handed involute of a regular tuning.|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} {{possibility is}} the undeciphered Rongorongo script of Easter Island. It is debated {{whether this is}} true writing and, if it is, whether <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>another</b> case of cultural diffusion of writing. The oldest example is from 1851, 139 years after their first contact with Europeans. One {{explanation is that the}} script was inspired by Spain's written annexation proclamation in 1770.|$|E

25|$|Tecomella undulata is {{one more}} tree species, locally known as Rohida, which is found in Thar Desert regions of {{northwest}} and western India. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>another</b> important medium-sized tree of great use in Agroforestry, that produces quality timber and is {{the main source of}} timber amongst the indigenous tree species of desert regions. The trade name of the tree species is Desert teak or Marwar teak.|$|E
25|$|Formerly called Central Park, Kannowski Park {{is located}} {{just south of}} Downtown Grand Forks. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>another</b> park {{established}} early in city history. The small park features a playground, restrooms, and picnic areas. The park was recently renamed Kannowski Park in honor of Frances Kannowski, superintendent of the Grand Forks Park District from 1933 to 1953. Kannowski was the first female superintendent of a park district in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Formerly {{owned by}} the abbey at Cluny, Auxey was once the site of many watermills powered by the river Clous. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>another</b> of those appellations that is less well known, as its wines used to be sold as Volnay or Pommard. It has 32ha of Premier Crus within its 170ha, and the {{significant}} plantings of Chardonnay tells {{us that we are}} about to enter white wine territory.|$|E

25|$|It is {{one thing}} to worship a picture, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>another</b> by means of {{pictures}} to learn thoroughly the story that should be venerated. For what writing makes present to those reading, the same picturing makes present to the uneducated, to those perceiving visually, because in it the ignorant see what they ought to follow, in it they read who do not know letters. Wherefore, and especially for the common people, picturing is the equivalent of reading.|$|E
25|$|Pursuant to , <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>another</b> felony for a felon {{to possess}} a firearm in the United States, and terms of {{probation}} for felons typically include a prohibition on possessing firearms. But {{it is not necessarily}} required for nonviolent misdemeanants. It was permitted for a federal court to prohibit an Indian boy {{to possess a}} firearm until age 21, even though it impinged on his religious rite of passage of participation in a tribal hunt.|$|E
25|$|As {{the team}} has breakfast the {{following}} morning, a figure of a 13-year-old human boy appears on the base. Popov ignores it assuming that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>another</b> one of his hallucinations. However, the other people see the boy too. They try to follow him but the boy quickly leaves the premises and the explorers lose his track. The team sends a report back to the orbital base. They receive a reply from Leonid Gorbovsky. The mission of ER-2 is changed to establish contact with a possible alien race.|$|E

25|$|The {{value of}} the short Vita Tibulli, found {{at the end of}} the Ambrosian, Vatican and {{inferior}} manuscripts, has been much discussed. There is little in it that we could not infer from Tibullus himself and from what Horace says about Albius, though it is possible that its compiler may have taken some of his statements from Suetonius's book De Poetis. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>another</b> moot question of some importance whether our poet should be identified with the Albius of Horace (Od. i. 33; Epist. i. 4), as is done by the Horatian commentator Pomponius Porphyrion (AD 200-250) in his Scholia. Porphyrio's view was examined by Postgate (Selections from Tibullus, appendix A).|$|E
25|$|The last Alpine, an A610, {{rolled off}} the Dieppe line on 7 April, 1995, Renault abandoning the Alpine name. This was always {{a problem in the}} UK market. Alpines could not be sold in the UK under their own name because Sunbeam owned the trade mark (because of the mid-50s Sunbeam Alpine Mk I). In the 1970s, for example Dieppe were {{building}} modified Renault 5s for the worldwide market. The rest of the world knew them as R5 Alpines but in the UK they had to be renamed to R5 Gordini. With the numerous company takeovers that have occurred, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>another</b> French company, PSA Peugeot Citroën, who now own the British Alpine trademark.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of other {{distinguished}} homes in the district including the John and Jennie Keyes House, built in 1913. It is a two-story Craftsman style home located on Riverside Boulevard. The home was designed by Bend’s most prominent architect of the time, J. W. Dimick. The James and Ruth Overturf House was built in 1916. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>another</b> craftsman style bungalow located on Congress Street. In 2002, the house was carefully restored to its original architectural design. The Samuel Blakely House was built in 1919. It is a restored Craftsman bungalow located on Congress Street. Finally, the Fredrick and Myrtle Lieuallen House on Riverside Boulevard is a beautiful Tudor-style home built in 1926.|$|E
