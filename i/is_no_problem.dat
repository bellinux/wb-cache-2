Quatermass leaves the inquiry, then returns with Fowler to find that Broadhead has been 'marked' and now claims there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> with the project. Fowler takes Quatermass to meet with civil servant Rupert Ward, who {{has the authority to}} inspect the plant. Back at the Rocket Group, Leo and Paula deduce and discover with a radio telescope that an asteroid is orbiting the Earth invisibly and discharging the meteorites when it reaches the near point, 400 000 miles over Southern England every 14 hours.|$|E

25|$|The ball {{travels in}} the air, {{and there is}} no net force upon it. To the {{stationary}} observer the ball follows a straight-line path, so there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> squaring this trajectory with zero net force. However, the rotating observer sees a curved path. Kinematics insists that a force (pushing {{to the right of the}} instantaneous direction of travel for a counter-clockwise rotation) must be present to cause this curvature, so the rotating observer is forced to invoke a combination of centrifugal and Coriolis forces to provide the net force required to cause the curved trajectory.|$|E
25|$|The {{open circuit}} demand system {{exhausts}} gas {{to the environment}} at ambient pressure (or a very small difference from ambient pressure required to open the exhaust valve). As a result, all exhaled gas is lost to the surroundings. For most surface orientated commercial diving where air is the breathing gas in use, this <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem,</b> as air is cheap and freely available. Even with nitrox it is generally more cost effective to use open circuit, as oxygen is an easily available and relatively inexpensive gas, and blending nitrox is technologically simple, both to mix and to analyse.|$|E
25|$|An {{implicit}} character encoding, {{along with}} the fact that the code position of the euro sign is different in common encoding schemes, led to many problems displaying the euro sign in computer applications. While displaying the euro sign <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> as long as only one system is used (provided an up-to-date font with the proper glyph is available), mixed setups often produced errors. One example is a content management system where articles are stored in a database using a different character set than the editor's computer. Another is legacy software which could only handle older encodings such as ISO 8859-1 that contained no euro sign at all. In such situations, character set conversions had to be made, often introducing conversion errors such as a question mark (?) being displayed instead of a euro sign.|$|E

25|$|Under normal circumstances, a tiny {{amount of}} urobilinogen, if any, is {{excreted}} in the urine. If the liver's function is impaired or when biliary drainage is blocked, {{some of the}} conjugated bilirubin leaks out of the hepatocytes and appears in the urine, turning it dark amber. However, in disorders involving hemolytic anemia, an increased number of red blood cells are broken down, causing {{an increase in the}} amount of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood. Because the unconjugated bilirubin is not water-soluble, one will not see an increase in bilirubin in the urine. Because there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> with the liver or bile systems, this excess unconjugated bilirubin will go through all of the normal processing mechanisms that occur (e.g., conjugation, excretion in bile, metabolism to urobilinogen, reabsorption) and will show up as an increase in urine urobilinogen. This difference between increased urine bilirubin and increased urine urobilinogen helps to distinguish between various disorders in those systems.|$|E

[...] In reply, Junichi Okumura, a [...] Naha District deputy chief prosecutor stated, [...] "Here in Japan, unlike the United States, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> if evidence is submitted later".
