In this case, the supply line becomes an [...] "island" [...] with power surrounded by a [...] "sea" [...] of unpowered lines. For this reason, solar inverters that are designed to supply power to the grid are generally required to have automatic anti-islanding circuitry in them. In intentional islanding, the generator disconnects from the grid, and forces the <b>distributed</b> <b>generator</b> to power the local circuit. This is often used as a power backup system for buildings that normally sell their power to the grid.|$|E

40|$|The {{worldwide}} {{concern about}} the environments and the moves to dramatically increase the use of renewable energy for the generation of electricity has led to significant emphasis on distributed generation. Distributed generation brings many benefits to both of system operators and consumers, however, there are several difficulties and problems involved when connecting it into the local distribution system. Conventionally, a gird connected <b>distributed</b> <b>generator</b> is controlled using either constant power factor mode or constant VAR control mode.

40|$|Bibliography: pages 164 - 167. This thesis {{describes}} {{an investigation into}} the stability of distribution networks that are connected with <b>distributed</b> <b>generators.</b> Due to the restructuring of the electricity industry in the region as well as environmental concerns, distributed generation is bound to increase at a higher rate in the Southern African region in the near future. Southern Africa, like many other developing regions, is dominated by electrically weak distribution networks that have relatively high impedance lines. These networks suffer extreme voltage fluctuations when a transient disturbance occurs on the network. The <b>distributed</b> <b>generators</b> are connected onto distribution networks that were designed to operate without any generation, but were designed to receive power from the transmission networks. Once <b>distributed</b> <b>generators</b> are connected to distribution networks, a number of technical challenges are presented. One of the technical challenges includes investigating the stability of distribution networks connected with distributed generation. It would be beneficial to know what effect the connection of <b>distributed</b> <b>generators</b> onto distribution networks would have on the system stability. This is because if the connection of <b>distributed</b> <b>generators</b> onto distribution networks increases instability on the network, the quality of supply of that network would be degraded, therefore the connection of <b>distributed</b> <b>generators</b> must be limited or methods of improving the stability must be implemented. It is important to establish the measures that can be taken {{to make sure that the}} generators react in a stable manner when subjected to disturbances and to make sure that the local system stability is not compromised. The first objective of this thesis was to identify the types of generators that are likely to be connected to Southern African distribution networks and investigate their stability. The next objective was to design model distribution networks that would be utilised to highlight key stability issues that are raised when distributed generation is connected to distribution networks. The third objective was to conduct and analyse stability studies on model as well as existing Southern African distribution networks connected with distributed generation, including the assessment of the implications of potential instability such as on the quality of supply. The last objective was to identify various ways of improving the stability of distribution networks that are connected with distributed generation...|$|R

The need to operate the power system economically and with optimum levels of reliability has further led to an increase in interest in Distributed Generation. However it is important to place <b>Distributed</b> <b>Generator</b> on an optimum location so that the purpose of loss minimization and voltage regulation is dully served on the feeder. This paper investigates the impact of DG units installation on electric losses, reliability and voltage profile of distribution networks.

Islanding occurs when {{a portion of the}} distribution system becomes electrically isolated from the remainder of the power system yet continues to be energized by distributed generators. An important requirement to interconnect a DG to power distributed system is the capability of the DG to detect islanding detection.
