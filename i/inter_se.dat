25|$|The Supreme Court's {{ruling in}} Colorado River {{motivated}} the Montana Legislature to enact critical {{amendments to the}} MWUA in 1979. In 1977, the DNRC began pressing for a general water adjudication law. The agency proposed that anyone who failed to register their water claim with the state would lose that claim. It recommended against {{the creation of a}} water court, and instead argued for an administrative process overseen by the agency itself. The subsequent adjudication would be <b>inter</b> <b>se,</b> to meet the requirements of the McCarran Act. Rather than act on the DNRC's proposals, the state legislature established a study committee to make recommendations to the legislature at its next session (to be held in 1979). On April 4, 1979, the legislature voted to include tribal and federal as part of the state's adjudication process. The following day, the federal governments filed four lawsuits in the U.S. District Court seeking to revive the two prior lawsuits as well as initiate four others to protect the water rights of the tribes in Montana. Despite the action, the Montana Legislature enacted wide-ranging amendments to the MWUA which created a state Water Court.|$|E

The {{main goal}} of the present research work is to demonstrate how was that the swap of interest affected the financial costs of the Agroindustrial Laredo S. A.

To achieve the purpose of this investigation, an analysis of the financial situation was carried out without the swap of interest and the financial situation with the interest swap to then compare the results of both analyzes and determine the incidence of the interest swap on financial costs. In order to analyze the information, financial analysis tools were used, such as financial ratios focused basically on liquidity, indebtedness and financial expense coverage, which were applied in the Financial Statements without the application of the swap and with the application of the interest swap. When comparing the Financial Situation of both realities, the incidence of the swap of interest in liquidity, indebtedness and coverage of financial expenses was determined, observing that the liquidity levels of the company increased, {{this is due to the}} fact that with the application of the swap of interest then an exchange of flows is made, then the company pays a fixed interest and the bank pays the variable interest corresponding to the equivalent of the libor rate, arriving at the conclusion that it is beneficial for the company to apply the interest swap because it allows them to have a better projection of its financial expenses, to increase its liquidity and to have a greater credit risk coverage. In this sense, the research contributes to the development of new knowledge in the field of finance, providing useful information for companies that consider the use of financial instruments as an alternative to reduce credit risk...|$|R

6000|$|It {{would be}} far more easy to heap up {{authorities}} on this article than to excuse the prolixity and tediousness of producing any at all in proof of a point which, though too often practically denied, is in its theory almost self-evident. For Suarez, handling this very question, Utrum de ratione et substantia legis esse ut propter commune bonum feratur, does not hesitate a moment, finding no ground in reason or authority to render the affirmative in the least degree disputable: [...] "In quæstione ergo proposita" [...] (says he) [...] "nulla est <b>inter</b> authores controversia; <b>sed</b> omnium commune est axioma de substantia et ratione legis esse, ut pro communi bono feratur; ita ut propter illud præcipue tradatur"; having observed in another place, [...] "Contra omnem rectitudinem est bonum commune ad privatum ordinare, seu totum ad partem propter ipsum referre." [...] Partiality and law are contradictory terms. Neither the merits nor the ill deserts, neither the wealth and importance nor the indigence and obscurity, of the one part or of the other, can make any alteration in this fundamental truth. On any other scheme, I defy any man living to settle a correct standard which may discriminate between equitable rule and the most direct tyranny. For if we can once prevail upon ourselves to depart from the strictness and integrity of this principle in favor even of a considerable party, the argument will hold for one that is less so; and thus we shall go on, narrowing the bottom of public right, until step by step we arrive, though after no very long or very forced deduction, at what one of our poets calls the enormous faith,--the faith of the many, created for the advantage of a single person. I cannot see a glimmering of distinction to evade it; nor is it possible to allege any reason for the proscription of so large a part of the kingdom, which would not hold equally to support, under parallel circumstances, the proscription of the whole.|$|R

40|$|O trabalho tem o objetivo de analisar a média de reabsorção apical dos incisivos centrais e laterais superiores de 20 pacientes na faixa etária de 09 a 39 anos, tratados ortodonticamente, com extrações dos primeiros pré-molares. A amostra foi de 40 radiografias panorâmicas {{realizadas}} no período de 1995 a 2012, sendo 20 radiografias panorâmicas iniciais (p 1) e 20 radiografias panorâmicas finais (p 2) do tratamento ortodôntico, analisadas por três observadores treinados. Na primeira fase do estudo foi efetuada a análise intra observador, ou seja, cada observador realizou nas 20 radiografias panorâmicas iniciais (p 1) e nas 20 radiografias panorâmicas finais (p 2) três medidas dos dentes 12, 11, 21 e 22, com auxilio do paquímetro digital, da borda incisal ao ápice radicular dos respectivos dentes e calculou-se a média aritmética das três medidas de cada dente avaliado. Na segunda fase do estudo, foi elaborada a análise <b>inter</b> observadores, onde <b>se</b> registrou a média aritmética final obtida de cada dente analisado pelos três observadores, para tabulação estatística dos dados pelos testes t de Student e ANOVA, com nível de significância de 5 %.

Além disto, houve diferença estatisticamente significante entre os incisivos laterais e os incisivos centrais, os quais reabsorveram menos que os primeiros (p < 0, 05). A comparação entre os fatores dente, observador e período revelou não haver inter-relação entre os mesmos e que apenas os fatores dente e período foram estatisticamente significantes (p < 0, 05). Pode-se concluir que todos os incisivos superiores apresentaram nível de reabsorção não severo após tratamento ortodôntico, com extração dos primeiros pré-molares. ABSTRACT - The study aims {{to analyze}} the average apical resorption of the central incisors and upper lateral 20 patients aged 09 to 39 years, treated orthodontically, with extraction of first premolars. The sample consisted of 40 panoramic radiographs in the period 1995 to 2012, 20 panoramic radiographs initial (p 1) and 20 panoramic radiographs end (p 2) orthodontic treatment, analyzed by three trained observers. In {{the first phase of}} the study, analysis was conducted intra observer, in other words, each observer performed the initial 20 panoramic radiographs (p 1) and the final 20 panoramic radiographs (p 2) three measures of tooth 12, 11, 21 and 22, with the aid of digital caliper, the incisal edge to the apex of their tooth, and calculated the average of the three measurements of each tooth evaluated. In the second phase of the study, the analysis was drawn inter observers, that in which the arithmetic mean obtained end of each tooth examined by three observers, tabulating statistical data by test t of Student and ANOVA, with a significance level of 5 %. The results of the comparisons of the length of dental, before and after orthodontic treatment, revealed the average resorption of 0, 96 mm for the tooth 12, 0, 69 mm for the tooth 11, 0, 89 mm for the tooth 21 and 1, 8 mm for the tooth 22, demonstrating statistical significance with p < 0, 05. Moreover, there was a statistically significant difference between the lateral incisors and central incisors, which reabsorbed less than the first (p < 0, 05). A comparison of factors tooth, observer and period showed no interrelationship between the same and that only those factors tooth and period were statistically significant (p < 0. 05).
