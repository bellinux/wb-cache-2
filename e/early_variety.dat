25|$|Moving {{at a rapid}} pace, and {{carefully}} screening his army, Kublai Khan's forces surprised Nayan at his encampment. The camp of Nayan was protected by a wagon laager, a field fortification commonly employed by steppe nomads. The khagan's army was organised in three divisions: first the Mongols, second the Chinese, and third the Guard and Kipchaks, the latter combined under Kublai's direct command. Nayan's army was less disciplined than that of Kublai's, and it is alleged that it was momentarily panicked before the battle began by the discharge, {{by some of the}} khagan's troops, of an <b>early</b> <b>variety</b> of explosive device. According to Marco Polo, as a Christian, Nayan's standard bore the insignia of the cross. The armies faced each other with their great kettle drums beating and horns sounding. The battle began with exchanges of arrows but then developed into one of close-combat with lance, sword and iron mace. The battle was hard-fought and lasted from morning until mid-day, when Nayan's army began to break up. Nayan's soldiers started to flee the field, many were cut down, and Nayan himself was captured.|$|E
25|$|Byzantine {{diplomatic}} {{policy towards}} the steppe peoples generally consisted of {{encouraging them to}} fight among themselves. The Pechenegs provided great assistance to the Byzantines in the 9th century in exchange for regular payments. Byzantium also sought alliances with the Göktürks against common enemies: in the early 7th century, one such alliance was brokered with the Western Tűrks against the Persian Sasanians in the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628. The Byzantines called Khazaria Tourkía, and by the 9th century referred to the Khazars as 'Turks'. During the period leading up to and after the siege of Constantinople in 626, Heraclius sought help via emissaries, and eventually personally, from a Göktürk chieftain of the Western Tűrkic Qağanate, Tong Yabghu Qağan, in Tiflis, plying him with gifts {{and the promise of}} marriage to his daughter, Epiphania. Tong Yabghu responded by sending a large force to ravage the Persian empire, marking the start of the Third Perso-Turkic War. A joint Byzantine-Tűrk operation breached the Caspian gates and sacked Derbent in 627. Together they then besieged Tiflis, where the Byzantines may have deployed an <b>early</b> <b>variety</b> of traction trebuchets (ἑλέπόλεις) to breach the walls. After the campaign, Tong Yabghu is reported, perhaps with some exaggeration, to have left some 40,000 troops behind with Heraclius. Though occasionally identified with Khazars, the Göktürk identification is more probable since the Khazars only emerged from that group after the fragmentation of the former sometime after 630. Sasanian Persia never recovered from the devastating defeat wrought by this invasion.|$|E

2500|$|The {{two major}} types of valve {{mechanisms}} are rotary valves and piston valves. [...] The first piston valve instruments were developed {{just after the}} start of the 19th century. The Stölzel valve (invented by Heinrich Stölzel in 1814) was an <b>early</b> <b>variety.</b> In the mid 19th century the Vienna valve was an improved design. However many professional musicians preferred rotary valves for quicker, more reliable action, until better designs of piston valves were mass manufactured {{towards the end of the}} 19th century. Since the early decades of the 20th century, piston valves have been the most common on brass instruments except for the orchestral horn and the tuba.

60|$|Besides grapes, we {{have had}} figs, and I have now learned to be very fond of them. When they first began to appear, two months ago, they had {{scarcely}} any sweetness, and tasted very like a decaying squash: this was an <b>early</b> <b>variety,</b> with purple skins. There are many kinds of figs, the best being green-skinned, growing yellower as they ripen; and the riper they are, the more the sweetness within them intensifies, till they resemble dried figs in everything, except that they retain the fresh fruit-flavor; rich, luscious, yet not palling. We have had pears, too, some of them very tolerable; and peaches, which look magnificently, as regards size and downy blush, but, have seldom much more taste than a cucumber. A succession of fruits has followed us, ever since our arrival in Florence:--first, {{and for a long}} time, abundance of cherries; then apricots, which lasted many weeks, till we were weary of them; then plums, pears, and finally figs, peaches, and grapes. Except the figs and grapes, a New England summer and autumn would give us better fruit than any we have found in Italy.|$|E
