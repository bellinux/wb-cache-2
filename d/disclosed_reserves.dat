50|$|Tier 1 {{capital is}} the core measure of a bank's {{financial}} strength from a regulator's point of view. It is composed of core capital, which consists primarily of common stock and <b>disclosed</b> <b>reserves</b> (or retained earnings), but may also include non-redeemable non-cumulative preferred stock. The Basel Committee also observed that banks have used innovative instruments {{over the years to}} generate Tier 1 capital; these are subject to stringent conditions and are limited to a maximum of 15% of total Tier 1 capital. This part of the Tier 1 capital will be phased out during the implementation of Basel III.|$|E
5000|$|Tier 1 capital, {{the more}} {{important}} of the two, consists largely of shareholders' equity and <b>disclosed</b> <b>reserves.</b> This is the amount paid up to originally purchase the stock (or shares) of the Bank (not the amount those shares are currently trading for on the stock exchange), retained profits subtracting accumulated losses, and other qualifiable Tier 1 capital securities (see below). In simple terms, if the original stockholders contributed $100 to buy their stock and the Bank has made $10 in retained earnings each year since, paid out no dividends, had no other forms of capital and made no losses, after 10 years the Bank's tier one capital would be $200. Shareholders equity and retained earnings are now {{commonly referred to as}} [...] "Core" [...] Tier 1 capital, whereas Tier 1 is core Tier 1 together with other qualifying Tier 1 capital securities.|$|E
30|$|The first sample used in {{this paper}} comes from the bank {{statements}} (balance-sheets, profit and loss accounts) reported to the Banco de Españ a by all commercial banks and savings banks between 1995 and 2009.

This information is available with (at least) a quarterly frequency at the bank level. The bank balance sheets contain the stock of outstanding lending to firms grouped in 23 different industries and, for each industry, we also know the share of non-performing loans up to 2009 :Q 1. The information on capital requirements is only available for the whole sample at a yearly frequency and on a consolidated basis. We use Tier 1 capital, which includes capital, <b>disclosed</b> <b>reserves,</b> preference shares and nonvoting equity.|$|E
40|$|We explore {{why some}} {{firms in the}} {{extractive}} industries <b>disclose</b> mineral <b>reserve</b> quantum in their annual reports and others do not. We propose that the firms' reserve disclosure policies are {{a function of the}} extent of information asymmetries, as well as information production, litigation and proprietary costs. More specifically, we propose that a firm's decisions to <b>disclose</b> <b>reserves</b> in the annual report are a function of the stage of the firm's operations, use of project financing, and the cost of measuring reserves.

This article provides empirical evidence regarding voluntary disclosure of such reserves {{in line with the}} previously unresearched UK sector with regard to its unique reporting guidelines. The study considers both the reporting of the reserve quantum and the quality of that reporting. This article seeks to inform the International Accounting Standards Board’s (IASB’s) on-going consideration of mineral resource reporting. Listed companies are considered to evidence forms of reserve disclosure with a logistical regression approach applied to measure determinants of reporting. The risk associated with mineral reporting reserves is hypothesized as the key disclosure driver whilst controlling other relevant variables. The majority of firms <b>disclosed</b> <b>reserve</b> quantities in some form but only a minority disclosed in line with recommended practice, disclosure quality being more variable between companies. The findings indicate that a voluntary disclosure approach is ineffective, partially explained by agency related behaviour. Risk, proxied by the stage of production, drives reserve disclosure showing that producer firms are more likely to <b>disclose</b> <b>reserve</b> quantum balances and of a significantly higher quality...|$|R

40|$|Shill bidding in English auctions {{is the use}} of insincere bids on the seller’s behalf to artificially {{drive up}} the price of the listing. Shilling is illegal and has become a serious problem in online auctions because it is easy for the seller to bid under false names and hence self-collude. We show that in an {{independent}} private-value (IPV) English auction where there are heterogeneous bidders the seller can increase her expected profit by starting with a low ex ante reserve price and then optionally resetting it via shilling after observing the second highest bidder’s valuation. A shill-proof mechanism needs to ensure that the seller’s optimal strategy is to set her optimal reserve based upon her best estimation of the possible presence of a high-type bidder ex ante and not to revise the reserve via shilling. We introduce a Shill-Proof Fee (SPF) schedule for IPV English auctions where an auctioneer charges the seller a commission fee not based upon the final sale price but the difference between the final sale price and the seller’s <b>disclosed</b> <b>reserve.</b> Commission rates vary across auctions, and are mathematically determined to guarantee the non-profitability of shilling...|$|R
40|$|Oil and gas {{reserves}} {{are the most}} important assets of oil and gas companies. A source of confusion for investors in oil companies is that reserves quantities and values are uncertain estimates. Reserves are typically classified according to probabilities of recovery from underground reservoirs. All U. S. listed companies have to <b>disclose</b> proved <b>reserves</b> but not probable reserves, thus leaving out potentially important information for investors and financial analysts. This study addresses the impact on market valuation of various classifications of reserves amounts. Using a data sample of 94 companies that do disclose information on probable reserves, we compare the relation between three classifications of reserves and oil company returns. While we find that information on probable reserves do not have an impact on stock returns measured over the entire time period, {{this is not the case}} since 2009, coinciding with the onset of the shale gas revolution...|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluate}} whether, {{and under}} what circumstances, corporate tax aggressiveness influences audit pricing. Using a compound measure of two long-run effective tax rates, we find that tax-aggressive firms pay higher fees for external audit services after controlling for factors related to earnings management. The fee premium increases with management’s uncertainty about the sustainability of tax positions if audited by tax authorities (i. e., <b>disclosed</b> tax <b>reserves).</b> Further, the provision of auditor-provided tax services may create knowledge spillovers that alleviate the fee premium for tax aggressiveness, unless tax uncertainty is high. Finally, an accounting firm’s industry expertise in auditing is associated with higher audit fees independent of tax aggressiveness, whereas industry expertise in taxation leads to a fee premium only for tax-aggressive clients. Overall, the evidence implies firms’ aggressive tax behavior, tax services provider, and auditor expertise interact to influence the pricing of audit engagements. status: publishe...|$|R

We also show that the impact of the unexpected component of inflation announcements is also dependent upon the "signals" that the Federal Reserve sends to the market (the known Federal Reserve Bias). In fact, we found a negative correlation between the unexpected component of macroeconomic announcements and stock price returns, this correlation being statistically significant when the Federal <b>Reserve</b> <b>discloses</b> a Neutral Bias...|$|R
40|$|Managers {{of oil and}} gas {{and mining}} firms face a {{trade-off}} when <b>disclosing</b> quantum of <b>reserves</b> in the annual reports. The disclosure is likely to reduce the firm's cost of equity and debt. On the other hand, information about the firm’s reserves is likely to attract competitors' attention. Therefore, managers aim to achieve an optimum level of disclosure in the firms' annual reports. This study examines the impact of a change in Australian Stock Exchange listing rules regarding disclosure of reserves. The change in the rules {{does not seem to have}} much effect on the frequency of disclosure. Instead, the disclosure is influenced by firm's size, auditor quality, stage of growth, project financing, and reserves' measurement costs. Earlier studies focused on disclosure of reserves by firms in the oil and gas industry. This study extends the previous work by focusing on oil and gas firms as well as mining firms...|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} {{the decade}} renewed hopes were {{beginning}} to shine on the camp. Enough exploration work had been conducted while Bell's encouraging reports were finally giving the camp some positive results. In 1918, new ore <b>reserves</b> were <b>disclosed</b> at the Keely mine, however it would take four more years before the Keeley became fully operational. A second property began to show promise in 1920 as well. The Haileybury Silver property (Frontier) had received some attention and soon the need for Cobalt would prompt this property back under the microscope. In 1921 extensive drilling and intense underground drifting <b>disclosed</b> ample cobalt <b>reserve</b> and eventually a large silver ore shoot indicating over 200000 oz of silver was discovered. The junior company quickly sold the property to the Mining Corporation of Canada, a major silver producer based in Cobalt, for $525,000. By the end of 1922 the Frontier Mine is the second mine fully operational and like the Keeley had begun to ship highgrade ore. The T&NO Railway found the prospects at Silver so enticing that it announced the construction of a branchline to the which was finally completed in 1924. The Keeley and Frontier add stamp and floatation mills to recuperate the rich mill grade ores associated with the native silver.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} selling mechanisms relevant {{mainly to}} auctions and applicable {{in the context}} of the housing market. In the first two chapters a context is described in which the seller of an object has private information about its value that is important to potential buyers. If the seller is unable to reveal this information to the buyers at no cost, the problem of adverse selection arises. Among other examples, auctions of arts, wines, and residential properties are most relevant to the current study. The sellers in these markets observe some private characteristics of their objects that are important to buyers but not revealable to them at no cost. In the first chapter we study some common selling mechanisms in this setting. Specifically, we study an ascending auction with two different reserve price regimes for the seller: first, <b>disclosing</b> the <b>reserve</b> price at the beginning of the auction; and second, keeping the reserve price secret and reserving the right to accept or reject the auction price after the bidding ends. We also study the common posted-price mechanism for the purposes of comparison. Throughout this chapter the assumption is that the seller chooses the mechanism from the ex ante point of view-that is, before observing her signal. Thus, the choice of mechanism itself does not reveal any further information to the buyers. The results in the first chapter suggest that in a one-shot game the seller can realise a higher ex ante expected payoff by choosing the secret reserve price regime than the other two mechanisms. At the end this chapter a dynamic setting is studied to examine the possibility of an extension of these static results to a dynamic case. Most of the results for the one-shot game are extendable to the proposed dynamic game. In the second chapter we study an informed seller's best interest among the two previously mentioned reserve price regimes at the interim stage-that is, after the seller has observed her private information. We study how the seller's expected payoff could change if she observes the signal and then chooses the reserve price mechanism. In this case the choice of mechanism itself could reveal some information to buyers. The results show the conditions under which an informed seller, after observing her signal, chooses to keep the reserve price secret or <b>discloses</b> the <b>reserve</b> price. The last two chapters focus specifically on the housing market. The third chapter adds to the theoretical literature of the housing market by proposing a more realistic selling mechanism applicable to this market: the one in which the seller posts a price to attract potential buyers to make a counteroffer. This game is studied in a dynamic setting with the possibility of more than one potential buyer arriving at each period. In the event that one buyer arrives, the seller engages in negotiation with that buyer; in the event that multiple buyers arrive, the seller runs an auction with a reserve price. This explains why sometimes sale prices are higher than the asking price and at the same time proposes a role for the asking price in this market. Other small variations of this mechanism are also studied for the purposes of comparison. The final chapter is an empirical study of the Sydney housing market. We use comprehensive data on the Sydney housing market composed of 25, 489 observations for properties sold in the Sydney region in 2011. We consider the fact that both the seller of the property and the real estate agent have a common goal: to sell the property at the highest possible price in the shortest amount of time. The analysis is divided into two major parts. First, we estimate a two-stage least square model to analyse which parameters affect time on the market for a property. Second, we propose a probit model that estimates the parameters that affect a revision in list prices. The results suggest that overpricing increases time spent on the market, and properties with a revised list price stay on the market for a longer time...|$|R
40|$|Earnings {{management}} {{refers to}} management's intentional discretion on managing accounting information or real life decisions as a purpose to mislead company's stakeholders. Earnings can be misstated due to managers' own incentives {{or with the}} objective of maximizing the wealth of a company. Earnings management literature aims to explain why managers manipulate earnings, how they do so and what the consequences of this behavior are. This thesis studies these key questions and aims at finding answers to them in regard to the mining industry. Mining is truly global with operations spread amongst a wide range of global locations. Shares of mining companies dominate in many stock exchange and as such {{are an integral part of}} the financial system. In turn, mining companies have an urge for funds: exploration activities for finding economically viable and technically feasible mineral resources take years, require substantial capital and must bear economic downturns. Accounting for mining activities presents many challenges. Significant upfront investments, uncertainty over prospects or mineral resources and long project lives create difficulties and requires discretion and judgment by the company's management. The most significant source of value for mining entities are mineral reserves and resources - together with the mining company's ability to transform mineral resources into cash flows. A variety of accounting approaches and policies is developed by mining companies. However, there is an increasing trend in adopting IFRSs in the industry. A single set of high quality, globally understandable accounting standards helps mining companies in communicating on a transparent and globally consistent way and meeting their need for capital. Regardless of the fact that mining companies compile financial statements according to IFRSs, they possess various positions for management to pursue discretion in preparing financial statements. There are no disclosure requirements for mineral resources under IFRS and it is not mandatory to provide disclosures in all jurisdictions. Some entities still choose to <b>disclose</b> their <b>reserves</b> and resources on a voluntary basis. This thesis has provided further understanding in earnings management in the mining industry, especially regarding incentives to engage with earnings management activities and the tools that management may use for managing earnings. The main motivation for managing earnings in the mining industry lies in capital market reasons due to the high capital-dependency of the industry. The study has further confirmed the need for IFRS guidance among extractive industries and the fact that the reporting of mineral resources should be linked to financial reporting standards. The connection between IFRSs and a reporting code for mineral resources would finally uniform the true value of a mining company and financial reporting quality, and therefore is promoted from the perspective of this study...|$|R
6000|$|On {{this third}} visit Deronda found Hans Meyrick {{installed}} with his easel at Diplow, beginning his {{picture of the}} three daughters sitting on a bank, [...] "in the Gainsborough style," [...] and varying his work by rambling to Pennicote to sketch the village children and improve his acquaintance with the Gascoignes. Hans appeared to have recovered his vivacity, but Deronda detected some feigning in it, as we detect the artificiality of a lady's bloom from its being a little too high-toned and steadily persistent (a [...] "Fluctuating Rouge" [...] not having yet appeared among the advertisements). Also with all his grateful friendship and admiration for Deronda, Hans could not help a certain irritation against him, such as extremely incautious, open natures are apt to feel when the breaking of a friend's <b>reserve</b> <b>discloses</b> a state of things not merely unsuspected but the reverse {{of what had been}} hoped and ingeniously conjectured. It is true that poor Hans had always cared chiefly to confide in Deronda, and had been quite incurious as to any confidence that might have been given in return; but what outpourer of his own affairs is not tempted to think any hint of his friend's affairs is an egotistic irrelevance? That was no reason why it was not rather a sore reflection to Hans that while he had been all along naively opening his heart about Mirah, Deronda had kept secret a feeling of rivalry which now revealed itself as the important determining fact. Moreover, it is always at their peril that our friends turn out to be something more than we were aware of. Hans must be excused for these promptings of bruised sensibility, since he had not allowed them to govern his substantial conduct: he had the consciousness of having done right by his fortunate friend; or, as he told himself, [...] "his metal had given a better ring than he would have sworn to beforehand." [...] For Hans had always said that in point of virtue he was a dilettante: which meant that he was very fond of it in other people, but if he meddled with it himself he cut a poor figure. Perhaps in reward of his good behavior he gave his tongue the more freedom; and he was too fully possessed by the notion of Deronda's happiness to have a conception of what he was feeling about Gwendolen, so that he spoke of her without hesitation.|$|R
