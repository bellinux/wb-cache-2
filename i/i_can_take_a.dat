6000|$|... "Well, I've {{learned a}} whole lot to-day," [...] said Snap as they walked along. [...] "I am sure <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> much better picture than formerly." ...|$|E
60|$|KNOX. And the {{pavement}} is hard. I flatter myself <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> hint. I wonder where the devil my pin is. I {{left it on}} the table.|$|E
6000|$|... "Or <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> fly," [...] said Eleanor. [...] "You know I am not {{embarrassed by}} so many {{difficulties}} as you young ladies; I can go alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will come}} again?" [...] he said softly. [...] "I {{want to explain}} a little further what Naudheim was saying. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> you <b>a</b> little further, even, than he did to-day." ...|$|R
60|$|Will {{you come}} with me, Hilda? <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> you to <b>a</b> land where the whole earth speaks only of love--and where only love and youth and beauty matter.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's {{no reason}} why you should do that," [...] he replied. [...] "I can't leave the canoe here, anyway, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> you in <b>a</b> little lower down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am called Strong-Back; I {{come from}} Power-borough, and I possess such {{strength}} that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> mountain on my back, {{and it seems}} a feather to me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You're very good, Sir,' {{returned}} Brass, 'I am sure. Is {{there any}} other order, sir, that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> note of, besides this little matter of Mr Richard?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Paul," [...] he said, [...] "I congratulate you, my boy! I was on {{the other}} side; but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> licking with the best of them. Congratulate you heartily!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Be {{particular}} about the rifles. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> you to <b>a</b> little corner in Canada where the bears don't stand on ceremony. Put everything in hand, {{and be ready}} to come down to Cornwall with me on Monday." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>Can</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> {{carriage}} {{after the}} lecture {{and go out}} and stay with you that night, provided you find at that distant time that it will not inconvenience you? Is Aldrich home yet? ...|$|R
6000|$|Evelyn smiled. [...] "Well, <b>I</b> {{suppose you}} <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> bold line. If one has pluck, it {{sometimes}} pays. At all events, it's flattering to feel {{one can be}} oneself. No doubt, you all develop your individuality in Canada." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Cards are {{not much}} in my line," [...] Mr. Jarvis admitted, [...] "not having, as a rule, the time to spare, but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> hand at loo, if desired." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not by any means. But it's getting itself complicated, Mr. Green. I mean {{to see the}} end of it, and if I'm beat,--why <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> beating as well {{as another}} man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm told," [...] said he, [...] "that New York is a plumb dead town; but I'll go. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> whirl in San Antone for a {{few days}} on my way and have some fun." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thank you}} all deeply," [...] said the Knight earnestly, [...] "but think it not ill of me if I cannot take it. Gladly have I {{borrowed}} it from you, {{but it may not}} be that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> it as <b>a</b> gift." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He asks {{me in his}} letter," [...] Mrs. Conway {{said with}} a passing smile of amusement, [...] "if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> in <b>a</b> young friend of his, Miss Mabel Withers. He says {{she has never been}} from home before, {{and that it would be}} a treat for her to get away and see a little of the world. He is going to stop a few days in London, and show her the sights on his way back." ...|$|R
60|$|BRASSBOUND. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> you to Meskala, {{from which}} you can see the Atlas Mountains. From Meskala <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> you to <b>an</b> ancient castle in the hills, where you can put up as long as you please. The {{customary}} charge is half a dollar a man per day and his food. I charge double.|$|R
60|$|MICH. I think not. I {{will wear}} {{the uniform of}} the Imperial Guard, and the Colonel on duty is one of us. It is on the first floor, you remember; so <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> long shot.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I didn’t," [...] ses Sam, [...] "and don’t {{you forget}} it. This ain’t the fust time you’ve told that lie about me. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> joke with any man; but anybody that goes and ses I tickled—" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 52. Fairly clear, but {{brightness}} not {{comparable to}} that of the actual scene. The objects are sharply defined; some of them are salient, and others insignificant and dim, but by separate efforts <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> visualised inventory of the whole table.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was saying," [...] he went on, without {{answering}} her question, [...] "that George may {{sell the}} land or settle it, but must not {{leave it to}} me or you, nor <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> under <b>an</b> intestacy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{are lots}} of stumps of trees here, Bertie, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> half <b>a</b> turn round {{one of them and}} so let you down easily; then when you shout I will fasten the rope there and come to the edge, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> hear whether you want me to haul or not. Of course it must depend whether there are any jagged rocks {{sticking}} out. If so, {{it would be better for}} you to climb, as the rope might chafe against them if I pulled." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] {{replied the}} Scarecrow, {{brightening}} at the suggestion. [...] "The Tin Woodman {{will do anything}} we ask him, for he's one of my dearest friends. <b>I</b> believe we <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> crosscut into his country and so get to his castle a day sooner than if we travel back the way we came." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wouldn't. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> licking. Why, Worry, {{you talk}} as if--as if I'd done {{something}} terrible. What's {{the matter with}} me? I've done every single thing you wanted--just as well as I could do it. What are you afraid of?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, Mrs. Ferrari, {{unless you}} have some more {{extraordinary}} news for me, I think I shall wish you good-morning too. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> note of your information (very startling information, I own); and, {{in the absence of}} proof, I can do no more.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can bear}} that;--though {{it is hard}} the having to go away and live among strange people. I think I shall get a farm somewhere, and see if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> lesson from you. I don't know {{anything}} else that I can do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He was at {{the hotel}}; and to the hotel I {{instantly}} proposed that we should go. It is a busy, crowded place; and (with my veil down) I have less fear of compromising myself there than at my quiet lodgings. Besides, it is vitally {{important to me to}} know what Armadale does next, under this total change of circumstances--for I must so control his proceedings as to get him away from England if <b>I</b> <b>can.</b> We <b>took</b> <b>a</b> cab: such was my eagerness to sympathize with the heart-broken lover, that we <b>took</b> <b>a</b> cab! ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Oh, I don’t know,” replied Dave. “I am dead {{tired and}} so are you, and I don’t think anybody will come to harm us,—and there are no large wild beasts on the island. <b>I</b> guess we <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> chance,” {{and as soon as}} their {{clothing}} was dry, both turned in, on beds of vines and moss.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; I am {{anxious to}} go abroad, {{for the sake}} of my wife's health, and I am not {{particular}} as to what I do, so that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> her to <b>a</b> warm climate. I may say that I have been two years in Egypt, and speak Arabic and Koptic fluently. I am strong and active, and am ready to make myself useful, in any way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{sometimes}} feel that I'm making none. She {{looks at me}} half amused and half astonished when I express my opinions; I have to keep a curb on myself when I talk to her. In fact, I've once or twice got mad. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> joke, but her condescending smile is riling." ...|$|E
60|$|She gave {{a sort of}} hiccup and, darting forward, {{kissed me}} on the forehead. Unpleasant, of course, but, as Anatole would say, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> few smooths with a rough. The next moment she was legging it for the dining-room, while I, having bunged the bicycle into a bush, made for the stairs.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mrs. Gray, [...] "I think I {{should like}} to go up {{at least as far}} as there. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> book to read, to while away the time while you are up the mountain; or I can ramble about, I suppose. Is it a {{pleasant}} place to ramble about, around the Hermitage?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can't you get {{it across}} without a cab?" [...] said Mr. George. [...] "I don't see how <b>I</b> <b>can</b> afford to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> cab, very well; for you see we have to incur an extra expense as it is, {{to go in the}} cars at all, since we have already paid our passage up by the steamer." ...|$|R
2500|$|Rose's much awaited return came on October 5, 2013, in a {{pre-season}} {{game against}} the Indiana Pacers. He had a slow start but scored his first point in the first quarter. He finished the game with 13 points in 20 minutes of play. On October 16, 2013, Rose returned to play in Chicago for the first time, scoring 22 points against the Detroit Pistons. [...] "I think I'm way more explosive now. Like getting to the rim. <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> contact <b>a</b> little bit better. And as far as jumping-wise, <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>can</b> jump even higher. They tested my vertical -- I increased it by 5 inches", Rose said after the win. During the pre-season, Rose averaged 20.7 points and 5 assists.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} this part?" [...] asked young Curly as they emerged into the street. [...] "It 's really jolly; one of the darkest bits in London--it is really. If you care, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> you through <b>an</b> awfully {{dangerous}} place where the police never go." [...] He seemed so anxious for the honour that Shelton was loath to disappoint him. [...] "I come here pretty often," [...] he went on, as they ascended a sort of alley rambling darkly between a wall and row of houses.|$|R
