50|$|The {{crew of the}} World War I-design {{submarine}} then {{prepared for}} service in the Aleutian Islands. Radiant-type heaters were purchased in San Diego, California, to augment the heat provided by the <b>galley</b> <b>range.</b> Heavier and more waterproof clothing, including ski masks, {{were added to the}} regular issue provided to submarine crews. The boat itself was fitted out for wartime service and, in January 1942, S-23 moved north to Dutch Harbor, Unalaska.|$|E
50|$|Rain squalls {{associated}} with the typhoon arrived at Port San Vicente at about 0600 hours on 15 August 1936, and Fathomer began sending frequent weather reports to Manila. The weather deteriorated throughout the day, and winds reached 90 miles per hour (145 kilometers per hour) by 1730 hours; by 1905 hours winds were estimated to have reached 120 to 150 miles (193 to 242 kilometers) per hour and were creating waves six feet (1.8 meters) high even in the virtually landlocked inner harbor, so Fathomer began to operate her engines first at half-speed ahead and then at full speed ahead {{to try to keep}} from drifting. However, one of her anchor cables parted, and the wind and seas forced her aground on a reef at about 1925 hours, after which the wind forced her to list heavily to starboard. The typhoons eye passed over Fathomer from 2015 to 2035 hours, allowing her crew to make some repairs and send a distress signal to Manila, but the extremely high winds had returned by 2040 hours. The wind forced the ships bow around to the southwest. She listed to starboard so far that her boat deck rail was underwater. The <b>galley</b> <b>range</b> and rice boiler broke loose and tore off a ventilator to the forecastle, causing the forecastle to flood, and the engine room and boiler room also became flooded when the engine room houses starboard side became submerged. The ships generator failed at 2100 hours, leaving her in darkness, and the radio house had to be abandoned when it threatened to tear loose from the ship. The crew took shelter along the port alleyway, well above the waters surface, but waves increased in height significantly and broke over the men despite their height above the water.|$|E
60|$|Freda {{then went}} about her occupations, and Edmund, knowing that Siegbert {{would not return}} for some time, as he was going with Bijorn to a council {{which was to be}} held early in the day, strolled down to look at the <b>galleys</b> <b>ranged</b> along on the beach. These varied greatly in form and character. Some of the sailing ships were large and clumsy, but the galleys for rowing were lightly and {{gracefully}} built. They were low in the water, rising to a lofty bow, which sometimes turned over like the neck of a swan, at other times terminated in a sharp iron prow, formed for running down a hostile boat. Some of them were of great length, with seats for twenty rowers on either side, while all were provided with sails as well as oars. When the hour for dinner approached he returned to Siegbert's tent. The jarl had not yet come back from the council. When he did so Edmund perceived at once that he was flushed and angry.|$|R
60|$|As {{soon as the}} English were seen, the {{merchant}} ships were ordered up the channel to Puerto Real, and the men {{of war and the}} fleet of seventeen war <b>galleys</b> were <b>ranged</b> under the guns of Fort Puntales to prevent the English passing up. It had first been decided to attempt a landing in the harbour of Galeta, {{on the south side of}} the city; but a heavy sea was setting in, and although the troops had been got into the boats they were re-embarked, and the fleet sailed round and anchored at the mouth of the channel leading up the bay. A council of war was held that night, and it was decided that the fleet should move up the bay with the tide next morning, and attack the Spanish fleet.|$|R
