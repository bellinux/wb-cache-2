40|$|Background {{and purpose}} : Basal cell {{carcinoma}} {{is the most}} common malignancy of the eyelids and is frequently misdiagnosed. Materials and methods : The diagnostic accuracy and index <b>of</b> <b>suspicion</b> <b>of</b> basal cell carcinoma of the periorbital region for ophthalmologist were calculated by Lightstones method. Data were analyzed retrospectively from the pathology records at the Kerman Medical Sciences University. Results : The diagnostic accuracy and Index <b>of</b> <b>suspicion</b> were 72. 7 % and 87. 8 %. Conclusion : Diagnostic accuracy for ophthalmologist was comparable with other studies but the Index <b>of</b> <b>suspicion</b> was lower than other studies and must be improred...|$|R

40|$|Drug-use {{surveillance}} systems {{appear in}} this paper as symptomatic “technologies <b>of</b> <b>suspicion</b> ” that constitute a set of empirical modes for producing and interpreting “data ” or test results in ways that conflate prediction with prescription, acting as technological forms of supervision, monitoring, supposed deterrence, and ultimately control. Technologies <b>of</b> <b>suspicion</b> are predicated upon a framework of trust; they are deployed within a “system of takings-for-granted ” that presupposes trust and thus makes distrust possible. Drug-testing provides {{an excellent example of}} the institutionalization of distrust through the deployment <b>of</b> technologies <b>of</b> <b>suspicion</b> not only within institutions but beyond their real and virtual walls. The paper considers the also considers the decentralization and deinstitutionalization of distrust, the capillary dispersion <b>of</b> <b>suspicion</b> throughout the carceral society, and the role of distrust in underwriting the development of certain kinds of knowledge systems and technologies, forms of social and cognitive order, and the functional dispersion of police practices to individuals such as parents, teachers, and peers.

40|$|Regulation of Terry stops of {{pedestrians}} {{by police}} requires {{articulation of the}} reasonable and individualized bases <b>of</b> <b>suspicion</b> that motivate their actions. Nearly five decades after Terry, courts have {{found it difficult to}} articulate the boundaries or parameters <b>of</b> reasonable <b>suspicion.</b> The behavior and appearances of individuals combine with the social and spatial contexts where police observe them to create an algebra <b>of</b> <b>suspicion.</b> Police can proceed to approach and temporarily detain a person at a threshold <b>of</b> <b>suspicion</b> that Courts have been unable and perhaps unwilling to articulate. The result has been sharp tensions within Fourth Amendment doctrine as to what is reasonable, why, and in what circumstances. The jurisprudence <b>of</b> <b>suspicion</b> is no clearer today {{than it was in the}} aftermath of Terry. This issue has taken center stage in both litigation and policy debates on the legality of the Stop and Frisk policing regime in New York. Under this regime, police record the bases <b>of</b> <b>suspicion</b> using both a menu of codified stop rationales with supplemental text narratives to record their descriptions of suspicious behaviors or circumstances that produced actionable suspicion. Evidence from 4. 4 million stops provide an empirical basis to assess the revealed preferences of police officers as to the bases for these Terry stops and identify narratives <b>of</b> <b>suspicion</b> that justify their actions beyond the idiosyncrasies of the individual case. First, we identify patterns <b>of</b> articulated <b>suspicion.</b> Next, we show the individual factors and social conditions that shape how those patterns are applied. We also show how patterns evolve over time and become clearer and more refined across a wide range of police stops. That refinement seems to follow the capacious interpretative room created by Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. Next, we assess the extent of constitutional compliance and examine the neighborhood and individual factors that predict noncompliance. The results suggest that the observed patterns of narratives have evolved into shared narratives or scripts <b>of</b> <b>suspicion,</b> and that these patterns are specific to suspect race and neighborhood factors. We conclude that scripts are expressions of the norms within the everyday organizational exercise of police discretion and that these scripts defeat the requirement of individualization inherent in caselaw governing Fourth Amendment stops...|$|R
