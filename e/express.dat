5|$|Bergen Street was {{originally}} designed as an <b>express</b> station, {{but only the}} upper level is currently in service; the lower level is neither in regular service nor usable due to its deteriorated condition. The lower level of the station was used when <b>express</b> service was provided on the Culver Line between 1968 and 1976. <b>Express</b> service was eliminated due {{to the loss of}} direct local service along the line to Manhattan. The <b>express</b> platforms were permanently removed from service during the 1990s, and due to a fire in 1999 the relay room was damaged, making the <b>express</b> tracks unusable. The relay room was rebuilt in 2008, and after repairs were done on the line, the implementation of <b>express</b> service become feasible. In 2016, it was announced that the MTA was considering having <b>express</b> service brought back to the line. However, unlike the earlier <b>express</b> service, <b>express</b> trains will skip this station due to the high cost of rebuilding it, thus making the station a local stop.|$|E
5|$|For {{lines with}} three or four tracks with <b>express</b> service, local stops will have side {{platforms}} and the middle one or two tracks will not stop at the station. On these lines, <b>express</b> stations typically have two island platforms, one for the local and <b>express</b> in one direction, and another for the local and <b>express</b> in the other direction. Each island platform provides a cross-platform interchange between local and <b>express</b> services. Some lines with four-track <b>express</b> service have two tracks each on two levels and use both island and side platforms.|$|E

F trains were {{extended}} once again via the Culver Line. From June 1968 to 1987, the Culver Line featured <b>express</b> service during rush hours. F trains ran <b>express</b> {{in both directions}} between Bergen Street and Church Avenue, while G trains were extended from Smithâ€“Ninth Streets to Church Avenue to provide local service. <b>Express</b> service on the elevated portion of the line to Kings Highway operated in the peak direction (to Manhattan AM; to Brooklyn PM), with some F trains running local and some running <b>express.</b> <b>Express</b> service between Bergen and Church ended in 1976, and between Church and Kings Highway in 1987, largely due to budget constraints and complaints from passengers at local stations. <b>Express</b> service on the elevated Culver Line was ended due to necessary structural work, but never restored. With the end of <b>express</b> service, Bergen Street's lower level {{was taken out of}} service. Following renovations to the station in the 1990s, the lower level was converted into storage space and is not usable for passenger service in its current state.|$|E

25|$|Some {{of these}} mutant {{channels}} have been <b>expressed</b> in {{dorsal root ganglion}} (DRG) or sympathetic neurons. In DRG neurons <b>expressing</b> the F1449V mutation, a lower threshold is required for action potential creation (93.1 Â± 12.0 pA) than those <b>expressing</b> wild-type channels (124.1 Â± 7.4 pA). Furthermore, while DRG neurons <b>expressing</b> wild-type channels only respond with a few action potentials, those <b>expressing</b> F1449V channels respond with a high-frequency train of action potentials. There is a similar effect in DRG neurons <b>expressing</b> the L858H and A863P mutants. Here, {{there is also a}} notable change in resting membrane potential, being depolarized by 4-7 mV versus wild-type channel <b>expressing</b> cells. The situation is different, however, in sympathetic neurons <b>expressing</b> the L858H mutation. While L858H <b>expressing</b> sympathetic ganglion are depolarized ~5mV relative to wild-type <b>expressing</b> neurons, their threshold for action potential initiation is notably higher. Furthermore, while current injection of 40pA for 950ms provokes an average of 6 action potentials in sympathetic neurons <b>expressing</b> wild-type channels this stimulation evokes only approximately 2 action potentials with reduced overshoots in sympathetic neurons <b>expressing</b> L858H mutant channels. Further investigation has demonstrated that the differences in response between DRG and sympathetic neurons is due to expression of NaV1.8 in the former. Consequently, expression of NaV1.8 channels in sympathetic neurons also <b>expressing</b> L858H mutant NaV1.7 results in neurons with a depolarized resting membrane potential that nevertheless have a normal action potential threshold and overshoot.|$|R
