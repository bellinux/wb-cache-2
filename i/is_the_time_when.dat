5|$|Afternoon is {{the time}} of the day between noon and evening. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> the sun is {{descending}} from its zenith in the sky to somewhat before its terminus at the horizon in the west direction. In human life, it occupies roughly {{the latter half of the}} standard work and school day. It is also associated with a number of concerns related to health, safety, and economic productivity: generally, the early afternoon, after most people have eaten lunch, corresponds to decreased work performance, decreased alertness, and a higher incidence of motor vehicle accidents. It is usually from 12 PM to 6 PM, but during winter it may be from 12 PM to 4 PM and during summer it may be from 12 PM to 8 PM.|$|E
5|$|The table {{contains}} {{the date and}} time of the greatest eclipse (in dynamical time, {{which in this case}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> the axis of the Moon's shadow cone passes closest to the centre of Earth; this is in Universal Time). The number of the saros series that the eclipse belongs to is given, followed by the magnitude of the eclipse (the fraction of the Sun's diameter obscured by the Moon) and the type of the eclipse (either total, annular, partial or hybrid). For total and annular eclipses, the duration of the eclipse is given, as well as the location of the greatest eclipse (the point of maximum eclipse) and the path width of the total or annular eclipse. The geographical areas from which the eclipse can be seen are listed.|$|E
5|$|Candidates {{may use the}} Internet {{to publish}} {{election}} advertising, including posting content on electronic media applications (such as digital banners, instant messaging software, mobile applications, RSS feed readers and widgets), social networking services and other websites, and sending e-mails. SMS and MMS messages can also be sent. Candidates must notify the returning officer of each platform on the Internet {{that is used to}} publish election advertising within 12 hours after the start of the campaign period (that <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> the place of nomination closes on nomination day) and thereafter each time before a platform is used for such publication. Candidate and their election agents must use their best efforts to ensure that all Internet election advertising is published in accordance with the law; in other words, the returning officer must be satisfied that all reasonable steps in the circumstances were taken. Contravening any regulations relating to election advertising on the Internet is a criminal offence punishable by a fine of up to $1,000, jail of up to 12 months, or both.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>time</b> {{interval}} between acute and convalescent phase serologies was usually 6 – 8  weeks, as this <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> follow-up appointments <b>were</b> usually scheduled.|$|R

50|$|Communal meals <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> all monks of an {{institution}} are together. Diet and eating habits differ somewhat by monastic order, and more widely by schedule. <b>The</b> Benedictine rule <b>is</b> illustrative.|$|R
5|$|The Mikea {{live in a}} {{symbiotic}} relationship with the neighboring Masikoro farmers and herders, and the Vezo fishing clan. The Mikea live primarily on food scavenged from the forest but also grow seasonal crops. Their mobility and reliance on scavenging as opposed to crop growing shifts in response to changes in environmental and economic pressures on availability of resources within the Mikea {{community as well as}} those of their Vezo and Masikoro neighbors. The Mikea sell their forest products, as well as woven mats and food animals they raise, at weekly Vezo and Masikoro markets in nearby villages to obtain the necessities they cannot scavenge, such as clothing and medicine. Some Mikea migrate for periods of time to work in local villages or the town of Morombe. They are also hired to work for Vezo and Masikoro villagers, such as by cutting forest for villagers or other Mikeas' corn fields, or guarding villagers' zebu herds. They occasionally acquire one or more zebu in addition to or in lieu of payment, as these are seen as a form of wealth and are mainly sacrificed in ancestral ceremonies rather than eaten as food. The rainy season <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> Mikea are most likely to leave their scavenging encampments for wage labor opportunities in villages or for the corn harvest. This is also the time when Masikoro and Vezo villagers are most likely to move into the forest to grow corn.|$|E
5|$|The ascent is an {{important}} part of the process of decompression, as this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> reduction of ambient pressure occurs, and it is of critical importance to safe decompression that the ascent rate is compatible with safe elimination of inert gas from the diver's tissues. Ascent rate must be limited to prevent supersaturation of tissues to the extent that unacceptable bubble development occurs. This is usually done by specifying a maximum ascent rate compatible with the decompression model chosen. This will be specified in the decompression tables or the user manual for the decompression software or personal decompression computer. The instructions will usually include contingency procedures for deviation from the specified rate, both for delays and exceeding the recommended rate. Failure to comply with these specifications will generally increase the risk of decompression sickness.|$|E

25|$|The salmon run <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> salmon, {{which have}} {{migrated}} from the ocean, swim {{to the upper}} reaches of rivers where they spawn on gravel beds. After spawning, all Pacific salmon and most Atlantic salmon die, and the salmon life cycle starts over again. The annual run can be a major event for grizzly bears, bald eagles and sport fishermen. Most salmon species migrate during the fall (September through November).|$|E

25|$|In north western India, {{in cities}} such as Benares, it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> Akharas (venues of wrestling {{practice}} and competitions) as part of Naga Panchami celebrations are bedecked; on this occasion the ahkaras are cleaned up thoroughly and walls painted with images of snakes, priests preside, and the gurus are honoured along with the sponsors. Its significance is that the wrestlers stand for virility and Naga symbolizes this “scheme of virility”. Akharas are decorated with snake images showing snakes drinking milk.|$|E
25|$|The virus circulates between ticks and rodents, {{with humans}} being the {{secondary}} hosts. People {{at risk for}} catching the disease are hikers and campers {{that are in the}} risk areas. Also, April, May, and June are when the infections mainly occur, because this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> the adult ticks are prevalent in the environment. Unfortunately, this is also when the weather is pleasant for hiking and camping. The best way to avoid getting bitten and catching this disease is wearing long sleeves or pants, avoiding high tick-infested areas, and wearing tick repellent.|$|E
500|$|During the Guadalajara International Book Fair in Mexico {{in early}} December 2016, Martin offered the {{following}} hint {{as to the}} tone of this book:There {{are a lot of}} dark chapters right now ... I've been telling you for 20 years that winter was coming. Winter <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> things die, and cold and ice and darkness fill the world, so {{this is not going to}} be the happy feel-good that people may be hoping for. Some of the characters [...] in very dark places.|$|E

500|$|Despite the storm's severity, it {{was neither}} the costliest nor the strongest {{to affect the}} northeastern United States. It was {{weakening}} as it made its closest approach to land, and the highest tides occurred during the neap tide, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> tide ranges are minimal. The worst of the storm effects stayed offshore. A buoy [...] northeast of Nantucket, which was [...] west of Andrea Gail last known position, recorded a [...] rise in wave height in 10 hours while the extratropical storm was still rapidly intensifying. Two buoys near the Massachusetts coast observed record wave heights, and one observed a record wind report. The United States Coast Guard rescued 25 people at sea {{at the height of}} the storm, including 13 people from Long Island Sound. A New York Air National Guard helicopter of the 106th Air Rescue Wing ditched during the storm, [...] south of Montauk, New York, after it was unable to refuel in flight and ran out of fuel. After the helicopter had attempted a rescue in the midst of the storm, an 84-person crew on the Coast Guard Cutter Tamaroa arrived and rescued four members of the crew of five after six hours in hypothermic waters. The survivors were pilots Dave Ruvola and Graham Bushor, flight engineer Jim Miolli, and pararescue jumper John Spillane. The fifth member, pararescue jumper Rick Smith, was never found. They were all featured on the show I Shouldn't be Alive.|$|E
2500|$|To {{lengthen}} the canter, {{the rider}} uses {{his or her}} legs against the horse's sides in rhythm with the gait. The leg aids should be applied as the hind legs are engaging. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> the rider's seat moves forward in the canter stride. Additionally, the rider should engage the seat {{at the same time}} as the leg aids are used, [...] "rolling" [...] is forward with the canter motion. Contact may be lightened, but should not be dropped. The rider should not lean forward.|$|E
2500|$|Midwinter {{celebrations}} were {{an important}} part of Scandinavian culture since prehistoric times, and the term was retained to refer to [...] "Christmas" [...] after Christianization. In many countries Christmas is celebrated on the 25th of December, but in Denmark, and in the other Scandinavian countries, the most important day for celebrations is [...] Christmas Eve on the 24th when the family comes together. The morning can be spent in various ways but most often it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> preparations are made for the evening.|$|E

2500|$|Blooming <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> coffee plants bloom {{with white}} flowers which last for about 3–4 days (termed [...] "evanescent" [...] period) before they mature into seeds. When coffee {{plantations}} {{are in full}} bloom it is a delightful sight to watch. The time period between blooming and maturing of the fruit varies appreciably with the variety and the climate; for the Arabica, it is about seven months, and for the Robusta, about nine months. The fruit is gathered by hand when it is fully ripe and red-purple in colour.|$|E
2500|$|The {{potential}} to make the island habitable has substantially improved since then. A 2012 assessment from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory found that caesium-137 levels are dropping considerably faster than anyone expected. Terry Hamilton, scientific director of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory’s Marshall Islands Dose Assessment and Radioecology Program, reported that [...] "Conditions have really changed on Bikini. They are improving at an accelerated rate. By using the combined option of removing soil and adding potassium, we can get {{very close to the}} 15 millirem standard. That has been true for roughly the past 10 years. So now <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> the Bikinians, if they desired, could go back." ...|$|E
2500|$|Theodore Modis says [...] "nothing {{in nature}} follows a pure exponential" [...] and {{suggests}} the logistic function {{is a better}} fit for [...] "a real growth process". The logistic function looks like an exponential at first but then tapers off and flattens completely. For example world population and the United States's oil production both appeared to be rising exponentially, but both have leveled off because they were logistic. Kurzweil says [...] "the knee in the curve" [...] <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> the exponential trend is going to explode, while Modis claims if the process is logistic {{when you hit the}} [...] "knee" [...] the quantity you are measuring is only going to increase by a factor of 100 more.|$|E
