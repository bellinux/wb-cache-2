40|$|Introduction. User {{education}} is arguably {{one of the}} basic services of any library, since it responds to a pressing need for most users. In the case of health sciences libraries this need is even more explicit, given the little training in interrogation of databases and reference to sources of scientific information for most users throughout their academic journey. Therefore, from the Virtual Health Sciences of the Balearic Islands has always bet on training, offering courses in collaboration with the School of Public Administration of the Illes Balears (EBAP). Still, in 2009 was to give a qualitative and quantitative in this service by creating a training plan directly managed by the Virtual Library. Materials and methods. The organization of the training plan for documentation in health sciences 2009 - 2010 started from the analysis of the shortcomings of previous training plan, and the study of training needs of graduates and licensed health professionals working in the Balearic Islands Health Public System. Following this preliminary analysis, we established the primary objective of the plan and subsequently agreed on between the team of the library all relevant aspects of the organization and management of training activities, such as the topics covered, duration, location, staff, schedule training and teaching method. Once concretized these aspects, each of the training was accredited through the Balearic <b>Islands</b> <b>Commission</b> of Continuing Education of Health Professions.

Within the training plan 2009 - 2010 of the Virtual Library, a total of 28 courses and 24 sessions, with over 500 attendees and over 100 hours of instruction given. Conclusions. In conclusion from the results discussed above we can say that has contributed to the training of health professionals in the Balearic Islands in the use of new technologies and obtaining information from literature, helping to meet their information needs. The balance is very positive and we expect to continue to manage directly the service, including how to improve e-learning activities...|$|E
