40|$|Abstract: The Parkland {{formula is}} {{currently}} {{the most widely used}} protocol to guide fluid resuscitation of acute burns and has been adapted for pediatric use. We describe 3 novel graphic devices (a nomogram, slide rule, and <b>disc</b> <b>calculator)</b> based on this formula, which have significant advantages over existing graphic and electronic devices. The robust low-cost graphic devices would be particularly suited to developing countries and difficult locations, but could be used as the primary means of calculation in any environment. If a computer or calculator is used as the primary means of calculation, the graphic devices provide a simple and rapid means of checking and preventing errors that may arise because of inadvertent miskeying of data or incorrect application of the pediatric Parkland formula...|$|E
5000|$|We {{made this}} <b>disc</b> OK <b>Calculator</b> {{and left it}} in cafes and just {{different}} places. Just 24 tracks of four-track stuff. And that's on-line now. We sold {{a few of them}} on our first tour, a couple, but then the CD burner broke, etc. That's on-line and someone wrote about it as [...] "the extremely rare but superb OK Calculator" [...] and I’m sitting there going, [...] "Are you kidding me?" [...] Rare, yeah, rare because we're making them ourselves, and superb, that's not up to us, but it's not superb. (laughs) I’d be the first person to tell you. There's more hiss on some of those songs than there are songs. And it's fun, and I love it, but I wouldn't call it superb. Tunde Adebimpe ...|$|R
40|$|A brief {{introductory}} {{treatment is}} made of the physiology and instrumentation of the cardiovascular system. Two areas are singled out for further investigation. Arterial blood flow is investigated. In particular the effects of atherosclerosis on the pulse wave propagation through the arterial system are considered. A method for assessing arterial condition employing two ultrasonic Doppler flowmeters is proposed. A digital zero-crossing detection system is suggested {{as a means of}} producing a relatively simple and inexpensive instrument to provide real-time results. The performance of the heart as a pump and the parameters used to assess this performance are considered. One such parameter is the cardiac ejection fraction, which relates the stroke and end-diastolic volumes of the heart's left ventricle. A new method of estimating left ventricular volume from single-plane cineangiocardiograms is described. Called the Rectangular Rule, this method approximates the volume to a series of circular <b>discs.</b> A special-purpose <b>calculator</b> has been developed to implement the Rectangular Rule and to make cardiac ejection fraction estimations. Results of studies made of patients indicate that the calculator produces results at least as accurate as those of an other popular method, and that the cardiac ejection fraction is a valuable guide to surgical prognosis...|$|R
