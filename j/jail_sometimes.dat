50|$|Before its enactment, obstinate, anti-republican Catholic priests, called 'refractory clergy' (clergé réfractaire), were {{alleged to}} be royalist {{suspects}} by the Decree of 17 November 1791. Beginning on 10 August 1792, when the constitutional reign of Louis XVI was suspended by the Legislative Assembly, these priests, as well émigrés and their parents, had been expelled, deported, <b>jailed,</b> and <b>sometimes</b> murdered by radical revolutionary sans-culottes.|$|R
50|$|Conceptions {{of madness}} in the Middle Ages in Christian Europe were {{a mixture of}} the divine, diabolical, magical and humoral, {{as well as more}} down to earth considerations. In the early modern period, some people with mental {{disorders}} may have been victims of the witch-hunts but were increasingly admitted to local workhouses and <b>jails</b> or <b>sometimes</b> to private madhouses. Many terms for mental disorder that found their way into everyday use first became popular in the 16th and 17th centuries.|$|R

5000|$|The colonial jail {{differed}} from today's United States prisons {{not only in}} its purpose, but in its structure. Many {{were no more than}} a cage or closet. Colonial jailers ran their institutions on a [...] "familial" [...] model and resided in an apartment attached to the <b>jail,</b> <b>sometimes</b> with a family of their own. The colonial jail's design resembled an ordinary domestic residence, and inmates essentially rented their bed and paid the jailer for necessities.|$|E
5000|$|Tyrmand, {{although}} he declares himself a firm anti-communist, gets involved in neither a political nor ideological argument with communism. Józef Hen observes, [...] "in Diary, {{there is not}} a single word about the exiles, trials, Tito, Korea, spies, <b>jail</b> tortures". <b>Sometimes</b> the author expresses himself almost positively, for example about Vladimir Lenin. The criticism of the political system prevailing in Poland is concerned with its civilisational and aesthetical aspects. For instance in a few places Tyrmand complains about a dirt plague in Warsaw.|$|R
50|$|Convictions {{for traffic}} {{violations}} are usually penalized with fines, {{and for more}} severe offenses, the suspension or revocation of driving privileges. Convictions for alcohol offenses generally result in the revocation or long term suspension of the driver's license, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>jail</b> time and/or mandatory alcohol rehabilitation.|$|R
50|$|At {{the age of}} 22, Zuğurlu protested in {{solidarity}} with several Kurdish prisoners which resulted in her getting arrested and sentenced to a 13-month prison term for alleged stone throwing. Two years after being released from prison, in March 2014, she ran for public office, for the post of mayor. She stated that the <b>jail</b> cells <b>sometimes</b> housed up to 45 women, some of them teenagers, with the majority being Kurds. Zuğurlu spent eight months in the Diyarbakır Prison, a notorious place of torture. She dreamed of entering politics while serving her jail term.|$|R
50|$|Driving a {{motor vehicle}} while {{intoxicated}} on alcohol is a misdemeanor which carries a penalty of up to one year in the county jail. Subsequent offenses may be charged as a felony under certain circumstances. In practice driving {{a motor vehicle}} while intoxicated will result in probation for first offenses, along with hefty fines, alcohol education, and community service. Subsequent offenses usually result in {{a small amount of}} jail time along with probation. Public intoxication on alcohol is a misdemeanor under state law and also under most municipal ordinances. Public intoxication on alcohol is often not prosecuted and the offender is released after sobering up in <b>jail.</b> <b>Sometimes,</b> depending on criminal history, those convicted of public intoxication may serve very small jail sentences.|$|E
50|$|Ramsay {{continued}} {{occasionally to}} put down written Parliamentary questions from <b>jail,</b> <b>sometimes</b> taking up the cases of fellow 18B internees. His eldest son Alec, serving in the Scots Guards, died of pneumonia on active service in South Africa in August 1943. Ramsay was finally released from detention on 26 September 1944, {{being one of the}} last few 18B detainees. He immediately returned to Westminster to resume his seat in the Commons, causing at least one member to storm out of the chamber. His only significant action in the remainder of the Parliament was a motion calling for the reinstatement of the 1275 Statute of the Jewry passed under King Edward I. He did not defend his seat in the 1945 general election.|$|E
50|$|However, {{some people}} do not like Subbulakshmi and her daughters, mainly Kulasekharan. He hates Subbulakshmi {{because he does not}} like {{the fact that she is}} sharing spouse space with Naachiyar. Kulasekharan is {{supported}} by his daughter, Ilavanji and her husband, Ayyaa's son Karthik. He only wants his sister Naachiyar to be called Ayyaa's wife and no one else. Therefore, he tries to get rid of Subbulakshmi, Ganga, Ramaa and Charu and banish them from the village. He tries to kill Selvakannan, tries to separate Ramaa and Jayachandran and cheats Subbulakshmi into letting him out of <b>jail.</b> <b>Sometimes</b> the attempts he make succeed slightly, and some fail miserably and even backfire on him. Naachiyar does not give in to Kulasekharan's intentions because she loves Subbulakshmi like her own sister.|$|E
50|$|If the {{motorist}} pleads guilty, {{the outcome is}} equivalent to conviction after trial. Upon conviction, {{the motorist}} is generally fined a monetary amount and, for moving violations, is additionally given demerit points, under each province's point system. <b>Jail</b> time is <b>sometimes</b> sought in more serious cases such as Racing or Stunt Driving.|$|R
2500|$|During {{his years}} as {{president}} (known popularly in Dominican politics as simply [...] "the twelve years"), Balaguer ordered the construction of schools, hospitals, dams, roads, and many important buildings. He also presided over steady economic growth. Granted although he did fund public housing and opened public schools and expanded education during his term, also more than 3,000 Dominicans were assassinated between 1966 and 1974. Additionally over 300 politicians became millionaires during his [...] "presidency". [...] However, his administration soon developed a distinct authoritarian cast, constitutional guarantees notwithstanding. Political opponents were <b>jailed</b> and <b>sometimes</b> killed, and opposition newspapers were occasionally seized. Despite his authoritarian methods, Balaguer had far less power than Trujillo, and his rule was milder.|$|R
5000|$|Invented in {{the early}} 19th century, the tramp chair was a cage made of bent and riveted metal {{strapping}} {{into the shape of}} a chair. An individual could be placed inside the chair and locked up securely, the chair thus acting as a jail cell, particularly in towns too small to build a <b>jail.</b> It was <b>sometimes</b> placed on a wheeled platform so it could be moved around easily.|$|R
40|$|In {{the late}} 18 th {{and through the}} 19 th century there was a marked {{increase}} in the number of people who suffered from what they called “fevers”. Among those recognized by physicians, two were of particular interest to the government and the merchant classes: gaol (or <b>jail,</b> <b>sometimes</b> spelled “jayle”) fever and ship fever. The first of these had been mentioned in a book published as early as 1547 by Boorde, 1 who called it the “sycknesse of prisons”. In 1750 it was described by Sir John Pringle, 2 physician to the armed forces. Ship fever, described by Lind, a naval surgeon, in 1774, 3 was important because it affected the efficiency of the navy when the country was at war and because sickness among the crews of merchant ships affected trade and profit. As long as gaol fever affected only the inmates of prisons it was of little concern to the government and the public. At times of gaol delivery, however, when prisoners were brought into court for trial, court officers, officials and spectators were liable to be affected. The first of what became known as “Black Assizes ” was at Cambridge in 1522. The cause was said to be “foul air ” and the pestilential savour, whether arising from the “noisome smell ” of the prisoners or from the “damp of the ground ” and the “filth of the house”. The next was that at Oxford in 1577 when note was made of the nauseating stench that came from the cells beneath the courtroom, which housed some 300 prisoners in close confinement. This incident was followed by an epidemic in the city that killed 300 people. After the Assizes in Exeter in 1586, there seems to be an absence of further reports until 1730 when, at the Lent Assize at Taunton, several high officials succumbed – allegedly as a result of the infected stench of the prisoners brought from Ilchester Gaol. Probably the last was the Black Assize at the Old Baile...|$|E

50|$|The {{constitution}} {{provides for}} the right to strike, and workers sometimes exercised it. In small and medium-sized businesses, workers effectively did not have the ability to strike. With an enormous unemployed labor pool, companies could immediately replace any workers attempting to unionize, collectively bargain, or strike, and companies reportedly did so during the year. The law requires unions to have prior consent and to adhere to lengthy mandatory arbitration and appeal procedures before striking. The law prohibits employers and the government from retaliating against strikers; however, the transitional government did not enforce this law in practice and <b>sometimes</b> <b>jailed</b> striking public sector employees.|$|R

50|$|The most {{controversial}} of the ordinances was the Zina Ordinance, {{by which the}} Pakistan Penal Code provisions relating to adultery were replaced. Women and men found guilty were to be flogged a hundred stripes apiece if unmarried, and stoned to death if married. Uncorroborated testimony by women was inadmissible in hudood crimes, so in cases of rape, victims were sometimes charged with fornication and jailed and their rapists were freed because the women could not comply with the Islamic Hadd requirements of four reputable Muslim males testifying to the crime. Girls as young as twelve were also <b>sometimes</b> <b>jailed</b> and prosecuted for having extra-marital intercourse because the ordinance abolished Pakistan's statutory rape law.|$|R
5000|$|Cyril [...] "Sonny" [...] Moorman (born 1955) is an American power blues guitarist. His {{style is}} {{sometimes}} {{compared to that}} of the Duane Allman, Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Lonnie Mack, Gov't Mule, and occasionally Warren Haynes. [...] Moorman's parents owned a nightclub called the [...] "Half-Way Inn" [...] located half way between Hamilton, Ohio and Middletown, Ohio on Ohio State Route 4 where he was able to watch musicians who played there, such as Lonnie Mack, from an early age. Moorman attended Michigan State University and also graduated from the Musicians Institute in Hollywood. He also owned a music lesson studio in Fairfield, Ohio called Rock School, and now offers guitar lessons out of 3rd Street Music in Hamilton, Ohio. He {{has been a member of}} Warren Zevon's touring band and the Tomcats with members of Sly and the Family Stone. One of his signature tunes is his cover of Lonnie Mack's Cincinnati <b>Jail.</b> Moorman <b>sometimes</b> plays a Jamon Zeiler crafted Acoustic guitar and a 2004 model Gibson Flying V Reissue. On some tunes Sonny plays Slide guitar either upright or laptop. The band has opened for Johnny Winter in 2012.|$|R
5000|$|The brig {{was used}} {{throughout}} the Korean War and almost {{to the end of}} the Vietnam War. During warmer months, it was not uncommon for boats navigating the river to hear shouts and whistles coming from within barred windows of [...] "the Fortress." [...] In 1974 the Department of Defense developed a three-tiered, regional correctional facility plan. Inmates would be placed depending on the service, sentence length, geographical location, and treatment programs. First-tier offenders are those with sentences less than a year, second-tier up to 7 years. Male convicts from all the services sentenced to punitive discharge and incarceration longer than 7 years are confined at the third-tier - the maximum-security U. S. Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. The Portsmouth Naval Prison, built to be a modern correctional facility for a navy which had once disciplined by flogging and capital punishment, was rendered obsolete. After containing about 86,000 military inmates over its 66-year operation, the brig closed in 1974, its maintenance thereafter contributing to shipyard overhead.The Navy briefly used the prison in the early 1980s to train military corrections officers. Volunteer Inmates from the Rockingham County <b>Jail</b> were <b>sometimes</b> used.|$|R
40|$|Specific and {{marginal}} general deterrence {{are being}} increasingly discredited as useful sentencing objectives. One {{reason is that}} offenders discount <b>jail</b> time, <b>sometimes</b> quite substantially. As a consequence, {{there is a significant}} difference between the court 2 ̆ 7 s sentence and the effective penalty. The latter is the offender 2 ̆ 7 s perceived duration of the time in jail. Discount rates, which perhaps can be thought of as a measure of acclimatisation to the prison experience, potentially weaken considerably the likelihood of successfully attaining the objective of specific deterrence. In addition, since jail time discount rates increase as the sentence length increases, punishment burden increases less than proportionately. This means that successfully achieving marginal deterrence is even more problematical. Using New South Wales data for three different offences, mean estimates of jail time discount rates are obtained, and then used to adjust downwards court sentences and estimate their effective equivalents. Effective sentence elasticities are then computed to gauge the impact of sentence doubling. Very low values are obtained. The critical implications for sentencing suggested by this study are, first, that absolute general deterrence and specific deterrence are realistic sentencing objectives. Marginal deterrence, however, does not seem to be attainable, given the ubiquity of positive time preference. Secondly, subject to the proportionality constraint, relatively shorter sentences are likely to be more punitive than longer ones, and therefore more effective as specific deterrents...|$|R
5000|$|The United Nations Population Fund {{writes that}} [...] "Family {{planning}} {{is central to}} gender equality and women's empowerment". Women in many {{countries around the world}} are denied medical and informational services related to reproductive health, including access to pregnancy care, family planning, and contraception. In countries with very strict abortion laws (particularly in Latin America) women who suffer miscarriages are often investigated by the police under suspicion of having deliberately provoked the miscarriage, and are <b>sometimes</b> <b>jailed,</b> a practice which Amnesty International called a [...] "ruthless campaign against women's rights". Doctors may be reluctant to treat pregnant women who are very ill, because they are afraid the treatment may result in fetal loss. According to Amnesty Intentional, [...] "Discriminatory attitudes towards women and girls also means access to sex education and contraceptives are near impossible El Salvador". The organization has also criticized laws and policies which require the husband's consent for a woman to use reproductive health services as being discriminatory and dangerous to women's health and life: [...] "For the woman who needs her husband's consent to get contraception, the consequences of discrimination can be serious - even fatal".|$|R
50|$|Suspension or {{temporary}} exclusion {{is mandatory}} leave {{assigned to a}} student {{as a form of}} punishment that can last anywhere from one day to a few weeks, during which time the student is not allowed to attend regular lessons. In some US, UK, Australian and Canadian schools, {{there are two types of}} suspension: In-School (ISS, Internal Exclusion or Isolation) and Out-of-School (OSS, Off-Campus Suspension, External Exclusion). In-school requires the student to report to school as usual but attend a designated suspension classroom or room all day. Out-of-school suspension bans the student from being on school grounds during school hours while school is in session. Students who breach a suspension by attending school may be arrested for, and charged with trespassing. This could result in an extension of suspension, community service, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>jail</b> time. Students who continue to breach a suspension could be expelled from school and sentenced to longer, more severe punishments. Students are also not allowed to attend after school activities (such as proms, sporting events, etc.) while suspended from school.Schools are often required to notify the student's parents/guardians of the reason for and duration of the out-of-school suspension, and usually also for in-school suspensions. Suspended students are often required to continue to learn and complete assignments from the days in which they miss instruction.|$|R
50|$|In academia, {{suspension}} (also {{known as}} temporary exclusion) is a mandatory leave {{assigned to a}} student {{as a form of}} punishment that can last anywhere from one day to several weeks, during which time the student is not allowed to attend regular school lessons. The student's parents or guardians are usually notified as to the reason for and the duration of the suspension. Sometimes students have to complete work during their suspensions for which they will receive no credit. Also, upon returning to school, it is often mandatory that the student, his/her parents/guardians, and a school administrator have a meeting to discuss and evaluate the matter. If the suspension is related to the symptoms of a disability or the student is receiving special education or mental health services, students may be required to consult their case manager, counselor, or school psychologist before and/or after the suspension. In some schools, this meeting is prior to the suspension. Applications to some colleges ask the student whether or not they have ever been suspended. In some places in the United States, a suspension is noted on one's transcript. However, other places do not report suspensions or are expressly forbidden from doing so under state law. Students who breach a suspension (attend the school while suspended) may be arrested for, and charged with trespassing. This could result in an extension of suspension, community service, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>jail</b> time. Students who continue to breach a suspension could be expelled and sentenced to longer, more severe punishments.
