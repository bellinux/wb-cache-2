40|$|In this paper, the {{behaviors}} of 14 <b>H-section</b> <b>steel</b> beams in fire are investigated. The test is carried out by use of the self-made fire-test furnace. The lengths of beams are 4200 mm and 3600 mm. The temperature field and deflection of beams in fire are measured. The effect of connection, boundary condition and axial restraint on {{the behaviors}} of steel beams is also studied. The test indicates that local buckling and lateral torsional buckling of <b>H-section</b> <b>steel</b> beams occur in fire. The behaviors of <b>H-section</b> <b>steel</b> beams in fire are influenced by connection and axial restraint. When the beams undergo a large deflection, compression force then quickly changes into tension force, which supports the beam and reduces further deflection, and the catenary action takes place. The test results in this paper {{may be used to}} guide the design of this type of steel beams in fire...|$|E

An applicability of the proposed method and the absorbing performance of the two-layered absorbing system are investigated by conducting prototype impact test. From this study, {{it is confirmed that}} (1) this proposed retaining-wall system with two-layered absorbing system has high absorbing and impact resistant performances; (2) bending stresses caused in the H-section steels and steel piles are affected by the size of H-section steel; and (3) bending stresses developed in the steel piles can be restrained by decreasing the size of <b>H-section</b> <b>steel</b> because of the displacement of the retaining-wall being increased...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{test results}} of nine stub-column tests {{performed}} on partially encased composite (PEC) columns made with welded <b>H-section</b> <b>steel</b> are described and presented. The <b>H-section</b> <b>steel</b> is stiffened with transverse link and concrete is poured between the flanges {{of the steel}} section. The axial comprehensive study has been conducted on all specimens to investigate the ultimate axial capacity of PEC columns. The failure of all columns is due to local buckling of the flanges along with concrete crushing. Closer link spacing improves the ductility of the columns; however, the measurements show that in general yielding do not occur before the peak load in the links. The additional longitudinal bars have no a remarkable effect {{to the strength of}} the composite columns. Finally, an equation is proposed to predict the ultimate axial capacity of the partially encased composite column...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWith {{the rapid}} {{development}} of the express railways in China, {{a large number of}} express railway station buildings have been constructed in recent years. Steel reinforced concrete (SRC) girders are used in many buildings for express railway stations. It is a new subject for fatigue behavior of SRC girders under daily train loading. This subject is discussed preliminarily in the current paper. Fatigue tests on three SRC girders were carried out in Tongji University. The test specimens, testing program as well as experimental results are presented. The fatigue failure characteristics of the SRC girders are described in detail and compared with the static failure characteristics. It was found that the fatigue cracking was initiated at the weld toe of shear studs on the tension flange of welded <b>H-section</b> <b>steel</b> inside the SRC girder and then the crack propagated along the flange width and the web height until the girder lost loading capacity due to lack of enough cross section. The fatigue strength of the welded <b>H-section</b> <b>steel</b> {{played a key role in}} the fatigue strength of SRC girders. Suggestions for improving the fatigue strength of SRC girders and future research work are proposed finally...|$|E

50|$|When the {{planning}} application for Phase 4 was submitted, {{it was expected}} that construction would commence in July or August 2007. Construction of Phase 3 commenced in July 2007. Bachy Soletanche Ltd, who received the £1.5 million contract, commenced work on the site by installing a deep contiguous piled wall around the site. The 220 m perimeter wall consists of 241 contiguous piles, which were chosen by project design consultant WSP. The piles are 750 mm in diameter. The piles will hold back the ground that consists of a few metres of fill, then a 3 m to 5 m thick sand layer which becomes weathered sandstone further down. Because the bedrock slopes from 2 m to 14 m down across the site, the piles must be up to 17.5 m deep. As excavation on the site commenced, the company installed 70 ground anchors to the wall. Each of the anchors are 15 m long and 178 mm diameter. These are for temporary support of the wall whilst the basement is being constructed. When construction is completed, they will remain. Some of the piles were drilled using a cased Large Diameter Auger (LDA) rotary bored piling method, while other parts of the wall were drilled using the Continuous Flight Auger (CFA) method. Alongside the contiguous piled wall, Bachy Soletanche Ltd also constructed ten 1200 mm diameter LDA plunge column piles and fourteen 750 mm diameter bearing piles.Ten plunge columns were installed on the site for the main access ramp. These consisted of large, <b>steel</b> <b>H-section</b> columns surrounded by pea gravel within their pile casings. Bachy Soletanche installed a basic bored pile with casing and then used its special plunge column rig to achieve the 5 mm accuracy needed for the positioning of the I section steel columns.

40|$|Six welded <b>H-section</b> <b>steel</b> {{specimens}} {{subjected to}} the axial compressive load, the in-plane shear force and the resulting bending moment around the cross-section major axis are tested monotonically to investigate the elasto-plastic interactive buckling performances of beam-columns. The specimens are designed to fail due to local interactive buckling which is monitored by strain gauges and displacement meters. Strain curves and displacement curves varying with the shear force are illustrated, based on which the local interactive buckling is identified and the ultimate moment capacity of the specimen is extracted. The tests reveal that the local buckling of the web and flange in the compression zone occurs simultaneously resulting in the decrease of the ultimate moment capacity of the specimen. The normalized moment versus rotation curves are illustrated and compared in pairs to investigate {{the effects of the}} axial compression ratio, the flange width-thickness ratio and the web height-thickness ratio on the normalized ultimate moment capacity, which is defined as the ratio of the ultimate moment over the plastic moment. It is observed that the normalized ultimate moment capacity decreases remarkably as the axial compression ratio or the flange width-thickness ratio increases, but varies little as the web height-thickness ratio increases...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe yield {{strength}} and tensile {{strength of the}} steels are varied by pre-straining, dynamic loading and temperature. In addition, the fracture toughness is strongly affected by the strength variation. Therefore, the fracture assessment of steel weldments under seismic loading condition needs to be considered the effects of strength variation caused by cyclic and dynamic large strain. In WES 2808 : 2003, the estimation method of strength increase with superposition effect of pre-straining, dynamic loading and temperature was proposed in the strength range of 400 - 590 MPa class steel plate, 400 - 490 MPa class <b>H-section</b> <b>steel</b> and 590 MPa class weld metal. However, 780 MPa class steel plate has recently begun to be applied in building structures. Therefore, the strength range of the estimation method needs to be expanded. In this study, the dependence of strength variation on pre-straining for 780 MPa class steel plate was investigated by experiment. And {{the applicability of the}} WES 2808 strength estimation methods for 400 - 780 MPa class steel was investigated. As a result, the effects of pre-straining on both the {{yield strength}} and tensile strength of the 780 MPa class steel were revealed. In addition, new equations that are based on old equations of WES 2808 : 2003 for estimating the strength with varied pre-straining are proposed.

40|$|The tall noise {{barriers}} recently installed on Shinkansen structures {{have a low}} natural frequency. Therefore, they may resonate with dynamic loads such as seismicity which have not been a crucial condition for their design. The {{aim of this study}} is to understand the dynamic response characteristics of the tall noise barrier during seismicity and to evaluate its seismic safety. Conclusions on the basis of numerical studies are as follows: 1) the noise barrier resonates with the yield frequency of structures during the L 2 earthquake, while it resonates with the elastic natural frequency of structures when structures respond elastically in such cases as L 1 earthquake. This phenomenon becomes significant with the increase of the seismic yield coefficient. 2) In order to evaluate the seismic response of noise barrier, it is necessary to take account of the influence of the dynamic interaction between the noise barrier and the structure, because the transfer function of the noise barrier substantially depends on the interaction. 3) The L 1 earthquake can cause cracks at the top of bridge railing, and the L 2 earthquake can cause the yield of <b>H-section</b> <b>steel</b> which supports the noise barrier. 4) The L 2 earthquake can provide a severer design condition than the wind load for the noise barrier whose natural frequency is 5 Hz or less...|$|E
