25|$|Australian rules {{football}} was first played in Melbourne, Victoria in 1858, and {{developed over the}} following decades.

500|$|For each extension, the {{long-term}} plan {{was that the}} expansion was [...] "temporary" [...] until the line was extended past Waterloo, and therefore these additions were simply added alongside and around the existing structure rather than {{as part of an}} overall architectural plan. This resulted in the station becoming increasingly ramshackle. The platform numbering had grown <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>ad</b> hoc manner, resulting in the confusing situation of No.1 being {{in the middle of the}} station complex, where it had been since 1848. [...] The original station became known as the [...] "Central Station" [...] as other platforms were added. The new platform sets were known by nicknames – the two platforms added for suburban services in 1878 were the [...] "Cyprus Station", and the six built in 1885 for use by trains on the Windsor line became the [...] "Khartoum". Each of these stations-within-a-station had its own booking office, taxi stand and public entrances from the street, as well as often poorly marked and confusing access to the rest of the station.|$|E

Here they were gathered together <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>ad</b> hoc formation known as the [...] "Lonsdale Force" [...] after Major Richard Lonsdale who was put in command. The Lonsdale Force deployed to the south-east of Oosterbeek to defend the division's artillery line. Here, as dusk approached, Lance Serjeant John Baskeyfield of the Staffords, although wounded and {{with the rest of his}} men dead or wounded, engaged three tanks as they emerged from the woods with his anti-tank gun. He destroyed the first tank and disabled the second before his own weapon was destroyed. Moving to a nearby gun where the crew were already dead, he continued to fight the third tank alone. Shortly after he managed to disable it, he was killed a shell from a German tank. For his actions Baskeyfield received a posthumous Victoria Cross, the highest British military decoration. The KOSB had by now arrived at the perimeter being formed around Oosterbeek and took up positions south of the railway line just north of division headquarters.|$|E
