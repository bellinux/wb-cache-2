60|$|It 's, {{a regular}} right down {{struggle}} between the two. I've no patience with this Roberts, <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>'ear</b> he's just an ordinary workin' man {{like the rest of}} 'em. If he did invent a thing he's no worse off than 'undreds of others. My brother invented a new kind o' dumb-waiter--nobody gave him anything for it, an' there it is, bein' used all over the place.|$|R

I put him down as dotty, but my! you should have heard him when he found out that the stuff had been lifted!" ...|$|R

I am afraid, though, {{he will not be}} of any use to you, for <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> can <b>hear</b> he is quite poor. However, Engleton ought to be quite enough if we can keep him in the humour for playing." ...|$|R

500|$|Classic Coronation Street was a {{recreation}} of 1960s Coronation Street. It starred Wood as the show's gossiping Ena Sharples, with Julie Walters as Martha Longhurst and Lill Roughley as Minnie Caldwell, with Ena telling them the [...] "gossip" [...] she has {{heard about the}} show's plotlines {{for the next two}} decades. The sketch was written with a detailed knowledge of the soap opera's past: [...] "That stuck up Ida Barlow, who's no better than she should be... it'll not be too long before she falls under a bus! That Harry Hewitt'll likely get crushed under the axle of 'is own van, and as for Valerie Barlow – and if this isn't judgement for setting 'erself up in 'er own front parlour as a so-called 'air stylist then my name isn't Ena Sharples – <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>'ear,</b> it's two clogs to a threpenny bit that she'll electrocute 'erself with 'er own 'airdryer." [...] This sketch's accuracy earned Wood praise from Doris Speed, who had played Annie Walker in Coronation Street from 1960 to 1983.|$|R

6000|$|She {{paused for}} a moment before she replied;--but she could not bring herself to be {{absolutely}} honest in the matter. [...] "No;--she didn't send me. But <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> see and <b>hear,</b> <b>I</b> am quite sure she does not wish to go on with it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor young woman. She {{has lost}} her husband, and, I am afraid, now has lost her friends also. I {{am told that}} she is not well off;--and <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> see and <b>hear,</b> <b>I</b> fancy that here in England a young lady without a dowry cannot easily replace a lover. I suppose, too, Miss Trefoil is not quite in her first youth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here, sir," [...] he declared. [...] "Every three months, {{within a}} day or two, cash--five hundred pounds. Here you are. Here's the last: March 27--cash, £500! Look back! January 1--By cash £500! October 2--cash, £500! There you are, right back to the very day he arrived in England. And he left South Africa with ten bob of mine in his pocket, after he'd paid his passage! and <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> can <b>hear,</b> he never did a day's work after he landed. And me over there working {{thirteen}} and fourteen hours a day, and half the time stony-broke! There's a brother for you! Cain was a fool to him!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, we must hope he will, Mrs. Prothero; that seems, <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>hear,</b> {{the only}} chance there is of the {{regiment}} winning a prize. So all our sympathies will be with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I presume, Mr. Tallboys, <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>hear,</b> {{that you}} are as {{thoroughly}} convinced as I am myself that this will of Mr. Penfold's is in existence, and is hidden somewhere about the Hall?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will soon}} work it down again, Mike. <b>From</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> of Spain, {{there is no}} fear of your getting too much food there. Rough work and small rations are, I hear, the rule." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{reader will}} easily believe, that <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had <b>hear</b> and seen, my keen {{appetite}} for perpetuity {{of life was}} much abated. I grew heartily ashamed of the pleasing visions I had formed; and thought no tyrant could invent a death into which I would not run with pleasure, from such a life. The king heard of all that had passed {{between me and my}} friends upon this occasion, and rallied me very pleasantly; wishing I could send a couple of struldbrugs to my own country, to arm our people against the fear of death; but this, it seems, is forbidden by the fundamental laws of the kingdom, or else I should have been well content with the trouble and expense of transporting them.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am, nevertheless, glad to {{have been}} of service to you, gentlemen," [...] he said, courteously; [...] "at least you are Irishmen, and I have many good friends countrymen of yours. And you have still another claim upon us all, for are you not here to aid us to shake off this French domination? I hope that you are comfortable, but judging <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> see and <b>hear</b> when passing <b>I</b> fear that your lodging is a {{somewhat}} noisy one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But {{to reverse}} this process, to cram {{positive}} teaching down their throats upon {{the authority of the}} Church before they know what the Church is, or feel the need of any power outside (so to speak) their own minds to guide them, does seem to me {{in a place like this}} (humanly speaking) suicidal. I cannot, of course, tell how much preparatory teaching they have received, but <b>I</b> must judge <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> see and <b>hear,</b> and deal accordingly in each cottage. Some few there are to whom I can speak, as to Church people in the real sense of the word, but these are as two or three in a hundred.|$|R

6000|$|... "Whatever your {{inclination}} {{leads you}} to, my boy. I thought {{it right to}} give you the option of the army, but you shut the door on that, and I was glad. I don't expect you to choose just yet--by-and-by, when you have looked about you a little more and tried your mettle among older men. The university has a good wide opening into the forum. There are prizes to be won, and a bit of good fortune often gives the turn to a man's taste. <b>From</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> see and <b>hear,</b> <b>I</b> should think you can take up anything you like. You are in the deeper water with your classics than I ever got into, and if you are rather sick of that swimming, Cambridge is the place where you can go into mathematics with a will, and disport yourself on the dry sand as much as you like. I floundered along like a carp." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll {{excuse me}} if I'm a bit excited, Mr. Wrayson," [...] he continued. [...] "I'll leave you to judge how I've been served {{when you hear}} all. He got over me, and I lent him nearly half of my savings, and he started back to England. He took this flat at two hundred pounds a year the very week he got back, and he's lived, <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> can <b>hear,</b> like a lord ever since. Will you believe this, sir! He sent back the money he {{borrowed}} from me a quid at a time, and wrote me {{to say he was}} saving it with great difficulty--out of his salary of three pounds a week. When he'd paid back the lot, I never heard another line from him. I was doing rotten myself, and he knew well enough that I should have been over first steamer if I'd known about his two hundred a year flat, {{and all the rest of}} it. What do you think of my brother, sir, eh? What do you think of him? Treated me nicely, didn't he? Nine pounds ten it was I lent him, and nine pounds ten was all I had back, and here he was living like a duke, and lying to me about his three pounds a week; and there was I hawkering groceries on a barrow, selling sham diamonds, any blooming thing to get a mouthful to eat. Nice sort of brother that, eh? What?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look yer, Don Kosay," [...] {{he began}} in a brusque but guarded voice, [...] "you and me is pards. When ye picked me and the mare up and set us on our legs again in this yer ranch, I allowed I'd tie to ye {{whenever}} you was in trouble--and wanted me. And <b>I</b> reckon that's <b>what's</b> the matter now. For <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> see and <b>hear</b> on every side, although you're the boss of this consarn, you're surrounded by a gang of spies and traitors.

6000|$|... "Yes,--the Eustace diamonds! And they didn't {{belong to}} her {{any more than}} they did to you. They've been taken, anyway; and <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> I shouldn't be at all {{surprised}} if she had arranged the whole matter herself." ...|$|E
