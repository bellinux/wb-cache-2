5|$|The disease-modifying {{treatments}} {{have several}} adverse effects. One {{of the most}} common is irritation at the injection site for glatiramer acetate and the interferons (up to 90% with subcutaneous injections and 33% with intramuscular injections). Over time, a visible dent at the injection site, due to the local destruction of <b>fat</b> <b>tissue,</b> known as lipoatrophy, may develop. Interferons may produce flu-like symptoms; some people taking glatiramer experience a post-injection reaction with flushing, chest tightness, heart palpitations, and anxiety, which usually lasts less than thirty minutes. More dangerous but much less common are liver damage from interferons, systolic dysfunction (12%), infertility, and acute myeloid leukemia (0.8%) from mitoxantrone, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy occurring with natalizumab (occurring in 1 in 600 people treated).|$|E
25|$|The correct {{technique}} maximizes fat graft survival by minimizing cellular trauma {{during the}} liposuction harvesting and the centrifugal refinement, and by injecting {{the fat in}} small aliquots (equal measures), not clumps (too-large measures). Injecting minimal-volume aliquots with each pass of the cannula maximizes the surface area contact, between the grafted fat-tissue and the recipient breast-tissue, because proximity to a vascular system (blood supply) encourages histologic survival and minimizes the potential for fat necrosis. Transplanted autologous <b>fat</b> <b>tissue</b> undergoes histologic changes like those undergone by a bone transplant; if the body accepts the fat-tissue graft, it is replaced with new <b>fat</b> <b>tissue,</b> if the fat-graft dies it is replaced by fibrous tissue. New <b>fat</b> <b>tissue</b> is generated by the activity of a large, wandering histocyte-type cell, which ingests fat and then becomes a fat cell. When the breast-filler fat is injected to the breasts in clumps (too-large measures), fat cells emplaced too distant from blood vessels might die, {{which can lead to}} <b>fat</b> <b>tissue</b> necrosis, causing lumps, calcifications, and the eventual formation of liponecrotic cysts.|$|E

40|$|Although {{stem cells}} from mice {{deficient}} of FGF 2 {{have been reported to}} display enhanced capacity for adipogenesis, the literature using in vitro cell culture system has so far reported conflicting results on the role of FGF 2 in adipogenesis. We here demonstrate that FGF 2, depending on concentration, can function as either a positive or negative factor of in vitro adipogenesis by regulating activation of the ERK signaling pathway. FGF 2 at concentrations lower than 2 ng/ml enhanced in vitro adipogenesis of human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs). However, FGF 2 at concentrations higher than 10 ng/ml was able to suppress adipogenesis by maintaining sustained phosphorylation of ERK and function as a dominant negative adipogenic factor toward BMP ligands. Expression levels of FGF 2 in the <b>fat</b> <b>tissues</b> from high <b>fat</b> diet induced obese C 57 BL/ 6 mice were lower than those from normal chow diet mice, indicating that expression levels of FGF 2 in the <b>fat</b> <b>tissues</b> might be in reverse correlation with the size of <b>fat</b> <b>tissues.</b> Our observation of concentration dependent biphasic effect as well as dominant negative effect of FGF 2 on adipogenesis provides a mechanistic basis to understand roles of FGF 2 in adipogenesis and development of <b>fat</b> <b>tissues...</b>|$|R

25|$|Thiopental {{rapidly and}} easily crosses the {{blood brain barrier}} {{as it is a}} {{lipophilic}} molecule. As with all lipid-soluble anaesthetic drugs, the short duration of action of sodium thiopental is due almost entirely to its redistribution away from central circulation towards muscle and <b>fat</b> <b>tissue,</b> due to its very high fat:water partition coefficient (aprx 10), leading to sequestration in <b>fat</b> <b>tissue.</b> Once redistributed, the free fraction in the blood is metabolized in the liver.

40|$|The mRNA {{levels for}} the {{mitochondrial}} uncoupling protein (UCP 1) in <b>fat</b> <b>tissues</b> of A/J and C 57 BL/ 6 J inbred strains of mice varied in a regional-specific manner after stimulation of adrenergic signaling by cold exposure or treatment with a beta 3 -adrenergic agonist. While {{the differences between}} strains were minimal in interscapular brown fat, large differences occurred in white <b>fat</b> <b>tissues,</b> particularly in retroperitoneal fat. Among the AXB recombinant inbred strains, the Ucp 1 mRNA levels varied up to 130 -fold. This large induction at the mRNA level {{was accompanied by a}} corresponding increase in brown adipocytes as revealed by immunohistology with anti-UCP 1 antibodies. A high capacity to induce brown fat in areas of traditional white fat had no impact on the ability to gain weight in response to high fat and sucrose diets, but did correlate with the loss of weight in response to treatment with a beta 3 -adrenergic agonist (CL 316, 243). This genetic variation in mice provides an experimental approach to identify genes controlling the induction of brown adipocytes in white <b>fat</b> <b>tissues...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{surgical}} implantation approach effects the global augmentation {{of the breast}} hemisphere using a breast implant, either an implant filled with saline-solution, or an implant filled with silicone-gel; moreover, the surgical augmentation approach can include the application of transplanted autologous skin flaps harvested from the woman's body.

25|$|The {{distribution}} of adipose (<b>fat)</b> <b>tissue</b> changes slowly over months and years.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a first {{evaluation of the}} feasibility of Finite Element modelling of the orbital decompression, {{in the context of}} exophthalmia. First simulations are carried out with data extracted from a patient TDM exam. Results seem to qualitatively validate the feasibility of the simulations, with a Finite Element analysis that converges and provides a backward movement of the ocular globe associated with displacements of the <b>fat</b> <b>tissues</b> through the sinuses. This FE model can help a surgeon for the planning of the exophthalmia reduction, and especially for the position {{and the size of the}} decompression hole. To get an estimation of the <b>fat</b> <b>tissues</b> volume affected by the surgery, an analytical model seems to provide quicker results for an equivalent efficiency...|$|R
50|$|In {{the obese}} mouse models, {{inflammation}} and macrophage-specific genes are upregulated in white adipose tissue (WAT). There were also signs of {{dramatic increase in}} circulating insulin level, adipocyte lipolysis and formation of multinucleate giant cells. The fat-derived protein called angiopoietin-like protein 2 (Angptl2) elevates in <b>fat</b> <b>tissues.</b> Higher than normal Angptl2 level in <b>fat</b> <b>tissues</b> develop inflammation as well as insulin and leptin resistance. Stored fat secretes Leptin to signal satiety. Leptin resistance {{plays a role in}} the process where appetite overrules the message of satiety. Angptl2 then starts an inflammatory cascade causing blood vessels to remodel and attract macrophages. Angptl2 is an adipocyte-derived inflammatory mediator linking obesity to systemic insulin resistance. It is possible that, as an inflammatory marker, leptin responds specifically to adipose-derived inflammatory cytokines.|$|R
25|$|The {{biologic}} {{survival of}} autologous <b>fat</b> <b>tissue</b> {{depends upon the}} correct handling of the fat graft, of its careful washing (refinement) to remove extraneous blood cells, and of the controlled, blunt-cannula injection (emplacement) of the refined fat-tissue grafts to an adequately vascularized recipient site. Because the body resorbs some of the injected fat grafts (volume loss), compensative over-filling aids in obtaining a satisfactory breast outcome for the patient; thus the transplantation of large-volume fat grafts greater than required, because only 25–50 per cent of the fat graft survives at 1-year post-transplantation.|$|E
25|$|During this period, also in {{response}} to rising levels of estrogen, {{the lower half of}} the pelvis and thus hips widen (providing a larger birth canal). <b>Fat</b> <b>tissue</b> increases to a greater percentage of the body composition than in males, especially in the typical female distribution of breasts, hips, buttocks, thighs, upper arms, and pubis. Progressive differences in fat distribution as well as sex differences in local skeletal growth contribute to the typical female body shape by the end of puberty. On average, at 10 years, girls have 6% more body fat than boys.|$|E
25|$|The {{advent of}} liposuction {{technology}} facilitated medical {{applications of the}} liposuction-harvested <b>fat</b> <b>tissue</b> as autologous filler for injection to correct bodily defects, and for breast augmentation. Melvin Bircoll introduced the practice of contouring the breast and for correcting bodily defects with autologous fat grafts harvested by liposuction; and he presented the fat-injection method used for emplacing the fat grafts. In 1987 the Venezuelan plastic surgeon Eduardo Krulig emplaced fat grafts with a syringe and blunt needle (lipo-injection), and later used a disposable fat trap to facilitate the collection and to ensure the sterility of the harvested adipocyte tissue.|$|E

The careful harvesting and centrifugal refinement of the mature adipocyte tissue (injected in small aliquots) allows the transplanted <b>fat</b> <b>tissue</b> to remain viable in the breast, where it provides the anatomical structure and the hemispheric contour that cannot be achieved solely with breast implants or with corrective plastic surgery.|$|E

The TRAM flap (Transverse Rectus Abdominis Myocutaneous flap) procedure reconstructs the breast using an autologous flap of abdominal, cutaneous, and muscle tissues. The latissimus myocutaneous flap employs skin fat and muscle harvested from the back, and a breast implant.
