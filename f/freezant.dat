40|$|ABSTRACT The {{number of}} viable aerobic {{microorganisms}} on the thighs of broiler chickens was determined {{before and after}} freezing using the following four freezing methods: (1) air blast at- 29 ° C, (2) liquid nitrogen spray at- 196 ° C, (3) "Nitreon " at- 51 ° C, and (4) "Freon Food <b>Freezant</b> 12 " immersion at- 30 ° C. The chicken thighs were stored at- 18 ° C. for 4 weeks and thawed at 0. 6 ° C. for 20 hr. They were then inoculated with a 24 hr. culture of Salmonella typhimurium. The number of S. typhimurium of each chicken thigh was determined before and after freezing using the most probable number (MPN) method. Statistical {{analysis of the data}} showed that {{there was no significant difference}} (P <. 05) between the freezing methods. However, it was possible to rank the freezing methods according to the average percentage reduction in the total viable aerobic microorganisms and the average percentage reduction in S. typhimurium. The possibility of microorganisms being washed into the liquid "Freon Food <b>Freezant</b> 12 " is discussed. Because the liquid <b>freezant</b> is reused to freeze subsequent batches of the product, the need for further work to confirm the presence or absence of S. typhimurium is stressed. It is suggested that a possible public health hazard could be reduced if a bacterial filter through which the liquid <b>freezant</b> can be recycled were used. Also, a spraying technique for liquid <b>freezant</b> is suggested. The importance of plant sanitation is stressed...|$|E
