5|$|After electing to bat, Australia {{made history}} {{on the first}} day by {{breaking}} the record for the most runs scored in a first-class match in a day. Ironically, {{it was the only time}} they were dismissed in a single day on the entire tour. With centuries from Brown (153), Bradman (187), Loxton (120) and Saggers (104*), Australia's first innings totalled 721; they were dismissed on the close of the first day's play. Bradman's 187 came in 155 minutes and Brown's 153 lasted three hours; the pair put on 219 in 90 minutes after Barnes fell for 79 at 145/1. Bradman came in and seized the initiative, reaching 42 in the 20 minutes before lunch, including five fours from one over by Frank Vigar which subsequently entered Essex club folklore. Bradman and Brown were parted when the latter fell at 364/2 only halfway through the day's play. Miller then famously deliberately allowed himself to be bowled first ball as a protest against Australia's merciless crushing of their hosts, something that angered his captain and batting partner Bradman. Miller later told Dickie Bird that he had wanted to go to the local horse races, but this was refused by Bradman. The all rounder therefore made his duck in protest, but still did not <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to the races. Later, Loxton and Saggers made 166 in 65 minutes for the sixth wicket, before a late-order collapse saw Australia lose 5/57, leaving Saggers unbeaten, but not before he reached the only first-class century of his career. After being demoralised by the Australian batsmen {{on the first day}}, Essex made only 83 in their first innings, capitulating within 37 overs. Toshack took 5/31 and Miller 3/14, and Australia enforced the follow-on. Essex's second innings appeared to be heading the same way when four early wickets to Johnson had them at 46/6. However, a partnership of 133 between Tom Pearce and Peter Smith for the seventh wicket salvaged some respectability before they were out for 187. Johnson ended with 6/37 as the Australians dismissed their hosts twice in a single day. The ground attendance of 32,000 was a record.|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} the 1965 season Tauranac {{was losing}} {{interest}} in this arrangement, reasoning that [...] "it {{was just a matter of}} a lot of effort for no real interest because I didn't <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> racing very much" [...] and [...] "I might as well get on with my main line business, which was selling production cars." [...] Although Brabham investigated using chassis from other manufacturers, the two men eventually agreed that Tauranac would have a greater interest in the Formula One team, which MRD eventually took over completely from BRO. This agreement was not reached until November 1965. Repco delivered the first example of the new engine to the team's headquarters in the United Kingdom in late 1965, just weeks before the first Formula One race to the new regulations, the non-championship South African Grand Prix on 1 January 1966. Rather than build a new car in the limited time available, BRO pressed chassis number F1-1-1965, the sole and unused BT19, into service.|$|E
500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an 'A', saying [...] "Community is going {{away for a}} while, but it's going away with an episode that reminds me why I love the show so much. This is a very {{personal}} thing—since humor's subjective like that—but for me, this was the funniest episode since the clip show... I laughed myself silly at this one, {{to the point where}} I was devolving into hiccups at certain scenes, and I'm glad we <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out on an episode like this, one that plays around with form and makes me laugh." [...] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix also praised the Glee-spoofing, saying [...] "'Regional Holiday Music' was the logical, clever, funny endpoint to it." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste said, [...] "As with its best theme-episodes, the show bridged the gap between high-concept parody and character-based comedy." [...] TV Fanatic's Leigh Raines gave the episode a 4/5 rating, saying while the show [...] "definitely went out with a bang, it didn't totally blow my socks off... While there were a few moments that upped the ick factor, overall this episode fell on the positive side." [...] She praised Troy and Abed's rap performance, but called the scene where Annie seduces Jeff [...] "creepy". Robert Canning of IGN said it was a [...] "great" [...] episode, but [...] "faltered just a bit" [...] at the end: [...] "Abed's realization that his attempts to brighten the holiday only made things darker, as Jeff had previously suggested, fit the character well enough, but the study group's follow-up felt a bit forced and holiday hokey. Of course, that could well have been the point." ...|$|E
500|$|Mystic Quest was {{developed}} in a graphic and gameplay style similar to Final Fantasy Legend III (part of the aforementioned SaGa series). The gameplay shares numerous similarities with that title, featuring a very similar battle system, graphical interface, and dungeon system. Even the jump feature from Final Fantasy Legend III has been reproduced, {{and almost all of}} the icons - from caves to the enemy sprites - are a color-upgraded version of Final Fantasy Legend IIIs character set. Besides allowing for computer-controlled allies, the game did away with random battles, complicated storylines, and text-based menus. To appeal to the perceived tastes of North American audiences, which gravitated towards fast-paced games, Square included action-adventure game elements; players could now brandish weapons outside of battle, jump, use a grappling hook, and set bombs to open new paths. North American translator Ted Woolsey explained that [...] "The action/adventure players...are larger in numbers and the demographic is different. They tend to be younger and like the idea of jumping straight into the action with a sword in their hands; it's an empowerment issue - you <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out there, start whacking things and it feels good! With the more traditional RPGs, it takes a good 15 or 20 hours of playing before you're finally hooked." [...] Woolsey stated that Mystic Quest was one of the easiest games he had to translate, due to the game's small size. Because the game was marketed towards a younger demographic, the game sold for US$39.99. Mystic Quest also came with an Official Strategy Guide that helped inexperienced and new RPG players complete it.|$|E

500|$|Devitt {{returned}} to New Japan on 8 October at King of Pro-Wrestling, challenging IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion Low Ki to a title match, {{after he had}} regained the title from Kota Ibushi. On 21 October, Apollo 55 entered the 2012 Super Jr. Tag Tournament, defeating Chaos World Wrestling Warriors (Brian Kendrick and Low Ki) in their first round match. On 2 November, Devitt and Taguchi defeated the reigning IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Champions, the Forever Hooligans (Alex Koslov and Rocky Romero), {{to advance to the}} finals of the tournament, where, later that same day, they were defeated by the Time Splitters (Alex Shelley and Kushida). On 11 November at Power Struggle, Devitt defeated Low Ki to win the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship for the third time. On 4 January 2013 at Wrestle Kingdom 7 in Tokyo Dome, Devitt defeated Low Ki and Kota Ibushi in a rare three-way match for his first successful defense of the title. Following his win, Devitt accepted a challenge for the title made by his tag team partner, Ryusuke Taguchi. On 3 February, Devitt picked up a big win, when he pinned reigning IWGP Heavyweight Champion Hiroshi Tanahashi in a tag team match, where he and Karl Anderson faced Tanahashi and Taguchi. Seven days later, Devitt defeated Taguchi at The New Beginning for his second successful defense of the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship. On 3 March, Devitt main evented New Japan's 41st anniversary event, losing to Hiroshi Tanahashi in a non-title match. Following the loss, Devitt began portraying a more cocky and villainous persona, regularly disrespecting both partners and opponents, with the exception of Ryusuke Taguchi, whom he tried to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> along with his new attitude. On 5 April, Devitt defeated Alex Shelley for his third successful defense of the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship. Two days later at Invasion Attack, Apollo 55 unsuccessfully challenged Time Splitters for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship, after which Devitt turned on Taguchi, ending the longtime partnership between the two, and debuted Bad Luck Fale as his new [...] "bouncer", while also dubbing himself the [...] "Real Rock 'n' Rolla".|$|E
500|$|On February 3, 2013, IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion Prince Devitt pinned IWGP Heavyweight Champion Hiroshi Tanahashi in a tag team match, {{where he}} and Karl Anderson faced Tanahashi and Devitt's {{longtime}} Apollo 55 tag team partner Ryusuke Taguchi. This led to a match between Devitt and Tanahashi on March 3 at NJPW's 41st anniversary event. Though neither man's title {{was on the line}} in the match, Tanahashi vowed to relinquish the IWGP Heavyweight Championship in case Devitt was victorious. After defeating Devitt, Tanahashi went to help his opponent up, but was pushed away by the disappointed Junior Heavyweight Champion. The following weeks, Devitt began portraying a more cocky and villainous persona, regularly disrespecting both partners and opponents, with the exception of Ryusuke Taguchi, whom he tried to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> along with his new attitude. However, this changed on April 7 at the Invasion Attack pay-per-view, when Devitt turned on Taguchi, after the two had failed to recapture the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship from the Time Splitters (Alex Shelley and Kushida). During the attack, Devitt was helped by the returning King Fale, who attacked not only Taguchi, but also Shelley, Kushida and Captain New Japan, whom Devitt then proceeded to unmask. Following the attack, Devitt took a microphone, introduced Fale as his new [...] "bouncer", giving him the new name [...] "The Underboss" [...] Bad Luck Fale and dubbed himself the [...] "Real Rock 'n' Rolla". At the following pay-per-view, Wrestling Dontaku 2013 on May 3, Devitt and Fale teamed up {{for the first time to}} defeat Taguchi and Captain New Japan in a tag team match. Later in the event, Devitt and Fale entered the ring to attack the now former IWGP Heavyweight Champion Hiroshi Tanahashi, after he had defeated Karl Anderson in a singles match. Anderson first went to stop Devitt and Fale, but then turned on Tanahashi, hitting him with the Gun Stun. As the three men continued their attack on Tanahashi, they were also joined by Tama Tonga, with whom Anderson had formed a partnership during the past two weeks. In a post-match interview, the four men announced the formation of an all-gaijin stable named [...] "Bullet Club".|$|E

2500|$|In June 2014, after a {{television}} series {{extension of the}} One-Shot Agent Carter was ordered by ABC, the short's composer Christopher Lennertz talked {{about the possibility of}} him being involved with the series saying Louis D'Esposito, the One-Shot director also involved with the series, wanted Lennertz involved, before officially signing on to compose for the series that September. On his music for the series, Lennertz said, [...] "I get to mix {{a lot of things that}} don’t often <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> together in terms of period, music, jazz, trumpet, mixed with orchestra, mixed with electronics and brushes on a drum set and things." [...] He researched [...] "what was going on between '46 and 1950 and what it was that would be part of that era ... I knew Count Basie. I knew Glenn Miller, all those things were happening at the time, but then we also figured out that it was sort of changing from big band to smaller jazz ensembles." [...] This led to Lennertz focusing a lot on trumpets for Peggy Carter's sound, [...] "which makes a lot of sense because it’s also very sneaky, and it lends itself to espionage and that kind of thing". Lennertz introduced a folk choral piece performed by a Russian men's choir during [...] "The Iron Ceiling".|$|E
2500|$|When {{interviewed by}} FourFourTwo magazine, McManaman stated, [...] "I think I {{probably}} least enjoyed my time when Glenn Hoddle was the manager. But I wouldn't {{say he was}} necessarily the worst. He had his ways of training and ways of acting and all managers have different ways of doing things; it's the same with club managers. Sometimes when you join up with England and you don't play {{as often as you}} did under a certain other manager – then you'll think it's terrible. I loved going to play with England. For instance, I did <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to the World Cup even though I only played for 17 minutes. That kind of experience leaves an indelible mark on your mind. So I don't really think of it in terms of [...] "worst"; but going to the World Cup and not playing much was a big thing for me, really, and that was under Glenn, of course." [...] Hoddle also notably arranged for McManaman to meet a disabled fan (and thus fulfill his lifelong wish of meeting McManaman) while the fan {{was on the verge of}} death, in 1997, to great media acclaim, though the story only broke a year after Hoddle had been sacked from the England job for alleged disparaging comments about disabled people.|$|E
2500|$|Kevin Harvick {{dominated}} {{the race to}} score the victory. [...] "Wow. I guess that's {{what it feels like}} to hit a walkoff in extra innings. I mean this thing -- both races here -- has been bad to the bone," [...] Harvick said after winning his fourth race at this 1-mile oval in the last five tries. Harvick would not have made the final four to race for the title without a win. I could tell that we were going to have to win because everybody was running in the front of the pack that we were racing against. I think this says a lot about our team. We had our backs against the wall. We're in victory lane and we <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on." [...] In the final turn, Ryan Newman sent Kyle Larson into the wall to secure his place in the championship race. “I just gave it my all,” Newman said. “I wasn’t proud of it but did what I had to get to this next round. That little boy has got a lot of things coming in this sport and he used me up like that in a truck at Eldora a couple years ago. From my standpoint, I call it even but I think if he was in my position, he’d have done the same thing.” [...] "Coming to the finish, there were a lot of cars racing really hard,” said Larson today. “I knew (Newman) was right around me and knew he needed to gain some spots to keep from getting eliminated from the Chase. It's a little upsetting he pushed me up to the wall, but I completely understand the situation he was in,” said Larson, “(I) can't fault him for being aggressive there. I think a lot of drivers out here would have done something similar if they were in that position." [...] Kevin Harvick (with the much-needed win), Joey Logano, Denny Hamlin, and Ryan Newman were the four drivers who will race for the championship, which also meant that NASCAR will be having a new Sprint Cup Series champion. Jeff Gordon, Carl Edwards, Brad Keselowski, and Matt Kenseth were the four drivers eliminated.|$|E
