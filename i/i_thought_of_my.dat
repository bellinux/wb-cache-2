60|$|Involuntarily <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> new house,--not a {{soothing}} reflection.|$|E
60|$|And <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mother, {{and then}} of my new {{loneliness}} and the hunger of my heart for Nettie.|$|E
60|$|MRS. MEGAN. I wished I 'adn't jumped--an' <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> baby-- that died--and--[in {{a rather}} {{surprised}} voice] and I thought of d-dancin'.|$|E
60|$|MARY. Nay, {{not well}} said; <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> you, <b>my</b> liege, Ev'n as I spoke.|$|R
60|$|MORELL. Candida: you are {{shocking}} me. <b>I</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> attractions. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> your goodness--your purity. That is what I confide in.|$|R
60|$|CRICHTON. <b>I</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> her, <b>my</b> lady, {{in another}} connection.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{looked and}} felt the ground rock under my feet. For Se√±orita Anabela Zamora was the most {{beautiful}} woman in the world, and the only one from that moment on, so far as Judson Tate was concerned. I saw at a glance that I must be hers and she mine forever. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> face and nearly fainted; and then <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> other talents and stood upright again. And I had been wooing her for three weeks for another man! ...|$|E
60|$|In this emergency, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> kind friend, Mr. Fauntleroy, {{and went}} to the bank, and saw him once more in his private room.|$|E
6000|$|... "When you {{described}} the young man, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> poor boy, didn't I, Julia?" [...] cries the mother, with {{tears streaming down}} her face.|$|E
60|$|For days <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> little else. <b>My</b> laundress--as we {{call them}} in the Temple--noticed my trouble.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> Kookooskoos and <b>my</b> own head, {{but said}} nothing. They {{would only have}} resented the suggestion.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! but I did not know,' said Cora; 'I had {{not been}} here--and <b>I</b> only <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own {{pleasure}} in having her. But {{if there is any}} way of freeing her from this unfortunate speculation without a dead loss, I will make father tell me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> {{poor old}} French colonel and his broken parole; and was silent. [...] "Can you {{not tell me}} the circumstances?" [...] I {{suggested}} at length.|$|E
6000|$|... "We saw {{the fire}} but White Buffalo thought {{there might be}} some unfriendly Indians or trappers around. So then <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> old whistle. I knew you would {{recognize}} it." ...|$|E
6000|$|That held me perplexed for a space. [...] . Well, anyhow I {{was leaving}} it all! Thank God I was leaving it all! Then, as I {{turned to go}} on, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mother.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{but look}} at others who have tried, felt their duties, and cared for souls; while <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> only <b>of</b> <b>my</b> vows as a restraint, and tried how much {{pleasure}} I could get in spite of them. A pretty story of all the ministry I shall ever have." ...|$|R
6000|$|MERTOUN. [...] --We'll waste no breath [...] On aught less precious. I'm {{beneath the}} roof [...] Which holds her: while <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> that, <b>my</b> speech [...] To you would wander--as {{it must not}} do, [...] Since as you favour me I stand or fall. [...] I pray you suffer that I take my leave! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{were pretty}} heavy, Jack. Once or twice <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> dumping <b>my</b> share <b>of</b> them, but it's {{fortunate}} that Hollin, {{who seemed to}} suspect my intentions, kept his eye on me when I got played out. You see, an assayer we took them to found that they were rich in lead and silver." ...|$|R
60|$|She looked bewitching as {{she stood}} {{pleading}} her cause in front of me. And yet, as <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> dead men, I could not take the hand which she held out to me.|$|E
6000|$|I {{turned my}} head away in {{bitterness}} as <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own folly. Why had I never happened to walk out this way with fifty thousand dollars in my pocket and buy all this beautiful mud? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite so!" [...] I said, {{my heart}} sinking as <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> {{conversation}} with Sergeant Daw in the morning, {{and of the}} disturbing and harrowing fears which it had left in my mind. He went on: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> {{showing it}} to you--I <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> showing it to every one. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> paying <b>my</b> {{debt to the}} Bellegardes that way. So I told them, and I frightened them. They have been staying in the country as you tell me, {{to keep out of}} the explosion. But I have given it up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There, {{that will}} have to do,' said Violet at last. 'I am so sorry to have made such a fool of myself. I don't err upon the sentimental side as a rule. I suppose it is about time that <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> {{catching}} <b>my</b> train for town. I have a theatre engagement which I must not miss.' ...|$|R
60|$|At first <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> {{retracing}} <b>my</b> {{steps and}} acquainting my comrades {{with the discovery}} I had made; but the little probability there was <b>of</b> <b>my</b> finding them within several hours deterred me. Besides, I felt ashamed to confess that I had been afraid to prosecute the chase alone; so, after pondering the matter a little, I decided on advancing.|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{often did}} I weep when <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> child united not {{with one of}} her own race. When I saw in my dreams grandchildren--pale little ones that I could not love, I cared {{scarcely}} to live," [...] she said, pathetically.|$|E
60|$|The fearful {{responsibility}} {{was more}} than I could bear. I fell into a veritable agony; I trembled and even wept a little. Then <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> father and {{what he would do}} in such circumstances, and began to pray as I had never prayed before.|$|E
60|$|Yet always when <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> {{life as a}} whole, Mary ruled it. With {{her alone}} I had talked of my {{possible}} work and purpose; to her alone had I confessed to ambitions beyond such modest worthiness as a public school drills us to affect....|$|E
6000|$|Now I {{had what}} I wanted--the saving mark for my eyes. But <b>I</b> hardly <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> other self, now {{gone from the}} ship, to be hidden forever from all {{friendly}} faces, to be a fugitive and a vagabond on the earth, with no brand of the curse on his sane forehead to stay a slaying hand [...] . too proud to explain.|$|R
6000|$|It was so; {{but being}} {{a couple of years}} older I had left before he joined. After a quick {{interchange}} of dates a silence fell; and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> suddenly <b>of</b> <b>my</b> absurd mate with his terrific whiskers and the [...] "Bless my soul--you don't say so" [...] type <b>of</b> intellect. <b>My</b> double gave me an inkling <b>of</b> his <b>thoughts</b> by saying: ...|$|R
6000|$|Quite involuntarily, when <b>I</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> portmanteau, <b>I</b> had flung up {{the left}} arm (fingers fully extended) and {{clutched}} at my diaphragm with my right hand. I am an acutely self-conscious man at all times. The gesture struck me as absolutely novel for me. I repeated it, for my own satisfaction. [...] "Odd!" [...] Then (rather puzzled) I turned to my portmanteau.|$|R
60|$|Then {{they were}} upon me--or almost. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> promise to Dian--the awful abyss was behind me--a big devil {{with a huge}} {{bludgeon}} in front of me. I grasped my six-shooter by the barrel and hurled it squarely in his face with all my strength.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> poor {{mother and}} my sisters, at the old house in Killaloo--I felt {{the tip of his}} blade between my teeth--I breathed a prayer, and shut my eyes--when the tables were turned--the {{butt-end}} of Lanty Clancy's musket knocked the sword up and broke the arm that held it.|$|E
60|$|But <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mother, {{and would}} not commit myself further, and I rose to leave him; I had, however, waited too long. The mob were surging along the streets, as they always did when the magistrates {{came home from the}} Parliament, howling, bellowing, and yelling round the unpopular ones.|$|E
60|$|But here I had {{an object}} which was indeed worth a sacrifice, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> no more <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life than <b>of</b> the clods of earth that flew from my darling's heels.|$|R
6000|$|... "He told me {{something}} of it, but very vaguely," [...] I ventured to say deprecatingly; [...] "but I {{am afraid that}} <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> more <b>of</b> seeing <b>my</b> old friend again than of anything else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't {{know what}} to do!' said Louis. 'When <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> the aim <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life was to be to devote myself to his wishes, you--ay, and he too--tell me to stand alone.' ...|$|R
