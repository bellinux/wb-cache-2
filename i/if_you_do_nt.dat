2500|$|It {{was taught}} in a Baraita that Issi ben Judah {{said that there are}} five verses in the Torah whose {{grammatical}} construction cannot be decided. (Each verse contains a phrase that a reader can link to the clause either before it or after it.) Among these five is the phrase [...] "lifted up" [...] ( [...] , seit) in [...] (One could read [...] to mean: <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> well, good! But you must bear the sin, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not do well. Or one could read [...] to mean, in the usual interpretation: <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> well, there will be forgiving, or [...] "lifting up of face." [...] And <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not do well, sin couches at the door. In the first reading, the reader attaches the term [...] "lifted up" [...] to the following clause. In the second reading, the reader attaches the term [...] "lifted up" [...] to the preceding clause.)â€“b1. Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 1998[...]|$|R
