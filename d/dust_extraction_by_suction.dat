25|$|Ophthalmology {{was one of}} the {{foremost}} branches in medieval Islamic medicine. The oculist or kahhal (کحال), a somewhat despised professional in Galen’s time, was an honored member of the medical profession by the Abbasid period, occupying a unique place in royal households. Medieval Islamic scientists (unlike their classical predecessors) considered it normal to combine theory and practice, including the crafting of precise instruments, and therefore found it natural to combine the study of the eye with the practical application of that knowledge. The specialized instruments used in their operations ran into scores. Innovations such as the “injection syringe”, a hollow needle, invented by Ammar ibn Ali of Mosul, which was used for the <b>extraction</b> <b>by</b> <b>suction</b> of soft cataracts, were quite common.|$|R
50|$|Essential {{safety gear}} needed is {{closed-in}} footwear, very high grade ear protectors (especially {{if using a}} high-revving electric plane or router), eye shields when cutting or grinding metal, disposable gloves when gluing, close-fitting clothes that will not get caught in drills. Good light is essential. Boat builders should not work when they are tired and should keep the work floor clean so they don't trip over tools or wood or electric leads. A fan is handy for extra ventilation if the work space does not have many opening windows or doors. Many boat builders like smaller tools to be bright-coloured tools {{so they can see}} them easily amongst saw dust. With the recent technological advances in materials being used in modern boat building including GRP and FGRP repiratory protection masks have become essential in many workshops. The only suitable alternative being substantial <b>dust</b> <b>extraction</b> equipment <b>by</b> means of on-tool extraction or a fully fit out environmental cleaning workshop installation.|$|R

40|$|Due to {{its high}} strength-to-weight ratio, {{composite}} materials {{have been widely}} applied in aerospace manufacturing. However, some challenges are facing in fabrication and {{assembly of the parts}} with composite materials. One of them is how to collect the dwarf and dust generated from the drilling operation, especially in an open environment when the composite parts are assembled, since a large number of holes need generating to rivet the parts together when the parts with composite materials are assembled in an aircraft structure. The efficiency of <b>dust</b> <b>extraction</b> is crucial to the healthy operating environment {{and the quality of the}} assembled component. In this paper, three conceptual designs of automatic <b>dust</b> <b>extraction</b> are proposed and compared, and the best design with the hood fastened on the drilling spindle has been selected and analyzed. Its design parameters have been identified; a systematic procedure has been proposed for the design optimization; the process of the <b>dust</b> <b>extraction</b> has been modeled and simulated using the COSMOSFloWorks. Taguchi method is applied to optimize the design. The process of the <b>dust</b> <b>extraction</b> has been validated through animation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} the technologies employed {{to develop a}} successful solution to minimise dust emissions using calibrated discrete element modelling (DEM) and new <b>dust</b> <b>extraction</b> technology. The case study comprised of a large crushing station that screens and crushes oversize product. The coal processed varies from dry dusty coal to wet cohesive coal that can often block sections of the transfer chute. The air generation can often be significant in the stilling chamber on the out-going conveyor due to the large drop height, making it a formidable task to design a reliable <b>dust</b> <b>extraction</b> system. Material testing for DEM calibration purposes was conducted on representative samples of dry and wet coal {{in order to improve}} the accuracy of the solution. A new <b>dust</b> <b>extraction</b> system was designed and installed to extract the airborne dust, including respirable particles using a combination of misting and high efficiency cyclone technologies...|$|R
