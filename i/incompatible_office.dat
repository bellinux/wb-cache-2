60|$|Such is {{the history}} of Mr. Sulivan's service from the time of his appointment; such were the qualifications, and such the proofs of assiduity and {{diligence}} given by him in holding so many <b>incompatible</b> <b>offices,</b> (as well as being engaged in other dealings, which will appear in their place,) when, after three years' desultory residence in India, he was thought worthy to be nominated to the succession to the Supreme Council. No proof whatsoever of distinguished capacity in any line preceded his original appointment to the service: so that the whole of his fitness for the Supreme Council rested upon his conduct and character since his appointment as Persian Translator.|$|R
5000|$|Microsoft Agent {{replaced}} the original Microsoft Bob code in Office 2000, although this use {{did not include}} Agent's much-touted speech synthesis or recognition capabilities {{or any of the}} four Microsoft Agent characters. Instead the Office team created their own characters including one dubbed [...] "Clippit" [...] or [...] "Clippy". However, Bob Actors or Office 97 assistants are <b>incompatible</b> with <b>Office</b> 2000 and later versions, and vice versa.|$|R

25|$|He fired an advisor (who {{happened}} to be Jewish; {{and a member of}} the Romanian Chamber of Deputies) Nati Meir. Tudor claimed it was due to allegations of bribery, but Meir claimed it was due to antisemitism.

50|$|The Perpetual Edict (Dutch: Eeuwig Edict) was a {{resolution}} of the States of Holland passed on 5 August 1667 which abolished the office of Stadtholder in the province of Holland.

5000|$|Arion made {{significant}} efforts {{to reverse the}} policies adopted by Spiru Haret, his National Liberal predecessor. He sacked Haret's favorites {{and replaced them with}} Junimea men, but also introduced legislation which made bureaucratic <b>office</b> <b>incompatible</b> with a teaching position. The two politicians also differed in matters of church policies. Haret had favored the married clergy over the elitist Romanian Synod, creating a [...] to represent both sides. Arion reversed that reform, and unwittingly prolonged the conflict well into the 20th century.|$|R

50|$|De Veau had further {{argued that}} the passage in 1959 of the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA) also preempted the interstate compact. Title V of the LMRDA {{specifically}} imposed restrictions on union officers, clearly preempting any state action in this area, De Veau said. The majority disagreed. Passage of Title V of the LMRDA, Frankfurter wrote, shows just the opposite—that Congress did not find state restrictions {{on the right to}} hold union <b>office</b> <b>incompatible</b> with pre-1959 federal labor policies. Furthermore, Frunkfurter interpreted Section 504(a) and Section 603(a) of the LMRDA as specifically disclaiming of preemption of state laws regulating union officials (which only a few, limited, express exceptions).|$|R

5000|$|Chen's {{trial began}} in late March 2008. He was {{represented}} by Beijing lawyers Gao Zicheng and Liu Limu. He faced three charges: embezzlement, misuse of official powers, and behavior <b>incompatible</b> with his <b>office.</b> Chen acknowledged that he was [...] "partially responsible" [...] for the pension fund scandal, but pleaded 'not guilty' to the charges. However, he was found guilty by the court. At {{the end of the}} court session on March 25, Chen stated [...] "I am sorry to the party, the people of Shanghai, and my family". On April 11, 2008, Chen, 61, was sentenced to 18 years in prison for accepting $340,000 in bribes and abusing power, specifically, for stock manipulation, financial fraud and his role in the city pension fund scandal, at the No. 2 Intermediate People’s Court, Tianjin.|$|R

5000|$|A {{week after}} the crash, Bolivian police {{detained}} two individuals on criminal charges related to the crash of Flight 2933. The general director of LaMia was detained on various charges, including involuntary manslaughter. His son, {{who worked for the}} DGAC, was detained for allegedly using his influence to have the aircraft be given an operational clearance. A prosecutor involved with the case told reporters that [...] "the prosecution has collected statements and evidence showing the participation of the accused in the crimes of misusing influence, conduct <b>incompatible</b> with public <b>office</b> and a breach of duties." [...] An arrest warrant was issued for the employee of AASANA in Santa Cruz who had initially refused to approve Flight 2933's flight plan before takeoff and later approved. She fled the country seeking political asylum in Brazil, claiming that after the crash she had been pressured by her superiors to alter a report she had made before the aircraft took off and fearing that Bolivia would not give her a fair trial. A warrant was also issued for the arrest of another of LaMia's co-owners, but he still had not been located four weeks after the crash.|$|R
40|$|The present {{auditory}} study aims at identifying ERP correlates for {{the processing}} of both sentence accents as such and their compatibility relative to a context question (information structure). The employed German sentence material is based on that introduced by Steinhauer, Alter and Friederici (1999) but varies the positions of accents (as indicated by capitals). Moreover, all sentences were preceded by context questions establishing a narrow focus on one sentence constituent such that only the corresponding accentuation pattern provided an appropriate answer: question: WHO promises to help Anna and to clean the office? compatible answer: (S 1) PETER promises to help Anna and to clean the <b>office.</b> <b>incompatible</b> answer: (S 2) Peter promises to help ANNA and to clean the <b>office.</b> Note that <b>incompatible</b> answers violate the required information structure in two ways: (1) they do not provide the required accent on the element in focus and (2) they contain an inappropriate accent. 22 undergraduate students participated in this experiment and judged the prosodic compatibility of questions and answers. Preliminary ERP data suggest that in compatible answers, lexical elements carrying the respective accent elicit a centro-parietal positivity. The ERP patterns for incompatible answers {{appears to be more}} complex. Depending on both the type of violation and the position in the sentence we observed either a negative slow wave or a biphasic sequence of components...|$|R
