As with wet suits, their buoyancy and thermal protection decreases with depth as the air bubbles in the neoprene are compressed. The air or other gas in the <b>dry</b> <b>fabric</b> undergarments providing insulation under a dry suit is also compressed, but can be restored to an effective volume by inflating the drysuit at depth through an inflator valve, thus preventing [...] "suit squeeze" [...] and compacting of the air-filled undersuit.

Studies report an improvement to in-plane mechanical properties due to stitching, whereas others find unchanged or degraded properties.The data assembled for stitched laminates reveal that the tension, compression, flexure, shear and open-hole strengths are improved or degraded up to 20% by stitching relative to those of unstitched laminates.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{penetration}} {{failure mechanisms}} of “armor-grade ” fiber-reinforced composites with very low resin content were assessed under transverse impact loading {{in comparison with}} those of <b>dry</b> reinforcing <b>fabrics.</b> Failure of <b>dry</b> <b>fabrics</b> consisted of the suc-cessive fracture of individual yarns along {{the periphery of the}} penetrating head as well as the movement of yarns slipping off from the penetrator. In contrast, the principal yarns in the composites, which faced the penetrating head, failed to carry the load mostly through fracture due to the constraint of the resin matrix and the reduced yarn mobility. As a result, the composites absorbed more energy than the fabrics. The ratio of the number of broken yarns in the fabrics to that of the composites correlated quite well with the corresponding ratio of energy absorbed, confirming that fiber straining is responsible for most of the en-ergy absorption in penetration failure. Numerical modeling was utilized to show that yarn slippage in the fabrics results in a smaller effective penetrator radius leading to a decrease in energy absorption capacity with equal penetrator masses. Although the resin matrix itself did not absorb significant amounts of energy, it certainly had an indirect effect on the en...|$|R
50|$|This {{alternative}} method {{to the standard}} stitching process was first introduced in the late 1980s and was commercially developed by the company Aztex as Z-Fiber™ technology. “This technology consists of embedding previously cured reinforcement fibers into a thermoplastic foam that is then placed {{on top of a}} prepreg, or <b>dry</b> <b>fabric,</b> lay-up and vacuum bagged.” 12 The foam will collapse as temperature and pressure are increased, which allows the fibers to be slowly pushed into the lay-up. 3D reinforcement in regards to Z-pinning is necessary to introduce a mechanical link between the different plies of the composite lamina, this link being a stiff carbon fiber rod in Z-pinning. Z-pin (carbon fiber of small diameter embedded in the thickness direction-z) composites are a means to provide higher through-the-thickness stiffness and strength that 2D woven composites do not possess.|$|E
50|$|Stitching {{is arguably}} the {{simplest}} of the four main textile manufacturing techniques and {{one that can be}} performed with the smallest investment in specialized machinery. Basically stitching consists of inserting a needle, carrying the stitch thread, through a stack of fabric layers to form a 3D structure. The advantages of stitching are {{that it is possible to}} stitch both dry and prepreg fabric, although the tackiness of the prepreg makes the process difficult and generally creates more damage within the prepreg material than in the <b>dry</b> <b>fabric.</b> Stitching also utilizes the standard two-dimensional fabrics that are commonly in use within the composite industry therefore there is a sense of familiarity concerning the material systems. The use of standard fabric also allows a greater degree of flexibility in the fabric lay-up of the component than is possible with the other textile processes, which have restrictions on the fibre orientations that can be produced.|$|E
50|$|It {{consists}} of inserting a thread through a layered <b>dry</b> <b>fabric,</b> using a needle that, after insertion, moves {{back along the}} same trajectory leaving a loop of the thread {{on the bottom of}} the structure. It is a technology developed for and used within the thermoset resin injection manufacturing route, however it is currently being debated whether also pre-pregs can be successfully tufted. Tufting is considered a more economical and flexible method compared to 3D weaving or 3D braiding to include z-fibres in laminated composites. It resembles stitching, but it is different in that tufting only requires access from one side of the preform. Depending on the equipment used, all shapes and forms may potentially be reinforced by tufting. The density of z-fibres inserted can vary according to the expected loading pattern. On the other hand, the increase of z-properties in the dry preform is comparably low because tufting comprises no force-fit. Consequently, before consolidation, tufted preforms are not easier to handle than unreinforced ones. In fact the loops can represent an added complexity for the resin infusion process as they can complicate the consolidation of the structure.|$|E

Woven fabrics are composite orthotropic materials that respond differently under load from traditional solid mechanics.

The panels {{considered in the}} present study are composed of various combinations of resin impregnated rigid layers and unimpregnated dry woven fabric flexible plies assembled in different ways.

A numerical simulation model has been developed using non-linear finite element code LS-DYNA to predict the {{impact resistance}} of different types of composite panels subjected to low, medium and high velocity projectile impact. Shell elements have been used to model both <b>dry</b> <b>fabric</b> plies and resin impregnated composite layers. The projectile and the elasto-plastic foundation have been modelled using 3 D solid elements. The failure of the composite panels has been simulated using LS-DYNA explicit dynamics algorithm including Chang-Chang progressive damage model and Matzenmiller, Lubliner and Taylor (MLT) model for composites. The automatic surface to surface contact algorithm which allows for the sliding and separation of the <b>dry</b> <b>fabric</b> plies has been employed to model interaction between the dry layers and contact conditions between the impregnated and dry plies. Low velocity impact testing has been conducted using a drop tower impact testing rig for various levels of energy.

Woven glass fabric reinforced composite panels have been subjected to the low velocity impact and ballistic fabric (Spectra) reinforced composite panels have been tested under medium velocity impact loading. The results obtained from the numerical analysis have been validated by comparing them with the experimental data. High velocity impact simulations are performed for the hybrid flexible/rigid ply systems reinforced with ballistic fabric (Spectra) subjected to impact by deformable projectile.
