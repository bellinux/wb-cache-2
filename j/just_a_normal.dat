In an interview with CBS News' Lee Cowan in February 2014, McConaughey said that he selected the role {{because he thought it}} was not <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> story, but it was a story of a [...] "wild man." [...] McConaughey was born and raised near Dallas, so he was very familiar with the culture. Additionally, he thought that the script was [...] "incredibly human, with no sentimentality."

500|$|Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique {{gave the}} episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four, {{calling it a}} disappointment. Vitaris heavily criticized Mulder's line: [...] "I'm not a psychologist"—reportedly an ad lib from Duchovny himself—noting that it {{undermines}} established continuity within the series including the character's background in psychology. Tom Kessenich, in his 2002 book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files, praises the installment, saying, [...] "Place a devil in the plot and I'll follow you {{to see what you}} can cook up.... I enjoyed this tale of a devil looking to be <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> dad immensely."

Expressing that she was initially nervous, Bullock stated in an interview with Sky News that [...] "when everyone else acts like it's <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> day it really helps you relax." [...] Although she revealed that producers provided them with fig leaves, Bullock stated that they would continuously fall off. She added, [...] "You could literally see everything."

500|$|Krusty's {{appearance}} and design is essentially that of Homer Simpson with clown makeup. Groening said that [...] "The satirical conceit that I {{was going for}} {{at the time was}} that The Simpsons was about a kid who had no respect for his father, but worshipped a clown who looked exactly like his father", a theme which became less important as the show developed. One concept initially saw Krusty being revealed as Homer's secret identity but the idea was dropped for being too complex and because the writers were too busy developing the series. There are two instances of the one assuming the identity of the other. In a (non-canonical) Butterfinger commercial, pertaining to a contest for $50,000 to find out who stole Bart's Butterfinger, a captured Homer appears to be the culprit until Maggie pulls off a mask, revealing Krusty. [...] In the episode [...] "Homie the Clown", Homer goes to Clown College and dresses up as and is confused with Krusty. Krusty was originally <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> man wearing clown makeup, but David Silverman noted that [...] "at some point, we decided he looked [...] all the time." [...] The producers had long discussions about whether or not Krusty would always remain in his clown makeup but eventually decided that it did not matter. The writers had tried showing Krusty's real face a few times in early episodes, but decided that it did not look right, although his real face was seen in [...] "Krusty Gets Busted" [...] and [...] "Like Father, Like Clown". Later episodes made jokes about Krusty's face. In [...] "Homer's Triple Bypass", Krusty reveals that his [...] "grotesque appearance" [...] is the result of multiple heart attacks. Homer remarks that he seems fine, and Krusty replies, [...] "This ain't makeup." [...] In [...] "Bart the Fink", [...] he abandons an idea to sail away with a new identity and swims towards shore, leaving a trail of yellow makeup in his wake and his natural white face underneath. On shore, he shakes off his black hair, revealing his natural green clown hair, and removes his normal-looking fake nose to reveal his natural red bulbous clown nose underneath.|$|E
