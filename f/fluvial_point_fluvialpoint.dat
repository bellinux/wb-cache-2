Focus of the research is the floodplain of the Ganges River in the State of Bihar (India) where groundwater is the principal source of drinking water and irrigation, and where the levels of arsenic exceed the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines of 10 ?g L- 1 for safe drinking water by more than 40 times. To date, no reliable tools exist to measure the hydro-geochemical variability {{in space and time}} related to transport of dissolved arsenic in the subsurface. Shallow aquifers in the Ganges River channel belt in our study area in Bihar have high and spatially variable concentrations of arsenic contamination. The arsenic is of geogenic origin and is dissolved from fluvial sediments to groundwater by reductive release under anaerobic conditions in oxbow lakes, where the high amount of organic material acts as reagent for Fe-As-oxide dissolution. <b>Fluvial</b> <b>point</b> bars adjacent to the oxbow lakes act as stratigraphic traps for the arsenic-enriched groundwater.

40|$|AbstractIn this {{sensitivity}} analysis on a 3 D {{model of a}} heterogeneous fluvial reservoir, two scenario orders have been considered. The first one focuses on the first-order heterogeneity (i. e. a fluvial belt with a 100 % sand content), {{and the other one}} on the second-order heterogeneity accounting for the internal sedimentary fill within the fluvial belt (oxbow lakes). CO 2 injections were simulated using THOUGH 2, and the dynamic simulations show large variations of reservoir performances. The first-order heterogeneity generates a large spectrum of storage capacities ranging from 30 to 50 Mt, {{to be related to the}} natural connectivity variability between fluvial belts induced by the avulsion process. Considering second-order heterogeneity reduces the storage capacities by 30 %, highlighting the importance of representing such objects in complex heterogeneous systems. Moreover, it increases the dissolution process, increasing by the way the storage efficiency. The CO 2 plume extension and geometry is also estimated to be strongly dependent on the level of heterogeneity. Finally, trapping into poorly connected <b>fluvial</b> <b>point</b> bars affects strongly the storage capacity of the mobile CO 2 as well as the pressure field...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: A new {{technique}} is presented for generating high-resolution digital models of natural sedimentary deposits for quantitative analyses. The traditional technique of 2 D sedimentary-relief peels of unconsolidated clastic deposits {{is combined with}} modern digital laser scanning and 3 D microscopy techniques to represent spatially varying rock properties related to sedimentary fabrics at native resolution (millimeter to meter-scale). Peel topography (relief) is documented to correlate with changes in mean grain diameter and standard deviation, so that the topography {{can be used as}} a proxy (inferred) for spatially varying rock properties related to grain sizes and sorting (e. g., permeability, threshold pressure). To provide an applied example of the value of such investigation, and to illustrate the influence that sedimentary structures can have on fluid migration, peel topography is used to populate a threshold pressure 2 D continuum for invasion percolation (IP) simulations. IP is typically used for hydrocarbon migration and is being explored to investigate CO 2 migration in sequestration contexts. Simulation results for a 3. 1 -million-cell model (, 0. 5 3 0. 25 m) of a ripple-laminated peel from a modern <b>fluvial</b> <b>point</b> bar suggest that sedimentary fabrics can strongly modify saturation via local capillary trapping.

40|$|The {{parametric}} quantification of geological {{bodies from}} high-resolution seismic data helps {{to understand and}} predict their occurrences, but is often hampered by layer distortions caused by postdepositional processes. A method called GeoTime cube overcomes this by creating a seismic volume between two time-equivalent geological markers in which the vertical axis corresponds approximately to relative geologic time. This volume is no longer affected by post-depositional deformations, a feature that greatly facilitates the extraction and correct parameterisation of sedimentary bodies. A case study of a fluvio-estuarine reservoir from Suriname (Guyana coast, South America) has demonstrated how to successfully extract <b>fluvial</b> <b>point</b> bars, channel fills, and crevasse splays from the GeoTime cube. The goal of this work is to quantitatively describe these objects with a minimum number of parameters thereby using recent analogues to validate the approach. The most basic element to parameterise is the channel path, which is described with a cubic spline. The paths of the meandering rivers studied are found to show characteristic patterns, notably a relatively constant curvature of each meander loop, and a characteristic spacing of the meander loops. The main depositional products of these meandering rivers are point bars, which are caused by lateral accretion of sand on the inner banks of the evolving meander loops.

40|$|Sedimentological and {{architectural}} data from three-dimensional larger vertical outcrops of Pleistocene fluvial deposits of the Dandiero Basin (Eritrean Danakil depression) are here used to reconstruct planform {{evolution of a}} meander bend and investigate the role of overbank flooding in sediment distribution on point bars. The point bar accumulated {{as part of a}} lowstand systems tract at the base of an incised valley cut into lacustrine mud. Selected outcrops transect a 1 -km-long channel belt exposed parallel to the main fluvial transport direction. Sedimentological logs, outcrop line drawings, and paleocurrent and bedding measurements show that this outcrop belt represents a transverse section of an asymmetric <b>fluvial</b> <b>point</b> bar, which accumulated through migration of a channel 6 m deep and 70 m wide. This bar was characterized by early expansion followed by downstream accretion, which was abruptly interrupted by lacustrine deposition. The onset of downstream accretion started when the channel expanded to reach the more resistant valley wall. Sediment accreted on the downstream side of the point bar and accumulated both during bankfull discharge and overbank floods, with significant modification of the channel flow where the floodwater re-entered the main channel (i. e., riffle zone). In this zone, a secondary circulation cell triggered a shift of erosion toward the inner bank and scrolling on the downstream side of the point bar...|$|R
40|$|During the Early Miocene, {{coincident}} {{with the}} Sardinia-Corsica block rotation, mixed carbonate-siliciclastic sediments of the Cala di Labra Formation were deposited {{on the southern}} margin of the Bonifacio Basin (southeastern Corsica, France). The Burdigalian marine transgression is spectacularly represented by a peculiar coral bioconstruction, unconformably lying on the eroded Variscan granitic basement. Superb exposures allowed detailed, three-dimensional field mapping, lithofacies analysis, and characterization of the Cala di Labra coral bioconstruction. As {{a result of the}} extremely irregular and articulated substrate, the coral buildup appears as an organized lens-shaped structure, and its core is constituted by a relatively dense coral domestone with a moderate increase of platy corals in the upper part. A coral rubble associated with granitic cobbles and pebbles is locally present at the base. The inter-coral sediment consists of poorly sorted bioclastic wackestone to packstone. Results from this study clearly show evidence for the occurrence of a former submerged granitic substrate that, as very rarely documented in the geological record, is here interpreted as the subtidal substrate for growth of a small bioconstruction under relatively high energy and clear water conditions. The Cala di Labra bioconstruction is overlain by a fining-upward quartzose conglomerate and sandstone succession interpreted as deposited in a coastal setting near <b>fluvial</b> <b>point</b> sources.

40|$|The {{connectivity}} between SAGD pair-wells {{is the key}} {{for success}} of SAGD processes. The bituminous sands of Corner field situate in middle McMurray, where tidal influenced meandering <b>fluvial</b> <b>point</b> bar dominate the deposits. Thus, to characterize the internal structure of point bar deposit is essential to optimize SAGD production in Corner field. The aim of this thesis is to investigate correspondences between point bar internal structures and VSP responses. Since VSP preserve higher frequency than surface seismic thus VSP data would provide more precise identification and characterization of internal structures if we can recognize them from data. These investigations are done by comparing actual data, synthetic data and targets part in the model. Prior to the comparisons, {{we need to build}} a model that preserves the characteristics of our targets in subsurface as accurate as possible. We decompose the segment of logging data corresponding to the thickness of point bar deposits into a function which is able to represent the influence of gravity on deposition and a function that is able to imply the affect of current. After examining relation between borehole and inclined units of point bar structure, two scaled functions are combined in a way which can produce structures of point bar deposits. As soon as a realistic model is constructed, VSP simulations proceed. Based on the comparison of plane wave source VSP data with the model, it is found that variation of travel-time difference between two levels indicate heterogeneities between these levels. Since finite difference used in this thesis is based on acoustic wave propagation, only travel-time is investigated. While if an elastic modeling is available, the results will be more fruitful with respect to amplitudes variation and wave conversion.

The application of lithostratigraphic approach led to correlation of diachronous lithofacies and wrongly defined an approximately accurate extent of the reservoirs. This study necessitated the use of sequence stratigraphic framework {{for the purpose of}} establishing chronostratigraphic concept and facies prediction. The genetic sequence model of Galloway was adopted for sequence stratigraphic interpretation of the field. The structural style is dominated by closely spaced simple rollover anticline bounded by growth faults, and this includes down-to-basin listric faults, collapsed crest structures, antithetic and synthetic faults. Result of foraminifera analysis showed that the analyzed interval is very rich in calcareous benthic but decreased in planktic and arenaceous benthic foraminifera. Lithofacies analysis shows that the continental lithofacies is made up of dominantly sand with thin bands of shales, while Agbada lithofacies is made up of alternating intervals of sandstones and shales to very thick shale unit in the lower section. The facies identified using log motifs and their stacking patterns include braided fluvial, crevasse splay, <b>fluvial</b> <b>point</b> bar, distributary/tidal channels, intertidal, subtidal and storm-dominated shelf facies. The presence of water depth indicator fossils confirmed the water depths of coastal deltaic, shallow inner neritic, inner neritic, middle neritic and outer neritic were based largely on the presence of environmentally restricted benthic foraminifera species. Integration of lithofacies and biofacies data suggests depositional environments ranging from coastal deltaic to outer neritic environment. Sequence stratigraphic analysis identified three complete sequences with accompanying system tracts over the interval 7922.3 – 14, 856.34  ft. The transgressive system tracts (TSTs) within these sequences are dominated by marine shales and thin sands. Reservoir quality sands are found in highstand system tract and shelfal lowstand system tract, while the shales of TSTs and HSTs form potential source and seal units. The delineation and correlation of sequence stratigraphic surfaces enable us to build an approximate chronostratigraphic framework, which is essential for determining facies relationships. Reacquisition and/or processing should be done to improve seismic data quality for better imaging and interpretation/mapping, especially hydrocarbon prospect at deeper horizon.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{supposition}} {{that the}} Late Devonian Gondwanan glaciation should be recorded in more temperate regions by black shales, incised valleys, and lowstand wedges is tested {{with reference to}} the Foreknobs Formation (late Frasnian to early Famennian) of the central Appalachian Basin (USA). The upper (early Famennian) portion of the Foreknobs Formation in a proximal strike belt in eastern West Virginia contains an erosionally based, coarse, conglomeratic, incised valley fill (IVF) that is underlain and overlain by strata deposited in a relatively deep-marine, ramp setting. A signal of sea-level drawdown {{is in the form of}} conglomeratic, hummocky cross-stratified (HCS) storm event beds underlying the IVF, suggesting the proximity of a gravely <b>fluvial</b> <b>point</b> source up-paleoslope. Within a more distal outcrop 66 km (41 miles) to the west, and at about the same stratigraphic horizon, the Foreknobs Formation exhibits a relatively thin succession of black shale that was deposited as sea-level fell, resulting in the concentration of nutrients that caused anoxic conditions. Overlying the black shale are several erosionally based lowstand wedge deposits comprised of cyclic conglomeratic, braided-stream facies which fine-upward to dark gray shales deposited within estuarine environments. The genetically related proximal IVF and the lowermost distal lowstand wedge formed during a major 3 rd-order eustatic sea-level fall (35 – 45 m) consistent with published 3 rd-order sea-level curves. Lowering of sea-level (base-level) resulted in steeper stream gradients which caused incision and transportation of gravel from the wedge-top depozone of the foreland basin down to the basinward-migrated shoreline. Inferred depositional environments of the distal lowstand wedge are consistent with interpretations from regional subsurface mapping west of the most distal outcrop belt. From inferred magnitudes of sea-level falls and the physics of ice-sheets, calculations of areal extents of ice over Gondwana suggest that an early Famennian inferred sea-level fall of 35 – 45 m translates to an area of ice which is only half of the reported area of late Famennian ice. The data are consistent with step-wise increases in magnitude of sea-level fluctuations during deposition of the Upper Devonian Foreknobs Formation within a period of time transitional between Middle Devonian greenhouse conditions and the later icehouse conditions of the Late Paleozoic...|$|R
40|$|Sources {{of ancient}} {{volcanic}} rocks are often unknown {{if they are}} either eroded and/or covered by younger deposits. This problem, {{as well as the}} provenance of reworked volcaniclastic, fluvial and mass-flow deposits, can be partially solved by the application of anisotropy of the magnetic susceptibility (AMS). For massive and poorly sorted volcaniclastic rocks in particular this may be the only way of finding reliable transport directions and therefore allowing for paleogeographic reconstructions. Here, we present a data set of 428 AMS measurements and 249 measurements of sedimentary paleocurrent indicators from the Miocene Tepoztlán Formation at the southern edge of the Transmexican Volcanic Belt (Central Mexico). The highest degree of reliability of AMS measurements is gained for data from lava samples and the lowest from mass flows. Sedimentary structures in sandstones and conglomerates such as trough cross-stratification, asymmetric ripple marks, and the shape of scours and channels could be used to calibrate the results from AMS data and to prove their reliability.

The sedimentation phases are in agreement with known episodes of increased population density, which suggests active use of the pesqueiras.

This timing coincides with the transition of the NW Iberian landscape towards a more intensively used agricultural landscape, as evidenced from other geo-archeological investigations. The results demonstrate that the pesqueiras are several hundreds of years older than known from historical records, but not so old as to date back to the Roman occupation...|$|R
40|$|The {{major goal}} {{of this paper is}} to {{determine}} the depositional environment of the lowermost unit of the Eagle Formation (commonly referred to as the Virgelle Sandstone) in North-Central Wyoming. Although this rock unit has been studied in surrounding areas (particularly Montana, Shelton, 1965) the results of those studies have not been validated in the vicinity of the Elk Basin oil field. Thus, further research into the origin of the Virgelle Sandstone is needed to determine whether or not its depositional environment is the same throughout the Northern Rockies. To determine the depositional environment of the Virgelle Sandstone, an analysis of the lithologies and an interpretation of the overall stratigraphy are important. The lithologic characteristics can indicate the source of the transported sediments, the flow regime associated with such transportation, and the environment in which the sediments were deposited (e. g. <b>fluvial</b> plain, <b>point</b> bar deposits). The overall stratigraphy of the area is important in order to gain a regional perspective of the paleoecologic conditions of the time, as well as any geologic disturbances and/or fluctuations that may have occurred (i. e. transgressions, regressions, local tectonism, etc [...] ).

40|$|In fluvial {{dynamics}} studies, {{different methods}} {{are used to}} evaluate bedload transport and particle travel lengths. However, results are mostly based on a few transported elements and on {{a relatively short time}} scale. Consequently, it is difficult to extrapolate these results to whole bedload, because of the burying of particles into the subsurface layer or the trapping of elements in <b>fluvial</b> forms (<b>point</b> bars, riffles, …), which can immobilise elements during long periods. Bedload progression has been evaluated in Ardenne rivers using slag elements produced by the past factories established along rivers between the 14 th and the 19 th centuries. Important quantities of slag were dumped close to rivers or even directly into channels. For several centuries, slag elements were dispersed in the bedload and transported by floods of varying importance. Consequently, slag can be considered as a tracer to analyze bedload progression over several centuries. The size of slag elements has been studied in many Ardenne rivers. The longitudinal size trend of the largest slag particles allows us to determine the effective competence of rivers and to analyze the hydraulic sorting. Moreover, downstream of some metallurgic sites, we have constrained the presence of slag elements to the most downstream riffles. Because we know from historical studies the periods of activities of these sites, we may estimate the speed of bedload progression in several gravel bed rivers from the Ardenne Massif (2 - 3 km/century).

40|$|Exposures of {{the lower}} Waterford Formation, Karoo Basin, South Africa provide rare {{three-dimensional}} control to an exhumed low-gradient basin margin, which permits increased understanding of sub-seismic scale process-regime and lateral variability. The study section overlies a 500 -m-thick channelized submarine slope succession and is subdivided into eight mappable parasequences clinothems. The central 40 km 2 D reference profile parallel to depositional dip (i. e. west-to-east) enables characterization of the shelf-to-slope transition for two successive clinothems {{and the establishment of}} robust criteria for identifying the shelf edge at outcrop. The two clinothems exhibit differing process responses to the gradient increase at the shelf edge rollover. The fluvial-dominated, mouth-bar clinothem of WfC 3 exhibits a 5 km dip-parallel zone of extensional growth faulting at the shelf edge with limited delivery of sediment beyond the shelf edge rollover. In contrast, WfC 4 is a wave and storm dominated shoreface-clinothem that supplied a thick upper slope turbidite succession via closely spaced gullies at the shelf edge and a large upper slope channel. This suggests that the delivery of sediment to deep-water settings is governed by parameters other than the presence and proximity of a <b>fluvial</b> <b>point</b> source, which is heavily advocated in current models for shelf construction. It would be common practice to attribute variability between successive clinothems on a single 2 D dip profile to lateral variability across the basin margin. However, two additional, sub-parallel dip profiles across depositional strike to the north and south of the reference profile indicate significant 3 D variability {{in the nature of the}} clinothems. A greater supply of sediment to the upper slope in the north of the region, in the absence of a clear fluvial driver, suggests that the deltaic/shoreface system was able to transit quickly to the shelf edge and establish itself in that position for an extended period. Increasing parasequence thickness toward the north indicates greater accommodation in this area throughout the lower Waterford succession. It is therefore likely that differential subsidence across the margin controlled the position of the shelf edge and maintained a narrower shelf in the north, which would have had significant influence on sediment routing paths, diverting them to the north. Abundant shelf-confined soft sediment deformation in successive clinothems along all three dip margin profiles is attributed to instability on the frontal slopes of inner shelf deltas, due to high rates of sediment supply. The basinward splitting and abrupt thinning of deformed packages beyond the inferred shelf edge rollover shows that the presence of soft-sediment deformation alone is not an adequate criterion with which to define the shelf edge rollover. The significant thickness of shelf deposits without subaerial exposure indicates that the margin was subject to a relatively high subsidence rate but that the rate of sediment supply was sufficient to drive the system to the shelf edge and deliver sand to the slope without the development of incised valleys. Therefore, the lower Waterford Formation is considered a high accommodation / high supply system. This study provides a high-resolution outcrop-based dataset with three-dimensional constraints. It enables greater understanding of the controls on basin margin construction, and the sub-seismic scale processes that control the spatial and temporal variability of sediment delivery to the slope and basin floor...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{scarcity}} of stratigraphic data has hindered the demarcation of the outcropping area of Miocene deposits of the Amazon Basin, represented informally by the Novo Remanso Formation. Moreover, this unit {{is characterized by}} a sparse and irregular geographic distribution due to its sedimentological features and rare fossil content. Miocene deposits cropping out in central Amazonas Basin area were described in sedimentological terms and analyzed palynologically. All analyses were undertaken in samples collected at the Uatumã River banks (Itapiranga and São Sebastião do Uatumã cities). Lithostratigraphic data shows that Novo Remanso Formation consists of sandstones, with subordinate conglomerates and pelites, characteristic of a meandering fluvial paleosystem, with <b>fluvial</b> channel, <b>point</b> bar, floodplain and crevasse splay facies. The palynoflora retrieved from five samples consists exclusively of continental-origin palynomorphs dominated by angiosperms species. Trilete spores are well represented, while gymnosperms pollen grains are minor components. The presence of Psilastephanoporites tesseroporus, Syncolporites poricostatus, Jandufouria seamrogiformis and Polypodiaceoisporites potoniei ensure these deposits fits into the Grimsdalea magnaclavata palynozone (Regali et al. 1974 a, b), and the Grimsdalea magnaclavata/Crassoretitriletes vanraadshooveni palynozones of Jaramillo et al.

40|$|Ancient coastal–shallow marine {{sedimentary}} rocks preserve a fragmented history of competing tidal, wave, storm and fluvial processes {{and changes in}} sedimentary environments, including the influence of variations in sea level, tectonics, climate and ocean circulation. To unravel these records, this study integrates detailed sedimentary analysis of outcrop and sub-surface data, palaeogeographic and palaeotectonic reconstructions, palaeo-ocean modelling and process-based analysis of modern depositional systems. This approach {{was applied to the}} Miocene–Modern Baram Delta Province (BDP), which is one of several peripheral basins around the South China Sea (SCS). Here, the ancient and modern systems are intimately linked through close similarities in climate (humid-tropical), tectonic setting (active margin) and sedimentary environments. The main focus was on shoreline environments, which comprise two main groups: (1) mixed-process, wave-dominated, fluvial- and tide-influenced shelf to shelf-edge deltas/shorelines, and (2) coastal embayments with similar mixed-process bayhead deltas, shorelines and estuaries. The principal controls on ancient stratigraphic preservation and architecture along this active tectonic margin were (1) drainage basin switching, (2) high rates of sedimentation and accommodation space, and (3) a coastal-deltaic plain with multiple <b>fluvial</b> entry <b>points.</b> The controls on tidal processes and preservation of tidal deposits, including ancient mangroves, are investigated for the Oligocene–Miocene around the SCS.

A spatial analysis of the biogeomorphologic succession was undertaken considering effects of flood regime. Interactions between vegetation dynamics and flood events largely controlled the spontaneous replacement of the dense riparian forest removed in October 1940 during an exceptional high magnitude flood event with a recurrence time ! 100 yr. In response to this major disturbance event, the fluvial landscape demonstrated a very high resilience emphasizing the existence of a positive feedback driven by pioneer riparian vegetation. The observed feedback corresponded to landform accretion, vegetation succession and to an increase of biogeomorphologic stability under current hydrogeomorphologic and bioclimatic conditions. The evolution of the biogeomorphologic system toward stabilisation appeared to be non-linear with a threshold occurring thirty years after the exceptional destructive flood event. This threshold materialized a reinforcement of biogeomorphologic cohesive forces driven by vegetation dynamics.

These provided the age-elating and subdivision of a post-Cietaceous stratigraphic succession in the Amazonas Basin. The Novo Remanso Formation is subdivided into upper and lower units, and delineated by discontinuous surfaces at its top and bottom. The formation consists primarily of sandstones and minor mudstones and conglomerates, reflecting <b>fluvial</b> channel, <b>point</b> bar and floodplain facies of a fluvial meandering paleosystem. Fairly well-preserved palynoflora was recovered from four palynologically productive samples collected in a local irregular concentration of gray clay deposits, rich in organic material and fossilized wood, {{at the top of}} the Nova Remanso Formation upper unit. The palynoflora is dominated by terrestrial spores and pollen grains, an d is characterized by abundant angiosperm pollen grains (Tricolpites, Grimsdalea, Perisyncolporites, Tricolporites and Malvacearumpollis). Trilete spores are almost as abundant as the angiosperm pollen, and are represented mainly by the genera Deltoidospora. Verrutriletes, and Hamulatisporis. Gymnosperm pollen is scarce. The presence of the index species Grimsdalea magnaclavata Germeraad et al. (1968) indicates that these deposits belong to the Middle Miocene homonymous palynozone (Lorente, 1986; Hoorn, 1993; Jaramillo et al., 2011). Sedimentological characteristics (poorly sorted, angular to sub-angular, fine to very-coarse quartz sands facies) are typical of the NOW Remanso Formation upper part. These are associated with a paleoflow to the NE-E and SE-E, and with a a entirely lowland-derived palinofloristic content with no Andean ferns and gymnosperms representatives. All together, this suggests a cratonic origin for this Middle Miocene fluvial paleosystem, which was probably born in the Purus Arch eastern flank and areas surrounding the crystalline. The palynological analysis results presented herein are the first direct and unequivocal evidence of the occurrence of Middle Miocene deposits in the central part of the Amazonas Basin. They also provide new perspectives for intra- and interbasin correlations, as well as paleogeographic and paleoenvironmental interpretations for the later deposition stages in the northern Brazilian sedimentary basins.

Both historical and geographical constraints account for the location of the Roman town of Suasa atop a Pleistocene terrace {{on the right side of}} Cesano River. As for man-environment interaction, it is worlh stressing that through the V-W centuries a. D. a marked climatic cooling triggered an aggradation pattern in the river valley whose effectiveness was boosted because the population drop was obviously paralleled by a progressive abandonment of agriculture as well as by hydraulic workings...|$|R

Plate 1 : Geologic map of {{the study}} area showing {{locations}} of major geographic features, measured stratigraphic sections, paleocurrent data measuring stations, and structural features Plate 2 : East-west profile through sandstones C and D at measured sections 37 through 45 showing architectural elements identifiedUp to 600 m (1970 ft) of non-marine Williams Fork Formation sedimentary rocks are exposed along the north-south trending Douglas Creek arch on {{the western edge of the}} Piceance Creek basin near Rangely, Colorado. Williams Fork deposits conformably overlie deltaic Iles Formation strata and are unconformably overlain by Eocene Wasatch Formation fluvio-lacustrine deposits. Williams Fork and lIes strata are interpreted to represent a prograding clastic wedge that advanced east-ward from the late Jurassic to early Late Cretaceous Sevier orogenic front, and onto the western shore of the Western Interior Seaway. An interval of Williams Fork deposits about 250 m thick (820 ft) that contains nine major sandstone bodies was studied. 	Sedimentary lithofacies recognized include sandstone, interlayered siltstone and mudstone, gray-brown claystone, and carbonaceous shale and coal. Sandstones have erosional bases, and are up to 1200 m wide (3370 ft) and 20 m thick (63 ft). Basal lag deposits include mudstone and siltstone rip-up clasts, bone fragments, and silicified logs. Sandstone beds are composed of very fine-to medium-size grains and show fining-upward trends. Sedimentary structures include large-scale trough cross beds, micro-trough cross laminations, horizontal laminae, and convolute bedding. Sedimentary structures decrease in size upward through sandstone intervals. Sandstone deposits are interpreted as <b>fluvial</b> channel, <b>point</b> bar, and crevasse splay deposits. 	Interbedded siltstone and mudstone deposits showing syndepositional dips of 5 ?? to 10 ?? are interpreted as lateral-accretion bedding, whereas similar deposits that are approximately horizontal are interpreted as flood deposits laid down proximal to active channels. Gray-brown claystone beds are also interpreted as flood deposits, based on their lateral extents, sharp bases, and horizontal nature. Carbonaceous shale and coal beds, and associated sandy lenses containing abundant snail shell casts, are interpreted as swamp and pond deposits. 	Paleocurrent directions from nine major sandstone trends were measured on trough axes, trough cross beds, parting lineations, flute casts, and ripple marks. Paleocurrent data show a shift in paleoslope direction upsection, with highly variable flow trends toward the southeast in the lower part of the section, and distinct flow trends toward the northeast in the upper part of the section. This is similar to the trend reported from Williams Fork-equivalent strata exposed on the east side of the Piceance Creek basin. There, the shift has been associated with the Laramide orogeny. This suggests that a reorientation in the paleoslope toward the northeast may have been synchronous throughout the Piceance Creek basin area. 	Thin sections studied show Williams Fork sandstones to be moderately sorted, subangular to subrounded chert and argillite litharenites, with argillaceous matrices, calcareous cements, and low porosities (1...|$|R
40|$|Coastal {{phytoplankton}} blooms {{can result}} from upwelling of colder nutrient-rich water, seasonal <b>fluvial</b> or anthropogenic <b>point</b> sources of nutrient. Here we analyze 15 -year time series of monthly mean and 8 -day satellite-derived chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and sea surface temperature (SST) on the southern Queensland continental shelf (24. 25 – 28. 25 °S) from March 2000 to February 2015. We examine the interannual variability in these parameters {{and its relationship to}} algal bloom dynamics. Seasonal climatological means are computed and analyzed. Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis is applied to these time series. Cross-correlation and spatial correlation analyses are used to investigate the relationship between the multivariate ENSO index (MEI), Chl-a and SST. Computed eigenvectors of the time series of Chl-a and SST present a strong seasonal variability on the first EOF modes. Thus, the seasonal variability was removed by computing monthly and 8 -day Chl-a and SST anomalies. The EOF analysis was then applied to the anomaly time series. Correlation analysis results show a positive correlation between MEI and the eigenvector of the first EOF of the monthly Chl-a anomaly with time lag of three to four months. We find a negative correlation between MEI and the eigenvector of the second EOF of the monthly Chl-a anomaly with time lag of three to four months. There is no correlation between MEI and eigenvectors of the monthly SST anomaly. There are significant correlations between eigenvectors of the first and second EOF modes of 8 -day Chl-a and the first and second EOF modes of 8 -day SST respectively. Negative correlation coefficients between 8 -day anomalies of Chl-a and SST are found on the continental shelf to the east of Fraser Island and Stradbroke Island. Analysis of a particular algal bloom event indicates a negative SST anomaly and negative curl of wind stress in the waters to the southeast of Fraser Island suggesting that wind stress is possibly a secondary but significant physical driver of the upwelling system. Our results suggest that variability in phytoplankton biomass on the southern Queensland continental shelf is driven by upwelling of nutrients during the spring dry season and fluvial nutrient loads during the summer and autumn wet seasons. Seasonal change is the primary factor controlling the variability of Chl-a and SST while climate variability (ENSO) and upwelling are secondary but significant factors.

40|$|International audienceSinuous deep-water {{channels}} are recognized in most large deep-sea {{fans in the}} world. They present a particular interest to oil companies, since they are significant hydrocarbon reservoirs in deep offshore environments. The understanding of their geometries and their internal sedimentary architecture is necessary to better characterize reservoir heterogeneity of sinuous submarine channels. Therefore, numerous studies have been undertaken recently {{to better understand the}} behavior and sedimentary architecture of deep-water channels. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present our results concerning the development of the meandering channel of the present Congo turbidite system (or Zaire turbidite system). The study is based on high-resolution data including multibeam bathymetry, seismic lines, echosounder profiles, high-resolution side-scan sonar images, and gravity cores, collected by IFREMER along the submarine Congo channel between 1994 and 2000, during Guiness and ZaiAngo surveys. The present Congo turbidite channel is a long incised turbidite channel. It is presently active. It has been built gradually by progradation of the distal depositional area. The most distal part of the channel is the youngest part and shows an immature morphology: the channel presents a low incision and a low sinuosity. In contrast, the upper part of the channel has undergone a long evolutionary history. Its pathway is mature and complex, with numerous abandoned meanders visible in the morphology. This paper presents evidence of progressive channel migration and meander development of the Congo channel. It describes and explains the presence of terraces inside the channel. The detailed characterization of channel morphology and migration geometry shows that the evolution of the channel path is very similar to fluvial meandering systems with (1) lateral meander extension or growing, (2) downstream translation of the thalweg, and (3) meander cutoff. Seismic and 3. 5 kHz echosounder profiles show that the terraces, which are visible in the seafloor morphology, are not the imprints of incisional processes. Terraces are true depositional units infilling the channel. They are built during and after the lateral migration of the channel. They are composed of (1) point-bar deposits and (2) inner-levee deposits aggrading above the point bar deposits. Point-bar deposits are characterized by low-angle oblique reflectors forming deposits with a sigmoidal shape. They seem very similar to those observed in fluvial systems. The similarity between <b>fluvial</b> and turbidite <b>point</b> bars suggests that the basal part of the turbidity currents flowing in this channel can be considered as very similar to river flow. With the high-resolution dataset collected in a present Congo turbidite channel, we provide a new description of the channel morphology and evolution, at a "reservoir" scale, intermediate between outcrop observations and 2 D and 3 D seismic data. The detailed interpretation of intrachannel sedimentation, associated with lateral channel migration, also provides new data for interpretation of flow dynamics in submarine meandering channels...|$|R
