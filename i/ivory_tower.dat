25|$|Green's 2000 book, , {{had a deep}} {{impact in}} the {{academic}} history community. The book is a semi-autobiographical account of the role historical awareness plays in forging powerful, effective social movements. Writing in a colloquial style, Green discussed how important historical {{events such as the}} Haymarket riot, the Bread and Roses strike, and the civil rights movement influenced his own life. He vividly describes these events, and ended up not only writing popular historical narratives but showed how those stories encouraged his own participation in various causes. In many ways, the book is a written example of Green's lifelong struggle to take history out of the <b>ivory</b> <b>tower</b> and make it come alive and be relevant to working people and community activists. The book received praise from academics for encouraging the reconnection of academia to society.|$|E
