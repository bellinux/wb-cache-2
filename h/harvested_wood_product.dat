By using the classification definition of the <b>harvested</b> <b>wood</b> <b>product</b> of FAO, the wood product groups were reclassified and estimated, including roundwood, sawnwood, wood based panels and pulp wood and wood chips. According to solid wood equivalent volume, the total wood material demand and consumption were estimated. In 2011, wood product demand is 5. 29 million m^ 3, the consumption is 5. 20 million m^ 3. However, the wood self-sufficiency rate is only 0. 45 %. The demand difference between solid wood equivalent volume and round wood equivalent volume is 3. 29 million m^ 3. 本研究之目的為分析台灣地區木質材料需求量之現況及其使用型態。本研究採用聯合國農糧署（FAO）所定義的伐後木質產品（Harvested Wood Product，HWP）分類方式，以材積當量為基礎，重新估算台灣地區木質材料包含原木、製材、木質人造板類及木漿材、木片之需求量與消費量，並比較原木當量與材積當量之差異，以提供政策制定、學術研究及林產品碳吸存量計算所需之參考。 2011 年木質材料需求量約為 529 萬m^ 3,消費量約為 520 萬m^ 3 ，木材自給率為 0. 45 %； 2011 年原木當量與材積當量之材積相差 329 萬m^ 3...|$|E

In the current accounting system, emissions of CO 2 from <b>harvested</b> <b>wood</b> <b>products</b> (HWP) are attributed to {{the year of harvest}} and the country of <b>harvest.</b> All <b>harvested</b> <b>wood</b> is thus assumed to be oxidised to CO 2 in the year of <b>harvesting,</b> and no <b>wood</b> goes into long term storage. This is called the IPCC default approach. Much of the <b>harvested</b> <b>wood</b> will however be stored for a short or long period of time before it oxidises and this will cause a delayed emission of CO 2. If more wood is stored than oxidised in a given year, <b>harvested</b> <b>wood</b> <b>products</b> will act as a sink and a removal of CO 2 is recorded.

The final outcome of this exercise is called the product‟s „carbon footprint ‟ and the exercise itself is known as „carbon accounting‟. Carbon footprints are expressed in units of CO 2 equivalents (CO 2 e).

40|$|Forest {{carbon cycle}} {{consists}} of biological and industrial cycles, whose carbon budget and carbon stock change should be estimated. The complete forest carbon budget was seldom reported in China, and carbon budget was mainly {{used to calculate}} forest biological carbon stock change. Therefore, we analyzed and presented the complete forest carbon cycle by dividing it into three carbon pools: pre-harvest forest, <b>harvested</b> <b>wood</b> <b>product</b> (HWP) manufacturing, and HWP use and disposal. Then, the carbon budget and net carbon flux of each pool during 1999 - 2008 were calculated using forest inventory data, HWP production and consumption, and economic data. The results showed that about 1334. 46 and 1423. 84 TgC carbon were sequestered from atmosphere in 1999 - 2003 and 2004 - 2008, respectively. The two periods had forest ecosystem net carbon flux of 1356. 29 and 1442. 90 TgC, adding up to 2799. 19 TgC. For the industrial part, 112. 14 Tg carbon was stored in new HWP, but 40. 86 Tg more carbon was released from HWP production, use and disposal. We went onto compare the carbon budgets of 1999 - 2003 and 2004 - 2008, {{and found out that}} net sequestered carbon was 89. 38 TgC higher in the latter period, 86. 61 TgC more stored in forest ecosystem and 2. 77 TgC less released from the industrial carbon cycle.

The choice of paper mills for both cover and page papers was based on criteria such as percentage of recycled content in the pulp mix, transport distances (pulp mill to paper mill, paper mill to print), and technologies. The cradle-to-gate assessment of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions follows recognized guidelines for carbon footprint assessment. The {{results show that the}} production of 400, 000 books, mainly distributed in North America, would generate 1, 084 tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 -eq), or 2. 71 kilograms (kg) CO 2 -eq per book. The impact of using deinked market pulp (DMP) is shown here to be detrimental, accounting for 54 % of total GHG emissions and being 32 % higher than reference virgin Kraft pulp. This supports findings that DMP mill GHG emissions strongly correlate with the carbon intensity of the power grid supplying the pulp mill and that virgin Kraft mills that reuse wood residue and black liquor to produce heat and electricity can achieve lower GHG emissions per tonne of pulp produced.

Our research (1) describes the impact of harvesting frequency and degree of post- harvest structural retention on carbon storage in northern hardwood-conifer forests, and (2) tests the significance of including <b>harvested</b> <b>wood</b> <b>products</b> in carbon accounting at the stand scale. We stratified Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) plots to control for environmental, forest structural and compositional variables, resulting in 32 FIA plots distributed throughout the northeastern U. S. We used the USDA Forest Vegetation Simulator to project stand development over a 160 year period under nine different forest management scenarios. Simulated treatments represented a gradient of increasing structural retention and decreasing harvesting frequencies and included a “no harvest” scenario. The simulations incorporated carbon flux between aboveground forest biomass (dead and live pools) and <b>harvested</b> <b>wood</b> <b>products</b> (including carbon storage in landfills). Mean carbon storage over the simulation period, including carbon stored in <b>harvested</b> <b>wood</b> <b>products,</b> was calculated for each silvicultural scenario.

40|$|The {{potential}} of forests {{and the forest}} sector to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is widely recognized, but challenging to quantify at a national scale. Forests and their carbon (C) sequestration potential are affected by management practices, where wood harvesting transfers C {{out of the forest}} into products, and subsequent regrowth allows further C sequestration. Here we determine the mitigation {{potential of}} the 2. 3 × 10 6 km 2 of Canada's managed forests from 2015 to 2050 using the Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest Sector (CBM-CFS 3), a harvested wood products (HWP) model that estimates emissions based on product half-life decay times, and an account of emission substitution benefits from the use of wood products and bioenergy. We examine several mitigation scenarios with different assumptions about forest management activity levels relative to a base case scenario, including improved growth from silvicultural activities, increased harvest and residue management for bioenergy, and reduced harvest for conservation. We combine forest management options with two mitigation scenarios for <b>harvested</b> <b>wood</b> <b>product</b> use involving an increase in either long-lived products or bioenergy uses. Results demonstrate large differences among alternative scenarios, and we identify potential mitigation scenarios with increasing benefits to the atmosphere for many decades into the future, as well as scenarios with no net benefit over many decades. The greatest mitigation impact was achieved through a mix of strategies that varied across the country and had cumulative mitigation of 254 Tg CO 2 e in 2030, and 1180 Tg CO 2 e in 2050. There was a trade-off between short-term and long-term goals, in that maximizing short-term emissions reduction could reduce the forest sector's ability to contribute to longer-term objectives. We conclude that (i) national-scale forest sector mitigation options need to be assessed rigorously from a systems perspective to avoid the development of policies that deliver no net benefits to the atmosphere, (ii) a mix of strategies implemented across the country achieves the greatest mitigation impact, and (iii) because of the time delays in achieving carbon benefits for many forest-based mitigation activities, future contributions of the forest sector to climate mitigation can be maximized if implemented soon...|$|E
40|$|From energy outlooks, {{it becomes}} clear that global {{bioenergy}} consumption is expected to grow further; specifically the demand for wood for electricity and heating, together with agricultural biomass for liquid biofuels. The EU has an ambitious and integrated policy in order to address climate change and security of energy supply towards 2020. Proposed policies with more stringent goals for the 2030 horizon are: 40 % greenhouse gas emission (GHG) reduction, and further increase of Renewable Energy Sources (RES). Further mobilisation of wood within the EU- 28 and supplementary supplies from North American and Russian forests could help to fulfil EU’s 2020 - 2030 policies. Specifically for external supplies, the import of wood pellets from outside the EU is expected to significantly contribute to EU’s future demand. Based on existing knowledge gaps and the reach of EU’s policies, three research questions are addressed: How can the supply of wood pellets and other woody biomass be guaranteed in a sustainable way, following the EU legislation on legal sourcing, sustainable biomass production and efficient re-use of wood wastes (cascading) ?Worldwide, a large share of the managed (production) forest area is currently not certified. A risk based approach is used by suppliers to comply with legal sourcing requirements, together with forest certification. This approach may lead to insufficient coverage of sustainability criteria. Obviously, a maximum ceiling for risk based fibers is needed, also to encourage the use of fibers from certified forests. Although technically possible, waste wood is not yet mixed with forest fibers for wood pellet production. Trade seems restricted due to unclear rules in the EU Waste Directive. What are the current and future woody biomass demand & supply market expectations due to-EU’s future policies? Future demand and supply of woody biomass need more attention. Wood shortages are expected from 2020 and beyond, based on current forest management and consumption patterns for virgin wood fibres and recycled wood. Future efforts on wood mobilisation should focus on the introduction of state-of-the-art Scandinavian style forest management methods in other EU Member states and the support for recycling of post-consumer wood waste fibres. What is the GHG emission reduction potential of using woody biomass for power and heat (by replacing fossil fuels) in comparison with using harvested wood products for traditional wood and paper products (e. g. construction wood instead of steel and concrete) ? Based on EU’s future growth in woody biomass needs for energy (77 million tonnes per annum) and elaborated <b>harvested</b> <b>wood</b> <b>product</b> (HWP) scenarios, total annual GHG savings in the EU by producing wood pellets to replace coal may amount in 105 million tonnes CO 2 eq, which is 9. 4 % of the EU’s absolute reduction goal in 2020. In an optimum savings scenario, harvested wood from high quality trees should be first used for sawn wood, followed by recycling and combustion (cascading), whereas low quality logs can be immediately used for pellets and energy.

This {{makes it difficult}} to assess the greenhouse gas (GHG) consequences of different forest management or manufacturing activities that maintain the storage of carbon. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) addresses this issue by allowing other accounting methods. The objective {{of this paper is to}} provide a new model for estimating annual stock changes of carbon in <b>harvested</b> <b>wood</b> <b>products</b> (HWP). Results The model, British Columbia <b>Harvested</b> <b>Wood</b> <b>Products</b> version 1 (BC-HWPv 1), estimates carbon stocks and fluxes for <b>wood</b> <b>harvested</b> in BC from 1965 to 2065, based on new parameters on local manufacturing, updated and new information for North America on consumption and disposal of <b>wood</b> and paper <b>products,</b> and updated parameters on methane management at landfills in the USA. Based on model results, reporting on emissions as they occur would substantially lower BC’s greenhouse gas inventory in 2010 from 48 Mt CO 2 to 26 Mt CO 2 because of the long-term forest carbon storage in-use and in the non-degradable material in landfills. In addition, if offset projects created under BC’s protocol reported 100 [*]year cumulative emissions using the BC-HWPv 1 the emissions would be lower by about 11 %.

The adoption of a method for accountingfor these flows in the IPCC guidelines mayhave implications for the trade of <b>wood</b> <b>products</b> and thus on global forestmanagement. Four methods of accounting for <b>wood</b> <b>products</b> in an international perspective areanalyzed in the present study.

These methods include the presentdefault IPCC method and three alternatives: flow consumption, flow production,and stock change. All fourmethodologies are applied to the 1990 data of Gabon, Sweden, and TheNetherlands. The impact of accounting for <b>wood</b> <b>products</b> using alternative methods has –in some cases – a large impact on the carbonbalance of the Land Use Change and Forestry (LUCF) sector. In the case of TheNetherlands, it was found that theLUCF carbon balance could be `converted' from a sink into a source dependingon the method chosen. However,the LUCF sector is very small compared to the total national carbon balancein The Netherlands. In Sweden, a countrywhere the forest sector plays an important role, the alternative wood productmethods influence the total nationalcarbon balance by 34 %. In Gabon, a country with conversion forestry,the impact of alternative wood productmethods hardly influences the LUCF carbon balance because the emissions fromdeforestation are very large. The accounting method may have a large impact on the way countries regardtheir trade in <b>wood</b> <b>products.</b> It may bepossible for countries to buy a sink through the <b>wood</b> <b>products</b> trade, byimporting products faster than they decomposedomestically.

We develop two scenarios to quantify the magnitude of CO 2 emissions by (1) energetic utilization, and (2) energetic and material utilization of harvested timber and compare the substitution effects for different fossil energy sources. Results The direct energetic use of harvested timber does not compensate for the losses of forest carbon stock. Logging residuals and displacement factors reflecting different wood use constitute by far {{the most important factor in}} potential emission reductions.

40|$|In {{life cycle}} {{assessment}} (LCA) of paper products, {{it is common to}} either assume that the carbon impacts of forestry are neutral (i. e. no net emissions) or to credit <b>harvested</b> <b>wood</b> <b>products</b> as a carbon store. When comparing virgin and recycled materials, this means that forest carbon flows are either shown as nil or a net sequestration credit. However, <b>harvested</b> <b>wood</b> <b>products</b> typically account for {{less than half of the}} carbon stored in a forest, with additional stores in below ground biomass, deadwood, litter and soils. Each of these stores may be affected by changes in demand for virgin pulp and paper. In this study the countries likely to provide pulp displaced by moving to recyclate, or used when switching from recyclate were identified for both the UK and China (the largest export market for UK-derived recyclate). Changes in forest carbon stores in each country were then assessed and attributed to the extraction of a unit of timber in each country where demand for pulp and paper was identified as a driver for change. The analysis shows that when switching from virgin to recycled content within the UK and China, no additional biogenic CO emissions are avoided with the exception of Canadian pulp, where the data suggests that forests are being degraded, with associated carbon losses. When switching from recycled to virgin content, net biogenic CO emissions are seen from most relevant countries. In the example of newsprint, this is equivalent to 2 - 23 tonnes CO per tonne of newsprint. The exceptions to this are Chile and Russia, where demand for virgin fibre does not appear to be associated with deforestation. Despite limitations, the research highlights that biogenic carbon is a significant issue which may dominate the outcome of LCAs assessing the climate change impact of switching between virgin and recycled pulp...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims {{to obtain}} the {{appropriate}} policy about <b>Harvested</b> <b>Wood</b> <b>Products</b> in the way to clarify the movement of carbon in {{the life cycle of}} wooden detached houses. This study revealed that: 1) The amount of the carbon of the wooden house is 20 - 40 % of the log cutted down from the forest. And, as for the component ratio of the carbon emission by wooden house construction, the circulating carbon in a short span exceeds 50 %. 2) The circulating carbon in a short span emissions are greatly affected a yield rate of timber production. So it is important to use the wood of a high yield rate of production to achieve an efficient carbon storage. 3) It is possible to improve the carbon stock efficiency by raising the amount of the wood use per a house...|$|R
40|$|To {{quantify}} {{the climate change}} impacts of forestry and forest management options, we must consider the entire forestry system: the carbon dynamics of the forest, {{the life cycle of}} <b>harvested</b> <b>wood</b> <b>products,</b> and the substitution benefit of using biomass and <b>wood</b> <b>products</b> compared to more greenhouse gas intensive options. This paper presents modelled estimates of the greenhouse gas balance of two key native forest areas managed for production in New South Wales for a period of 200 years, and compares it to the option of managing for conservation only. These two case studies show that forests managed for production provide the greatest ongoing greenhouse gas benefits, with long-term carbon storage in products, and product substitution benefits critical to the outcome. Thus native forests could play a significant part in climate change mitigation, particularly when sustainably managed for production of <b>wood</b> and non-wood <b>products</b> including biomass for bioenergy. The potential role of production forestry in mitigating climate change, though substantial, has been largely overlooked in recent Australian climate change policy...|$|R
40|$|Cancun {{invited the}} IPCC to prepare {{additional}} methodological guidance on wetlands, {{focusing on the}} rewetting and restoration of peatland. 2. The 2006 IPCC Guidelines themselves note that the guidance on wetlands is incomplete. When the Wetlands chapter in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines was compiled there was insufficient scientific infor mation available to complete methodologies for all subcategories, and so methods are only available for some emissions from flooded lands and from peatlands being harvested. 3. This was considered at the “IPCC expert meeting on <b>Harvested</b> <b>Wood</b> <b>Products,</b> Wetlands and N 2 O Emissions from Soils”, held in Geneva, 19 th- 21 st October 2010, that concluded, “Since the 2006 IPCC Guidelines were completed much new scientific information is now available about various wetlands that enable emissions and removals to be estimated from wetland restoration and rewetting especially for peat lands. The meeting recommended that the IPCC provide additional methodological guidelines for the rewetting and restoration of peat land; emissions from fires, ditches and waterborne carbon; and constructed wetlands for waste water disposal, to fill gaps in the existing guidelines. ” 4. Finally this was considered by the UNFCCC SBSTA at its 33 rd se ssion that concluded (Document FCCC/SBSTA/ 2010 /L. 18, paragraph 4) : “The SBSTA took note of the summary of the co-chairs of the IPCC expert meeting on <b>harvested</b> <b>wood</b> <b>products,</b> wetlands and N 2 O emissions from soils. Noting that science has developed in some areas with regard to wetlands, the SBSTA invited the IPCC to undertake further methodological work on wetlands, focusing on the rewetting and restoration of peatland, {{with a view to}} filling in the gaps in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (hereinafter referred to as the 2006 IPCC Guidelines) in these areas and to complete this work for the thirty-ninth session of the SBSTA. ” 5. This task aims to fu lfil this invita tion by filling gaps in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines...|$|R
40|$|In a globalised world, the {{transfer}} of carbon between regions, either physically or embodied in production, represents a substantial fraction of global carbon emissions. The resulting emission transfers are important for balancing regional carbon budgets and for understanding the drivers of emissions. In this paper we synthesise current understanding in two parts: (1) CO 2  emissions embodied in goods and services that are produced in one country but consumed in others, and (2) carbon physically present in fossil fuels, petroleum-derived <b>products,</b> <b>harvested</b> <b>wood</b> <b>products,</b> crops, and livestock products. We describe the key differences between studies and provide a consistent set of estimates using the same definitions, modelling framework, and consistent data. We find the largest trade flows of carbon in international trade in 2004 were fossil fuels (2673 MtC, 37 % of global emissions), CO 2  embodied in traded goods and services (1661 MtC, 22 % of global emissions), crops (522 MtC, 31 % of total harvested crop carbon), petroleum-based products (183 MtC, 50 % of their total production), <b>harvested</b> <b>wood</b> <b>products</b> (149 MtC, 40 % of total roundwood extraction), and livestock products (28 MtC, 22 % of total livestock carbon). We find that for embodied CO 2  emissions, estimates from independent studies are robust, and that differences between individual studies are not {{a reflection of the}} uncertainty in consumption-based estimates, but rather these differences result from the use of different production-based emissions input data and different definitions for allocating emissions to international trade. After adjusting for these issues, results across independent studies converge to give less uncertainty than previously assumed. For physical carbon flows there are relatively few studies to be synthesised, but differences between existing studies are due to the method of allocating to international trade, with some studies using "apparent consumption" as opposed to "final consumption". While results across studies are sufficiently robust to be used in further applications, {{more research is needed to}} understand differences and to harmonise definitions for particular applications...|$|R
40|$|This study {{compares the}} cradle-to-gate total energy and major {{emissions}} for {{the extraction of}} raw materials, production, and transportation of the common wood building materials from the CORRIM 2004 reports. A life-cycle inventory produced the raw materials, including fuel resources and emission to air, water, and land for glued-laminated timbers, kiln-dried and green softwood lumber, laminated veneer lumber, softwood plywood, and oriented strandboard. Major findings from these comparisons were that the production of <b>wood</b> <b>products,</b> {{by the nature of}} the industry, uses a third of their energy consumption from renewable resources and the remainder from fossil-based, non-renewable resources when the system boundaries consider forest regeneration and <b>harvesting,</b> <b>wood</b> <b>products</b> and resin production, and trans-portation life-cycle stages. When the system boundaries are reduced to a gate-to-gate (manufacturing life-cycle stage) model for the <b>wood</b> <b>products,</b> the biomass component of the manufacturing energy increases to nearly 50 % for most products and as high as 78 % for lumber production from the Southeast. The manufacturing life-cycle stage consumed the most energy over all the products when resin is considered part of the production process. Extraction of log resources and transportation of raw materials for production had the least environmental impact...|$|R

30|$|Carbon {{absorbed by}} forests remains {{stored in the}} timber used for <b>wood</b> <b>products,</b> and a change in <b>wood</b> <b>product</b> stock can be {{evaluated}} as substantial removal/emission of atmospheric carbon. Since the carbon storage effect due to <b>harvested</b> <b>wood</b> <b>products</b> (HWP) might {{be taken into account}} in the future framework of carbon mitigation, it is crucial to estimate the carbon fl ow and stock concerning HWP for the next commitment period. In the present study, we developed a model for estimating the fl ow and stock of <b>wood</b> <b>products</b> in Japan’s building, furniture, and paper sectors. The HWP carbon storage effect and substitution effect (carbon reduction by substituting fossil fuels and energy-intensive materials with HWP) up to 2050 were quantitatively estimated by lifetime analysis. Our model simulation revealed that (i) the carbon stock change in Japan due to HWP would be evaluated as a large emission if the atmospheric-fl ow approach is adopted, (ii) carbon removal would not significantly increase if the ratio of newly constructed wooden buildings/furniture remains stable, and (iii) the carbon storage effect together with the substitution effect would {{have a significant impact on}} climate change mitigation if the ratio of newly constructed wooden buildings/furniture is gradually improved to 70 % by 2050.|$|R
