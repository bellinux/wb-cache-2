40|$|In a multisensory task, human adults {{integrate}} {{information from}} different sensory modalities [...] behaviorally in an optimal Bayesian fashion [...] while children mostly {{rely on a}} single sensor modality for decision making. The reason behind this change of behavior over age and the process behind learning the required statistics for optimal integration are still unclear and have not been justified by the conventional Bayesian modeling. We propose an interactive multisensory learning framework without making any prior assumptions about the sensory models. In this framework, learning in every modality and in their joint space is done in parallel using a single-step reinforcement learning method. A simple statistical test on confidence intervals on the mean of reward distributions is used to select the most <b>informative</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> among the individual modalities and the joint space. Analyses of the method and the simulation results on a multimodal localization task show that the learning system autonomously starts with sensory selection and gradually switches to sensory integration. This is because, relying more on modalities [...] i. e. selection [...] at early learning steps (childhood) is more rewarding than favoring decisions learned in the joint space since, smaller state-space in modalities results in faster learning in every individual modality. In contrast, after gaining sufficient experiences (adulthood), the quality of learning in the joint space matures while learning in modalities suffers from insufficient accuracy due to perceptual aliasing. It results in tighter confidence interval for the joint space and consequently causes a smooth shift from selection to integration. It suggests that sensory selection and integration are emergent behavior and both are outputs of a single reward maximization process; i. e. the transition is not a preprogrammed phenomenon...|$|E
40|$|Rendering high-definition 3 D {{models is}} {{becoming}} a commonly requested task for scientific simulation, visualization and computer graphics. Many research areas generate extremely complex 3 D models, such as industrial CAD models (e. g. airplanes, ships and architectures), composed of more than {{hundreds of millions of}} geometric primitives. However, these complex datasets cannot be rendered efficiently using brute-force methods on a desktop workstation. Desktop computer technology has recently reached a point where it has advanced sufficiently to calculate and process a number of photographs of an object from different perspectives to produce an accurate three-dimensional (3 D) high-definition digital model. This project explores the potential applications of 3 D digital models in terms of extracting complex geological data. Different methods of data acquisition and the scale of outcrops are compared between difficult to access rock outcrops in a remote High Himalayan region of Photoksar, Ladakh to more accessible, low lying coastal areas on the NSW South Coast at Bingie Bingie Point, Narooma, Wolumla and Eden. Archaeological sites and ultra-high resolution aerial photographs are also applied to the methods outlined. The application of photogrammetry at each site is assessed and compared to determine the benefit of it is applicable in any or all regions. The methods are assessed for efficiency, convenience and relevance of extracting complex structural geological data with emphasis on developing the highest quality digital 3 D models possible. Any data extracted is tested for accuracy by comparing it with structural geological measurements obtained on the field by traditional methods using the trusted Field Move mobile application as a compass and clinometer equivalent. The results aim to provide a reliable and <b>informative</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> outlining the methods used, what equipment is needed and what information can be extracted...|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{concentrates on}} {{issues associated with}} people with hearing problems and their relationship with theatrical art. The aim of this work is to introduce the problems of studying theatrical art by individuals that are hearing impaired, and also {{the problems associated with}} employment for these people. The specifics of being hearing impaired are described in the theoretical section, including communication and education of the hearing impaired. The next chapter addresses theatrical art in relationship to the hearing impaired people. It also includes the performance of university subject Educational Drama of the Deaf (further reffered to as VDN). Also the employment opportunities after graduation from this university subject are covered and chapters the Hearing Impaired as Artists and Hearing Impaired as Educators are included. There is a very limited amount of specialist literature available on this problematic. It was chosen qualitative research method by using half structured interview so the information in the theoretical part were specified or broadened so the reader gets the best possible overview about this problematic. The target group were hearing impaired graduates of the VDN subject, they have the greatest experience in this sphere and therefore they can pass on lots of important information. By the interest of these graduates it can be concluded, that educational subjects opened up for specific target groups is a positive move towards breaking barriers between people who have normal hearing and people who are hearing impaired. This subject could be a model for specialists and the public, on how to further broaden and improve conditions for all disabled people. As outlined above, the scope of this of this bachelor thesis includes an analysis of the concerns of the specifics of the Hearing Impaired Theatre, the analysis incorporates the theatrical performance of the VDN students from a hearing impaired point of view. This bachelor thesis can be an <b>informative</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> for the normal hearing part of a population about the problematic of the hearing impaired and about the Hearing Impaired Theatre...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{begins with}} {{the premise that the}} life and work of a {{composer}} need not necessarily be considered in contemporary musicological criticism as distinct entities; rather, this thesis sets out to demonstrate that the life and work of a composer can, within the appropriate critical constraints, be mutually <b>informative</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> and may be even considered as inextricably linked. The first part of this thesis identifies the historical reasoning behind the rejection of biography by traditional musicologies – namely the perception that biography is both unrelated to musicological enquiry and not a critically viable/empirical <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>information.</b> The trend in contemporary ‘critical’ musicology away from less dogmatic and empirical modes of criticism and towards more subjective lines of enquiry is used as a foundation upon which a new methodology (that allows biographical insight to function meaningfully within musicology) can be built. This methodology is named ‘musico-psychobiography’ as it proposes that the nascent interpretive field of psychobiography might be better suited to a theoretical construction that demands critical reliability and analytical rigour than traditional conceptions of biography. The first part of this thesis concludes with an exegesis of the key theoretical objections to this pursuit, and offers counterpositions to them in order to secure a stable methodological process. The second part of this thesis is dedicated to the practical exploration of this methodology by means of a case study of composer Maurice Ravel and his opera L’Enfant et les sortilèges. A close reading of the psychological dynamics articulated by L’Enfant in conjunction with an assessment of key psychobiographical saliences in operation in Ravel’s life leads us to a number of interesting conclusions; moreover, by modifying the psychodynamic concept of projective identification to apply to a composer and their work, we are able to explore in a different light the dynamics of interaction between Ravel and his opera...|$|R

40|$|Facial {{expression}} is one <b>of</b> the most <b>informative</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> non-verbal <b>information.</b> Early {{studies on the}} ability to recognize emotions over the face, pointed to the universality of emotion expression and recognition. More recent studies have shown a combination of universal mechanisms and cultural-specific patterns. The process of emotion recognition is based on face perception that’s why the in-group effect should be taken under consideration. The in-group advantage hypothesis posits that observers are more accurate at recognizing facial expressions displayed by the same culture compared to other culture members. On the other hand, the process of emotion recognition is determined by such cognitive features as a cognitive style. This article describes the approaches to emotion expression and recognition, culture-specific features to basic emotion expression. It also describes factors related to recognition of basic emotions by people from different cultures. It was discovered that field-independent people are more accurate in emotion recognition than field- dependent people because they are able to distinguish markers of emotions. There was found no correlation between successful emotion recognition and the observers’ gender, no correlation between successful emotion recognition and the observers’ rac...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} research was to analyze factors influencing interest groups and their membership so as to examine their preferences and strategies pertaining to emerging wave energy technology. Using qualitative research methods, this study includes: 1) an in-depth content analysis of semi- structured interviews specifically seeking to learn where people, namely interest groups, acquire their information about wave energy and if they currently have strategies to promote their preferences; 2) stakeholder input from surveys sent throughout the state to interest group representatives spanning five different sectors; and 3) an evaluation of interview and survey data using a backdrop of five research questions to tell the story wave energy development has had on interest groups in five sectors. Five interest group sectors were: 1) workforce, 2) commercial fishing, 3) recreational, 4) environmental, and 5) energy developers. Key findings suggest interest groups formulate their strategies based on how <b>informative</b> their <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> were and where their membership lives in proximity to the coast. A significant trait evidenced by the formation of interest groups with a smaller membership was their use of lobbying. Some groups, regardless of their size, took a much more cautious stance to wave energy as there was a continued need to collect information from their membership. Interest groups were not always subscribing to the notion of a consensus approach as some groups were informed but hesitant in how to participate in wave energy as their leadership was also focused on other projects...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Peripheral {{blood is}} an {{accessible}} and <b>informative</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> transcriptomal <b>information</b> for many human disease and pharmacogenomic studies. While {{there can be}} significant advantages to analyzing RNA isolated from whole blood, particularly in clinical studies, the preparation of samples for microarray analysis {{is complicated by the}} need to minimize artifacts associated with highly abundant globin RNA transcripts. The impact of globin RNA transcripts on expression profiling data can potentially be reduced by using RNA preparation and labeling methods that remove or block globin RNA during the microarray assay. We compared four different methods for preparing microarray hybridization targets from human whole blood collected in PAXGene tubes. Three of the methods utilized the Affymetrix one-cycle cDNA synthesis/in vitro transcription protocol but varied treatment of input RNA as follows: i. no treatment; ii. treatment with GLOBINclear; or iii. treatment with globin PNA oligos. In the fourth method cDNA targets were prepared with the Ovation amplification and labeling system. Results We find that microarray targets generated with labeling methods that reduce globin mRNA levels or minimize the impact of globin transcripts during hybridization detect more transcripts in the microarray assay compared with the standard Affymetrix method. Comparison of microarray results with quantitative PCR analysis of a panel of genes from the NF-kappa B pathway shows good correlation of transcript measurements produced with all four target preparation methods, although method-specific differences in overall correlation were observed. The impact of freezing blood collected in PAXGene tubes on data reproducibility was also examined. Expression profiles show little or no difference when RNA is extracted from either fresh or frozen blood samples. Conclusion RNA preparation and labeling methods designed to reduce the impact of globin mRNA transcripts can significantly improve the sensitivity of the DNA microarray expression profiling assay for whole blood samples. While blockage of globin transcripts during first strand cDNA synthesis with globin PNAs resulted in the best overall performance in this study, we conclude that selection of a protocol for expression profiling studies in blood should depend on several factors, including implementation requirements of the method and study design. RNA isolated from either freshly collected or frozen blood samples stored in PAXGene tubes can be used without altering gene expression profiles. </p...|$|R
40|$|Project (M. A., Child Development (Theory and Research)) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2010. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is {{a complex}} neuro-developmental {{disorder}} that severely compromises functioning in multiple developmental domains (Rogers et al., 2006). Children with ASD often show deficits in the social domain (McClellan & Katz, 1992; Webster, Feiler, & Webster, 2003). Many children with ASD lack emotion regulation, and other key social skills related to social competence. There are a variety <b>of</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> available for families who have children with ASD. However, the information is typically not easily comprehensible for all populations. The presentation <b>of</b> the <b>information</b> is typically not sequential, and does not focus on all pertinent areas (e. g. deficits of autism, services available, how to obtain services, descriptions of research). Further, families with children with ASD often report that they feel isolated (Thomas, Morrissey, & McLaurin, 2007). The current project was therefore designed to provide families who have children with autism with a simple but <b>informative</b> web-based <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> about ASD, treatment options, and local resources for treatment and evaluation. The authors consulted several sources {{in order to develop}} the website. First, the authors conducted a literature search on ASD and ASD treatment options and effectiveness. Next, a needs assessment with families of children with ASD was conducted to reveal gaps in parents??? knowledge. Finally, the authors conducted a search <b>of</b> existing web-based <b>information</b> for families, including a search of local agencies and services for children and families. The information gathered from these sources was posted on an informational website, which was then evaluated by families of children with ASD in terms of usefulness and ease of use. Results of the web site evaluation revealed that the families found the web site to be concise, comprehensive, and helpful. Recommendations are made for future use of web site technology to assist families with ASD. The two authors collaborated on this web site project.

40|$|The {{human mind}} rapidly parses high-dimensional dynamic input into useful representations. Identifying the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> {{relevant}} sensory <b>information</b> in time {{is critical to}} the formation <b>of</b> <b>informative</b> perceptions. One <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> to aid perceptual processing is the temporal regularity of sensory input. Knowledge of what regularities are utilized and how they are utilized is critical to understanding how perception functions in a dynamic world. The objective of this dissertation is to explore the adaptations of perception to temporal regularities in the environment. Chapters 1 and 2 use short term priming paradigms to examine the temporal segregation <b>of</b> perceptual <b>information.</b> Chapter 1 shows that inverted versus upright faces have different time courses of priming, suggesting that familiarity plays a role in temporal segregation. Furthermore, for faces, there are individual differences in priming dynamics related to perceptual identification ability. Chapter 2 examines the influence of occurrence and co-occurrence statistics in the same task. Several incremental reductions of stimulus frequency at different levels of representation all slow priming compared to higher occurring word stimuli. Word associations as a measure of co-occurrence, produce waxing and waning priming effects, with a small effect of the order of the associative relationship. Priming based on direct measures of linguistic co-occurrence produces priming dynamics that are similar to associative priming. Words which are expected to repeat provide a small increase in priming compared to priming by repeating a word. These priming effects are interpreted as the result of habituation. The findings in Chapters 1 and 2 generalize the habituation account of priming effects to faces, demonstrate its dependence on the occurrence rates of stimuli, and show that temporal co-occurrence regularities for particular items only result in small changes to the basic dynamics. Chapter 3 uses a spatial cueing paradigm to test if we adapt to diagnostic spatial-temporal relationships. Participants implicitly learn and generalize diagnostic cue-target relationships with long delays between cues and target. Diagnostic relationships are also learned for short cue-target delays when no shift of expectation is required. As a whole, these experiments find that temporal regularities pertaining to familiarity and general occurrence relationships are strongly reflected in the dynamics of perception, and that directional associations or expectations between individual stimuli deviate only slightly from general dynamic...|$|R
