This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the feasibility of using Raman chemical imaging (i. e., Raman imaging microspectroscopy) to establish chemical identity, particle size and particle size distribution (PSD) for a representative corticosteroid in aqueous nasal <b>spray</b> <b>suspension</b> formulations. Materials and Methods. The Raman imaging PSD protocol was validated using polystyrene (PS) microsphere size standards (NIST-traceable). A Raman spectral library was developed for the active and inactive compounds in the formulation. Four nasal sprays formulated with beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) ranging in size from 1. 4 to 8. 3 mm were imaged by both Raman and brightfield techniques. The Raman images were then processed to calculate the PSD for each formulation. Results. Within each region examined, active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) particles are unambig-uously identified and the total number of those particles, particle size and PSD of API free of excipients and PSD of API particles adhered to other excipients are reported. Conclusions. Good statistical agreement is obtained between the reported and measured sizes of the PS microspheres. BDP particles were clearly distinguishable from those of excipients. Raman chemical imaging (RCI) is able to differentiate between and identify the chemical makeup of multiple components in complex BDP sample and placebo mixtures. The Raman chemical imaging method (coupled Raman and optical imaging) shows promise as a method for characterizing particle size and shape of corticosteroid in aqueous nasal <b>spray</b> <b>suspension</b> formulations.

Poliovirus and T coliphage, which possess no structural lipid, retained high levels of infectivity following aerosolization at relative humidites of 7 o ~ or above; at lower relative humidities they were inactivated rapidly. This rapid inactivation was increased further at lower solute concentrations of the spray fluid. The infectivities of aerosolized polioviruses and coliphages depended on the mode of rehydration during collection of the aerosols, but the infectivities of arboviruses in aerosols were unaffected by this. Atmospheric oxygen was not toxic to viruses in the aerosol state...|$|R
40|$|A new {{approach}} to the surface functionalization of magnetic polystyrene microbeads with chloroacetyl chloride {{in the presence of}} aluminum chloride was reported. Composite microbeads consisting of polymer-coated iron oxide nanoparticles were prepared by <b>spraying</b> <b>suspension</b> polymerization. Functional chloride groups were introduced onto the sur face of magnetic polystyrene microbeads by surface chemical reaction without destroying the magnetite nanoparticles within the microbeads. First, a complex was synthesized by a reaction between aluminum chloride and chloroacetyl chloride. Then, the complex was added dropwise to the solution of magnetic polystyrene microbeads, and a surface acylation reaction between complex and polystyrene microbeads was carried out. Subsequently, the amino groups were coupled to the magnetic microbeads via an ammonolysis reaction between ethylenediamine and chloride groups on the. acylated magnetic polystyrene microbeads. The chemical composition, surface functional groups, and magnetism of the magnetic polystyrene microbeads before and after surface functionalization were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and vibrating sample magnetometry. The results showed that the surface functionalization reaction had little impact on the magnetism of the microbeads. The content of surface amino groups on the magnetic polystyrene microbeads was found to be 0. 2 mmol/g. An affinity dye, Cibacron Blue F 3 G-A (CB), was then immobilized to prepare a magnetic affinity adsorbent. It was confirmed from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectra that, the CB molecules were covalently coupled on the magnetic microbeads.

40|$|The aerosol {{survival}} of Escherichia coli JEPP, a particularly sensitive strain, {{has been studied}} {{in a nitrogen atmosphere}} (> 99. 9 yo) when <b>sprayed</b> from <b>suspension</b> in solutions of sodium glutamate or glycerol, and collected into phosphate buffer with or without M-sucrose. The response caused by changes in relative humidity (RH) to 30 % and I O O ~ ~ before collection was also examined, These two protecting agents were selected because glycerol readily permeated the cytoplasmic membrane, whereas sodium glutamate did not. E. coli JEPP <b>sprayed</b> as a <b>suspension</b> in sodium glutamate and collected in phosphate buffer showed two minima in the survival versus RH curves: (i) a comparatively narrow zone between go and 82 % RH; (ii) a broad instabdity zone between 82 and 50 % RH. The presence of sucrose in the collecting fluid increased the survival for storage above 50 % RH, but decreased it below 50 % RH. For storage above 50 % RH a change to I 00 % RH before collection increased the survival for collection in phosphate buffer but not in phosphate buffer+sucrose; below 50 % RH this chang...|$|R
40|$|<b>Suspension</b> <b>spraying</b> {{is a new}} {{technology}} {{in the group of}} thermal spray processes. It makes use of suspensions instead of feedstock powders and is mainly applied in APS and HVOF processes. Apart from development of suitable suspensions, adaptation of the system equipment for feeding and injection into the plasma or flame is necessary. The advantages and application potential of suspensionsprayed coatings are multitudinous, one of the main aspects being the possibility of preparing coatings with thicknesses of a few ?m and high bond strength. With <b>suspension</b> <b>spraying,</b> the technological gap in terms of achievable coating thicknesses between traditional spray coatings and other surface technologies is bridged. In addition, finely dispersed materials can be processed directly without the need for preparation of feedstock powders. Due to different phase compositions for well-known materials such as aluminum oxide and titanium oxide, new coating properties can also be obtained...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePlasma {{generated}} by the SG- 100 torch was applied to <b>spray</b> <b>suspension</b> formulated {{with the use of}} ZrO 2 + 8 wt. % Y 2 O 3 (8 YSZ) and ZrO 2 + 24 wt. % CeO 2 + 2. 5 wt. % Y 2 O 3 (24 CeYSZ) as solid phases. The suspensions were formulated with the use of 20 wt. % solid phase, 40 wt. % water, and 40 wt. % ethanol. The plasma spray parameters were optimized by keeping constant: (a) the electric power of 40 kW and (b) the working gas compositions of 45 slpm for Ar and 5 slpm for H 2. On the other hand, the spray distance was varied from 40 to 60 mm and the torch linear speed was varied from 300 to 500 mm/s. The coatings were sprayed onto stainless steel substrates, and their thicknesses were in the range from 70 to 110 μm. The coating microstructures were analyzed with a scanning electron microscope. Mechanical properties were tested with the different methods including the indentation and scratch tests. The indentation test, carried out with various loads ranging from 100 to 10, 000 mN, enabled to determine elastic modulus and Martens microhardness. Young's modulus of the coatings was in the range of 71 - 107 GPa for 8 YSZ and 68 - 130 GPa for 24 CeYSZ coatings. The scratch test enabled the authors to find the scratch macrohardness...|$|R
40|$|In this contribution, {{the main}} aspects of thermal <b>spraying</b> with <b>suspensions,</b> which {{have to be}} {{considered}} in order to produce <b>suspension</b> <b>sprayed</b> coatings in an economical way, are presented. The economic efficiency of the process depends on the availability of suitable additional system components (suspension feeder, injectors), on the development and handling of stable suspensions, {{as well as on the}} high process stability for acceptance at industrial scale. Special focus is made on thedevelopment and processability of water-based suspensions of ceramic oxides. The use of water as a liquid media for preparing suspensions is often critically discussed due to the necessity of a higher heat input during <b>spraying</b> compared toalcoholic <b>suspensions.</b> In fact, the safe and environmental friendly manufacturing as well as lower production and transport costs clearly speak for the industrial use of aqueous suspensions. Recent devel-opments have demonstrated successful production and processing of highly concentrated aqueous suspensions (of 50 wt. % or more). The economic aspects in terms of deposition efficiencies and feed rates in relation to the solids content of aqueous suspensions of different ceramic oxides are discussed. In the case of alumina S-HVOF coatings feed rates between 15 to 35 g/min and deposition efficiencies up to 65 – 70 % could be reached with aqueous suspensions. The coating hardness (850 HV 0. 3) did not change with increase of the suspension concentration from 35 to 50 wt. %. For high melting temperature S-HVOF coatings like chromia, yttria, or yttria-stabilized zirconia the deposition efficiencies (15 – 30 %) and coating thicknesses deposited per pass (2 – 5 μm/pass) were lower than in the case of alumina. Cr 2 O 3 S-HVOF coatings with microhardness values in the range 1150 – 1450 HV 0. 3, which were higher than those of the conventional APS coatings, were produced with different aqueous Cr 2 O 3 suspensions...|$|R
