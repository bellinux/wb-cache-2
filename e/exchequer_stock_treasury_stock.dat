40|$|This study investigates {{corporate}} {{reactions to}} the deregulation of stock repurchases set forth on 1 October 2001, in Japan, {{by looking at the}} motivations for stock repurchases. We found that stock repurchases increased significantly after the ban on <b>treasury</b> <b>stocks</b> was lifted. Our results show that firms with free-cash flow problems initiated a repurchase plan to distribute excess cash to shareholders and reduce agency costs over the sample period. In addition, firms who wanted to signal undervaluation also undertook stock repurchases over the sample period. These firms were affected by the deregulation, unlike firms that repurchase to reduce agency costs. We determined that firms with weak incentives to signal undervaluation increased stock repurchases significantly in order to respond to the deregulation, since these firms had the ability to take advantage of <b>treasury</b> <b>stock</b> purchases. <b>Treasury</b> <b>stocks,</b> Undervaluation, Takeover deterrence, Capital structure, Cash distribution...|$|R
50|$|Unissued {{stock is}} stock {{that has been}} {{authorized}} in a company's charter, but has never been sold. It differs from <b>Treasury</b> <b>stock</b> (in the UK, <b>Treasury</b> shares, as <b>treasury</b> <b>stock</b> means something else), in that <b>treasury</b> <b>stock</b> has been issued, and bought back by the company, whereas unissued stock has never been issued.|$|R

50|$|One way of {{accounting}} for <b>treasury</b> <b>stock</b> {{is with the}} cost method. In this method, the paid-in capital account is reduced in the balance sheet when the <b>treasury</b> <b>stock</b> is bought. When the <b>treasury</b> <b>stock</b> is sold back on the open market, the paid-in capital is either debited or credited if it is sold for less or more than the initial cost respectively.|$|R
5000|$|In either method, any {{transaction}} involving <b>treasury</b> <b>stock</b> cannot {{increase the}} amount of retained earnings. If the <b>treasury</b> <b>stock</b> is sold for more than cost, then the paid-in capital <b>treasury</b> <b>stock</b> is the account that is increased, not retained earnings. In auditing financial statements, it is a common practice to check for this error to detect possible attempts to [...] "cook the books." ...|$|R
50|$|Another common way for {{accounting}} for <b>treasury</b> <b>stock</b> is the par value method. In the par value method, {{when the stock}} is purchased back from the market, the books will reflect the action as a retirement of the shares. Therefore, common <b>stock</b> is debited and <b>treasury</b> <b>stock</b> is credited. However, when the <b>treasury</b> <b>stock</b> is resold back to the market the entry in the books {{will be the same}} as the cost method.|$|R

40|$|<b>Treasury</b> <b>stock</b> {{and firm}} market value using a {{modified}} Tobin's q are modeled {{by using a}} firm utility preference function and a quadratic constraint function.

40|$|In {{recent years}} the US {{corporate}} sector has deployed more cash from operations to finance the repurchase of outstanding share capital for <b>treasury</b> <b>stock.</b> Shares repurchased for <b>treasury</b> <b>stock</b> can help flatter earnings per share, fund senior management share option compensation schemes and finance corporate acquisitions.

40|$|In {{order to}} provide {{investing}} reference for judging whether the information disclosure is true or not, this paper investigates the effect of corporate governance on quality of information disclosure with {{an example of the}} third-purpose <b>treasury</b> <b>stock</b> announcement in Taiwan. With a sample of the listed companies that made the first <b>treasury</b> <b>stock</b> announcement between 2000 and 2003, this paper adopts the logistic regression model to empirically examine the effect. With control variables of the firm size, operating performance and debt ratio, the dependent variable of the model is the quality of information disclosure, and the independent variables include variables of the ownership structure and director board structure. As the results shown, the significant relation between corporate governance and quality of information disclosure is supported. Besides the variable of directors holding is significantly positive to the quality of information disclosure, the significantly negative variables are the separation of control rights and cash flow rights, and management holding...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1950's the United State's Treasury became a begrudging {{supplier}} of silver at $ [...]905 an ounce. Bennett {{warned that the}} lack of supply versus the high demand would cause the deficit to fall on the <b>Treasury</b> <b>Stocks.</b> By 1961 the <b>Treasury</b> <b>Stocks</b> had unnecessarily been depleted. In 1963 the government only had 30 million ounces of free silver against the annual coinage requirement for the United States of more than 75 million ounces. The price of silver per ounce was now $ 1.2929 but if the United States bought extra silver the price would go above $ 1.29. The Silver Purchase Act of 1963 was supported by Bennett, the act repealed [...] "existing silver purchase requirements and the transfer of tax of silver bullion." [...] It also allowed the Federal Reserve to issue $1 and $2 notes to replace [...] "silver certificates or the denominations thus making 1.6 billion ounces of silver available to the United States Treasury." ...|$|R

40|$|Diluted EPS for Valuation and Financial Reporting We derive {{a measure}} of diluted EPS that {{incorporates}} economic implications of the dilutive effects of employee stock options. We show that the existing <b>treasury</b> <b>stock</b> method of accounting for the dilutive effects of outstanding options systematically understates the dilutive effect of stock options, and thereby overstates reported EPS. Using firm-wide data on 731 employee stock option plans, we find that economic dilution from options in our measure of options-diluted EPS is, on average, 100 % greater than dilution in reported diluted EPS using the <b>treasury</b> <b>stock</b> method required by SFAS No. 128. Incremental dilutive shares from stock options in the denominator of our measure of options-diluted EPS average 3. 0 % of common shares outstanding compared to 1. 5 % in reported diluted EPS. We also examine the implications of our analysis for stock price valuation, the price-earnings relation, and the return-earnings relation. We demonstrate that when firms have options outstanding, empirical applications of equity valuation models that utilize reported per share earnings as an input (e. g. ...|$|R
