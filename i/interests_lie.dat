25|$|Touretzky's {{research}} <b>interests</b> <b>lie</b> in {{the fields}} of artificial intelligence, computational neuroscience, and learning. This includes machine learning and animal learning, and in particular neural representation of space in rodents (e.g., in the hippocampus) and in robots. In 2006 he was recognized as a Distinguished Scientist by the Association for Computing Machinery.|$|E
25|$|His {{painting}} technique appeals {{primarily to}} a young and young at heart public whose <b>interests</b> <b>lie</b> in fashion, design and lifestyle products. As a result, Metzenmacher with his history in product design has added “collections” to go with each original. These collections are printed art pieces which differ in colour, size and fittings (frames). This idea of different collections came from the fashion industry and has been transferred {{to the world of}} art by Metzenmacher. He calls his collections “edition” and “rallipan”.|$|E
25|$|In {{many high}} schools {{incoming}} students may select science or liberal arts tracks {{depending on where}} their <b>interests</b> <b>lie.</b> The different learning tracks are {{commonly referred to as}} groups. Group I consists of liberal arts students, Group II and Group III of science based students (the latter studies biology as an additional subject). Science based curriculum consists of more rigorous science and mathematics classes intended to prepare the student for a career in the sciences and engineering; the liberal arts track places a heavier emphasis on literature and social studies to prepare students for a future in those fields. Often, students in Group I are exempted to study science even if they wish to, and students in Group II are not required to take geography, civics and history.|$|E

25|$|Fanta's older {{homosexual}} brother, {{and is a}} half-faerie like her. He shows extremely discriminative {{attitude towards}} all females except his sister, presumably because he had traumatic childhood relationship with his cold and distant mother. This also is implied to be the reason his romantic <b>interests</b> <b>lie</b> within males. He and his sister are close, {{even if they do}} argue sometimes like most siblings. Pain is the one who enchanted Ryang's skateboard (after hitting on him) so he could fight the evil affinities along with Fanta. Pain's best friend is Charon, the Prime Minister of Avalon and Medea's brother. Although the full extent of Pain's power is unknown, {{the fact that he has}} attained the position of Royal Inspector, a job which requires both power and precision, as well as being the only character seen so far that is able to hold off evil affinities. Like Fanta, he is much more powerful than the other inhabitants realize; as a child, he was able to detect Seraphina's spells when Charon and others could not. Pain also possesses powers to trace magical energy back to the original performer of magic.|$|E

The opening sentence states: [...] "The exposure to the Adelaide Steamship Company Limited Group of Companies was complex.", and if your <b>interests</b> <b>lie</b> in those directions, makes fascinating reading.|$|E

60|$|Another {{objection}} {{to a program}} {{which is to be}} realized suddenly at some remote date by a revolution or a general strike is that enthusiasm flags when there is nothing to do meanwhile, and no partial success to lessen the weariness of waiting. The only sort of movement which can succeed by such methods is one where the sentiment and the program are both very simple, {{as is the case in}} rebellions of oppressed nations. But the line of demarcation between capitalist and wage-earner is not sharp, like the line between Turk and Armenian, or between an Englishman and a native of India. Those who have advocated the social revolution have been mistaken in their political methods, chiefly because they have not realized how many people there are in the community whose sympathies and <b>interests</b> <b>lie</b> half on the side of capital, half on the side of labor. These people make a clear-cut revolutionary policy very difficult.|$|E

6000|$|... "The {{citizens}} of those towns are greatly divided in their opinions," [...] the captain said. [...] "Many would gladly rise {{if they had}} the chance, but they lie too close to the Spanish power to venture to do so. Still they are friendly enough to us; and as they have need of our goods and we of theirs, no one hinders traffic or interferes with those who come and go. Most of these towns have but small Spanish garrisons, and these concern themselves not with anything that goes on beyond maintaining the place for Spain. It is the Catholic magistrates appointed by Alva who manage the affairs of the towns, and as these are themselves mostly merchants and traders their <b>interests</b> <b>lie</b> in keeping the ports open and encouraging trade, so we come and go unquestioned. The Spaniards have enough on their hands already without causing discontent by restricting trade. Besides, the duke. affects to consider the rising in Holland and Zeeland as a trifling rebellion which he can suppress without difficulty, and it would be giving too much importance to the movement were he to close all the ports and forbid communication." ...|$|E
6000|$|Herbert Le Breton {{played a}} moment quietly with the Roman aureus of Domitian on his watch-chain; {{then he said}} slowly in his clear cold voice, 'There may be {{something}} in that, no doubt, Herr Schurz, {{for each of us}} has his own game to play, and while the world remains unreformed, he must play it on his own gambit to a great extent, without reference to the independent game of others. We all agree that the board is too full of counters, and as each counter is not responsible for its own presence and position on the board, having been put there without previous consultation by the players, we must each {{do the best we can}} for ourselves in our own fashion. My sympathies, as you say, are on your side, but perhaps my <b>interests</b> <b>lie</b> the other way, and after all, till you start your millennium, we must all rattle along as well as we can in the box together, jarring against one another in our old ugly round of competition, and supply and demand, and survival of the fittest, and mutual accommodation, and all the rest of it, to the end of the chapter. Every man for himself and God for us all, you know. You have the logic, to be sure, Herr Schurz, but the monopolists have the law and the money.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The Teutsch Ritters earned {{character}} in Palestine, {{and began to}} get bequests and recognition; but did not long continue there, like their two rival Orders. It was not in Palestine, whether the Orders might be aware of it or not, that their work could now lie. Pious Pilgrims certainly there still are in great numbers; to these you shall do the sacred rites: but these, under a Saladin bound by his word, need little protection by the sword. And as for Crusading in the armed fashion, that has fallen visibly into the decline. After Barbarossa, Coeur-de-Lion and Philippe Auguste have tried it with such failure, what wise man will be in haste to try it again? Zealous Popes continue to stir up Crusades; but the Secular Powers are not in earnest as formerly; Secular Powers, when they do go, [...] "take Constantinople," [...] "conquer Sicily," [...] never take or conquer anything in Palestine. The Teutsch Order helps valiantly in Palestine, or would help; {{but what is the}} use of helping? The Teutsch Order has already possessions in Europe, by pious bequest and otherwise; all its main <b>interests</b> <b>lie</b> there; in fine, after less than thirty years, Hermann von der Salza, a new sagacious TEUTSCHMEISTER or HOCHMEISTER (so they call the head of the Order), fourth in the series, a far-seeing, negotiating man, finds that Venice will be a fitter place of lodging for him than Acre: and accordingly during his long Mastership (A.D. 1210-1239), he is mostly to be found there, and not at Acre or Jerusalem.|$|E

60|$|I think, if {{he could}} shake himself free from that {{impossible}} conservatism he would realize that his <b>interests</b> <b>lie</b> {{with the interests of}} the intelligent working-class man--that is to say, in the direction of Socialism rather than in the direction of capitalistic competition; that the best use he can make of such educational and social advantages as still remain for him is to become the willing leader instead of the panic-fierce antagonist of the Socialist movement. His place, I hold, is to forward the development of that State and municipal machinery the Socialist foreshadows, and to secure for himself and his sons and daughters an adequate position and voice in the administration. Instead of struggling to diminish that burthen of public expenditure which educates and houses, conveys and protects him and his children, he ought rather to increase it joyfully, {{while at the same time}} working manfully to transfer its pressure to the broad shoulders of those very rich people who have hitherto evaded their legitimate share of it. The other course is to continue his present policy of obstinate resistance to the extension of public property and public services. In which case these things will necessarily become that basis of monopolistic property on which the coming plutocracy will establish itself. The middle-class man will be taxed and competed out of independence just the same, and he will become a salaried officer just the same, but with a different sort of master and under different social conditions according as one or other of these alternatives prevails.|$|E
60|$|This wild {{plan has}} been {{supported}} by sundry concessionists whose <b>interests</b> <b>lie</b> behind Dixcove and at Kinyanko. Dixcove of the crocodile-worship {{has one of the}} worst bars on the coast. Canoes and surf-boats must run within biscuit-throw of the Rock Kum-Brenni [Footnote: In the Oji or Ashanti-Fanti tongue bro or bronni (the Ga 'blofo') means somebody or something European. It is derived from abro (blo), maize, introduced by white men; others say that when the first strangers landed upon the coast, the women, who were grinding, said, 'These men are white as maize-meal.' 'Abrokirri' (Europe) is, however, explained by the Rev. Mr. Riis as perhaps a corruption of Puto, Porto, Portugal.] ('White Man's Death'), and the surf will often shut up the landing-place for four or five successive days. The place will become important, but not in this way. The Rev. Mr. Milum, in whose pleasant society I voyaged, showed me his sketch of the station with an isolated red 'butte,' possibly an island of old, rising close behind the houses and trending north-south. Grain-gold was found in it by the native schoolmaster, who dug where he saw a thin smoke or vapour hovering over the ground: throughout the Coast this, like the presence of certain ferns, is held a sure sign that the precious ore is present. Moreover, a small nugget appeared in the swish being prepared for a house-wall. Thus 'washing' will be easy and inexpensive, and the Wesleyan mission may secure funds for extending itself into the non-maritime regions.|$|E
