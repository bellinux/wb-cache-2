5|$|The North American {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Chris Milk and filmed in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in March 2005. The music video, however, was discarded by the record label, though this version won four Annual MVPA Awards. The video begins with Bedingfield waking up next to a boombox, dressing, brushing <b>her</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>and</b> leaving her home with the boombox. While performing {{on a beach in}} New York City, she kicks her boombox, which comes alive and begins to dance, and she leaves the beach and walks down the street. The video concludes with Bedingfield arriving back home to a house full of dancing boomboxes in the bedroom.|$|E

He then dismembered her body, removing <b>her</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>and</b> fingertips, putting her head in a paint can and then leaving the paint can in the woods of a southern New Jersey golf course and her legs farther north in New Jersey and then dumping her remaining torso and arms into the East River around New York City.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} several {{male and female}} models dressed up as {{soldiers}} on a fashion runway, wearing military garb and gas masks with one male model sports a shirt that reads [...] "Fashion Victim" [...] while it is inter-cut with scenes of Madonna singing {{in front of a}} black background. In the second chorus, middle-eastern children are seen walking on the runway, and being bullied by the soldier models. During the bridge, Madonna and her group prepare to enter the runway in a restroom, while she carves [...] "Protect Me" [...] on the partition of a stall and dances angrily with them to the song. The women also are seen dancing in front of surveillance cameras. When the rap section starts, Madonna is seen crashing into the show driving a Mini Cooper and pummel the photographers with an industrial-strength water hose, while rapping and dancing on top of the car with her gang. In the end of the video, Madonna frantically drives out of the runway into the amused audience, and pull a hand grenade with <b>her</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>and</b> then throws it to George W. Bush, and the video ends with him using it to light up his cigar.|$|E

500|$|Pfeiffer {{provides}} {{all of her}} character's vocals {{for both}} the film and its soundtrack. Because she does not consider herself a professional singer, Pfeiffer's inhibitions about singing on camera initially contributed to her early reservations about accepting the role, having not done so since her performance in Grease 2; The Fabulous Baker Boys would mark Pfeiffer's first professional singing role in seven years. Despite Kloves' insistence that Pfeiffer's singing voice not be dubbed, composer Dave Grusin was initially skeptical about Pfeiffer's musical abilities until she ultimately convinced him with her rendition of [...] "My Funny Valentine". For four months (although sources differ, citing any period of time between two months to an entire year), the actress took extensive singing lessons {{under the tutelage of}} voice coach Sally Stevens in preparation for the role, at the suggestion of Grusin. In addition to performing vocal exercises to strengthen her vocal chords, Pfeiffer would often work 10-hour days in the recording studio before finally returning home to listen to and study her own recordings. Already impressed with Pfeiffer's rhythm and phrasing, Stevens trained the actress to avoid pronouncing words in ways that would make the film's jazz standards sound too much like rock songs; Stevens jokenly linkened Pfeiffer's original pronunciation to musician Bob Dylan, and recording the songs for Pfieffer to use as reference for enunciation, teaching the actress about using <b>her</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>and</b> mouth to pronounce words and smiling to [...] "lift" [...] her pitch. Admitting that the film's songs were much more difficult than the ones she had performed in Grease 2, Pfeiffer worked especially hard on improving her phrasing because the material for The Fabulous Baker Boys were different than the pop music she had grown more accustomed to singing, explaining, [...] "Those older songs were written for singers; they weren't written for synthesizers and drums... It was an entirely new way of listening to songs." [...] Additionally, the actress drew inspiration from real-life lounge singers performing at The Hollyood Roosevelt Hotel in Los Angeles, while listening to jazz singers Sarah Vaughan, Dinah Washington, Rickie Lee Jones, Billie Holiday and Helen Merrill for inspiration, maintaining, [...] "I didn't copy anybody, but I heard a lot. For me, it helps to act the song out." [...] Pfeiffer incorporated the [...] "undercurrent of anger" [...] in the lounge singer's performances, drawn from the fact that [...] "a lot of club singers... haven't had the recognition they feel they deserve or that they had hoped for" [...] into her own interpretation of Susie. Stevens encouraged Pfeiffer to envision herself as Ingrid Bergman's character Ilsa Lund in the film Casablanca (1942) while recording [...] "More Than You Know" [...] for the film's soundtrack, which the actress identified as one of her favorite songs. Stevens also suggested that Pfeiffer research jazz singer Ella Fitzgerald because Fitzgerald possesses [...] "a quality artists of that period had that we felt the character Susie might have listened to", describing the end result as [...] "an airy alto, a nice breathy quality, and intelligence in delivery". Despite her extensive training, the vocal coach felt it was important that Susie's voice sound [...] "pleasant" [...] but still untrained. Kloves maintains that he did not hire Pfeiffer based on her singing abilities, but rather because {{of the way in which}} she uses her acting abilities to interpret lyrics.|$|E
2500|$|At this time, Thérèse {{was often}} sick; {{she began to}} suffer from nervous tremors. The tremors started one night after her uncle took her for a walk and {{began to talk about}} Zélie. Assuming that she was cold, the family covered Therese with blankets, but the tremors continued; she clenched <b>her</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>and</b> could not speak. [...] The family called Dr. Notta, who could make no diagnosis. In 1882, Dr. Gayral {{diagnosed}} that Thérèse [...] "reacts to an emotional frustration with a neurotic attack".|$|E
2500|$|The common {{legend of}} Yue {{receiving}} the tattoo {{from his mother}} first appeared in Shuo Yue Quanzhuan. In chapter 21 titled [...] "By a pretext Wang Zuo swore brotherhood, by tattoos Lady Yue instructed her son", Yue denounces the pirate chief Yang Yao (杨幺) and passes on {{a chance to become}} a general in his army. Yue Fei's mother then tells her son, [...] "I, your mother, saw that you did not accept recruitment of the rebellious traitor, and that you willingly endure poverty and are not tempted by wealth and status ... But I fear that after my death, there may be some unworthy creature who will entice you ... For these reason ... I want to tattoo on your back the four characters 'Utmost', 'Loyalty', 'Serve' and 'Nation' ... The Lady picked up the brush and wrote out on his spine the four characters for 'serving the nation with the utmost loyalty' ... she bit <b>her</b> <b>teeth,</b> <b>and</b> started pricking. Having finished, she painted the characters with ink mixed with vinegar so that the colour would never fade." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lewis Corner of Digital Spy {{gave the}} song a {{positive}} review stating: [...] "Truth be told, it's quite refreshing {{for an artist}} to embrace their perceived public image, but the joke is really on us. Why? Because it's Cher Lloyd who has the last laugh with another hit on her hands." [...] X. Alexander of Idolator said [...] "Instead of blasting us with that 'Swagger Jagger', she's coming at us with the uber-catchy 'Want U Back' — a good choice, since we haven't {{been able to get}} it out of our heads since we first heard it." [...] Virgin Media's Matthew Horton wrote that the song has [...] "dynamic catchy bounce." [...] David Griffiths from 4Music praised the track, writing: [...] "It might not sound a million miles away from Miley Cyrus' 'Party in the USA', but it's got Cher's stamp all over it. From her dead pan delivery ('Please, this ain't even jealousy, she ain't got nothin' on me') to her screams of frustration peppered throughout the track, this has the potential to be an enormous global hit." [...] Bradley Stern from [...] "MuuMuse" [...] commented: [...] "It is one of the album’s catchiest, cutest moments–even if Lloyd’s gritting <b>her</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>and</b> clenching her fists with rage." [...] He further wrote: ...|$|E
2500|$|X-Ray Spex's other {{distinctive}} musical element was Poly Styrene's voice, {{which has}} been variously described as [...] "effervescently discordant" [...] and [...] "powerful enough to drill holes through sheet metal". As Mari Elliot, Poly had released a reggae single for GTO Records in 1976, [...] "Silly Billy", which had not charted. Born in 1957 in Bromley, Kent, of both Somali and British parentage, Poly Styrene became the group's public face, and {{remains one of the}} most memorable front-women to emerge from the punk movement. Unorthodox in appearance, she wore thick braces on <b>her</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>and</b> once stated that [...] "I said that I wasn't a sex symbol and that if anybody tried to make me one I'd shave my head tomorrow". She later actually did at Johnny Rotten's flat prior to a concert at Victoria Park. Mark Paytress recounts in the liner notes for the 2002 compilation, The Anthology, that Jah Wobble, Rotten's longtime friend and bassist for his post-punk venture PiL, once described Styrene as a [...] "strange girl who often talked of hallucinating. She freaked John out." [...] Rotten, known more for his outspoken dislikes and disdain than for praise and admiration, said of X-Ray Spex in a retrospective punk documentary, [...] "Them, they came out with a sound and attitude and a whole energy—it was just not relating to anything around it—superb." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{her stay}} on Celebrity Big Brother 5, Shetty {{was the target}} of racism and {{bullying}} by other housemates, chiefly by Jade Goody, Jo O'Meara and Danielle Lloyd. After correcting Goody's mother, who mispronounced Shetty's name as 'Shiwpa', Shetty was mocked for her Indian accent and was branded [...] "The Indian" [...] and was referred to as a [...] "dog" [...] by Lloyd. Referring to Shetty, O'Meara generalised that all Indians were thin because they were [...] "sick all the time" [...] as a result of undercooking their food, following their belief that Shetty had undercooked a chicken, which gave O'Meara diarrhoea. Lloyd also mentioned that she disliked Shetty touching her food because she did not [...] "know where her hands have been". Lloyd, O'Meara and Goody repeatedly maintained a belief that Shetty was [...] "fake", and [...] "a mole". After Shetty attempted to dispose of the left-over chicken soup down the toilet and caused a blockage, housemate Jack Tweed suggested that she should pick the bones out with <b>her</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>and</b> allegedly referred to her as a [...] "fucking Paki", although show producers denied this and stated that the word used was [...] "cunt". During a fierce argument, Goody told Shetty that she needed to [...] "spend a day in the slums", although the media falsely reported this as [...] "go back to the slums". Claiming that she did not know Shilpa's surname, Goody referred to her as [...] "Shilpa Fuckawallah", [...] "Shilpa Daroopa", and [...] "Shilpa Poppadom", later claiming that they were non-racist references to Indian food. Lloyd had opined that Shetty's English-speaking skills were lacking and said she should [...] "fuck off home".|$|E
