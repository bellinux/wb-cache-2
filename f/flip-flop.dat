5|$|It is {{possible}} to mimic this asymmetry in the laboratory in model bilayer systems. Certain types of very small artificial vesicle will automatically make themselves slightly asymmetric, although the mechanism by which this asymmetry is generated {{is very different from}} that in cells. By utilizing two different monolayers in Langmuir-Blodgett deposition or a combination of Langmuir-Blodgett and vesicle rupture deposition it is also possible to synthesize an asymmetric planar bilayer. This asymmetry may be lost over time as lipids in supported bilayers can be prone to <b>flip-flop.</b>|$|E
5|$|When Wilson {{proposed}} {{establishment of}} a League of Nations, with the League's charter part of the Treaty of Versailles, Taft expressed public support. He was {{out of step with}} his party, whose senators were not inclined to ratify the treaty. Taft's subsequent <b>flip-flop</b> on the issue of whether reservations to the treaty were necessary angered both sides, destroying any remaining influence he had with the Wilson administration, and causing some Republicans to call him a Wilson supporter and a traitor to his party. The Senate refused to ratify the Versailles pact.|$|E
5|$|Lipid {{asymmetry}} arises, {{at least}} in part, {{from the fact that}} most phospholipids are synthesised and initially inserted into the inner monolayer: those that constitute the outer monolayer are then transported from the inner monolayer by a class of enzymes called flippases. Other lipids, such as sphingomyelin, appear to be synthesised at the external leaflet. Flippases are members of a larger family of lipid transport molecules that also includes floppases, which transfer lipids in the opposite direction, and scramblases, which randomize lipid distribution across lipid bilayers (as in apoptotic cells). In any case, once lipid asymmetry is established, it does not normally dissipate quickly because spontaneous <b>flip-flop</b> of lipids between leaflets is extremely slow.|$|E

Now-a-days in IC's, the power consumed by clocking gradually takes a dominant part.. Power, Area, Performance has become a main issue in VLSI design. In previous designs they have performed a co-ordinate transformation to identify the <b>flip-flops</b> that can be merged and their legal regions. A combinational table is formed by that <b>flip-flops.</b> Finally they used hierarchical way to merge the <b>flip-flops.</b> Due to this design the power consumption can be reduced by replacing some <b>flip-flops</b> by fewer multi-bit <b>flip-flops.</b> We have proposed an single phase adiabatic clock in for further reduction of the power. In our design also first we will identify the mergeable <b>flip-flops,</b> build a combinational table from mergeable <b>flip-flops</b> and all the <b>flip-flops</b> are divided into sub regions to check whether they are working properly or not and finally these <b>flip-flops</b> are combined together, at this point we are giving an single phase adiabatic clock as input to those <b>flip-flops</b> for the reduction of power consumption and timing...|$|R
40|$|Level {{converting}} <b>flip-flops</b> {{are critical}} elements in dual-VDD design for level conversion at the interface from low supply to high supply regions. Level converting <b>flip-flops</b> also provide energy savings {{on the clock}} distribution network by using low-swing clock signals. We propose dual-edge triggered level converting <b>flip-flops</b> that provide data sampling and level converting functions at both rising and falling edges of a low-swing clock. Adding the dual-edge triggering feature to level converting <b>flip-flops,</b> the clock frequency can be reduced by half, resulting in 50 % power savings on the clock tree {{in addition to the}} savings due to low voltage swing clock. Moreover, the proposed <b>flip-flops</b> outperform the existing level converting <b>flip-flops</b> in terms of performance. The dual-edge triggering capability is achieved by using a dual pulse clock generator that generates short pulses at both rising and falling edges of the clock. Based on simulation results in a 0. 25 Pm CMOS technology, the proposed <b>flip-flops</b> exhibit up to 68 % delay reduction as compared to existing level converting <b>flip-flops.</b> 1...|$|R

The key questions here are to identify which {{parts of the brain}} are involved in sleep onset and what their mechanisms of action are. In humans and most animals sleep and wakefulness seems to follow an electronic <b>flip-flop</b> model i.e. both states are stable, but the intermediate states are not. Of course, unlike in the <b>flip-flop,</b> in the case of sleep, {{there seems to be a}} timer ticking away from the minute of waking so that after a certain period one must sleep, and in such a case even waking becomes an unstable state. The reverse may also be true to a lesser extent.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel test point insertion (TPI) method for a pseudo-random built-in self-test (BIST) {{to reduce the}} area overhead. Recently, a new TPI method for BISTs was proposed that tries to use functional <b>flip-flops</b> to drive control test points instead of adding extra dedicated <b>flip-flops</b> for driving control points.

25|$|A latch or a <b>flip-flop</b> is {{a circuit}} that has two stable states {{and can be}} used to store state information. They {{typically}} constructed using feedback that crosses over between two arms of the circuit, to provide the circuit with a state. The circuit can be made to change state by signals applied to one or more control inputs and will have one or two outputs. It is the basic storage element in sequential logic. Latches and flip-flops are fundamental building blocks of digital electronics systems used in computers, communications, and many other types of systems.|$|E

To address how a tray could right itself {{at the moment of}} impending tilt, Grieve, a first-time inventor with a university background in 'History of film and photography', developed a finger receiver attached to the bottom of a wait tray based on first-principle physics, load dispersal, and counter movement. In a closed position, the finger receiver lays flush with the bottom of the wait tray so that the tray can sit on the surface of a bar or table without wobbling and can be stacked onto other trays. When the device is open, two slots can be accessed into which a waitperson may secure their two inside fingers, similar to how a <b>flip-flop</b> structurally attaches itself between the toes of the foot to counter the large stresses place upon it. The Safetray product's arrangement creates a strong cantilever advantage for the waitperson to allow them additional control over torque caused by items placed in various locations around the tray.
