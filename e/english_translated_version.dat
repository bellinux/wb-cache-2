The tours were immensely popular, drawing crowds of people. The summer tours continued for years after their start, providing free, bilingual theater to different neighborhoods in New York City.

40|$|Jeffrey Gray’s Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (RST) {{represents}} {{one of the most influential}} biologically-based personality theories describing individual differences in approach and avoidance tendencies. The most prominent self-report inventory to measure individual differences in approach and avoidance behavior to date is the BIS/BAS scale by Carver & White (1994). As Gray & McNaughton (2000) revised the RST after its initial formulation in the 1970 / 80 s, and given the Carver & White measure is based on the initial conceptualization of RST, there is a growing need for self-report inventories measuring individual differences in the revised behavioral inhibition system (BIS), behavioral activation system (BAS) and the fight, flight, freezing system (FFFS). Therefore, in this paper we present a new questionnaire measuring individual differences in the revised constructs of the BIS, BAS and FFFS in N = 1814 participants (German sample). An <b>English</b> <b>translated</b> <b>version</b> of the new measure is also presented and tested in N = 299 English language participants. A large number of German participants (N = 1090) also filled in the BIS/BAS scales by Carver & White (1994) and the correlations between these measures are presented. Finally, this same subgroup of participants provided buccal swaps for the investigation of the arginine vasopressin receptor 1 a (AVPR 1 a) gene. Here, a functional genetic polymorphism (rs 11174811) on the AVPR 1 a gene was shown to be associated with individual differences in both the revised BIS and classic BIS dimensions...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze the {{semantic}} analysis of conjunctions in the translation of a Malay-English novel. This study focuses on looking at cohesion ties specifically conjunctions used in the selected Malay literary text, Badai Semalam and its <b>English</b> <b>translated</b> <b>version,</b> Storms of Yesterday. The objectives of this study are (i) to identify the types of conjunctions used in sentences in translating the Malay novel, Badai Semalam into the English novel, Storms of Yesterday (ii) to find out the similarities and differences of semantic features of the Malay conjunctions into the English translation (iii) to determine the types of shifts in the level of explicitness and shifts in text meaning that might occur in the English translation. The study will employ Halliday and Hasan’s Taxonomy of Cohesion (1976) which emphasizes on conjunctions of four semantic areas (additive, adversative, causal and temporal) with the conjunctions in Malay language. In addition, Componential Analysis by Katz and Fodor (1963) will also be used to determine the semantic features of conjunctions whether the conjunctions used in Malay and English are similar or different. Blum Kulka’s shifts of Cohesion (1986) will be used to examine the types of shifts in the level of explicitness and text meaning that might occur. A pilot study was done earlier to require a comprehensive result before it is written completely. The discussions on the findings are presented from the excerpts of both novels and analyzed thoroughly. The findings reveal that some Malay and English conjunctions are related, overlapping and different. Interestingly, the results of the study also found that some Malay conjunctions are considered as prepositions and pronouns in English, thus indicates the frequent occurrences of explicit shifts...|$|E
