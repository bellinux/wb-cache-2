50|$|A {{projector}} or <b>image</b> <b>projector</b> is {{an optical}} device that projects an image (or moving images) onto a surface, commonly a projection screen. Most projectors create an image by shining a light {{through a small}} transparent lens, but some newer types of projectors can project the image directly, by using lasers. A virtual retinal display, or retinal projector, is a projector that projects an image directly on the retina instead of using an external projection screen.|$|E
50|$|The most {{powerful}} <b>image</b> <b>projectors</b> {{in the world}} are built by the company XL Productions. These one of a kind <b>image</b> <b>projectors</b> utilize large format lenses designed for Cold War surveillance systems, such as the U2 spy plane, and use other advanced optical systems and techniques to achieve image sizes and brightness levels far beyond that which is capable with commercially available projectors. XL Productions has presented imagery for events like the Olympics, the Super Bowl and other special productions. In 2000, XL Productions achieved projected image sizes as much as one mile across on Sugarloaf Mountain in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.|$|R

50|$|A {{handheld}} projector (also {{known as}} a pocket projector, mobile projector, pico projector or mini beamer) is technology that applies {{the use of an}} <b>image</b> <b>projector</b> in a handheld device. It is a response to the emergence/development of compact portable devices such as mobile phones, personal digital assistants, and digital cameras, which have sufficient storage capacity to handle presentation materials but little space to accommodate an attached display screen. Handheld projectors involve miniaturized hardware and software that can project digital images onto any nearby viewing surface.|$|E
50|$|In 2011, Sony {{launched}} its HDR-PJ range of HD camcorders: the HDR-PJ10, 30 and 50. Known as Handycams, {{they were the}} first camcorders to incorporate a small <b>image</b> <b>projector</b> {{on the side of the}} unit. This feature allows a group of viewers to watch video without a television, a full-size projector or a computer. These camcorders were a huge success and Sony subsequently released further models in this range. Sony's current 2014 line up comprises the HDR-PJ240, HDR-PJ330 (entry level models), HDR-PJ530 (mid-range model) and the HDR-PJ810 (top of the range). Specifications vary by model.|$|E

Combiners may have special coatings that reflect the monochromatic light projected onto it from the projector unit while allowing all other wavelengths of light to pass through.

The first two conditions are easy {{to be satisfied with}} available camera calibration algorithm [4],[18] and well-developed image processing technique [19],[20]. However, the latter two are much more difficult to be achieved. Furthermore, since the projector cannot ‘capture’ like a camera, how to determine the corresponding pixel point on the <b>projector’s</b> <b>image</b> plane is a challenge. If the pixel point on the <b>projector’s</b> <b>image</b> plane is biased, as Figure  2 shows, the measurement error will be enlarged in a short baseline arranged Pro-Cam system.|$|R
50|$|The magic lantern, {{also known}} by its Latin name lanterna magica, is an early type of <b>image</b> <b>projector</b> {{employing}} pictures on sheets of glass (originally painted, but later also printed or as photographic plates), a lens, and a bright light source. It was mostly developed in the 17th century and commonly used for entertainment purposes. It was increasingly applied to educational purposes during the 19th century and was in wide use until the mid-20th century, when a smaller-format version for photographs on film, marketed and commonly known as a slide projector, superseded it.|$|E

50|$|A video {{projector}} is an <b>image</b> <b>projector</b> that receives a video signal and projects the corresponding image on a projection screen using a lens system. All {{video projector}}s use {{a very bright}} light to project the image, and most modern ones can correct any curves, blurriness, and other inconsistencies through manual settings. Video projectors are used for many applications such as conference room presentations, classroom training, and concerts. In schools and other educational settings, they are sometimes connected to an interactive whiteboard. In the late 20th century they were commonplace in home cinema but later lost market share to large LCD television screens.|$|E

Most governments have their own space programs. Nearly 20% of Earth population works is in some way working in a space-related industry.

5000|$|Several {{scholars}} and inventors, like Giovanni Fontana (circa 1420), Leonardo da Vinci (circa 1515) and Cornelis Drebbel (1608) possibly had early <b>image</b> <b>projectors</b> before {{the invention of}} the Magic Lantern. Athanasius Kircher's 1645 first edition of Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae included a description of his forerunner to the magic lantern: the [...] "Steganographic Mirror". This was a primitive projection system with a focusing lens and text or pictures painted on a concave mirror reflecting sunlight, mostly intended for long distance communication. Kircher also suggested projecting live flies and shadow puppets {{from the surface of the}} mirror. The book was widely distributed and may have offered some inspiration for Christiaan Huygens' invention of the magic lantern in 1659.|$|R
50|$|Pépin {{has also}} been {{credited}} with playing {{a big part in}} the invention of the water projection screen, a specialised fountain nozzle that directs a large 'fan-spray' of water in the air, on which <b>images</b> from <b>projectors</b> and lasers can be shone on.|$|R
50|$|Batman Returns was {{the first}} film to use Dolby Digital {{technology}} when it premiered in theaters {{in the summer of}} 1992. Dolby Digital cinema soundtracks are optically recorded on a 35 mm release print using sequential data blocks placed between every perforation hole on the sound track side of the film. A constant bit rate of 320 kbit/s is used. A charge-coupled device (CCD) scanner in the <b>image</b> <b>projector</b> picks up a scanned video image of this area, and a processor correlates the image area and extracts the digital data as an AC-3 bitstream. The data is then decoded into a 5.1 channel audio source. All film prints with Dolby Digital data also have Dolby Stereo analogue soundtracks using Dolby SR noise reduction and such prints are known as Dolby SR-D prints. The analogue soundtrack provides a fall-back option in case of damage to the data area or failure of the digital decoding; it also provides compatibility with projectors not equipped with digital soundheads. Almost all current release cinema prints are of this type and may also include SDDS data and a timecode track to synchronize CD-ROMs carrying DTS soundtracks.|$|E

The ORCA instrument measured the projected scene, and we compared the ORCA measured scene to the projected scene, in the spatial and spectral domains, in the near infrared spectral region. The results show reasonable agreement between the measured and projected scenes, and serve to provide confidence that the system was working as expected.
