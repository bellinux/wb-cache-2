5000|$|Rimmer grew up {{in poverty}} in mining and lumber camps in {{northern}} California. He was forced to quit school before completion of the third grade, and thereafter worked {{in a range of}} manual labouring roles, whilst receiving some informal education from a mining engineer, heavily slanted towards the sciences. At 19, he joined the US Army, serving in the artillery and gaining some fame as a boxer. After the military, he spent two terms at a small homeopathic medical school, supporting himself as a prizefighter, before being forced to drop out before completing the third term (and gaining a qualification), due to lack of financial resources. It was here that he obtained much of his understanding of science, of which he bragged that he had accumulated a vocabulary of [...] "double jointed, twelve cylinder, <b>knee-action</b> words".|$|E
5000|$|A minor face {{lift and}} small trim {{variations}} {{were the main}} Cadillac styling news in 1951. Miniature eggcrate grilles were set into the out-board grille extension panels below the headlights. Larger, bullet shaped style bumper guards were used. The features list included handbrake, warning lamp; key start ignition; steering column cover; Delco-Remy generator; <b>knee-action</b> front suspension; directionals; mechanical fuel pump; dual downdraft carburetor; slipper-type pistons; rubber engine mountings; oversize brakes; Super Cushion tires; one-piece windshield; intake silencer; 160-hp engine; oil bath air cleaner; equalized manifolding; automatic choke and luxury appointments. On the dashboard [...] "idiot lights" [...] were used to monitor oil pressure and electrical charge rate instead of gauges. The smaller body was once again used on the 61s and again identified {{by the lack of}} chrome underscores. However a new medallion appeared on the rear roof pillar of the Series 61, above the upper beltline molding.|$|E
