5|$|With the {{discovery}} {{during the latter}} half of the 20th century of more objects within the Solar System and large objects around other stars, disputes arose over what should constitute a planet.

5000|$|The second {{derivative}} {{test for}} functions {{of one and}} two variables is simple.

In two variables, the determinant can be used, because the determinant {{is the product of}} the eigenvalues. <b>If</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> positive then the eigenvalues are both positive, or both negative. <b>If</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> negative then the two eigenvalues have different signs. <b>If</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> zero, then the second derivative test is inconclusive.|$|R

5|$|Shepard pursues Saren {{through the}} Conduit, {{arriving}} at the Citadel as it comes under attack by Sovereign and geth forces. Confronting Saren, Shepard can kill him or convince him to rebel, which results in Saren committing suicide. As a human Systems Alliance fleet masses to counterattack, Shepard must either save the Council and risk heavy casualties or abandon them to pursue Sovereign. Sovereign then reanimates Saren's corpse to attack Shepard, while simultaneously fighting off the Alliance. Eventually, humanity prevails, and Saren's corpse is destroyed while Sovereign is dispatched by the Normandy. Humanity will then join the Council, either as a member <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> saved or as its new leader <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> left to perish. Regardless, Shepard nominates either Anderson or Udina to this new leadership position before {{turning away from the}} proceedings, vowing to end the Reaper threat.|$|E

5|$|The {{lifestyle}} of Archaeopteryx {{is difficult to}} reconstruct {{and there are several}} theories regarding it. Some researchers suggest that it was primarily adapted to life on the ground, while other researchers suggest that it was principally arboreal. The absence of trees does not preclude Archaeopteryx from an arboreal lifestyle, as several species of bird live exclusively in low shrubs. Various aspects of the morphology of Archaeopteryx point to either an arboreal or ground existence, including the length of its legs and the elongation in its feet; some authorities consider it likely to have been a generalist capable of feeding in both shrubs and open ground, as well as along the shores of the lagoon. It most likely hunted small prey, seizing it with its jaws <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> small enough, or with its claws <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> larger.|$|E
5|$|After {{reaching}} peak intensity, Frances began tracking over cooler SST's, which gradually {{weakened the}} storm. The eye featured became indistinct and by late on October 25, Frances was downgraded to a tropical storm.

One sailor was reported missing, however, it is unknown <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{as a result of}} Frances. In addition, one person on a sailboat suffered injuries during an encounter with Frances. On land, Frances caused minimal impact, limited to light rainfall across Newfoundland.|$|E

In contrast, South Vietnamese forces within the vicinity of Đồng Xoài were severely depleted, and did not have sufficient strength to defeat the Viet Cong. Furthermore, there was only one remaining battalion in South Vietnam’s strategic reserve, and it {{may not be enough to}} drive the Communist out from the area <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> committed.|$|E

5|$|Arrowslits, also {{commonly}} called loopholes, were narrow vertical openings in defensive walls which allowed arrows or crossbow bolts {{to be fired}} on attackers. The narrow slits were intended to protect the defender by providing a very small target, but {{the size of the}} opening could also impede the defender <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> too small. A smaller horizontal opening could be added to give an archer a better view for aiming. Sometimes a sally port was included; this could allow the garrison to leave the castle and engage besieging forces. It was usual for the latrines to empty down the external walls of a castle and into the surrounding ditch.|$|E
