[...] "One needn't agree with <b>every</b> <b>last</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Baker's views to conclude that, at this time, the Republican nominee would provide the best counterpoint to the instincts of an overwhelmingly Democratic Legislature," [...] the endorsement reads. The newspaper also supported Baker because it claimed Baker would be the better candidate to [...] "consolidate" [...] outgoing Democratic Gov. Deval Patrick's legacy on reforms tied to education, health care and public transportation.|$|E

500|$|Contrary to speculation, Henderson's {{refusal to}} officially retire {{had not been}} delaying his {{eligibility}} for Hall of Fame induction. Since the 1970s, the five-year waiting period {{has been based on}} major league service only. Henderson was elected as part of the 2009 Hall of Fame vote, in his first appearance on the ballot. At a press conference two days after his election, the 50-year-old Henderson told reporters, [...] "I believe today, and people say I’m crazy, but if you gave me as many at-bats that you would give the runners out there today, I would outsteal <b>every</b> <b>last</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them... they can always ring my phone and I'll come on down and help their ballclub, that's how much I love the game." ...|$|E

2500|$|By {{the time}} the 2008 primary season began, McCain's media {{coverage}} had shifted and he was now viewed as a [...] "comeback" [...] story. In addition, McCain returned to his long-standing practice of granting almost unlimited media access to him on this bus; this {{as well as the}} notion that he engages in [...] "straight talk" [...] free of political calculation gave him a positive personal sentiment in the press. Reflecting this feeling, MSNBC's Joe Scarborough joked of the media, [...] "I think <b>every</b> <b>last</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them would move to Massachusetts and marry John McCain if they could." [...] Measurements by the University of Navarra indicated that throughout January 2008, McCain's global media attention surged from being a distant third among Republican candidates to being the equal of Romney and Huckabee.|$|E

The March 1993 issue advised, [...] "A cockroach gives birth to a cockroach... the history of Rwanda shows us clearly that a Tutsi always stays exactly the same, that he has never changed." [...] Kangura further asserted that some who said they were Hutus were in fact Tutsis and that these individuals could be recognized because they [...] "lacked commitment to the Hutu cause" [...] and that the RPF had launched its 1990 invasion in order to reestablish the Tutsi monarchy and enslave the Hutus.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first record}} of Hasids {{referring}} to Schneerson in messianic terms was in 1965.

Our own rule was to hit a man as soon as he opened his mouth--hit him hard, hit him with anything. A broom-handle, end-on, in the face, had a very sobering effect. But that was not all. Such a man must be made an example of; so the next rule was to wade right in and follow him up. Of course, one was sure that every hall-man in sight would come on the run to join in the chastisement; for this also was a rule. Whenever any hall-man was in trouble with a prisoner, the duty of any other hall-man who happened to be around was to lend a fist. Never mind the merits of the case--wade in and hit, and hit with anything; in short, lay the man out.|$|E
