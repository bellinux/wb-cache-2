40|$|Translating each of a UNIX {{software}} system 2 ̆ 7 s source <b>files</b> into an object <b>file,</b> and linking the object <b>files</b> into an executable <b>file,</b> {{can be a}} time-consuming process. Object <b>file</b> generation accounts {{for most of this}} time. Tools that recognize and avoid unnecessary object <b>file</b> regeneration are very popular. Many such tools are named MAKE. A {{software system}} often contains a parameter <b>file.</b> A parameter <b>file</b> is a source <b>file,</b> textually included by every other source <b>file,</b> which defines macros shared by multiple source <b>files.</b> Each object <b>file</b> depends on the parameter <b>file,</b> according to <b>file</b> dependencies. MAKE-like tools only understand <b>file</b> dependencies. So, when a software developer changes a macro in a parameter <b>file,</b> every object <b>file</b> is regenerated, regardless of whether its corresponding source <b>file</b> actually refers to the changed macro.

40|$|From its inception, UNIX {{has been}} built around two {{fundamental}} entities: processes and <b>files.</b> In this chapter, {{we look at the}} implementation of <b>files</b> in Solaris and discuss the framework for <b>file</b> systems. 14. 1 <b>File</b> System Framework Solaris OS includes a framework, the virtual <b>file</b> system framework, under which multiple <b>file</b> system types are implemented. Earlier implementations of UNIX used a single <b>file</b> system type for all of the mounted <b>file</b> systems, typically, the UFS <b>file</b> system from BSD UNIX. The virtual <b>file</b> system framework was developed to allow Sun’s distributed computing <b>file</b> system (NFS) to coexist with the UFS <b>file</b> system in SunOS 2. 0; it became a standard part of System V in SVR 4 and Solaris OS. We can categorize Solaris <b>file</b> systems into the following types: Storage-based. Regular <b>file</b> systems that provide facilities for persistent storage and management of data. The Solaris UFS and PC/DOS <b>file</b> systems are examples. Network <b>file</b> systems. <b>File</b> systems that provide <b>files</b> that are accessible in a local directory structure but are stored on a remote network server; for example, NFS. Pseudo <b>file</b> systems. <b>File</b> systems that present various abstractions as <b>files</b> in a <b>file</b> system. The /proc pseudo <b>file</b> system represents the address space of a process as a series of <b>files.</b> 657 658 Chapter 14 <b>File</b> System Framework The framework provides a single set of well-defined interfaces that are <b>file</b> system independent; the implementation details of each <b>file</b> system are hidden behind these interfaces. Two key objects represent these interfaces: the virtual <b>file,</b> or vnode, and the virtual <b>file</b> system, or vfs objects. The vnode interfaces implement file-related functions, and the vfs interfaces implement <b>file</b> system management functions. The vnode and vfs interfaces direct functions to specific <b>file</b> systems, {{depending on the type of}} <b>file</b> system being operated on. Figure 14. 1 shows the <b>file</b> system layers. File-related functions are initiated through a system call or from another kernel subsystem and are directed to the appropriate <b>file</b> system by the vnode/vfs layer...|$|R

50|$|On <b>file</b> systems without forks, one may instead use {{multiple}} separate <b>files</b> {{that are}} associated with each other, particularly sidecar <b>files</b> for metadata. However, the connection between these <b>files</b> is not automatically preserved by the <b>file</b> system, and must instead be handled by each program that works on <b>files.</b> Another alternative is a container <b>file,</b> which stores additional data within a given <b>file</b> format, or an archive <b>file,</b> which allows storing several <b>files</b> and metadata within a <b>file</b> (within a single fork). This requires that programs process the container <b>file</b> or archive <b>file,</b> rather than the <b>file</b> system handling forks. These alternatives require additional work by programs using the data, but benefit from portability to <b>file</b> systems that do not support forks.|$|R
50|$|Rather than storing data separately, it can {{be stored}} {{as part of the}} main <b>file.</b> This is {{particularly}} done for container <b>files,</b> which allow certain types of data to be stored in them. Instead of separate <b>files</b> on the <b>file</b> system, multiple <b>files</b> can be combined into an archive <b>file,</b> which keeps them together, but requires that software processes the archive <b>file,</b> rather than individual <b>files.</b> This is a generic solution, as archive <b>files</b> can contain arbitrary <b>files</b> from the <b>file</b> system.|$|R
