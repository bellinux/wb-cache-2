5|$|Another major {{difference}} between Tarbosaurus and its North American relatives was <b>its</b> <b>more</b> rigid mandible (lower jaw). While many theropods, including North American tyrannosaurids, had some degree of flexibility between the bones {{in the rear of}} the mandible and the dentary in the front, Tarbosaurus had a locking mechanism formed from a ridge on the surface of the angular, which articulated with a square process on the rear of the dentary.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{low number}} of subfossil finds, Hadropithecus {{is thought to have}} been rare, and it died out sooner than its sister taxon, Archaeolemur. Both {{disappeared}} shortly after the arrival of humans to the island, but being a large, specialized, terrestrial grazer, Hadropithecus would have faced more pressure from domestic livestock, introduced pigs, and spreading human populations than <b>its</b> <b>more</b> generalized cousin. The last known record was radiocarbon dated to around 444–772 CE.|$|E

5|$|Greek-style homes {{gave way}} to Gothic Revival in the 1830s, which {{emphasized}} pointed arches, steep gable roofs, towers and tracer-lead windows.

5|$|In {{collections}} {{which contain}} fossils, high humidity can also affect pyrite (or <b>its</b> <b>more</b> reactive polymorph marcasite) (iron sulphide) fossils {{in a somewhat}} similar condition, which is known as pyrite disease.

Metalloids are sometimes called semimetals, a practice that has been discouraged, as the term semimetal has a different meaning in physics than in chemistry. In physics it more specifically refers to the electronic band structure of a substance.|$|E
5|$|A {{relatively}} small swallow, the nominate subspecies has bronze upperparts and bronze {{sides of the}} head. The ears and lores are duller and the forehead area is more green than bronze. The shoulders, back, rump, and uppertail-coverts are, on the other hand, a coppery-bronze colour. The lesser and median coverts are more coppery, with the greater and primary-wing-coverts being more of a dusky green. The primaries, secondaries, and tail are a dusky bronze-green. The underparts are mostly white. The legs, feet, and irides are dark brown, and the bill is black. The female is similar but with a mottled grey-brown breast and occasionally throat and undertail-coverts. The juvenile is also mottled-grey brown, in addition to it being duller overall. The extant subspecies, T. e. sclateri, is primarily differentiated by <b>its</b> <b>more</b> deeply forked tail, blue-green forehead and uppertail-coverts, and blue-black wings and tail.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the Russo-Japanese War the Imperial Russian Navy was in a {{state of}} confusion.

The Navy took quite some time to absorb the design lessons from the war while the government reformed the Naval Ministry and forced many of <b>its</b> <b>more</b> conservative officers to retire. It conducted a design contest for a dreadnought in 1906, but the Duma refused to authorize it, preferring to spend the money on rebuilding the Army.|$|E

5|$|Among big-budget auteurs, Michael Mann {{has worked}} {{frequently}} in a neo-noir mode, with {{such films as}} Thief (1981) and Heat (1995) and the TV series Miami Vice (1984–89) and Crime Story (1986–88). Mann's output exemplifies a primary strain of neo-noir, in which classic themes and tropes are revisited in a contemporary setting with an up-to-date visual style and rock- or hip hop–based musical soundtrack. Like Chinatown, <b>its</b> <b>more</b> complex predecessor, Curtis Hanson's Oscar-winning L.A. Confidential (1997), based on the James Ellroy novel, demonstrates an opposite tendency—the deliberately retro film noir; its tale of corrupt cops and femmes fatales is seemingly lifted straight from a film of 1953, {{the year in which}} it is set. Director David Fincher followed the immensely successful neo-noir Seven (1995) with a film that developed into a cult favorite after its original, disappointing release: Fight Club (1999) is a sui generis mix of noir aesthetic, perverse comedy, speculative content, and satiric intent.|$|E

A bill supporting the creation of the Township of Teaneck was put through the New Jersey General Assembly on February 18, 1895, and the New Jersey Senate on the next day. Governor of New Jersey George Werts signed the bill into law, and Teaneck was an independent municipality.|$|E
5|$|Boron is a {{chemical}} element with symbolB and atomic number5.

5|$|Cumulus {{clouds are}} often {{precursors}} of {{other types of}} cloud, such as cumulonimbus, when influenced by weather factors such as instability, moisture, and temperature gradient. Normally, cumulus clouds produce little or no precipitation, but they can grow into the precipitation-bearing congestus or cumulonimbus clouds. Cumulus clouds can be formed from water vapor, supercooled water droplets, or ice crystals, depending upon the ambient temperature. They come in many distinct subforms, and generally cool the earth by reflecting the incoming solar radiation. Cumulus clouds are part of the larger category of free-convective cumuliform clouds, which include cumulonimbus clouds. The latter genus-type is sometimes categorized separately as cumulonimbiform due to <b>its</b> <b>more</b> complex structure that often includes a cirriform or anvil top. There are also cumuliform clouds of limited convection that comprise stratocumulus (low-), altocumulus (middle-étage) and cirrocumulus. (high-étage). These last three genus-types are sometimes classified separately as stratocumuliform.|$|E
5|$|During World WarI, the palace, {{then the}} home of King GeorgeV and Queen Mary, escaped unscathed. <b>Its</b> <b>more</b> {{valuable}} contents were evacuated to Windsor but the royal family remained in situ. The King imposed rationing at the palace, much {{to the dismay of}} his guests and household. To the King's later regret, David Lloyd George persuaded him to go further by ostentatiously locking the wine cellars and refraining from alcohol, to set a good example to the supposedly inebriated working class. The workers continued to imbibe and the King was left unhappy at his enforced abstinence. In 1938, the north-west pavilion, designed by Nash as a conservatory, was converted into a swimming pool.|$|E

Harrya atriceps is a closely related rare species from Costa Rica. In contrast to <b>its</b> <b>more</b> common relative, it lacks reddish color in its stipe scabers and has a black cap, although it has a similar yellow stipe base.|$|E
