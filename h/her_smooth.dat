25|$|In 1958 Patsy Burt {{made the}} {{step up to}} single-seat Formula racing, and bought a Cooper T43. Although she {{continued}} to compete in circuit races, Burt won her first events in hillclimb competitions, including taking {{first place in the}} Stapleford National Hillclimb. From 1959 she decided to concentrate solely on the sprint and hillclimb events. <b>Her</b> <b>smooth,</b> precise driving style was ideally suited to these single-run events where a mistake, unlike in a multiple-lap circuit race, could not be cancelled out by better driving later in the event. In addition to the little Cooper — painted in her own shade of dark powder-blue, which came to be known by others as Burt blue, with white trim — Patsy Burt also raced a 1500cc Porsche RS in 1961, becoming the first British competitor ever to complete a full season in the European Mountain Championship.|$|E

On the 2014 [...] tour, the song was performed after [...] "Paparazzi". Gaga perched atop a silver chair shaped like a hand, and sang the song. Kelly's verses were removed from the live rendition.

2500|$|Black writer, Arthur Todd, {{described}} her as [...] "one {{of our national}} treasures." [...] Regarding her impact and effect he wrote: [...] "The rise of American Negro dance commenced ... when Katherine Dunham and her company skyrocketed into the Windsor Theater in New York, from Chicago in 1940, and made an indelible stamp on the dance world... Miss Dunham opened the doors that made possible the rapid upswing of this dance for the present generation." [...] "What Dunham gave modern dance was a coherent lexicon of African and Caribbean styles of movement—a flexible torso and spine, articulated pelvis and isolation of the limbs, a polyrhythmic strategy of moving—which she integrated with techniques of ballet and modern dance." [...] "Her mastery of body movement was considered 'phenomenal.' She was hailed for <b>her</b> <b>smooth</b> and fluent choreography and dominated a stage with what {{has been described as}} 'an unmitigating radiant force providing beauty with a feminine touch full of variety and nuance." ...|$|E
