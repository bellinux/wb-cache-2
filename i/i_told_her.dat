I'm actually not familiar with her work, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> this flat-out. She sent a couple of films and I still haven't seen them... But no matter. I don't really go by that. I go by other things. I go by scripts. I go with what I think I can do with a character and if I feel a kinetic energy with someone and I feel we can uplift and challenge each other.|$|E
500|$|Peggy {{has been}} spoofed in several programmes, {{including}} the ITV cartoon sketch show 2DTV, and Harry Hill's TV Burp. In the BBC's Big Impression, impressionist Ronni Ancona performs as Peggy, shuffling around {{on her knees}} to exaggerate Barbara Windsor's petite height, and regularly using the catchphrase [...] "Get outta my pub!" [...] Impressionist Jan Ravens has spoofed her in the BBC's Dead Ringers, also mimicking her cheeky laugh. Commenting on Ancona's impersonation, Windsor has said: [...] "she does me brilliantly. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> {{it was a great}} compliment. She made me realise my little hands wave around a lot." ...|$|E
500|$|She got {{in touch}} with book {{publisher}} Judith Regan who agreed to help her publish the book after a brief phone call, without first receiving a draft of the work. In an interview with Los Angeles Magazine, Dickinson recalled the process of pitching her book to Regan: [...] "I got a book deal without even turning in one shred of a writing sample. I was having an invincible moment. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> how difficult it was for me growing up with an abusive father, how when I went to New York to become a model I was rejected for a year for being 'too ethnic.' Judith said, 'Okay, I'm in.'" ...|$|E

I did many things as a [...] Muslim that I'm sorry for now. I was a zombie thenlike all [...] MuslimsI was hypnotized, pointed in a certain direction and told to march.

So when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> my {{character}} {{was going to be}} mixed up with Adam, she went, 'Oh! He is so good, but so bad'". Egan said that her mother [...] "told me he was a great character, but an evil one, so I was really excited. And now knowing Michael, it has been so much fun." [...] She said that [...] "everyone seems to think we have good on-screen chemistry" [...] and that [...] "it's an interesting energy between Chelsea and Adam being the [...] "bad guys" [...] in town."

500|$|As Edward was {{unmarried}} {{and had no}} children, Albert was {{the heir}} presumptive to the throne. Less than a year later, on 11 December 1936, Edward abdicated in order to marry his mistress, Wallis Simpson, who was divorced from her first husband and divorcing her second. Edward had been advised by British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin {{that he could not}} remain king and marry a divorced woman with two living ex-husbands. Edward chose abdication in preference to abandoning his marriage plans. Thus Albert became king, a position he was reluctant to accept. The day before the abdication, he went to London to see his mother, Queen Mary. He wrote in his diary, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> what had happened, I broke down and sobbed like a child." ...|$|E

500|$|In early August 2010, Entertainment Weekly {{reported}} that Eric the Actor, from The Howard Stern Show, had been cast {{for a small}} role in the new season's second episode. Deaf actor Russell Harvard portrayed Joe, {{a man who is}} able to survive the box being opened only to be killed by Fauxlivia. Harvard later commented in an interview, [...] "Fringe was so much fun and not even stressful compared to [...] Hamill. It was very fast and rapid. Playing the dead guy was very easy. Working with Anna Torv was so much fun, she is a great, great actress and very sweet. I did not think she would be that kind of person." [...] He continued, [...] "There was a stunt which {{she did not want to}} do herself, but <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> 'You want to be authentic so I want you to pull me,' so she obliged. It was a great experience and so much fun and I wish I could have stayed on the show for a long time." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)" [...] {{was directed by}} Lohan in Chelsea, Manhattan, New York City, and references her father Michael's alcoholism and alleged domestic abuse. Tommy Mottola, head of Casablanca, revealed {{that no one could}} direct the video better than Lindsay herself, who said to Lohan, [...] "'No one knows this song better than you, no one knows this situation better than you.' It's a lot to take on, but <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> she's ready, and we'll give her all the support she needs". Lohan said that the video's storefront setting was chosen because, in her words, [...] "my life is on display". Lohan also wanted to break a mirror during the bathroom scenes, because she wanted to show her real feelings in the video. Assistant director Jeb Bryan said to Lohan, [...] "This is real glass, Lindsay. We weren't prepared for you to break these things. [...] Do you want this slow motion?" [...] She responded, [...] "Regular frame will make it more violent. [...] I don't want it to be too pretty". The music video was first aired on MTV's Making the Video, and later released to iTunes Store on October 25, 2005.|$|E
500|$|Elena Pignatti, who had {{employed}} Morisi {{after she}} left the Mortaras in 1857—her words about Morisi's misconduct had formed part of the Mortaras' appeal to the Pope—testified that [...] "seven or eight years ago... a son of the Mortaras, whose name I don't know, became sick, and {{it was said that}} he was going to die. Around then, one morning... I ran into Morisi. Among the other things we talked about, she—without mentioning the child's illness—asked me, 'I've heard that if you baptise a Jewish child who's about to die he goes to Heaven and gets indulgence; isn't that right?' I don't remember what <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her,</b> but when the Mortara boy was kidnapped by order of the Dominican Father, I was sure that he must have been the one who was sick". Pignatti said that she had herself seen Edgardo during his illness, and Marianna sitting by the crib—"Since his mother was crying, and despaired for his life, I thought he was dying, also because of his appearance: his eyes were closed, and he was hardly moving." [...] She added that during the three months when Morisi worked for her in late 1857, the servant had been summoned to San Domenico four or five times, and had said that the inquisitor had promised her a dowry.|$|E

500|$|David Hill, 18, {{was asked}} to [...] "sit in" [...] at the house, and while there heard Dudson shout [...] "Shut up, you slag!" [...] in the back room. When he asked what was going on, Leigh had shown him Capper. He said: [...] "She {{had a sort of}} cloth over her face, from just above the eyebrows and {{covering}} her nose. She had a bit of dried blood on her lip. She had no hair." [...] Hill also said he had heard them talking about [...] "dentistry work. It was something about pulling her teeth out with a pair of pliers." [...] Later, he was left alone in the house with Capper, who pleaded with him to untie her. He said: [...] "She asked me if I could help but <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> I couldn't. I asked her who she was. She said her name was Suzanne. She asked me if I could untie her. I said I couldn't do anything." [...] He later claimed that he was too afraid of Leigh to intervene or raise the alarm, saying: [...] "I thought they would batter me. If I'd said [...] they'd all have got me, wouldn't they? I didn't know what to do. I was too shocked to do anything." [...] While Capper was being held in the house, Leigh and Dudson met up with her sister's fiance Paul Barlow to help him repair his car. Barlow said: [...] "They could have told me there and then. The door would have been kicked down and I would have got Suzanne out. I did not think they were capable of such savagery. Now all I want is ten minutes with them in a back room." ...|$|E
500|$|Flight {{attendant}} CeeCee Lyles {{called her}} husband at 09:47:57 and left him a message saying the plane had been hijacked. Marion Britton called her friend, Fred Fiumano, at 09:49:12. Fiumano recalled, [...] "she said, 'We're gonna. They're gonna kill us, you know, We're gonna die.' And <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her,</b> 'Don't worry, they hijacked the plane, they're gonna take you for a ride, you go to their country, and you come back. You stay there for vacation.' You don't know what to say—what are you gonna say? I kept on saying the same things, 'Be calm.' And she was crying and—you know—more or less crying and screaming and yelling." [...] Flight attendant Sandra Bradshaw called {{her husband at}} 09:50:04 and {{told him she was}} preparing scalding water to throw at the hijackers. Passenger Lauren Grandcolas called her husband twice, once before takeoff and once during the hijacking. He missed both of her calls. She then passed her phone to Honor Elizabeth Wainio. Wainio called her stepmother at 09:53:43 and concluded, four and a half minutes later, by saying, [...] "I have to go. They're breaking into the cockpit. I love you." [...] Jarrah dialed in the VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) frequency for the VOR navigational aid at Reagan National Airport at 09:55:11 to direct the plane toward Washington, D.C. Bradshaw, on the phone with her husband, said [...] "Everyone is running up to first class. I've got to go. Bye." [...] Beamer told Jefferson that the group was planning to [...] "jump on" [...] the hijackers and fly the plane into the ground before the hijackers' plan could be followed through. Beamer recited the Lord's Prayer and the 23rd Psalm with Jefferson, prompting others to join in. Beamer requested of Jefferson, [...] "If I don't make it, please call my family and let them know how much I love them." [...] After this, Jefferson heard muffled voices and Beamer clearly answering, [...] "Are you ready? Okay. Let's roll." [...] These were Beamer's last words to Jefferson.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for the remix of [...] "Up Out My Face" [...] {{was directed by}} Carey's husband, Nick Cannon. Minaj spoke about filming a video with Carey and how she {{did not believe that}} the video would ever be released: [...] "I didn’t even tell anyone I shot a video with Mariah, because I didn’t even believe. In the back of my mind, I felt like, ’This video is not gonna come out. There’s no way I’m gonna do a video with Mariah Carey before I even put out my album.’ Then, when it came out, I think it was the #1 video on YouTube in one day, something crazy like that." [...] It premiered simultaneously with the video for [...] "Angels Cry" [...] with Ne-Yo on Vevo on January 28, 2010. Carey and Minaj play different characters, include Barbie dolls who escape from their boxes, sexy nurses in matching outfits, two women in a nail salon and two divas shopping. Carey's doll box has [...] "She sings" [...] written on the front, while Minaj's say [...] "She raps". Cannon makes a cameo appearance in the video, which Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy thought was a reference to the 2002 film, Drumline. According to Anna Pickard of The Guardian, the escape from their packaging demonstrates a theme of being independent women and {{that they will not be}} restrained by men. Minaj spoke about the video in an interview for MTV News: [...] "A lot of times, more famous artists or more confident artists take from a younger artist but they’ll never include you in that. I feel like she liked the whole doll thing and she wanted to do it with me. But she said that: She said, ’Everybody’s gonna say 'she’s doing Nicki.' But <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her,</b> she’s always had a doll persona, like all that ’doll baby’ [...] So it goes perfect with Barbie and we had fun. That’s all that matters." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some of the {{controversy}} over this may be media driven. Rich Lowry, editor of National Review, reported in the magazine's blog that the BBC [...] "have been harassing me for days over March of the Penguins ... about what, I'm not sure. I think to see if I would say on air that penguins are God's instruments to pull America back from the hell-fire, or something like that.

2500|$|Previously, Bankhead had {{controlled}} the production by not {{showing up for}} rehearsal. Now, Myerberg could simply put Scott in Bankhead's place.

Describing her own experience with Bankhead, Scott recalled, [...] "She never spoke to me, except to bark out commands. Finally, one day, I'd had enough. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> to say 'please,' and after that she did." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, Raffaele Cutolo {{has always}} {{maintained}} that Rosetta {{knew nothing of}} his criminal activities and did only what he asked: [...] "Rosetta {{has never been a}} Camorrista...

[...] Nevertheless, it is clear that Cutolo had always wanted to maintain a male-only organization based on principles such as criminal fraternity and so could never be seen giving a role to his sister. It could be argued {{that he did not want}} to implicate her and therefore, always insisted that she was innocent.|$|E

2500|$|Her {{future husband}} Allan McKeown had {{reservations}} about her launching a music career and tried talking {{her out of}} it. “When I first met Miss Ullman, I was a TV producer, and I called her into my office in London and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> {{that she had a}} big career in comedy, and she said to me, ‘Well actually, I’m doing a record next week,’ and I said, ‘Now listen here Miss Ullman, if I know anything about show business, is that you shouldn’t get involved with singing.

[...] During the 1980s, Mayweather lived in the Hiram Square neighborhood of New Brunswick, New Jersey, where his mother had relatives. He later said, [...] "When I was about eight or nine, I lived in New Jersey with my mother and we were seven deep in one bedroom and sometimes we didn't have electricity. When people see what I have now, they have no idea of where I came from and how I didn't have anything growing up." ...|$|E
