Light company made biliverdin was dissolved in 5 % potassium hydroxide alcohol and was acidified at about pH 4. 6 with N/ 10 hydrochloric acid after 5 "s waterbath, and thus an <b>ether</b> <b>extractable</b> substance was obtained. This green colored <b>ether</b> <b>extractable</b> substance proved qualitative reaction for biliverdin and exhibited the absorption maximum at 700 and 375 mμ. in the glacial acetic acid. In the infrared absorption spectra of the <b>ether</b> <b>extractable</b> biliverdin, the following features were observed with that of L. Light company made biliverdin. 1) The OH, NH streching vibration (VOH, NH) was observed at 2. 90 and 3. 11 μ. 2) The C=O streching vibration of the carbonyl group ((v) C=O) was observed at 5. 83. μ. 3) The C=C streching vibration of the vinyl group ((v) C=C) was observed at about 6. 4 μ. 4) Absorption band due to conjugated double bond aromatic ring vibration was observed at about 6. 20 μ. In consequence, the <b>ether</b> <b>extractable</b> biliverdin provided the chemical structure of biliverdin which was established by H. Fisher and R. Lemberg. On the other hand, L.

The identification of these polymers and the amount of <b>extractable</b> <b>matter</b> on a garment with uniformity dyeing defects and on another one with irregularity seam defects are studied. Higher amounts of silicones were found in the defective areas. It was verified that infrared spectrometry is a useful technique for the simple and fast identification of silicones in aqueous or organic extracts of textile articles.

Data from 59 published experiments were re-analyzed using multivariate PLS modelling. Nitrogen mineralization was primarily related to the size of total and <b>extractable</b> organic <b>matter</b> fractions whereas variables reflecting soil texture and organic matter quality were less important. All EOM fractions reflected the soil organic matter content of the soil rather than a specific bioavailable fraction.

Both green and dry matter yields were increased with increasing nitrogen levels and delaying harvest. The increase in yield was mainly due to higher plant height, stem diameter and number of leaves plant - 1. The contents of crude protein, <b>ether</b> <b>extractable</b> fat and ash were increased with increased nitrogen levels and decreased with delaying the harvest. Whereas, neutral and acid detergent fiber were increased by delaying the harvest and decreased by the nitrogen application.

There is no validated scientific data on the efficacy of JPC on Peenisa Rogam. Therefore, this study was aimed to standardize the JPC in terms of phytochemicals, physico-chemicals and antioxidants as total polyphenolic content (TPC) before evaluating the efficacy. C. bonducella seeds, C. longa rhizome and N. sativa seeds were cleaned, dried, powdered separately and blend together in 2 : 1 : 1 w/w ratio to obtain JPC and used for the standardization. TPC was determined by Folin-Ciocalteu method.

There was a significant reduced proportion of saturated-to unsaturated fatty acids in the loin eye area of pigs fed whole soybean products, when compared to soybean meal control. Extruded whole soybeans resulted in a lower degree of unsaturation than the other heat treated whole soybeans. Whole soybean products were evaluated for their digestibility in weanling (21 days) piglets. Feces were collected daily during two 5 -day periods.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that fine {{structural}} modifications of Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell envelope lipids mediate host cell immune activation during infection. One such alteration in lipid structure is cis-cyclopropane modification of the mycolic acids on trehalose dimycolate (TDM) mediated by proximal cyclopropane synthase of α mycolates (pcaA), a proinflammatory lipid modification during early infection. Here we examine the pathogenetic role and immunomodulatory function of mycolic acid cyclopropane stereochemistry by characterizing an M. tuberculosis cyclopropane–mycolic acid synthase 2 (cmaA 2) null mutant (ΔcmaA 2) that lacks trans-cyclopropanation of mycolic acids. Although titers of WT and ΔcmaA 2 organisms were identical during mouse infection, ΔcmaA 2 bacteria were hypervirulent while inducing larger granulomas than WT M. tuberculosis. The hypervirulence of the ΔcmaA 2 strain depended on host TNF-α and IFN-γ. Loss of trans-cyclopropanation enhanced M. tuberculosis–induced macrophage inflammatory responses, a phenotype that was transferable with petroleum <b>ether</b> <b>extractable</b> lipids. Finally, purified TDM lacking trans-cyclopropane rings was 5 -fold more potent in stimulating macrophages. These results establish cmaA 2 -dependent trans-cyclopropanation of TDM as a suppressor of M. tuberculosis–induced inflammation and virulence.

40|$|We {{studied the}} effects of sera from {{patients}} with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) on interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) production to help elucidate the mechanism of immunodeficiency. Compared with sera from healthy controls, sera from AIDS patients suppressed phytohemagglutinin (PHA) -induced IL- 2 production by normal blood mononuclear cells. Sera from homosexual contacts of AIDS patients and from adults with acute cytomegalovirus infection generally lacked this suppressive activity. The effect of the AIDS sera could not be attributed to absence of a stimulatory or nutritive factor, to inactivation of IL- 2, to inhibition of the IL- 2 assay, nor to increased turnover of IL- 2. The suppressive effect of the sera was not mediated by radiosensitive or T 8 antigen-bearing suppressor cells or by increased prostaglandin production or decreased interleukin- 1 production. The sera acted directly on the groups of cells that produce IL- 2, T cells and large granular lymphocytes; suppression occurred at an early, probably pretranslational, stage. When cells were incubated with AIDS sera and then washed, the suppressive effect persisted. The sera did not cause direct or complement-mediated cytotoxic effects on normal mononuclear cells nor did they suppress PHA-induced interferon production, nor proliferation of T lymphoblasts or lymphocyte lines.

The blind loop syndrome was documented by the increased fat excretion and slower growth rate of self-filling blind loop rats 6 wk after surgery. With p-nitrophenylglycosides as substrate, the specific activity of α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, a potential blood group A destroying glycosidase, was 0. 90 ± 0. 40 mU/mg of protein. This level was 23 -fold higher than the specific activity of normal controls. In partially purified self-filling blind loop contents, the activity of α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase was 9 - to 70 -fold higher than activities of self-emptying and normal controls. Antibiotic treatment with chloromycetin and polymyxin decreased 24 -fold the glycosidase levels in self-filling blind loops. In experiments with natural substrate, the blood group A titer of a 20, 000 g supernate from normal jejunal homogenates decreased 128 -fold after 24 -h incubation with blind loop contents. Normal contents failed to diminish the blood group reactivity of the natural substrate. Furthermore, blind loop contents markedly decreased the blood group A titer of isolated brush borders. Incubation between blind loop bacteria and mucosal homogenates or isolated brush borders labeled with d-[U- 14 C]glucosamine revealed increased production of labeled <b>ether</b> <b>extractable</b> organic acids. Likewise, intraperitoneal injection of d-[U- 14 C]glucosamine into self-filling blind loop rats resulted in incorporation of the label into luminal short chain fatty acids.

The extractive solution was characterized by loss on drying, <b>extractable</b> <b>matter</b> and total phenolic and flavonoid compounds (chemical markers). The product was characterized by determination of loss on drying, size distribution, morphology, flow properties and thermal degradation and thermal behavior. The spray and spouted bed dryer performance were assessed through estimation of thermal efficiency, product accumulation and product recovery. The parameters studied were the inlet temperature of the spouting gas (80 and 150 degrees C) and the feed mass flow rate of concentrated extract relative to the evaporation capacity of the dryer, W-s/W-max (15 to 75 %). The atomizing air flow rate was maintained at 20 l/min with a pressure of 196. 1 kPa. The spouting gas flow rate used in the drying runs was 40 % higher than the gas flow under the condition of minimum spouting. The spray drying gas flow rate was fixed at 0. 0118 kg/s. Under the conditions studied, performance in the spray and spouted bed drying of rosemary extract was poor, causing high degradation of the marker compounds (mainly the phenolic compounds).

The interactive effects indicated that inoculation alone without nitrogen application produced 19. 16 % and 6. 87 % more dry matter yield and crude protein (%), respectively. The beneficiary effects of biofertilizers on growth and dry matter of oat were more pronounced at intermediate level of inorganic nitrogen which was gradually decreased at higher nitrogen levels. The CP, CPY and DCPY achieved with inoculation alone were statistically equivalent to plots fertilized with 0 and 40 kgNha− 1. It is clear that plots sown with inoculated seeds must be fertilized with 80 kgN to produce higher dry matter and economic returns. However, the highest protein contents in dry matter were recorded with highest fertilization level along with inoculation. By giving due attention to stimulatory effects of bacterial species in the present study, it is therefore, recommended to integrate the use of biofertilizers with supplemental dose of synthetic nitrogen source to sustain crop production...|$|R

This followed by methanolic extracts of Pterocladia capillacea (PCM 1 : AI =  0. 70  ±  0. 035 and Ulva fasciata (UFM 1 : AI =  0. 69  ±  0. 035). GC/MS analysis of ULM 1 and ULM 5 indicated the existence of different constituents revealing ecological impacts. The methanolic extract (UFM 1) contains six major components including palmitic acid, methylester, trichloromethyloxirane, linolenic acid, ethylester, 3, 7, 11, 15 -tetramethyl- 2 -hexadecen- 1 -ol, 11 -octadecenoic acid, methylester and 12, 15 -octadecadienoic acid, methylester. High percentages of palmitic acid, n-heptacosane, 2 -methylhexadecan- 1 -ol, methoxy acetic acid, 2 -tridecylester and myristic acid are found in the methanolic extract of P. capillacea (PCM 1). Most of the identified components have been reported to possess antimicrobial activity that could be responsible for the antifungal potential reported in the present study...|$|R
40|$|An {{immature}} sulfur-rich marl {{from the}} Gessosso-solfifera Formation of the Vena del Gesso Basin (Messinian, Italy) {{has been subjected}} to hydrous pyrolysis (160 to 330 °C) to simulate maturation under natural conditions. The kerogen of the unheated and heated samples was isolated and the hydrocarbons released by selective chemical degradation (Li/EtNH 2 and HI/LiAlH 4) were analysed to allow a study of the fate of sulfur- and oxygen-bound species with increasing temperature. The residues from the chemical treatments were also subjected to pyrolysis GC to follow structural changes in the kerogens. In general, with increasing hydrous pyrolysis temperature, the amounts of sulfide- and ether-bound components in the kerogen decreased significantly. At the temperature at which the generation of expelled oil began (260 °C), almost all of the bound components initially present in the unheated sample were released from the kerogen. Comparison with an earlier study of the <b>extractable</b> organic <b>matter</b> using a similar approach and the same samples provides molecular evidence that, with increasing maturation, solvent-soluble macromolecular material was initially released from the kerogen, notably as a result of thermal cleavage of weak carbon heteroatom bonds (sulfide, ester, ether) even at temperatures as low as 220 °C. This solvent-soluble macromolecular material then underwent thermal cleavage to generate hydrocarbons at higher temperatures. This early generation of bitumen may explain the presence of unusually high amounts of <b>extractable</b> organic <b>matter</b> of macromolecular nature in very immature S-rich sediments...|$|R
40|$|This paper selects two typical {{compounds}} containing {{organic sulfur}} as model compounds. Then, {{by analyzing the}} chromatograms of gaseous low-temp oxidation products and GC/MS of the <b>extractable</b> <b>matter</b> of the oxidation residue, we summarizing the mechanism of low-temp sulfur model compound oxidation. The results show that between 30 °C to 80 °C, the interaction between diphenyl sulfide and oxygen is mainly one of physical adsorption. After 80 °C, chemical adsorption and chemical reactions begin. The main reaction mechanism in the low-temp oxidation of the model compound diphenyl sulfide is diphenyl sulfide generates diphenyl sulfoxide, and then this sulfoxide is further oxidized to diphenyl sulphone. A small amount of free radicals is generated in the process. The model compound cysteine behaves differently from diphenyl sulfide. The main reaction low-temp oxidation mechanism involves the thiol being oxidized into a disulphide and finally evolving to sulfonic acid, along with SO 2 being released at 130 °C and also {{a small amount of}} free radicals. We also conducted an experiment on coal from Xingcheng using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results show that the major forms of organic sulfur in the original coal sample are thiophene and sulfone. Therefore, it can be inferred that there is none or little mercaptan and thiophenol in the original coal. After low-temp oxidation, the form of organic sulfur changes. The sulfide sulfur is oxidized to the sulfoxide, and then the sulfoxide is further oxidized to a sulfone, and these steps can be easily carried out under experimental conditions. What’s more, the results illustrate that oxidation promotes sulfur element enrichment on the surface of coal...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of Sr contents and isotopes of strontium Sr in the labile fraction of sediments from a channel fillings infill in the Middle Loire alluvial plain {{is used to}} highlight aspects {{of the evolution of}} the basin over the period from 10 000 yr. BP to the present. The acid <b>extractable</b> <b>matter</b> (AEM) in the sediment samples is variable in amount and in trace element contents. Carbonates and Fe–Mn oxyhydroxides are the principal carrying phases in the labile fraction. The historical record of 87 Sr / 86 Sr ratio variations in AEM shows two components. In the first, the AEM is consistently low (around 10 %) and the 87 Sr / 86 Sr ratios range from around 0. 7086 to 0. 710. This corresponds to the hydrous Fe-Mn oxides end-member. Fe–Mn oxyhydroxides originate from the Massif Central and their 87 Sr / 86 Sr ratios display a larger range than present day Fe–Mn oxides. Furthermore, the mixing proportions between Fe–Mn oxides generated on granitoids and on basalts fluctuated only weakly in the past. The second component has greater AEM (20 – 50 %) and the 87 Sr / 86 Sr ratio is almost constant at 0. 709 – 0. 7095. This corresponds to a carbonate endmember, clearly different from present day carbonates and may reflect the influence of both authigenic and detrital origins. The low 87 Sr / 86 Sr ratio suggests a dominantly authigenic source for the carbonate endmember; this may be linked to groundwater inputs, although a minor influence from a secondary detrital source cannot be discounted. This reflects a different functioning of the river between deposition in the channel and the present day...|$|R

40|$|Comunicación oral presentada en la Sesión SSS 29 Biogeochemical Interfaces in Soil. [...] Congreso celebrado del 19 - 24 de abril 2009, Viena, Austria. Ferrihydrite (Fh) - even {{if present}} at low {{concentrations}} - may control the available surface area and therefore, the behaviour of nutrients and pollutants in soils. Its precipitation often {{takes place in}} the presence of dissolved organic matter (OM). This involves processes such as adsorption, but also coprecipitation, ﬂocculation/coagulation and poisoning of crystal growth. In this study, we compare coprecipitation of organic matter and ferrihydrite with pure adsorption of OM on ferrihydrite. We therefore prepared an adsorption series and a coprecipitation series using (i) water <b>extractable</b> organic <b>matter</b> from a forest topsoil and (ii) sulﬁte extractable lignin from paper.
