5000|$|KALB began {{broadcasting}} on September 29, 1954 with NBC's {{airing of}} the 1954 World Series. It aired an analog signal on VHF channel 5. The station {{has been an}} affiliate with the NBC television network {{from the very first}} day although it also carried programs from CBS and DuMont until that network folded in 1955. In 1957, the station was bought by Shreveport businessman T. B. Lanford and his company Red River Valley Broadcasting. KALB also aired programming from ABC, such as Happy Days, on a secondary basis from 1954 until the early 1980s, shortly before rival station (and future ABC affiliate) KLAX signed on.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58-FhbjXk18 KALB began broadcasting in stereo in 1988. Park Communications purchased KALB in 1993 and merged with Media General in 1997.

50|$|However, after WBMA-LP {{replaced}} WBRC as {{formed as}} the market's ABC affiliate in September 1996, WVTM had {{to fend off}} a spirited challenge from the upstart station (to which it lost two of its well-known anchors, Pam Huff and Tracy Haynes, who were later hired to anchor that station's morning newscasts). Since {{the start of the}} new millennium, it has also had to contend with a resurgent WIAT, whose news ratings prior to the February 1998 relaunch of its news department had generally languished at a very distant fourth place for much of its history up to that point. Indeed, since 2006, WIAT has consistently beaten WVTM in the late news ratings. In contrast to WIAT's renewed performance under Media <b>General</b> <b>ownership,</b> ratings averages for WVTM's newscasts slipped to fourth place among the market's five major television news operations (ahead of WVUA-CD (channel 7) and behind WBMA-LD and WIAT) during the company's ownership of channel 13, where it remains to this day.|$|E
50|$|The {{extensive}} {{changes that}} helped WIAT become a ratings {{force in the}} market in the latter years under Media <b>General</b> <b>ownership</b> continued as a New Vision-owned station. Under New Vision, channel 42 saw some of its largest ratings increases in the station's history. It {{is now one of the}} strongest CBS affiliates in the nation, after spending the better part of its history as one of the weakest. WIAT has particularly benefited from the network's broadcasts of college football games from the Southeastern Conference, which garner higher ratings on channel 42 than on any other television station in the nation. SEC game telecasts, particularly those involving the Alabama Crimson Tide and Auburn Tigers, are among the highest-rated programs in Birmingham during the NCAA Division I football season, typically delivering higher ratings in the market than network telecasts of the Super Bowl; this includes the Iron Bowl rivalry game between Alabama and Auburn, which - through CBS - has aired on WIAT for all but three years since 2000.|$|E
50|$|In 1955, General Tire {{purchased}} RKO Radio Pictures, {{giving the}} company's TV stations access to RKO's film library, and in 1959, General Tire's broadcasting and film divisions were renamed as RKO General. During {{the early years}} of RKO <b>General</b> <b>ownership,</b> WOR-TV moved back to Times Square, and closer to its radio station sisters. Channel 9's studios were co-located with WOR radio at 1440 Broadway (near West 40th Street) for several years. During the 1950s and early 1960s, all three of New York's independents struggled to find competitive and acceptable programming. The field would increase by one in 1956 when former DuMont flagship station WABD (channel 5, later WNEW-TV and now WNYW) became an independent. During this era, WOR-TV's programming was comparable to its rivals, with a blend of movies, children's programs, cancelled TV series which had previously run on one of the networks and public affairs shows. In 1962, the field of independent stations was narrowed to three, as WOR-TV and its competition benefited from the sale of WNTA-TV to the non-profit Educational Broadcasting Corporation, who would convert channel 13 into non-commercial educational station WNDT (which is now PBS member station WNET).|$|E

50|$|On June 21, 1948, the Yankee Network {{launched}} New England's third television station: Boston's WNAC-TV {{went on the}} air {{just days}} after WBZ-TV, also in Boston, and WNHC-TV, licensed to New Haven, Connecticut. The TV station's transmitter site also served a new FM outlet, the first and only station to be established under <b>General</b> Tire <b>ownership.</b> While the Yankee Network had been operating experimental FM stations since 1939, WNAC-FM was the first that would survive past the early 1950s.|$|R

5000|$|In 1969 the Boston Herald-Traveler Corp., WHDH-TV's parent company, {{lost its}} license to operate channel 5. Boston Broadcasters, Inc., {{the owners of}} the station that {{replaced}} it, WCVB-TV, planned to air more local programming than any other station in the country, heavily preempting CBS programming in the process. CBS was not pleased at the prospect of massive preemptions on what would have been its second-largest affiliate and its largest affiliate on the East Coast. The CBS affiliation immediately moved back to channel 7, leaving channel 5 to affiliate with ABC. The second network switch in Boston-essentially, a reversal of what took place in 1961-occurred on March 19, 1972, WCVB-TV's first day of operations; Boston's ABC affiliation remains on channel 5 to this day. However, late in 1973, WNAC-TV adopted a version of the circle 7 logo, similar to that used by ABC's owned-and-operated stations; in 1977, ABC complained that the station was infringing on its trademark, and changed its logo to a Times-Serif-Italic [...] "7". In late 1981, a stylish, strip-layered [...] "7" [...] was introduced, which ended up being the last logo redesign under RKO <b>General</b> <b>ownership.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Print {{media are}} {{included}} in the scope of the Law on the Press no. 243 of 1994, which is an obsolete law that has widely fallen into disuse. Article 12 and 13 contain provisions concerning media ownership transparency. Specifically, the law requires print media to make public information about the source and value of donations (including non-monetary ones) collected in the country and abroad to be disclosed twice a year and some mandatory data to be published in every issue (title of publication, the founder, the name of the editor, price per copy, address of the editorial office, circulation, number of registration, etc). The law prohibits the circulation of publications which do not comply with these rules, but this provision is ineffective since there are no sanctions to enforce it. Under the law, the public has access to only a minimum part of information on management and founders of the publications, while the Minister of Justice requires more detailed information in order to issue the registration certificates to the media applying for them. In sum, public access to <b>general</b> <b>ownership</b> information on print media is largely limited. [...] Moreover, the law does not oblige print media to disclose information about interests held in other media, nor about the persons other than those directly involved in the editorial structure that are in the position to exercise a significant influence over the editorial policy of the media outlet.|$|E
50|$|On March 21, 2014, LIN Media {{entered into}} an {{agreement}} to merge with Media General in a $1.6 billion deal. Because Media General already owned CBS affiliate WKRG-TV (channel 5), the companies planned to either sell WALA or WKRG to comply with FCC ownership rules as well as planned changes to those rules regarding same-market television stations which would prohibit sharing agreements. In addition, WFNA would also either be retained by Media General {{to form a new}} duopoly with WKRG or remain part of the existing duopoly with WALA should the two stations be kept or sold off. On August 20, 2014, it was announced that WALA will be sold to the Meredith Corporation, however WFNA {{was not included in the}} sale; as a result, WFNA will form a new duopoly with WKRG under Media <b>General</b> <b>ownership,</b> marking the first time since the FCC allowed legal television duopolies in August 1999 that a station has been involved in a sale transaction in which it was fully separated from its original duopoly partner to form another duopoly (a similar situation occurred in Phoenix, Arizona with KTVK and KASW upon their sales to Meredith in December 2013, which already owned KPHO-TV in that market, although KASW was retained by Meredith through a shared services agreement). The merger was completed on December 19. Oddly, Meredith retained the domain for WFNA's website, and until the Nexstar merger closed the station had no site, even for minimum FCC and Equal Opportunity Employer disclosures. This has since been rectified.|$|E

50|$|A {{few months}} after Media <b>General</b> <b>ownership</b> of the station {{following}} its merger with Park Communications, newly appointed general manager Eric Land decided to completely reboot the news department. On December 12, 1997, Land announced to station employees {{that the bulk of}} channel 42's news staff, totaling 21 employees (eight anchors and thirteen other on-air and production staff members, including all of the station's on-air reporters and several producers and editors), would be laid off. The late-evening newscast on December 31 would become the last regular newscast on channel 42 in the interim, as on January 1, 1998, Land temporarily suspended the news department, cancelling the station's morning and evening newscasts; all of the remaining members of channel 42's news staff were fired, with the exception of weekend sports anchor Sam Smith. Over the next month, channel 42 rebuilt its news department from scratch with input from focus groups and market research. During that time, the station began filling the 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. time slots respectively with religious and syndicated programming; meanwhile, it also showed a much-talked-about slide of a computer-animated digital countdown clock during the 5:00 and 10:00 p.m. half-hours, where newscasts would air once the department was relaunched. During this time, the station sent coverage of the January 29 bombing of the New Woman All Women Clinic in Birmingham's Southside neighborhood by Eric Rudolph to CBS Newspath, CNN and to stations in neighboring markets, even though it did not have a formal news department at the time.|$|E

30|$|To sum up, {{one could}} say that, in <b>general,</b> foreign <b>ownership</b> tends to {{increase}} the wage rate, largely because of improved labour productivity, and {{that at least some}} studies have found that these wage increases spill over into other firms in the same sector. Nonetheless, it needs to be borne in mind that most of the previous studies have looked at labour markets considerably less unionised than Sweden’s. It also needs to be borne in mind that the type of firm acquired by foreign investors may be different from an average firm, in the country and even in the same sector.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Given {{adolescents}} ' heavy {{social media}} use, {{this study examined}} a number of predictors of adolescent social media use, as well as predictors of online communication practices. Using data collected from a national sample of 467 adolescents {{between the ages of}} 13 and 17, results indicate that demographics, technology access, and technology ownership are related to social media use and communication practices. Specifically, females log onto and use more constructive communication practices on Facebook compared to males. Additionally, adolescents who own smartphones engage in more constructive online communication practices than those who share regular cell phones or those who {{do not have access to}} a cell phone.
