5|$|Advancements in {{microscopic}} stamping {{have led}} to a push for the inclusion of firing pin microstamping. The microstamp is etched onto the firing pin and is transferred to the cartridge during the firing process. Each firing pin would have a unique serial number allowing investigators to trace casings found at a crime scene to a known firearm. The practice is not in use , although California has enacted legislation that requires microstamping on all newly sold firearms. The law, and microstamping in <b>general,</b> <b>has</b> received significant opposition from gun manufacturers due to increased costs associated with introducing the microstamps into the manufacturing lines.|$|E
5|$|Although initial {{box office}} {{reception}} was positive {{both in the}} United Kingdom and overseas, Inseminoid has since failed to impress a majority of critics, who have faulted Warren's film for perceived poor acting, special effects and set design. Despite praise for actress Judy Geeson's depiction of the lead character, Sandy, approval of the film in <b>general</b> <b>has</b> been tarnished due to its concept of an extraterrestrial insemination, which has been viewed negatively {{in comparison to the}} premise of Alien (1979). Both Warren and Alien distributors 20th Century Fox have rejected claims that the script of Inseminoid was influenced by that of the earlier film.|$|E

5|$|Cook County {{homeowners are}} {{eligible}} for a property-tax break on their primary residence, but a manager in Assessor's office was granted the homeowner's exemption on two homes. In 2012 Cook County Inspector General Blanchard subpoenaed the Assessor's office seeking documents related to the exemptions. Berrios ignored the subpoena, claiming that the County Inspector <b>General</b> <b>has</b> no authority over him. Blanchard filed suit against Berrios. Berrios is represented in the suit by Cook County State's Attorney Alvarez. On January, 15, 2014, a Cook County circuit court judge ruled that the County Inspector General {{had the authority to}} investigate the Assessor and all other independently elected County offices. On August 21, 2014, the judge ruled the Assessor must comply with the Inspector General's subpoena. On December 1, 2016, the Illinois Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the Cook County Inspector <b>General</b> <b>has</b> the power to investigate the Cook County Assessor, affirming two lower court decisions.|$|E

5|$|NASCAR, {{and stock}} car racing in <b>general,</b> <b>has</b> {{its roots in}} bootlegging during Prohibition.

He ended up spending a year in an Ohio prison, but soon returned to the sport before retiring as a driver in 1966.|$|E

5|$|The Chief Herald of Canada, {{whose job}} is to oversee and direct all {{operations}} of the CHA, bears the main responsibility of granting arms, though the governor <b>general</b> <b>has</b> the authority to grant arms directly. The position of chief herald was inaugurated by Robert Watt at the inception of the CHA in 1988 and held by him until his retirement in 2007. Since June 26, 2007, the office of chief herald has been held by Claire Boudreau, formerly Saint-Laurent Herald.|$|E

Since 1962, a banner of the arms, defaced with a variant of the Queen's cypher, has formed the Royal Standard of Canada, for use by the Canadian sovereign. The personal flag of the Governor <b>General</b> <b>has</b> featured the crest of the arms of Canada on a blue background since 1981.|$|E

5|$|Puerto Rico's herpetofauna {{consists}} of 25 amphibian species and 61 reptile species. The majority of West Indian terrestrial reptile clade {{is believed to}} have arrived by flotsam dispersion from South America. Little evidence exists to support the alternative hypothesis of proto-Antillean vicariance. Other terrestrial herpetofauna are believed to have arrived to the West Indies (and Puerto Rico) by the same method and subsequently undergone vicarization by banks or islands. As a result, Puerto Rico, and the Caribbean in <b>general,</b> <b>has</b> one of the highest percentages of endemism among amphibians and reptiles in the world. Amphibian species in Puerto Rico belong to four families: Bufonidae (2 species), Hylidae (3), Leptodactylidae (18) and Ranidae (2). Reptiles include turtles (freshwater and marine), lizards, worm lizards, snakes and a caiman.|$|E

5|$|The {{preservation}} of Gibraltar's fortifications, {{and of its}} architectural heritage in <b>general,</b> <b>has</b> been a problematic issue. The peninsula is extremely short of land; in the early 1980s, nearly half the available land was in military usage, comprising the naval dockyard, {{the whole of the}} southern part of Gibraltar, {{the upper part of the}} Rock and a significant amount of property within the city walls, in addition to the runway and military facilities on the isthmus. Until recently, Gibraltar had no public sea front of its own due to military land usage. As the military presence has been run down, MOD property has been handed over to the Government of Gibraltar but the latter has lacked the resources to look after all of the buildings and land that have been transferred. This has led to the abandonment and severe physical deterioration of significant parts of Gibraltar's military heritage.|$|E
5|$|The {{surface of}} Callisto {{is the oldest}} and most heavily cratered in the Solar System. Its surface is {{completely}} covered with impact craters. It does not show any signatures of subsurface processes such as plate tectonics or volcanism, with no signs that geological activity in <b>general</b> <b>has</b> ever occurred, and is thought to have evolved predominantly under the influence of impacts. Prominent surface features include multi-ring structures, variously shaped impact craters, and chains of craters (catenae) and associated scarps, ridges and deposits. At a small scale, the surface is varied and made up of small, sparkly frost deposits at the tips of high spots, surrounded by a low-lying, smooth blanket of dark material. This is thought to result from the sublimation-driven degradation of small landforms, which is supported by the general deficit of small impact craters and the presence of numerous small knobs, considered to be their remnants. The absolute ages of the landforms are not known.|$|E
5|$|While McClellan's {{reputation}} {{has suffered}} over time, especially {{over the last}} 75 years, {{there is a small}} but intense cadre of American Civil War historians who believe that the <b>general</b> <b>has</b> been poorly served on at least four levels. First, McClellan proponents say that because the general was a conservative Democrat with great personal charisma, radical Republicans fearing his political potential deliberately undermined his field operations. Second, that as the radical Republicans were the true winners coming out of the American Civil War, they were able to write its history, placing their principal political rival of the time, McClellan, in the worst possible light. Third, that historians eager to jump on the bandwagon of Lincoln as America's greatest political icon worked to outdo one another in shifting blame for early military failures from Lincoln and Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton to McClellan. And fourth, that Lincoln and Stanton deliberately undermined McClellan because of his conciliatory stance towards the South, which might have resulted in a less destructive end to the war had Richmond fallen {{as a result of the}} Peninsula Campaign. Proponents of this school claim that McClellan is criticized more for his admittedly abrasive personality than for his actual field performance.|$|E
