5|$|By March, front-runner John McCain {{had secured}} enough pledged delegates to {{guarantee}} that he would win the nomination, and Romney and Huckabee had both formally withdrawn from the race. Paul, who had won no state primaries, {{knew that it was}} now mathematically impossible for him to win the nomination, as he had captured only 20– 40 pledged delegates compared to more than 1,191 <b>for</b> <b>McCain,</b> yet he refused to concede the race and said that it was unlikely that he would ultimately endorse McCain. Over the next few weeks, Paul's supporters clashed with establishment Republicans at several county and state party conventions over state party rules, the party platforms, and selection of delegates for the national convention. In one of the more dramatic moments, Nevada's state party leaders, outmaneuvered by Paul supporters at the state nominating convention, resorted to the highly unusual measure of prematurely and abruptly shutting down the convention before selecting national delegates, with a plan to reconvene at a later date.|$|E
25|$|Many {{opinion leaders}} {{predicted}} that Barr could siphon off conservative votes {{that would have}} otherwise gone to McCain. John Linder, who defeated Barr for the Republican nomination in a 2002 congressional race, said that Barr could cause serious problems <b>for</b> <b>McCain</b> in some states. Barr repeatedly rejected this assertion as scapegoating, responding that small-government Republicans would not vote <b>for</b> <b>McCain</b> anyway, nor would civil liberties advocates vote for Obama.|$|E

25|$|On Election Day, Obama {{won by a}} 9.54-point margin. The {{reliably}} Republican {{western part}} of the state turned out <b>for</b> <b>McCain</b> as expected. When a Republican wins Iowa, everything west of the state capital, Des Moines, is coated red. Indeed, John Kerry didn't win a single county in western Iowa in 2004, a major factor in Bush's narrow victory here. However, Obama significantly improved on Kerry's performance four years earlier. Pottawattamie County, home to Council Bluffs, went from an 18-point win for Bush to only a two-point win <b>for</b> <b>McCain.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Republican base in Virginia {{consists}} of the state's traditional Republican heartland in the Blue Ridge Mountains, social conservatives in the Shenandoah Valley and suburbanites in the east. McCain closely matched George W. Bush's numbers among the first group and only did slightly worse than Bush amongst the second group.
