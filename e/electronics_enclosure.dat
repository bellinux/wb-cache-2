In addition, component pressure drop characteristics were found experimentally for grilles and fin banks, and these empirical relationships were applied to the model as well. To determine the validity of the simplifications employed in the model, experimental outlet temperature and velocity measurements were taken to compare to those provided by the CFD-HT simulations. M.

40|$|Thermal {{management}} of laptops is an increasingly challenging task {{because of the}} high-heat flux associated with the microprocessors and the limited space available for the thermal control system inside the cabinet. In this paper, results are discussed from an investigation of two different designs of miniature loop heat pipes (mLHPs) for thermal control of compact electronic devices including notebooks. Two prototypes of mLHP, one with a disk-shaped evaporator, 30 mm diameter and 10 mm thick, {{and the other with}} a rectangular-shaped evaporator, 47 Ã¿Â¿ 37 mm 2 plan area and 5 mm thick, were designed to handle heat fluxes up to 50 W/cm 2. In the disk-shaped evaporator, the compensation chamber was incorporated into the overall thickness of the evaporator, whereas for the rectangular-shaped evaporator a new design approach was used in which the compensation chamber was positioned {{on the sides of the}} wick structure such that it was coplanar with the evaporator section. The new design approach helped to decrease the thickness of the rectangular evaporator by 50 % and therefore improved the ability to integrate miniature loop heat pipe technology into compact <b>electronics</b> <b>enclosures.</b> All of the thermal tests on mLHP prototypes were conducted in horizontal configurations.

40|$|Centrifugal {{fans are}} often {{integrated}} into thermal management solutions {{for a range}} of applications. Consequently, centrifugal fan designs can be subjected to varying environmental conditions, many of which can alter fan performance characteristics and ultimately influence the heat transfer performance of the cooling solution. Global cross flows are a commonly encountered practical operating condition, particularly in the cooling of <b>electronics.</b> Air-cooled electronic <b>enclosures</b> often incorporate miniature centrifugal fans to maintain reliable component operating temperatures at a local level, while larger system level fans are used to simultaneously control the ambient temperature within the enclosure. This type of operating condition has been investigated by introducing a uniform crossing air flow above a centrifugal fan inlet. Two scaled miniature centrifugal fan designs were selected to fundamentally assess the influence on local velocity field and heat transfer performance. This was achieved experimentally using Particle Image Velocimetry, and a combined infrared and heated-thin-foil technique developed for the accurate measurement of local heat transfer coefficients. the introduction of a crossing air flow above the fan inlet indirectly reduced both the local and global thermal performance of the centrifugal fan, and the resultant distorted inflow shifted the surface heat transfer distribution at the fan outlet from an axisymmetric to asymmetric profile. However, strategic positioning of components relative to a centrifugal fan can maintain the average component heat transfer coefficient at a similar level to a case without any cross flow. Results also indicate issues associated with the implementation of miniature centrifugal fan designs into crossing air flow environments, with reductions in thermal performance of over 30 % observed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{research}} is to search for the existence of biomass under extreme temperature and pressure conditions to determine the upper bounds of environments on which life can exist. Vents are, simply put, underwater volcano openings located {{at the bottom of the}} sea. The conditions at these locations are considerably extreme with pressures of up to 10, 000 psi, and enormous temperature gradients. The temperature of the water near these vents is around 400 C, while that of the surrounding water is about 3 C. The extremity of these conditions makes it hard to estimate the existence of life in those environments. I n order to find whether such existence happens, we need to search for biomass inside these vents. The vent sampler is a device that has the purpose of safely and accurately collecting this biomass for examination. This sampler is constituted of a Series of filters of the order of 100 - 0. 2 microns in size.

40|$|Electronics warming has broad {{applications}} in the aerospace industry, where electronics assemblies are subject to lower than recommended temperature environments. Prior to operation {{it is necessary to}} raise the temperature of the electronics to the minimum safe operating level, recommended by the manufacturer. This is managed by adding an electrical heater inside the <b>electronics</b> assembly <b>enclosure.</b> A very important characteristic of the heater is how quickly the desired temperature needs to be reached. Of course, this characteristic determines the size of the heater needed for the warm up process. Since relatively low failure mode temperatures are often required by the aerospace industry, there is an additional level of complexity involved in designing the optimum size of a heater. In a failure mode condition, the analysis requires a heater to be sized to produce a small amount of heat even under hot environmental conditions. The two requirements of fast warm up time and low failure mode temperatures seem contradictory. The art of the Thermal Management in this type of design is {{to come up with a}} specific optimum heater size that can satisfy a rapid warm up requirement and yet not exceed the maximum allowable temperature during a failure mode scenario. Often a thermal engineer needs to work with an electrical engineer to manipulate the control algorithm for the heater in order to satisfy these two requirements. This study will investigate how to approach such a problem and how one can size such heater. Also, optimization techniques are considered in order to choose the proper design among all available solutions. There are two different ways to achieve a desired warm up time of a cold soaked electronics assembly. The first approach may require some manipulation of the location of the heater inside the box or the addition of insulating materials. This approach captures the heat generated by the heater inside the enclosure in order to achieve quicker warm up period. However, the presence of an insulator increases the risk of dangerously high temperatures during a failure mode scenario. To alleviate the insulator effect, the external enclosure heat dissipation mechanism must be altered. This kind of modification is costly and requires additional design steps. This is where the benefit of the second approach comes in. Namely, the desired result of a fast warm up time and lower failure mode temperatures can be achieved by manipulating the heater controller and controlling the amount of power to the heater. A Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) Controller can be used to control not only the amount of heat generated by a heater, but also the percentage of heater "on” time within one pulse width and therefore the warm up time. Having the ability to control the frequency of releasing heat into the cold enclosure allows us to indicate two new parameters : the amount of heat load and the heat load frequency of inserting heat. A thermal management scheme can be developed to optimize the most efficient pair of values that will meet warm up time and failure mode temperature criteria. An analytical model is developed to study the thermal management of such a problem. The analytical model is used to perform an optimization study and to recommend a heater controller design for a given required specification...|$|R
40|$|This system {{provides}} a portable means to detect gas flow through a thin-walled tube without {{breaking into the}} tubing system. The flow detection system was specifically designed to detect flow through two parallel branches of a manifold with only one inlet and outlet, and is a means for verifying a space shuttle program requirement that saves time and {{reduces the risk of}} flight hardware damage compared to the current means of requirement verification. The prototype Purge Vent and Drain Window Cavity Conditioning System (PVD WCCS) Flow Detection System consists of a heater and a temperature-sensing thermistor attached to a piece of Velcro to be attached to each branch of a WCCS manifold {{for the duration of the}} requirement verification test. The heaters and thermistors are connected to a shielded cable and then to an <b>electronics</b> <b>enclosure,</b> which contains the power supplies, relays, and circuit board to provide power, signal conditioning, and control. The <b>electronics</b> <b>enclosure</b> is then connected to a commercial data acquisition box to provide analog to digital conversion as well as digital control. This data acquisition box is then connected to a commercial laptop running a custom application created using National Instruments LabVIEW. The operation of the PVD WCCS Flow Detection System consists of first attaching a heater/thermistor assembly to each of the two branches of one manifold while there is no flow through the manifold. Next, the software application running on the laptop is used to turn on the heaters and to monitor the manifold branch temperatures. When the system has reached thermal equilibrium, the software application s graphical user interface (GUI) will indicate that the branch temperatures are stable. The operator can then physically open the flow control valve to initiate the test flow of gaseous nitrogen (GN 2) through the manifold. Next, the software user interface will be monitored for stable temperature indications when the system is again at thermal equilibrium with the test flow of GN 2. The temperature drop of each branch from its "no flow" stable temperature peak to its stable "with flow" temperature will allow the operator to determine whether a minimum level of flow exists. An alternative operation has the operator turning on the software only long enough to record the ambient temperature of the tubing before turning on the heaters and initiating GN 2 flow. The stable temperature of the heated tubing with GN 2 flow is then compared with the ambient tubing temperature to determine if flow is present in each branch. To help quantify the level of flow in the manifolds, each branch will be bench calibrated to establish its thermal properties using the flow detection system and different flow rates. These calibration values can then be incorporated into the software application to provide more detailed flow rate information...|$|E

40|$|This is {{a thesis}} project {{conducted}} {{during the spring of}} 2014 for Bachelor of Science in Industrial Design Engineering. The work includes 15 credits. The assignment was to try to develop a new enclosure for a serial conversion device sold by Hugo Tillquist AB. A conversion device is a product that monitors the status of the electricity distribution grid. The project aims to investigate the re-quirements for an <b>electronics</b> <b>enclosure</b> and the needs that are the basis for the claims. The goal of development is to provide a manufacturing base form of a solidmodel of an electronic housing for transducers. This is to minimize complexity of the product and to make production cost-effective. This has been achieved through the collection of background information, context investigation. This study formed the basis for a design specification that dictates what the product will do and how. With the aid of the design specification ideas have been generated, by using creative methods that support idea generation such as morphological matrix and random words. Later, ideas and partial solutions are combined to various concepts supported by style board. Sketches have been widely used in idea generation and forwardimportantly in concept generation. To select a final concept was used as a balanced elimination matrix to compare how well the concepts corresponded to the requirements of the design specification. A rough cost estimate for the cost to put the new housing production was developed. This is to ensure that the new prolowered product costs related to housing. Results of this work were an enclosure consisting of modules that are pieced together after the current circuit board to be enclosed. The modules are held together to each other with the help of snap fasteners. The enclosure minimizes installation time and keeps a high modularization level, which means that if it is desired, a new variant is easy to develop. The enclosure is proposed to be produced by means of injection molding to manufacture the high precision snap fasteners require. So that the enclosure will be robust, flame retardant, heat dissipative and electrically isolated the manufacturer should select a plastic material, preferably glass fiber reinforced polyamide.

40|$|Responding to {{a growing}} need to specify (nowcast) and predict (forecast) {{hazardous}} space weather events and their deleterious effects on space systems, the authors have developed a prototype suite of instruments that {{would serve as a}} key component of a miniature space weather station. Space environment data have been gathered over several solar cycles, and though these data assist space operators in 2 ̆ 2 predicting 2 ̆ 2 hazards to space systems based upon derived climatology, no true forecasting ability yet exists. (As an analogy, consider for example the difference between tropospheric weather reports based on data-driven forecast models versus a 2 ̆ 2 prediction 2 ̆ 2 based upon the average temperature for a given city on a given date over the last hundred years.) True space weather forecasting models require assimilation of space-based in situ data into physics-based models. Data collection of fundamental characteristics, such as plasma density and temperature, neutral wind and bulk ion velocity, and electric and magnetic field strengths is required at multiple grid points, similar to tropospheric weather stations that measure temperature, wind speed, humidity, etc. Recent breakthroughs in fabrication techniques have enabled the development of a suite of instruments that is comprised of 16 individual analyzers, each of which is capable of providing a unique measurement of a partially ionized space environment. The suite is designed to measure ion spectra differential in energy and angle, bulk ion velocities, bulk neutral velocities, and ion and neutral mass spectra. Preliminary functional testing has indicated the ability to resolve He, O, O 2, and Ar; separation of O 2 and N 2 has proved elusive to date.
