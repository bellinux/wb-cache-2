The idea is to discard all the ungrammatical events which are impossible in a well written text and con-sequently to expect an improvement of the language model. We expect also, in speech recognition, to reduce the com-plexity of the search algorithm by making less comparisons. To achieve that, we extract the impossible bigrams by us-ing automatic rules. These rules are based on grammatical classes. The biclass associations which are ungrammatical are detected and all the corresponding bigrams are analyzed and set as possible or impossible events. As, in natural lan-guage, grammatical rules can have exceptions, we decided to manage for each of the retrieved rules an <b>exception</b> <b>list.</b> 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} design of an Identity-based CAPability {{protection}} system ICAP, which is aimed at a distributed system in a network environment. The semantics of traditional capabilities are modified to incorporate subject identities.

It also supports administrative activities such as traceability. We have developed an <b>exception</b> <b>list</b> approach to achieve rapid revocation {{and the idea of}} capability propagation trees for complete revocation. A separate access control list is to represent and interpret security policy. Compared with existing capability system designs, ICAP requires much less storage and has the potential of lower cost and better real-time performance.

The {{structure of the}} economy is characterised by a specific factor trade model and consumers' preferences are quasilinears. Owners of specific factors all are organised in lobby groups and the ownership are very concentrated. The available options to the government are mantain the trade policy status quo or implement an opening trade reform. Lobbys group influence this discretional government with income contribution taking into account its own objective function. The equilibrium of the game is studied in two differents situations: without exceptions in the trade liberalisation; with the presence of sector <b>exception</b> <b>list.</b> It is shown that a commercial opening that is not a political equilibrium (it is not incentives compatible) when the government wants to make it in general, however can be so if the government is able to isolate certain sectors from the international competition, through long periods of adjustment (given by gradual policies or the existence of exceptions list). ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this master’s thesis is to analyse the {{efficiency}} of the proposed moderations to the OECD Model Tax Convention’s definition of permanent establishment (article 5 of the OECD Model) demonstrated in the BEPS Action Plan 7. The Action Plan 7 “Preventing the artificial avoidance of permanent establishment status” is focused on two main problems that has been acknowledged to cause artificial tax avoidance in the regard of the permanent establishments. In this theses the analysis is focused on the other of these main concerns, the moderations proposed to the specific <b>exceptions</b> <b>list</b> and it’s commentary. The other significant part of the Action Plan 7 that handles the PE avoidance through commissionaire arrangements and similar strategies, is only mentioned as a reference in this theses. The main idea behind the newly proposed alterations to the Model Tax Convention’s article 5 (4) considering the specific <b>exceptions</b> <b>list</b> is to prevent abuse of the treaty benefit (the non-establishment of the PE) in situations described in the specific <b>exceptions</b> <b>list.</b> The list contains examples on the situations where permanent establishment would not be formed, but the current list is outdated and does not keep up with the current business environment, as evolving technology is continuously forming new and alternative ways to conduct business. This has lead to the situation, where the overall practical interpretation of the specific <b>exceptions</b> <b>list</b> does not reflect to the meaning and original background of the provision and abusing the provision is relatively easy and also currently allowed by the system as particular rules do not prohibit it. To keep up with the business environmental changes of the day, the BEPS Action Plan proposes that the character requirement of “preparatory or auxiliary nature” would be expanded to cover the specific <b>exceptions</b> <b>list</b> as a whole. In addition to the character requirement, also a new “anti-fragmentation rule” against the artificial decentralizing of business operations within closely related enterprises was presented. The anti-fragmentation rule complements the requirement of preparatory or auxiliary nature and improves the effectiveness of the provisions. Put together these measures are deemed to prevent further abuses of the specific <b>exceptions</b> <b>list.</b> In this theses the proposed alterations to the article are demonstrated and analysed {{in the light of the}} definition of “artificial avoidance”. Also further reasoning and speculation of the term “artificial” is made both from domestic and international point of view. Another important part of this theses is the evaluation of the Finnish point of view to the implementation of the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS. The convention is intended to help with the swift and coherent implementation of the BEPS proposals into the national jurisdictions and their tax treaties. The efficient implementation of the moderations proposed in the BEPS Action Plan 7 considering the anti-abuse of the specific <b>exceptions</b> <b>list</b> of article 5 (4) of the OECD Model Tax Convention is a key factor in determining the success and impressiveness of the BEPS whole report. The Finnish national stand on implementation of the convention taken in the Ministry of Finance memorandum is critically evaluated, and also statements form relevant parties have been analyzed and taken into consideration. The principal outcome of this theses is a conclusion that in theory, the proposed measures against the abuse of the specific <b>exceptions</b> <b>list</b> are efficient and they would be suitable for their purpose and ambitions. However the concrete and actual efficiency cannot be defined theoretically only, and the eventual outcome of the whole BEPS project is now fully depending on the political will of the nations to make the changes come into reality also in action, not just in theory...|$|R

Consequently, RGBColor is no more. In most cases, you can {{substitute}} RGBColor with sRGBColor during your upgrade. RGB channels are now [0 [...] 1] instead of [1 [...] 255]. Can use BaseRGBColor. get_upscaled_value_tuple() to get the upscaled values. BaseRGBColor. set_from_rgb_hex() was replaced with a BaseRGBColor. new_from_rgb_hex(), which returns a properly formed sRGBColor object. BaseRGBColor no longer accepts observer or illuminant kwargs. HSL no longer accepts observer, illuminant or rgb_type kwargs. HSV no longer accepts observer, illuminant or rgb_type kwargs. CMY no longer accepts observer, illuminant or rgb_type kwargs. CMYK no longer accepts observer, illuminant or rgb_type kwargs. Removed 'debug' kwargs in favor of Python's logging. Completely re-worked <b>exception</b> <b>list.</b> Eliminated some redundant exceptions, re-named basically everything else. Features Python 3. 3 support added. Added tox. ini with supported environments. Removed the old custom test runner in favor of nose. Replacing simplified RGB->XYZ conversions with Bruce Lindbloom's. A round of PEP 8 work.
