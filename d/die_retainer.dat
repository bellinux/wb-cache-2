25|$|The Incas practiced human sacrifice, {{especially}} at great festivals or royal funerals where <b>retainers</b> <b>died</b> {{to accompany the}} dead into the next life. The Moche of Eastern Peru sacrificed teenagers en masse, as archaeologist Steve Bourget found when he uncovered the bones of 42 male adolescents in 1995.|$|R
50|$|Gudrun and Atli hold {{a funeral}} feast. Gudrun kills Atli's two sons, and gives their blood and hearts to Atli {{to eat and}} drink. Atli says she deserves to be killed. Hogni's son Niflung wants to avenge his father, so he and Gudrun stab Atli while he is asleep. After he dies, Gudrun sets the hall on fire and all Atli's <b>retainers</b> <b>die</b> while {{fighting}} each other in panic.|$|R
25|$|King Djer, Aha's son and successor, had 318 {{retainer}} sacrifices {{buried in}} his tomb, and 269 retainer sacrifices buried in enclosures surrounding his tomb. Dr. O'Connor {{believes that the}} more than 200 graves found in King Djer's funerary complex contain retainer sacrifices, as well. According to Ancient Egypt: A Social History, King Djer was buried with over 580 retainers. It {{is highly unlikely that}} all these <b>retainers</b> <b>died</b> of natural causes at the same time, suggesting that these retainers were sacrificed upon the death of King Djer. According to the National Geographic's article, however, 569 retainers were sacrificed for King Djer.|$|R
50|$|Kosuge Tadamoto (<b>died</b> 1582) a <b>retainer</b> of the Japanese clan of Takeda {{during the}} Sengoku period (16th century) of Japan. Tadamoto had {{at one time}} been a daimyo within the {{province}} of Shinano. Tadamoto had served under the famed Yamagata Masakage, {{in which it is}} thought that Tadamoto had been a relative of some sort towards Masakage. Tadamoto would later fight in various campaigns such as Nagashino in 1575. Tadamoto would afterwards be renowned as an infantry commander. During the destruction of the Takeda in 1582 (due to Oda/Tokugawa alliance), Tadamoto had led a relief force to the Takato Castle. Throughout Tadamoto's attempt however, he ended up being cut down by an enemy vassal, thus ending his life.|$|R
50|$|In 1185, a small force led by Yoshitsune {{lands on}} the island of Shikoku. Yoshitsune plans a {{surprise}} attack from the rear (one more time after the Ichi-no-tani battle) on the Taira stronghold at Yashima. The Taira, thinking that main Minamoto forces attack them, flee to their boats in panic. The Taira warriors shoot arrows at the Yoshitsune’s forces. Noritsune, Kiyomori’s nephew and a commander of the Taira, shoots at Yoshitsune, but Tsuginobu, Yoshitsune’s <b>retainer,</b> <b>dies</b> protecting him from arrows. In a famous passage, a Taira lady in a boat holds a fan as a challenge to the Minamoto warriors and Nasu no Yoichi, a skillful young Minamoto archer, hits the fan with his arrow. During the confused fighting at the shore, Yoshitsune loses his bow and gets it back risking his life. He famously explains {{that he did not want}} the Taira to get that bow (for weak archers) and laugh at him. The Taira are forced to leave Shikoku and retreat to Nagato province (southern tip of Honshū). Before the final naval battle at Dan-no-ura, the Minamoto gain new allies (the head of the Kumano Shrine decides to support the Minamoto after fortune-telling with cockfights (200 boats) and 150 boats from a province of Shikoku). In total, the Minamoto have about 3000 vessels against the Taira’s 1000. Before the battle, Yoshitsune argues (about leading the attack) and almost fights with Kajiwara Kagetoki (Minamoto commander jealous of Yoshitsune). As the battle begins, the Taira are in good spirits and seem to be winning due to skillful positioning of archers on the boats. After the exchange of arrows from a distance main forces begin fighting. Omens from Heaven (white banner descends on a Minamoto boat, many dolphins swim to Taira boats) show that the Minamoto are going to win. Shigeyoshi from Awa province (Shikoku) betrays the Taira and informs the Minamoto about the boats carrying the main Taira forces in disguise. Warriors from Shikoku and Kyūshū also switch sides and support the Minamoto. In the famous and tragic passage, Kiyomori’s widow, holding young Emperor Antoku in her arms, commits suicide by drowning. Many Taira are killed or commit suicide at Dan-no-ura. Tomomori (Kiyomori’s son) drowns himself. Noritsune (Kiyomori’s nephew and a strong warrior) fails to have a fight with Yoshitsune and dies fighting bravely. Taira clan head Munemori, Kenreimon’in (Kiyomori’s daughter) are captured alive. After the battle, Yoshitsune returns to capital with the Imperial Treasures (the sacred sword has been lost) and prisoners. Captured Taira are paraded along the streets of the capital with many spectators pitying their fate. Yoshitsune delivers Munemori to Yoritomo in Kamakura, but after Kajiwara Kagetoki’s slander Yoritomo suspects Yoshitsune of treachery and does not allow him to enter Kamakura. Yoshitsune writes a letter of complaint listing his military deeds and loyal service. Yoritomo still sends him back to the capital. Munemori and his son Kiyomune are executed, their heads hung near a prison gate in the capital. Shigehira (Kiyomori’s son captured at Ichi-no-tani) is allowed to see his wife before being handed over to Nara monks. Shigehira hopes for Amida’s compassion and rebirth in the Pure Land. Warriors execute him in front of the monks. His head is nailed near the temple at Nara. His wife becomes a nun after cremating his head and body.|$|R
