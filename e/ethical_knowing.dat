40|$|In 1978, Carper {{identified}} ‘four fundamental {{patterns of}} knowing’ that became largely foundational to subsequent epistemological discourse within the nursing discipline. These patterns of empirical, personal, aesthetic, and <b>ethical</b> <b>knowing</b> were presented as conceptually distinct yet related patterns of knowing. In {{order to provide}} an alternative conceptualization of aesthetics in nursing, the main tenants of Carper’s discussion of aesthetic knowing will be revisited, and the foundations for her arguments will be examined. Specifically, Dewey’s Art as Experience will be examined {{in relation to the}} ‘holism’ of nursing, and an alternative position on pragmatic aesthetics in nursing will be offered. Apreliminary reintegration of the four patterns of knowing will then be presented as will an example of a potential cultivation of aesthetics in nursing, through an example of Rodin’s 19 th century sculpture, the Burghers of Calais.

40|$|Primary care nurse {{practitioners}} (NPs), working in nursing centers, frequently care for vulnerable {{patients who are}} at increased risk for poor health outcomes and diminished quality of life. Risk and marginalization compound vulnerability and create the context for a variety of ethical issues. Daily exposure to ethical issues leads NPs to become frustrated and stressed. This study explored the ethical issues experienced by primary care NPs caring for vulnerable patients in nursing centers and how they handled these issues. A naturalistic inquiry using a multiple, embedded case study design with cross-case analysis was used. Participants were primary care NPs selected from community-based nursing centers in the Mid-Atlantic States. In-depth interviews, non-participant observation, and document analysis were the methods of data collection. A preliminary typology of ethical issues experienced by primary care NPs caring for vulnerable patients in nursing centers was also induced. Ethical issues were found to occur at different levels within the sociopolitical context of health care delivery. The ability for the NP to change the circumstances resulting in these issues depended upon the level at which they occurred. The Beidler Level of Ethical Issues Framework was inductively derived. Nurse Practitioners handled ethical issues with a stance akin to various ethical principles and theories, however, none of the NPs identified a method of ethical decision making or theoretical framework for their decisions. The possibility that this is related to nurses 2 ̆ 7 ethical knowledge transitioning from a universalistic principle-based ethic to a postmodern relational narrative ethic, consistent with the way in which NPs emphasized the patient-nurse relationship as the foundation of their <b>ethical</b> <b>knowing,</b> needs to be further explored. ...|$|E
40|$|Any {{enterprise}}  {{whether a}} major corporation, a small family-owned business, a public school, a hospital, or a military unit  needs to develop itself continuously {{in order to}} adapt to the challenges originating within itself and from its environment, in relation to its overall purpose or mission. Deliberate development and management of an enterprise manifest complexity that gives rise to a central challenge: how can we obtain a comprehensive intelligibility of an enterprise? One conceptual tool to overcome this challenge is enterprise modeling; it supports articulation of an enterprise and consequently intelligibility of its complexity. In this sense, this dissertation presents four novel contributions to enterprise modeling. The first is a proposal for a notion of the model as such. This distinguishes itself from conventional notions as it incorporates the modeling-subject and its relation to the modeled-object, rather than only accounting for the latter. The second contribution is a proposal for a notion of the modeling process by articulation of its general purpose, outcome, process, and structure. This provides guidelines for deliberate design of modeling process in order to obtain desired quality of the result: the models themselves  this is an aspect that is typically forgotten. The third contribution is a proposal for an enterprise modeling language including a set of enterprise modeling constructs (constituted by semantics and syntaxes) for representing an enterprise; examples are an enterprises Consumer, Output, Process, Organizational Culture, Rules, and Goals. Compared to other current enterprise modeling languages, this language provides a richer set of enterprise constructs supporting generation of higher comprehensiveness of an enterprise. Finally, the fourth contribution is a proposal for a multi-modal enterprise modeling approach; this provides guidelines for construction of enterprise models incorporating enterprise attributes from fifteen distinct areas of human knowing and experience, including numeric, physical, biotic, psychic, economic, aesthetic, and <b>ethical</b> <b>knowing.</b> This proposal supports modeling and consequently also comprehension of enterprises in a multi-disciplinary mode, thus challenging the conventional reductionist, single modal, modeling approaches. The four proposals for enterprise modeling are derived from propositions within Projective Constructivist Epistemology and Multi-Modal Theory and are supported by empirical experience from a set of case studies. Finally, the dissertation presents several questions for further research. One of these proposes the development of a model-driven enterprise. This would be based on conceptual models of itself, where active models operate computer-based enterprise systems. Hypothetically speaking, such a model-driven and technology-based enterprise would be endowed with a cognitive capacity, giving emergence to the potential of manifesting behavior and performance transcending those of conventional enterprises...|$|E
40|$|Passing for Free, Passing for Sovereign {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} narratives of race and gender passing, histories of slavery that these narratives draw upon, and the hetero-nationalist imaginaries that they inform. Much of the scholarship on passing emphasizes the political and affective agency of “passers” to attain social mobility or escape racialized and gendered violence. However, this approach often pre-supposes an individual with autonomous and rational, liberal agency. It also leaves under-examined the accusation of passing itself. In contrast, this dissertation brings to the forefront accusations of passing as techniques of disciplining bodies and regulating populations in order to investigate the political assumptions embedded within them. It points to the ways the passing accusation has been institutionalized {{in a range of}} historical periods and spheres of activity including: positivist science, which centers the human as the knowing and unveiling subject; law and its role in defining free, liberal individuals and their belonging to the nation; and Enlightenment philosophy that posits an ethics based on rational universalism. It concludes by asking after the grounds for an <b>ethical</b> form of <b>knowing</b> not tethered to the anti-black epistemologies of passing but instead rooted in epistemologies of abolition...|$|R

Esthetic and <b>ethical</b> patterns of <b>knowing</b> were particularly useful in implementing the needed education. By employing these patterns of knowing, the student nurses could more accurately plan the most effective approach to teaching this new mother, in an approach based upon empathy as well as expertise. Case Meredith is a 17 -year-old female, gravida 1, para 1 who spontaneously delivered a baby girl vaginally at 1 : 00 pm. She had an epidural during labor. Her birth was augmented with Pitocin.

40|$|Courses in {{business}} ethics 3 {{are part of}} most Higher Education programmes in Management and Business Studies. Such courses are commonly aimed at providing students with knowledge about ethics, usually {{in the form of}} a set of ethical and meta-ethical theories which are presented as ‘tools’ for ethical decision making. This reveals an approach to the teaching of management and business ethics which is based upon a cognitive view of moral education – one which sees ethical knowledge as at least a necessary condition for moral action – and in which it is assumed that ethical practice in management and business follows from the application of ethical knowledge. In this paper we ask whether the teaching of management and business ethics can be done differently and, more importantly, whether it can be done in an ethical manner, one which focuses on possibilities for being <b>ethical</b> rather than <b>knowing</b> ethics. Our explorations are informed by the work of Emmanuel Levinas and centre on the idea that responsibility is the first reality of the (ethical) self. Through a discussion of the notions of ‘the face’ and ‘the third part’ (le tiers) we explore how ethical subjectivity might be possible. We then ask what it might mean to organise a curriculum for management and business ethics around the ‘experience’ of responsibility-for-the-Other...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} {{our culture is}} {{grounded}} in fundamental ontological error. This error posits human being {{as a form of}} being that is separate from the other-than-human world, its mortal and fleshy confines. Drawing on the insight of Gregory Bateson, I propose that insofar as ontology and epistemology are inextricably entwined, error in one implies error in the other. Thus the consequence of our faulty ontology is that epistemological error is built into the system. The danger of systemic epistemological error is that, as a culture, we rely on our ways of knowing to find solutions to cultural/social/ecological problems. Yet where our ways of knowing are themselves erroneous, recourse to these, simply further perpetuates problems {{and at the same time}} deepens error. This is particularly the case where recourse to systemic correctives to such error have been lost – where <b>ethical</b> <b>knowing</b> (at the level of culture) and a perspective giving and defining relationship with nature and the sacred are not available to the system. Where these correctives are not available, the dominant knowing multiplies, a spreading pandemic across the landscape, suppressing and eradicating other ways of knowing and thus, other ways of being. A key result of this is the diminishing capacity, at the level of culture, to detect this epistemological (and ontological) error. The norm quickly overwrites difference, removing alternative knowing from the system. This has resulted in a condition in late modernity whereby the separation of ways of knowing and being from embededness in place are all but undetected in our cultural psyche. Ecological and epistemological destruction thus continue fundamentally unchecked. This thesis traces the loss of awareness of loss through shifts in, what I term, the epistemological baseline. An overlooked dimension of this ecological and epistemological change is the impact that loss of knowing has on the self. This loss, has, I propose, produced a collective and heightened existential anxiety, a loss of the sense that the self in any meaningful way exists. As a result, the late-modern self is caught in the endless search for proof – looking for evidence of existence through the given cultural form - material reflections, particularly images, of the self. Such evidence, however, merely reproduces the search for, and the dominance of, ‘objective’ knowledge and the reign of the object, ultimately producing the impermeable self. This process of self-referencing has over the last thirty to forty years been a matter of some theoretical scrutiny. Yet this conversation is one that has, primarily, been separated from conversations surrounding ecological destruction and diminished relationship with the other-than-human world. The making and mapping of the self is seen to bear no inherent relation to the destruction of species and of place. Where a connection is made it is material. Further, this is a materiality that is stripped bare of all subjectivity and presence. Hence we find most of the mainstream discourse and much environmental and cultural theory linking our habits of consumption to ideas of unsustainability but not to the effects this has on ways of being or knowing oneself as human. In this, the other-than-human world as the core constituent of our human being, (and our potential to know of this being) is absent, forgotten, lost. In revealing the limitations of cultural and environmental theory and protest, due to their historical locatedness in (and thus tendency to reproduce) epistemological error, I draw attention to the way in which ecological destruction and the loss of subjectivity are caught in a self-reinforcing, positive feedback loop which is taking us towards epistemological crisis. In this crisis we are trapped in a systemic failure to know of error and thus a failure to know otherwise, and as a system, we are heading not towards recovery but death...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} mediality is a {{fundamental}} question about our structures of perception. First of all, it‘s a question about imaginable and questionable fields of perception. It‘s genesis of language and essential concept in Nietzsches theory – „power of will“. In one way we see problem of knowing: true’s and falsilities, images of apparent and true world, it‘s the main aspect {{of what we call}} illusion, appearances of things in themselves and immediate certainty. It‘s always semantic fields: where sign is created to be a significant reference of what we call meaning structures.

Otherwise, we see only affects and tragedy: pain of annihilated mind of knowledge in a form of anthropomorphisms, languages and images as metaphorical activity...|$|R
40|$|What {{makes an}} ethical {{question}} “hard”? Monroe Freedman’s “Professional Responsibility of the Criminal Defense Lawyer: The Three Hardest Questions” assessed hard questions about discrediting truthful witnesses, presenting perjured testimony and providing advice that may prompt {{the client to}} lie. It also, however, created a framework for analyzing <b>ethical</b> problems, for <b>knowing</b> when a question is hard, and both {{what has to be}} done to answer a hard question and to defend the answer. This paper articulates that framework. It argues that hard questions arise from unresolvable conflicts either between the lawyer’s professional and personal moral obligations, or between different aspects of the lawyer’s professional duties – the duty of fidelity to law and the duty to be a loyal and zealous advocate for a client. The question requires the lawyer to make a choice in which a moral obligation will have to be sacrificed for another one to be fulfilled. While Freedman answers the hard questions he identifies, his point is ultimately that a lawyer must make a conscientious choice as to how to respond to a hard question in the specific circumstances in which the question arises, and be prepared to defend that choice. The paper further develops this analysis by applying the framework to argue that one of the hardest questions for criminal defence lawyers is whether or not to advise a client to accept a plea, where the client ought to have a reasonable chance of acquittal if receiving a fair trial on the merits, but the plea is clearly in the client’s best interests given the potential sentence and the improbability of receiving a fair trial...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{explores the}} ways in which metaphysics, positioned at the intersections of essence/language/logic, both forms and informs certain ontological questions in a post-Cartesian universe. Central to my philosophical inquiry are animals: animals as trope and animals as speaking subjects. ^ As a philosophy of language, it does not aim to produce results so much as to engage in the process of reflecting back on the toward itself, on {{the ways in}} which writing, making, thinking and doing take place. As a feminist philosophy of language, its critique of representation and subjectivity are focused on the epistemological revelations of ethics and/in discursive practice. Throughout I will argue that animal shapes and animal language are as sliding signifiers; language use alone is unreliable as proof of the rationality of man. ^ Specifically, for naturalist Annie Dillard, poet-cum-social scientist Vicki Hearne and theologian Mary Daly, interspecial communication is in some way acknowledged as a language of human possibility. Each woman speaks philosophically about the world and our relationship to it; her literary and philosophical explorations are then organized according to certain conceptual comprehensions. In my reading of Dillard, words illuminate experience; reading Hearne, the focus is on grammars. For Daly, spinners write rhetorics in the webs of the Wickedary. ^ My assumption has been that the presence of animal/forms in the emerging philosophies of these three twentieth-century women writers has had something to say about how all kinds of non- and extra-philosophical activities become the bases for philosophical reflection. Further, I have assumed that each of these writer/philosophers is important because each recognizes in her own way the problem of language and the <b>ethical</b> dimensions of <b>knowing.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Whole exome {{sequencing}} {{is currently}} {{used for the}} diagnosis of genetic conditions in pediatric and adult patients. Prenatal genetic testing is commonplace, but clinical prenatal whole exome sequencing is currently not available by commercial laboratories. Controversy surrounds the <b>ethical</b> issues of <b>knowing</b> a fetus’s genetic future and the implications it could have for termination and family planning. While ongoing discussion occurs whether prenatal whole exome sequencing should be offered, there are no studies assessing parental opinions of prenatal whole exome sequencing. A questionnaire focusing on this was distributed to individuals that were pursuing first trimester genetic screening. The results of the questionnaire were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results showed that 83. 1 % of participants thought prenatal whole exome sequencing should be offered and 53. 5 % (with an additional 40. 1 % neutral) were interested in having prenatal whole exome sequencing for their fetus. Only 17. 2 % of participants responded {{that they would be}} willing to have amniocentesis in order to have prenatal whole exome sequencing, and 30. 6 % were neutral towards amniocentesis. The vast majority of participants were interested in receiving all types of results, including: conditions of childhood and adult onset that are treatable, non-treatable, and that may shorten lifespan. In regards to family planning, 60. 1 % of participants stated the results of prenatal whole exome sequencing may affect their family planning if they are at risk to have a future child with a health problem, and 32. 8 % (with 20. 2 % neutral) stated that results of prenatal whole exome sequencing may affect their decision to continue the pregnancy. The majority of participants (59. 7 %) preferred a maximum turnaround time of three weeks or less for prenatal whole exome sequencing which is much shorter than currently reported turnaround times. Although interest is expressed for prenatal whole exome sequencing, the current available technologies for fetal DNA capture and whole exome sequencing turnaround time is not desirable for expectant parents. The public health significance of this study is that prenatal whole exome sequencing will likely become clinically available as technologies continue to improve. Understanding the public’s views on the testing is important in order to predict uptake and any perceived barriers...|$|R
