5|$|At {{the end of}} June 1860, Rossier was in Shanghai, and it {{is likely}} that he visited the city in an attempt to gain {{permission}} to accompany the Anglo-French military expedition that had already arrived in northern China and thereby fulfill his commission to document the Second Opium War.

The British forces were accompanied by the photographers Felice Beato and John Papillon, and the French by Antoine Fauchery, Lieutenant-Colonel Du Pin, and possibly also by Louis Legrand.

5|$|Despite these advances, {{movable type}} {{printing}} never gained {{the amount of}} widespread use <b>in</b> <b>East</b> <b>Asia</b> that woodblock printing had achieved since the Chinese Tang Dynasty in the 9th century. With written Chinese, the vast amount of written morpheme characters impeded movable type's acceptance and practical use, and was therefore seen as largely unsatisfactory. Furthermore, the European printing press, first invented by Johannes Gutenberg (1398–1468), was eventually wholly adopted as the standard in China, yet the tradition of woodblock printing remains popular in East Asian countries still.|$|E
5|$|Earlier {{hypotheses}} of the epidemic's origin have varied. Some hypothesized the flu originated <b>in</b> <b>East</b> <b>Asia.</b> Dr. C.

He considered several other hypotheses of origin, such as Spain, Kansas, and Brest, as being possible, but not likely.|$|E
