40|$|Previously, we {{have shown}} that gel-forming triblock proteins, {{consisting}} of random coil middle blocks and trimer-forming (Pro-Gly-Pro) (9) <b>end</b> <b>blocks,</b> are efficiently produced and secreted by the yeast Pichia pastoris. These <b>end</b> <b>blocks</b> had a melting temperature (T (m)) of ~ 41 °C (at 1. 1 ¿mM of protein). The present work reveals that an increase of T (m) to ~ 74 °C, obtained by extension of the <b>end</b> <b>blocks</b> to (Pro-Gly-Pro) (16), resulted in a five times lower yield and partial endoproteolytic degradation of the protein. A possible cause {{could be that the}} higher thermostability of the longer (Pro-Gly-Pro) (16) trimers leads to a higher incidence of trimers in the cell, and that this disturbs secretion of the protein. Alternatively, the increased length of the proline-rich (Pro-Gly-Pro) (n) domain may negatively influence ribosomal translation, or may result in, for example, hydrophobic aggregation or membrane-active behavior owing to the greater number of closely placed proline residues. To discriminate between these possibilities, we studied the production of molecules with randomized <b>end</b> <b>blocks</b> that are unable to form triple helices. The codon- and amino acid composition of the genes and proteins, respectively, remained unchanged. As these nontrimerizing molecules were secreted intact and at high yield, we conclude that the impaired secretion and partial degradation of the triblock with (Pro-Gly-Pro) (16) <b>end</b> <b>blocks</b> was triggered by the occurrence of intracellular triple helices. This degradation was overcome by using a yapsin 1 protease disruptant, and the intact secreted polymer was capable of forming self-supporting gels of high thermal stability...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{last several}} years have {{witnessed}} exciting progress {{in the development of}} immunotherapy for the treatment of cancer. This has been due in great part to the development of so-called checkpoint blockade. That is, antibodies that block inhibitory receptors such as CTLA- 4 and PD- 1 and thus unleash antigen-specific immune responses against tumors. It is clear that tumors evade the immune response by usurping pathways that play a role in negatively regulating normal immune responses. In this regard, adenosine in the immune microenvironment leading to the activation of the A 2 a receptor has been shown to represent one such negative feedback loop. Indeed, the tumor microenvironment has relatively high concentrations of adenosine. To this <b>end,</b> <b>blocking</b> A 2 a receptor activation has the potential to markedly enhance anti-tumor immunity in mouse models. This review will present data demonstrating the ability of A 2 a receptor blockade to enhance tumor vaccines, checkpoint blockade and adoptive T cell therapy. Also, as several recent studies have demonstrated that under certain conditions A 2 a receptor blockade can enhance tumor progression, we will also explore the complexities of adenosine signaling in the immune response. Despite important nuances to the A 2 a receptor pathway that require further elucidation, studies to date strongly support the development of A 2 a receptor antagonists (some of which have already been tested in phase III clinical trials for Parkinson Disease) as novel modalities in the immunotherapy armamentarium...|$|E

40|$|Background Single-stranded oligonucleotides (ssODN) can induce {{site-specific}} genetic {{alterations in}} selected mammalian cells, but the involved mechanisms are not known. Methods We corroborate {{the potential of}} genomic sequence correction by ssODN using chromosomally integrated mutated enhanced green fluorescent protein (mEGFP) reporter genes in CHO cell lines. The role of integration site was studied in a panel of cell clones with randomly integrated reporters and in cell lines with site-specific single copy integration of the mEGFP reporter in opposite orientations. Involvement of end modification was examined on ssODN with unprotected or phosphorothioate (PS) protected ends. Also ssODN containing octyl or hexaethylene glycol (HEG) <b>end</b> <b>blocking</b> groups were tested. The significance of DNA synthesis was investigated by cell cycle analysis and by the DNA polymerases alpha, delta and epsilon inhibitor aphidicolin. Results Correction rates of up to 5 % were observed upon a single transfection of ssODN. Independent of the mEGFP chromosomal integration site and of its orientation towards the replication fork, antisense ssODN were more effective than sense ssODN. When ssODN ends were blocked by either octyl or HEG groups, correction rates were reduced. Finally, we demonstrate a dependence of the process on DNA synthesis. Conclusions We show that, on a chromosomal level, {{the orientation of the}} replication fork towards the targeted locus is not central in the strand bias of ssODN-based targeted sequence correction. We demonstrate the importance of accessible ssODN ends for sequence alteration. Finally, we provide evidence for the involvement of DNA synthesis in the process...|$|E
40|$|In {{previous}} equilibrium binding studies, Dictyostelium discoideum plasma membranes {{have been}} shown to bind actin and to recruit actin into filaments at the membrane surface. However, {{little is known about the}} kinetic pathway(s) through which actin assembles at these, or other, membranes. We have used actin fluorescently labeled with N-(1 - pyrenyl) iodoacetamide to examine the kinetics of actin assembly in the presence of D. discoideum plasma membranes. We find that these membranes increase the rate of actin polymerization. The rate of membrane-mediated actin polymerization is linearly dependent on membrane protein concentrations up to 20 micrograms/ml. Nucleation (the association of activated actin monomers into oligomers) appears to be the primary step of polymerization that is accelerated. A sole effect on the initial salt-induced actin conformational change (activation) is ruled out because membranes accelerate the polymerization of pre- activated actin as well as actin activated in the presence of membranes. Elongation of preexisting filaments also is not the major step of polymerization facilitated by membranes since membranes stripped of all peripheral components, including actin, increase the rate of actin assembly to about the same extent as do membranes containing small amounts of endogenous actin. Acceleration of the nucleation step by membranes also is supported by an analysis of the dependence of polymerization lag time on actin concentration. The barbed ends of membrane-induced actin nuclei are not obstructed by the membranes because the barbed <b>end</b> <b>blocking</b> agent, cytochalasin D, reduces the rate of membrane-mediated actin nucleation. Similarly, the pointed ends of the nuclei are not blocked by membranes since the depolymerization rate of gelsolin-capped actin is unchanged in the presence of membranes. These results are consistent with previous observations of lateral interactions between membranes and actin filaments. These results also are consistent with two predictions from a model based on equilibrium binding studies; i. e., that plasma membranes should nucleate actin assembly and that membrane-bound actin nuclei should have both ends free (Schwartz, M. A., and E. J. Luna. 1988. J. Cell Biol. 107 : 201 - 209). Integral membrane proteins mediate the actin nucleation activity because activity is eliminated by heat denaturation, treatment with reducing agents, or proteolysis of membranes. Activity also is abolished by solubilization with octylglucoside but is reconstituted upon removal or dilution of the detergent. Ponticulin, the major actin-binding protein in plasma membranes, appears to be necessary for nucleation activity since activity is not reconstituted from detergent extracts depleted of ponticulin...|$|E

Formation of triple helices occurs in two steps: nucleation and propagation.

With increasing concentration, propagation of triple helix becomes rate-limiting.
