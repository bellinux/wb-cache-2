One of these devices was to injure a future Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff - Colin Powell. Another type of trap was a spiked mud ball that swung <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> victim after a trip wire release, impaling him.

25|$|These {{conflicts}} put {{an enormous}} {{strain on the}} resources of the Republic, however, and for that reason the Republic (like its opponent, the France of Louis XIV) was deeply in debt {{at the end of the}} War of the Spanish Succession. The regents of the Republic more or less abandoned its Great-Power pretensions after 1713, cutting <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> military preparedness in a vain attempt to pay down this overhang of public debt. That debt brought a significant rentier class into being that helped change the nature of the economy from one invested primarily in trade and industry into one in which a significant financial sector played a dominant role. By the end of the 18th century the Republic was the major market for sovereign debt, and a major source of foreign direct investment.|$|E
25|$|It {{had been}} rumored that Harel Skaat {{would be the}} 2009 Israeli Eurovision entrant.

This legal dispute, however, ended in failure, putting Skaat out of the running for Eurovision. Marina Maximillian Blumin had been revealed as a possibility for the IBA's committee after Skaat's failure, but could only head to Moscow if she could resolve issues with her current military service. Maya Bouskilla had also been revealed as a possibility, she was also enlisted in the Israeli army as of May 2008.|$|E
25|$|Following the Iranian Revolution, Bahraini Shia fundamentalists in 1981 orchestrated {{a failed}} coup attempt {{under the auspices}} of a front organisation, the Islamic Front for the Liberation of Bahrain. The coup would have {{installed}} a Shia cleric exiled in Iran, Hujjat al-Islam Hādī al-Mudarrisī, as supreme leader heading a theocratic government. The Bahraini government unofficially regarded the coup as Iran attempting to overthrow their Sunni government. Iran denied all knowledge saying the fundamentalists were inspired by the Iranian revolution but had received no support from Iran. Fearful of a recurrence, the episode caused Bahrain to crack <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> Shia population putting thousands into jail and further souring relations with Shia Iran. Recently the countries are beginning to enjoy closer relations again and have engaged in many joint economic ventures. Iran has been severely critical of Bahrain hosting the US navy Fifth Fleet within the Persian Gulf.|$|E

[...] Ingram, who rushed for 37 yards on the drive, scored on a 1-yard touchdown run early in the fourth quarter to increase Bama's lead to 32–13. Florida mounted a late drive that reached the Alabama 6 before Tebow threw an interception to Javier Arenas in the end zone. [...] On Florida's next possession, the Gators turned the ball over on downs at the Alabama 13, and the Tide was able to run out the clock to secure the 32–13 victory.|$|E
500|$|The two {{modified}} {{cars were}} prepared for the Swedish Grand Prix at Anderstorp on 17 June 1978, for Niki Lauda and John Watson. When not in use, the fan was covered by a dustbin lid, but {{it soon became clear}} what the modified Brabham was intended to achieve: when the drivers blipped the throttle, the car could be seen to squat <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> suspension as the downforce increased. Lotus driver Mario Andretti said [...] "It is like a bloody great vacuum cleaner. It throws muck and rubbish at you at a hell of a rate". Murray says that this was untrue: [...] "The fan couldn't spit anything out the back because the fan e-flux [...] was only 55mph. Besides the radial fan would have sent any stones flying sideways". The legality of the cars was soon protested, but they were allowed to race. They qualified second and third behind championship leader Andretti. In the race, Watson spun off on the 19th lap. Once a back-marker dropped oil onto the track and with both major front-runners out the race, the remaining Brabham was in a class of its own, seemingly unaffected by the slippery surface. Lauda passed Andretti around the outside of one of the corners, who dropped out shortly afterwards due to a broken valve, and went on to win by over half a minute from Riccardo Patrese in an Arrows.|$|E

500|$|San Lorenzo Colossal Head6 (also {{known as}} San Lorenzo Monument17) {{is one of}} the smaller {{examples}} of colossal heads, standing [...] It measures [...] wide by [...] deep and is estimated to weigh between 8 and 10 tons. The head was discovered by a local farmworker and was excavated in 1965 by Luis Aveleyra and Román Piña Chan. The head had collapsed into a ravine under its own weight and was found face <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> left hand side. In 1970 it was transported to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York for the museum's centenary exhibition. After its return to Mexico, it was placed in the Museo Nacional de Antropología in Mexico City. It is sculpted with a net-like head covering joined together with sculpted beads. A covering descends from under the headdress to cover the back half of the neck. The headband is divided into four strips and begins above the right ear, extending around the entire head. A short strap descends from either side of the head to the ear. The ear ornaments are complex and are larger {{at the front of the}} ear than at the back. The face is that of an ageing male with the forehead creased in a frown, wrinkles under the eyes, sagging cheeks and deep creases on either side of the nose. The face is somewhat asymmetric, possibly due to errors in the execution of the monument.|$|E
500|$|While {{the first}} five seasons of the series were mainly filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, {{production}} of the show's sixth season was based in Los Angeles, California. The scenes {{taking place in the}} hangar were filmed at the Marine Corps Air Station Tustin in Tustin, California. The hangar, constructed in 1942 as an airship base, {{is one of the largest}} all-wooden hangars in the United States. Bill Roe, director of photography, and Rob Bowman were tasked with lighting the entire structure for the episode's teaser and climax, a job that Spotnitz later called [...] "amazing". He noted that, after the series' move to Los Angeles, production costs had risen, forcing the show to cut <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> [...] "astonishing production values". However, he applauded the use of the hangar, noting that it [...] "was a way to try and create that cinematic scale and still keep [...] affordable". The episode also revisits trains as a setting, something that had previously been done in the third season episodes [...] "731" [...] and [...] "Nisei". However, for budgetary reasons, the scenes taking place on the trains did not take up much screen time. To give the effect that the train carrying Cassandra Spender is moving at a high speed, Manners utilized [...] "sound effects, music, clever camera angles and quick cutting". In reality, the train was never moving faster than eight miles an hour.|$|E

So how many times can we afford to charge the horses each day knowing we need to give time for a reset that's 10 times longer than the actual shot? Another thing was how to make 500 extras look like 8,000 when you are shooting in a field where there's just nowhere to hide your shortfall. It becomes a bit like a bonkers math equation. And finally: How do you get these guys riled up enough to run at each other and get covered in mud and stand in the rain and then run at each other again and again for 25 days, 10 hours a day, without them just telling you to piss off?" [...] In an interview, he said that the single most difficult thing he was asked to depict was [...] "having 3,000 horses running at each other, especially after we discovered that horses cannot touch each other. It’s illegal — it’s a very valid rule about protecting the horses. So the very thing we were trying to do was not allowed. And we only had 70 horses ... you would have one guy run into the frame, and then the horse rider would pull the horse, which means make the horse fall and lie <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> side. Later we would digitally superimpose another C.G.I. horse and make it seem like it had impacted the live one." ...|$|E
