Death may be tragic but it is commonplace, the eternal Truth. Let's not trumpet it, but place it simply before the public and let them make up their own minds. I would so like the feeling that we generate on the air to reflect the reality of death in life: {{most of the time it}} is a very quiet, private affair, generates little public attention: we grieve, and then somehow or other we just <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> with things. I suppose at the risk of sounding squirmingly precious, I would like Victor to die with dignity.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Q magazine, lead singer Chris Martin stated that [...] "In My Place" [...] was a song Coldplay had left after recording their debut album Parachutes (2000). When the band finished recording their second album A Rush of Blood to the Head, Martin said that the album was complete. However, after guitarist Jonny Buckland played the song on his guitar, Martin said that they now needed to record it and include it on the album. Martin also said that: [...] "That's about where you're put in the world, and how you're given your position, {{and the way you}} look, and how you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> with it." [...] In {{an interview}}, Buckland revealed that the song was hard to record, as the band had played the song live. He also commented that when they started recording the song, they did not know how it should sound, due to the band members' contrasting ideas.|$|E
2500|$|During {{this time}} Adams {{continued}} {{to write and}} submit sketches, though few were accepted. In 1976 his career had a brief improvement when he wrote and performed Unpleasantness at Brodie's Close at the Edinburgh Fringe festival. By Christmas, work had dried up again, and a depressed Adams moved {{to live with his}} mother. The lack of writing work hit him hard and low confidence became a feature of Adams's life; [...] "I have terrible periods of lack of confidence [...] I briefly did therapy, but after a while I realised it was like a farmer complaining about the weather. You can't fix the weather– you just <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> with it".|$|E
6000|$|Charmian shivered with {{enjoyment}} of the romantic situation. She reached a hand behind her and tried to clutch one of Cornelia's but <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> without it. [...] "And well: have they met?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Financial {{problems}} forced Ealing Studios to {{wind down}} from 1955 onwards, and close later in the decade. Slocombe said of the period in 2015 that [...] "we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> with our careers - there was little time for sentiment." ...|$|R
50|$|The clue {{received}} instructed {{them to go}} to McGregor Point where teams <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> {{a personal}} water craft and ride 1 mi along a marked path in search of a field of one hundred buoys. They then <b>had</b> <b>to</b> search the buoys for one of four that had their next clue attached.|$|R
2500|$|Ian—Ian McBain is a 14-year-old from Ajax, Ontario. Interested {{in animals}} and the {{outdoors}} and seeking {{a career as a}} biologist, McBain was inspired to audition for the second season after seeing the first season episode Swamp: [...] "The episode from the first season that really motivated me to try to get on the show was the swamp episode. [...] "Most people would think 'Oh gross. a swamp, there's leeches and stuff.' That was the turning point for me, I was like 'I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> this show, that looks so fun, so many different experiences.' He was dubbed [...] "The Book Worm" [...] McBain, who admits to being an unadventurous [...] "wimp", says that he learned to trust other people and believe in himself during the show. For him, the toughest part of the series was getting through the nights and worrying about wild animal attacks.|$|E
2500|$|His {{first goal}} of the season came in a 3–0 win at Yeovil Town on 24 August, which was quickly {{followed}} up by his first career hat-trick in a 5–1 win at Millwall on 14 September, which {{was also the first}} league hat-trick by a Derby player since Paul Simpson in April 1996. After a 1–0 defeat at Nottingham Forest, with the club having won only once in the last six matches, having failed to win at home, and lying in 14th place, manager Nigel Clough was sacked. Bryson was saddened by the move, saying it came as a [...] "shock", adding that Clough [...] "has been excellent for me, he brought me down from Scotland and gave me my chance in England. So obviously I was sad to see him go. But it happens in football and you just <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> with it." [...] Clough was replaced by Steve McClaren and Bryson said that he was looking forward to working with the new manager.|$|E

50|$|The next day, Sid's mom {{gives him}} a lift to college, and tries to tell him {{something}} but is unable to. She tells him he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> better with his dad. Sid, concerned that Michelle skived off history, calls her and arranges to meet her in a club. Cassie overhears the conversation and is distraught.|$|R
6000|$|Of {{course she}} was. Mr. Bucket {{must return to}} a little work he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> with upstairs, but he must shake hands with Mercury in {{acknowledgment}} of his agreeable conversation, and will he--this is all he asks--will he, when he has a leisure half-hour, think of bestowing it on that Royal Academy sculptor, for the advantage of both parties? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, {{we had a}} {{nice job}} with that," [...] he answered. [...] "The second sick ox died, and so did another, and we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> as best we could with three {{harnessed}} unicorn fashion, while we pushed behind. We did about four miles a day, and it took us nearly a month, {{during the last week}} of which we pretty well starved." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir! There's been no transit by Tanooda {{for three}} days. It {{is no good}} waiting. We shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> {{as well as we}} can." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Business, nowadays, is--business, Holder. The Juggernaut car claims us all. It has become-if {{you will}} {{permit me to}} {{continue}} to put my similes into slang--the modern band wagon. And we lawyers <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> it, or fall by the wayside." ...|$|E

50|$|Around the 100 mile marker on the {{northbound}} {{side are}} two ghost ramps that were specifically {{built for the}} Boy Scouts of America in order <b>to</b> <b>have</b> access <b>to</b> Moraine State Park without <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> U.S. Route 422 for the 1973 and 1977 National Scout Jamborees, which were held at Moraine.

5000|$|They ordered {{us where}} to {{position}} ourselves, {{how we should}} sit, because Claudia operated the cameras wherever you were. When the phone rang {{you knew it was}} Claudia who was watching who was coming in, who <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> the phone, if you were standing, if you <b>had</b> gone <b>to</b> the bathroom a lot, because they monitored even the times you went to the bathroom. Everything was monitored.|$|R

60|$|As soon as {{they had}} turned {{the corner of the}} wall, in view of the tomb and the Khalifa's house, a brisk fire was opened by the garrison. Fortunately, the wall was not loopholed, and they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> the top of it, or on to the flat roofs of the houses, to fire. Maxwell's men soon silenced them, and on the troops passing in through the breaches, and along the wall, most of the Dervishes at once surrendered.|$|R

6000|$|... "Beaten! I {{should think}} not," [...] Godfrey said. [...] "Nobody is beaten with us, though I {{think it would}} be a capital thing if, instead of {{shutting}} up people in prison for small crimes, they had a good flogging. It would do them a deal more good, and it would be better for their wives and families, who <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> as best they can while they are shut up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, well, then I shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> as best I {{can with}} that fellow Mortimer.

Still, if you won't ... well, I think I'll be getting along to his stateroom. I told him I would look in for a last rehearsal." ...|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} Tolly, <b>having</b> managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> his feet stood beside his friend, on whom he gazed with intense anxiety. Even the Indians were solemnised by what {{appeared}} to be a death-scene.|$|R

60|$|BLENKINSOP [putting {{his fingers}} in his ears] No, no: it's no use. I know what youre going to say: Ive said it often to others.

6000|$|... "And do {{you really}} mean that we are to cross by the steamer, Mr. Virtue, while you go over in the Seabird? I do not approve of that at all.

I call it horrid, after a {{fortnight}} on board this dear little yacht, to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> to a crowded steamer, with no accommodation and lots of seasick women, perhaps, and crying children. You surely cannot be in earnest?" ...|$|E

6000|$|Dryer and dryer; {{the very}} leaves smelt of saw-dust; till at last I drank some water, and went at it again.

I wondered whether Mr. Jones had ever read the volume himself; and could not help remembering, that he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> a chair when he reached it down from its dusty shelf; that certainly looked suspicious.|$|R
