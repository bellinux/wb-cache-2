5|$|Adaptation {{may cause}} either the gain {{of a new}} feature, or the loss of an ancestral feature. An example that shows both types of change is {{bacterial}} adaptation to antibiotic selection, with genetic changes causing antibiotic resistance by both modifying {{the target of the}} drug, or increasing the activity of transporters that pump the drug out of the cell. Other striking examples are the bacteria Escherichia coli <b>evolving</b> the ability to use citric acid as a nutrient in a long-term laboratory experiment, Flavobacterium <b>evolving</b> a novel enzyme that allows these bacteria to grow on the by-products of nylon manufacturing, and the soil bacterium Sphingobium <b>evolving</b> an entirely new metabolic pathway that degrades the synthetic pesticide pentachlorophenol. An interesting but still controversial idea is that some adaptations might increase the ability of organisms to generate genetic diversity and adapt by natural selection (increasing organisms' evolvability).|$|E
5|$|During {{the ensuing}} 75 million years, plants evolved {{a range of}} more complex organs – from roots to seeds. There was a gap of 50 to 100 million years between each organ <b>evolving,</b> and it being fed upon. Hole feeding and skeletonization are {{recorded}} in the early Permian, with surface fluid feeding <b>evolving</b> {{by the end of}} that period.|$|E
5|$|Experts {{disagree}} {{over whether}} temnospondyls were ancestral to modern amphibians (frogs, salamanders, and caecilians), {{or whether the}} whole group died out without leaving any descendants. Different hypotheses have placed modern amphibians as the descendants of temnospondyls, another group of early tetrapods called lepospondyls, or even as descendants of both groups (with caecilians <b>evolving</b> from lepospondyls and frogs and salamanders <b>evolving</b> from temnospondyls). Recent studies place a family of temnospondyls called the amphibamids as the closest relatives of modern amphibians. Similarities in teeth, skulls, and hearing structures link the two groups.|$|E
50|$|Yehi {{made his}} <b>Evolve</b> debut at <b>Evolve</b> 51 losing to Lio Rush.

At <b>Evolve</b> 55 he lost to Anthony Nese in a four-way match. At <b>Evolve</b> 56, Yehi joined Catch Point after {{a loss to}} Drew Gulak. At <b>Evolve</b> 61, Yehi lost a WWE Cruiserweight Classic qualifying match to T.J. Perkins. Yehi defeated Anthony Nese at <b>Evolve</b> 62 after applying a Koji Clutch after Nese attempted a 450 Splash, this was Yehi's first win in <b>Evolve.</b> At <b>Evolve</b> 65, Catch Point defeat Jonathan Gresham, Darby Allin and Chris Dickinson. At <b>Evolve</b> 73, Yehi and Tracy Williams became the <b>Evolve</b> tag team champions {{for the first time}} after defeating Chris Hero (replacement for Drew Galloway) and DUSTIN, Tony Nese and Drew Gulak, and The Gatekeepers. Catch Point successfully defended the <b>Evolve</b> Tag Team titles at <b>Evolve</b> 74, defeating Peter Kaasa and Ricochet.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Evolved</b> gas {{analysis}} (EGA) {{is a method}} used to study the gas <b>evolved</b> from a heated sample that undergoes decomposition or desorption. It is either possible just to detect <b>evolved</b> gases using <b>evolved</b> gas detection (EGD) or to analyse explicitly which gases <b>evolved</b> using <b>evolved</b> {{gas analysis}} (EGA).

5|$|Burne-Jones's {{paintings}} were one strand in the <b>evolving</b> tapestry of Aestheticism from the 1860s through the 1880s, which considered that art should be valued {{as an object}} of beauty engendering a sensual response, rather than for the story or moral implicit in the subject matter. In many ways this was antithetical to the ideals of Ruskin and the early Pre-Raphaelites.|$|E
5|$|<b>Evolving</b> {{even further}} from metalcore comes mathcore, a more rhythmically {{complicated}} and progressive style {{brought to light}} by bands such as The Dillinger Escape Plan, Converge, and Protest the Hero.
