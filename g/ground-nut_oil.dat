Despite the general politeness and {{attention}} to us, we found a gloom overhanging the place: as at Whydah, its glories have departed, nor shall they ever return. The jollity, the recklessness, the gold ounces thrown in handfuls upon the monte-table, are things of the past: several houses {{are said to be}} insolvent, and the dearth of cloth is causing actual misery. Palm and <b>ground-nut</b> <b>oil</b> enable the agents only to buy provisions; the trade is capable of infinite expansion, but it requires time--as yet it supports only the two non-slaving houses, English and Dutch. The forty or fifty tons brought in every month pay them cent, per cent.; the bag of half a hundred weight being sold for four fathoms of cloth; or two hatchets, one bottle of rum, and a jug or a plate.|$|E
3000|$|... (Rufino and {{co-workers}} 2007) studied {{the cultivation of}} Candida lipolytica grown on ground nut oil for production of a new biosurfactant. The preliminary investigation of chemical composition suggested it was a lipopeptide in nature. The biosurfactant had a yield of 4.5 g/l and exhibited good surface activity, emulsification ability and can withstand high salt concentration but was not thermo stable. They later also applied sequential factorial design to optimize biosurfactant production by Candida lipolytica using soybean oil refinery residue as substrate (Rufino et al. 2008). In this study they evaluated the impact of three cultivation factors, amounts of refinery residue, glutamic acid and yeast extract. The biosurfactant product showed high surface activity and emulsifying ability and was very stable at wide range of pH (2 - 12), temperatures (0 - 120 °C) and salinity (2 - 10 % NaCl). They concluded that combination of an industrial waste and a cheap substrate is a promising approach to reduce production cost. In another study the same group (Sobrinho et al. 2008) described a low cost medium {{for the production of}} a surfactant by the yeast Candida sphaerica. The medium formulation consisted of distilled water containing 5.0 % groundnut oil refinery residue plus 2.5 % corn steep liquor as substrates. The biosurfactant product had high surface tension reducing activity (26 mN/m), a low CMC value (0.08 %) and a yield of 4.5 gl- 1. The biosurfactant characterized was an anionic glycolipid (consisting of 75 % lipid and 25 % carbohydrate) and was stable at wide temperature, pH and salt level. They concluded {{that it was possible to}} produce biosurfactants from agricultural materials and use them in potential application in oil recovery from sand. (Coimbra et al. 2009) also showed the biosurfactant production by six Candida strains cultivated in insoluble (n-hexadecane) and soluble substrates (soybean oil, <b>ground-nut</b> <b>oil</b> refinery residue, corn steep liquor and glucose). These biosurfactant were able to remove 90 % of the hydrophobic contaminants from sand.|$|E
40|$|Agri-{{products}} {{are defined}} to include products of agriculture & allied activities, fishing, forestry, and manufacturing industries, like food & food products, tobacco, textiles, paper, furniture, etc. Gujarat has a {{revealed comparative advantage}} in the exporting activity over the other states since, as per GITCO Study (November 2001), more than one-fifth of the exports of the country originate from Gujarat. Gujarat has the revealed comparative advantage in <b>ground-nuts,</b> oilmeals, castor <b>oil,</b> poultry & dairy product, spices, sesame & niger seeds, processed food & vegetables & fruits, cotton yarn & fabric, man-made textiles, handicrafts, and cotton raw including waste. Fresh fruits & vegetables, floriculture, and fish are not the areas of strength for Gujarat so far. Based on the large sample survey conducted by GITCO (November 2001), several features of the exports originating from Gujarat are also examined. Exports of agri-products originating from Gujarat represent excess supply rather than exclusive supply to the foreign markets. The prospects of the domestic demand and production of the agricultural sector in Gujarat are examined. The dismal picture of the declining real income in Gujarat agriculture during the late nineties is not supported by several other evidences. On the contrary, Gujarat has a very vibrant and responsive agricultural sector. It has an achievable potential to grow at 4. 5 % to 5 % p. a. over the next 8 to 10 years. The paper concludes by identifying some areas for further research. ...|$|R
6000|$|After a {{pleasant}} breezy night upon the brown waters, on September 1st we hove anchor betimes {{and made for}} Scotchman's Head, a conspicuous mangrove bluff forming a fine landmark on the left bank. The charts have lately shifted it some two miles west of its old position. Six or seven miles beyond it rise the blue uplands of the [...] "Earldom of Sonho." [...] On our right, in mid-stream, lay a [...] "crocodile bank," [...] a newly fixed grass islet, a few square feet of green and gold, which the floods will presently cover or carry away. To the left, above the easternmost [...] "Mombang" [...] and the network of islands behind it, opens the gape of the Malela River, a short cut to French Point, found useful when a dangerous tide- rip {{is caused by the}} strong sea-breeze meeting the violent current of the Thalweg. Above it lies a curious formation like concentric rings of trees inclosing grass: it is visible only from the north-east. Several slave factories now appear on either shore, single-storied huts of wood and thatch, in holes cut out of the densest bush, an impenetrable forest whose sloppy soil and miry puddles seem never to dry. The tenements serve as videttes and outposts, enabling cargoes to ship without the difficulties of passing Palm Point, and thus to make a straight run down stream. There are three on the north bank, viz. M. Rágis (aîné), now deserted, Sr. Lima Viana, and Sr. Antonio Fernandez; and three on the left side, Sr. Alessandro Ferreira, Sr. Guilherme, and Sr. Fonseca. Those on the southern or left bank facilitate overland transit to Mangue, Ambrizette, and other dépôts. At present it is [...] "tiempo seco" [...] (dull time), and the gérants keep their hands in by buying <b>ground-nuts</b> and palm <b>oil.</b> The slave trade, however, makes 500, not 50, per cent., and the agents are naturally fond of it, their mere salaries being only some 150 francs a month.|$|R
