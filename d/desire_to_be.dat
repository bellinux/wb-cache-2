He was considered diffuse and obscure in his utterances and careless in his style, but his abilities were highly regarded, and he came {{to be seen as a}} preeminent authority for the school.|$|E

The second sample (N = 19) was comprised of women who felt and <b>desired</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> their own age. Statistically {{significant differences between the}} groups were that women who felt older reported more physical changes of aging, less satisfaction with their life context, and more worries than the women who felt their chronological age. Results {{of this study suggest that}} current life stress contributes to middle-aged women's perceptions of feeling older and <b>desiring</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> younger than their own age...|$|R

The Act of Uniformity 1662, a law {{requiring}} even greater adherence to the Book of Common Prayer and support for episcopalianism than had previously been required, forced Puritan ministers to leave the Church. Though some presbyterians continued to <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> readmitted to the established church, restrictions on worship for non-conformists led to presbyterians putting aside differences with congregationalists and adopting congregational church orders.|$|E

5|$|After his {{graduation}} in 1947, García Márquez {{stayed in}} Bogotá to study {{law at the}} Universidad Nacional de Colombia, where he had a special dedication to reading. La metamorfosis by Franz Kafka «in the false translation of Jorge Luis Borges» was a work that especially inspired him. He was excited {{with the idea of}} writing, not traditional literature, but a style similar to his grandfather's stories, in which «they inserted extraordinary events and anomalies as if they were simply an aspect of everyday life». His <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a writer grew. A little later, he published his first, La tercera resignación, which appeared in the September 13th, 1947 edition of the newspaper El Espectador.|$|E
5|$|Before the duel, Hamilton wrote {{a defense}} of his {{decision}} to duel {{while at the same}} time intending to throw away his shot. Hamilton viewed his roles of being a father and husband, putting his creditors at risk, placing his family's welfare in jeopardy and his moral and religious stances as reasons not to duel, but he felt it impossible to avoid due to having made attacks on Burr which he was unable to recant, and because of Burr's behavior prior to the duel. He attempted to reconcile his moral and religious reasons and the codes of honor and politics. He intended to accept the duel and throw away his fire in order to satisfy his morals and political codes, respectively. His <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> available for future political matters also played a factor.|$|E

She was replaced by another female drummer, Kytha Gernatt, who was dubbed Cabbage Gomez, Jr. in the press soon after joining the band. Cabbage had previously performed with Kathleen Lynch (a.k.a. Kathleen, a.k.a. Ta-Da the Shit Lady) in the band Easturn Stars; Lynch gained fame as Butthole Surfers' infamous naked dancer from 1986 to 1989. Kramer also left during this period and was replaced by Jeff Pinkus, who gave the band's bass position its longest period of stability by staying until 1994.|$|E

5|$|Hess did {{not build}} a power base or develop a coterie of followers.

He lived in a modest house in Munich. Although Hess had less influence than other top NSDAP officials, he was popular with the masses. After the Invasion of Poland {{and the start of}} World War II in September 1939, Hitler made Hess second in line to succeed him, after Hermann Göring. Around the same time, Hitler appointed Hess's chief of staff, Martin Bormann, as his personal secretary, a post formerly held by Hess.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{was born}} on January 25, 1897, in Pendleton, Texas, a small town near Waco, to {{sharecropper}} George Johnson (also identified as Willie Johnson Sr.) and his wife, Mary Fields, who died in 1901. His family, which according to the blues historian Steven Calt included at least one younger brother named Carl, moved to the agriculturally rich community of Marlin, where Johnson {{spent most of his}} childhood. There, the Johnson family attended church—most likely the Marlin Missionary Baptist Church—every Sunday, a practice which had a lasting impact on Johnson and fueled his <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ordained as a Baptist minister. When Johnson was five years old, his father gave him his first instrument—a cigar box guitar.|$|E
5|$|Melanie {{was created}} by {{producer}} Mara Brock Akil.

Mowry considered the character to be her first adult role and felt it emphasized her individuality and maturity. She identified closely with the part, observing parallels between Melanie's relationship with Derwin and her own marriage to actor Cory Hardrict. She cited The Game as an example of women receiving more lead roles on television.|$|E
