25|$|However, {{these public}} {{reactions}} {{have been criticized}} for embodying white feminism because they do not take into account <b>intersectionality</b> and the increased obstacles that women of color face. Intersectional feminists often find that white feminists attempt to speak for all women when relaying their experiences of the gender pay gap, when in reality their problems are not relatable to women of color who face an additional barrier of racism.|$|E
40|$|The call of this {{symposium}} was for articles regarding women 2 ̆ 7 s {{rights and}} the movement toward equality. We are still wrestling with what equality should mean. In this Article, when I refer to equality I envision it as both a strategy and as the end goal. Equality as a strategy means assessing the inherent inequalities of particular situations and using the means necessary to remedy the inequalities and achieve equality as the end goal. The end goal is for women (with all our complexities and <b>intersectionalities)</b> {{to achieve the same}} rights and results as men (with all their complexities and <b>intersectionalities)</b> and to be free from all forms of discrimination. Women continue to face injustices in the workplace that make it difficult to attain equality...|$|R

40|$|This article {{offers a}} {{reflexive}} account of {{conducting research on}} Polish migration to Scotland {{from the perspective of}} the "outsider. " The contribution argues for a revision to the insider/outsider dichotomy viewing it as inadequately nuanced in relation to the multiple <b>intersectionalities</b> performed through the research encounter. It is based on data collected from biographical-narrative interviews with Polish young people living in Edinburgh, Scotland. The article explores the interview encounter between an English researcher and Polish young people about the experience of EU mobility and argues that as migration narratives unfold the distinctions between the "researcher" and the "researched" blur. In particular, I focus on the intersections of gender, class and nationality to show how different positionalities are negotiated and confronted through reflexivity. The interview is a creative process involving co-construction of narratives through dialogue, embodied performances and non-cognitive associations that draw out the multiple <b>intersectionalities</b> of both parties. Through this process the binary of insider/outsider is called into question and this article examines the usefulness of this dichotomy as a framework for understanding the research relationship.

25|$|She {{used the}} work as a {{platform}} to offer a new, more inclusive feminist theory. Her theory encouraged the long-standing idea of sisterhood but advocated for women to acknowledge their differences while still accepting each other. Hooks challenged feminists to consider gender's relation to race, class, and sex, a concept known as <b>intersectionality.</b> She also argues {{for the importance of}} male involvement in the equality movement, stating that, in order for change to occur, men must do their part. Hooks also calls for a restructuring of the cultural framework of power, one that does not find oppression of others necessary.|$|E
25|$|From feminists' perspectives, sexology, {{which is}} the study of human {{sexuality}} and sexual relationship, relates to the <b>intersectionality</b> of gender, race and sexuality. Men have dominant power and control over women in the relationship, and women are expected to hide their true feeling about sexual behaviors. Women of color face even more sexual violence in the society. Some countries in Africa and Asia even practice female genital cutting, controlling women's sexual desire and limiting their sexual behavior. Moreover, Bunch, the women's and human rights activist, states that the society used to see lesbianism as a threat to male supremacy and to the political relationships between men and women. Therefore, in the past, people viewed being a lesbian as a sin and made it death penalty. Even today, many people still discriminate homosexuals. Many lesbians hide their sexuality and face even more sexual oppression.|$|E

An exploration of the <b>intersectionalities</b> between IPDV and mental distress {{within the context of}} negative social attitudes toward IPDV victims follows, highlighting the psychosocial significance of experiencing IPDV for the internalized social exclusion of victims of this type of violence. In this context it is further attempted to understand the seemingly contradictory behaviour of women experiencing IPDV in disclosing their experience and in living with, and leaving, the perpetrator. Prevalence statistics indicate the high rate of mental distress among IPDV women victims, as well as the types such distress takes. The relevance of these <b>intersectionalities</b> for mental health providers and workers in domestic violence services is further explored, including their distancing stance toward women experiencing both IPDV and mental distress. A case is put forward for applying the new meaning of recovery in mental health to women experiencing IPDV. That approach has the potential to provide a positive contribution, enabling them to move from being victims to becoming survivors, while taking into account several related intersectional connection...|$|R

I present these as glocal provocations that call for situating communities in history and political economy; appreciating the multiplicities, <b>intersectionalities</b> and tensions within communities, and designing work with deep participation by a range of community based colleagues to reflect a democratic commitment to the "right to research" by those most marginalized by social arrangements and even by the checkered history of community based research. ...|$|R

25|$|Youth {{exclusion}} is multi-dimensional in that age, race, gender, {{class and}} lifestyle all affect youth life experiences {{within a given}} culture. This <b>intersectionality</b> affects {{the degree to which}} an individual youth experiences exclusion. Similarly, youth exclusion is context specific. This means that youth are excluded from society in different ways depending on their cultural and spatial locations. A simple difference between the opportunities and resources provided in one neighborhood can create a divide among youth who are included and youth who are excluded from their communities. Another consideration is that youth exclusion is relational insofar as social exclusion contains two parties, the excluders and the excluded. Pertaining to youth exclusion, the excluders are often older generations who believe that the economic support services and institutions that help the youth puts their own comfortable standard of living at risk. All of these demographic, cultural, spatial and relational factors contribute to the worldwide experiences of youth exclusion.|$|E

The organization's website, for instance, states that Black Lives Matter is [...] "a unique contribution that goes beyond extrajudicial killings of Black people by police and vigilantes" [...] and, embracing <b>intersectionality,</b> that [...] "Black Lives Matter affirms the lives of Black queer and trans folks, disabled folks, black-undocumented folks, folks with records, women and all Black lives along the gender spectrum." [...] All three founders of the Black Lives Matter movement are women, and Garza and Cullors identify as queer. Additionally, Elle Hearns, one of the founding organizers of the global network, is a transgender woman. The founders believe that their backgrounds have paved the way for Black Lives Matter to be an intersectional movement. Several hashtags such as #BlackWomenMatter, #BlackGirlsMatter, #BlackQueerLivesMatter, and #BlackTransLivesMatter have surfaced on the BLM website and throughout social media networks. Marcia Chatelain, associate professor of history at Georgetown University, has praised BLM for allowing [...] "young, queer women [...] play a central role" [...] in the movement.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the major}} issues {{with the history of}} {{feminism}} is its inability to address the concept of <b>intersectionality.</b> Jill Matthews states “The new feminist history emerged almost 20 years ago as an arm of the Women's Liberation Movement, or second wave feminism, and it continues to serve that political process”.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Intersectionality</b> is the {{examination}} of various ways {{in which people are}} oppressed, based on the relational web of dominating factors of race, sex, class, nation and sexual orientation. <b>Intersectionality</b> [...] "describes the simultaneous, multiple, overlapping, and contradictory systems of power that shape our lives and political options". While this theory can be applied to all people, and more particularly all women, it is specifically mentioned and studied within the realms of black feminism. Patricia Hill Collins argues that black women in particular, have a unique perspective on the oppression of the world as unlike white women, they face both racial and gender oppression simultaneously, among other factors. This debate raises the issue of understanding the oppressive lives of women that are not only shaped by gender alone but by other elements such as racism, classism, ageism, heterosexism, ableism etc.|$|E

As noted in the article [...] "Experiencing Second-Wave Feminism In The USA", second-wave feminism [...] "ignored {{the fact that some}} women had benefited from slavery, colonialism, had waged wars, and were not necessarily or naturally oriented toward change that would support women from all class, ethnic, racial locations, and sexual orientations." ...|$|R

40|$|Drawing on {{research}} conducted with an anthropological approach in two transnational towns in Ceara State, {{in this paper}} I analyze the sexual and affective experiences of traveler women, mostly European. I explore the aspects involved in the intensely eroticized relationships which they establish with sexualized / racialized local men, perceived as embodying "Brazilian masculinity". Analyzing how <b>intersectionalities</b> permeate these relationships, my main argument is that the privileges associated with the women's economic, racial and national status, are disrupted when they turn into migrants. In the process of abandoning the tourist status, the fluidity of those sexual-economic exchanges disappears with particular cruelty for the older women, to whom the reconfiguration of local gender codes unbalances their previous privileges...|$|R
2500|$|Womanist theory, while diverse, holds at {{its core}} that that both {{femininity}} and culture are equally {{as important to the}} woman’s existence. In this conception one’s femininity cannot be stripped from the culture that it exists within. At first glance, this seems similar to the thought process of third wave feminism, which embraced the concept of <b>intersectionality.</b> The difference lies in the valuation placed on <b>intersectionality</b> within the theoretical frameworks. Womanism espouses the idea that the culture of the woman, which in this case is the focal point of intersection as opposed to class or some other characteristic, is not an element of her femininity, but rather is the lens through which femininity exists. As such, a woman’s Blackness is not a component of her feminism; instead, her Blackness is the lens through which she understands her femininity.|$|E

40|$|This paper brings labour {{back into}} the {{literature}} on legal empowerment against poverty. Employing a historical lens, I outline three waves of legal movements. Each wave is distinguished by its timing, the state-level target, and the actors involved. In all three waves, legal empowerment was won, not bestowed. Labour played a significant role, fighting in each subsequent wave for an expanded identity to address exclusions. These findings reveal the false dichotomy used to distinguish workers from citizens and class from identity-based interests. They underline the significance of symbolic power of legal recognition, {{even in the absence}} of perfect implementation. Finally, they highlight contemporary workers as an overlooked, identity-based group that addresses the <b>intersectionalities</b> between class and ascriptive characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Within the {{emergence}} of migrant activism, the experience of UndocuQueers developed in San Francisco from 2011 challenges common assumption about practices in migrant movements through the intersections between queer and migrant claims.

I will finally argue that UndocuQueer movement and its cultural production offer a ground-breaking example of political practices of rights and propose a promising perspective for a critical engagement with citizenship issues...|$|R
