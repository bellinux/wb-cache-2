[...] "Yes, I did. Other people found that preposterous. I suppose there's a moral issue there. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have been a very interesting thing though. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have been very interesting had she gone off, because I suspected that there was that romance, attachment there, that obsession with her.

[...] Nevertheless, Voss flew a morning mission and shot down an Airco DH.4 from 57 Squadron at 09:30 hours. Upon his return to his air base with bullet holes in his Fokker, he took advantage of Richthofen's absence at the Voss family hunting lodge to celebrate with a victory loop before landing. In contrast to Voss's usual tidy flying garb, he was wearing striped gray trousers, a dirty gray sweater, and tall lace-up boots.|$|E
500|$|Hendrickson told TVSource {{magazine}} {{that she was}} [...] "petrified" [...] of filming the heavily emotional storyline. She stated, [...] "I was just really intimidated because I don’t have a child. I’ve never experienced that unconditional love with someone – for someone [...] I really didn’t have that much to connect to in my own personal life. I think that’s what scared me the most – how I {{was going to find}} it within myself to tell a truthful story." [...] Having previously noted that becoming a mother [...] "matured" [...] Chloe, Hendrickson said, [...] "I would love to see {{a little bit of the}} old Chloe come out of this extreme loss that she’s just experienced. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> make a lot of sense." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{graduating from}} Princeton in 1971, Berg decided {{to expand the}} thesis into a {{full-length}} biography, thinking it would take around nine months. He also formulated a career plan at this time, and later recalled: [...] "I did tell myself early on: <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be interesting, perhaps, to spend a career writing a half-dozen biographies of twentieth-century American cultural figures—each one, as I often use as my metaphor, a different wedge of the great apple pie." [...] The Perkins biography, Max Perkins: Editor of Genius, took longer than Berg anticipated and was eventually published in 1978, winning a National Book Award in Biography. In 2016, The New Yorker credited Berg with [...] "almost single-handedly rescu Maxwell Perkins from the anonymity he desired." ...|$|E

[...] In September, The September Issue, a documentary film by The War Room producer R.J. Cutler about the production of the September 2007 issue, was released. It focused on the sometimes-difficult relationship between Wintour and creative director Grace Coddington. She appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman to promote it, defending the relevance of fashion in a tough economy.

500|$|Leigh's death {{received}} {{widespread and}} ongoing coverage {{in both the}} Sydney and Newcastle media, possibly due to a fascination with her reduplicated name. Between 1989 and 1994, The Newcastle Herald ran at least 39 stories on Leigh, 23 of them featured on the front page. At least ten articles on the case were published in The Sydney Morning Herald during the same period. Both the extended media coverage and the theatrical plays and film the murder inspired have led to it being termed a [...] "celebrity crime", and to Leigh being {{referred to as a}} [...] "celebrity victim". In 1996 Psychologist Roger Peters attributed the media fascination to the sense of community in Stockton, and due to the crimes being committed by people not considered to be typical criminals, [...] stating [...] "I think one of the main things is that people can identify with people involved.

He felt {{that after the}} [...] "brilliant" [...] episode from the previous week, [...] "The Coup" [...] was [...] "somewhat anticlimactic, as Jim doesn't interact at all with the Scranton branch and the Pam-Jim storyline is pretty much ignored." [...] Despite his disappointment with Jim's storyline, Zoromski commented that the [...] "best moments of the episode were the completely random ones, such as Dwight knowing that Jan wears blouses from Liz Claiborne and earrings from Ann Taylor." [...] AOLTV's Michael Sciannamea was also unhappy with Jim's scenes, writing that they were [...] "beginning to grate on [...] Is every branch office at Dunder Mifflin filled with crazies? How then does the company stay in business? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have been funnier if Jim ended up in an office where it's nothing but work and no play at all.

Even if it was a cavalry movie doing a historically dishonorable thing to the Indians, even as there was a feeling of {{what it meant to be}} a man, what it meant to have some sense of duty.... Now today we have the same actor making his new war movie in a war so hopelessly corrupt that, without seeing the movie, I'm sure it is perfectly safe to say that it will be an almost robot-view of soldiery, just by definition of how the whole country has deteriorated. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> make a very interesting double feature to show a good old Wayne movie like, say, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon with The Green Berets.

500|$|Prior {{to being}} cast as Kyla, Rakie Ayola had made former {{appearances}} in both Holby City and its sister show Casualty - {{in the former}} as a patient, in series five, episode 32 [...] "By Any Other Name", and the latter as a patient's relative, in series 13, episode 19, [...] "Trapped". She was approached about returning to Holby City in a more permanent role by BBC casting director Julie Harkin, who was also responsible for casting fellow Holby City newcomers Luke Roberts as Joseph Byrne and Tom Chambers as Sam Strachan. After {{a series of three}} meetings, two years after the birth of her first child, she agreed readily, despite being [...] "nervous about signing such a long contract", and having claimed just sixteen months previously that she had no desire to work in any long running serial - lambasting the quality of long-term recurring characters by stating: [...] "I watch lots of soaps and love watching them but I often think how frustrating it must be when they make a character into such an idiot. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> drive me mad to pick up a script and think, 'Who am I kissing now?'" ...|$|E
500|$|Due to the {{impending}} Writers Guild of America strike, writer and co-executive producer Maurice Hurley developed the teleplay {{in a day}} and a half from fan fiction written by Deborah McIntyre and Mona Clee. Due to the strike, certain story ideas were removed from the plot including the planned first appearance of the Borg which was subsequently delayed until the [...] episode [...] "Q Who". This was because [...] "The Neutral Zone" [...] was originally intended to be the first of a two-part episode, but due to the strike there wasn't enough time to write the second part and so the story was shortened. The second episode would have seen the Enterprise and the Romulans team up against the Borg. The script that was shot was a first draft, and due to the writer's strike in place, no amendments were subsequently made. Director James L. Conway later explained, [...] "If there hadn't been a strike, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have been a better script." [...] It was the second episode of The Next Generation directed by Conway, the first being [...] "" [...] earlier in the first season.

500|$|Bono {{agreed to}} Carter's request without asking {{the rest of}} the band, and when {{informed}} of the idea, the other members gave only tacit approval. They briefly considered playing an impromptu concert in the city, with Bono suggesting that they perform in the bunker where Carter and his friends hid during the siege. He said, [...] "even if all we get is some extra attention for Bosnia on MTV, that's something". The idea fell through when it was pointed out that the logistics of transporting their equipment into the city were impossible, as the only way into Sarajevo was on a United Nations plane. Manager Paul McGuinness realized that even if the band managed to organize a concert, it would endanger their lives and those of the audience and the Zoo TV crew. As he explained, [...] "U2's effort to discuss any humanitarian issue have sometimes been accompanied by a false instinct that U2 is also obliged to resolve that issue. Going to Sarajevo seems to me to fall into that category. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> endanger the people we go with, endanger the tour, and endanger the band."
