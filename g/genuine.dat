5|$|On air, it was {{promoted}} {{as a series}} of <b>genuine</b> infomercials.|$|E
5|$|The Vangelo {{manuscript}} {{represents a}} <b>genuine</b> text from an otherwise undiscovered religion.|$|E
5|$|Advertised as {{a series}} of <b>genuine</b> infomercials, both seasons were {{broadcast}} at 4a.m., as part of the network's DVR Theater block.|$|E
5|$|Belief in pig-faced women declined, and {{the last}} {{significant}} work to treat their existence as <b>genuine</b> was published in 1924. Today, the legend is almost forgotten.|$|E
5|$|Deanesly and Grosjean's thesis was {{addressed}} and refuted by the textual research of Paul Meyvaert, following whose work most scholars {{have come to}} accept the Libellus as a <b>genuine</b> letter of Gregory. The only portion of the Libellus that Meyvaert could not accept as <b>genuine</b> was the chapter on marriage, which Meyvaert (like Boniface before him) believed {{could not have been}} written by Gregory. Meyvaert therefore pronounced this chapter to be the single interpolation in an otherwise <b>genuine</b> document. All subsequent scholarship up until the year 2008 has followed him on this point. In 2008 Ubl not only showed that the marriage chapter was in fact authored by Gregory, but he also explained exactly how it was the Boniface and later historians came to misunderstand its meaning.|$|E
5|$|Like all Harvard's {{valuable}} books, {{works in}} the Widener Collection may be consulted by researchers demonstrating a <b>genuine</b> research need.|$|E
5|$|Most {{academic}} sources {{maintain that}} the associations made between world events and Nostradamus's quatrains are largely the result of misinterpretations or mistranslations (sometimes deliberate) or else are so vague as to render them useless as evidence of any <b>genuine</b> predictive power.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand Oslac is also a <b>genuine</b> English name, and the common Os element Oslac's name shared {{with the name of}} Osulf of Bamburgh, {{previous}} ealdorman of York, points to a connection with the Bamburgh family of the English far north.|$|E
5|$|Other than Mugdrum in the Firth of Tay and the Islands of the Forth {{there are}} no <b>genuine</b> islands {{on the east coast}} of Scotland south of Buddon Ness.|$|E
5|$|Successfully {{mimicking}} a <b>genuine</b> scientific work, Rhinogradentia {{has appeared}} in several publications without any note of its fictitious nature, sometimes in connection with April Fools' Day.|$|E
5|$|The LCS also lacked {{knowledge}} of MI5's Double-Cross System and its double agents. The department were unaware that no uncontrolled German operatives {{were active in}} the UK, and so incorrectly believed any deception {{would have to be}} highly realistic to appear <b>genuine.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Library {{is open to}} {{everyone}} who has a <b>genuine</b> need to use its collections. Anyone with a permanent address who wishes {{to carry out research}} can apply for a Reader Pass; they are required to provide proof of signature and address.|$|E
5|$|The Naked Brothers Band is a 2005 American children's film {{written and}} {{directed}} by Polly Draper, which stars her sons, Nat Wolff and Alex Wolff, who portray members of a fictional rock group. It tells of the boys' struggles with their fame and an internal dispute that causes the band to split before reuniting in the end. The musical comedy was emboldened by Nat's <b>genuine</b> band, The Silver Boulders, which he created in preschool with his friends who all portray themselves. The movie also includes the band's manager, Nat's faux female interest, the siblings' real life cousin as the group's babysitter, and the siblings' <b>genuine</b> father playing their inept accordion-playing dad.|$|E
5|$|The {{approximate}} {{ratios of}} periods of adjacent orbits are (proceeding outward): 1:20, 1:3, 1:6, 1:20. The nearly 1:3 ratio between 55 Cancri b and c is apparently a near resonance, {{rather than a}} <b>genuine</b> mean motion resonance.|$|E
5|$|The coin {{has been}} counterfeited {{from time to}} time. Various {{techniques}} have also been used to make <b>genuine</b> specimens shinier to deceive collectors, including polishing, a process that damages their surfaces and patina.|$|E
5|$|The {{doctrine}} of standing prevents applicants from burdening {{the court with}} frivolous or vexatious claims. This minimizes disruption in the administrative process. When an administrative decision by a public authority is challenged, implementation of {{the decision by the}} authority may be delayed. Therefore, the courts want to restrict access to applicants who have a <b>genuine</b> interest in challenging the decision. Furthermore, since the courts' resources are limited, restricting access to <b>genuine</b> claims ensures that judicial resources are appropriately allocated.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a landing}} place {{used by the}} tourist boats just north of Am Buachaille, but {{disembarkation}} is only possible in calm conditions. The island lacks a <b>genuine</b> anchorage.|$|E
5|$|Trump {{also claimed}} {{to own the}} {{painting}} Two Sisters (On the Terrace), an 1881 work by French Impressionist artist Pierre-Auguste Renoir. The original work hangs in the Art Institute of Chicago. In October 2017, Timothy L. O'Brien said that during his interviews with Trump for the book , he asked Trump about the copy of Two Sisters, which was then located on Trump's plane. Trump repeatedly said that his copy was the <b>genuine</b> work, despite O'Brien's statements to the contrary. By then, the Renoir copy was hanging in Trump's penthouse office, and the Art Institute of Chicago released a statement refuting Trump's claim that his Renoir copy was the <b>genuine</b> one.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} decrees that were {{probably}} fraudulent were submitted and duly printed in local newspapers, {{and it is}} believed that in at least a few cases, newspaper editors themselves drafted fictitious edicts to suit their own agendas. The San Francisco Museum and Historical Society maintains a list of the decrees believed to be <b>genuine.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the BJP {{victory of}} 2014, Tharoor {{was asked to}} help the {{treasury}} benches draft a statement condemning Pakistan for freeing Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, the Lashkar-e-Toiba commander, who masterminded the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed 166 people. In January 2015, Tharoor asked not to debunk <b>genuine</b> accomplishments of Ancient Indian Science due to exaggerations of the Hindutva brigade, amid 2015 Indian Science Congress ancient aircraft controversy.|$|E
5|$|Albert Calmette and Camille Guérin {{achieved}} the first <b>genuine</b> success in immunization against tuberculosis in 1906, using attenuated bovine-strain tuberculosis. It was called bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG). The BCG vaccine {{was first used}} on humans in 1921 in France, but received widespread acceptance in the US, Great Britain, and Germany only after World War II.|$|E
5|$|Asser is {{sometimes}} {{cited as a}} source for the legend about Alfred's having founded the University of Oxford, which is now known to be false. A short passage making this claim was interpolated by William Camden into his 1603 edition of Asser's Life. Doubts have also been raised periodically about whether the entire Life is a forgery, written by a slightly later writer, but it is now almost universally accepted as <b>genuine.</b>|$|E
5|$|Between 1870 and 1873, chemist and {{physicist}} William Crookes conducted {{experiments to}} determine {{the validity of the}} phenomena produced by three mediums: Florence Cook, Kate Fox, and Home. Crookes' final report in 1874 concluded that the phenomena produced by all three mediums were <b>genuine,</b> a result which was roundly derided by the scientific establishment. Crookes recorded that he controlled and secured Home by placing his feet on the top of Home's feet. Crooke's method of foot control later proved inadequate when used with Eusapia Palladino, as she merely slipped her foot out and into her sturdy shoe. In addition, Crookes' motives, methods, and conclusions with regard to Florence Cook were called into question, both at the time and subsequently, casting doubt on his conclusions about Home. In a series of experiments in London at the house of Crookes in February 1875, the medium Anna Eva Fay managed to fool Crookes into believing she had <b>genuine</b> psychic powers. Fay later confessed to her fraud and revealed the tricks she had used.|$|E
5|$|Bulgarians {{and ethnic}} Macedonians seek {{to deny the}} {{self-identification}} of the Slavic speaking minority in northern Greece, which mostly self-identifies as Greek. Extremists on all sides {{have been known to}} fabricate and reproduce falsified information, along with denying <b>genuine</b> information and propagating unscientific and pseudoscientific theories.|$|E
5|$|Companies closely {{associated}} with camouflage patterns include 6876, A Bathing Ape, Stone Island, Stüssy, Maharishi, mhi, Zoo York, Addict, and Girbaud, using and overprinting <b>genuine</b> military surplus fabric; others use camouflage patterns in bright colours such as pink or purple. Some, such as Emma Lundgren and Stüssy, have created their own designs or integrated camouflage patterns with other symbols.|$|E
5|$|Cotillo's early law {{practice}} included {{a lot of}} uncompensated charity for the neighborhood. Apart from a <b>genuine</b> social compassion, Cotillo was also building political alliances {{that would make it}} possible for him to use the Italian-American voter power as his Irish-American forerunners in New York were using the power of other immigrant groups.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of <b>genuine</b> opposition, the liberalized {{election}} format allowed for various power struggles to be played out, primarily between the communist party candidates. A particularly notable case was the rivalry between certain candidates from the main communist party (PZPR) {{and one of the}} lesser communist parties (ZSL).|$|E
5|$|Extensive {{work was}} put into {{creating}} a <b>genuine</b> and historically correct atmosphere for the film. The facades of the houses of Mirabeau had to be replaced with painted polystyrene, {{to make them look}} older, and all electric wires were put underground. Meanwhile, in Vaugines, Berri planted a dozen olive trees twelve months before filming started, and watered them throughout the waiting period, and for the second installment planted 10,000 carnations on the farm.|$|E
5|$|Falsified records {{identified}} by Rasmussen and Prys-Jones included high-altitude occurrences of coral-billed scimitar-babbler Pomatorhinus ferruginosus, out-of-range Kashmir flycatcher Ficedula subrubra and Himalayan winter records of ferruginous flycatcher Muscicapa ferruginea and large blue flycatcher Cyornis magnirostris (now hill blue-flycatcher C. banyumas). However, some records {{such as those}} for Afghan snowfinch Montifringilla theresae, a species Meinertzhagen described, appear to be <b>genuine.</b>|$|E
5|$|For Greece {{is already}} entirely obedient to you, {{and will remain}} so: the Achaeans from <b>genuine</b> affection; the Aetolians from the terror which their {{disasters}} in the present war have inspired them. Italy, and your crossing into it, {{is the first step}} in the acquirement of universal empire, to which no one has a better claim than yourself. And now is the moment to act when the Romans have suffered a reverse.|$|E
5|$|<b>Genuine</b> press cards can be {{obtained}} by people not entitled to them, counterfeit copies of real cards can be made, and plausible-looking cards can be issued by anybody, or made. The reasons and consequences range from the trivial (free drinks) to the catastrophic (access by terrorists to rulers).|$|E
5|$|Historical {{accuracy}} {{was important}} to many British designers, resulting {{in the use of}} <b>genuine</b> military equipment as models for memorials, and long discussions with committees over the details to be incorporated into designs. In contrast, the British interest in accurately depicting real weaponry from the war was far less common on German monuments, where usually stylised medieval weapons and armour were used.|$|E
5|$|Hogarth {{revisited}} Morning in his bidding ticket, Battle of the Pictures, for {{the auction}} of his works, held in 1745. In this, his own paintings are pictured {{being attacked by}} ranks of Old Masters; Morning is stabbed by a work featuring St. Francis as Hogarth contrasts the false piety of the prudish spinster with the <b>genuine</b> piety of the Catholic saint.|$|E
5|$|Howard {{shows up}} at Bernadette's {{apartment}} and gives Penny a heartfelt and <b>genuine</b> apology to give to her, which reduces Penny to tears. Bernadette overhears this and forgives him. Amy is relieved that she is still a maid of honor and the four hug. Leonard later meets Penny {{in the laundry room}} and wants to have sex, but Penny declines.|$|E
5|$|In 1506 Leonardo {{returned}} to Milan. Many {{of his most}} prominent pupils or followers in painting either knew or worked with him in Milan, including Bernardino Luini, Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio and Marco d'Oggiono. At this time he may have commenced a project for an equestrian figure of Charles II d'Amboise, the acting French governor of Milan. A wax model survives and, if <b>genuine,</b> is the only extant example of Leonardo's sculpture.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, another {{investigation}} was {{undertaken by the}} States forensic labs of the Netherlands using up-to-date techniques, including gas chromatography, to formally confirm the origin of six van Meegeren forgeries that had been alleged to be <b>genuine</b> Vermeers, including the Emmaus and the Last Supper. The conclusions of the 1946 commission were again reaffirmed and upheld by the Dutch judicial system.|$|E
