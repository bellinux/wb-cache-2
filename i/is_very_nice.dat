500|$|Algis Budrys {{concluded}} {{his review}} of The Watch Below with [...] "...this <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>nice</b> writing when considered simply as prose and {{as an attempt to}} involve the reader's emotions." [...] However, when reviewing All Judgment Fled he wrote, [...] "I suspect that he generates so much tension within himself while writing a book that he literally cannot bear {{to come to grips with}} crucial scenes." ...|$|E

Young, who was the first ambassador to live in the suite with [...] "young children", stated that [...] "he Waldorf <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>nice,</b> and its convenient, but I just have problems trying to bring up a small child in a hotel." [...] However, the search ultimately [...] "became a media issue" [...] and Young elected to stay in the suite. Nevertheless, he opined that [...] "eople tried to make it seem like I was saying that the Waldorf wasn't good enough for us".|$|E
500|$|Film critics {{appreciated}} {{the first season}} of Avatar: The Last Airbender because it {{attracted the attention of}} [...] "an audience beyond the children's market with crisp animation and layered storytelling."

[...] He says later in the review that [...] "the audio <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>nice,</b> with lots of directional effects and nice musical cues."

"Very true," [...] said Henry, [...] "and this <b>is</b> a <b>very</b> <b>nice</b> day, and we <b>are</b> {{taking a}} <b>very</b> <b>nice</b> walk, and you <b>are</b> two <b>very</b> <b>nice</b> young ladies. Oh! It <b>is</b> a <b>very</b> <b>nice</b> word indeed! It does for everything. Originally {{perhaps it was}} applied only to express neatness, propriety, delicacy, or refinement--people were nice in their dress, in their sentiments, or their choice. But now every {{commendation}} on every subject is comprised in that one word." ...|$|R
500|$|Spain's first match during {{qualification}} for the 2010 World Cup {{was against}} Bosnia and Herzegovina where Villa scored the only {{goal of the}} game. He {{would go on to}} score four goals in Spain's next three games, including a last minute winner against Belgium. Another goal during a friendly match against Chile saw him end the year with 12 goals, breaking Raúl's record of 10 goals held since 1999. Villa began 2009 with a goal against England in a 2–0 friendly, with this goal, he broke another record and became the first Spanish international to have scored in six consecutive games, seeing off records set by Telmo Zarra and László Kubala. Speaking of the goal, he said, [...] "I am very happy with the goal. Truth is, I really want to see it on TV. The record <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>nice.</b> I would never have imagined in years that I would be able to obtain it. I am very proud and I hope I can continue breaking records." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following Kenny's departure, {{the door}} {{has been left}} open for her return. Kenny commented: [...] "All I can say is it's a very Zsa Zsa ending and it suits the character. The door is open, which <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>nice</b> - I'd {{absolutely}} consider going back. It was really emotional. It's just like leaving behind a massive family. I really miss it - but onwards and upwards". Kenny also discussed writing the second series of EastEnders: E20, saying: [...] "I really wanted it {{to start with a}} bang. As soon as you come in it's exciting, there's sex and romance and kissing. I wanted it to be really fresh".|$|E
2500|$|D. H. Lawrence took an opposing, pessimistic view of Revelation in {{the final}} book he wrote, Apocalypse. He saw the {{language}} which Revelation used as being bleak and destructive; a 'death-product'. Instead, he wanted to champion a public-spirited individualism (which he identified with the historical Jesus supplemented by an ill-defined cosmic consciousness) against its two natural enemies. One of these he called [...] "the sovereignty of the intellect" [...] which he saw in a technology-based totalitarian society. The other enemy he styled [...] "vulgarity" [...] {{and that was what}} he found in Revelation. [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>nice</b> if you are poor and not humble ... to bring your enemies down to utter destruction, while you yourself rise up to grandeur. And nowhere does this happen so splendiferously than in Revelation." ...|$|E

2500|$|Compute! {{presented}} opposing {{views of}} the game in May 1988. The magazine included Balance of Power in its list of [...] "Our Favorite Games", calling it [...] "an impressive recreation of the world's geopolitical landscape ... call one too many bluffs and you'll see the chilling message You have ignited a nuclear war". Orson Scott Card, however, wrote in his review of the game that Crawford—"the best designer of simulation games I've seen"—was [...] "leaning over your shoulder and bullying you into playing the game his way. He has a sweet delusion {{that as long as the}} United States <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>nice</b> and doesn't do anything to offend them, the Russians will go home. And if you don't play that way, why, he'll stop the game with a nasty remark about how the world was just destroyed by nuclear war". He added that since no nuclear war had been fought Crawford could not know what would cause one, and [...] "there are a lot of experts who claim that the Soviets seem to behave a lot nicer when we stand up to them than when we disarm", but that [...] " [...] is so sure he's right that Balance of Power isn't a game, it's propaganda".|$|E
2500|$|The {{previous}} year a perfume created for Hobson had been marketed as [...] "Great Expectations" [...] {{to coincide with}} her role as Estella Havisham in David Lean's film of that name, based on Charles Dickens' 1861 novel. In England, this attracted the custom of [...] then-Oxford University undergraduate Margaret Roberts, later British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who, a little daringly for the time, also shopped for [...] "push-up" [...] pink brassieres. In 1953, when Hobson starred in the musical The King and I in London, {{it was apparent that}} she had retained a Parisienne mix of chic and Boheminism. A Daily Mirror journalist described her [...] "pale, ladylike looks, her well-bred clothes ... she likes embroidery and painting", while a young Etonian who visited her dressing room recalled that [...] "it had been freshly painted pink and white for her, and was like entering a risqué French apartment". Ten years later, when Hobson's husband, the politician John Profumo, was involved in a sex scandal that threatened to destabilise the British government, Prime Minister Harold Macmillan wrote that [...] "his [...] wife <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>nice</b> and sensible. Of course, these people live in a raffish, theatrical, bohemian society where no one really knows anyone and everyone is [...] "darling"".|$|E
