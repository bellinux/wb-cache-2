5000|$|On April 17, 1961, 1,400 U.S.-trained Cuban exiles invaded Cuba {{during the}} Bay of Pigs Invasion.

However, historians give him a share of credit for the victory as he was director of instruction for Cuba's armed forces at the time. Author Tad Szulc in his explanation of the Cuban victory, assigns Guevara partial credit, stating: [...] "The revolutionaries won because Che Guevara, as the head of the Instruction Department of the Revolutionary Armed Forces <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> the <b>militia</b> training program, had done so well in preparing 200,000 men and women for war."

Wooster was first given command as a major general <b>of</b> Connecticut <b>militia</b> companies sent to defend New York City against possible British troop landings. When the Continental Army was established, Wooster was commissioned a brigadier general, and his troops were sent to be part of General Philip Schuyler and General Richard Montgomery's 1775 invasion of Quebec. Wooster participated in the Siege of Fort St. Jean in the fall of 1775, and was then given military command of Montreal after that city fell in November.

5000|$|The Militia Ordinance was a {{piece of}} {{legislation}} passed by the Long Parliament of England in March 1642, which was a major step towards the Civil War between the King and Parliament of England. Previously the King had the sole right to appoint the Lord Lieutenants, who were <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> the county <b>militias</b> (also known as the trained bands). These militias were the only land forces available in peacetime, because England had no regular standing army. As relations between King and Parliament deteriorated, control <b>of</b> the <b>militia</b> became a very controversial issue. Parliament did not trust Charles and tried to deny him control of any military forces which he might use against them. Charles I attempted to arrest five members of the Commons and one Lord in January 1642, but the episode resulted in the five members being hailed heroes and Charles' departure from London. On 5 March 1642 the anti-royalist majority in the House of Lords passed an Ordinance appointing their choice of Lieutenants, although a royalist minority protested (House of Lords Journal, 5 March 1642). The House of Commons agreed to the Ordinance the same day (House of Commons Journal, 5 March 1642), but according to English custom no legislation could become law until it received the royal assent. The King refused to give his assent to the bill, but on 15 March 1642 Parliament declared that [...] "the People are bound by the Ordinance for the Militia, though it has not received the Royal Assent" [...] (House of Lords Journal, 15 March 1642). This {{was the first time that}} Parliament had ever put a law into effect without royal assent. Such an unprecedented assertion of Parliamentary sovereignty made war far more likely.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of Hamilton P. Bee and {{his role in the}} American Civil War. Bee was first a Texas brigadier general, <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> a state <b>militia</b> district, and then a Confederate brigadier general, in command of the Western Sub-District of Texas. His duties {{included}} administration, diplomacy, and combat. As commander of the area from San Antonio to the Rio Grande, Bee had to cope with Unionist sentiment, regulation of trade â especially the control and impressment of cotton [...] border unrest, relations with Mexico and France, and Federal invasion of the Rio Grande border and occupation of the coast. He also took part in the Confederate action against Nathaniel Banks's Red River Campaign into Louisiana in 1864 and participated in the battles of Mansfield, Pleasant Hill, and Monett's Ferry. Bee proved to be a competent administrator and an excellent diplomat, but no combat general. He ran his sub-district and the cotton trade about as well as anyone could have, and through his arrangements with the cotton owners {{was the only one who}} arrived at a viable method whereby the government obtained the needed cotton. His extradition agreement with the Mexicans and his dealings with them kept the peace on the border. But he had no experience in combat, and, when the Union forces invaded Texas at Brownsville, he panicked and ran. His actions in the battles in Louisiana showed him to be courageous and level-headed in the heat of battle, but were still indicative of his inexperience. After Richard Taylor accused him of letting Banks escape and relieved him of duty, Bee could do little to regain public confidence even though he was not at fault. He spent the remainder of the conflict in Texas and at war's end fled to Mexico to escape Unionist wrath. Since Bee was involved in all the major issues of the Trans-Mississippi, a study of his career offers a key to understanding the problems and difficulties in Texas and the failure of the area to live up to its potential to aid the Confederate war effort...|$|R
