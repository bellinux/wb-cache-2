25|$|Vaidyanathan <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> {{idea when}} {{he watched a}} {{political}} debate in a television channel in the United States.

Principal photography commenced during mid-April 2014 in Kollam, Kerala.

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by John Swartzwelder, who <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> from {{another member of the}} writing staff, Mike Scully. When the show runners of this season, Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, took over the job from David Mirkin, they wanted to [...] "take the show back" [...] to the Simpson family. Their goal was to have at least 15 episodes per season that {{revolved}} around the family or a member of the family, but they still wanted to do the annual Halloween episode, a Sideshow Bob episode, an Itchy and Scratchy episode, and a [...] "format bending" [...] episode, which in this season was [...] "22 Short Films About Springfield". They wanted the family episodes to be realistic, and Oakley thought [...] "Homer the Smithers" [...] was a good example. When Scully pitched the idea to the writers, Oakley was surprised that it had not been done earlier on the show. He thought the story sounded like something that would have been done by the third season because it was [...] "simple" [...] and [...] "organic".|$|E

After a heated confrontation that dragged {{for a couple of}} months, with threats of taking Survival International to court for libel, The Observer ended up conceding in August 2008 that it had <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> wrong. In a clarification, the newspaper stated: [...] "While The Observer cannot be responsible for content of other media it does have a duty under the Editors' Code not to publish 'inaccurate, misleading or distorted information'. It failed in that duty here." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Alexandra Fenwick of the Columbia Journalism Review on September 18, 2009, journalist Mark Bowden of The Atlantic said about the case:The young woman and filmmaker who visited those ACORN offices were political activists, and they put together what is, in essence, a very effective political protest against an organization {{they would like to}} damage. And they've done a very effective job of doing that. But I think they're clearly not journalists.The next spring, on March 20, 2010, Clark Hoyt, public editor of The New York Times, wrote an op-ed column conceding some errors in the paper's reporting. ACORN and its supporters had complained [...] "that The Times <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> wrong and, by failing to correct it, has played into the hands of a campaign that has pushed the group near extinction." [...] Hoyt acknowledged that it was by then known that it was not likely that O'Keefe went into the ACORN offices dressed as a pimp, as {{at the beginning and end}} of most of the videos. O'Keefe had presented himself [...] "as a clean-cut young man, sometimes a college student, trying to rescue his girlfriend and under-age girls from an abusive pimp." [...] But, Hoyt wrote:ACORN's supporters appear to hope that the whole story will fall apart over the issue of what O'Keefe wore: if that was wrong, everything else must be wrong. The record does not support them. If O'Keefe did not dress as a pimp, he clearly presented himself as one: a fellow trying to set up a woman — sometimes along with under-age girls — in a house where they would work as prostitutes.His article appeared before the release on April 1, 2010, of the California AG Report, which found that O'Keefe's videos had all been heavily edited to misrepresent the ACORN workers and present them in the worst possible light. The pair had set up the workers rather than doing investigative journalism. Investigations by the California AG, Brooklyn U.S. Attorney and the U.S. GAO found that ACORN workers had not participated in criminal activities.|$|E
