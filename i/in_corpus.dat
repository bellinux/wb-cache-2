At {{the height of the}} storm, an estimated 64,000people were without power in south Texas. Portions of Texas State Highway Loop 281 were submerged in floodwaters, leaving $50,000 (1999USD) in damage. Damage <b>in</b> <b>Corpus</b> Christi were estimated at $100,000 (1999USD). In Duval County, 200 homes were damaged by flooding and large areas of agricultural land were flooded. Damage in the county amounted to roughly $2million (1999USD). Five other F0 tornadoes touched down in the state. Damage to homes and businesses <b>in</b> <b>Corpus</b> Christi was estimated up to $500,000 (1999USD); agricultural damage reached $1million and another $500,000 (1999USD) was reported in losses.

Analyses made at different phases of the reproductive cycle are in accord with this relationship. It is suggested that ascorbate, which is a well-established donor in peroxidase reactions, undergoes rapid oxidation in the presence of this enzyme, producing an intermediate free radical which, if coupled with pregnenolone, might produce progesterone <b>in</b> the <b>corpora</b> lutea.

5|$|Hunting {{dolphins}} (at {{the time}} still often incorrectly {{referred to as}} fish or porpoises), primarily using harpoons and firearms, was considered a form of recreational hunting along {{the shores of the}} Gulf of Mexico in Texas in the late 19th and early 20th century.

The data indicate appreciable 20 a-OH SDH activity <b>in</b> <b>corpora</b> of pseudopregnancy, <b>in</b> involut-ing <b>corpora</b> formed <b>in</b> estrous cycles prior to pseudopregnancy, and in the interstitial tissue of the ovary of the pseudopregnant rat. Although enzymatic activity remained unchanged in the latter two compartments between Days 6 and 15 of pseudopregnancy, a twofold elevation <b>in</b> <b>corpora</b> of pseudopregnancy 20 a-OH SDH activity was evidenced between Days 11 and 15.

5|$|Tropical Storm Amelia was a weak, poorly {{organized}} {{tropical storm}} that formed during the 1978 Atlantic hurricane season.

However, the tropical depression defied predictions, quickly strengthening into a weak tropical storm just hours before making landfall <b>in</b> <b>Corpus</b> Christi. The storm lasted roughly a day over land before becoming unidentifiable after being active for just under 48hours. After dissipating, the storm caused a severe flooding disaster in Texas.|$|E

5|$|Amelia {{affected}} the Texas coast {{for two days}} which caused several shipping incidents and minor damage <b>in</b> <b>Corpus</b> Christi and South Padre Island. While active, there were no deaths linked to the storm. However, the biggest impact from the storm followed its dissipation, when its remnants contributed to record rainfall totals over the state. The state, already suffering from a previous drought, believed that the rain would help alleviate the conditions. However, the dry ground aided the flooding from the storm. The rainfall caused several rivers and creeks to flood, especially around the Texas Hill Country and northern Texas, leading to severe damage. Following the storm, President Jimmy Carter declared six counties in the state as federal disaster areas, allowing residents to seek aid from the government. Additional aid was brought in {{from as far away}} as New York. Overall, Amelia caused 33fatalities with an estimated $110million in damages in what then-governor Dolph Briscoe called one of the worst floods in the history of the state.|$|E

Later that day, Texas State Highway 361 and docks in Port Aransas were shut down.

Immunodetectable MCP- 1 was evident <b>in</b> <b>corpora</b> lutea of cows at Days 6, 12, and 18 postovulation (Day 0 = ovulation, n = 4 cows/stage). Day 6 corpora lutea contained minimal MCP- 1 that was confined primarily to blood vessels. In contrast, relatively intense staining for MCP- 1 was observed <b>in</b> <b>corpora</b> lutea from Days 12 and 18 postovulation. MCP- 1 was again most evident in {{the cells of the}} vasculature, but it was also observed surrounding individual luteal cells, particularly by Day 18. An increase in immunohistochemical expression of MCP- 1 on Days 12 and 18 postovulation corresponded with increases in MCP- 1 mRNA and protein <b>in</b> <b>corpora</b> lutea as determined by Northern blot analysis and ELISA. Monocytes and macrophages were the most abundant immune cells detected <b>in</b> the bovine <b>corpus</b> luteum, followed by CD 8 (+) and CD 4 (+) T lymphocytes. In all instances, Day 6 corpora lutea contained fewer immune cells than corpora lutea from Days 12 and 18. In conclusion, increased expression of MCP- 1 was accompanied by the accumulation of immune cells <b>in</b> the <b>corpora</b> lutea of cows during {{the latter half of the}} estrous cycle (Days 12 - 18 postovulation). These results support the hypothesis that MCP- 1 promotes immune cell recruitment into the corpus luteum to facilitate luteal regression.
