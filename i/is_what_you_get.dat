He left Microsoft in 2002 to co-found, with business partner Gregor Kiczales, a company called Intentional Software. This company markets the intentional programming concepts Simonyi developed at Microsoft Research. In this approach to software, a programmer first builds a language environment specific to a given problem domain (such as life insurance). Domain experts, aided by the programmer, then describe the program's intended behavior in a What You See <b>Is</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Get</b> (WYSIWYG)-like manner. An automated system uses the program description and the language to generate the final program. Successive changes are only done at the WYSIWYG level.|$|E
500|$|Among other Harrison biographers' {{interpretations of}} the lyrics, Ian Inglis writes of Harrison's unwelcome [...] "evangelical" [...] message {{regarding}} [...] "the consequences of a life of selfishness and greed which finds no place for 'the Lord'". In contrast, Leng views the verses as [...] "the singer's inner conversation", in which Harrison acknowledges the futility of his own existence, {{at a time when}} he felt overwhelmed by his success as a solo artist following the Beatles' break-up in 1970. Of the apparent sermonising in the choruses, Leng concludes: [...] "'The Lord Loves the One' conveys the same basic message as 'what you put in <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> out,' so, at one level, it's more a matter of common sense than divine revelation." ...|$|E

With barely any breathing time between songs, the underground drum legend shows that an impending 40th birthday (next month) isn't going to slow him down." [...] Patrizio stated the production was not of the highest caliber, as the rapid [...] "MTV-style" [...] cuts were distracting, as was the switch from black and white to color shots. Patrizio ended the review with the comment, [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> for letting Uwe Boll direct your music video", Boll being a heavily criticized film director.|$|E

500|$|BBC America {{described}} Gilly {{on their}} official website stating: [...] "His most endearing quality is his honesty {{and despite his}} countless flaws, what you see <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>get.</b> He's hardly a ladykiller but what he lacks in appearance he makes up for with charisma." [...] E4 publicity describe Gilly as fun-loving and always trying to woo females but hardly manages to impress them and has also been described as unlucky-in-love after his failed relationships. Initially he failed to impress females and didn't {{have much in common}} with them. Gilly has been portrayed as a strong supporter of Manchester City F.C., it was this single thing that drew him and Beth Clement (Sinéad Moynihan) together. Gilly was later made a fool by Beth and his best friend Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss) after they continued an affair despite the fact they were siblings, they split, Beth subsequently died and due to Gilly's forgiving personality he later forgave Rhys. Holy Soap opined that this was a stand out moment of the character's duration. Another storyline showing his timid personality was when he was mugged by a group of teenagers and was left fearing for his safety and even let them pick on him on the streets. In a further twist Gilly was left feeling so ashamed of the attack he pretended it was adult attackers fearing what people would think of him.|$|E
500|$|In 1969, the Revue's {{profile in}} their home country was raised after opening for the Rolling Stones on their US tour. In 1970, they {{performed}} on The Ed Sullivan Show. The tour's success resulted in the Revue signing with Liberty Records, where they released two albums, Come Together and Workin' Together, released in 1970 and 1971 respectively. Come Together produced the duo's first top 40 single with their cover of Sly and the Family Stone's [...] "I Want to Take You Higher." [...] Come Together marked {{a turning point in}} their careers in which they switched from their usual R repertoire to incorporate more rock tunes. In early 1971, their cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival's [...] "Proud Mary" [...] became their biggest hit, reaching number 4 on the Hot 100 and selling over a million copies, winning them a Grammy for Best R Performance by a Duo or Group. Later in 1971, their live album, What You Hear <b>Is</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Get,</b> taken from a performance at Carnegie Hall, was their first to be certified gold. In 1972, Ike Turner created the studio, Bolic Sounds, near their home in Inglewood. After Liberty was bought by United Artists Records, the duo was assigned to that label, releasing ten albums in a three-year period. The duo's final major hit single, [...] "Nutbush City Limits", was released in 1973, reaching number 22 on the Hot 100, and peaking at number 4 in the UK. In 1974, Tina released her first solo album, Tina Turns the Country On!, winning a Grammy nomination.|$|E

Through the lenses of social influence and interdependence theories, this meta-analysis investigated (a) {{the magnitude of the}} rela-tionship between these 3 self-presentation tactics and interviewer ratings, (b) whether these tactics also are correlated with later job performance, and (c) whether important theoretical moderators (e. g., the level of interview structure, the rating source, the use of field or experimental designs) affect these relation-ships. Results reveal that <b>what</b> <b>you</b> see in the interview may not <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> on the job and that the unstructured interview is particularly impacted by these self-presentation tactics. Additionally and surprisingly, moderator analyses of these relationships found that the type of research design (experi-mental vs. field) does not moderate these findings...|$|R

2500|$|Other early word-processing {{software}} required users to memorize semi-mnemonic key combinations rather than pressing keys labelled [...] "copy" [...] or [...] "bold". (In fact, many early PCs lacked cursor keys; WordStar famously used the E-S-D-X-centered [...] "diamond" [...] for cursor navigation, and modern vi-like editors encourage use of hjkl for navigation.) However, the price differences between dedicated word processors and general-purpose PCs, {{and the value}} added to the latter by software such as VisiCalc, were so compelling that personal computers and word processing software soon became serious competition for the dedicated machines. Word processing became the most popular use for personal computers, and unlike the spreadsheet (dominated by Lotus 1-2-3) and database (dBase) markets, WordPerfect, XyWrite, Microsoft Word, , {{and dozens of other}} word processing software brands competed in the 1980s; PC Magazine reviewed 57 different programs in one January 1986 issue.

2500|$|Rock {{and roll}} music {{first came to}} Carnegie Hall when Bill Haley & His Comets {{appeared}} in a variety benefit concert on May 6, 1955. Rock acts were not regularly booked at the Hall however, until February 12, 1964, when The Beatles performed two shows during their historic {{first trip to the}} United States. Promoter Sid Bernstein convinced Carnegie officials that allowing a Beatles concert at the venue [...] "would further international understanding" [...] between the United States and Great Britain. [...] "Led Zeppelin became the first hard rock act to play Carnegie Hall since the Rolling Stones tore the place up some five years ago." [...] Two concerts were performed October 17, 1969. Since then numerous rock, blues, jazz and country performers have appeared at the hall every season. Jethro Tull released the tapes recorded on its presentation in a 1970 Benefit concert, in the 2010 re-release of the Stand Up album. Ike & Tina Turner performed a concert April 1, 1971, which resulted in their album What You Hear <b>is</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Get.</b> The Beach Boys played concerts in 1971 and 1972, and two songs from the show appeared on their Endless Harmony Soundtrack.
