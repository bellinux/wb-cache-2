5|$|By 1950, {{more than}} half of all {{employment}} was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>manufacturing</b> sector. Due to economic difficulties, Studebaker closed its automotive manufacturing plants in South Bend in December 1963. A general decline in manufacturing soon followed as industry was being restructured nationwide. By the year 2000, manufacturing was only 16 percent of the local economy. Due to the severe loss of jobs, the city's population decreased by nearly 30,000 people during that period.|$|E

5|$|According to a 2011 PricewaterhouseCoopers report, India's GDP at {{purchasing}} power parity could overtake {{that of the}} United States by 2045. During the next four decades, Indian GDP {{is expected to grow}} at an annualised average of 8%, making it potentially the world's fastest-growing major economy until 2050. The report highlights key growth factors: a young and rapidly growing working-age population; growth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>manufacturing</b> sector because of rising education and engineering skill levels; and sustained growth of the consumer market driven by a rapidly growing middle class. The World Bank cautions that, for India to achieve its economic potential, it must continue to focus on public sector reform, transport infrastructure, agricultural and rural development, removal of labour regulations, education, energy security, and public health and nutrition.|$|E
5|$|Believing that {{it would}} be an {{advantage}} for his son to gain a greater technical knowledge, Lilly sent Josiah to the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy in 1880. Upon returning to the family business in 1882, Josiah was named superintendent of the laboratory. In 1890, Lilly turned over the day-to day management of the business to Josiah, who ran the company for thirty-four years. The company flourished despite the tumultuous economic conditions in the 1890s. In 1894, Lilly purchased a manufacturing plant to be used solely for creating capsules. The company made several technological advances <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>manufacturing</b> process, including the automation of capsule production. Over the next few years, the company annually created tens of millions of capsules and pills.|$|E
5|$|Canada's {{economic}} integration with the United States has increased significantly since World War II. The Automotive Products Trade Agreement of 1965 opened Canada's borders {{to trade in}} the automobile manufacturing industry. In the 1970s, concerns over energy self-sufficiency and foreign ownership <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>manufacturing</b> sectors prompted Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's Liberal government to enact the National Energy Program (NEP) and the Foreign Investment Review Agency (FIRA). In the 1980s, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservatives abolished the NEP and changed the name of FIRA to Investment Canada, to encourage foreign investment. The Canada– United States Free Trade Agreement (FTA) of 1988 eliminated tariffs between the two countries, while the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) expanded the free-trade zone to include Mexico in 1994.|$|E

5|$|On {{the whole}} Australian {{commerce}} was expanded {{due to the}} war, although {{the cost of the}} war was quite considerable and the Australian government had to borrow considerably from overseas to fund the war effort. In terms of value, Australian exports rose almost 45 per cent, while the number of Australians employed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>manufacturing</b> industry increased over 11 per cent. This was due in the most part to the reduced ability of traditional sources to continue supplying Australia with manufactured products, which out of necessity stimulated the development of the Australian manufacturing industry.|$|E

The opening was preceded by soft openings of each individual station, beginning with Westlake station in August 1989, and ending with Convention Place station the day before the beginning of service.

5|$|Synthetic {{diamonds}} {{for use as}} gemstones {{are grown}} by HPHT or CVD methods, and currently represent approximately 2% of the gem-quality diamond market. However, {{there are indications that}} the market share of synthetic jewelry-quality diamonds may grow as advances in technology allows for larger higher-quality synthetic production on a more economic scale. They are available in yellow and blue, {{and to a lesser extent}} colorless (or white). The yellow color comes from nitrogen impurities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>manufacturing</b> process, while the blue color comes from boron. Other colors, such as pink or green, are achievable after synthesis using irradiation. Several companies also offer memorial diamonds grown using cremated remains.|$|E
5|$|The band {{started their}} second US tour in April 1969 with little support from their almost-bankrupt American label and without an album to promote, {{because of a}} delay <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>manufacturing</b> of the new LP. During the tour, Deep Purple showed a {{remarkable}} progress as performers and a musical direction more oriented towards a heavier and louder sound than before. Doubts about compatibility of vocalist Rod Evans with the hard rock music that other band members wanted to pursue brought about the decision of searching for a substitute, which was found in Ian Gillan of the band Episode Six. Gillan formed a songwriting duo with Episode Six's bassist Roger Glover, who was also invited to join Deep Purple and replaced Nick Simper. The band's new line-up, identified as Mark II, debuted live in London on 10 July 1969.|$|E

5|$|The growth {{witnessed}} {{in the late}} 1970s and early 1980s was interrupted by another U.S. recession in 1981, in which silver, timber, and farm prices dropped. The period of decline for the city lasted into the 1990s and was also marked by a loss of many steady family-wage jobs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>manufacturing</b> sector. Although this was a tough period, Spokane's economy had started to benefit from some measure of economic diversification; growing companies such as Key Tronic and other research, marketing, and assembly plants for technology companies helped lessen Spokane's dependence on natural resources.|$|E
5|$|Though Newark {{is not the}} {{industrial}} colossus of the past, the city does have {{a considerable amount of}} industry and light manufacturing. The southern portion of the Ironbound, also known as the Industrial Meadowlands, has seen many factories built since World War II, including a large Anheuser-Busch brewery that opened in 1951 and distributed 7.5 million barrels of beer in 2007. The service industry is also growing rapidly, replacing those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>manufacturing</b> industry, which was once Newark's primary economy. In addition, transportation has become a large business in Newark, accounting for more than 17,000 jobs in 2011.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1990s, Brazilian and Russian {{authorities}} conducted {{talks on}} the possible acquisition of the Su-27M. In 2001, the Brazilian government launched the F-X tender, the objective of which was to procure at least twelve aircraft to replace the Brazilian Air Force's ageing aircraft, primarily the Mirage IIIs. Since the Brazilian government was also looking to develop the country's aerospace and defence industries, Sukhoi partnered with the Brazilian defence contractor Avibras during the tender. The two companies submitted the Su-27M to the US$700-million tender, and included an offset agreement wherein the Brazilian industry would participate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>manufacturing</b> of certain aircraft equipment. The tender was suspended in 2003 because of domestic political issues and then scrapped in 2005, pending the availability of new fighters. The Su-27M was preferred over the next favourite, the Mirage 2000BR; had the aircraft been purchased, {{it would have been}} the first heavy fighter delivered to Latin America.|$|E
