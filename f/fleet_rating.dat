40|$|The {{changes taking}} place in the global {{automotive}} industry related to alternative powertrains and fuels are affecting each country or region differently. Each country or region has its own policies in place to monitor and manage vehicle fuel consumption and emissions. Countries or regions also have different numbers of new vehicles sold annually and the total numbers of vehicles in their fleets. This analysis looks at the current and future direction of alternative powertrains/fuels across four developed economies (United States, Western Europe, Japan, and South Korea) and four developing economies (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) in order to measure the impact of increasing the number of alternative powertrains/fuels in their fleets. In particular, the analysis looks at the how much of each country’s fleet will turn over to vehicles based only on alternative powertrains/fuels by 2050 by introducing three different alternative powertrain/fuel models (less aggressive, moderately aggressive, and very aggressive). A less aggressive approach will yield <b>fleet</b> turnover <b>rates</b> of 60 percent or more for most countries, a moderately aggressive approach will yield <b>fleet</b> turnover <b>rates</b> of over 80 percent for most countries, and a very aggressive approach will yield <b>fleet</b> turnover <b>rates</b> of nearly 90 percent or more for most countries...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a design case for arctic LNG transport, where liquefied gas is shipped from the Kharasevey terminal in Northern Russia to markets in US and Europe. Based on a fleet simulation model, the trade-off {{between the two}} main performance issues related to arctic transport are investigated; namely how to maintain transport system integrity in the harsh ice conditions, while maximizing the capacity utilization in a situation with considerable seasonal variations. The fixed contract, single destination base case shows that meeting the requirements for a robust solution implies a low degree of utilization in the summer season. To improve upon this situation, several mitigating strategies are evaluated, including vessel speed and size changes, fixed and seasonally varying contract and market mix schedules, revision stop re-scheduling, storage capacity extensions and backhauling. The results indicate a high payoff from renegotiating the initial fixed schedule contract {{to allow for a}} higher degree of seasonal variations in the LNG deliveries. Further, increased storage capacity in loading port, combined with winter revision stops will {{have a significant impact on}} both fleet utilization and total system integrity. Flexible contracts that implies seasonal deliveries to the UK will help ensure continuous production and deliveries in winter season. Finally, surplus capacity gives opportunities for seasonal spot cargoes that could be exploited to increase <b>fleet</b> utilization <b>rate...</b>|$|R
50|$|Some have {{suggested}} that the initial price of the RL is perceived to be out of its bracket. As the new RL offered more features and performance than the base version of its luxury competitions (i.e., the base six-cylinder BMW 5 Series), Honda Japan suggested that it could charge more, though Honda Canada disagreed. The RLs initial MRSP was $69,500 CAD, more than the six-cylinder BMW 525i and close to that of the V8-powered BMW 545i. At the RLs price point, most consumers expected a V8, furthermore they did not perceive Acura as being on par with its German rivals and expected more value from the Japanese marque. The damage from Honda Japans alleged hubris was done, perhaps giving the RL an unfavorable impression that could not be removed, even though Honda Canada has since reduced the RLs price. The UK magazine `Car` ran a Honda Legend on its long term <b>fleet</b> and <b>rated</b> the car for its performance, handling and acceleration but felt the styling was too anonymous. In 2009, the new generation of the Acura TL was released and it is expected to offer tough competition to the RL, as the TL has essentially the same engine (but with 5 more horsepower), the SH-AWD system, similar dimensions, and many of the RLs features for only $44,900 CAD.|$|R
40|$|Worldwide, the {{increasing}} deterioration in urban air quality due to vehicle emissions {{has created the}} need for greater capacity in air quality management and more comprehensive knowledge about the sources and spatial and temporal distribution of vehicle emissions, without which impact studies and subsequent mitigation policy cannot be formulated. To investigate this proposition and assist with the design/development of new air quality information tools for this evolving context, this research examines the generation and use of air quality information in New Zealand, through two case studies. The first case study examines NZTER, a tool used for generating 'vehicle <b>fleet</b> emission <b>rates</b> information' used {{in a number of}} different models for air quality assessment and transport policy. The second case examines the early stages of the development and operationalisation of an integrated environmental management tool, the VFEM-w, which hopes to quantify/model the type, source and pathways of airborne pollutants entering the urban stormwater water system. While the NZTER is uncomplicated, it is inefficient and produces information of insufficient quality in the current policy-making context. The VFEM-w case illustrates the challenges of attempting to embed a conceptually and technically complex model in an existing cultural, technical and political setting. Recommendations for the use and development of air quality information tools are made and closing comments consider the issue of information quality in sustainable management.

40|$|Offshore wind {{projects}} are moving towards deeper waters and more distinct locations {{in order to}} capture stronger winds and eventually increase power productivity. However, challenging climate conditions limit the operability and accessibility of the maintenance vessels significantly; therefore, the turbine downtimes due to vessel inaccessibility become dominant. Moreover, offshore wind farm operators in the UK only perform maintenance activities if there is enough daylight at the offshore wind farm {{in order to prevent}} potential accidents. These major difficulties influence the power production undesirably and increase the financial risks of the operating offshore wind farms. In this context, the focus of this research is the investigation of operational and financial benefits that multiple working shifts can bring to the operating offshore farms and the influence of the offshore wind farm location on the operational decisions. The operational simulations are performed by the offshore wind operational expenditure and logistics optimisation tool StrathOW-OM, which is developed by the University of Strathclyde and commercial partner organisations within Technology Innovation Centre (TIC) project. StrathOW-OM examines climate parameters (wind speed, wave height, and wave period) in the offshore wind farm location, size and operational characteristics of the maintenance <b>fleet,</b> failure <b>rates</b> of the turbine components. The operational simulations are performed through multiple scenarios in order to identify the most cost efficient solution.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore the {{dependence}} of vehicle emission profiles over a twenty-five year period on three factors: the rate of traffic growth (g), the <b>fleet</b> renewal <b>rate</b> (λ), and the technology ‘gain’ (θ) following a step change in emission standards. Using analytic and numerical methods we determine the conditions relating to g, λ, and θ which result in three types of emission profile. These consist of: type-I profiles, in which emissions continue to rise but at a reduced rate; type-II profiles which fall, attain a minimum, and subsequently rise from a lower base; and type-III profiles which continue to fall over a forecasting period. For all profiles we determine the total reduction in vehicle emissions arising from revised standards, and {{the sensitivity of the}} total emissions to changes in their determining factors. Data from the UK are used to illustrate the approach which is extended {{in a wide range of}} sensitivity tests to explore differences in emission profiles between advanced industrialised and rapidly developing countries. We show that while it may be necessary for all countries to rely on both technological and behavioural policy instruments to reduce emissions, in advanced industrialised countries it may be more effective to improve emission standards, while, in contrast, moderating the rate of traffic growth may be relatively more effective in the rapidly industrialising world. The profiles resulting from the change in emission standards accompanying the introduction of catalytic converters are used to illustrate the general approach. ...|$|R

The most substantial requirements {{come in the}} form of two separate CO2 standards (one for cars and the other for trucks, expressed on a gram per mile basis) that apply to a manufacturer's fleet of vehicles.

The emission standard for a manufacturer in a given model year is calculated based on the footprints of the vehicles in its fleet and the number of vehicles produced by the manufacturer at each footprint. The standards are designed so that they gradually become more stringent each year from 2012 to 2016. The LDV Rule also includes standards of 0.010 gram/mile and 0.030 gram/mile for N2O and CH4, respectively. These standards were primarily put in place as an anti-backsliding measure as N2O and CH4 are already emitted from motor vehicles in relatively low amounts.|$|R
