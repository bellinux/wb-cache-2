5|$|In December 1888 {{he painted}} La Berceuse – {{a figure that}} he thought {{as good as his}} sunflowers. It has a limited palette, varied brushstrokes and simple contours. It appears to be a {{culmination}} of portraits of the Roulin family completed in Arles between November and December. The portraits show a shift in style from the fluid, restrained brushstrokes and even surface of Portrait of the Postman to the frenetic style, rough surface, broad brushstrokes and use of a palette <b>knife</b> <b>in</b> Madame Roulin with Baby.|$|E
5|$|In the past, the standard-bearer of the Mrkojevići clan, a Muslim, walked next to {{the cross}} with a flag in his left and a <b>knife</b> <b>in</b> his right hand, ready to use it if anyone {{attempted}} to take the cross. The clan especially feared that the participants from Krajina might try to recover the sacred object. At the end of 19th century the number of Muslims in the procession dropped as their religious and political leaders disapproved of their participation in it. After World War II, Yugoslavia's socialist government discouraged public religious celebrations, and the procession was not held between 1959 and 1984.|$|E

5|$|The Ottoman Empire spread {{further the}} use of this type of <b>knife.</b> <b>In</b> the Balkans, where it was known as Handschar, such knives were {{regularly}} carried by Ottoman policemen, and it remained in local use also after the end of Ottoman rule. During the Second World War, the knife's name was bestowed on the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian), composed of Bosnian Muslims (ethnic Bosniaks) with some Catholic Croat soldiers; the knife also appeared on the division's emblem.|$|E

5|$|Maeda {{was still}} popular in Brazil, and {{recognized}} as a great fighter, although he only fought sporadically after his return.

The capoeirista was 190cm tall and weighed 100kg. Maeda won the match quickly. In 1921, Maeda founded his first judo academy in Brazil. It was called Clube Remo, and its building was a 4 m x 4 m shed. Later, it {{was moved to the}} Fire Brigade headquarters and then to the church of N. S. de Aparecida.

5|$|As {{a direct}} result of {{watching}} his fellow martial artists train with a fixed-blade fighting <b>knife</b> <b>in</b> class, yet carry some type of a folding knife when they left the training area, Emerson decided there was a need for a sturdy folding knife designed primarily for combat. Although Emerson had always maintained that the knives he made were built as fighting knives first and foremost, in October 1985 he stripped down five of these designs to simpler materials. He continued his use of linen or canvas micarta because of its high tensile strength and superior gripping surface when wet; he decided on black or dark grey for the color instead of the brighter colors used previously. He retained the titanium for the liners and bolsters but chose to bead-blast them a flat grey matte color as opposed to the colorful anodizing which used to appear on his knives. The reasons for using titanium were its exceptional strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance.|$|E
5|$|Mamie Till Bradley and Emmett lived {{together}} in a busy neighborhood in Chicago's South Side, near distant relatives. She began working as a civilian clerk for the U.S. Air Force for a better salary. She recalled that Emmett was industrious enough to help with chores at home, although he sometimes got distracted. His mother remembered {{that he did not}} know his own limitations at times. Following the couple's separation, Bradley visited Mamie and began threatening her. At eleven years old, Emmett, with a butcher <b>knife</b> <b>in</b> hand, told Bradley he would kill him if the man did not leave. Usually, however, Emmett was happy. He and his cousins and friends pulled pranks on each other (Emmett once took advantage of an extended car ride when his friend fell asleep and placed the friend's underwear on his head), and they also spent their free time in pickup baseball games. He was a natty dresser and was often the center of attention among his peers.|$|E
