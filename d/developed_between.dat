5|$|A {{complex set}} of checks and {{balances}} <b>developed</b> <b>between</b> these three branches. For example, the assemblies theoretically held all power, but were called and governed by the magistrates, who, controlling discussion, exercised dominating influence over them. Similarly, to check the power of the magistrates, each magistrate could veto one of their colleagues and the plebeians elected tribunes who could intercede and veto the actions of a magistrate.|$|E
5|$|A fleet was {{necessary}} for the defeat of Japan, and eventually a sizeable one, the British Pacific Fleet, did go to the Far East, where it fought alongside the United States Pacific Fleet. The closer relations that <b>developed</b> <b>between</b> the two navies prior to the outbreak of war with Japan, and the alliance that developed from it afterwards, became the most positive and enduring strategic legacy of the Singapore strategy.|$|E
5|$|Between 1812 and 1816 {{divisions}} <b>developed</b> <b>between</b> an Unitarist faction {{centred on}} Buenos Aires and a Federalist faction in the provinces, which {{eventually led to}} a series of civil wars that ended with the conquest of Buenos Aires by Federalist caudillos at the Battle of Cepeda in 1820.|$|E

5|$|Romanticism in Scotland was an artistic, {{literary}} and intellectual movement that <b>developed</b> <b>between</b> {{the late eighteenth}} and the early nineteenth centuries. It {{was part of the}} wider European Romantic movement, which was partly a reaction against the Age of Enlightenment, emphasising individual, national and emotional responses, moving beyond Renaissance and Classicist models, particularly to the Middle Ages.|$|E

5|$|The Americans {{were more}} open to negotiating.

5|$|A {{complication}} arose when Venancio Sanchez of St. Augustine {{purchased for}} US$400 a half {{share in the}} old Fornells grant from another surviving heir, who lived in Havana. A feud quickly <b>developed</b> <b>between</b> Sanchez and the Davises, with Sanchez demanding {{a division of the}} property, and the Davises refusing to acknowledge that Sanchez had any claim to the island. The Davises had hoped that a restored lighthouse would be the centerpiece of their town, but all attempts to repair the lighthouse failed while the war was on. Shortly {{after the end of the}} war, the Davises gave up on Key Biscayne and moved to Texas. Their older son Edmund J. Davis eventually was elected as governor there.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} depression <b>developed</b> <b>between</b> the Cape Verde islands {{and the west}} coast of Africa on August18, although it was not classified as a tropical cyclone for another week. The depression tracked west-southwestward for three days, followed by a turn to the west and later west-northwest. Late on August24 it intensified into a tropical storm about 700mi (1100km) east-northeast of Guadeloupe in the Lesser Antilles. The next day, the Miami Weather Bureau Office initiated advisories on Tropical Storm Able after the Hurricane Hunters confirmed the presence of a poorly defined center. Continuing to the west-northwest, the storm passed north of Puerto Rico and attained hurricane status on August27.|$|E

5|$|After {{moving to}} Los Angeles {{to pursue a}} career in the fashion {{industry}} in May 2006, Conrad was commissioned to star in her own spin-off series The Hills, which chronicled the personal and professional lives of her and friends Heidi Montag, Audrina Patridge, and Whitney Port. During its production, she attended the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising and held positions with Teen Vogue and Kelly Cutrone's PR firm People's Revolution. As the series progressed, a widely publicized feud <b>developed</b> <b>between</b> Conrad, Montag and Montag's boyfriend Spencer Pratt. Consequently, the conflict became the central focus of the series, and was carried through each subsequent season in which Conrad appeared.|$|E
5|$|An initial {{prototype}} design was <b>developed</b> <b>between</b> January and May 1964. When used with MAR, the MSR needed only short range, enough to hand off the Sprint missiles. This {{led to a}} design with limited radiated power. For Small City Defense, this would not offer enough power to acquire the warheads at reasonable range. This led to an upgraded design with five times the transmitter power, which was sent to Raytheon in May 1965. A further upgrade in May 1966 included the battle control computers and other features for the SCD system.|$|E
5|$|As of {{the early}} 2000s, the Theta Company owns some tracts {{of land in the}} {{watershed}} of Leggetts Creek. These include areas around the Griffin Reservoir and Maple Lake. Some property along the creek's floodplain is owned by the city of Scranton. Additionally, there are parcels of abandoned mine lands {{in the vicinity of the}} creek in northern Scranton. These parcels may be developed by the 2020s. The major neighborhoods in the watershed include historic residential neighborhoods that were <b>developed</b> <b>between</b> 1870 and 1920.|$|E

5|$|By early 1844, a rift <b>developed</b> <b>between</b> Smith and a {{half dozen}} of his closest associates. Most notably, William Law, Smith's trusted counselor, and Robert Foster, a general of the Nauvoo Legion, {{disagreed}} with Smith about how to manage Nauvoo's economy. Both also said that Smith had proposed marriage to their wives. Believing the dissidents were plotting against his life, Smith excommunicated them on April 18, 1844. These dissidents formed a competing church and the following month, at Carthage, the county seat, they procured indictments against Smith for perjury and polygamy.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1860s a deep rift had <b>developed</b> <b>between</b> Irataba, who was {{proactive}} in cooperating with white settlers, and Homoseh quahote, who passively tolerated {{but did not}} approve of white encroachment on Mohave lands. Irataba was Aha macave yaltanack of the Mohave from 1861 to 1866, but from 1867 to 1869 opinions differ, and by 1870 US government correspondence suggests that Homoseh quahote had succeeded him {{as leader of the}} Fort Mohave group.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{successful}} collaboration on the pitch, {{a strong}} personal rivalry <b>developed</b> <b>between</b> Ramsey and Nicholson, partly because both {{liked the idea}} of staying on at Tottenham in a coaching role after retiring. Rowe made clear to Ramsey that he wanted him to do so, but unfortunately for him Rowe stepped down in February 1955, citing health issues. Another challenge to Ramsey's position at Tottenham {{came in the form of}} Danny Blanchflower, a Northern Ireland international wing-half signed from Aston Villa to replace Nicholson. Blanchflower was a more attacking player than Nicholson and thus did not provide the necessary cover for Ramsey to advance upfield; Ramsey also resented the idea that Blanchflower might supplant him as Tottenham's main strategist.|$|E

In October 1970, Obote {{took control of the}} armed forces, reducing Amin from his months-old post of commander of all the armed forces to that of commander of the army.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Sinatra {{worked with}} Quincy Jones {{for the first}} time in nearly two decades on the album, L.A. Is My Lady, which was well {{received}} critically. The album was a substitute for another Jones project, an album of duets with Lena Horne, which had to be abandoned. In 1986, Sinatra collapsed on stage while performing in Atlantic City and was hospitalized for diverticulitis, which left him looking frail. Two years later, Sinatra reunited with Martin and Davis, Jr. and went on the Rat Pack Reunion Tour, during which they played a number of large arenas. When Martin dropped out of the tour early on, a rift <b>developed</b> <b>between</b> them and the two never spoke again.|$|E
5|$|Later {{excursions}} by the Romans {{were generally}} {{limited to the}} scouting expeditions in the buffer zone that <b>developed</b> <b>between</b> the walls, trading contacts, bribes to purchase truces from the natives, and eventually the spread of Christianity. The Ravenna Cosmography utilises a 3rd- or 4th-century Roman map and identifies four loci (meeting places, possibly markets) in southern Scotland. Locus Maponi is possibly the modern Lochmabenstane near Gretna which continued {{to be used as}} a muster point well into the historic period. Two of the others indicate meeting places of the Damnonii and Selgovae, and the fourth, Manavi may be Clackmannan. From the time of Caracalla onwards, no further attempts were made to permanently occupy territory in Scotland.|$|E
