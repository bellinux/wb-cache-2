25|$|The Buddhist {{religious}} establishment discovered {{new opportunities}} for political gain and financial profit. Despite {{the presence of a}} state government, real power lay in the Bogd Khaan's court. The religious establishment appropriated revenues for its own purposes. For example, it enlarged its <b>financial</b> <b>holdings</b> by transferring to the religious estate (Ikh shav) wealthy herdsmen who traditionally had owed their services and taxes to lay princes. There is a commonly held misconception that, over time, the greed of the Buddhist religious establishment so disaffected the lay nobility that it came to reject the very principles of theocracy upon which the new country had been founded. According to Mongolian and Russian sources, the Mongolian society was generally satisfied with the theocracy but there were different views on future development of the country.|$|E

Although Falcone had been threatened before, this failed attempt bothered him in the extreme because it had all the signs of an inside job. At the time, he was meeting Swiss prosecutors Carla Del Ponte and Claudio Lehman from Lugano who were helping to investigate the Mafia's <b>financial</b> <b>holdings</b> in Switzerland. Falcone believed that the assassination attempt not only involved the Mafia but some people in government as well.

500|$|At this time, {{there were}} only 2,500 {{soldiers}} in the Mexican interior. [...] This {{was not enough to}} crush a rebellion and provide security—from attacks by both Indians and federalists—throughout the rest of the country. [...] According to author Will Fowler, Santa Anna financed the Texas expedition with three loans; one from the city of San Luis Potosí, and the other two loans from individuals Cayetano Rubio and Juan N. Errazo. Santa Anna had guaranteed at least a portion of the repayments with his own <b>financial</b> <b>holdings.</b> He began to assemble a new army, which he dubbed the Army of Operations in Texas. [...] A majority of the troops had been conscripted or were convicts who chose service in the military over jail. The Mexican officers knew that the Brown Bess muskets they carried lacked the range of the Texian weapons, but Santa Anna was convinced that his superior planning would nonetheless result in an easy victory. Corruption was rampant, and supplies were not plentiful. [...] Almost from the beginning, rations were short, and there were no medical supplies or doctors. Few troops were issued heavy coats or blankets for the winter.|$|E
500|$|By {{the last}} week of July, however, questions—due {{initially}} to reporting by The New York Times—began about Ferraro's finances, the finances of her husband, John Zaccaro, and their separately filed tax returns. (While the Mondale campaign had anticipated some questions, it had only spent 48 hours on vetting Ferraro's family's finances.) This was also the first time the American media had to deal with a national candidate's husband. Ferraro said she would release both their returns within a month, but maintained she was correct not to have included her husband's <b>financial</b> <b>holdings</b> on her past annual Congressional disclosure statements. The media also reported on the FEC's past investigation into Ferraro's 1978 campaign funds. Although Ferraro and Zaccaro's finances were often interwoven on paper, with each half partners in Zaccaro's company, Ferraro had little knowledge of his business, or even how much he was worth. Zaccaro did not understand the greater public exposure that his wife's new position brought to their family, and resisted releasing his financial information. On , Ferraro announced that her husband would not in fact be releasing his tax returns, on the grounds that to do so would disadvantage his real estate business and that such a disclosure was voluntary and not part of election law. She joked, [...] "You people who are married to Italian men, you know what it's like", angering fellow Italian Americans.|$|E

40|$|Systematic {{information}} on household <b>financial</b> asset <b>holdings</b> {{in developing countries}} is very sparse. The author reviews some available data and current policy debates. Although <b>financial</b> asset <b>holdings</b> by households are highly concentrated, deeper financial systems are correlated with improved income distribution. For low-income countries, the relevant question for poor households is not how much financial assets they have, but whether they have any access to financial products at all. Building on and synthesizing disparate data collection efforts by others, the author produces new estimates of access percentages for over 150 countries. Across countries access is negatively correlated with poverty rates, but the correlation is not a robust one: thus the supposed anti-poverty potential of financial access remains econometrically elusive. Despite policy focus {{on the value of}} credit instruments, it is deposit products that tend {{to be the first to}} be used as prosperity increases, before more sophisticated savings products and borrowing.

Most of Germany's reparations payments were funded by loans from American banks, and the recipients used them to pay off loans they had from the U.S. Treasury.

In February 2008, the country's LGT Bank was implicated in a tax-fraud scandal in Germany, which strained the ruling family's relationship with the German government.
