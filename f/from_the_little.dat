5|$|Very {{little is}} known of Saint Padarn (or Paternus to use his Latin name), and almost nothing {{with any degree of}} certainty; the {{earliest}} literary reference to him is by Rhygyfarch in about 1097. However, it is possible to construct a general outline of his life <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> that we do have.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} of Rapunzel has been generally positive, with critics complimenting her spirited, lively personality and independence. The tenth Disney Princess, Rapunzel was officially {{inducted into the}} line-up on October 2, 2011, becoming the franchise's first computer-animated member. Her physical appearance and personality have drawn much comparison between her and preceding Disney Princess Ariel <b>from</b> <b>The</b> <b>Little</b> Mermaid (1989), by whom she was inspired.|$|E
5|$|The rest of {{this edition}} I have not read, but, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> that I have seen, I think it not {{dangerous}} to declare that, in my opinion, its pomp recommends it more than its accuracy. There is no distinction made between the ancient reading, and the innovations of the editor; {{there is no reason}} given for any of the alterations which are made; the emendations of former editions are adopted without any acknowledgement, and few of the difficulties are removed which have hitherto embarrassed the readers of Shakespeare.|$|E

5|$|Fourteen {{species of}} seabirds breed on the island. Red-tailed tropicbirds {{can be seen}} in large numbers {{circling}} the Malabar cliffs where they perform acrobatic courting rituals. Between August and May thousands of flesh-footed and wedge-tailed shearwaters return to the island at dusk each day. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> Island Track between March and November one of the world's rarest birds, the providence petrel also performs courtship displays during winter breeding and it is extremely tame. The island was its only breeding location for many years after the breeding colony on Norfolk Island was exterminated in the late 19th century; though a small population persists on the adjacent Phillip Island. The Kermadec petrel was discovered breeding on Mount Gower in 1914 by ornithologist Roy Bell while collecting specimens for Gregory Mathews and the black-winged petrel was only confirmed as a breeder in 1971; its numbers have increased following the elimination of feral cats from the island.|$|E
5|$|Just {{north of}} the city centre, Østerbro is an upper middle-class {{district}} with a number of fine mansions, some now serving as embassies. The district stretches from Nørrebro to the waterfront where The Little Mermaid statue {{can be seen from the}} promenade known as Langelinie. Inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale, it was created by Edvard Eriksen and unveiled in 1913. Not far <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> Mermaid, the old Citadel (Kastellet) can be seen. Built by Christian IV, it is one of northern Europe's best preserved fortifications. There is also a windmill in the area. The large Gefion Fountain (Gefionspringvandet) designed by Anders Bundgaard and completed in 1908 stands close to the southeast corner of Kastellet. Its figures illustrate a Nordic legend.|$|E
5|$|Sauropelta {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} known nodosaurids. All specimens of S. edwardsorum were recovered <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> Sheep Mudstone section of the Cloverly Formation in Wyoming and Montana, which has been dated to 108.5 million years ago, during the Early Cretaceous. Sauropelta lived in wide floodplains around rivers that drained into the shallow inland sea to the north and east, carrying sediment eroded from the low mountains to the west. Periodic flooding of these rivers covered the surrounding plains with new muddy sediments, creating the Cloverly Formation and burying the remains of many animals, some of which would be fossilized. At the end of Cloverly times, the shallow sea would expand to cover the entire region and would eventually split North America completely in half, forming the Western Interior Seaway. Abundant fossil remains of coniferous trees suggest that these plains were covered in forests. Grasses would not evolve until later in the Cretaceous, so Sauropelta and other Early Cretaceous dinosaurian herbivores browsed from a variety of conifers and cycads. Nodosaurids like Sauropelta had narrow snouts, an adaptation seen today in animals that are selective browsers as opposed to the wide muzzles of grazers.|$|E

5|$|The MD 198 {{divided highway}} was {{extended}} west from Sweitzer Lane {{to what was}} then US 29 in 1985. That same year, the state highway was expanded to a divided highway from US 1 to the Patuxent River. MD 198 was rebuilt as a divided highway from the Patuxent River to {{just west of the}} Baltimore–Washington Parkway in 1987. The divided highway was extended through the parkway interchange in 1991. As part of the construction, the original five-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange had a loop ramp added from the northbound parkway to westbound MD 198. That same year, MD 198 was extended east <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> Patuxent River to newly constructed MD 32 in Fort Meade. The state highway's western terminus was relocated from an acute intersection with MD 650 to an orthogonal intersection in 1997. The west leg of the intersection became operational when the extended Norbeck Road, a county highway connecting the ends of MD 28 and MD 198, opened in 2004. MD 198's eastern end was extended along its current course when the MD 198–MD 32 dumbbell interchange was completed in 2002. The MD 198–US 29 interchange opened in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most of Disney's princesses, Jasmine {{holds the}} {{distinction}} of being a supporting character in her own film, having been relegated to the secondary role of love interest. The character has garnered mixed reviews, with much denunciation directed towards her storyline and personality, both of which critics have dismissed as uninteresting and unoriginal; they have also accused Jasmine of lacking the depth of her predecessors Ariel and Belle <b>from</b> <b>The</b> <b>Little</b> Mermaid (1989) and Beauty and the Beast (1991), respectively, to whom she continues to be heavily compared. However, as the sixth Disney Princess and the franchise's first non-white member, the character is credited with introducing racial diversity to Disney's princess genre, although she has at the same time been criticized for being Westernized and Anglicized in both appearance and demeanor. Jasmine has made subsequent appearances in Aladdins sequels The Return of Jafar (1994) and Aladdin and the King of Thieves (1996), as well as its television series and a Broadway musical adaption of the film. Both Larkin and Salonga have been awarded Disney Legends for their contributions to the role. Naomi Scott is set to play a live-action version of the character in a live action adaptation of the 1992 film.|$|E
25|$|Colter Ranch is {{situated}} in the portion of Round Valley known as Amity Valley, the valley's name being derived from the Mormon ward which was located here in the 1800s.

25|$|The {{boundaries}} of the historic district are the Little Colorado River to the north, 4th Street to the south, and School Bus Road to the west.

25|$|By 1750, {{nearly all}} Native Americans had left New Jersey. This {{was due to}} land {{purchases}} from the Native Americans, diseases that the Native Americans contracted from Europeans, and due to starvation <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> Ice Age, during which Native American corn crops failed and rivers froze, preventing fishing. Snow storms sent game into semi-hibernation or made them difficult to find. Nut crops such as oak, hickory, beech, walnut, chestnut and butternut failed some years due to late frosts in spring. Due to all the events that happened, Native Americans went to eastern Canada and others went to the Ohio Valley. The Walking Purchase in September 1737, prevented Native Americans from going to eastern Pennsylvania. At that time, European settlement grew swiftly as there was now land to be farmed and settled.|$|E

25|$|Authorized in October 1864 at the Rock Island {{prisoner}} camp in Illinois as {{a one-year}} regiment, the 2nd U.S.V.I. was not organized until February 1865. It {{was ordered to}} the Department of the Missouri and sent by rail to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where it was assigned to duty in the District of Upper Arkansas along the Santa Fe Trail <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> Arkansas River to Fort Dodge, Kansas, and along the Cimarron Crossing to Fort Lyon, Colorado. From Fort Leavenworth the unit marched to Fort Riley, and stationed companies there and at Salem, Fort Ellsworth, Fort Larned, Fort Zarah and Fort Scott, Kansas. Companies F and G {{were involved in the}} establishment of Fort Dodge in the summer of 1865. Their duties involved scouting, wagon train escort and operating against Indians. Members of the regiment were present as guards at the signing of the Little Arkansas Treaty. The regiment mustered out at Fort Leavenworth November 7, 1865.|$|E
25|$|The canal was {{relatively}} successful {{prior to the}} arrival of railways. Traffic figures are scarce, but in 1798, 28,571 tons of coal were recorded, of which 40 per cent came <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> Eaton gangway. By 1803 this had risen to 50,374 tons, with 55 per cent from the gangway. Rather than it just supplying Derby, the company encouraged through trade on the canal, and this contributed to its profitability. Regular dividends were paid to shareholders from 1811, although some had been paid in previous years. Initially, they were close to the 5 per cent promised by the original Act, but reached 12 per cent in 1839. Although this exceeded the amount specified by the Act, it was justified as covering years where the 5 per cent had not been made. Traffic figures for February and March 1839 indicate that the Little Eaton line carried 13,332 tons, the Sandiacre line carried 15,725 tons, and 9,773 tons were carried on the Swarkestone line. This would suggest that the total for the year was around 200,000 tons.|$|E
25|$|As a teenager, he {{was greatly}} {{troubled by the}} Metaphysics of Aristotle, which he could not {{understand}} until he read al-Farabi's commentary on the work. For {{the next year and}} a half, he studied philosophy, in which he encountered greater obstacles. In such moments of baffled inquiry, he would leave his books, perform the requisite ablutions, then go to the mosque, and continue in prayer till light broke on his difficulties. Deep into the night, he would continue his studies, and even in his dreams problems would pursue him and work out their solution. Forty times, it is said, he read through the Metaphysics of Aristotle, till the words were imprinted on his memory; but their meaning was hopelessly obscure, until one day they found illumination, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> commentary by Farabi, which he bought at a bookstall for the small sum of three dirhams. So great was his joy at the discovery, made {{with the help of a}} work from which he had expected only mystery, that he hastened to return thanks to God, and bestowed alms upon the poor.|$|E
