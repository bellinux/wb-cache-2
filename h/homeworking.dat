40|$|<b>Homework</b> is a {{universal}} school practice. Most <b>homework</b> research has concerned itself with  student learning and achievement and time spent on homework;  parental involvement in <b>homework</b> that supports learning from homework; and  the development of student self-regulatory, independent learning skills. In Australia, each state and territory has an educational authority <b>homework</b> policy for schools. However, there is limited research that has explored <b>homework</b> policy influences on teacher perspectives about <b>homework</b> and teacher-in-action <b>homework</b> practices {{in the context of}} a <b>homework</b> policy-perspectives-practice interface. Teacher perspectives about <b>homework</b> were explored using focus groups and teacher-inaction teacher <b>homework</b> practices were explored using the stimulated recall (SR) method. Four inter-related findings emanated from this research, namely that:  teachers interpret state and school-based <b>homework</b> policy guidelines and implement them through the use of individualised teacher <b>homework</b> repertoires of practice;  teacher <b>homework</b> repertoires of practice respond to the influences of policy, teacher view, parental involvement in <b>homework</b> and student learning;  there are distinct differences in the orientation to the <b>homework</b> approach evidenced in the repertoire of <b>homework</b> practices between primary classroom teachers in the early years and middle years phases of learning; and  an analogous relationship exists between primary classroom teacher perspectives about <b>homework</b> and <b>homework</b> practices, and the teacher-in-action in situ <b>homework</b> practices used by classroom teachers. It was found that the use of SR methods to explore teacher-in-action practices was problematic and difficult to manage in the classroom setting. However, the results using this methodology confirmed that teacher perspectives were enacted into teacher-inaction practice. The results also revealed that teacher perspectives about the purpose for <b>homework</b> influenced the types of <b>homework</b> used and the ways in which primary classroom teachers implemented <b>homework</b> using idiosyncratic teacher <b>homework</b> practices. The results from this research have been used to develop a reflective frame for teacher <b>homework</b> practice. This frame can be used by educators, and in particular by classroom teachers to  raise awareness about teacher <b>homework</b> practice; and  stimulate professional discussions about <b>homework</b> and teacher <b>homework</b> practice...|$|R

50|$|The {{occasion}} of the book was the birth of fewer children, economically {{and in terms of}} unsustainable housing for families. The authors proposed intelligent natalism in which families with children should be supported by various reforms such as free medical care, free school lunches, child benefit, more and better housing, affordable housing and subsidized rent. The idea was that both parents could work outside the home and that the prevailing patriarchal family system (professionals father, <b>homeworking</b> mother) must be revised substantially through a program of social engineering. If children were placed in some kind of institution with trained staff while parents work, that would have a positive economic impact as well as educational benefits to each individual child.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{findings and}} analysis {{based upon the}} third wave of a national longitudinal survey in the UK which is examining part-day <b>homeworking</b> and comparing it with whole day <b>homeworking.</b> Survey results confirm earlier findings {{that there is a}} higher incidence, amongst full-time paid employees, of part-day <b>homeworking</b> than whole-day <b>homeworking.</b> The paper then separately examines determinants of the desire to part-day homework and whole day homework and determinants of the reported frequency of part-day <b>homeworking</b> and whole day <b>homeworking.</b> The determinants considered are socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents and belief statements relating to <b>homeworking.</b> Four statements are found to be relevant to desire to part-day and to whole-day homework: avoiding interruptions at work; avoiding wasted time in traffic; other household members appreciating the employee homeworking; and working longer hours. A similar comparison concerning actual frequency of <b>homeworking</b> finds that employer support is relevant for both <b>homeworking</b> practices, with part-day <b>homeworking</b> being associated with avoiding interruptions at work and whole day <b>homeworking</b> frequency also being associated with commute struggle. For both forms of working practice, the belief statements are better able to explain desire to homework (more) than to explain frequency of <b>homeworking.</b> This is perhaps not surprising given the variability of work patterns {{at the level of the}} individual that can occur from week-to-week. The better performance of desire models for whole day <b>homeworking</b> compared to those for part-day <b>homeworking</b> suggest that other factors are at play that remain to be identified in future examination of part-day <b>homeworking...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} {{and quality of}} <b>homework</b> has been a topic of much discussion for decades. This dissertation therefore analyzes the relationship between <b>homework</b> and achievement {{in a series of}} empirical studies. One main area of interest was the relationship between <b>homework</b> time and achievement. Although the “homework time” variable has long been a focus of scientific interest, the strength of its association with achievement is not yet entirely clear. A second main area of interest was the role of <b>homework</b> quality. Building on the <b>homework</b> model proposed by Trautwein and colleagues (Trautwein, Lüdtke, Kastens, & Köller, 2006; Trautwein, Lüdtke, Schnyder, & Niggli, 2006), it was proposed that <b>homework</b> quality (i. e., well prepared and adequately challenging assignments) is one of the variables impacting <b>homework</b> motivation, <b>homework</b> behavior, and achievement. As a third main area of interest, the <b>homework</b> model was extended to include the experience of <b>homework</b> emotions. It was proposed that <b>homework</b> quality influences the experience of <b>homework</b> emotions and that <b>homework</b> emotions are associated with <b>homework</b> effort and achievement. All research questions were analyzed using multilevel modeling. The dissertation contains four empirical studies. The first study examined the relationship between <b>homework</b> time and achievement in 40 countries. Using multilevel modeling, the study confirmed <b>homework</b> time to be variable that requires a multilevel approach. Moreover, differential results for the relationship between <b>homework</b> time and achievement were found at different levels of analyses. At the school level, <b>homework</b> time was found to be positively associated with mathematics achievement in most countries. At the student level, however, differential associations were found between the two variables. Moreover, the analyses highlighted the need to control for confounding variables. The second study analyzed the role of <b>homework</b> quality for <b>homework</b> motivation, <b>homework</b> effort, and mathematics achievement. Meaningful associations emerged between two <b>homework</b> quality indicators and the outcome variables. Specifically, the study provided first evidence for a positive relationship between high-quality <b>homework</b> selection and mathematics achievement at the class level. Moreover, it revealed differential effects for <b>homework</b> challenge at the student and the class level. Students in classes with higher average perceptions of <b>homework</b> challenge showed greater achievement gains than students in other classes, even when prior knowledge was controlled. However, there was a negative relationship between the two variables at the student level, indicating that students who report high levels of <b>homework</b> challenge relative their classmates may feel overtaxed by their <b>homework</b> assignments and thus exhibit less favorable outcomes. The third study analyzed how characteristics of the learning environment influence <b>homework</b> effort and achievement. The study aimed at replicating the results of the second study in a sample of older students and with two further indicators of the learning environment: <b>homework</b> control and assignment of individualized <b>homework.</b> Multilevel modeling demonstrated a positive relationship between <b>homework</b> selection and achievement and a negative relationship between <b>homework</b> challenge and achievement at the student level. Moreover, <b>homework</b> control was positively associated with <b>homework</b> behavior and negatively associated with mathematics achievement. Finally, assignment of individualized <b>homework</b> was negatively related to mathematics achievement. The fourth study analyzed the antecedents and consequences of <b>homework</b> emotions. Multilevel modeling revealed <b>homework</b> quality to predict the experience of enjoyment and boredom. Furthermore, the study provided insights into the role of negative <b>homework</b> emotions in mathematics achievement. Specifically students who experienced negative <b>homework</b> emotions reported less <b>homework</b> effort and performed lower on a mathematics achievement test than their counterparts...|$|R

The <b>Homework</b> Motivation and Preference Questionnaire was utilized to assess students 2 ̆ 7 <b>homework</b> behaviors, and a multiple regression approach was employed to determine whether students 2 ̆ 7 <b>homework</b> motivation and preferences predict <b>homework</b> achievement and attitude, while controlling {{for the effects of}} gender and socioeconomic status. <b>Homework</b> self-motivation, organization (order), sound, and interpersonal preference (studying alone) have relatively strong and consistent relationships with <b>homework</b> achievement and attitudes toward <b>homework.</b> However, other organizational (place), perceptual (tactile), and physical (intake) preferences, and other motivational sources (parent- and teacher-motivated), are related to attitudes toward <b>homework</b> more so than perceived <b>homework</b> achievement.

40|$|<b>Homework</b> time (i. e., {{the total}} amount of time spent on <b>homework)</b> and <b>homework</b> effort (i. e., the extent to which {{students}} work seriously on their <b>homework)</b> are defined as two central aspects that characterize students’ <b>homework</b> behavior. Recent research has identified <b>homework</b> learning types by considering differences in students in both <b>homework</b> effort and <b>homework</b> time with a person-centered approach (Flunger et al., 2015). The present study investigated how students’ characteristics (i. e., motivation, conscientiousness, gender, and verbal abilities) are associated with these <b>homework</b> behavior profiles. To this end, data on <b>homework</b> behavior in the subject of French as a second language of 1649 Swiss eighth-grade students were reanalyzed by applying latent profile analyses (LPAs) with covariates in a modified three-step method (Vermunt, 2010). The findings suggest that large amounts of <b>homework</b> time can be a characteristic of favorable <b>homework</b> behavior: When students simultaneously invested a great deal of effort in their <b>homework,</b> {{spending a lot of time}} on <b>homework</b> was associated with high motivation and high conscientiousness. By contrast, when students exerted low effort, large amounts of <b>homework</b> time were found to be associated with low motivation and low conscientiousness...|$|R

40|$|Although past {{research}} suggests that life stage is an important consideration in the work-life interface, a life stage approach in the work-life literature is uncommon and mostly focused {{on the negative side}} (work-life conflict) of the interface. Accordingly, this dissertation presents a quantitative study (N= 507) that integrates conflict and enrichment into work-life balance by life stage. Drawing on work-life theories (e. g., role scarcity) and life course research, it extends extant knowledge by confirming that work-life balance differs by life stage but not as expected. Employees in the early life stage (rather than those in later stages) had the most beneficial work-life balance. Understanding work-life balance differences by life stage may also help organisations to craft more targeted policies and practices for their employees. This dissertation examines further work-life issues by focusing on the effects of <b>homeworking.</b> It includes a qualitative study (N= 40), supported by quantitative data (N= 514), that explores the situation when <b>homeworking</b> is perceived differently by the employee and the employer. Based on Employee-Organisation Relationship (EOR) concepts (such as Perceived Organisational Support) and an extension of an inducements-contributions model, this dissertation contributes to the EOR literature by integrating employee and employer's perspectives and suggesting that differences in perceptions may produce adverse outcomes, such as employees not meeting their employer's expected contribution. This thesis also explores the role of <b>homeworking</b> in the organisational culture-climate alignment using a multi-model framework of organisational culture-climate. It provides a detailed contextual explanation of the potential adverse impact of <b>homeworking</b> on the organisation with a mixed methods approach. Findings reveal that <b>homeworking</b> may cause tension in the cultureclimate relationship and negatively affect organisational performance. These results contribute to the organisational culture and climate literature and the on-going debate over the consequences of <b>homeworking,</b> and provide a practical illustration of homeworking’s potential drawbacks...|$|E

The crucial reason for this case study came {{as a result of}} a study that concluded Malaysian students spend a lot of time completing <b>homework</b> as compared to other countries. Hence, the Education Ministry pioneered <b>homework</b> circular to provide guidelines to <b>homework</b> implementation for all schools. The case study was conducted in an urban primary school to investigate the current <b>homework</b> practices and implementation in this school. The aims of this case study was to look and to examine the real situation of <b>homework</b> implementation in schools in terms of the level of adherence prior to the circular <b>homework</b> and after the circular had been disseminated as stipulated by the Ministry of Education, 2004. In addition, the case study investigated what were the students’ and teachers’ opinion of <b>homework.</b> The objective of this case study was to look at the current <b>homework</b> practices and implementation in the areas of roles of teachers, types of <b>homework,</b> amount of <b>homework,</b> time spent on <b>homework,</b> and punishment. It was also to find out the students responses about <b>homework</b> in the areas of role of the family, <b>homework</b> problem, value of <b>homework,</b> difficulty of <b>homework,</b> <b>homework</b> completion and home environment. The research instruments used for data collection were survey questionnaire and interview sessions with students and teachers. The findings of the study reported that the school and teacher had adhered to the implementation of <b>homework</b> circular. Secondly, students were keen to do <b>homework</b> and were highly motivated to complete <b>homework.</b> Even if they did not understand the exact function of <b>homework</b> but students believed that <b>homework</b> made them smarter; learn good study habits and made them prepare for tests and examination. In light of the findings all stakeholders involved could perhaps plan an effective way on how to enhance the interest of students and parents to become actively involved and facilitate their child in <b>homework</b> problems.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. This study examined {{the ways in which}} home is conceptualised, experienced and evaluated by homeworkers, a hard-to-reach group. It explored the impact of <b>homeworking</b> on the experience of home and family life and sought to identify ways in which working from home may challenge the traditional stereotypical view of home. A pilot study suggested that the <b>homeworking</b> experience may be differentiated by economic, spatial and gender factors revealing potential tensions and inequalities among the broad range of people who work from home. The research sought to: explore the existence of supports, inequalities and tensions in the <b>homeworking</b> experience; and establish the particular qualities of home that are enhanced with working from home, as well as those that are limited by this activity. The study used mixed methods, including face-to-face qualitative interviews with individuals and focus groups, and a semi-structured questionnaire, from which a quantitative data file was complied. The qualitative sample consisted of 60 men and women who worked from home (45 individual interviewees, and fifteen other respondents comprising three focus groups), in varied types of work including professional, semi-skilled and unskilled. Four population areas in Northern England and Wales were targeted for this study. The quantitative data set included 62 questionnaires from a separate sample of national homeworkers. Key findings suggest that <b>homeworking</b> is differentiated by gender role, type of work and expectations. Furthermore there are both positive and negative aspects to the <b>homeworking</b> experience for all homeworkers. For example, flexibility is desired and enjoyed but this brings longer working hours. Finally, home is enhanced for some and invaded for others, but most make a conscious effort to make working from home viable. Main Topics : The qualitative interviews cover paid work done at home, how the interviewee began <b>homeworking,</b> location in the home used for work, how family/partner copes with interviewee's home work, enjoyment of <b>homeworking,</b> choice of other jobs outside the home, positive and negative aspects of <b>homeworking,</b> perception of how treated in comparison to other workers, structure of typical working day, separation of work and home life, leisure time activities, breaks from work, local neighbourhood, perceptions of home and changes brought on by working from home. Variables in the quantitative data file include interviewee number (the 45 interviews may be linked by number to the respondent information in the data file), age, gender, rural/urban location, type of work, employment status, employment details and sector, hours of work, employment and <b>homeworking</b> history, living arrangements and household, children and childcare, computer use, community access, ways of working from home, comparison with other ways of working and work locus of control.

40|$|Changes in {{the nature}} of work e. g. Location Independent Working and the growth of <b>homeworking,</b> mean that {{managers}} and their staff may not work in close proximity and so rarely meet in person. The consequent loss of visibility and physical presence creates specific challenges and constraints in relation to the managers' role in the employment relationship. As previous research has compartmentalised the perspectives of homeworkers and their managers, analysis has always been restrictive, lacking in an all-encompassing view of the employment relationship. Seeking to address this disparity, this research assesses the views of both sides of the employment relationship, thereby exploring the experiences of managers and homeworkers. Using contrasting organisations, this research explores how the practice of management control differs in a <b>homeworking</b> environment. The case study organisations suggest that job role, skill level and organisational size can influence a line manager’s ability to exercise control. Direct control is possible for organisations employing low skilled workers undertaking repetitive tasks. Close electronic monitoring of performance stimulates a cyclical process of resistance and increased management surveillance. For an organisation employing highly skilled autonomous workers, direct control is problematic. Managers become increasingly reliant on external proxies of performance. The objectivity of these external measures is questionable, which consequently reduces the manager’s ability to control performance. As a limited amount of research has investigated the practicalities of managing homeworkers, this research is unique as it has explored the influence of <b>homeworking</b> on a manager’s ability to exercise control. Consequently, these findings will offer new insights into the practice of management control in a <b>homeworking</b> environment. As these findings have uncovered some of the specific challenges of <b>homeworking</b> from a managers and homeworkers perspective, the practicalities of managing homeworkers and the potential advantages and drawbacks of working at home may now be more readily understood.

40|$|Background. The {{majority}} {{of mental health}} clinicians report the use of <b>homework</b> to support their case management, but practitioner surveys indicate that <b>homework</b> is not routinely used. Aims. To examine barriers that mental health case managers experience in implementing <b>homework</b> and to identify strategies to promote successful <b>homework</b> administration. Method. One hundred thirty-four surveys were completed by mental health case managers. The survey examined their use of <b>homework</b> for individuals diagnosed with a severe mental health problem. It also asked them to identify barriers to regularly implement <b>homework</b> and describe strategies to promote more regular use of <b>homework.</b> Results. On average, <b>homework</b> was used at 50 % of clinical contacts. The primary reasons for not using <b>homework</b> included allocating insufficient time at appointments, perceived client resistance for using <b>homework</b> and concerns that the client was too unwell. Strategies used to overcome these difficulties included prioritising the use of <b>homework</b> and ensuring that <b>homework</b> assignments were achievable. Conclusions.

40|$|The {{therapeutic}} use of <b>homework</b> assignments {{is an integral}} feature of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) and {{is believed to be}} important in producing and maintaining client treatment gains. While there is empirical and theoretical support suggesting that <b>homework</b> completion may be associated with improved outcome, few studies have directly investigated specific therapist behaviours used in the integration of <b>homework</b> into practice. Similarly, research on client <b>homework</b> completion has, by far, focused solely on the quantity of <b>homework</b> completion rather than on any other factors found to be associated with increased client engagement with <b>homework</b> assignments. The recently developed <b>Homework</b> Adherence and Competence Scale (HAACS) was designed to specifically assess therapist competence and adherence to recommended <b>homework</b> behaviours used to administer <b>homework.</b> As a new measure of client <b>homework</b> completion, the <b>Homework</b> Rating Scale-II (HRS-II), extends the assessment of client <b>homework</b> completion beyond quantity only and provides a measure of the cognitive and behavioural determinants of client <b>homework</b> completion.

At the class level, achievement was higher in classes set frequent <b>homework</b> assignments and in classes where students reported low overall levels of negative emotions when doing <b>homework.</b> At the between-student level, high <b>homework</b> effort and low levels of negative <b>homework</b> emotions predicted favorable developments in French achievement, whereas high <b>homework</b> time predicted lower achievement. At the intraindividual level, high <b>homework</b> effort, high <b>homework</b> time, and low levels of negative <b>homework</b> emotions were statistically significantly associated with positive student evaluations of the specific assignment...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the impact of}} flexible working arrangements (FWAs), using the British Household Panel Survey and Understanding Society, 2001 - 2010 / 11. Results of panel logit, ANCOVA and change-score analysis are indicative of positive impacts from use {{of a number of}} FWAs, including <b>homeworking</b> having positive effects for men and women on job and leisure satisfaction. However, findings reveal gaps in availability and use of FWAs, and highlight the gendered nature of flexible employment. Flexi-time, the most common FWA among men, has positive effects as it facilitates management of household responsibilities while maintaining full-time employment. Part-time and <b>homeworking</b> are also positive, consistent with men using FWAs with a greater degree of choice. Women more often are constrained in their use of FWAs, often into working reduced hours. Consequently, FWAs have negative impacts for some women, on job (part-time when used for extended periods, flexi-time), leisure (job-share, flexi-time), and life satisfaction (job-share) ...|$|E
40|$|As {{a result}} of past débates {{on the concept of}} legal subordination, in France, <b>homeworking</b> has long been {{considered}} the equivalent of wage-earning. However, homeworkers, mostly women, endure relatively poor conditions compared with other wage-earners. These problems are further exasperated by improvements in information and communications technology, {{due to the fact that}} homework in an irregular occupation, performed on peicework and without social links. ...|$|E

Weaknesses and gains of these constructs are analyzed to bring an objective view of modern work-methods. The work also presents the basic technologies, that relate to working from remote places. In addition are also included various specific methods of home-earning in the theme...|$|E
40|$|Though it is {{generally}} believed that doing <b>homework</b> promotes better learning, no consensus has been achieved concerning its importance and relevance to students' achievement. The historical up-and-down status of public attitudes toward <b>homework</b> indicates that understanding {{about the role of}} <b>homework</b> in students' learning is far from comprehensive and clear. The literature shows that much research effort has been devoted to the relationship between amount of <b>homework</b> and achievement, but little on quality of <b>homework</b> and how it has been used. Applying a 2 -level hierarchical linear model on the TIMSS 2003 data, this study investigated the relationship between classroom practices on <b>homework</b> and 8 th grade students' mathematics achievement in Hong Kong in three dimensions: frequency and amount of <b>homework,</b> types of <b>homework,</b> and usage modes of <b>homework.</b> The results showed that while the time spent on daily mathematics <b>homework</b> had significantly positive effect on students' TIMSS results, no effect was observed on the frequency of <b>homework</b> assigned. Out of three types of <b>homework,</b> only <b>homework</b> of the problem/question type demonstrated significant effect. The practice of having students start <b>homework</b> in class had negative influence on students' learning outcome. Implications and suggestions for educational practice and future research were then discussed. © 2011 National Science Council, Taiwan. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} <b>homework</b> {{policy as}} a product of 50 years of experimental research. Part 1 discusses <b>homework</b> guidelines in grades 3 through 8 by suggesting that <b>homework</b> should be assigned, graded, and individualized. In addition, <b>homework</b> should provide feedback about student achievement that includes parental monitoring. Part 2 recommends secondary school <b>homework</b> policies that Include clear and concise graded assignments. Furthermore, the proposal tnat some <b>homework</b> be guided, voluntary, and nonwritten reflects outcomes of <b>homework</b> research in American education. The conclusion that the assigning of <b>homework</b> should follow a regular pattern aligned with classroom subject matter supports the notion that <b>homework</b> reinforces learning, thereby raising student achievement. Moreover, school districts should support <b>homework</b> policies that research findings link to raising student achievement.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} whether online <b>homework</b> benefits students over traditional <b>homework</b> in the areas of statistics self-efficacy, statistics anxiety, and grades.   Using a nonequivalent control-group design, one section of students was assigned traditional <b>homework</b> while the other section was assigned online <b>homework.</b>   The two groups were then compared on measures of self-efficacy, statistics anxiety, and <b>homework,</b> test, and final grades. Results indicated that <b>homework</b> delivery method affected only student <b>homework</b> grades, but did not affect their other grades, self-efficacy, or anxiety...|$|R
