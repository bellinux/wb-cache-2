25|$|Hochschild {{cites the}} {{research}} of several historians, many of them Belgian. He refers especially to Jules Marchal, formerly a Belgian colonial civil servant and diplomat who (as Hochschild describes) spent twenty years trying to break Belgian silence about the massacres. The documentation was not <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> by; the furnaces of the palace in Brussels {{are said to have}} spent more than a week burning incriminating papers before Leopold turned over his private Congo to the Belgian nation. For many years Belgian authorities prevented access to what remained of the archives, notably the accounts given by Congolese to the King's Commission.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{it grows}} {{in parts of}} California, Nevada, Arizona, Texas and Florida, the entire Mediterranean coast of Spain (very {{noticeable}} in the Valencian community, Balearic Islands and Andalusia. Very huge jacarandas {{can be found in}} Valencia, Alicante or Seville, and usually with earlier flowering than in the rest of Europe in the latter), in southern Portugal (very noticeably in Lisbon), southern Italy (in Naples and Cagliari it's quite <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> across beautiful specimens), southern Greece (noticeable in Athens) and on the Islands of Malta and Cyprus. It was introduced to Cape Town by Baron von Ludwig in about 1829. It is regarded as an invasive species in parts of South Africa and Queensland, Australia, the latter of which has had problems with the Blue Jacaranda preventing growth of native species. Lusaka, the capital of Zambia, and Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, also see the growth of many jacarandas.|$|E

[...] In 2014, McAvoy acknowledged that a potential sequel has been in the talks, saying he [...] "had a couple of versions of script thrown my way" [...] while adding that Universal is still waiting for the right screenplay.|$|E

2500|$|Ford also {{believed}} in using clean and readily-available sources of power. [...] Water power, he thought, was nearly inexhaustible and <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> by in Michigan. [...] He {{had in fact}} begun experimenting with water power when building his house at Fair Lane. [...] Thus, the village industry plants all made use of hydroelectric power; indeed, many were located {{at the site of}} old mills. [...] Some of the village industry plants actually utilize refurbished grist mill buildings, others merely used the site, with Ford erecting new industrial buildings to house the plant.|$|E
2500|$|S. c. catenatus {{is rather}} shy and avoids humans when it can. [...] Most massasauga snakebites in Ontario have {{occurred}} after people deliberately handled or accidentally stepped {{on one of}} these animals. [...] Both of these scenarios are preventable by avoiding hiking through areas of low visibility (in rattlesnake country) when not wearing shoes and long pants, and by leaving the massasaugas alone when they are found. [...] There are only two recorded incidents of people dying from massasauga rattlesnake bites in Ontario and in both cases they did not receive proper treatment. Recent studies indicate that Ontario hospitals in rattlesnake country often do not have anti-venom, as massasauga specific anti-venom is not <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> by.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the time}} of Julia's birth, 39 BC, Augustus had not yet {{received}} the title [...] "Augustus" [...] and was known as [...] "Gaius Julius Caesar Divi Filius," [...] though historians refer to him as [...] "Octavian" [...] until [...] 27 BC, when Julia was 11. Octavian divorced Julia's mother {{the day of her}} birth and took Julia from her soon thereafter. Octavian, in accordance with Roman custom, claimed complete parental control over her. She was sent to live with her stepmother Livia when she was old enough and learn how to be an aristocrat. Her education appears to have been strict and somewhat old-fashioned. Thus, in addition to her studies, Suetonius informs us, she was taught spinning and weaving. Macrobius mentions [...] "her love of literature and considerable culture, a thing <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> by in that household".|$|E
2500|$|Colonizing Mercury {{would involve}} similar {{challenges}} as the Moon {{as there are}} few volatile elements, no atmosphere and the surface gravity is lower than Earth's. However, the planet also receives almost seven times the solar flux as the Earth/Moon system. [...] Geologist Stephen Gillett has suggested this will make Mercury an ideal place to build solar sails, which could launch as folded up [...] "chunks" [...] by mass driver from Mercury's surface. [...] Once in space the solar sails would deploy. Since Mercury's solar constant is 6.5 times higher than Earth's, energy for the mass driver should be <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> by, and solar sails near Mercury would have 6.5 times the thrust they do near Earth. This could make Mercury an ideal place to acquire materials useful in building hardware to send to (and terraform) Venus. Vast solar collectors could also be built on or near Mercury to produce power for large scale engineering activities such as laser-pushed lightsails to nearby star systems.|$|E
2500|$|The {{interpreter}} of the Lewis and Clark Expedition mistakenly identified this people as the Nez Perce {{when the team}} encountered the tribe in 1805. [...] Writing in 1889, anthropologist Alice Fletcher, who the U.S. government had sent to Idaho to allot the Nez Perce Reservation, explained the mistaken naming. [...] She wrote, [...] "It is never <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> at {{the name of an}} Indian or even of an Indian tribe. A tribe has always at least two names; one they call themselves by and one by which they are known to other tribes. All the tribes living west of the Rocky Mountains were called [...] "Chupnit-pa-lu," [...] which means people of the pierced noses; it also means emerging from the bushes or forest; the people from the woods. [...] The tribes on the Columbia river used to pierce the nose and wear in it some ornament as you have seen some old fashioned white ladies wear in their ears. Lewis and Clark had with them an interpreter whose wife was a Shoshone or Snake woman and so it came about that when it was asked [...] "What Indians are these?" [...] the answer was [...] "They are 'Chupnit-pa-lu'" [...] and it was written down in the journal; spelled rather queerly, for white people's ears do not always catch Indian tones and of course the Indians could not spell any word." ...|$|E

2500|$|The match {{scheduled}} {{to be held in}} Melbourne was held almost two weeks after the second test in Sydney, was held and the Indians had already shown some fight in the second match and so they did in the third, albeit in the first innings only. The match started off with the Australians winning the toss and choosing to bat first. Immediately, the Indians got a breakthrough in the form of Barnes' wicket, bowled by Mankad with the score on 29. Then, Arthur Morris, and Don Bradman staged a fightback by stitching together a 70-run partnership, before Morris was bowled by Amarnath for a patient 45 crafted from 123 balls with three fours. Lindsay Hassett entered the fray with the score poised on 99, with his captain, Bradman batting. Hassett was dropped in the slips off Vijay Hazare's bowling when he was batting on 31. This lapse proved too costly for the Indians, because Hassett and Bradman staged a counterattack on the Indian bowlers with some fast scoring, Wisden's own words, Hassett was [...] "scored as fast as his partner", and that, [...] "...at times runs came at two a minute". Hassett's was the third wicket to fall, with the scorecard reading 268, gifting Mankad his second scalp. Then Bradman fell to Phadkar, for 132 scored only off 204 balls at a strike-rate excess of 60. After his dismissal, the wickets were <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> by, with the last six falling for a mere 105.|$|E

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of the “feminization of migration” in the Asian region is drawing attention. In the past, women’s migration in Western regions was mainly a family migration and one of women following their husbands. By contrast, women’s migration in the Asian region {{can be characterized as}} an individual migration. The emigration of Korean women that started from the late 1970 s can be understood in the same context, as the phenomena of the “feminization of migration” and “feminization of survival. ” New opportunities for women to move from Korea to Japan specifically may be described as the {{phenomenon of}} “cultural escape/refuge. ” Korean women find it <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Japan because of the social networks that exist between Korea and Japan...|$|R
