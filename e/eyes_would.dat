5|$|CGI {{special effects}} {{for the series}} were {{provided}} by The Mill. The production team wanted a talking dragon, but {{they were worried about}} the lip sync and did not think it would be believable until they saw the first test. The Mill created a software that would read Hurt's facial muscles and incorporated it into the animation. Another concern was that the <b>eyes</b> <b>would</b> not convey the character, but this was corrected by the final version. Additional sound effects, such as the clanging chain, were added to give the creature weight. The knife Mary throws at Arthur was also completely CGI, though the shot of it hitting the chair was real.|$|E

5|$|Other {{evidence}} suggests hunting behavior in Tyrannosaurus. The eye-sockets of tyrannosaurs are positioned {{so that the}} <b>eyes</b> <b>would</b> point forward, giving them binocular vision slightly better than that of modern hawks. Tyrannosaur-inflicted damage has been found on skeletons of hadrosaurs and Triceratops {{that seemed to have}} survived initial attacks. Some researchers argue that if Tyrannosaurus were a scavenger, another dinosaur had to be the top predator in the Amerasian Upper Cretaceous. The top prey were the larger marginocephalians and ornithopods. The other tyrannosaurids share so many characteristics with Tyrannosaurus that only small dromaeosaurs remain as feasible top predators. In this light, scavenger hypothesis adherents have suggested that the size and power of tyrannosaurs allowed them to steal kills from smaller predators. Most paleontologists accept that Tyrannosaurus was an active predator that was willing to scavenge if it could.|$|E

5|$|The eye-sockets of Tyrannosaurus are {{positioned}} {{so that the}} <b>eyes</b> <b>would</b> point forward, giving them binocular vision slightly better than that of modern hawks. While predatory theropods in general had binocular vision {{directly in front of}} their skull, tyrannosaurs had a significantly larger area of overlap. Jack Horner also pointed out that the tyrannosaur lineage had a history of steadily improving binocular vision. It {{is hard to see how}} natural selection would have favored this long-term trend if tyrannosaurs had been pure scavengers, which would not have needed the advanced depth perception that stereoscopic vision provides. In modern animals, binocular vision is found mainly in predators (the principal exceptions are primates, which need it for leaping from branch to branch). Unlike Tyrannosaurus, Tarbosaurus had a narrower skull more typical of other tyrannosaurids in which the eyes faced primarily sideways. All of this suggests that Tarbosaurus relied more on its senses of smell and hearing than on its eyesight. In Gorgosaurus specimens, the eye socket was circular rather than oval or keyhole-shaped as in other tyrannosaurid genera. In Daspletosaurus, this was a tall oval, somewhere in between the circular shape seen in Gorgosaurus and the 'keyhole' shape of Tyrannosaurus.|$|E

25|$|A 1989 USMC {{study found}} that single-seat fighters were well suited to air-to-air combat {{missions}} while dual-seat fighters were favored for complex strike missions against heavy air and ground defenses in adverse weather—the question being {{not so much as}} to whether a second pair of <b>eyes</b> <b>would</b> be useful, but as to having the second crewman sit in the same fighter or in a second fighter.

25|$|Additional {{evidence}} {{is provided by}} the eyes of ichthyosaurs that among vertebrates are both relatively and absolutely the largest known. Modern Leopard seals can dive to up to one kilometre hunting on sight. Motani suggested that ichthyosaurs, with their relatively much larger eye sockets, {{should have been able to}} reach even greater depths. Temnodontosaurus, with eyes that had a diameter of twenty-five centimetres, could probably still see at a depth of 1600 meters. At these depths, such <b>eyes</b> <b>would</b> have been especially useful to see large objects. Later species, such as Ophthalmosaurus, had relatively larger eyes, again an indication that diving capacity was better in late Jurassic and Cretaceous forms.|$|E
25|$|Operation Snake Eyes was a {{proposed}} military {{operation of the}} Laotian Civil War. Planned in mid-December 1969 by the U.S. Ambassador to Laos, the planned interdiction of the newly constructed Chinese Road, Route 46, was aimed at halting the road's progress toward the border with Thailand. The offensive by guerrilla raiders was delayed six months for operational reasons. When it was finally ready to be launched, it was pre-empted by the furor caused by the Cambodian Incursion. Fearful that Operation Snake <b>Eyes</b> <b>would</b> arouse even greater publicity, the Central Intelligence Agency handlers of the guerrillas canceled the operation on orders of the White House. Attempts to limit Chinese expansion toward the south would be left to future operations, such as Operation Phalat and Operation Sourisak Montry.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{remarkable}} findings in the tunnel chambers was a miniature mountainous landscape, 17 metres underground, with tiny pools of liquid mercury representing lakes. The walls and ceiling of the tunnel were found to have been carefully impregnated with mineral powder composed of magnetite, pyrite known as fool's gold and hematite, providing a special brightness to the place and to give the effect of standing under the stars as a peculiar re-creation of the underworld. At the end of the passage Gómez Chávez’s team uncovered four greenstone statues, wearing garments and beads, and their open <b>eyes</b> <b>would</b> have shone with precious minerals. Two of the figurines were still in their original positions, leaning back and apparently contemplating up at the axis where the three planes of the universe meet - probably the founding shamans of Teotihuacan, guiding pilgrims to the sanctuary, and carrying bundles of sacred objects used to perform rituals, including pendants and pyrite mirrors, which were perceived as portals to other realms.|$|E
25|$|In the movie, Snake Eyes' origin is rebooted, {{with him}} being an {{abandoned}} 10-year-old child who {{found his way}} to the home of Arashikage Clan. He battles the young Thomas Arashikage (Storm Shadow), who attacks him for stealing food. However, the orphan's natural ability to fight impresses Thomas's uncle, the Hard Master, who gives Snake Eyes his name, while bringing him under his wing. While Snake <b>Eyes</b> <b>would</b> initially lose to Thomas, Snake Eyes eventually surpasses Thomas and gains the favor of the Hard Master, becoming recognized as Hard Master's top student. Angered at Hard Master choosing Snake Eyes over him, Thomas appears to kill the Hard Master off-screen, and is then seen running off in midst of the chaos. Since then, Snake Eyes has chosen to take a vow of silence. Learning that Thomas, now known as Storm Shadow, is a member of Cobra, Snake Eyes fights him, before stabbing him and allowing him to fall into icy water at Cobra's Arctic base, leaving him for dead. Snake Eyes returns to The Pit with the surviving members of G.I. Joe.|$|E
25|$|After {{two years}} at Alma College, Hull moved to Hibbing, Minnesota to work as an {{apprentice}} mining engineer. However, after two months he was afflicted by polio, which left him paralyzed with one leg, causing him to recover at his parents home {{for a year and}} forcing him to reconsider his life path. He considered becoming a minister of Unitarianism, because he found their philosophy focused sermons appealing. His love of philosophy eventually led to his interest in Psychology, which he studied during his recovery. He began his journey by reading William James’ book Principles of Psychology. He also took a particular interest in the works of Watson and Pavlov. A little after he started reading, his <b>eyes</b> <b>would</b> become weak and his mother would read to him until his eyes became strong enough for him to read on his own. A year later, he decided to teach back home in the one room school, which had expanded to two-rooms. After his two years teaching, he married Bertha Iutzi with very little money.|$|E
50|$|Louis Ducos du Hauron {{produced}} the first printed anaglyphs in 1891. This process consisted of printing the two negatives which form a stereoscopic photograph {{on to the}} same paper, one in blue (or green), one in red. The viewer would then use coloured glasses with red (for the left eye) and blue or green (right eye). The left <b>eye</b> <b>would</b> see the blue image which would appear black, whilst it would not see the red; similarly the right <b>eye</b> <b>would</b> see the red image, this registering as black. Thus a three dimensional image would result.|$|R

50|$|The {{primary mission}} of Sky Eye is for {{reconnaissance}} and targeting. As the artillery or rocket round reached the designated target area with Sky Eye as payload, Sky <b>Eye</b> <b>would</b> {{separate from the}} round and drag chute would be deployed to reduce the speed so to the point it is slow enough to deploy the rotors. Once Sky Eye is airborne with its own power, the UAV would begin its search of target such as vehicles or bunkers via onboard camera, and once the target is identified, it would be illuminated by laser. Sky <b>Eye</b> <b>would</b> continue to illuminate the target with laser until the target is destroyed by semi-active laser (SAL) guided missile. After the target is destroyed, Sky <b>Eye</b> <b>would</b> search for the next target and repeat the process again. When the battery is finally out, Sky <b>Eye</b> <b>would</b> self-destruct. Sky <b>Eye</b> gun-launched UAV is offered as a cheaper alternative to much more expensive missiles with search-and-destroy capability, such as Northrop Grumman Brilliant Anti-Tank missile (BAT) because Sky Eye can loiter longer on the battlefield, unlike BAT, which is only good for a short span of flying time, and can only be used once. With Sky Eye, one UAV can provide targeting service for several missiles, so these missiles need {{not have to be}} equipped with expensive targeting system of their own. Furthermore, the SAL guided missile itself is much cheaper than imaging infrared guided missiles such as BAT.|$|R

500|$|Caribbean reef {{sharks are}} {{sometimes}} seen resting motionless {{on the sea}} floor or inside caves; {{it is the first}} active shark species in which such a behavior was reported. In 1975, Eugenie Clark investigated the famed [...] "sleeping sharks" [...] inside the caves at Isla Mujeres off the Yucatan Peninsula, and determined that the sharks were not actually asleep as their <b>eyes</b> <b>would</b> follow divers. Clark speculated that freshwater upwellings inside the caves might loosen parasites on the sharks and produce an enjoyable [...] "narcotic" [...] effect. If threatened, Caribbean reef sharks sometimes perform a threat display, in which they swim in a short, jerky fashion with frequent changes in direction and repeated, brief (11.2 second duration) drops of the pectoral fins. This display is less pronounced than the better-known display of the grey reef shark (C. amblyrhynchos).|$|E
500|$|Producer Nik Korda noted how helpful {{it was to}} have Sean Gunn and Krystian Godlewski portray Rocket and Groot on set, as it {{provided}} references for lighting and on-set performances to the animators. When creating Groot, MPC realized early on that his <b>eyes</b> <b>would</b> be essential in maintaining the character's human qualities, as his face couldn't move in the way that humans' do. MPC visual effects supervisor Nicolas Aithadi explained that, [...] "When you look at humans what makes the eyes interesting is the imperfections – trying to make these two irises not aimed at the same place – trying to make them strange and look more human." [...] Textures for Groot came from a number of sources, including inspiration from a botanical garden in London, and the character was modeled as individual branches, rigged individually, to simulate a muscle system for the character.|$|E

500|$|Hogarth chose a {{more serious}} topic for Grosvenor's painting. [...] He {{is said to have}} painted Sigismunda {{mourning}} over the Heart of Guiscardo with the aim of proving that he could equal works of the [...] "Old Italian Masters", and intending the painting to be one of his masterpieces. In the leg of the table in the painting, a turbaned, pug-nosed figure is carved, emerging from the ornate decoration, which is reminiscent of Hogarth's self-portrait The Artist Painting the Comic Muse from around 1757, and is perhaps Hogarth's attempt to insert himself bodily into the picture, thereby making an overt connection between himself and the Old Masters. In 1758, Sir Thomas Sebright, 5th Baronet had paid £405.5s in an Old Master auction for a painting of Sigismunda supposedly by Correggio. Hogarth doubted the attribution and was later proved correct: the painting is now considered to be by Francesco Furini. Nevertheless, Hogarth priced his Sigismunda in line with what was paid for the [...] "Correggio" [...] version and commensurate with the time he had spent creating it – at least two hundred days (although it appears he was also working on finishing Piquet during this period) – and this may have contributed to Grosvenor's eventual loss of interest. When Hogarth presented the piece to Grosvenor, he rejected it, ostensibly because it was [...] "so striking and inimitable, that the constantly having it before one's <b>eyes</b> <b>would</b> be too often occasioning melancholy ideas to arise in one's mind"; in disgust, Hogarth released him from their bargain.|$|E
