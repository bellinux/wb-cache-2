40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a {{nonlinear}} control-system design framework {{predicated on}} a hierarchical switching controller architecture parameterized over {{a set of}} moving system equilibria is developed. Specifically, using equilibria-dependent Lyapunov functions, a hierarchical nonlinear control strategy is developed that stabilizes a given nonlinear system by stabilizing a collection of nonlinear controlled subsystems. The switching nonlinear controller architecture is designed based on a generalized lower semicontinuous Lyapunov function obtained by minimizing a potential function over a given switching set induced by the parameterized system equilibria. The proposed framework pro-vides a rigorous alternative to designing gain-scheduled feedback controllers and guarantees local and global closed-loop system stability for general nonlinear systems. <b>Index</b> Terms—Domains <b>of</b> <b>attraction,</b> dynamic compensation, equilibria-dependent Lyapunov functions, hierarchical switching control, nonlinear connective stabilization, parameterized equi-libria.

We base our study on the intersection of the basins <b>of</b> <b>attraction</b> <b>of</b> locally stable pure Nash equilibria for replicator and best-response dynamics. Local stability implies that the basin <b>of</b> <b>attraction</b> has positive measure but there are examples where the intersection of the basin <b>of</b> <b>attraction</b> for replicator and best-response dynamics is arbitrarily small.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we explore}} some {{asymptotic}} results in heavy-tailed theory. There are many empirical and compelling evidence in statistics that require modeling with heavy tailed observations. This thesis {{is divided into}} three parts. First, we consider a robust estimation of the mean vector for a sequence of independent and identically distributed observations in the domain <b>of</b> <b>attraction</b> <b>of</b> a stable law with possibly different <b>indices</b> <b>of</b> stability between 1 and 2. The suggested estimator is asymptotically normal with unknown parameters. We apply an asymptotically valid bootstrap to construct a confidence region for the mean vector. Furthermore, a simulation study is performed to show that the estimation method is efficient for conducting inference about the mean vector for multivariate heavy-tailed observations. In the second part, we present the asymptotic distribution of M-estimators for parameters in an unstable AR(p) process. The innovations are assumed to be in the domain <b>of</b> <b>attraction</b> <b>of</b> a stable law with index 0 < α ≤ 2. In particular, when the model involves repeated unit roots or conjugate complex unit roots, M- estimators have a higher asymptotic rate of convergence compared to the least square estimators. Moreover, we show that the asymptotic results can be written as Ito stochastic integrals. Finally, the preceding methodologies lead to develop the asymptotic theory of M-estimators for parameters in unstable AR(p) processes with nonzero location parameter. Similar to the preceding cases, we assume that the process is driven by innovations in the domain <b>of</b> <b>attraction</b> <b>of</b> a stable law with index 0 < α ≤ 2.
