40|$|For the {{improvement}} of APR 1400 Diverse Protection System (DPS) design, the Advanced DPS (ADPS) has recently been developed to enhance the fault tolerance capability of the system. Major fault masking features of the ADPS compared with the APR 1400 DPS are the changes to the channel configuration and reactor trip actuation equipment. To minimize the fault occurrences within the ADPS, and to mitigate the consequences of common-cause failures (CCF) within the safety I&C systems, several fault avoidance design features have been applied in the ADPS. The fault avoidance design features include the changes to the system software classification, communication methods, <b>equipment</b> <b>platform,</b> MMI equipment, etc. In addition, the fault detection, location, containment, and recovery processes have been incorporated in the ADPS design. Therefore, {{it is expected that}} the ADPS can provide an enhanced fault tolerance capability against the possible faults within the system and its input/output equipment, and the CCF of safety systems...|$|E
40|$|Thin-film silicon {{solar cells}} {{with up to}} 11. 2 % stable cell {{efficiency}} have been developed on ZnO coated glass substrates on laboratory scale using solely plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) and magnetron sputtering as deposition techniques for all thin films. To transfer this concept towards large areas, we developed a novel PECVD electrode which proved its capability of providing homogenous amorphous and microcrystalline silicon films on similar to 1 m(2) sized substrates. Microcrystalline silicon (mu c-Si:H) solar cells were realised with efficiencies up to 7. 2 %. The high open-circuit voltage V-oc and fill factor FF of 520 mV and 71 %, respectively, demonstrate that high quality pc-Si:H material can be prepared with this large area electrode. Note that finally the entire thin-film structure-including all silicon, TCO and metal films-can be produced using one single <b>equipment</b> <b>platform</b> which complies with the requirements for a cost-effective and large scale mass production.

40|$|This poster {{presents}} comparative {{results from}} the first use of the Geophysical Exploration <b>Equipment</b> <b>Platform</b> (GEEP) in Ireland in carrying out a multi-sensor survey {{in the vicinity of}} a possible Neolithic passage tomb known as Site E in the Brú na Bóinne World Heritage Site. Brú na Bóinne, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, has been an important ritual, social and economic centre for thousands of years. Much research has been undertaken in the area, including large-scale excavations at the Neolithic passage tombs of Newgrange and Knowth. However we still lack an in-depth understanding of the site’s broad range of archaeological monuments, and the landscape and communities that shaped them. To date there has been no systematic large-scale use of ground geophysical techniques although a number of successful spatially discrete geophysical surveys have been carried out. The landscape has many large, open fields under pasture or tillage suitable for systematic large-scale ground geophysical survey. Such a survey, integrated with the interpretation of other available remote sensing data is an obvious next step in the investigation of this internationally important landscape. The evaluation was successful and the {{results from the}} GEEP dataset will be presented with a comparative study of data collected by traditional hand-carried magnetic gradiometry, earth resistance and magnetic susceptibility surveys...|$|E

40|$|Due {{to their}} high {{strength}} to weight ratio and stiffness to weight ratio the use of honeycomb panels is particularly attractive in spacecraft structures. Honeycomb panels are often used in secondary satellite structures such as <b>equipment</b> <b>platforms</b> and solar arrays, {{but they can also}} be used as part of the primary structure of a satellite. Indeed honeycomb panel assemblies can be, and are, used to produce efficient and cost-effective primary structures. These types of structures have been used for some time for numerous satellites; however, their development still poses some challenges ranging from the structural performance of the panels themselves to the problem of connecting them to other panels or structural elements. These challenges are faced each time a new satellite is being developed adding cost to the design process. Furthermore, often due to strict timescales in the development process, some of the uncertainties which naturally arise from these challenges cannot always be completely addressed. To compensate for this, conservative design approaches often need to be taken with the ultimate effect of lowering the efficiency of the structure's final design. To meet these challenges and provide a better knowledge base for future satellite development projects a number of research activities have been, and are still, under way at the University of Southampton. The aim {{of this paper is to}} describe these research activities and present the key results. © 2010 IEEE...|$|R
