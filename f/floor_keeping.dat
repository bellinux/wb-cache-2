40|$|Background: Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) is a vector-borne {{infectious}} disease, {{caused by}} the protozoan Leishmania donovani, which is transmitted by phlebotomine sand flies. In an earlier study in Bihar, India, we found an association between incidence of VL and housing conditions. In the current study we investigated the influence of housing structure and conditions {{in and around the}} house on the indoor abundance of Phlebotomus argentipes, the vector of VL in this area. Methods: In each of 50 study villages in Muzaffarpur district, we randomly selected 10 houses. Light traps were installed in each house for one night during three annual peaks of sand fly density over two successive years. Sand flies captured were morphologically identified and segregated by species, sex and feeding status. Data on housing conditions and socio-economic status were also collected. We fitted a linear mixed-effects regression model with log-transformed P. argentipes counts as outcome variable and village as random effect. Results: P. argentipes was found in all but four of the 500 households. There was considerable variability between the years and the seasons. On bivariate analysis, housing structure, dampness of the <b>floor,</b> <b>keeping</b> animals inside, presence of animal dung around the house, and socio-economic status were all significantly associated with sand fly density. Highest sand fly densities were observed in thatched houses. In the multivariate model only the housing structure and socio-economic status remained significant...|$|E
40|$|As an acute-phase protein, human C-reactive protein (CRP) is {{clinically}} important. CRPs were purified {{from several}} samples in six different pathological conditions, where their levels ranged from 22 to 342 µg/ml. Small, but significant, variations in electrophoretic mobilities on native PAGE suggested differences in molecular mass, charge and/or shape. Following separation by SDS/PAGE, they showed single subunits with some {{differences in their}} molecular masses ranging between 27 and 30. 5 kDa, but for a particular disease, the mobility was the same for CRPs purified from multiple individuals or pooled sera. Isoelectric focusing (IEF) also indicated that the purified CRPs differed from each other. Glycosylation was demonstrated in these purified CRPs by Digoxigenin kits, neuraminidase treatment and binding with lectins. The presence of N-linked sugar moiety was confirmed by N-glycosidase F digestion. The presence of sialic acid, glucose, galactose and mannose has been demonstrated by gas liquid chromatography, mass spectroscopic and fluorimetric analysis. Matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization analysis of the tryptic digests of three CRPs showed systematic absence of two peptide fragments, one at the N-terminus and the other near the C-terminus. Model-building suggested {{that the loss of}} these fragments exposed two potential glycosylation sites on a cleft <b>floor</b> <b>keeping</b> the protein–protein interactions in pentraxins and calcium-dependent phosphorylcholine-binding qualitatively unaffected. Thus we have convincingly demonstrated that human CRP is glycosylated in some pathological conditions. ...|$|E

In this respect, a Gaussian beam with a linear-polarization, simple profiles of the intensity and the phase is more suitable for effective irradiation of the sample and transmission using mirror system and waveguide system. If the Gaussian beam is obtained from gyrotron output, the versatile transmission system for a Gaussian beam will be realized.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify the {{representative}} characters of Okinawan Classical Dances from the aesthetic and kinematic points of view. And this article is the second efforts in the study of Okinawan Dances. It was treated the "SHUDUN" in the traditional Okinawan woman's dances. The "SHUDUN" is the one of the typical "Winagu-Dī-Udui", which are performed by a girl with no properties, and express the wife's feeling of loneliness, lonesome and melancholy for the absence of her husband. This dance is featured with a dance technique, "SANKAKU-MIZICHI," it is said that the wife's psychological and emotional tension is mainly expressed by he performer's expression and eye with static standing posture. It was taken the following steps in this study; 1) photographing of the performance, 2) drawing the whole dance movements in every 3 or 24 sections by the profile projector, 3) making of a series of overlapping shape of dance motion, 4) arrangement of the dance construction, and 5) analysis of the dance design, time, and space from the Laban's effort shape analysis point of view. It took 14 miniutes and 28 seconds to perfome the dance and had 15, 421 sections in the film. The main results are shown following 1) Basic body shape: the lower back is not released, the waist is shrinking, the upper part of body is slightly fallen in front, the shoulders are released and arms are set the body sides, legs are bent slightly, and the line of vision takes lower point faintly.; 2) Winagu-Dachi(Basic standing shape) : the right leg is bent outside, and left leg is slightly stretched in front, then put the heel on the floor and lifted the toe., 3) Walking: all of the gesturing foot is in contact with the <b>floor</b> <b>keeping</b> with basic shape, the toes are lifted slightly, and whole body was pushed foward in constant weight., 4) Facing of the upper part of body is not free from the triangle which shaped with the face and shoulders, but synchronized the triangle., 5) The basic motion of effort shape are glide, press, wring, and dab, and, have flexible and light sustained shape., and 6) The construction of the dance "SHUDUN" is composed of three parts, that is a) Entrance, b) Dancing, and c) Exit. The main part of the dance, that is Dancing, is divided into three parts, they are "INJIFA-UDUI"(Nakama-Bushi) "NAKAUDUI" (Shudun-Bushi), and, "IRIFA-UDUI" (Shonganē-Bushi) ...|$|E

A total of 240 calf faecal samples were collected from 16 farms in two districts in Johor, Malaysia, and screened by PCR. The overall Cryptosporidium prevalence was 27. 1 %. The prevalence of Cryptosporidium species in pre-weaned calves was 32. 4 % for C. parvum, 26. 5 % for C. bovis, followed by C. andersoni (20. 6 %), C. ryanae (11. 8 %) and mixed sp. (8. 8 %). The prevalence of Cryptosporidium species in post-weaned calves was 35 % for C. bovis followed by C. andersoni and C. ryanae (30 % each) and mixed sp. (5 %). Subtyping analysis of 8 of the 11 C. parvum isolates at the gp 60 locus identified five isolates as IIdA 15 G 1, one as IIa 18 A 3 R 1 and two isolates as IIa 17 G 2 R 1.

40|$|High {{frequency}} gyrotrons offer clear {{advantages in}} the millimeter to the submillimeter wavelemgth range {{due to their}} high output powers from several hundred watts up to several kW. In addition, gyrotrons {{have the advantage of}} tuning the output frequency by selecting the operating mode. However, a gyrotron produces a TEmn waveguide mode whose radiation pattern does not correspond to usual requirements. In order to widen the use of the high frequency gyrotron. We need a quasi-optical system to handle gyrotron output as a structure of a Gaussian beam (TEM 00 mode) which is suitable for transmission and application because of a linearly-polarization, simple intensity profile and wave front. Development of the system to convert the gyrotron output into the Gaussian beam is now in progress. If the Gaussian beam is obtained from gyrotron output using this system, the versatile transmission system for a Gaussian beam will be realized. In this system, confocal mirror systems are formed among the second floor, the third floor and the forth floor of the building of Research Center for Development of Far-Infrared Region.

30|$|On a more {{operational}} level Andon {{was supported by}} decentralization, i.e., the allocation of decision rights to workers and team leaders who were entitled to pull the Andon cord (and, possibly, stop the line). This had positive effects on performance because it potentially reduced quality problems. The second design choice was the standardized sequence of behaviors, coupled with artifacts (the Andon cord) that the actors involved performed. This set of routines helped prevent quality problems by avoiding the passing of defects downstream in the assembly process, without stopping production. Due to the standardization of behavioral routines actual line stoppages were reduced to a necessary minimum. This did not only affect productivity positively but also had second order effects on quality (stoppages increases frequency of errors due to workers’ cognitive distraction). The third design choice was the availability of team leaders by having a small ratio of team leaders to workers (approximately 1 : 5). This improved the line productivity per se, for example, by covering absences or assisting workers in various ways. In fact, this operational availability was an important indicator of a shop <b>floor’s</b> capability of <b>keeping</b> its production line flowing.|$|R

His CMLL debut match took place on July 20, 2010, and saw him team up with Mini Maximo and Último Dragóncito to defeat Cisne, Pequeño Nitro and Pequeño Violencia. As part of CMLL's bicentennial celebrations, celebrating the 200th anniversary of Mexico's independence CMLL held two Torneo Bicentenario tournament one of which was for the Mini-Estrellas division. The winner of the tournament would be [...] "promoted" [...] to compete in the regular division going forward. The tournament took place over three Sundays in August, from August 10 to August 24. To qualify for the finale on August 24 a wrestler had to win an eight-man Torneo cibernetico to outlast his competitors. Pequeño Halcón competed in the second block of the tournament, but was the second person eliminated in the match. Halcón was one of 16 Mini-Estrellas to compete in a Ruleta de la Muerte, ("Roulette of Death"). In a Ruleta de la Muerte tournament tag teams face off in a single elimination tournament, but unlike traditional tournaments it is the losing team that advances in this case. The team that loses the tag team match final must immediately wrestle against each other in a Lucha de Apuestas match, where either their mask or their hair is on the line. Pequeño Halcón teamed up with Mini Maxmio in the fight to keep their mask or hair (in Mini Maximo's case) safe. In the first round they defeated the team of CMLL World Mini-Estrella Champion Pequeño Olímpico and Shockercito, protecting their mask and hair. He entered the Mexico City version of the 2012 Pequeños Reyes del Aire ("Little Kings of the Air") tournament, but was eliminated early on in the 16-man torneo cibernetico match.

40|$|A {{cohort study}} was {{performed}} on 150 HF X Black Pied crossbred dairy cattle in order to compare the effects of rubber flooring and solid concrete floors on claw horn quality, horn growth and wear, net growth, lameness and claw health. To this end on a dairy farm with 628 dairy cattle one of two identical buildings was established with rubber flooring (KURA P®, Gummiwerk Kraiburg Elastik GmbH, Tittmoning/ Obb.). After calving the animals were either assigned to the group housed in the building with rubber flooring or the building with solid concrete floors. No differences existed {{between the two groups}} with respect to hygiene management and food and water supply. Approximately two weeks before calving heifers were transported to the dairy farm from a rearing farm, where the latter animals had been kept solely on straw bedding. In contrast, the dairy cows of the second and higher lactations on the farm already had a history of being kept alternately on free stalls with concrete flooring or straw bedding. The observation period lasted 15 weeks for single animals being kept either on rubber flooring or solid concrete floors. It started with functional claw trimming. At claw-trimming {{and at the end of}} the observational period documentation of claw lesions using the DLG-Score took place and horn samples were obtained from the sole segment of the right lateral hind claw, which were examined by light microscopy. The number of horn tubules per mm², the diameter of the horn tubules as well as the relation between the area of the marrow zone and the cortex of the different tubules were determined. In addition net horn growth was determined from wear and growth characteristics of the claw horn at the dorsal wall. Lameness scoring (Sprecher et al., 1997) took place in two-week intervals. Claw health was evaluated by recording new cases of claw disorders that had occurred during the observation period and the cure rate. The number of horn tubules per mm² of first, second and third or higher lactation cattle ranged from 22 to 28, 34 to 40, 39 to 44, respectively in the group of animals kept on rubber floors compared to 31 to 33, 33 to 39, 35 to 46, respectively on solid concrete floors. At the end of the observation period the number of horn tubules for calved heifers kept on rubber flooring was lower than for the same group of animals kept on solid concrete floors. As the number of horn tubules is genetically fixed, the lower number of horn tubules in the group housed on rubber was thought to be the consequence of a higher water content of the horn located between the tubules leading to larger distances between the single horn tubules. The latter effect was not observed in animals with lactation numbers of two and higher. Horn from the sole segment of animals of the first lactation belonging either to the group kept on rubber or on solid concrete floors had lower numbers of horn tubules than cattle of lactation two and higher. The diameter of horn tubules of first, second and third or higher lactation cattle ranged from 76 µm to 78 µm, 58 µm to 62 µm, 62 µm to 62 µm, respectively in the group of animals kept on rubber floors compared to 61 µm to 63 µm, 51 µm to 51 µm, 47 µm to 50 µm, respectively on solid concrete floors. With respect to the diameter of horn tubules no differences were observed between cattle kept on rubber floors or solid concrete floors. In addition there were no significant changes in the relation between the areas of the marrow zone to the cortex of the horn tubules between the two groups. The diameter of horn tubules being larger for cattle of the first lactation in either group suggests that the animals have also larger dermal papillae. The relation between the area of the marrow zone and the cortex of the different tubules ranged from 1. 74 to 1. 90, 1. 91 to 1. 87, 1. 69 to 1. 77, respectively in the group of animals kept on rubber floors compared to 1. 93 to 2. 00, 1. 96 to 2. 14, 1. 91 to 2. 00, respectively on solid concrete floors. With respect to the relation between the area of the marrow zone and the cortex of the different tubules no differences were observed between cattle kept on rubber floors or solid concrete floors. The monthly horn growth of first, second and third or higher lactation cattle were 4. 4 mm, 3. 9 mm, 3. 7 mm, respectively in the group of animals kept on rubber floors versus 4. 7 mm, 4. 1 mm, 3. 7 mm, respectively on solid concrete floors. The monthly horn wear of first, second and third or higher lactation cattle were 1. 8 mm, 0. 5 mm, 0. 5 mm, respectively in the group of animals kept on rubber floors versus 2. 5 mm, 0. 7 mm, 0. 6 mm, respectively on solid concrete floors. This results in a monthly net horn growth of first, second and third or higher lactation cattle of 2. 5 mm, 3. 5 mm, 3. 2 mm, respectively in the group of animals kept on rubber floors versus 2. 2 mm, 3. 4 mm, 3. 2 mm, respectively on solid concrete floors. Animals of the first lactation showed slightly smaller amounts of horn growth and horn wear compared to older animals. However, net horn growth did not differ between animals kept on rubber flooring versus solid concrete floors. The small amount of horn wear on solid concrete floors might be related to a lack of exercise of the animals due to the slippery solid concrete floors. The latter is also reflected in the net growth rates of claw horn of animals on concrete flooring being more than 3 mm/month. Net horn growth of the bulb of first, second and third or higher lactation cattle were 2. 0 mm, 2. 2 mm, 2. 1 mm, respectively in the group of animals kept on rubber floors versus 1. 5 mm, 1. 6 mm, 2. 1 mm, respectively on solid concrete floors. There were no differences observed with respect to the flooring types. The prevalence of lameness ranged from 14 % to 31 % (rubber floors) and 28 % to 42 % (solid concrete floors). They did not differ in the two groups at any date of observation. In addition, no differences were observed with respect to lactation numbers. The prevalence of laminitis-associated disorders were already high at the start of the observational period (1 st, 2 nd and 3 rd or higher lactation: 71 %, 87 %, 87 % (rubber floors); 90 %, 99 %, 99 % (solid concrete floors). After 15 weeks laminitis-associated disorders were observed in nearly all claws. Defects of the white line (WLD), sole haemorrhages and double soles were the most prominent lesions observed in this context. There was no difference found with respect to the occurrence of new cases of defects of the white line and sole haemorrhages between the two groups, however the cure rate of the latter diseases was higher for animals of the third and higher lactation that were kept on rubber floors. In addition, the latter effect was also observed for defects of the white line and haemorrhages of animals of the first lactation kept on rubber flooring. Based on the latter findings the conclusion can be drawn that the type flooring does not lead to a reduction in cases of subclinical laminitis which might have been caused by fermentation disorders, but rubber flooring seems to enhance the process of recovery. The occurrence of new cases and the cure rates of double soles, slurry heel, digital dermatitis and interdigital dermatitis were not affected by the type of flooring. Animals of the first lactation that were kept on rubber floors had a smaller number of lesions related to dermatitis digitalis. The following conclusions can be drawn from the results of the study: Claw horn quality of rubber flooring dairy cattle does not differ from cattle kept on solid concrete floors. Net growth of dairy cattle kept on rubber floors is not higher as net growth of dairy cattle kept on slippery solid concrete floors. Prevalence of lameness does not differ between cattle kept on rubber or solid concrete <b>floors.</b> <b>Keeping</b> cattle on rubber floors does not lead to a better claw health if management based problems such moisture of alleys, bad stall comfort or feeding are not previously solved...|$|R
40|$|Academic {{scholarship}} {{pertaining to}} Oriental rugs, which {{began at the}} end of the nineteenthcentury, has concentrated mainly on connoisseurship and the study of the cultures of origin and the peoples that have produced these items with a particular bias for items produced without the taint of Western influence. Little attention has been paid to the actual consumption of Oriental rugs in the West and the general influence of this trade on the evolution of decorative taste or how they may reflect changes in cultural and social attitudes. Oriental rugs within the Canada have received even less attention leading to assumptions that the taste for Eastern floor-coverings in Canada followed similar trends to England and the United States. This discussion will focus on the Canadian context by using Toronto to explore the consumption of Oriental rugs during the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries and examine the decorative taste of middle and upper class households in order to understand the various factors that influenced the popularity of Oriental rugs during this period. The simultaneous influence of international decorative trends coupled with changing attitudes toward domestic cleanliness and the work of retailers and the carpet trade all contributed to elevate the popularity of Oriental rugs to the point that they became commonplace floor coverings absorbed into the general lexicon of the tasteful interior. Eastern rugs first came to North America with wealthy colonists keen to outfit their homes with fine furnishings. Initially, they were imported through trade with England, but direct trade with Turkish ports opened after the American Revolution in 1784. Numerous eighteenth-century American portraits illustrate rugs underfoot and draped on tabletops. Such carpets also appeared in numerous American household inventories from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, attesting to their popularity and widespread consumption. Large scale European settlement of Upper Canada, or what is known as the Province of Ontario today, by the British began in earnest after the American Revolution when England was forced to find land for those that remained loyal to the crown during the conflict. Partly due to the scarcity of resources and partly due to a fashion away from Oriental rugs, hand-knotted pile carpeting appears to have been virtually non-existent in Upper Canada during the early years of settlement in the late-eighteenth-century and early nineteenth-centuries. Bourgeois interiors during this period would have been similar to the one depicted in the conversation piece painted by William Berczy in 1809. The painting depicted the wealthy Woolsey family of Quebec arranged in a neoclassical interior. The painted geometric design on the <b>floor</b> was in <b>keeping</b> with the tenants of balance and symmetric that typified the classical decorative taste of the period, notions that were seen to be at odds with the design sensibilities of Eastern floor coverings, however it was these same characteristics, particularly asymmetry, that later encouraged their popularity...|$|R
5000|$|In the mid-season premiere [...] "What Happened and What's Going On", after Tyreese {{is killed}} Sasha is seen visibly distraught {{so much so}} that she can not even pick up a shovel to help bury his body. In the episode [...] "Them", the group are sixty miles from DC and Sasha {{continues}} to grieve for her recent losses. She lashes out at walkers in rage, breaking the group's formation to not use weapons in order to converge energy, leaving the group forced to help her in killing them. Michonne shows concern and warns her that her rage could get her killed. She kills a pack of wild dogs that threaten the group and they serve as food for the group. Maggie and Sasha bond over their recent deaths alone together as a man suddenly walks up to them and introduces himself as Aaron (Ross Marquand). He asks to talk to Rick, saying he has good news. In the episode [...] "Remember", Aaron has recruited the group to Alexandria after initial distrust, and Sasha is not given a job yet. The episode [...] "Forget" [...] focuses on Sasha's post-traumatic stress disorder and struggle to adjust to Alexandria's lifestyle. She takes shooting practices outside the walls and later volunteers to keep watch in the guard tower outside Alexandria. Deanna Monroe (Tovah Feldshuh) agrees on the condition that she can attend her party. Sasha reluctantly attends and meets Spencer Monroe (Austin Nichols) who takes an interest in her. She later lashes out and leaves after being asked what her favorite meal is and hearing other trivial matters, receiving flashes of the recent people who have died. The next day, Deanna asks Sasha what happened and she responds that Alexandria [...] "isn't real", referring to its sense of suburbia but Deanna, while accepting of her trauma, dismisses it and hands her a box of ammunition, leaving her to her new job. In the episode [...] "Try", Sasha becomes overwhelmed with guilt after learning of Noah's death, as she told him he would die, and begins hunting walkers. Concerned Michonne and Rosita go out to find her where they find her fighting a pack of walkers and narrowly save her though she yells at Michonne stating that she didn't need to be saved, before breaking down and telling them about what she said to Noah and how guilty it is making her feel. Later she returns to the tower and shoots down a pack of walkers headed for the gates. In the season finale [...] "Conquer", Sasha is first seen carting walkers individually into a mass grave alone, outside Alexandria. She then lies in the grave in silence. She is later seen sitting quietly in Alexandria's chapel, when Gabriel walks in. She asks him if he can help her, to which he replies [...] "No". Gabriel accuses her of killing even when she had no reason to or it wasn't in self-defense, and aggressively throws guilt on her shoulders. She shouts for him to stop, before the two have a brief fight. Sasha ultimately wins this fight and points her weapon at Gabriel, who is lying on the <b>floor</b> with Sasha <b>keeping</b> him down with her foot. Maggie walks in and defuses this situation, and the three of them are later seen in a circle in the chapel, praying.|$|R
40|$|Globally, house flies (Musca domestica) play an {{important}} role by disturbing livestock and by transmitting disease pathogens. The modern and intensively managed pig farms offer house flies optimal conditions for their survival and reproduction. The floating layer of manure in the current, completely slatted <b>floor</b> system for <b>keeping</b> fattening pigs or sows – together with constantly high temperatures – allows fly reproduction throughout the year regardless of external climatic influence. During recent years there have been reports on an increase of insecticide resistance (IR) in animal husbandry management systems. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the eventual occurrence and the distribution of insecticide resistance in M. domestica on pig farms of the federal state of Schleswig-Holstein. A cross sectional survey assessing occurrence and distribution of IR was conducted on 40 pig farms based on the results of a preliminary questionnaire survey. The susceptibility of M. domestica against the contact insecticide deltamethrin was evaluated by using the FlyBox®-method. Commercial formulations of thiamethoxam, imidacloprid and azamethiphos – all of them feed-through insecticides – were tested under pen side conditions as were the larvicides cyromazine and triflumuron. The results allowed selecting 19 conspicuous fly populations, which were subsequently assessed following their establishment as laboratory strains. Additionally, the topical application was used for an evaluation of pyrethrum, deltamethrin, phoxim, azamethiphos, thiamethoxam and imidacloprid as pure active ingredients. While the exposure for feed-through insecticides lasted for one hour during the on-farm assays, the exposure lasted for 48 hours under laboratory conditions in order to ensure an optimal intake of the active ingredient. The efficacy of both larvicides was also assessed by using other than commercial concentrations. Analysis of the questionnaires revealed that highest fly numbers were observed from July to September. Use of chemical products constituted the mainstay of pest management. Products against adult insects as well as larvicides were routinely used and their efficacy judged as mostly satisfactory by the farmers. On-farm assays showed distinct differences between the feed-through insecticides azamethiphos, thiamethoxam and imidacloprid after an exposure of 1 hour. At the end of an observation period of 24 hours thiamethoxam was found to be the most effective with an average paralysis rate of 91 % contrasting with, respectively, 66 % for azamethiphos and 62 % for imidacloprid. Trials with the pyrethroid deltamethrin by using the FlyBox®-method indicated considerable resistance of the field populations. Following an exposure for 10 seconds, 20 (50 %) of the populations displayed a paralysis inferior to 40 % after 60 minutes. Despite treatment with triflumuron of the larval medium at the commercially recommended dose (5 mg/kg), about 30 % flies were able to emerge from egg deposits. Cyromazine proved to be 100 % effective at the commercially recommended dose of 5 mg/kg. Repetition of the tests with feed-through insecticides under laboratory conditions showed after 3 hours thiamethoxam to achieve the fastest and highest paralysis. The average paralysis rate after 48 hours amounted to 94 %. When exposed to azamethiphos, the highest average paralysis rate was recorded after 4 hours (62 %). Exposure for 48 hours resulted in a paralysis of 96 %. Imidacloprid was found to be the least effective, thereby confirming the results of the on-farm assays. Natural pyrethrum showed little effect when topically applied. Application of the discriminating dose (DD) of 2. 200 ng per fly resulted in an average paralysis of 38 % after 24 hours. However, the same dose resulted in an average paralysis of 86 % when the pyrethroid deltamethrin was used, which contrasted with the results of the on-farm assays when the FlyBox® method had been used. A reduction of the amount of the active ingredient should be considered in future work dealing with an assessment of IR. It is expected that this approach would help to better understand the range of IR. The topical application of the DD of the phosphoric acid phoxim resulted in an average paralysis rate of 28 %. A 16 -fold increase of the DD increased the average paralysis to 93 %. When applying the DD for azamethiphos of 310 ng per fly, 12 (71 %) displayed a medium resistance but three populations proved to be highly resistant. Both thiamethoxam und imidacloprid did not induce notable paralysis when topically applied despite their mixture with acetone and oil as solvent. Thiamethoxam showed an average paralysis of 37 % after 24 hours when the DD of 320 ng per fly was applied. A 16 -fold increase of the DD yielded an average paralysis of only 76 %. Imidacloprid proved even less effective. The 16 -fold DD only produced an average paralysis of 54 %. The larvicidal tests confirmed prior results of the on-farm evaluations: cyromazine used in a dose of 4 mg/kg resulted in 100 % inhibition. The commercially recommended dose amounts to 5 mg/kg. Even a further reduction to 1 mg/kg prevented the emergence by 79 % on average. This contrasted with the findings when triflumuron was used: 4 mg/kg medium merely inhibited the development of 5 out of the 19 tested populations (26 %). It can be concluded that an eventual IR has to be ruled out before the selection of a specific insecticide for the control of adult flies. The use of persistent pyrethroids should be avoided. Preference should be given to natural derives of pyrethrum that are reinforced by synergists like piperonyl butoxide (PBO). A strategic application of chemical products is recommended taking into account seasonal population dynamics, which might assist in avoiding an exacerbation of already existing IR and to prevent new resistance. Further sensible approaches are a rotational scheme of still effective ingredients and a regular mechanical dung removal at weekly intervals. Biological control methods, e. g. releases of insect parasitoids should be considered as another alternative...|$|R
