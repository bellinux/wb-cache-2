5|$|A {{chelator}} for binding a radioisotope can be attached. Pendetide, {{a derivative}} of pentetic acid, {{is used for}} <b>example</b> <b>in</b> capromab pendetide to chelate indium-111.

Consequently, indium (111In) capromab pendetide is the name for the above example including indium-111.|$|E
5|$|A {{major change}} {{was made in}} the way overfulfillment was rewarded. Progressive piece-rates, where rates {{increased}} as outputs grew, were ended, and workers were paid a one-off bonus upon overachieving a quota. Where bonus rates were retained for each percentage of overfulfillment, they were capped. For <b>example,</b> <b>in</b> engineering, bonuses could not exceed 20 percent of their normal earnings.|$|E
5|$|A {{slightly}} variant way of executing {{people by}} means of impalement was to force an iron meat hook beneath a person's ribs and hang him up to die slowly.

5|$|As {{well as the}} {{evolution}} of new metabolic pathways, evolution can also cause the loss of metabolic functions. For <b>example,</b> <b>in</b> some parasites metabolic processes that are not essential for survival are lost and preformed amino acids, nucleotides and carbohydrates may instead be scavenged from the host. Similar reduced metabolic capabilities are seen in endosymbiotic organisms.|$|E
5|$|Because of titanium's {{superior}} {{strength and}} light weight {{relative to other}} metals (steel, stainless steel, and aluminium), and because of recent advances in metalworking techniques, its use has become more widespread {{in the manufacture of}} firearms. Primary uses include pistol frames and revolver cylinders. For the same reasons, it is used in the body of laptop computers (for <b>example,</b> <b>in</b> Apple's PowerBook line).|$|E
5|$|Cacti {{may also}} be planted {{outdoors}} in regions with suitable climates. Concern for water conservation in arid regions {{has led to the}} promotion of gardens requiring less watering (xeriscaping). For <b>example,</b> <b>in</b> California, the East Bay Municipal Utility District sponsored the publication of a book on plants and landscapes for summer-dry climates. Cacti are one group of drought-resistant plants recommended for dry landscape gardening.|$|E
