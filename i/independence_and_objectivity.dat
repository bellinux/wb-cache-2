They work for government agencies (federal, state and local); for publicly traded companies; and for non-profit companies across all industries. The internationally recognised standard setting body for the profession is the Institute of Internal Auditors - IIA (www.theiia.org). The IIA has defined internal auditing as follows: [...] "Internal auditing is an independent, objective assurance and consulting activity designed to add value and improve an organisation's operations. It helps an organisation accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, control, and governance processes". Thus professional internal auditors provide independent and objective audit and consulting services focused on evaluating whether the board of directors, shareholders, stakeholders, and corporate executives have reasonable assurance that the organization's governance, risk management, and control processes are designed adequately and function effectively. Internal audit professionals (Certified Internal Auditors - CIAs) are governed by the international professional standards and code of conduct of the Institute of Internal Auditors. While internal auditors are not independent {{of the companies that}} employ them, <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> <b>objectivity</b> are a cornerstone of the IIA professional standards; and are discussed at length in the standards and the supporting practice guides and practice advisories. Professional internal auditors are mandated by the IIA standards to be independent of the business activities they audit. This <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> <b>objectivity</b> are achieved through the organizational placement and reporting lines of the internal audit department. Internal auditors of publicly traded companies in the United States are required to report functionally {{to the board of directors}} directly, or a sub-committee of the board of directors (typically the audit committee), and not to management except for administrative purposes. As described often in the professional literature for the practice of internal auditing (such as Internal Auditor, the journal of the IIA) -, or other similar and generally recognized frameworks for management control when evaluating an entity's governance and control practices; and apply COSO's [...] "Enterprise Risk Management-Integrated Framework" [...] or other similar and generally recognized frameworks for entity-wide risk management when evaluating an organization's entity-wide risk management practices.

30|$|What follows {{are some}} {{clarifications}} on the above explained procedure {{and on its}} position in the scientific research. It doesn’t mean that in order to make discoveries or to give scientific explanations it is necessary to have an authorized method that respects the principles of fundamental measurement. The cited properties of linearity, stochastic <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> specific <b>objectivity</b> have always been associated with the concept of measurement, and not that of discovery and explanation. Certainly, a good mathematical model can produce qualitatively better and more precise measurements. Therefore, the idea is that a more refined instrument can, in certain situations, provide a better description and explanation of an already known phenomenon, while in other situations it may lead to a discovery. The example of the telescope seems fitting: in some cases, a telescope with a better power of resolution allows one to see an already known planet better, but in other cases it may lead to the identification of new ones, that is, discoveries.|$|R

To simplify somewhat {{the complexity of the}} discussion, it can say that an objective measurement can be made if the gathered empirical data are described by a mathematical model that has three fundamental properties: linearity, stochastic <b>independence,</b> <b>and</b> specific <b>objectivity.</b> It is possible to sum up these three properties in one term with the so-called property of concatenation: if you add (or concatenate) to object mass 1 (or concatenate) a second object mass 2, a third object is obtained whose mass is equal to the first two added together.

40|$|Internal {{auditors}} {{are expected}} to be increasingly involved in Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) by adding value to the organization and providing assurance that the entity’s risk exposures are properly understood and managed. The Institute of Internal Auditors ’ (IIA, 2009) revised position paper defines the internal auditor’s role in ERM as measuring and monitoring performance, {{and at the same time}} evaluating the effectiveness of management’s risk monitoring process. In this paper, the author proposes a conceptual framework to assess whether potential conflicts exist with the role of the internal auditor in companies with fully implemented ERM frameworks. The existence of conflicts would depend on whether the internal auditor’s <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> <b>objectivity</b> is impaired. The proposed conceptual framework suggests that the internal auditor’s <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> <b>objectivity</b> would not be impaired when it leads and maintains the ERM framework. In addition, the internal auditor’s <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> <b>objectivity</b> would not be impaired when it spends more time performing ERM consulting activities versus providing assurance on controls. Finally, the proposed conceptual framework suggests that the internal auditor’s <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> <b>objectivity</b> would not be impaired when it reports to a separate board risk management committee. From the review of prior literature on the internal auditor’s role in ERM, hypotheses are developed to suggest a relationship between the internal auditor’s <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> <b>objectivity</b> with performing a leading and maintaining role in ERM...|$|E
40|$|<b>Independence</b> <b>and</b> <b>objectivity</b> are the {{cornerstones}} of the auditing profession. Even though {{internal auditing}} is generally not mandatory for companies to set up, its importance these days has increased phenomenally {{due to the fact}} that it assists companies to systematically evaluate and improve their risk management, internal controls and governance processes. Internal auditors are therefore expected to be independent and objective in order to provide unbiased and reliable reports, and to win the trust and confidence of people though admittedly, <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> <b>objectivity</b> are not easy to achieve in reality since the internal auditors are employees of the company they audit and report on.   The purpose of this study was thus, to critically investigate if <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> <b>objectivity</b> can truly be achieved in practice by employing a case study of the Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM). Accordingly, empirical data was gathered from the above-mentioned bank via the administration of questionnaire to seven internal auditors.   The study revealed through a qualitative content analysis of the data collected that, the internal auditors of RBM are indeed independent and objective in their profession because the bank has instituted the right organizational structures and the Internal Audit Department has made tremendous effort in complying with best practices in the internal audit profession. This has created a proper work environment as well as developed an appropriate attitude within staff that has allowed a high level of <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> <b>objectivity</b> to be achieved. Based on the evidence of RBM, we can therefore say that the <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> <b>objectivity</b> of an internal auditor can truly be achieved in practice...|$|E

40|$|Background: The audit has {{not always}} been as it is today. The first law {{requiring}} auditing was legislated in the Companies Act 1895. Many events have taken place in the audit history; among them was the Krueger crash, which affected the auditing profession hard in Sweden. This led to new recommendations and laws that would save the profession. Because of the events in the past, there are many who question the audit profession and discussions have been held regarding the auditor's <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> <b>objectivity.</b> Nov. 1, 2010 abolished the audit requirement for certain companies. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study is}} to describe and analyze the role of the auditor - the <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> <b>objectivity,</b> by perusing the number of qualified / unqualified audit reports, before and after removal of the audit requirement. Methodology: To answer the study's purpose, a quantitative study was conducted in which 400 annual reports from Stockholm and 200 annual reports outside of Stockholm, has been selected to be examined, to see how the number of qualified / unqualified audit reports has changed during the years 2008 - 2011. Theoretical Framework: The theories that have been applied in the study are the auditor's role, Independence & Objectivity and Profession. Framework: To complement the theoretical framework the audit significance, audit procedure, audit report and previous studies have been applied. Empirism: The data collected for this study is illustrated in diagrams showing that 2010 was a defining year where most unqualified audit reports were reported, while the remaining years showed non or few unqualified audit reports. Conclusion: Based on the empirical evidence presented, auditor's <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> <b>objectivity</b> has been questioned.

The SSB of such institutions plays an invaluable role to protect the interests of various stakeholders by scrutinizing and ensuring that all IB products and practices are Shariah complaint. However, given the immense complexity of the tasks entrusted to the SSB, it becomes imperative that SSB members possess the necessary combinations of knowledge, skills, abilities and experiences to undertake such responsibilities in an effective manner. Despite its importance, empirical scrutiny of this issue is sparse.

Findings suggest that SSB-related disclosures are generally poor and tend to vary from one country to another. Additionally, we analyze the extent of cross-board memberships.

Although there has been a strong acceptance and recognition of the internal audit function in professional practice, much of academic researchersâ€™ attention has been drawn on external audit research. In this view, the {{study sought to}} establish factors that affect the performance of audit function focusing on internal audit. The research employed quantitative research methodology.

The existence of an audit committee in NSSA enhances internal audit independence. However, internal audit objectivity may be impaired as auditors try to maintain good relationship with management who have an input in shaping their future advancement within the organisation.
