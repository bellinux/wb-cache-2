500|$|After Kapadia's {{separation}} from Khanna in 1982, she was keen on returning to acting, which she ultimately did in 1984. For the next decade, {{she would go}} on to become one of top five commercial actresses in Bollywood along with Sridevi, Madhuri Dixit, Meenakshi Sheshadri and Jaya Prada. Kapadia accredited the reason for her return was because of a personal need to prove to herself her own capabilities. The first film she worked on was Saagar, directed by Ramesh Sippy, after a mutual friend had notified Sippy about her willingness to return to acting. She first performed a screen test, which according to her was very unsuccessful as she was extremely nervous and [...] "literally shivering" [...] while making it. To her surprise, Sippy ultimately signed her on to play the lead part opposite her Bobby co-star Rishi Kapoor. Scripted with her in mind, the film was intended to be her comeback vehicle, but its one-year delay meant that several of her proceeding projects would be released before, the first of which was Zakhmi Sher (1984). Saagar eventually premiered in August 1985 and was controversial for several scenes featuring Kapadia, including one scene in which she was seen topless <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>split</b> <b>second.</b> The film was a critical success and was eventually chosen as India's official entry to the Oscars that year. Kapadia's performance as Mona D'Silva, a young woman from Goa who is torn between her friend (Kamal Haasan) and the man she loves (Kapoor), won her a second Best Actress award at the Filmfare Awards. A review by Asiaweek labelled her [...] "a delight". Rediff.com noted, [...] "Dimple, caught between a friend and lover, performed solidly and memorably, grounding the two male leads and making the film work." [...] A 1993 issue of India Today wrote, [...] "Saagar was in many ways a paean to her incredible beauty. She looked ravishing: auburn hair, classical face, deep eyes, an aura of sensuality. It was clear she was back." ...|$|E

2500|$|At 15:04 {{my flight}} was {{attacked}} by three MiGs, two from the ‘10 o’clock’ and one from the ´6 o’clock´. Initially I didn’t see this last one because I had been concentrating on those approaching head-on. My WSO excitedly warned me about this rapidly approaching MiG, which was within firing range of my #3 and #4. I hesitated a while before interrupting my attack against the two MiGs in front, because I had seen the ‘Olds’ flight passing below us a few seconds before. I thought that the plane seen by my WSO {{could be one of}} them. Despite that, I suddenly turned left and then right, and caught sight of the third MiG. I ordered to my numbers 3 and 4 to break right. [...] As they did so, the MiG broke left for some mysterious reason and <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>split</b> <b>second</b> we were side by side. [...] We were so close that, besides the red stars in his wings, I could clearly see the pilot’s face. [...] I began a horizontal barrel roll to get away from him and into an attack position, once in position, I launched a Sidewinder. [...] The missile missed because the evading MiG broke left at full throttle. [...] But when he did it, he put himself {{in the line of fire}} of my number 2, Captain Everett T. Raspberry. [...] I ordered him to follow the prey, because the two aircraft that I initially saw had been placed in my forward sector. [...] I was in an advantageous position, so I fired two AIM-9s against them in a quick sequence, and I turned to place myself as wingman of my #2, Captain Raspberry. [...] I kept on descending besides Captain Raspberry and I remember that I thought that he was still out of the optimal launching envelope. But he performed a barrel roll that placed him in a perfect position again and he launched an AIM-9 which hit against the tail section of the MiG-21. It was shaken violently and later fell in a slow, almost plane spin.|$|E

40|$|Peter Lewis ([1997]) has {{recently}} {{argued that the}} wavefunction collapse theory of GRW (Ghirardi, Rimini, and Weber [1986]) can only {{solve the problem of}} wavefunction tails at the expense of predicting that arithmetic does not apply to ordinary macroscopic objects. More specifically, Lewis argues that the GRW theory must violate the enumeration principle: that `if marble 1 is in the box and marble 2 is in the box and so on through marble $n$, then all $n$ marbles are in the box' ([1997], p. 321). Ghirardi and Bassi ([1999]) have replied that it is meaningless to say that the enumeration principle is violated because the wavefunction Lewis uses to exhibit the violation cannot persist, according to the GRW theory, <b>for</b> more than <b>a</b> <b>split</b> <b>second</b> ([1999], p. 709). On the contrary, we argue that Lewis's argument survives Ghirardi and Bassi's criticism unscathed. We then go on to show that, while the enumeration principle can fail in the GRW theory, the theory itself guarantees that the principle can never be empirically falsified, leaving the applicability of arithmetical reasoning to both micro- and macroscopic objects intact.

5000|$|As {{the passing}} game evolved, a second wide {{receiver}} position was added. While {{it is possible to}} move the opposite end out wide <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>split</b> end position most teams preferred to leave that end in close to provide extra blocking protection on the quarterback's blind side. That player was essentially playing the modern day tight end position. Instead of moving the blind side end out, one of the three running backs was split wide instead, creating the flanker position. The flanker lined up off the line of scrimmage like a running back or quarterback, but <b>split</b> outside like <b>a</b> <b>split</b> end. Lining up behind the line of scrimmage gave flankers some advantages. Flankers have more [...] "space" [...] between themselves and a pressing defensive back, so cornerbacks can not as easily [...] "jam" [...] them at the line of scrimmage. This is in addition to being eligible for motion plays, allowing for the flanker to move laterally before and during the snap.

[...] McKinley staggered backwards and to the right, but was prevented from falling by Cortelyou, Milburn, and Detective Geary; they guided him across some fallen bunting to a chair. The President tried to convince Cortelyou he was not seriously injured, but blood was visible as he tried to expose his injury.

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this thesis was initially motivated by the excessive accident rates for inexperienced drivers. Researchers have previously attempted to discover what type of experience is gained during driving, and how this reduces accident liability. This research was primarily concerned with the visual acquisition of information during driving, and how this ability varies with driving experience. The first experiment was conducted to assess which of two methods was the better suited to the assess the hypothesis. The results favoured eye tracking drivers in both the laboratory and while actually driving in the real world. On this basis experiments 2 and 3 were conducted. Experiment 2 required participants to drive along a set route while being eye tracked, while experiment 3 measured the eye movements of participants as they watched driving videos in a laboratory hazard perception test. The former experiment revealed experiential differences that extended the findings in the literature. The latter experiment revealed very few experiential differences however. The failure of the hazard perception test to evoke such differences was discussed {{in regard to the}} limitations of eye tracking methodology. If experienced drivers have less accidents than their inexperienced counterparts, then one would expect differences to occur in their search strategies. However, if the differences between drivers of varying experience lie within peripheral rather than foveal vision, the straightforward measuring of eye movements may not reveal the true differences. On the basis of the results so far and the literature, it was suggested that experience may allow greater deployment of attention in the peripheral field. Three artificial experiments were undertaken to assess the relationship between foveal demand and eccentricity, before returning to the driving context. In the two final experiments participants of varying driving experience watched the same hazard perception clips previously used in experiment 3. The primary task was either to rate each clip along the dimensions of danger and difficulty, or to press a foot pedal in response to the appearance of a dangerous event. The secondary task required participants to press a button whenever they saw a peripheral target light. Peripheral detection ability was found to degrade with increases in foveal demand (the appearance of a hazard in the hazard perception clips) and eccentricity. Of most importance however was the effect of experience. As drivers gain experience they are able to devote more attention to the peripheral visual field, though the appearance of a hazard degraded peripheral attention across all eccentricities and levels of experience. A detailed analysis of the time line of degradation revealed that though the experienced drivers suffered a greater degradation of peripheral attention with the appearance of a hazard than the less experienced participants, this degradation occurred <b>for</b> only <b>a</b> <b>split</b> <b>second.</b> Learner drivers however suffered the effects of this demand-modulated degradation of peripheral attention for over two seconds. Together these results provide evidence <b>for</b> <b>an</b> attentional skill that modifies the timing and magnitude of attention focusing due to an increase in foveal demand. This is a skill that seems to be learned with driving experience. The implications of these results to pure attention research and driving research are considered...|$|R
