For this pur- pose she defines the key terms: rural area and social capital, and presents the adult education programme “Training for Life Success – Challenges of Rural Areas”. The empirical part is based on a qualitative analysis. The programme “Challenges of Rural Areas (CRA) ” was used as a basis for a comparative analysis of two groups, the participants of the CRA programme and a group consisting of people who did not participate. The analysis revealed certain differences with regard to specific elements of social capital. The greatest difference was observed in connection with social networks and the norms of reciprocity...|$|E

This study was a description of an example of successful <b>informal</b> <b>adult</b> <b>education,</b> National Public Radio's "All Things Considered" (ATC). The study had two purposes: to describe the agenda set by ATC for its listeners, in the sense that what is broadcast on the news becomes what is important and placed on the agenda for public discussion and debate; and to ascertain to what extent the program incorporated principles of adult learning theory. A content analysis was conducted on 25 randomly selected ATC broadcasts from 1974 to 1983. The following conclusions were drawn with regard to the agenda-setting function of news: a listener to ATC would find legal and political affairs, international affairs, and science, environment, and health the issues highest on the public agenda. The issues of social welfare and education were remarkably low on the agenda. Stories were also coded for such things as source of origin, favorability of treatment, and story type. With regard to the study of adult learning, the following conclusions were drawn: ATC would help adults satisfy their needs to avoid obsolescence and perform their civic and social responsibilities; ATC would also give them information which would help them successfully achieve their developmental tasks; ATC incorporated several production techniques which serve to involve the adult in the learning process...|$|E
40|$|To {{understand}} the Australian Breastfeeding Association’s approach to adult {{education and the}} educational practices it introduced into maternal education in Australia in the period 1964 - 2009, {{it is useful to}} consider adult education generally and maternal education specifically during the twentieth century. Most of what passes for education of mothers is <b>informal</b> <b>adult</b> <b>education.</b> One view is that mothers require expert instruction and supervision with regulation of feeding to ensure their babies survive. The opposite view is that mothers should receive no formal instruction at all about being mothers: breastfeeding and caring for babies are, in this view, instinctive activities. However, the Association’s approach has featured autonomous learners with volunteer facilitators in informal settings. One theory that assists particularly in understanding the educational model used by the Association is the humanistic theory of adult education. Another theory relevant to maternal education is a heutagogical approach to adult education, advocated by radical adult education theorists. To {{understand the}} Association’s educational approach, it is necessary to establish the core principles of the education provided to mothers by the Association. The archival research has demonstrated an understanding of the Association’s approach to maternal education. The primary feature of the approach is mother to mother learning. The findings of this paper will increase knowledge of how adults are educated and contribute to understanding of adult education, particularly maternal education. There will be implications for education of mothers and perhaps of women generally which will be of interest to those involved in adult education...|$|E

The constant increase and renewal {{of knowledge and}} the learning and refining of practice skills are necessitated by {{the rate at which}} knowledge is generated in the twentieth century as well as rapid societal changes. At the same time the profession faces new demands, particularly those which are relevant to accountability, while social work aspirations towards professional status are sustained. Continuing education has {{for a very long time}} been an acknowledged and established component of social workers' activities, yet up till now, very little research has been done on this particular subject. In this study,· the following aspects of continuing education in Social Work are explored: it's principles and aims, the provision of training opportunities by educational institutions in South Africa and social workers' motivation for, participation in, and needs regarding continuing education.

The present study, based on participatory action research methodology, was conducted in Egypt where 11 adult female literacy classes, five (139 subjects) in Cairo (urban) and six (151 subjects) in Menia (Upper Egypt/Northern Egypt) were group‐interviewed. The results of the group interviews clearly define the functional context of adult female illiteracy (i. e. age and immediate linguistic/literacy needs) and enforce a diglossic dichotomy, entailing ‘reading’ and ‘writing’ categories. If considered by literacy authorities, diglossic integration in adult literacy programmes/curricula will certainly help Egyptian illiterate adult women to integrate easily in their environment, the ultimate goal of all involved in the fight against adult illiteracy in the Arab world.

Initially, it was found that despite the growing interest in these kinds of museum activities, the available research body is not systematized. It was found that brief reviews of the problem’s historiography are present mostly in preambles of museology, pedagogy, museums history articles. They are often related to the topic indirectly. Attempts to study purposefully the subject are now rare, although their aim is to summarize the existing Ukrainian experience. It was determined that, although it is impossible now to determine the museum andragogics as a separate sphere of knowledge {{on the basis of a}} small number of published investigations of Ukrainian specialists. These investigations are reflecting the national museums and available foreign publications’ experience in this sphere (translated into Ukrainian or published in Russian). But the formation of the andragogics in Ukraine is actual and necessary on the way towards the integration into the global cultural space. Summarizing the material the conclusion was made that the museum andragogics and non-formal adult education in museums are promising areas of scientific knowledge. A contribution of the museum’s and other Ukrainian connected sectors professionals in the process by years 2012 - 13 is notable both at the level of the foreign experience’s study and the reflection in practice, research, scientific and popular publications. However, until now there was no such activity surge, as it happened in the spheres of museum marketing or sociology. Such forms of activity as «Workshop», «Summer school», public lecture are not known and used enough by domestic museums, and therefore by the audience. There is no clear understanding of the problem’s thesaurus. The participation in the international action «Days of Adult Education» is minimal, therefore the museums still cannot be called adult education providers. However, it is still possible to identify and to characterize certain significant stages of the formation of the andragogics, informal museums adult education, historiography’s indexes names, draft law documents and practice activity centres’ compilation. There exists the mutual dependence and connection between museum andragogics, which is in the process of institutionalization, and pedagogy, sociology and other sciences about man, its interdisciplinary nature...|$|E

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) In {{the fields}} of formal and <b>informal</b> online <b>adult</b> <b>education,</b> {{the absence of a}} social context for {{instruction}} has been found to present significant limitations for learner persistence and retention. In the field of online psychoeducational intervention, self-administered and self-paced individualized prevention programs have been developed for delivery to large populations of anonymous users. These delivery models provide limited social context for instructional activities, {{due in part to the}} anonymity of their participants. When social interaction is included in their prevention programs through voluntary, asynchronous self-help/mutual aid discussion forums, anonymity may still limit social interaction, in favor of observational learning advantages for self-efficacy appraisals derived from "lurking". When these large-group models have been applied to online psychoeducation intervention programs for the purposes of encouraging mutual aid, interactive participation has been limited. This mixed methods study focused on a model for the design of an online small group psychoeducational intervention that integrated individual and social learning in a parent management training program. Self-paced participation was replaced with facilitator-led participation in an asynchronous discussion forum where topics were prioritized and sequenced with learning content from individual web-based training modules. Social interaction was facilitated through online problem-based learning discussion group. Despite assertions that interactive participation in online psychoeducational discussion forums may only be accomplished once a subscriber threshold of several hundred participants has been reached, this study found that small group participation through the program's integrated design resulted large effects for increases in parent self-agency and reduction of over-reactive, coercive parenting behaviors. Participation in the online problem-based group discussion forum was found to have contributed to participant outcomes when posting characteristics revealed the presence of both mutual aid processes and the application of individual learning module content...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} research is to consider the environmental knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors, of adults in Minnesota, and possible factors that influence environmental literacy. Specifically, this study is designed to: (1) measure the environmental literacy of Minnesota adults, (2) explore possible relationships between Minnesota adults' environmental literacy variables and their demographic, non-formal and informal learning, and (3) determine the relative contribution of demographic and learning variables for predicting environmental knowledge, attitudes and behaviors. This research was accomplished by conducting a secondary data analysis of The Third Minnesota Report Card on Environmental Literacy: A Survey of Adult Environmental Knowledge, Attitudes and Behavior (Murphy & Olson, 2008). Phone interviews were completed between August and November 2007 with one thousand adults throughout Minnesota. Findings indicated that for age, education, and income, there was a weak positive relationship with environmental knowledge, attitude and behavior scores. There was a significant effect for gender and environmental knowledge scores, with males receiving higher environmental knowledge scores than females. There was a significant effect for gender and environmental attitudes, and behavior scores as well, with females receiving slightly higher environmental attitude and behavior scores than males. After controlling for the effects of demographic variables on environmental knowledge, attitudes and behaviors, non-formal learning participation appears to be a moderate contributor to both environmental knowledge and environmental behaviors. After controlling for the effects of demographic variables on environmental knowledge, attitudes and behaviors, informal learning participation appears to be a slight contributor to environmental attitudes, and a moderate contributor to environmental knowledge and behaviors. Overall, {{the results of this study}} suggest that participation in non-formal and informal education venues improved environmental knowledge, attitude and behavior models, providing evidence for the value and need for non-formal and <b>informal</b> environmental <b>adult</b> <b>education</b> venues...|$|R
