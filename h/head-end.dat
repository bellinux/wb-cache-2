5|$|Amtrak ordered 26 E60s in 1973; 15 on March 26, 1973, and {{a further}} 11 on October 12. The {{total cost of}} the order was $18.4 million. The initial order was for 15 {{locomotives}} with steam generators and 11 with <b>head-end</b> power, but 9 of the first type were switched to using <b>head-end</b> power as Amtrak ramped up acquisition of Amfleet cars. Amtrak anticipated that E60-hauled Amfleet trains could displace both the GG1s and the mechanically-unreliable Metroliners.|$|E
5|$|Originally, Budd {{built the}} Hi-Levels with steam heating. When Amtrak began {{converting}} its inherited fleet to <b>head-end</b> power in 1970s, the Santa Fe handled {{the conversion of}} the Hi-Levels in its Topeka, Kansas, shops. Of the 73 Hi-Levels, all but three underwent the conversion.|$|E
5|$|The {{turbines}} {{were designed}} to operate at 12,500 rpm and were paired with a generator set with a 10:1 reduction gearing. A twin-armature DC generator was used to power the traction motors, while a three-phase, 220-volt AC generator provided auxiliary functions such as powering the traction motor blowers and providing <b>head-end</b> power; the latter, which was used to provide lighting, heating, and air conditioning to passenger cars, was incredibly unusual in 1939 and would not become standard until the 1970s.|$|E

5|$|For {{passenger}} {{service the}} F40PH has another electrical alternator, the <b>head-end</b> generator. The HEP unit generates three-phase AC power at 480 V (500kW {{on the first}} order, 800kW on later units) for lighting, heating and air-conditioning the train. Originally, F40PHs powered the HEP alternator from the prime mover; from the head end to the train must be a constant frequency, and the prime mover had to turn at a constant 893 RPM while supplying head end power (even standing still, with the throttle in idle). Power to the traction motors was controlled by varying the field excitation of the main (traction) generator. On some later versions of the F40PH (and on many rebuilt F40s), a second small diesel engine {{at the rear of}} the locomotive powers the HEP alternator. In these engines, the prime-mover speed varies in the usual way; they can be identified by the diesel exhaust {{at the rear of the}} locomotive and by their quiet idle. Remaining F40s, with the constant-RPM prime movers, are noticeably louder.|$|E
25|$|Why {{the freight}} train failed to stop was unclear. A wrong-side signal problem was eliminated, leaving human error {{as the only}} {{possible}} cause. However, since the <b>head-end</b> crew of the freight train did not survive, {{it was not clear}} why they had erred. Enough of their remains were found that testing was able to rule out drugs or alcohol as the cause, though it was revealed that the engineer, Jack Hudson, was an alcoholic and heavy smoker suffering from pancreatitis and type 2 diabetes, thus placing him at risk for a heart attack or stroke.|$|E
25|$|USRA Light Mikados (Maine Central class S) handled freight trains on the Mountain Division {{after the}} last Mallet was retired in 1931; and class O 4-6-0s handled local trains and (often in tandem) {{provided}} helper service. EMD F3s and GP7s replaced steam locomotives in 1953. Four or five diesel locomotives were typical <b>head-end</b> power for diesel-era freight trains; {{and a pair of}} EMD SW7s or non-dynamic-braked GP7s often provided helper service westbound. First generation diesels were replaced by similar numbers of EMD GP38s, ten GE U18Bs and two ALCO RS-11s. Helpers were less common with these second generation diesels.|$|E

25|$|Like {{most other}} {{commuter}} rail systems in North America, all trains are operated with a cab car {{from which the}} engineer can control the train. The cab car is typically {{at the head of}} trains traveling toward Washington to keep diesel fumes away from the terminal. To accommodate elevation gains, the locomotive is at the head of trains heading away from Washington. In the early 2000s a single unpowered EMD F cab unit, #7100 (ex-Baltimore & Ohio Railroad F7 #4553), occasionally substituted for a cab car. In addition to serving as a Non-Powered Control Unit, the unit is also outfitted with a <b>head-end</b> power generator to supply electricity to the train.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1st century BC or early 1st century AD a new design {{appeared}} in some bow type fibulae. A separate pin {{was attached to}} the <b>head-end</b> of the bow with a small hinge. In {{the second half of the}} 1st century AD, hinges were introduced to plate type fibulae. One or two small plaques were cast on the back of the plate and a pin {{was attached to the}}m by a small hinge. Previously, plate type fibulae had bilateral springs attached to the back. In the 3rd century AD, the hinge was placed in the centre of a long transverse bar creating the famous crossbow fibula design. A few fibulae from a much earlier date also had hinges, although this design feature was very rare and soon died out for nearly five centuries. For example, the Asia Minor Decorated Arc Fibula (Blinkenberg Type XII Variation 16) dating to the 5th century BC.|$|E

50|$|Com21 {{was another}} early pioneer in cable modems, and quite {{successful}} until proprietary systems were made obsolete by the DOCSIS standardization. The Com21 system used a ComController as central bridge in CATV network <b>head-ends,</b> the ComPort cable modem in various models and the NMAPS management system using HP OpenView as platform. Later they also introduced a return path multiplexer to overcome noise problems when combining return path signals from multiple areas. The proprietary protocol {{was based on}} Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). The central ComController switch was a modular system offering one downstream channel (transmitter) and one management module. The remaining slots {{could be used for}} upstream receivers (2 per card), dual Ethernet 10BaseT and later also Fast-Ethernet and ATM interfaces. The ATM interface became the most popular, as it supported the increasing bandwidth demands and also supported VLANs.Com21 developed a DOCSIS modem, but the company filed for bankruptcy in 2003 and closed. The DOCSIS CMTS assets of COM21 were acquired by ARRIS.|$|R

500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s Amtrak's {{passenger}} car fleet was still steam-heated; Amtrak's requirement called for two steam generators. These were {{located at the}} rear of the locomotive. Forward of the generators was a [...] water tank. Critically, this tank rested above the carbody; the lateral motion of the water within would later be implicated in a string of derailments. The primary underbody tank was split between water and diesel fuel, carrying [...] of water and [...] of diesel. Provision was made for eventual conversion to <b>head-end</b> power (HEP), but it was never carried out.|$|E
500|$|The Superliners {{resembled the}} Hi-Levels but {{differed}} in several ways. The most obvious difference was the height: at [...] the Superliners were [...] taller. The Superliners also used 480-volt <b>head-end</b> power (HEP), which Amtrak had just adopted as its standard, instead of steam heating. The Hi-Levels, which used steam heating and diesel generators, would {{be converted to}} match this standard. HEP was more reliable than steam, especially in cold weather. Initially the cars could not be worked east of Chicago because of limited overhead clearances, but by the 1980s many eastern railroads had raised clearances on their tracks to permit tri-level auto carriers and double-stack container trains, which also permitted {{the operation of the}} Superliners. Tunnel clearances around New York City and elsewhere prevent their use on the Northeast Corridor.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the past}} thirty years, cable and {{satellite}} television have come to provide most homes with dozens or even hundreds of television services. Cable television was originally created to allow residents of weak-signal areas to benefit from a large, well-located common antenna. In the 1970s, Premium Services such as HBO, Showtime, and The Movie Channel used satellites to deliver movies to cable <b>head-ends,</b> who would re-distribute it to customers for an added charge. During the same period, it has seen the emergence of numerous specialty cable networks, such as CBN (now ABC Family), CNN, ESPN (sports), Lifetime (women's programming), The Learning Channel, MTV, Nickelodeon (children's shows), VH-1, The Weather Channel, and others. The advent of digital compression technology in the 1990s, along with the rapidly growing popularity of direct-to-home satellite television allowed for content providers to pack more channels into a single satellite slot, {{and a number of}} new networks, especially those fulfilling certain niches, aimed at digital cable and satellite systems were established.|$|R

5000|$|There are two {{modifications}} of Viaccess PC2.3 in use. The first, known as TPS Crypt, {{is used by}} TPS. Despite being compromised also, the TPS Crypt system has been further modified to utilise Advanced Encryption System (AES) keys. These AES keys were originally updated once weekly, however after this inconvenienced unauthorised viewers little, a second TPS crypt system was introduced, by which keys are changed every 12 minutes, with keys being sent over TPS's internal Open TV system. This therefore meant that only TPS receivers could receive the new AES key, and not the insecure TPS subscription cards. Monitoring and analysing of the keys by hacking groups, however, has brought about key lists, where the AES keys have been successfully predicted. Implementation of this procedure of automatically updating keys has proved difficult, if not impossible, to implement on many satellite receivers, rendering the TPS Crypt AES system a general success. The second Viaccess modification, called ThalesCrypt, is used by Canal Satellite France to protect its contents on the transport network to the <b>head-ends</b> of the cable networks; it is an over-encryption mechanism of the original protocol encryption keys.|$|R

500|$|Amtrak's {{first choice}} for Superliner {{assignments}} {{had been the}} financially-troubled Floridian, a Chicago–Florida long-distance train, but the two years' delay in delivery scuppered these plans. Amtrak turned next to the Empire Builder. This long-distance train ran between Chicago and Seattle through the plains of Montana and North Dakota. Winters {{in that part of}} the United States are harsh, featuring both blizzards and cold temperatures. Traditional steam-heated equipment often broke down, causing Amtrak to cancel service. The Superliners, with their electrical <b>head-end</b> power, were far better suited for the conditions. The Empire Builder became the first long-distance train to use Superliners, and the first train permanently assigned them, on October 28, 1979. Amtrak's new national timetable depicted a Superliner coach on the front cover, and the listing for the Empire Builder carried a heading which read [...] "Amtrak's Superliner is [...] Special." [...] At the same time, Superliners entered service on the short-haul Pacific International and Mount Rainier in the Pacific Northwest.|$|E

2500|$|Building on {{mechanical}} {{developments in}} the 1970s, [...] high speed Washington-New York Metroliner Service was improved with new equipment and faster schedules. Travel time between New York and Washington D.C was reduced to under 3 hours. According to the 1980 Amtrak Annual Report, a converted 12-car set saved the company approximately $250,000 a year in fuel, maintenance and yard support costs. Amtrak completed the <b>head-end</b> power conversion program in 1982.

2500|$|A combine is a {{car that}} {{combines}} features of a <b>head-end</b> and a regular passenger car. [...] The most common combination {{is that of a}} coach and a baggage car, but the combination of coach and post office car was also common. [...] Combines were used most frequently on branch lines and short line railroads where there wasn't necessarily enough traffic to economically justify single-purpose cars.

2500|$|The SD70MAC (colloquially {{known as}} a [...] "Mac" [...] or a [...] "70 Mac") {{is very similar to}} the SD70M and SD70I; the main {{difference}} being that the SD70MAC uses AC traction motors. Production of the model commenced in 1993, competing against GE's AC4400CW. AC motors, while simpler and more reliable than DC motors, require expensive inverters to generate a variable-frequency AC signal, raising the locomotive's purchase cost substantially. The majority of SD70MAC models were produced with the [...] EMD 710 prime mover while later units are rated at [...] and feature EMD SD45-style flared radiators.

2500|$|The {{ability to}} couple diesel–electric {{locomotives}} in an MU fashion {{was first introduced}} in the EMD FT four-unit demonstrator that toured the United States in 1939. At the time, American railroad work rules required that each operating locomotive in a train had to have on board a full crew. EMD circumvented that requirement by coupling the individual units of the demonstrator with drawbars instead of conventional knuckle couplers and declaring the combination to be a single locomotive. [...] Electrical interconnections were made so one engine driver could operate the entire consist from the <b>head-end</b> unit. [...] Later on, work rules were amended and the semi-permanent coupling of units with drawbars was eliminated in favour of couplers, as servicing had proved to be somewhat cumbersome owing to the total length of the consist (about 200 feet or nearly 61 meters).|$|E
2500|$|From 1982 to 1984, Tokyu Car built 45 of a heavily-specialized, meter-gauge RDC {{design for}} the Taiwan Railway Administration under license from Budd.

[...] Unlike other RDC sets, however, the trailer's diesel engine is used exclusively to provide <b>head-end</b> power for the entire 3-car set, while the engines in the driver car are used for propulsion. [...] To prevent dependency on the trailer's engine for cooling, the cooling fans of the driver cars are driven hydraulically instead of electrically.
