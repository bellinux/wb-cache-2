5|$|During {{the first}} week of September, a cold front moved off the East Coast of the United States and stalled over the Atlantic Ocean. By September 8, a weak <b>frontal</b> <b>wave</b> began {{developing}} along the cold front. Late on September 9, convection increased over the broad low pressure area, and the overall system intensified beneath an upper-level low. Subsequently, the system abandoned its frontal features as its appearance became more circular. With persistent but limited convection near and {{to the west of the}} center, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) estimated the system developed into a subtropical depression late on September 10 about 375mi (604km) west-southwest of Bermuda; it was considered subtropical because the upper-circulation was believed to have been cold-core. Operationally, advisories on the system were not initiated until 21hours later.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{undertake}} {{a detailed analysis}} of linear stability of geostrophically balanced double density fronts in the framework of the two-layer rotating shallow-water model on the f-plane with topography, the latter being represented by an escarpment beneath the fronts. We use the pseudospectral collocation method to identify and quantify different kinds of instabilities resulting from phase locking and resonances of frontal, Rossby, Poincare and topographic waves. A swap in the leading long-wave instability from the classical barotropic form, resulting from the resonance of two <b>frontal</b> <b>waves,</b> to a baroclinic form, resulting from the resonance of Rossby and <b>frontal</b> <b>waves,</b> takes place with decreasing depth of the lower layer. Nonlinear development and saturation of these instabilities, and of an instability of topographic origin, resulting from the resonance of <b>frontal</b> and topographic <b>waves,</b> are studied and compared {{with the help of a}} new-generation well-balanced finite-volume code for multilayer rotating shallow-water equations. The results of the saturation for different instabilities are shown to produce very different secondary coherent structures. The influence of the topography on these processes is highlighted...|$|R
40|$|The ambient {{conditions}} during cyclogenesis on fronts in the North Atlantic (NA) are characterised climatologically in the ERA-Interim dataset. These ‘secondary’ cyclones, which grow from <b>frontal</b> <b>waves,</b> are typically small in scale, shallow and deepen rapidly, and pose {{a challenge to}} forecasters and numerical weather prediction models. Frontal-wave development has been studied intensively in the past based on observations (e. g. FASTEX), real-case studies or analytical models. In this study, frontal-wave cyclogenesis is studied from a climatological perspective and is detected {{by a combination of}} two automated identification methods for the period between 1979 and 2014. A climatology of frontal-wave cyclogenesis is presented. Horizontal composites provide an estimate of the climatological mean of conditions during frontal-wave cyclogenesis which may prove useful in the assessment of the realism of proposed idealized models of frontogenesis. The findings are also compared with assumptions made in earlier idealized studies of <b>frontal</b> <b>waves.</b> The composites reveal coherent structures of diabatically generated low-level PV in the lower troposphere, neutral moist static stability at cyclogenesis and an ambient lower troposphere close to saturation. The vertical PV structure in the east NA is more vertically aligned than in the west NA and PV anomalies from the upper and lower levels reach deeper into the mid-troposphere, which indicates an enhanced phase-lock between the two anomalies. Previous studies suggest the existence of an upper limit of along-frontal stretching above which frontal-wave development is strongly suppressed. The presented multi-decadal analysis confirms its existence in a range between 0. 6 and 0. 8 × 10 − 5 s− 1. Finally a climatology of along-frontal stretching for the NA is presented and compared to the fraction of cyclogenesis forming on <b>frontal</b> <b>waves...</b>|$|R

40|$|During late autumn {{through early}} spring, extratropical regions on Mars exhibit {{profound}} mean zonal equator-to-pole thermal contrasts. The imposition of this strong meridional temperature variation supports intense eastward-traveling, synoptic weather systems (i. e., transient baroclinic/barotropic waves) within Mars' extratropical atmosphere. Such disturbances grow, mature and decay within the east-west varying seasonal-mean midlatitude jet stream (i. e., the polar vortex) on the planet. Near the surface, the weather disturbances indicated large-scale spiraling "comma"-shaped dust cloud structures and scimitar-shaped dust fronts, indicative of processes associated with cyclo-/fronto-genesis. The weather systems occur during specific seasons on Mars, {{and in both}} hemispheres. The northern hemisphere (NH) disturbances are significantly more intense {{than their counterparts in}} the southern hemisphere (SH). Further, the NH weather systems and accompanying <b>frontal</b> <b>waves</b> appear to have significant impacts on the transport of tracer fields (e. g., particularly dust and to some extent water species (vapor/ice) as well). And regarding dust, <b>frontal</b> <b>waves</b> appear to be key agents in the lifting, lofting, organization and transport of this particular atmospheric aerosol. In this paper, a brief background and supporting observations of Mars' extratropical weather systems is presented. This is followed by a short review of the theory and various modeling studies (i. e., ranging from highly simplified, mechanistic and full global circulation modeling investigations) which have been pursued. Finally, a discussion of outstanding issues and questions regarding the character and nature of Mars' extratropical traveling weather systems is offered...|$|R

40|$|It {{is known}} that {{somatosensory}} evoked potentials can be influenced by several centripetal and centrifugal factors which modify their amplitude. The present study shows {{for the first time}} that the <b>frontal</b> <b>waves</b> N 30 and to a lesser extent N 23 are specifically attenuated during mental movement simulation (MMS) activity. This gating phenomenon, tested on 16 normal subjects, occurred when repeated fast finger movements on the stimulated side are mentally simulated.

40|$|Between late autumn {{and early}} spring, {{middle and high}} latitudes on Mars exhibit strong equatortopole mean {{temperature}} contrasts (i. e., "baroclinicity"). Data collected during the Viking era and observations from both the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) indicate that this strong baroclinicity supports vigorous, large-scale eastward traveling weather systems (i. e., transient synoptic periodwaves) [1, 2]. For a rapidly rotating, differentially heated, shallow atmosphere such as on Earth and Mars, these large-scale, extratropical weather disturbances are critical components of the global circulation. The wavelike disturbances act as agents in the transport of heat and momentum between low and high latitudes of the planet. Through cyclonic/anticyclonic winds, intense shear deformations, contractions-dilatations in temperature and density, and sharp perturbations amongst atmospheric tracers (i. e., dust, volatiles (e. g., water vapor) and condensates (e. g., water-ice cloud particles)), Mars extratropical weather systems have significant subsynoptic scale ramifications by supporting atmospheric <b>frontal</b> <b>waves</b> (Fig. 1) ...|$|R

500|$|Similar to a Subtropical Depression 13 in April 2000, {{there was}} an unusual {{subtropical}} cyclone that formed in June to end the season. A trough exited South Africa on June18 with an associated <b>frontal</b> <b>wave</b> in the southern Mozambique Channel. On the next day, the system separated from the front and became a cut-off low. It moved north-northwestward along the eastern periphery of a ridge in southern Africa, becoming a subtropical depression on June20. The associated convection initially diminished, although the thunderstorms redeveloped due to the atmospheric instability in the region. On June21, the depression passed about 100km (60mi) east of Maputo, Mozambique, while moving into an area of much warmer waters. As such, the structure became more tropical, with a small central dense overcast forming over the circulation only 75km (45mi) in diameter. The JTWC initiated advisories on June21 as Tropical Cyclone 12S. The small size of the storm merited the MFR calling it a [...] "midget cyclone", with a small eye forming late on June21. Based on the feature, the JTWC estimated peak 1winds of 120km/h (75mph); in contrast, the MFR estimated 10minute winds of 95km/h (60mph). Despite the structure, the convection was shallow, which brought uncertainty to the true intensity of the storm. Turning to the northeast and east, the subtropical storm rapidly weakened on June22 to depression status after the environment became hostile, and the convection largely dissipated. The exposed low turned northwestward on June23, dissipating the next day.|$|E

Methods: Healthy male participants were administered 20 % (n = 8) or 40 % (n = 8) N 2 O while having high-density (modified 10 - 20) noise minimized EEG recordings. Results: Nitrous oxide was found to produce clear reductions in resting total power, particularly at frontal-vertex sites.
