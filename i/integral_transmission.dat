40|$|We {{present a}} {{comparison}} between the performance of solvers based on Nyström discretizations of several well-posed boundary integral equation formulations of Helmholtz transmission problems in two-dimensional Lipschitz domains. Specifically, {{we focus on the}} following four classes of boundary integral formulations of Helmholtz transmission problems (1) the classical first kind <b>integral</b> equations for <b>transmission</b> problems, (2) the classical second kind <b>integral</b> equations for <b>transmission</b> problems, (3) the single integral equation formulations, and (4) certain direct counterparts of recently introduced Generalized Combined Source Integral Equations. The former two formulations were the only formulations whose well-posedness in Lipschitz domains was rigorously established. We establish the well-posedness of the latter two formulations in appropriate functional spaces of boundary traces of solutions of transmission Helmholtz problems in Lipschitz domains. We give ample numerical evidence that Nyström solvers based on formulations (3) and (4) are computationally more advantageous than solvers based on the classical formulations (1) and (2), {{especially in the case of}} high-contrast transmission problems at high frequencies.

In this paper, we are focusing on the possibility to use the pulsed white neutron time-of-flight facility GELINA to perform this kind of measurement. Several issues need to be addressed: neutron source intensity, room return effect, distance of the materials to be irradiated from the source, and the sensitivity of various reaction rate distributions through the material to different input cross sections. MCNP 6 and TRIPOLI 4 calculations of the outgoing neutron spectrum are compared, based on electron/positron/gamma/neutron simulations. A first guess of an <b>integral</b> <b>transmission</b> experiment through a 238 U slab is considered.

40|$|Neutron Resonance Transmission Analysis (NRTA) is an {{analytical}} technique that uses neutrons to assay the isotopic content of bulk materials. The technique uses a pulsed accelerator {{to produce an}} intense, short pulse of neutrons in a time-of-flight configuration. These neutrons, traveling at different speeds according to their energy, {{can be used to}} interrogate a spent fuel (SF) assembly to determine its plutonium content. Neutron transmission through the assembly is monitored as a function of neutron energy (time after the pulse), similar to the way neutron cross-section data is often collected. The transmitted neutron intensity is recorded as a function of time, with faster (higher-energy) neutrons arriving first and slower (lower-energy) neutrons arriving later. The low-energy elastic scattering and absorption resonances of plutonium and other isotopes modulate the transmitted neutron spectrum. Plutonium content in SF can be determined by analyzing this attenuation. Work is currently underway at Idaho National Laboratory, as a part of United States Department of Energy's Next Generation Safeguards Initiative (NGSI), to investigate the NRTA technique and to assess its feasibility for quantifying the plutonium content in SF and for determining the diversion of SF pins from assemblies. Preliminary results indicate that NRTA has great potential for being able to assay intact SF assemblies. Operating in the 1 - 40 eV range, it can identify four plutonium isotopes (239, 240, 241, & 242 Pu), three uranium isotopes (235, 236, & 238 U), and six resonant fission products (99 Tc, 103 Rh, 131 Xe, 133 Cs, 145 Nd, and 152 Sm). It can determine the areal density or mass of these isotopes in single- or multiple-pin <b>integral</b> <b>transmission</b> scans. Further, multiple observables exist to allow the detection of material diversion (pin defects) including fast-neutron and x-ray radiography, gross-transmission neutron counting, plutonium resonance absorption analysis, and fission-product resonance absorption analysis.

We use noncontact atomic force microscopy, which achieves near cryo-electron microscope resolution, to reveal the structural details of protein–DNA compaction intermediates.

Specifically, we perform the stability analysis of Nyström discretizations of (1) the classical second kind <b>integral</b> equations for <b>transmission</b> problems [KressRoach, 1978], (2) the single integral equation formulations [Kleinman & Martin, 1988], and (3) recently introduced Generalized Combined Source Integral Equations [Boubendir,Bruno, Levadoux and.

The Nyström method that we use for the discretization of the various integral equations under consideration are based on global trigonometric approximations, splitting of the kernels of integral operators into singular and smooth components, and explicit quadratures of products of singular parts (logarithms) and trigonometric polynomials. The discretization of the integral equations (2) and (3) above requires special care as these formulations feature compositions of boundary integral operators that are pseudodifferential operators {{of positive and negative}} orders respectively. We deal with these compositions through Calderon's calculus and we establish the convergence of fully discrete Nyström methods in appropriate Sobolev spaces which implies pointwise convergence of the discrete solutions.

In a deregulated electricity market, not only does transmission planning have to address technical requirements but also has to consider commercial issues linked to an electricity market. One of the prime goals of transmission planning is to ensure a fair distribution of economic benefits among the market participants (all those who produce, transmit and consume). These economic benefits attributable to a transmission interconnection generally appear as benefits to an electricity market and are referred to as market benefits. Even from a regulatory perspective, assessment of market benefits of a transmission interconnection is an essential requirement to ascertain its economic value. The market benefit assessment of a transmission interconnector presented in this thesis is specific to the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) consistent with the regulatory framework in the NEM. This thesis develops a market benefit assessment framework in accordance with Regulatory Investment Test for Transmission (RIT-T) to assess the economic significance of Basslink, one of six inter-regional transmission interconnectors in the Australian NEM.

This study aims to determine how such a stiffness gradient across the calcified cartilage and bone changes with joint degeneration and how different scalar levels of testing are correlated. MethodUsing a bovine model of early osteoarthritis (OA), multiple samples of calcified cartilage on subchondral bone (SB) from sixteen bovine patellae, displaying a range of cartilage states from intact (healthy) to moderately degenerate, were tested using macroscopic three-point bending, microhardness indentation, and nanoindentation. Mechanical properties were correlated to cartilage health and microstructural morphometric measurements obtained from high resolution imaging using Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) Microscopy. ResultsThere was a significant decrease in the moduli obtained from tests done at increasing scalar levels. The macroscale average modulus obtained from three-point bending showed that the SB was 10 times stiffer than the calcified cartilage in healthy tissue, 5 times in tissue displaying mildly degenerate AC and 8 times with moderate degeneration. Microhardness testing of multiple points from the calcified cartilage to the SB revealed that there was a monotonic gradual increase in the mean modulus. The moduli obtained from nanoindentation testing indicated that the SB was about twice the stiffness of the calcified cartilage. ConclusionThe mechanical transition from calcified cartilage to SB involves a graded continuum of increasing material stiffness.

The simulation accounts for radiation dose distributions in tissue produced by fast neutrons and by neutron capture reaction products such as gamma rays, C -particles, protons, and heavy particles. These techniques are applied to optimize {{the effectiveness of the}} M. I. T. Reactor Medical Therapy Facility through a survey of the effects of neutron filters and of modifications to the beam collimation system. Neutron beams reflected from thin slabs of hydrogenous materials are shown to have an improved ability to effectively irradiate a deep tumor without destroying normal tissue above it because relatively few fast neutrons are reflected. Considerable improvements in thermal neutron distribution in tissue are shown to result from surrounding the head with a neutron-reflecting annulus to reduce lateral neutron leakage. A new numerical solution is obtained for the problem of neutron transport in finite thickness slabs with isotropic scattering. Gaussian quadratures are used to evaluate the neutron transport <b>integral</b> equations, yielding <b>transmission,</b> absorption, and reflection probabilities, and fluxes, as a function of collision number. Collision history correlations are devised which use only five paraeters to predict the fate of neutrons incident on an infinite slab having arbitrary thickness and neutron cross sections.

40|$|Oligodendrocytes (OL) s are the {{dominant}} cell {{type in the}} white matter and are <b>integral</b> for synaptic <b>transmission</b> essential for proper neuronal communication between brain areas. Previous {{studies have shown that}} intravenous administration of the mononuclear fraction of human umbilical cord blood (HUCB) cells in rat models of stroke reduced white matter injury, gray matter injury and behavioral deficits. Yet the mechanisms used by HUCB cells remain unknown in ischemic injury. These studies will investigate both in vitro and in vivo approaches to elucidate this mechanism in OLs. When mature primary OLs were coincubated with HUCB cells, HUCB cells secreted soluble factors that reduced cell death in OLs exposed to OGD. Microarray analysis revealed that HUCB cell treatment induced OL gene changes. These changes included genes involved in cell proliferation, signaling, anti-oxidant activity, and myelination. To extend these findings, the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was used to assess the expression profile of protein products of gene changes observed in vitro. The in vivo data mirrored in vitro data in that metallothionein 3 (Mt 3), peroxiredoxin 4 (Prdx 4), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (Mog), U 2 AF homology kinase 1 (Uhmk 1), and insulin induce gene 1 (Insig 1) were upregulated in OLs of the white matter tract adjacent to the infarct. Furthermore, double immunofluorescence staining determined that OLs expressed these proteins. Other reports have shown that HUCB cells secrete soluble factors related to cellular protection, including interleukin 6 (IL- 6), interleukin 8 (IL- 8), and interleukin 10 (IL- 10). Other factors are known for their proliferative actions, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), BDNF, platelet derived growth factor B (PDGF-B), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF) all of which converge on the Akt survival pathway. Given these findings we hypothesize that Akt activation is integral to HUCB cell mediated OL protection. In models of excitotoxicity, the addition of Akt inhibitor IV blocked HUCB cell mediated protection in OL cultures exposed to 24 hrs OGD. In vivo, HUCB cell treatment increased Akt activation, antioxidant protein expression and decreased caspase 3 cleavage in the external capsule in a time dependent manner. The next series of experiments determine whether the soluble factors secreted by HUCB cells could replace HUCB cells as treatment. LIF expression is increased in HUCB cells as compared to peripheral blood and as previously mentioned, LIF is secreted by HUCB cells. Additionally, LIF rescued OLs from spinal cord and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis injury. Thus LIF was investigated. LIF protected OL subjected to 24 hr OGD, increased antioxidant Prdx 4 gene expression and reduced reactive oxygen species production. Additionally the inclusion of Akt inhibitor IV blocked LIF induced OL protection. Similar results were obtained when GCSF was evaluated. All these findings indicate that HUCB cell mediated OL/white matter protection is due to the soluble factors secreted by the mononuclear population of these cells. These soluble factors including LIF activate cellular machinery leading to enhanced cellular survival. Here we found a specific survival pathway activated by soluble factors released from HUCB cells, leading to Akt activation. Akt activation arrests stroke induced apoptosis and reduced the expansion of the infarct, promoting functional recovery from acute ischemic injury...|$|R
