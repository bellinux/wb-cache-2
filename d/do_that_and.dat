5|$|Early in {{his final}} year on campus, Middleton was once again pressed by the {{university}} president to retire from the army {{and go to work}} for the college. Again, Middleton could not <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> began looking for a suitable follow-on assignment. Not having been overseas in over sixteen years, he put in a request for duty in the Philippines. He finished his tenure at LSU in the summer of 1936, having overseen the increase in students completing the ROTC program from about 500 to over 1700 cadets.|$|E

In pro ball, you <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> you'll wear out, because you play every single day.|$|E
5|$|I don't see {{the point}} of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be {{impossible}} for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's impossible for us to <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> quite frankly I would think of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music. We're not afraid to experiment, or to be caught with our pants down, so to speak. That's what keeps us going.|$|E

25|$|Kitagawa {{was born}} on August 22, 1986 in Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan, and has a younger brother. She grew up in Kobe, and lost many friends in the Great Hanshin {{earthquake}} in 1995. As a child, {{she wanted to be}} a doctor, but by the time she reached high school she was uncertain as to whether she could <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> not sure what to do in the future. At around this time, she was scouted by a talent agency, and she decided to try the entertainment world. Her parents were initially opposed, but they gave their permission, on two conditions: that she give up if she was making no progress within a year, and that she put her studies first and graduate from university. She has kept the second half of the promise, graduating in commercial science from Meiji University in Tokyo in March 2009.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of Telemundo's programming consists of first-run telenovelas and series, {{many of which}} are produced by the network itself through its Telemundo Studios unit; however, some shows broadcasts by the network are produced by outside companies (including Caracol Television and Promofilm). Telemundo's schedule does not incorporate situation comedies, although some comedy series have aired on the network in the past, particularly during the 1990s and early 2000s. Variety shows – a common format in Spanish language television in the U.S. and other countries – have had a limited presence on Telemundo's lineup in recent years; with La Voz Kids being the only such show appearing on the network as of July 2013. Two additional variety series debuted in 2015: Si Se Puede, an adaptation of the Armoza Formats celebrity talent competition franchise I Can <b>Do</b> <b>That,</b> <b>and</b> ¡Qué Noche! con Angelica y Raul ("What a Night! with Angelica and Raul"), a family-oriented series using the traditional Saturday evening variety program model that was created to fill part of the void opened up by the cancellation of Univision's Sabado Gigante.|$|E

500|$|The {{band has}} {{generated}} controversy {{over whether the}} band's musical style and major-label status constitutes [...] "true punk".

One reporter attempted to ask Willis about his opinion on the current government, but was interrupted by Willis in mid-sentence: [...] "I'm sick of answering this fucking question. I'm a Republican only as far as I want a smaller government, I want less government intrusion. I want them to stop shitting on my money and your money and tax dollars that we give 50 percent of every year.

500|$|This {{led to the}} {{building}} of the first council housing estate in Gateshead. Alderman Hodkin laid the foundation stone on 27 October 1920; as work commenced the Alderman demonstrated the authority's concerns, telling the local newspaper that: [...] "we can build houses, but we cannot build homes. Only the people themselves can <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> I hope that the spirit of ‘esprit de corps’ will prevail and this will be a model estate" [...] Demand was highthere were 427 applicants for the first twenty eight houses builtand the council built further tracts of housing in a broad triangle between Sodhouse Bank, Ermine Crescent and The Avenue, although central government withdrew its promised funding. By 1936, most of the social housing available as of 2012 was in existence and provides accommodation to over half {{of the population of the}} suburb.|$|E
500|$|The March 30, 1974, concert {{featured}} an ethnically and age-diverse {{audience that}} included young hippies and old, wealthy attendees.

[...] Although he lived only 15 minutes away, Davis {{arrived at the}} venue {{more than an hour}} late. When the band walked out onstage, he followed with his back turned to the audience, casually strolling onstage while the other musicians were setting up. Davis immediately began to play, and the band responded by playing a dense rhythm in unison. Saxophonist Dave Liebman, writing in the 1997 US reissue liner notes for Dark Magus, recalled the start of the show: [...] "It is his whim [...]. That's the thing!... Miles can <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> have three thousand musicians follow him. Right? So what I learned in that respect from Miles was to be able to watch him and be on his case".|$|E

500|$|Cast member Wil Wheaton rewatched {{the episode}} for AOL TV in November 2006. He criticised {{the writing of}} Fontana in this episode, saying that around this time she {{appeared}} on a panel at a convention about how to solve [...] "The Wesley Problem", but when rewatching the episode he thought that [...] "maybe instead of sitting on this panel and trashing me, D.C Fontana could have written intelligent dialogue for me and helped solve the [...] "Wesley problem" [...] herself. I don't know, maybe she tried to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> didn't {{get a lot of}} support {{from the rest of the}} producers and writing staff, but even I know of Dr. Channing's theory of not writing cliched dialogue for kids in science fiction, and then blaming the actor who is forced to deliver it." [...] Overall he criticised the [...] "very stiff" [...] dialogue throughout the episode, and called the set-up [...] "incredibly forced". He did highlight that Data acting out as Sherlock Holmes laid the foundation of future episodes which would expand on this.|$|E
500|$|The {{release of}} Lizard {{merchandise}} designs along with unconfirmed concept art featuring a humanoid-shape {{with a layer}} of scales on top instead of a pronounced snout (similar to a dinosaur or crocodile) as in the most recent comics, produced a mixed reaction. Many commenters compared it to other fictional characters instead of his rendering in comics. Russ Fischer of /Film described the character as looking more [...] "Steve Ditko derived" [...] (the character's original artist). Webb felt that there are different incarnations of Lizard in the comic book. He felt that he should do it without the snout because he was interested more in human emotions and wanted to keep Rhys' presence in the creature. Webb wanted him to have emotion, have a face and have feeling. He stated [...] "that in a comic book, you just put that thing up there, and you can say, oh, thought bubble, whatever. But when you try to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> make it look real, it's a different challenge, and I'm creating a movie, I'm not creating a comic book. That was part of the design." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{sequences}} where Superman utilizes close-combat fight {{scenes with}} the other Kryptonians {{proved to be a}} major challenge for the filmmakers and the visual effects crew. Desjardin explained, [...] "When we do these fights and these hyper-real things, we don’t want to do the traditional, 'OK I’m a cameraman, I'm shooting a clean plate, I'm going to pan over here to follow the action that’s not really there yet but we'll put the action in later. Because that's us animating the characters to the camera. So we would do that animation with the characters—grappling, punching or flying away—and we would take the real guys up until the point until they were supposed to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> we'd cut. Then we'd put an environment camera there and take the environment. And then a camera for reference of the actors and get each moment. So then we had a set of high-res stills for the environment and the characters. Then, in post, we take the digi-doubles and animate them according to the speeds we want them to move in our digital environment." ...|$|E

500|$|Todd McCarthy of Variety {{wrote that}} Valkyrie [...] "has visual splendor galore, {{but is a}} cold work lacking in the {{requisite}} tension and suspense". McCarthy considered Cruise as [...] "a bit stiff but still adequate" [...] as von Stauffenberg. The critic believed that McQuarrie's script was well-carpentered but felt that compressing and streamlining the events to make a known failed plot more thrilling lacked a [...] "sufficient sizzle into the dialogue or individuality into the characters". McCarthy missed [...] "many of the interesting personal and political nuances pertaining to these men" [...] that were not detailed. He thought that the production design by Lilly Kilvert and Patrick Lumb stood out, that Newton Thomas Sigel's cinematography had a [...] "restrained elegance", and that John Ottman performed well in his dual role as editor and composer. A similar sentiment was stated by Mike LaSalle in the San Francisco Chronicle, who wrote [...] "There's nothing inherently laughable about the spectacle of Tom Cruise with an eye patch and a missing hand, strutting around in a German colonel's uniform. But neither is there anything about him that truly suggests Claus von Stauffenberg, leader of the 1944 conspiracy to decapitate the Nazi government and stage a coup d'etat. Think of Valkyrie as a reasonably entertaining drama about the time Tom Cruise tried to kill Hitler. <b>Do</b> <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> it becomes possible to enjoy the movie.|$|E
500|$|In {{spite of}} conceding two late goals against Chelsea, Arsenal {{won by a}} solitary goal on New Year's Day to {{maintain}} their lead. Two goals from Henry against Birmingham City took his total for the club to 100 goals in all competitions; Wenger declared the display – a 4–0 win, as his team's best since beating Leeds United in September. Henry scored a hat-trick for Arsenal against West Ham United on 19 January 2003 but the team drew at Liverpool {{in spite of a}} polished performance; Emile Heskey headered the ball into the net, scoring for the home team after 90 minutes. On 1 February 2003, Pirès scored a late goal against Fulham, extending Arsenal's lead to six points at the top. This was followed by a 1–1 draw against Newcastle United; manager Sir Bobby Robson after the game criticised referee Neale Barry for his decision to send off midfielder Laurent Robert and Dennis Bergkamp's role in the dismissal, suggesting he [...] "wasn't trying to play the ball to anybody. He kicked the ball against Laurent – I've seen other players <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> I don't like it." [...] Arsenal beat Manchester City 5–1 in their final trip to Maine Road on 22 February 2003.

500|$|The MPAA {{questioned}} elements including Smith's character {{drinking in}} front of a 7-year-old and the character flying under the influence of alcohol. Scenes that were removed to receive a PG-13 rating from the MPAA included a scene of statutory rape, two of three uses of the word [...] "fuck" [...] (the MPAA only permitted one use for the PG-13 rating), and intense shots of needles going into arms. The MPAA allowed scenes of Hancock shoving a prisoner's head up another's behind and of Hancock having explosive ejaculation during sexual intercourse, though Berg chose to save the latter scene for the DVD, explaining, [...] "It just wasn't that funny. Never was. You'd put it {{in front of}} an audience and there'd be two, maybe three people laughing. There was no way to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> then regain even a modicum of emotional integrity." [...] The director kept the scene with the prisoners since a Las Vegas test screening was overwhelmingly successful: [...] "At the end of the day, I couldn't ignore an audience when they're laughing that hard." [...] With such elements, studio executives only became comfortable with Hancock when the marketing approach focused on action and humor. Berg noted, [...] "The ad campaign for this movie is much friendlier than the film." [...] The MPAA ultimately gave the film a PG-13 rating, citing [...] "some intense sequences of sci-fi action and violence and language".|$|E
