50|$|<b>Butter</b> <b>churning</b> is an {{important}} part of Nepalese livlihood. Not only a part of day to day activity, it is a component of traditional culture and identity of Nepalese society.

50|$|Shovelgloving {{is a form}} of {{physical}} exercise based around use of a sledgehammer that has been wrapped in a sweater or otherwise padded. The shovelglove is used to perform shoveling, <b>butter</b> <b>churning</b> and wood chopping motions, amongst others. These natural movements are intended {{to be part of a}} functional training program.|$|R
5000|$|Later <b>butter</b> <b>churns</b> used a {{container}} made from wood, ceramics or galvanized (zinc coated) iron that contained paddles. The hand-turned paddles were {{moved through the}} cream quickly, breaking the cream up by mixing it with air. This allows the butter to be made faster than by simply agitating the cream.|$|R

Bud, however, saw the potential in producing baseball bats, and the elder Hillerich eventually relented to his son.|$|R

50|$|Heckler Plains is a 36-acre farmstead, now park. It {{was once}} home to Major General Winfield Scott Hancock, a General at the Battle of Gettysburg. There still stands a barn from 1761, an 18th-century kitchen garden, and an outdoor bake oven from 1780. Hecklerfest is held {{annually}} and has soap making, <b>butter</b> <b>churning,</b> candle dipping, and other Colonial Era demonstrations.|$|R
5000|$|Evidence {{for the use}} {{of butter}} dates back as early as 2000 BC, and there is mention of it in biblical works. The <b>butter</b> <b>churn</b> itself may have existed as early as the 6th century AD, as can be seen by {{what appears to be a}} churn lid dating from that era.In the European tradition, the <b>butter</b> <b>churn</b> was {{primarily}} a device used by women, and the <b>churning</b> of <b>butter</b> was an essential responsibility along with other household chores. [...] In earlier traditions of butter making, nomadic cultures placed milk in skin bags and produced butter either by shaking the bag manually, or possibly by attaching the bag to a pack animal, and producing butter simply through the movement of the animal. Some theorists believe this is how the butter creation process was discovered. Some cultures still use a process similar to this, whereby a bag is filled with milk, tied to a stick, and vigorously shaken.|$|R
50|$|Originally milk was {{distributed}} in 'pails', a lidded bucket with a handle. These proved impractical for {{transport by road}} or rail, and so the milk churn was introduced, based on the tall conical shape of the <b>butter</b> <b>churn.</b> Later large railway containers, such as the British Railway Milk Tank Wagon were introduced, enabling the transport of larger quantities of milk, and over longer distances.|$|R
50|$|The {{kitchen is}} at the top floor because the hot air rising from cooking stayed away from the lower living spaces in the heat of summer, and also to {{minimize}} damage {{in the event of an}} out-of-control fire. The room features a fireplace with bellows and two turnspits, a wooden bread-kneading machine, a metal <b>butter</b> <b>churn</b> and other tools from that period, or later on.|$|R
50|$|The creamery is {{the source}} of butter from a dairy. Cream is an {{emulsion}} of fat-in-water; the process of churning causes a phase inversion to butter which is an emulsion of water-in-fat. Excess liquid as buttermilk is drained off in the process. Modern creameries are automatically controlled industries, but the traditional creamery needed skilled workers. Traditional tools included the <b>butter</b> <b>churn</b> and Scotch hands.|$|R
50|$|Churning is {{the process}} of shaking up cream (or whole milk) to make butter, and various forms of <b>butter</b> <b>churn</b> have been used for the purpose. In Europe from the Middle Ages until the Industrial Revolution, this was {{generally}} as simple as a barrel with a plunger in it, which was moved by hand. Afterward, mechanical means of churning were usually substituted and are considered to be far better.|$|R
5000|$|The {{woman can}} now send the tilberi to suck milk from others' cows and ewes. It {{will return to}} the window of her dairy and call out [...] "Full belly, Mummy!" [...] or [...] "Churn lid off, Mummy!" [...] and vomit the stolen milk into her <b>butter</b> <b>churn.</b> To suck the milk from the animal's udder, it jumps on her back and lengthens itself to reach down; in some {{versions}} it is said to be able to reach down on both sides to suck from two teats at once. Inflammatory hardening of the udder was traditionally ascribed to the tilberi, and as late as the 19th century, animals were protected by making {{the sign of the cross}} under the udder and over the rump and laying a Psalter on the spine. <b>Butter</b> <b>churned</b> from milk stolen by a tilberi will clump together as if curdled, or even melt away into foam, if the sign of the cross is made over it or the smj√∂rhn√∫tur (butterknot) magical sign drawn in it.|$|R
50|$|Originally, {{buttermilk}} {{referred to}} the liquid left over from <b>churning</b> <b>butter</b> from cultured or fermented cream. Traditionally, before cream could be skimmed from whole milk, the milk was left to sit {{for a period of}} time to allow the cream and milk to separate. During this time, naturally occurring lactic acid-producing bacteria in the milk fermented it. This facilitates the <b>butter</b> <b>churning</b> process, since fat from cream with a lower pH coalesces more readily than that of fresh cream. The acidic environment also helps prevent potentially harmful microorganisms from growing, increasing shelf-life. However, in establishments that used cream separators, the cream was hardly acidic at all.|$|R
50|$|The Hopkins County Museum and Heritage Park {{have also}} held {{numerous}} special events, including a Folk Festival in May and Indian Summer in October. Indian Summer days includes a Dutch oven cooking contest {{as well as}} archaeological digs, candle dipping, Native American dance and storytelling, and exhibitions of blacksmithing, <b>butter</b> <b>churning,</b> and gristmilling. The Museum and Heritage Park also host a 19th century-style Christmas celebration, as well as arts and crafts festivals and bluegrass concerts.|$|R
