5|$|In 1901, Duncan MacDougall, a {{physician}} from Haverhill, Massachusetts, {{who wished to}} scientifically determine if a soul had weight, identified six patients <b>in</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> whose death was imminent. Four were suffering from tuberculosis, one from diabetes, and one from unspecified causes. MacDougall specifically chose people who were suffering from conditions that caused physical exhaustion, as he needed the patients to remain still when they died to measure them accurately. When the patients {{looked like they were}} close to death, their entire bed was placed on an industrial sized scale that was sensitive within two tenths of an ounce (5.6 grams). On the belief that humans have souls and that animals do not, MacDougall later measured the changes in weight from fifteen dogs after death. MacDougall said he wished to use dogs that were sick or dying for his experiment, though was unable to find any. It is therefore presumed he poisoned healthy dogs.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Heart {{failure is}} an {{important}} problem in western countries. <b>In</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> residents heart failure {{is expected to be}} highly prevalent. However, accurate diagnosis of heart failure in these patients is often hampered due to atypical findings and concomitant co-morbidity. In order to deliver adequate nursing care and medical treatment, it is important to get insight into the prevalence of heart failure in this target group of patients. Objectives: To assess the prevalence of heart failure as well as the co-morbidity interfering with heart failure <b>in</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> residents. Methods and results: A systematic literature review was conducted in Medline, Embase, Cinahl and the Cochrane Library. Ten studies were ultimately included. Findings indicate that the mean prevalence of heart failure is 20 % (range 15 - 45 %) {{and that there is a}} significant level of co-morbidity (dementia, diabetes mellitus and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) <b>in</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> residents with heart failure. Conclusion: The reported prevalence of heart failure <b>in</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> residents is higher than in the general population and is associated with considerably co-morbidity. However there are also indications that the prevalence of heart failure <b>in</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> residents is underestimated, negatively affecting quality of life and quality of care.

25|$|Elderspeak can in fact {{contribute}} to decreased comprehension, and can increase confusion. Early social scientists first identified elderspeak and estimated that 20% {{of the communication}} occurring <b>in</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> is actually elderspeak (Caporael, 1981). Caretakers of nursing home residents must be particularly careful when using elderspeak. Although elderspeak {{has been shown to}} help older adults with dementia and Alzheimer’s in language comprehension, they are not immune to feeling disrespected when it is used. Resisting care is an ongoing problem with dementia patients, as well as violent behaviour, and residents of nursing homes are more likely to resist care when their nurse uses elderspeak. Care givers may assume that the elder prefers the nurturing of elderspeak but older adults think of it as demeaning. Older adults in both institutional settings and those receiving home care services report that as many as 40% of their caregivers use speech they perceive as demeaning, and 75% of the interactions that elderly people have are with the staff of the nursing homes.|$|E

25|$|Each year, {{more than}} 2.5 {{million people in}} the United States develop {{pressure}} ulcers. In acute care settings in the United States, the incidence of bedsores is 0.4% to 38%; within long-term care it is 2.2% to 23.9%, and in home care, it is 0% to 17%. Similarly, there is wide variation in prevalence: 10% to 18% in acute care, 2.3% to 28% in long-term care, and 0% to 29% in home care. There is a much higher rate of bedsores in intensive care units because of immunocompromised individuals, with 8% to 40% of those in the ICU developing bedsores. However, pressure ulcer prevalence is highly dependent on the methodology used to collect the data. Using the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (EPUAP) methodology there are similar figures for pressure ulcers in acutely sick people in the hospital. There are differences across countries, but using this methodology pressure ulcer prevalence in Europe was consistently high, from 8.3% (Italy) to 22.9% (Sweden). A recent study in Jordan also showed a figure in this range. Some research shows differences in pressure-ulcer detection among white and black residents <b>in</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>homes.</b>|$|E
