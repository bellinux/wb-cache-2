Furthermore, combined with the analysis of the police time, the balanced degree and effective coverage, the model is optimized. 1. The Node Distribution in the <b>Service</b> <b>Platform</b> Jurisdiction First, in accordance with the principle of division that the area within the liner distance of 3 kilometers from the <b>service</b> <b>platform</b> (known as the effective coverage of line length) is {{under the jurisdiction of the}} <b>service</b> <b>platform,</b> there are a variety of programs to divide the <b>service</b> <b>platform</b> jurisdiction. And the program with the highest coverage rate of the effective lines is selected as the best to divide the <b>service</b> <b>platform</b> jurisdiction. Second, the junction nodes within the distance of three kilometers from <b>service</b> <b>platform,</b> as the objects, will be divided into the effective region. Based on this principle, 92 intersection nodes (including node of the <b>service</b> <b>platform)</b> will be under the jurisdiction of the 20 <b>service</b> <b>platforms.</b> Area in the range assigned dual-objective programming model: 1...|$|R

40|$|<b>Service</b> <b>platforms</b> are {{gradually}} becoming common functional entities {{in the next}} generation networks, i. e., in 4 G-environments. By providing value-added capabilities to networks and end-users, and facilitating service provisioning for 3 rd party service providers, the <b>service</b> <b>platforms</b> will prove indispensable in the near future. However, with this increased importance, the need for cooperation between <b>service</b> <b>platforms</b> also increases. The use of the well-known concept of federation results in a structured framework to this cooperation. The proposed framework carefully defines the notion of <b>service</b> <b>platform</b> domain, applies the concepts of domain federation and service federation to these <b>service</b> <b>platform</b> domains, and prescribes the construction of federations between these domains. The benefits of the resulting <b>service</b> <b>platform</b> federation for all involved parties (end-user, network operator and service provider) are explained by the example of the home environment capability. © 2003 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMany IT <b>service</b> <b>platforms</b> (e. g., cloud {{computing}} platforms) are built as closed systems. They {{do not allow}} their customers to interoperate with other platforms or port their data to other platforms. As switching to a different system is costly, customers of a closed IT system can be considered locked in. Consequently, potential customers, who are aware of this lock-in issue, do not adopt cloud services. Opening up an IT <b>service</b> <b>platform,</b> however, reduces users’ concerns about lock-in and its associated switching cost. It is even predicted that an IT <b>service</b> <b>platform</b> gets more attractive, if it opens up. This paper validates this prediction by analyzing the level of openness (i. e., interoperability, portability, and usability) of {{cloud computing}} platforms on their adoption. For the validation, we develop a value creation model for IT <b>service</b> <b>platforms.</b> Based on this value creation model and a specification of requirements of open cloud computing platforms, {{the relationship between the}} openness of IT <b>service</b> <b>platforms</b> and the adoption of IT <b>service</b> <b>platforms</b> (i. e., attractiveness) is analyzed in detail. In particular, our results show that the level of openness {{plays a major role in}} the adoption of IT <b>service</b> <b>platforms</b> of emerging <b>service</b> providers...|$|R
40|$|Executive summary DESCRIPTION OF THE DELIVERABLE CONTENT AND PURPOSE (MAX 1 PAGE) SPICE (<b>Service</b> <b>Platform</b> for Innovative Communication Environment) is a Framework 6 {{research}} project that aims at {{the design of}} an innovative technological infrastructure for the creation and delivery of ICT services (hereinafter “service platform”). The <b>service</b> <b>platform</b> will support the creation, deployment and delivery of various services in the information society. The <b>service</b> <b>platform</b> will {{also be used to}} deploy and commercialise new communication services or to distribute (enriched) content. The <b>service</b> <b>platform’s</b> added value lies in the distribution of information that has been adapted to a specific user’s needs. This means that the <b>service</b> <b>platform</b> needs to learn about the user’s needs and requirements in the first place, notably by collecting and processing the data that are relevant for the user’s situation. The information and service can then be tailored to meet the user’s needs and requirements and be offered to the user by means of the <b>service</b> <b>platform.</b> Two legal aspects seem to be particularly relevant for the functioning of the servic...|$|R

40|$|The digitization, as the {{profound}} digital transformation of business activities, processes, competencies, and models, leads in many companies {{to the implementation}} of digital <b>service</b> <b>platforms</b> as a nucleus for rapid development and the implementation of reusable digital innovations and solutions.

For this, a longitudinal single-case study method is conducted that comprises three embedded case studies as units of analysis. In this context, the meta-theoretical foundations of S-D logic are reflected and, as a result, resource orchestration as a management capability of <b>service</b> <b>platforms</b> is introduced and discussed.

40|$|The {{significance}} of the <b>service</b> <b>platform</b> is increasing, while studies on this phenomenon remain scarce and insufficient. Most of the researches focus on products, market segmentation and how platform triggers innovation and there's a lack of researches that focus on services, the fast growing industry nowadays. In analyzing the <b>service</b> <b>platform,</b> {{it is important to}} understand the interactions between different players, such as application developers, content providers, network operators, and users. For that purpose, a value network analysis which analyzes the interactions for creating value between the key players is more suitable than the common value chain analysis which is one-directional and sequential. This thesis adopts the value network approach in an attempt to analyze the two different types of <b>service</b> <b>platform,</b> that is, social networking <b>platform</b> and mobile <b>service</b> <b>platform.</b> The Social Networking Service (SNS) is evolving beyond the bounds of a simple personal network and is gradually transforming into a social networking platform where SNS information is used to develop various new services. This thesis examines the positioning and interaction of the key players for the social networking platform and the values that the key players can gain and capture. The mobile <b>service</b> <b>platform</b> is becoming more important, as 3 G mobile technologies are mature and widespread and the smartphone market is growing rapidly. For the mobile <b>service</b> <b>platform,</b> the market players are engaged in a severe competition to control the market through various strategies. The biggest current issue in the mobile market is the movement to open platform strategy to build an ecosystem in which third-party developers can participate. This thesis also examines the positioning and interaction of the key players surrounding the mobile <b>service</b> <b>platform</b> and the values that the key players can gain and capture. Ultimately, this thesis aims to suggest <b>service</b> <b>platform</b> strategies for <b>service</b> <b>platform</b> providers and third party developers from the perspectives of social networking <b>platform</b> and mobile <b>service</b> <b>platform.</b> For that purpose, case studies are conducted in depth. In this thesis, the term "service platform" is defined as a set of interfaces provided for the development of applications or contents as service and software grow into one. by Jang Hoon Yoo.
