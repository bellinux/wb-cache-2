The Lord Jesus calleth {{the end of the}} world his harvest; and saith, moreover, that the angels are his reapers. These angels are {{therefore}} to gather his wheat into his barn, but to gather the ungodly into bundles to burn them. (Matt 13:39,41,49) Unless, therefore, the man that is unsanctified can master the law, and conquer angels; unless he can, as I may say, pull them out of the gateway of heaven, himself is not to come thither for ever. No man goeth to heaven but by the help of the angels--I mean at the day of judgment. For the Son of man [...] "shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other." [...] (Matt 24:31) If those that shall enter in at the strait gate shall enter in thither by the conduct of the holy angels, pray when <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>those</b> men will enter in thither, concerning whom the angels are commanded to gather them, to [...] "bind them in bundles to burn them?" [...] This, therefore, is a third difficulty. The angels will make this entrance strait; yea, too strait for the unjustified and unsanctified to enter in thither.|$|E
6000|$|I observe many of {{our people}} putting a melancholy case on this subject. [...] "It is true" [...] say they, [...] "we are all undone if Wood's halfpence must pass; but what shall we do, if His Majesty puts out a {{proclamation}} commanding us to take them?" [...] This hath been often dinned in my ears. But I desire my countrymen to be assured {{that there is nothing}} in it. The King never issues out a proclamation but to enjoin what the law permits him. He will not issue out a proclamation against law, or if such a thing should happen by a mistake, we are no more obliged to obey it than to run our heads into the fire. Besides, His Majesty will never command us by a proclamation, what he does not offer to command us in the patent itself. There he leaves it to our discretion, so that our destruction must be entirely owing to ourselves. Therefore let no man be afraid of a proclamation, which will never be granted; and if it should, yet upon this occasion, will be of no force. The King's revenues here are near four hundred thousand pounds a year, can you think his ministers will advise him to take them in Wood's brass, which will reduce the value to fifty thousand pounds. England gets a million sterl. by this nation, which, if this project goes on, will be almost reduced to nothing: And <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>those</b> who live in England upon Irish estates will be content to take an eighth or a tenth part, by being paid in Wood's dross? ...|$|E
