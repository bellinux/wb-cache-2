25|$|Through Cambridge and Bloomsbury, Young had {{a longstanding}} {{friendship}} with E.M. Forster. Suffering writer’s block {{while working on}} A Passage to India, the novelist was Young’s guest at the Lacket in early May 1922. Shortly afterwards he wrote to Young declaring, “an unfinished novel’s before me now, and sometimes I work at it with distaste and despair…You certainly have done more than any individual <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>to</b> help me by direct remarks. Your knowledge {{of the business of}} creating seemed to me profounder than that possessed by so-called artists.” These comments suggest that Young gave Forster significant advice and encouragement at a crucial stage on work on the latter’s eventual masterpiece.|$|E
25|$|Can {{there be}} {{anything}} more preposterous than an unknown tongue; {{and in this}} country either for want of books or inability to read, the great part of our congregations must be utterly ignorant of the meaning and sense of the public office of the Church. It may have been prudent, for aught <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>to</b> impose a compliance in this matter with the insulting and reproachful demands of the first reformers; but to continue {{the practice of the}} Latin liturgy in the present state of things must be owing either to chimerical fears of innovation or to indolence and inattention in the first pastors of the national Churches in not joining to solicit or indeed ordain this necessary alteration. It would be nearly 200 years until Carroll's wish for vernacular language-liturgy was realized in the United States {{as a result of the}} Second Vatican Council.|$|E

2500|$|Anderson {{wrote the}} role of Earl Partridge for Jason Robards, but Robards was {{initially}} unable {{to do it because}} of a serious staph infection. Anderson approached George C. Scott, who turned him down. Eventually, Robards was able to do the film. Robards said of his character, [...] "It was sort of prophetic that I be asked to play a guy going out in life. It was just so right for me to do this and bring what <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>to</b> it". According to Hall, much of the material with Partridge was based on Anderson watching his father die of cancer.|$|E

[...] Gritz has claimed that he accepted the party's nomination {{in the belief that}} he would be the running mate of James Traficant.

2500|$|Bart Simpson's Escape from Camp Deadly has {{received}} mixed to negative reviews. Nintendo Power {{gave it a}} 3.4/5 rating in 1991. UGO Networks gave the game a negative review, commenting that [...] "this uninspired train wreck of a Game Boy title fails on nearly every level, {{but most of all}} simply because it's a snore-fest. It's your basic side-scrolling platformer with little to no connection to the source material and lasts only about few hours at best. During the game you come across bullies, camp counselors and even a few wild animals, battling them with spitballs, a boomerang and, in the lunchroom level, food. This one is for completists only." [...] Matt Williamson of the Rocky Mountain News gave the game a C+ grade and commented that [...] "Escape from Camp Deadly tries too hard to be a Nintendo game. It's hard, <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>to</b> try to make game graphics more primitive, but please, guys, the more complex you make the graphics, the more confusing a game gets!" [...] However, the Channel 4 video game programme GamesMaster gave the game an 89% rating.|$|E
2500|$|There {{was more}} parrying between Cotton and the court, but the exchanges were not {{recorded}} in the transcript of the proceedings. [...] Hutchinson next asked the court for leave to [...] "give you the ground of what <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>to</b> be true." [...] She then addressed the court with her own judgment, becoming both didactic and prophetic and claiming her source of knowledge to be direct, personal revelation from God. [...] She ended her statement by prophesying, [...] "if you go on in this course [...] you begin, you will bring a curse upon you and your posterity, and {{the mouth of the}} Lord hath spoken it." [...] "The judges were aghast," [...] historian Emery Battis writes. [...] "She had defied the Court and threatened the commonwealth with God's curse." [...] Cotton attempted to defend her but was challenged by the magistrates, until Winthrop ended the questioning. A vote was taken on a sentence of banishment, only the only dissenters were the two remaining deputies from Boston, Colburn and Coddington. [...] Winthrop then read the order: [...] "Mrs. Hutchinson, the sentence of the court you hear is that you are banished from out of our jurisdiction as being a woman not fit for our society, and are to be imprisoned till the court shall send you away." ...|$|E
