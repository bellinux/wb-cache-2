5|$|The {{sound of}} speech can be {{analyzed}} into a combination of segmental and suprasegmental elements. The segmental elements are those that follow each other in sequences, which are usually represented by distinct letters in alphabetic scripts, such as the Roman script. In <b>free</b> <b>flowing</b> speech, there are no clear boundaries between one segment and the next, nor usually are there any audible pauses between words. Segments therefore are distinguished by their distinct sounds which {{are a result of}} their different articulations, and they can be either vowels or consonants. Suprasegmental phenomena encompass such elements as stress, phonation type, voice timbre, and prosody or intonation, all of which may have effects across multiple segments.|$|E

An empirical example of an induced breakdown at a bottleneck leading to synchronized flow can be seen in Figure 3: synchronized flow emerges through the upstream propagation of a wide moving jam.The existence of empirical induced traffic breakdown (i.e., empirical induced F →S {{phase transition}}) means that a F → S phase transition occurs in a metastable state of <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> at a highway bottleneck. The term metastable <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> means that when small perturbations occur in <b>free</b> <b>flow,</b> the state of <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> is still stable, i.e., <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> persists at the bottleneck.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. May 2014. Major: Chemistry. Advisor: Michael Bowser. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xiii, 109 pages. Micro <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> electrophoresis is a separation technique that continuously separates analyte streams as they travel through an electric field applied perpendicularly to the flow in a microfluidic device. The continuous {{nature of this}} separation technique makes it an ideal choice {{for a number of}} applications including long term continuous monitoring and as a second dimension separation technique in a two dimensional separation scheme. In order for micro <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> electrophoresis devices to reach their full potential in these applications, improvements to the stability of separated analyte streams and zero dead volume connections to these devices must be addressed. This work will detail a simple, yet effective, way for mitigating the effects of electrolysis bubbles on analyte stream stability in micro <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> electrophoresis devices by addition of surfactant or organic modifier to the electrolyte carrier buffer. The longest stable micro <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> electrophoresis separation performed on our devices is shown to support the effectiveness of this approach. An approach for making zero dead volume connections to micro <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> electrophoresis devices will also be detailed. The first two dimensional separation performed with a micro <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> electrophoresis device as the second separation dimension is shown to support the effectiveness of this interface. Finally, the fabrication and operation of a microchip electrophoresis-micro <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> electrophoresis device for seamless integration of two separation dimensions is shown...|$|R

He did not pass 20 in either {{of the last two}} Tests and finished the series with 506 runs at 126.5. He bowled less frequently, with only two wickets in the six Tests. It was on this tour that he first experienced back problems that would hinder his bowling.

This was at a time when squads never had more than 20 players, when players from outside the British Isles were rare in English football, and international players correspondingly more rare. Two of Revie's players would feature in England's 1966 World Cup winning squad, with Jack Charlton playing a pivotal role at the heart of defence, a further four Leeds players would feature in England's 1970 World Cup squad (two more missed out through injury and fatigue), and five Leeds players featured in Scotland's 1974 World Cup squad. In the early 1970s the Leeds team could boast the captain of the Ireland, John Giles, the captain of Scotland, Billy Bremner and the captain of Wales, Terry Yorath. Leeds would also loan their first team coach Les Cocker to the England national team throughout this period; {{as one of the first}} holders of an FA certificate in coaching, he would combine his responsibilities to Leeds with that of the national team and play a pivotal role to the success of England in the 1966 world cup as team trainer.|$|E

Wu’s fundamental diagram is characterised by five parameters, being the <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> speed, wave speed, <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> capacity, queue discharge rate and jam density. The fits appear to be not very sensitive to the right value for the wave speed or the <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> speed. The proposed method therefore entails fixing these two parameters. The method consists of two steps. We first use a triangular fundamental diagram to separate the congested branch from the <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> branch. Then, the remaining three parameters of Wu’s fundamental diagram are fitted on each of the branches using a least square fit. This method is shown to be robust for cases tested in real life, and hence very noisy, data. Transport and PlanningCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
