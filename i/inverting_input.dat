25|$|Without {{negative}} feedback, {{and perhaps}} with positive feedback for regeneration, an op-amp {{acts as a}} comparator. If the <b>inverting</b> <b>input</b> is held at ground (0V) directly or by a resistor Rg, and the input voltage Vin applied to the non-inverting input is positive, the output will be maximum positive; if Vin is negative, the output will be maximum negative.

With [...] removed (open circuited), they are simple unity gain buffers; the circuit will work in that state, with gain simply equal to [...] and high input impedance because of the buffers. The buffer gain could be increased by putting resistors between the buffer <b>inverting</b> <b>inputs</b> and ground to shunt {{away some of the}} negative feedback; however, the single resistor [...] between the two <b>inverting</b> <b>inputs</b> is a much more elegant method: it increases the differential-mode gain of the buffer pair while leaving the common-mode gain equal to 1. This increases the common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) of the circuit and also enables the buffers to handle much larger common-mode signals without clipping than would be the case if they were separate and had the same gain.Another benefit of the method is that it boosts the gain using a single resistor rather than a pair, thus avoiding a resistor-matching problem, and very conveniently allowing the gain of the circuit to be changed by changing the value of a single resistor. A set of switch-selectable resistors or even a potentiometer can be used for , providing easy changes to the gain of the circuit, without the complexity of having to switch matched pairs of resistors.|$|R

2500|$|A null {{detector}} {{is one that}} functions to identify when a given value is zero. Comparators can be a type of amplifier distinctively for null comparison measurements. It is the equivalent to a very high gain amplifier with well-balanced inputs and controlled output limits. The circuit compares the two input voltages, determining the larger. The inputs are an unknown voltage and a reference voltage, usually referred to as vu and vr. A reference voltage is generally on the non-inverting input (+), while vu is usually on the <b>inverting</b> <b>input</b> (...) [...] (A circuit diagram would display the inputs according to their sign {{with respect to the}} output when a particular input is greater than the other.) [...] The output is either positive or negative, for example ±12V. In this case, the idea is to detect when there is no difference between in the input voltages. This gives the identity of the unknown voltage since the reference voltage is known.|$|E
2500|$|If {{predictable}} {{operation is}} desired, negative feedback is used, by applying {{a portion of}} the output voltage to the <b>inverting</b> <b>input.</b> The closed-loop feedback greatly reduces the gain of the circuit. [...] When negative feedback is used, the circuit's overall gain and response becomes determined mostly by the feedback network, rather than by the op-amp characteristics. If the feedback network is made of components with values small relative to the op amp's input impedance, the value of the op-amp's open-loop response AOL does not seriously affect the circuit's performance. The response of the op-amp circuit with its input, output, and feedback circuits to an input is characterized mathematically by a transfer function; designing an op-amp circuit to have a desired transfer function is in the realm of electrical engineering. [...] The transfer functions are important in most applications of op-amps, such as in analog computers. High input impedance at the input terminals and low output impedance at the output terminal(s) are particularly useful features of an op-amp.|$|E
2500|$|This {{portion of}} the op amp cleverly changes a {{differential}} signal at the op amp inputs to a single-ended signal {{at the base of}} Q15, and in a way that avoids wastefully discarding the signal in either leg. To see how, notice that a small negative change in voltage at the <b>inverting</b> <b>input</b> (Q2 base) drives it out of conduction, and this incremental decrease in current passes directly from Q4 collector to its emitter, resulting in a decrease in base drive for Q15. On the other hand, a small positive change in voltage at the non-inverting input (Q1 base) drives this transistor into conduction, reflected in an increase in current at the collector of Q3. This current drives Q7 further into conduction, which turns on current mirror Q5/Q6. Thus, the increase in Q3 emitter current is mirrored in an increase in Q6 collector current; the increased collector currents shunts more from the collector node and results in a decrease in base drive current for Q15. Besides avoiding wasting 3dB of gain here, this technique decreases common-mode gain and feedthrough of power supply noise.|$|E

Grammars designed under such theories are, therefore, suitable for both parsing and generation. However, practical implementations of such theories don't usually support bidirectional processing of grammars. We present a grammar development system that includes a compiler of grammars (for parsing and generation) to abstract machine instructions, and an interpreter for the abstract machine language. The generation compiler <b>inverts</b> <b>input</b> grammars (designed for parsing) to a form more suitable for generation.

30|$|A {{negation}} of the transferred logic value occurs by {{moving from one}} layer to the other. When designing a wire crossing, this has no real effect as eventually the transferred logic value will be negated once more upon moving {{back to the original}} layer. In the case when processing is to be performed on different layers, however, this fact has to be kept in mind. For states C and D, it presents no real problem, as they both represent the same logic value, and alternating between the two states is achieved through simple addition of another adjacent cell. For states A and B, which represent two opposite logic values (− 1 and 1, respectively), this, however, means adding an inverter (which in its simplest form could be just one cell displaced diagonally) or designing the processing element based on an <b>inverted</b> <b>input</b> value.|$|R
