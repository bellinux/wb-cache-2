40|$|Abstract — Integration {{of advice}} is {{intended}} to acquire knowledge from an agent with more comprehensive information. This paper describes Arian, a general architecture for advice integration. Advice is injected into the system using the advice model which {{is a case in}} a CBR system. The architecture comprises an advice adapter to model <b>incomming</b> advice as cases of a CBR system. The Arian architecture is a 2 -layered structure in which a refiner component in the top layer is used to modify agent behaviors. The paper also discusses how trust is modelled to distinguish between multiple sources of advice including humans. Arian, the champion team of RoboCup’ 02 Rescue Simulation Competitions, as an example of an implemented agent based on this proposed architecture is introduced to show that the architecture is well suited for advice integration. Test results are provided to show how Arian advice-taking agents change behavior based on <b>incomming</b> advice.

In this paper we study the case, when the response for every a i {{is a single}} bit, which is interpreted as pick/not-topick. The player's objective is to pick as many elements as possible under the condition, that the set of picked elements, A(s), satisfies a certain prescribed property.

In their model G is known to the player, {{but she does not}} know when the input sequence ends. In this paper we allow A(s) to belong to an arbitrary, but fixed monotone set system M, where M is known to the player.

Data from 337 respondents were collected via online questionnaire. Structural equation models were used to assess the factor structure of the <b>INCOM</b> and test for relationships with RST traits. The results confirmed previous findings that the <b>INCOM</b> contains two factors: Ability, which relates to the comparison of performance, and Opinion, which relates to the comparison of thoughts and emotions. The two-factor model was found to be superior to the commonly used 1 -factor solution. The models further revealed significant relationships with RST factors: positive associations between the Ability factor and the Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS) and Behavioural Approach System (BAS) Reward Reactivity; positive associations between the Opinion factor and BAS Reward Reactivity and Goal-Drive Persistence, and a negative association with BAS Impulsivity. These findings indicate that using the <b>INCOM</b> as a single scale is likely to miss significant unique relationships.

40|$|In this project, a {{new model}} for belief {{revision}} based on abduction will be elaborated {{within the framework of}} AGM belief revision. We construe “abduction ” as the process of reasoning in which explanatory (causal) hypothesis are formed and evaluated. Our basic hypothesis is that agent seeks explanation, before she accepts and integate the new evidential information with the old. As a result, it generates heirarchies of explanation and out of which causal explanations are considered to be most plaussible explanations. Here, not all explanations are acceptable for abduction, but only the best or atleast good ones [41]. The dynamics of belief based on plaussibility of explanations would give us a reasonable mechanism whether or not to give priority to the <b>incomming</b> information. In this proposed research, we will (1) extend AGM framework with abductive revision operators (2) we characterize such revision with an ordering called causal epistemic entrenchment ordering.

Unfortunately, a lot has happened, so there is much that I will have to leave out. I hope that some of you will make up for this with your final projects. 17. 2 Achieving Capacity on the BEC You will recall that the capacity of the binary erasure channel (BEC) with erasure probability p is 1 − p. It was proved [LMSS 01] that LDPC codes can achieve the capacity of these channels. In particular, for any �> 0, there exists an infinite family of LDPC codes that have arbitrarily low error probability on the BEC with erasure probability 1 − p − �. To explain how these codes are constructed, I will recall some material from Lecture 13. In that lecture, we observed for the (3, 6) -regular constructions, • If the probability that each <b>incomming</b> message to a parity node is? is a, then the probability that an outgoing message is? is (1 − (1 − a) 5). • If the initial erasure probability was p 0 and the probability that each <b>incomming</b> message to an “= ” (bit) node is? is b, then the probability that a message leaving such a node is? is p 0 b 2. To produce better codes, we will use carefully specified irregular constructions. In particular, we will speciry the fraction of nodes of each type of each degree. While it might seem strange, we will do this from the perspective of edges. For example, the fractions for the bit nodes will be specified by a sequence � 1, � 2, � 3, [...] ., �dl, where dl is the maximum degree of a bit node. The number �i specified the fraction of edges that are connected to bit nodes of degree i. We will also specify a sequence � 1, [...] ., �dr, where �i is the fraction of edges that are connected to parity nodes of degree i. The parameters must satisfy � �i = 1 and � �i = 1...|$|E
40|$|Purinergic P 2 X receptors are non-selective {{cationic}} channels gated by extracellular ATP. Up to now, seven mammalian subunits, termed P 2 X 1 -X 7, {{have been}} cloned and characterized. These receptors comprise a new membrane channel family with distinct structural and functional features. P 2 X receptors {{take part in}} a signalling network called "purinergic signalling" which is widely exploited in both somatic and neuronal tissues. In the central nervous system, they are highly expressed in the hypothalamus and hypophysis, where they participate in the regulation of homeostatic and reproductional functions. The main focus of my Thesis is on the expression and functional role of P 2 X receptors in supraoptic nuclei of the rat hypothalamus. These nuclei contain two populations of magnocellular neurons which produce either oxytocin or arginine-vasopressin. Delivery of the hormones into the systemic blood relies on the electrical activity of supraoptic neurons, which is in turn governed by the <b>incomming</b> synaptic inputs. It has been recently shown, that the process of hormone release from supraoptic neurons is regulated by extracellular ATP.
