5|$|During 1803–06 the Third Coalition {{fought the}} First French Empire and its client states (see table at right). Although several naval battles {{determined}} {{control of the}} seas, {{the outcome of the}} war was decided on the continent, predominantly in two major land operations in the <b>Danube</b> valley: the Ulm campaign in the upper <b>Danube</b> and the Vienna campaign, in the middle <b>Danube</b> valley.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Danube</b> {{crested newt}} or <b>Danube</b> newt (Triturus dobrogicus) is {{a species of}} newt found {{in central and eastern}} Europe, along the basin of the <b>Danube</b> river and some of its tributaries and in the Dnieper delta. It has a smaller and more slender body than the other crested newts in genus Triturus but like these, males develop a {{conspicuous}} jagged seam on back and tail during breeding season.|$|E
5|$|The {{city has}} a total area of , making it the second-largest city in Slovakia by area (after the {{township}} of Vysoké Tatry). Bratislava straddles the <b>Danube</b> River, which it had developed around and for centuries was the chief transportation route to other areas. The river passes through the city from the west to the southeast. The Middle <b>Danube</b> basin begins at Devín Gate in western Bratislava. Other rivers are the Morava River, which forms the northwestern border {{of the city and}} enters the <b>Danube</b> at Devín, the Little <b>Danube,</b> and the Vydrica, which enters the <b>Danube</b> in the borough of Karlova Ves.|$|E

50|$|Dunavski Venac {{is entirely}} {{residential}} area. It has no industrial facilities while commerce has begun developing only {{recently as the}} neighborhood stretched along the Zrenjaninski put. The name of the neighborhood is descriptive, patterned after the name of Belgrade's municipality of Savski Venac and means the <b>Danube's</b> rim (even {{though it is not}} on the <b>Danube's</b> bank).|$|R

5|$|According to Béla Miklós Szőke's theory, the {{detailed}} description of the Magyars by western contemporary sources and the immediate Hungarian intervention in local wars give the presumption that the Hungarians had already lived on the eastern territories of the Carpathian Basin since the middle of the 9th century. Regarding the right location of early Hungarian settlements, the Arabic geographer al-Jayhani (only snippets of his work survived in other Muslim authors' papers) in the 870s placed the Hungarians between Don and <b>Danube</b> rivers. Szőke identifies al-Jayhani's <b>Danube</b> with the middle <b>Danube</b> region, as opposed to the previously assumed lower <b>Danube</b> region, because following al-Jayhani's description the Christian Moravians were the western neighbors of the Magyars.|$|E
5|$|After 1242 {{most of the}} {{territory}} between the <b>Danube</b> and the Black Sea {{was included in the}} area dominated by the Mongols. Although the Byzantine Empire reestablished control over the <b>Danube</b> Delta in the 1260s, it fell again under the direct rule of the Golden Horde sometime before 1337. By the end of the 13thcentury, flourishing communities of Genoese merchants had settled in the towns of Vicina, Chilia and Licostomo.|$|E
5|$|An {{alliance}} between the Iazyges and the Dacians led the Romans {{to focus more on}} the <b>Danube</b> than the Rhine. This is reflected by the placement of the Roman legions; During the time of Augustus's rule, there were eight legions stationed along the Rhine, four stationed in Mainz and another four in Cologne. Within a hundred years of Augustus' rule, however, Roman military resources had become centred along the <b>Danube</b> instead of the Rhine, with nine legions stationed along the <b>Danube</b> and only one at the Rhine. However, by the time of Marcus Aurelius, twelve legions were stationed along the <b>Danube.</b> The Romans also built a series of forts along the entire right bank of the Danubefrom Germany {{all the way to the}} Black Seaand in the provinces of Rhaetia, Noricum, and Pannonia the legions constructed bridge-head forts. Later, this system was expanded to the lower <b>Danube,</b> with the key castra of Poetovio, Brigetio, and Carnuntum. The Classis Pannonica and Classis Flavia Moesica were deployed to the right and lower <b>Danube,</b> respectively; however, they had to overcome the mass of whirlpools and cataracts of the Iron Gates.|$|E

5|$|Diocletian {{spent the}} spring of 293 {{traveling}} with Galerius from Sirmium (Sremska Mitrovica, Serbia) to Byzantium (Istanbul, Turkey). Diocletian then returned to Sirmium, where he would remain for the following winter and spring. He campaigned against the Sarmatians again in 294, probably in the autumn, and won a victory against them. The Sarmatians' defeat kept them from the <b>Danube</b> provinces for a long time. Meanwhile, Diocletian built forts north of the <b>Danube,</b> at Aquincum (Budapest, Hungary), Bononia (Vidin, Bulgaria), Ulcisia Vetera, Castra Florentium, Intercisa (Dunaújváros, Hungary), and Onagrinum (Begeč, Serbia). The new forts became {{part of a new}} defensive line called the Ripa Sarmatica. In 295 and 296 Diocletian campaigned in the region again, and won a victory over the Carpi in the summer of 296. Later during both 299 and 302, as Diocletian was then residing in the East, it was Galerius' turn to campaign victoriously on the <b>Danube.</b> By the end of his reign, Diocletian had secured {{the entire length of the}} <b>Danube,</b> provided it with forts, bridgeheads, highways, and walled towns, and sent fifteen or more legions to patrol the region; an inscription at Sexaginta Prista on the Lower <b>Danube</b> extolled restored tranquilitas to the region. The defense came at a heavy cost, but was a significant achievement in an area difficult to defend.|$|E

50|$|The term “sinking” is more {{accurate}} than “seeping”, because, instead of just distributing into the soil, the <b>Danube’s</b> water flows through underground caverns to the Aachtopf, where it emerges as the river Radolfzeller Aach.|$|R
5|$|Early Neolithic era began around 5500 BCE {{with the}} arrival from the middle <b>Danube</b> area of people, who kept livestock, {{cultivated}} crops, made pottery and smooth-surface tools. Their land tilling predecessors had been coming into the Balkans and then the <b>Danube</b> region from Anatolia beginning a thousand years earlier. They formed the first settled rural communities, thus forging the most fundamental civilizational advance.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the capture}} of Belgrade on 11 October and the initial {{clearance}} of mines and other obstacles, the flotilla sailed downstream to Orșova near the Hungarian–Romanian border {{and waited for the}} lower <b>Danube</b> to be swept for mines.

5|$|In 1800 or 1799 (sources vary), Karol Kniaziewicz {{organized}} the 6,000-strong Third Legion (the <b>Danube</b> Legion, or the Legion du Rhine) {{to fight against}} the Austrians in Bavaria. The <b>Danube</b> Legion, bolstered by Karwowski's cavalry unit, fought as part of the Army of the Rhine at Berg, Bernheim and Offenburg, garrisoning the fortress of Philippsbourg after the armistice of Parsdorf (15 July). Polish forces also fought in the Battle of Hohenlinden on 3 December 1800. According to Davies, the <b>Danube</b> Legion would suffer significant casualties in the short period after the battle {{and the end of the}} campaign on 25 December that year.|$|E
5|$|In 680 Bulgar tribes {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Asparukh moved south across the <b>Danube</b> and settled in the area between the lower <b>Danube</b> and the Balkan, establishing their capital at Pliska.

The Bulgars gradually mixed with the local population, adopting a common language on the basis of the local Slavic dialect.|$|E
5|$|In April 1918, Bosna, {{along with}} three other monitors, two patrol boats and a tug were formed into Flottenabteilung Wulff (Fleet Division Wulff) {{under the command of}} Flottenkapitän (Fleet Captain) Olav Wulff. Flottenabteilung Wulff was sent through the mouth of the <b>Danube</b> and across the Black Sea to Odessa, where it spent several months {{supporting}} the Austro-Hungarian troops enforcing the peace agreement with Russia. It returned to the <b>Danube</b> at the end of August, and was anchored at Brăila on 12 September. On 16 October, Bosna {{and the rest of the}} 1st Monitor Division sailed from Brăila to Belene. The <b>Danube</b> Flotilla then protected Austro-Hungarian troops withdrawing towards Budapest, fighting French and irregular Serbian forces as they withdrew, and arrived on 6 November.|$|E

5|$|In addition, Constantine {{appears to}} have reorganised the border forces along the <b>Danube,</b> {{replacing}} the old-style alae and cohortes with new units of cunei (cavalry) and auxilia (infantry) respectively. It is unclear how the new-style units differed from the old-style ones, but those stationed on the border (as opposed {{to those in the}} comitatus) may have been smaller, perhaps half the size. In sectors other than the <b>Danube,</b> old-style auxiliary regiments survived.|$|E
