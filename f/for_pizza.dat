500|$|The International Dictionary of Food and Cooking defines {{pizza cheese}} as [...] "a soft spun-curd cheese similar to Mozzarella made from cow's milk..." [...] that is [...] "...used {{particularly}} for pizzas and contains somewhat less water than real Mozzarella..." [...] Most {{are at least}} 95 percent Mozzarella, with different moisture and fat densities. Cheese for frozen pizzas may be comminuted, in which the cheese is processed into minute granules or fragments. Low-moisture Mozzarella can be formulated specifically <b>for</b> <b>pizza.</b> Cheese may be processed into blocks, from which the product can be grated, made into granules or sliced for use on pizza or other foods. Pizza cheese frequently consists of a blend {{of two or more}} cheeses, such as low-moisture Mozzarella or Provolone. Low-moisture Mozzarella was first manufactured in dairy factories in the Midwestern United States, and was originally called [...] "pizza cheese".

500|$|After 15 {{months of}} training, he began auditioning in Los Angeles.

Later, the show became a cult hit among audiences. He has since described the series as [...] "one of the most fun" [...] work experiences that he has had. In another interview, Franco said: [...] "When we were doing Freaks and Geeks, I didn’t quite understand how movies and TV worked, and I would improvise even if the camera wasn’t on me... So I was improvising a little bit back then, {{but not in a}} productive way."

500|$|Coulter and Grewal {{investigated}} if the birthday-number effect {{could be}} exploited {{in sales and}} marketing. Over 200 participants of an online survey were asked about an advertisement for a pasta dinner, where the price was secretly matched to {{the day of the}} month of their birthday. For example, someone born on the 16th [...] of a certain month would see the price $39.16. The researchers found that matching numbers increased price liking and purchase intention. When introducing a perceived threat to the self into the task, they found an exaggerated effect. From this they concluded that the positive affect linked to birthday-numbers transfers directly to consumers’ price predilections, and ultimately affects their purchase intentions. Keller and Gierl sought to replicate Coulter and Grewal's study. They manipulated the prices in advertisements <b>for</b> <b>pizza</b> and a music streaming service to match the birthday (day, year) of the participants in their lab study. They did not find any disproportionate liking of matching prices, neither for the year the participant was born in or the day. Keller and Gierl concluded that there must be some prerequisites such as priming stimuli to trigger the effect, although they suggested it is possible that their participants, who all happened to have been born between 1990 and 1999, saw their birthyear as price so often in real life that it had become too common.|$|E
