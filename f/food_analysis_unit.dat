40|$|Food {{has been}} subject to various {{characterization}} methods for centuries. Optical characterization methods like spectroscopy were implemented long ago. Different requirements arise from integrity (contaminations, foreign objects, spoilage) and quality (composition) issues. In our modern world, automated optical tools are being used for several tasks, in particular for testing raw materials and for in-line monitoring of food processing. In the future new options for optical <b>food</b> <b>analysis</b> and inspection will arise. On site testing from “field to fork” drives the development of mobile <b>analysis</b> <b>units</b> for harvesting, transportation, storage and distribution, which will enable a more detailed control during processing. In addition, the consumer is interested in an on-site analysis using household or mobile devices.

40|$|Electronic noses {{have been}} {{designed}} and utilized {{for a variety of}} different applications. Undoubtedly, among these, <b>food</b> <b>analysis</b> has gained the major attention. In fact in <b>food</b> <b>analysis</b> there is a double opportunity for electronic noses developers. The first is that the chemical patterns considered are sometimes rather complex, so the introduction of an instrument able to consider at the same time, in an easy experimental procedure, all the chemical pattern is certainly appealing. The second aspect of <b>food</b> <b>analysis</b> concerns the wide utilization of the natural olfaction and taste. Panels of well trained tasters and smellers are daily utilized to certify the goodness of foods anti their fitting with the human taste. Therefore <b>food</b> <b>analysis</b> represents also a practical field where performances of natural and artificial olfaction and taste can be compared and where an electronic nose can be utilized as an essential support of the human capabilities. In this paper some key issues concerning the applications of electronic noses to <b>food</b> <b>analysis</b> will be examined and examples of applications, related to the electronic nose developed at the University of Rome Tor Vergata will be illustrated and discussed...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a service platform for distributed multimedia content analysis. The platform enables versatile analysis of different content types, including video, image, audio and textual content. The platform is implemented using web service technologies applying a modular design where different analysis tasks {{are provided by}} individual services, called <b>analysis</b> <b>units.</b> Detailed descriptions of the <b>analysis</b> <b>units</b> are stored in a service registry. A simple {{and easy to use}} web service interface is provided to the platform via which client applications can utilize all the provided analysis functionalities even in a single request. The platform is easily extensible as new <b>analysis</b> <b>units</b> can be added simply by registering them to the service registry. After a new unit has been registered, it is immediately available for use. An <b>analysis</b> <b>unit</b> can also form a service composition by utilizing other existing units in order to provide higher level semantic analysis results. A uniform metadata model for presenting the analysis results enables interoperability between different <b>analysis</b> <b>units.</b> The scalability of the platform is enabled via a resource-aware load balancing method. The load between replicated <b>analysis</b> <b>units</b> is balanced according to their computational capacity and current load level. The efficiency of the developed load balancing method is measured by replicating a single <b>analysis</b> <b>unit</b> into a heterogeneous hardware environment. The platform's ability to compose the results from different <b>analysis</b> <b>units</b> as a response to a single request is demonstrated in a composition test, where a client application sends requests for different analysis result combinations...|$|R
