25|$|The launch {{countdown}} began 10 June 2009, but on 13 June 2009, as tanking was underway, a {{gaseous hydrogen}} leak on a vent line near the Ground Umbilical Carrier Plate was observed, and the 13 June 2009 launch was scrubbed at 00:26 EDT. As liquid hydrogen fuel is pumped in, {{some of it}} boils off as the extremely cold liquid enters the warm external tank. The vent line valve controls the resulting buildup of gas pressure by allowing excess gas to escape into a ground-side vent line, {{which leads to a}} <b>flare</b> <b>stack</b> at a safe distance away from the pad. A similar leak situation was seen during the first launch attempt of STS-119. NASA managers met on 14 June 2009 and 15 June 2009 and evaluated the leak, discussed steps that had to be taken, and set a new launch date of 17 June 2009, at 05:40 EDT.|$|E
2500|$|On 5 November 2010, Discoverys launch attempt, a {{hydrogen}} leak was detected at the Ground Umbilical Carrier Plate (GUCP) during the fueling process. The plate was an attachment point between the external tank and a 17-inch pipe that carried gaseous hydrogen safely {{away from the}} tank to the <b>flare</b> <b>stack,</b> where it was burned off. All had been proceeding to plan with the tank [...] "fast filled" [...] during tanking, until the first leak indication was revealed. Firstly, a 33,000 ppm leak then reduced to a level below 20,000 ppm was recorded. The Launch Commit Criteria limit was 40–44,000 ppm. The leak was only being observed during the cycling of the vent valve to [...] "open" [...] to release the gaseous hydrogen from the tank to the <b>flare</b> <b>stack.</b> Controllers decided to stop valve cycling {{in order to increase}} the pressure and attempt to force a seal before attempting to complete the fast fill process. At this stage, the leak spiked and remained at the highest 60,000 ppm level (likely even at a higher value), indicating a serious problem with the GUCP's seal.|$|E

The method started by roasting bones, then employed the use of clay retorts encased in a very hot brick furnace to distill out the highly toxic elemental phosphorus product. Alternately, precipitated phosphates could be made from ground-up bones that had been de-greased and treated with strong acids. White phosphorus could then be made by heating the precipitated phosphates, mixed with ground coal or charcoal in an iron pot, and distilling off phosphorus vapour in a retort.

40|$|Increasing {{regulatory}} {{standards for}} the limitation of greenhouse gas and other pollutant emissions from industrial facilities require new environmental control strategies and innovative and cost- effective measurement techniques. Elevated <b>flare</b> <b>stacks</b> present a difficult measurement challenge, because {{it is extremely difficult}} to determine concentration in the post-combustion gas of operational flares by sampling techniques. A remote sensing measurement system has to be used, therefore. Fourier-Transform-Infrared-Spectroscopy (FTIS) measurements were realized using a mobile environmental laboratory which is equipped with a high resolution K 300 spectrometer. A Multi-component Air Pollution Software (MAPS) was used to determine CO 2, CH 4, CO and NO concentrations. It is based on radiative transfer line-by-line calculations and least-square fit procedures. The paper focuses on the results of FTIS flare emissions measurements at natural gas production facilities. Different types offlares have been investigated under varying operational conditions. Emission rates and combustion efficiencies are calculated which indicate that the environmental impact of methane emissions from flares is rather small...|$|R

40|$|Gas flaringis {{the burning}} of natural gas and {{petroleum}} hydrocarbons in <b>flare</b> <b>stacks</b> by upstream oil companies in oil fields during operations. Gas flaring is the singular and most common source of global warming and contributes to emissions of carbon monoxide, nitrogen (II) oxide and methane which have the propensity of causing environmental pollution and ecological disturbances or destruction. This research explore and presents a method of analysing {{the environmental impact of}} gas flaring in the Niger Delta so to provide the data required for the complete analysis and evaluation of the various observed and noted health and environmental effects of gas flaring in Niger Delta. The major environmental impacts considered in the study are environmental pollution, and ecological disturbance or destruction. Several visitations to the neighbouring communities adjacent to most gas flare locations were carried out to ascertain any existence of common environmental hazards.

40|$|Continuous {{monitoring}} of methane emissions has assumed greater {{significance in the}} recent past due to increasing focus on global warming issues. Many industries have also identified the need for ppm level methane measurement as a means of gaining carbon credits. Conventional instruments based on NDIR spectroscopy are unable to offer the high selectivity and sensitivity required for such measurements. Here we discuss the development of a robust VCSEL based system for accurate low level measurements of methane. A possible area of application is the measurement of residual methane whilst monitoring the output of <b>flare</b> <b>stacks</b> and exhaust gases from methane combustion engines. The system employs a Wavelength Modulation Spectroscopy (WMS) scheme with second harmonic detection at 1651 nm. Optimum modulation frequency and ramp rates were chosen to maintain high resolution and fast response times which are vital for the intended application. Advanced data processing techniques were used to achieve long term sensitivity of the order of 10 - 5 in absorbance. The system is immune to cross interference from other gases and its inherent design features makes it ideal for large scale commercial production. The instrument maintains its calibration and offers a completely automated continuous monitoring solution for remote on site deployment...|$|R

40|$|In this study, a fiber Bragg grating sensor is {{proposed}} {{to detect the}} temperature {{on the surface of}} mechanical structure. In particular, we point out that the method is well suited for measuring very small temperature because they are able to withstand in a high temperature environments, where standard thermocouple methods are failed. The sensing principle is based on tracking of Bragg wavelength shifts caused by the temperature change. In this work, fiber grating was placed inside the microwave oven. The temperature was increased with equal increments. The shift in the Bragg wavelength shift of this sensor due to temperature change was obtained from optical spectrum analyzer. The wavelength shift of this sensor due to temperature change is 10. 5 pm/C equal to that of general FBG. Furthermore, the correlation of theoretical calculation and experimental results show the capability and feasibility of the purpose technique. Consequently the practical used of this sensor has been confirmed. This method can also be useful monitoring the flow allocation on production wells, fire detection, steel building, tunnels, leak detection and temperature monitoring of reactor vessels, <b>flare</b> <b>stacks,</b> power line. Therefore, it is expected that the fiber Bragg grating sensor, because of its uniqueness in many aspects and being at an affordable cost, has an excellent prospect in temperature measurements...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe North Ecuadorian Amazon (NEA) {{is one of}} {{the most}} biodiverse places per surface area on Earth. However, its {{richness}} and importance is threatened by complex human activities driven by extensive agriculture development and oil exploration and extraction, directly responsible for forest clearing. Furthermore this extractive industry has long been regarded as polluting the environment and causing cancer and other diseases to the local population. Two periods of extractive practices and technology implementation can be well differentiated (before environmental regulation 1965 - 2000 vs. after regulations 2001 -to present). GIS data and production inventories of potential polluting infrastructures due to spilling and infiltration (i. e. drill cuttings pits, oil wells, <b>flare</b> <b>stacks,</b> torches and pipes) for more than 45 years, have been collected. These data are not geographically homogeneous and cover only 10 - 20 % of the total number of infrastructures that represent a risk for the environment. Our aim is to estimate the spatial influence of toxic emissions from these sources. The spatial statistical analysis of these data will allow us to identify patterns for a spatially-explicit model of risk. First results show that contamination differs geographically, while oil infrastructure density and population overlap. Oil practices in absence of environmental regulations can led to higher contamination than permitted by actual Ecuadorian regulations’ standards. A linear regression between cumulative oil contamination and the density of oil infrastructures is observed, notably concerning the number of wells (r²= 0. 83) and the length of pipes. These findings could help defining key parameters to facilitate future decision-making processes for environment and population protection in highly biodiverse biomes...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{two different}} experimental approaches which concentrate on capturing the exit flow {{distribution of the}} anode side of a prototype fuel cell stack operated with air at realistic flow rates. The first approach intends to visualize the penetration depth of the millimetre-sized exit jets in a laminar mixing flow by introducing oil-based tracer particles to the exit header and leaving the bipolar plates and exit jets unseeded. The second approach concentrates on measuring the exit jet velocity field downstream of the channel exits by particle image velocimetry (PIV) and by applying a water-based micron-sized droplet seeding to the bipolar plate channels. The traversal of the imaged plane along the bipolar plate exits finally allowed {{the reconstruction of the}} complete three-dimensional, time-averaged flow field in high resolution (restricted to two components of velocity). An overview of the experimental setup, including the implementation of a miniaturized light sheet probe, and the data evaluation are given. In addition, the application of a robust PIV evaluation algorithm based on multi-grid, multi-pass correlation averaging methods is described which had to be applied at higher flow rates due to highly dynamic fluctuations of the flow, lower particle image density and regionally significant background signal due to laser <b>flare</b> on the <b>stack</b> plates...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} herein {{a system}} of self-magnetically insulated vacuum transmission lines (MITLs) that operated successfully at 20  MA, 3  MV, and 55  TW. The system delivered the electromagnetic-power pulse generated by the Z accelerator to a physics-package load on over 1700 Z shots. The system included four levels that were electrically in parallel. Each level consisted of a water <b>flare,</b> vacuum-insulator <b>stack,</b> vacuum <b>flare,</b> and 1. 3 -m-radius conical outer MITL. The outputs of the four outer MITLs were connected in parallel by a 7. 6 -cm-radius 12 -post double-post-hole vacuum convolute. The convolute added the currents of the four outer MITLs, and delivered the combined current to a single 6 -cm-long inner MITL. The inner MITL delivered the current to the load. The total initial inductance of the stack-MITL system was 11  nH. A 300 -element transmission-line-circuit model of the system has been developed using the tl code. The model accounts for the following: (i)  impedance and electrical length {{of each of the}} 300 circuit elements, (ii)  electron emission from MITL-cathode surfaces wherever the electric field has previously exceeded a constant threshold value, (iii)  Child-Langmuir electron loss in the MITLs before magnetic insulation is established, (iv)  MITL-flow-electron loss after insulation, assuming either collisionless or collisional electron flow, (v)  MITL-gap closure, (vi)  energy loss to MITL conductors operated at high lineal current densities, (vii)  time-dependent self-consistent inductance of an imploding z-pinch load, and (viii)  load resistance, which is assumed to be constant. Simulations performed with the tl model demonstrate that the nominal geometric outer-MITL-system impedance that optimizes overall performance is a factor of ∼ 3 greater than the convolute-load impedance, which is consistent with an analytic model of an idealized MITL-load system. Power-flow measurements demonstrate that, until peak current, the Z stack-MITL system performed as expected. tl calculations of the peak electromagnetic power at the stack, stack energy, stack voltage, outer-MITL current, and load current, as well as the pinch-implosion time, agree with measurements to within 5 %. After peak current, tl calculations and measurements diverge, which appears to be {{due in part to the}} idealized pinch model assumed by tl. The results presented suggest that the design of the Z accelerator’s stack-MITL system, and the tl model, can serve as starting points for the design of stack-MITL systems of future superpower accelerators...|$|R
40|$|Blazars exhibit flares {{across the}} entire {{electromagnetic}} spectrum. Many γ-ray flares are highly correlated with flares detected at longer wavelengths; however, a small subset appears to occur in isolation, {{with little or no}} correlated variability at longer wavelengths. These "orphan" γ-ray flares challenge current models of blazar variability, most of which are unable to reproduce this type of behavior. Macdonald et al. have developed the Ring of Fire model to explain the origin of orphan γ-ray flares from within blazar jets. In this model, electrons contained within a blob of plasma moving relativistically along the spine of the jet inverse-Compton scatter synchrotron photons emanating off of a ring of shocked sheath plasma that enshrouds the jet spine. As the blob propagates through the ring, the scattering of the ring photons by the blob electrons creates an orphan γ-ray flare. This model was successfully applied to modeling a prominent orphan γ-ray flare observed in the blazar PKS 1510 - 089. To further support the plausibility of this model, Macdonald et al. presented a stacked radio map of PKS 1510 - 089 containing the polarimetric signature of a sheath of plasma surrounding the spine of the jet. In this paper, we extend our modeling and stacking techniques to a larger sample of blazars: 3 C 273, 4 C 71. 01, 3 C 279, 1055 + 018, CTA 102, and 3 C 345, the majority of which have exhibited orphan γ-ray flares. We find that the model can successfully reproduce these <b>flares,</b> while our <b>stacked</b> maps reveal the existence of jet sheaths within these blazars.

40|$|Background: Although {{there is}} {{considerable}} public concern about {{the environmental impacts of}} oil pollution in the Niger Delta of Nigeria, actual evidence on the pathological and psychological effects in the health of local communities is minimally known. We sought to associate the perspective measures of exposure to oil pollution with health outcomes (inventory of health symptoms and functional capacity limitations) and determine how emotional reactions to environmental risks moderate these health outcomes. Method: The study was conducted with 600 participants selected from five local government areas in Akwa Ibom State where oil pollution is rampant. A structured questionnaire was used to collect the data on the respondents’ exposure to oil pollution, self-rated health and disease symptoms, perception of risk of exposure and emotional reactions to local oil pollution. Results: Most of the participants lived in areas with visible oil pollution and/or near gas flaring facilities and regularly suffered direct exposure to oil in their environment. High level of emotional distress was a part of everyone's life for the study population. Risk perception in the study area was mediated, to a large extent, by dreaded hazards (catastrophic fears of pipeline explosions and oil spill fire), visual cues (gas <b>flares</b> and smoke <b>stacks)</b> and chemosensory cues (off-flavor in drinking water). The exposure metrics were found to be significant predictors of the health effects and influencing factors (emotional reactions). Multi-levels models suggest that at the individual level, the demographic variables and direct contact with oil pollution were important mediators of functional capacity limitation. At the community level, emotional distress from fear of the sources of exposure was an important mediator of the health symptoms. Conclusions: This study documents high levels of disease symptoms and environmental distress (worry, annoyance and intolerance) associated with oil pollution in the Niger Delta areas of Nigeria. It highlights the need for some intervention to ameliorate the psychological distress associated with living under such environmental adversity...|$|R
