40|$|The guiding of <b>elastic</b> <b>waves</b> in a {{two-dimensional}} graded phononic crystal plate is investigated. This effect is {{induced by the}} resonance coupling of attachments and matrix in a silicon pillar-substrate system and the resonance frequencies of guided surface modes can be tuned by tailoring the geometry and material properties of the pillars. The resonance frequencies increase with radius and Young’s modulus, and decrease with height and density of the pillars, which provides several possibilities for the guiding of <b>elastic</b> <b>waves.</b> These <b>devices</b> show the capability of spatially selecting different frequencies into designed channels, thus acting as a phononic multi-channel filter...|$|R
40|$|Hyperelastic {{materials}} {{possess the}} appealing property {{that they may}} be employed as <b>elastic</b> <b>wave</b> manipulation <b>devices</b> and cloaks by imposing pre-deformation. They provide an alternative to microstructured metamaterials and {{can be used in a}} reconfigurable manner. Previous studies indicate that exact elastodynamic invariance to pre-deformation holds only for neo-Hookean solids in the antiplane wave scenario and the semi-linear material in the in-plane compressional/shear wave context. Furthermore, although ground cloaks have been considered in the acoustic context they have not yet been discussed for elastodynamics, either by employing microstructured cloaks or hyperelastic cloaks. This work therefore aims at exploring the possibility of employing a range of hyperelastic materials for use as antiplane ground cloaks (AGCs). The use of the popular incompressible Arruda-Boyce and Mooney-Rivlin nonlinear materials is explored. The scattering problem associated with the AGC is simulated via finite element analysis where the cloaked region is formed by an indentation of the surface. Results demonstrate that the neo-Hookean medium can be used to generate a perfect hyperelastic AGC as should be expected. Furthermore, although the AGC performance of the Mooney-Rivlin material is not particularly satisfactory, it is shown that the Arruda-Boyce medium is an excellent candidate material for this purpose...|$|R

Periodically poled transducers (PPTs) have been recently investigated [E. Courjon et al., J. Appl.

PPTs have two principal advantages compared to IDTs: the robustness of the excitation versus defects or surface contamination and the possibility to excite waves exhibiting a wavelength equal to the poling period. Here a new acoustic resonator concept is suggested, allowing high frequency operation with a simplified package. The idea consists of using a waveguide based on a PPT fabricated on a ferroelectric single-crystal substrate such as lithium niobate or tantalate inserted between two single-crystal substrates allowing the guidance of <b>elastic</b> <b>waves</b> without losses.
