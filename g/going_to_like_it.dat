500|$|Ta's {{blind date}} {{proves to be}} the {{thoroughly}} Americanized Linda Low, who we will learn is Sammy Fong's girlfriend and a stripper at his club. [...] On the date with Ta ("I Enjoy Being a Girl"), Linda lies to Ta about her career and family. [...] Ta, knowing that Chinese-Americans with college degrees {{find it hard to}} get a job befitting their education, plans to go to law school, postponing the likely career struggle by three years. [...] The impetuous Ta asks Linda to marry him. [...] She agrees, but she needs family consent and lies, saying that she has a brother who will approve the marriage. [...] Ta returns home and meets Mei Li, who is immediately attracted to him ("I Am <b>Going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Like</b> <b>It</b> Here"), though Ta is unimpressed. [...] That changes when Ta sees her in a Western dress ("Like a God").|$|E
500|$|On {{arrival in}} the United States, Mei-li goes to the Golden Pearl Theatre in San Francisco's Chinatown, where little-attended Chinese opera is {{presented}} by her father's old friend Wang Chi-yang and Wang's foster brother Chin. [...] One night a week, Wang's son Ta turns the theater into a nightclub, starring the very assimilated Linda Low, a Chinese-American stripper from Seattle. [...] Linda's constant companion is a gay costume designer, Harvard (so named by his success-obsessed Chinese parents). [...] The nightclub is profitable; the Chinese opera is not. [...] Mei-li joins the opera company ("I Am <b>Going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Like</b> <b>It</b> Here") and is soon attracted to the indifferent Ta, who favors Linda. [...] Mei-li is fascinated by Linda, who urges her to adopt the American lifestyle ("I Enjoy Being a Girl"). [...] Linda is soon signed by talent agent Rita Liang, who pushes Wang to turn the theater into a club full-time ("Grant Avenue"), and he reluctantly opens Club Chop Suey.|$|E
5000|$|Srijana Mitra Das of The Times of India gave 2.5 out 5 {{and said}} [...] " [...] It has rather modest {{production}} values but some great lines. It retains the traditional love-story (to its detriment) but goes {{out on a}} limb satirizing the political. It's commenting on what's currently happening but in ways not everyone's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>like.</b> <b>It's</b> a cheeky little film - but you may find the laughter a challenge." ...|$|R
500|$|Director Phillip Noyce was {{optimistic about}} a sequel, saying [...] "Hopefully {{within a couple}} of years, we'll have another one. Angelina's so great in this part. When audiences see the movie they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> feel <b>like</b> <b>it's</b> only just the beginning." [...] Producer Lorenzo DiBonaventura also {{expressed}} further interest: [...] "Angie, I know, loved that character, and would love to explore the character some more first and foremost." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] he went on. [...] "It's {{as though}} {{everything}} 'ad changed. More even than when I got my money. 'Ere we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> marry. <b>It's</b> <b>like</b> being someone else. What I feel is----" ...|$|R
500|$|Rodgers and Hammerstein {{sought to}} give the new work an Eastern flavor, without using {{existing}} oriental music. [...] According to Ben Brantley in his review of the 2002 Broadway revival, the use by Rodgers [...] "of repetitive Eastern musical structures gives the numbers a sing-song catchiness that, for better or worse, exerts a sticky hold on the memory." [...] The most oriental-sounding song in the work is [...] "A Hundred Million Miracles", which provides the eight-note drumbeat which is the musical signature of the work from overture to curtain. [...] Hammerstein wrote Mei Li's first act song, [...] "I Am <b>Going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Like</b> <b>It</b> Here", in a Malaysian poetic form called pantoum in which the second and fourth lines of each stanza become {{the first and third}} lines of the next. [...] One critic thought that the 2001 version's orchestrations [...] "boast more Asian accents and a jazzier edge than the original", but another felt that they [...] "pale in comparison" [...] to Bennett's typically lilting sound.|$|E
500|$|SFX {{magazine}} reviewer Russell Lewin gave [...] "The Doctor's Wife" [...] {{four and}} a half out of five stars, labelling it as [...] "non-stop intrigue and controlled suspense all the way". He particularly praised Smith's energetic performance, saying [...] "he pings and fizzes around the screen like a Technicolor firework, lighting up every scene he adorns". IGN's Matt Risley rated the episode 9 out of 10 and concluded, [...] "Sweet, touching, intelligent, different, utterly imaginative and accessible by both hardcore fans and newbies alike— this is not only Doctor Who, but sci-fi telly at its finest". He also praised Gaiman's script for being [...] "a simple idea executed brilliantly". Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times admitted he was unsure if he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> with the [...] "grungy setting, wacko characters and peculiar dialogue", but ended up [...] "captivated". He particularly enjoyed seeing more of the TARDIS' interior and called it an [...] "instant oddball classic".|$|E
500|$|Several of the {{characters}} are given [...] "I am" [...] songs that introduce them to the audience, allowing the character to express his dreams or desires and for onlookers to establish empathy with the character. [...] Linda Low, for example, expresses her self-confidence with [...] "I Enjoy Being a Girl"; we learn Mei Li's hopes with the quieter [...] "I Am <b>Going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Like</b> <b>It</b> Here". [...] Although not a formal musical number, the brief [...] "You Be the Rock, I'll Be the Roll", sung and danced by Linda and by Wang San, Ta's Americanized teenage brother, was described by Lewis as [...] "virtually the first self-consciously rock and roll ditty ever sung" [...] in a Broadway musical. [...] Patrick Adiarte, who originated the role of Wang San, however, saw it as [...] "corny stuff... put in there to get a laugh". [...] Helen Chao's sad [...] "Love, Look Away" [...] is described by Lewis as [...] "arguably the most tautly crafted blues song Dick and Oscar ever wrote".|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} badly mistaken," [...] Dick {{admitted}} with a smile. [...] "Still, I {{know the people}} I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>like.</b> How is <b>it</b> I haven't seen you about?

Obama's President, why can't I run Holby City?" ...He's a maverick who believes in himself. But he's also a teddy bear, a nice guy. Yes, he's a bit short-tempered but it all comes from the heart.

500|$|On September 27, 2012, Big Sean {{announced}} his second studio album {{with the title}} Hall of Fame: Memoirs of a Detroit Player, and then has announced a release date for December 2012. Sean explains why chose {{this to be the}} title, stating that [...] "its because it'll represent who he is". He then said that he feels [...] "like situations are really going to be relatable to people." [...] He then stated that he [...] "didn't want to just do another club song", and he didn't even wanted to follow these popular music standards. [...] "This is just what the fuck I want to do. Some people are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> Some people are going to hate it; regardless, I'm just doing me." [...] Sean then said that Hall of Fame will be a far more inspirational and a more conceptually-driven project than his debut album. He even went on by saying the fact that he wants to teach, while making his lasting impact on peoples' lives with this second album. During an interview with Power 105, Sean stated that he would include some skits on the album to give it a [...] "classic feel". He even indicated that the song [...] "Mula" [...] featuring French Montana (which also this track was included on the mixtape Detroit), could be featuring as the track for his deluxe edition.|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "All In My Head (Flex)" [...] fuses reggae and pop with trap music. The song {{is three}} minutes and thirty-seconds {{in length and}} samples the song [...] "Flex" [...] by Jamaican DJ Mad Cobra which itself {{interpolated}} elements of The Temptations' [...] "Just My Imagination". Its instrumentation consists of guitar, percussion, synthesized finger snaps and synths creating an electronic-reggae beat. The song opens with Hansen singing the chorus featuring guitar chords and crisp clicks. Following the rap performed by Fetty Wap, Ally Brooke belts out [...] the first verse: [...] "Curtains like waves closing in all around us, dimming the lights just so that they don't blind us," [...] backed by the percussion and guitar chords. Concerning his collaboration on [...] "All in My Head (Flex)", Fetty Wap told Billboard that during the recording, his voice [...] "wasn't as mature as it is now." [...] And described as [...] "impossible" [...] to performed the song on stage. [...] "Like, I smoke way too much now. No more high-range. If you were actually to hear the first version to that song, I do not sound anything like that. It was way high up there. So when we changed everything I was like I don't think they <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> because it felt like I took the energy from it. But they were like we love it, we rocking with it." [...] He expressed.|$|E

5000|$|Henderson said [...] "I {{think this}} is {{probably}} the most excited I have been in a long time, [...] "Light Up the Dark" [...] gives you a sneak peek into what the album is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> sound <b>like</b> and <b>it’s</b> so awesome that it was a part of such a cool Aussie film!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Williams told an {{interviewer}} {{at the time that}} he was excited the album was being released by Atco. [...] "It's a label for rock 'n' rollers, but they're very excited about the album.

2500|$|For the {{recording}} of their next studio album, the Replacements {{decided to return to}} Blackberry Way Studios in late 1983. The band considered R.E.M.'s guitarist Peter Buck as producer, but when they met him in Athens, Georgia, they did not have enough material to begin recording. Instead, Jesperson and Steve Fjelstad co-produced the album. By this time, the Replacements had grown tired of playing loud and fast exclusively; Westerberg stated, [...] "Now we're softening a little where we can do something that's a little more sincere without being afraid that someone's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> or the punks aren't {{going to be able to}} dance to it." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the album}} was assembled, Brian brought a {{complete}} acetate to Marilyn, who remembers, [...] "It was so beautiful, {{one of the most}} spiritual times of my whole life. We both cried. Right after we listened to it, he said he was scared that nobody was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> That it was too intricate." [...] Pet Sounds was released on May 16, debuting on the Billboard charts at 106. Compared to their previous albums in the US, Pet Sounds achieved dramatically less commercial success; it peaked at No. 10 on the Billboard LP chart, with sales estimated at around 500,000 units. Pet Sounds initial release was not awarded gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In February 2000, Pet Sounds was presented with gold and platinum awards based on sales that could be documented, although Capitol Records estimated it may have sold over two million copies.|$|E
2500|$|In the Observer interview, Hewlett {{said that}} there is [...] "a new project which Damon and I are working on now, called Carousel, which is even bigger and more {{difficult}} than , and it isn't going to fit anywhere and no one's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> ha ha ha! We've started work— I've {{done a lot of}} visuals and Damon's done a lot of music but we haven't figured out how they're going to fit together. I can't say much about it yet but it's sort of like a film, but not with one narrative story. There's many stories, told around a bigger story, set to music, and done in live action, animation, all different styles, well... originally it was a film but now we think it's a film and it's a stage thing as well and... look, it's basically us doing what the fuck we want without worrying about whether it's for a record company or a film company or whatever. So I'm not sure how it'll pan out, or even if it will happen. But Damon's written around 70 songs for it, and I've got great plans for the visuals, but right now, at this moment, it's still just a really good idea." [...] Carousel was to be about the mystical aspects of Britain.|$|E
5000|$|... "It's never a {{thing with}} any of these albums of knowing what they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> sound <b>like.</b> <b>It's</b> more <b>like</b> knowing the kind of feel you want. The one kind of {{starting}} point we had this time was just this thing of everyone working in their own little time zone. Really, it's just <b>going</b> back <b>to</b> one of a couple of things - either the jazz ethic or y'know, an album like Tago Mago by Can, where the drummer locked-in and off he went and people reacted at certain points along the way. It's arranged spontaneity - that's exactly what it is." [...] Mark Hollis discussing the production.|$|R

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of 'The Fire Sermon' in one version, there was a lengthy section in heroic couplets, in imitation of Alexander Pope's The Rape of the Lock.
