Sephardim also add spices such as cumin and hot peppers.|$|E
25|$|Behind {{the mold}} disk {{is the type}} metal pot, which {{contains}} molten type metal. A piston in the pot pushes the molten metal down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pot,</b> which forces the metal through the pot throat and into the mold, forcing it against {{the faces of the}} matrices. These have character shapes cut into them, so the result is a cast slug with the character shapes of the line on its front face. The mold disk is sometimes water-cooled, and often air-cooled with a blower, to carry away the heat of the molten type metal and allow the cast slugs to solidify quickly.|$|E

25|$|The Fenjaan {{consisted}} of a large pot full of water and a bowl with a small hole in the center. When the bowl became full of water, it would sink <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pot,</b> and the manager would empty the bowl and again {{put it on the}} top of the water in the pot. He would record the number of times the bowl sank by putting small stones into a jar. The place where the clock was situated, and its managers, were collectively known as khaneh Fenjaan. Usually this would be the top floor of a public-house, with west- and east-facing windows to show the time of Sunset and Sunrise. There was also another time-keeping tool named a staryab or astrolabe, but it was mostly used for superstitious beliefs and was not practical for use as a farmers' calendar. The Zeebad Gonabad water clock was in use until 1965 when it was substituted by modern clocks.|$|E
25|$|Over time, {{other sites}} started to expand beyond eSports betting and instead offered betting on games of chance. Jackpot-like sites were introduced, where users can put their skins <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pot,</b> which {{will end in}} one person winning. The higher total value, the more chance the user would have to win. A few sites reduced the {{gambling}} to betting on {{the result of a}} single coin flip. Some sites also offered unopened weapon crates for purchase with skins. In combination with the gambling features, players could then trade skins they won for their cash value through these sites, or purchase skins with currency to gamble further. The exact timing for the growth of these gambling sites is unclear, but Chris Grove, an analyst for Eilers & Krejcik Gaming and Narus Advisors, observed as early as August 2015 that skins were being used for betting on eSports. At that time, the use of skins for gambling on more traditional games-of-chance was not readily apparent.|$|E
500|$|... "The Terror of Tiny Toon" [...] {{includes}} a live-action segment starring Regis Philbin and Kathie Lee Gifford of Live with Regis and Kathie Lee. The segment {{was directed by}} Donick Cary. In the sequence, Itchy, Scratchy, Bart and Lisa fall into a pot of soup that Regis and Kathie Lee are making. The soup splash was created by dropping an item <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pot,</b> then adding the animated characters over it. The taping of this segment took longer than expected, so a broadcast of WABC-TV's Eyewitness News that was to take place (the show was {{and continues to be}} taped at the facilities of WABC in New York, where it originated in 1983) had to be moved to another studio. Jerry Springer also guest stars in the episode as himself. His lines were recorded by Julie Thacker.|$|E

50|$|Subirrigation {{offers another}} {{alternative}} to top-watering techniques.

Advantages of this technique include controlled amounts of water, resulting in lower chances of overwatering if done correctly, no need to drain plants after watering unlike traditional top-water methods, and less compaction of the media due to the pressure put on the media from top-watering.|$|R

The positive electrode (the cathode) consisted of crushed manganese dioxide {{with a little}} carbon mixed in. The negative pole (anode) was a zinc rod. The cathode was packed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pot,</b> and a carbon rod was inserted {{to act as a}} current collector. The anode and the pot were then immersed in an ammonium chloride solution. The liquid acted as the electrolyte, readily seeping through the porous pot and making contact with the cathode material.

Marge convinces him to take a walk with her to the Springfield Wall of Fame. Eventually, he agrees and learns that his name has been put up. Marge reveals that she confronted Dondelinger and forced him to do the right thing. A boy then has his picture taken with him. Homer, now much happier, goes to a Korean restaurant that Bart says 'sells beef that spells the date of your death'.|$|E
2500|$|Ulliott {{arrived at}} the 1997 World Series of Poker (WSOP) with $200,000, but lost it all on cash games and tournament buy-ins. He {{borrowed}} over $70,000 more, but lost this too, burning some bridges in the process. He scraped together a buy-in for the $2,000 pot limit Texas hold 'em event, where he reached heads-up against fellow Englishman Chris Truby. In the final hand, Ulliott got all of his money in the pot with an open-ended straight draw and flush draw against Truby's top set. Ulliott won with a straight on the river to claim $180,310 and his only WSOP bracelet. Whitaker jumped over the barricade {{to join in the}} celebrations.

2500|$|On March 2, 2012, ESPN's Adam Schefter {{reported}} that the NFL had indeed found evidence of a bounty program. Later that day, the NFL announced it had obtained irrefutable proof of a bounty pool {{dating back to the}} 2009 season, based on a review of 18,000 documents. It determined that Williams had initiated the fund soon after he arrived in New Orleans in 2009, in hopes of making the defense more aggressive. Between 22 and 27 Saints defensive players were involved. The players and Williams contributed their own cash to the pot, and received cash payments based on their performance in the previous week's game. For instance, a special teamer who downed a kick returner inside the receiving team's 20-yard-line earned $100. Players could also be fined for mental mistakes and penalties. Players also received [...] "bounties" [...] for [...] "cart-offs" [...] (plays in which an opponent was removed from the field on a stretcher or cart) and [...] "knockouts" [...] (plays that resulted in a player being unable to return {{for the rest of the}} game). Players usually earned $1,000 for [...] "cart-offs" [...] and $1,500 for [...] "knockouts" [...] during the regular season, though they were encouraged to put their winnings back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pot</b> in order to raise the stakes as the season went on.
