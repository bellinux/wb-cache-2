Endocarditis is not common in companion or wild animal species. 12 Most cases of endocarditis in animals are second-ary to bacterial infection, but various fungal or parasitic in-fections can also be involved. 12 Among pinnipeds, only a single case of endocarditis {{associated with}} <b>Erysipelothrix</b> <b>rhusiopathiae</b> <b>infection</b> in a seal has been described. 6 Bac-terial infections are important causes of morbidity and mor-tality in marine mammals. 3, 11, 13 However, their role in path-ogenesis of disease is difficult to determine, and it is often hard to establish whether a particular bacterium is a primary or secondary pathogen. 3, 11, 13 A few cases of bacterial diseas-es, including tuberculosis, leptospirosis, and placentitis du...|$|E

In contrast to porcine isolates, molecular epidemiological traits of avian E. rhusiopathiae isolates are less well known. Thus, we aimed to (i) develop a multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme for E. rhusiopathiae, (ii) study the congruence of strain grouping based on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and MLST, (iii) determine the diversity of the dominant immunogenic protein SpaA, and (iv) examine the distribution of genes putatively linked with virulence among field isolates from poultry (120), swine (24) and other hosts (21), including humans (3). Using seven housekeeping genes for MLST analysis we determined 72 sequence types (STs) among 165 isolates. This indicated an overall high diversity, though 34. 5 % of all isolates belonged to a single predominant ST-complex, STC 9, which grouped strains from birds and mammals, including humans, together. PFGE revealed 58 different clusters and congruence with the sequence-based MLST-method was not common. Based on polymorphisms in the N-terminal hyper-variable region of SpaA the isolates were classified into five groups, which followed the phylogenetic background of the strains.

Results: Penicillin and ceftriaxone, with low minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) (MIC 90 0. 03 mg/l and 0. 125 mg/l, respectively), remained active against E. rhusiopathiae and should continue to be recommended for treatment.

This microbe has caused great {{economic}} losses in China {{and in other}} countries. In this study, high-throughput cDNA microarray assays were employed to evaluate the host responses of porcine heart to E. rhusiopathiae and to gain additional insights into its pathogenesis. A total of 394 DE transcripts were detected in the active virulent E. <b>rhusiopathiae</b> <b>infection</b> group compared with the PBS group at 4 days post-infection. Moreover, 262 transcripts were upregulated and 132 transcripts were downregulated. Differentially expressed genes were involved in many vital functional classes, including inflammatory and immune responses, signal transduction, apoptosis, transport, protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, metabolic processes, chemotaxis, cell adhesion, and innate immune responses. Pathway analysis demonstrated that the most significant pathways were Chemokine signaling pathway, NF-kappa B signaling pathway, TLR pathway, CAMs, systemic lupus erythematosus, chemokine signaling pathway, Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, PI 3 K-Akt signaling pathway, Phagosome, HTLV-I infection, Measles, Rheumatoid arthritis and natural-killer-cell-mediated cytotoxicity.
