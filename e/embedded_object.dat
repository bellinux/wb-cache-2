50|$|Before third {{generation}} technology, {{it was common}} for organizations to be required to use multiple documents for one product. A main document with various supporting documents {{would be used to}} present and share necessary information. However, the {{third generation}} of documents (especially Microsoft Word) enabled multiple types of information to be presented in a single document. Compound documents could include text, tables, and various styles, and could also include a range of <b>embedded</b> <b>objects,</b> such as Excel, Visio, ChemDraw, and SmartDraw objects, and inserted images in a range of types (including jpg, tiff, bmp, and gif). While this enhancement greatly increased the usefulness of documents, it added an entirely new layer of risk to organizations that needed to fully understand changes made to document versions. The majority of document comparison software programs have not yet included mechanisms to mitigate the risk related to changes inside of <b>embedded</b> <b>objects.</b> The software program that can compare changes made in <b>embedded</b> <b>objects</b> provides pixel-to-pixel comparison of images and cell-level comparison of embedded Excel spreadsheets and other changes made to these complex, compound documents.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Web {{prefetching}} {{is one of}} {{the techniques}} proposed to reduce user’s perceived latencies in the World Wide Web. The spatial locality shown by user’s accesses makes it possible to predict future accesses based on the previous ones. A prefetching engine uses these predictions to prefetch the web objects before the user demands them. The existing prediction algorithms achieved an acceptable performance when they were proposed but the high increase in the amount of <b>embedded</b> <b>objects</b> per page has reduced their effectiveness in the current web. In this paper we show that most of the predictions made by the existing algorithms are useless to reduce the user’s perceived latency because these algorithms do not take into account how current web pages are structured, i. e., an HTML <b>object</b> with several <b>embedded</b> <b>objects.</b> Thus, they predict the accesses to the <b>embedded</b> <b>objects</b> in an HTML after reading the HTML itself. For this reason, the prediction advance is not enough to prefetch the objects and therefore there is no latency reduction. As a result of a wide analysis of the behaviour of the most commonly used algorithms, in this paper we present the DDG algorithm that distinguishes between container <b>objects</b> (HTML) and <b>embedded</b> <b>objects</b> to create a new prediction model according to the structure of the current web. Results show that, for the same amount of extra requests to the server, DDG always outperforms the existing algorithms by reducing the perceived latency between 15 % and 150 % more without increasing the computing complexity.
