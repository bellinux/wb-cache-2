500|$|By 1931, Two Guns White Calf, son of {{the last}} Blackfoot tribal chief, was capitalizing off his {{claim to be the}} model for the coin. To try {{to put an end to}} the claim, Fraser wrote that he had used three Indians for the piece, {{including}} [...] "Iron Tail, the best Indian head <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember.</b> <b>The</b> other one was Two Moons, the other I cannot recall." [...] In 1938, Fraser stated that the three Indians had been [...] "Iron Tail, a Sioux, Big Tree, a Kiowa, and Two Moons, a Cheyenne". [...] Despite the sculptor's efforts, he (and the Mint) continued to receive inquiries about the identity of the Indian model until his 1953 death.|$|E
2500|$|In Running Rugby Mark Ella {{writes of}} Campese's debut that, [...] "Campese played his first Test on that tour. The match was at Christchurch, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> {{occasion}} very clearly. Until that match, Stu Wilson of New Zealand reigned as the world's champion winger, but I think his reign ended that day. Campese {{turned it on}} with the goose-step and trumped Wilson completely. We all knew then that someone really special had come on the scene.|$|E
2500|$|Bernhardt had a {{remarkable}} ability to memorize a role quickly. She recounted in L'Art du Théâtre that [...] "I {{only have to}} read a role {{two or three times}} and I know it completely; but the day that I stop playing the piece the role escapes me entirely... My memory can't contain several parts at the same time, and it's impossible for me to recite off-hand a tirade from Phèdre or Hamlet. And yet <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> smallest events from my childhood." [...] She also suffered, particularly early in her career, bouts of memory loss and stage fright. Once, she was seriously ill before a performance of L'Etrangére at the Gaiety Theater in London, and the doctor gave her a dose of painkiller, either opium or morphine. During the performance, she went on stage, but could not remember what she was supposed to say. She turned to another actress, and announced, [...] "If I made you come here, Madame, it is because I wanted to instruct you in what I want done... I have thought about it, and I do not want to tell you today", then walked offstage. The other actors, astonished, quickly improvised an ending to the scene. After a brief rest, her memory came back, and Bernhardt went back on stage, and completed the play.|$|E

60|$|The hotel (a very {{excellent}} one) {{is called}} the Tremont House. It has more galleries, colonnades, piazzas, and passages than <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember,</b> or <b>the</b> reader would believe.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll try it!" [...] {{cried the}} boy, jumping up. [...] "But I wonder if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> words old Mombi said, {{and the way}} she held her hands up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's too bad. So far as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>{{remember}},</b> <b>the</b> {{ship was}} all right when I saw her. If I remember rightly, however, our captain said {{he thought she was}} pretty far north for a whaler." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Coulson laughed, {{and made}} a little half-petulant gesture. [...] "I fancied you did not deserve to hear it when you could not {{contrive}} to come forty miles to see me. Still, I think <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> day. Shafton {{had to be in}} Vancouver on the Wednesday----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I wish I {{could manage}} to be glad!' the Queen said. 'Only <b>I</b> never <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> rule. You {{must be very}} happy, living in this wood, and being glad {{whenever}} you like!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You shouldn't drink so much, Almayer," [...] said Willems, disguising his fury {{under an}} {{affected}} drawl. [...] "You have no head. Never had, {{as far as}} <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember,</b> in <b>the</b> old days in Macassar. You drink too much." ...|$|R
60|$|This tardy {{favourite}} of fortune--hobbling a little, I think, as if {{in memory}} of the sciatica, but with not a trace that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> of <b>the</b> sea--thoroughly ruralised from head to foot, proceeded to escort us up the hill behind his house.|$|R
6000|$|... “Yes; I {{often feel}} that, when I {{think of the}} hard {{struggle}} she must have had. Though I was very young then, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> shabby boardinghouses we stayed in, and my mother’s pale, anxious face when she and {{my father used to}} talk in the evenings. He seldom speaks about those days, but I know he does not forget.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I really feel," [...] he said, {{as he drew}} on {{his gloves}} thoughtfully, [...] "that I must repeat my {{congratulations}} to you, Mr. Jarvis, and to your young coadjutor here, Mr. Chetwode. The results which I have {{had the pleasure of}} laying before you are quite excellent. In fact, so far as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember,</b> <b>the</b> firm has scarcely ever had a more prosperous half year." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Jack," [...] I said, trembling, [...] "in {{spite of}} this shock, I believe I can do it now. I believe <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember.</b> <b>The</b> scales are falling from my eyes. I'm {{becoming}} myself again. What you've said and what you've shown me seems to have broken down a veil. I feel as if I could reconstruct all now, when once the key's suggested to me." ...|$|E
60|$|We go {{rustling}} {{through the}} grass to the prostrate timber she has chosen. (<b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> even <b>the</b> thin bracelet on the wrist of the hand that lifted her skirt.) I help her to clamber into a comfortable fork from which her feet can swing....|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Alison {{with some}} reluctance, [...] "I don't think he did. So far as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember,</b> <b>I</b> volunteered <b>the</b> information." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's nothing I {{like so much}} as a garden, only <b>I</b> never <b>can</b> <b>{{remember}}</b> <b>the</b> {{names of}} the flowers. They've got such grand names down here. When I was a boy, in Warwickshire, they used to have nothing but roses and sweetwilliams. One could remember them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm flattered, I assure you. But--let me see--what happened? Well, riding, lessons, sisters. There was an enchanted rubbish heap, I remember, {{where all}} kinds of queer things happened. Odd, what things impress {{children}}! <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> look of the place to this day. It's a fallacy to think that children are happy. They're not; they're unhappy. I've never suffered so much as I did when I was a child." ...|$|E
60|$|I thought, after {{swallowing}} {{the first}} mouthful, that I would not eat {{any more of}} this cheese. Then {{it occurred to me}} that it was a pity to waste it after having ordered it, and, besides, I might get to like it before I had finished. The taste for most of the good things of this world has to be acquired. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> time when I did not like beer.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have a very}} vague idea. The prior had a map of Normandy, and on this {{he pointed}} out to me how the duchy had grown since William came as a boy to be its duke. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> general {{position}} of the town, but not more than that. I should think from the Somme to Rouen must be over seventy miles and less than a hundred, but more closely than that I cannot guess." ...|$|E
5000|$|..... {{it takes}} me back to <b>the</b> first Christmas <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember,</b> when <b>the</b> {{grandmother}} <b>I</b> hadn't yet met, who was Indian and lived in England, sent me a box. For me it still carries the taste of strangeness and confusion and wonder. Harold McGee, author of On Food and Cooking ...|$|R

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> bare wooden {{stairway}} in my uncle's house, and {{the turn}} to the left above the landing, and the rafters and the slanting roof over my bed, and the squares of moonlight on the floor, and the white cold world of snow outside, seen through the curtainless window. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> howling {{of the wind and}} the quaking of the house on stormy nights, and how snug and cozy one felt, under the blankets, listening, and how the powdery snow used to sift in, around the sashes, and lie in little ridges on the floor, and make the place look chilly in the morning, and curb the wild desire to get up--in case there was any. I can remember how very dark that room was, in the dark of the moon, and how packed it was with ghostly stillness when one woke up by accident away in the night, and forgotten sins came flocking out of the secret chambers of the memory and wanted a hearing; and how ill chosen the time seemed for this kind of business; and how dismal was the hoo-hooing of the owl and the wailing of the wolf, sent mourning by on the night wind.|$|E
6000|$|... 'A very able man. A very able man indeed. I'm afraid he's {{not popular}} in the office. A little inclined, perhaps, to be hard on mistakes. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> {{time when he was}} quite different. He and I were fellow clerks in Morton and Blatherwick's. He got on better than I did. A great fellow for getting on. They say he is to be the Unionist {{candidate}} for Kenningford when the time comes. A great worker, but perhaps not quite the sort of man to be generally popular in an office.' ...|$|E
60|$|Oh, ignorant young creatures! How little do {{you know}} the effect of rack punch! What is the rack in the punch, at night, to the rack in the head of a morning? To this truth I can vouch as a man; there is no {{headache}} in the world like that caused by Vauxhall punch. Through the lapse of twenty years, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> consequence of two glasses! two wine-glasses! but two, upon the honour of a gentleman; and Joseph Sedley, who had a liver complaint, had swallowed at least a quart of the abominable mixture.|$|E
5000|$|... "It was beautiful, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> because <b>the</b> {{roof was}} round {{and white and}} pristine. It was like playing in a cloud. Imagine, it's almost like you're playing in the Vatican. It was very unique."

5000|$|As soon as I had {{finished}} my supper, an Indian {{took off my}} shoes and stockings, and put a pair of moccasins on my feet, which my mother observed; and believing that they would spare my life, even if they should destroy the other captives, addressed me, as near as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember,</b> in <b>the</b> following words: ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2014 Obama {{said that}} only a two-state {{solution}} could ensure Israel's future as a Jewish-majority democracy.

6000|$|... "I {{know now}} how vain, how vile I was. I always know {{afterwards}} how low the spirit has grovelled. I {{had gone to}} him then because I had resolved to humble myself, and, for my wife's sake, to ask my friend--for money. With words which were very awkward,--which no doubt were ungracious--I had asked him, and he had bid me follow him from his hall into his library. There he left me awhile, and on returning told me {{with a smile that}} he had sent for money,--and, if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember,</b> <b>the</b> sum he named was fifty pounds." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What I sez," [...] said Friesshardt, [...] "is, wot's {{the use of}} us wasting {{our time}} here?" [...] (Friesshardt {{was not a very}} well-educated man, and he did not speak good grammar.) [...] "None of these here people ain't a-going to bow down to that there hat. Of course they ain't. Why, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> time when this meadow was like a fair--everybody a-shoving and a-jostling one another for elbow-room; and look at it now! It's a desert.

[...] "He got my number, the old hayseed, he was laying for me, and the next time I went back that way he held me up for five dollars. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> time when a man in a motor was an easy mark for every reuben in the county.
