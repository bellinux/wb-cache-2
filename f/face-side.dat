50|$|It is now {{illegal for}} any hockey stick {{to have a}} bow that exceeds 25 mm. The bow height is {{measured}} by placing the stick <b>face-side</b> to a flat surface and presenting the official measuring device, a 25 mm-high metal triangular or cylindrical measure, to {{the gap between the}} surface and the under-flat of the stick.|$|E
50|$|Let's Tap {{consists}} {{of a number of}} minigames that requires the player to tap a flat surface with their hands to play. The game requires the player to set the Wii Remote <b>face-side</b> down on a flat, stable surface, with the accelerometer picking up their vibrations as they tap the surface to move an on screen character in a race, inflate a balloon, create ripples in a pool of water or paint swirls on a canvas.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{records that}} portray the {{determination}} of earlier names of Farab. It is thought {{that a group of}} coins collected in Otrar and some towns of the oasis date back to the time of these records. There is a generic symbol of the Turgeshi {{in the form of a}} bow on the <b>face-side</b> of such coins and the image of a lion on the reverse side. On a second type of coin, there is an [...] "X" [...] sign on the reverse side; these may originate from the mint of a local ruler. There is a suggestion that the coins of the second type were minted by rulers of the Turkic state of Kangu Tarban, the population of which were the Kangars. According to the coins, in the 6th to 8th centuries, Kangu Tarban was ruled by a local dynasty of the Kangars, and their capital became a Tarban town named Turarband that was later to be called Otrar. Since the times of the golden hordes, the ruins of Otrar have been attractive because of rumours about the treasures of the ancient rulers, and about buried piles of gold coins and jewelry. The source of such legends was perhaps confirmed by the archaeological finds of various coins and jewelry.|$|E
50|$|It has a {{total length}} of 8-10 cm (3-4 in). The {{relatively}} long, slightly decurved bill is black with flesh-colored (occasionally orange) base {{to the lower}} mandible. The tail is coppery-green with a dark subterminal band. The upperparts and flanks are coppery-green. The central underparts and crissum (the undertail coverts surrounding the cloaca) are white. The color of the throat, <b>face-sides</b> and crown varies greatly both individually and depending on subspecies. The throat ranges from all greenish or turquoise (edged white in female) in inland nominate, nitidifrons and kubtcheki, to bluish in rondoniae and white (essentially {{a continuation of the}} white central underparts) in coastal nominate, hollandi and millerii. Most races have green <b>face-sides</b> and crown, but this is typically turquoise-blue or azure blue in hollandi and rondoniae.|$|R
5000|$|Juvenile males {{resemble}} the adult female, but gradually develop first the red crown, then the black <b>face-sides,</b> {{and finally the}} remaining plumage of the adult male. The males form leks, typically consisting of a single adult and two sub-adult males, where they sing and [...] "dance" [...] to attract females. This was shown in the BBC's The Life of Birds documentary series. Due to the pronounced hypergamous nature of its females, up to 90% of male blue manakins may go through their entire lives as permavirgins.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the cooling effect from the {{transpiration}} of leaves, we measured {{the temperature of the}} <b>face-side</b> surface of leaves which were attached to a polyethylene sheet on the back half-side of the leaves, as well as using a thermo-camera, using simple radiation thermometers which are found in the science classes of elementary and lower secondary schools. After taking the measurements, the leaves were directly measured for amount of starch accumulated through photoshynthesis, using Tatakizome method. This experimental method for students provides a new tool for the creation of teaching materials which foster scientific thinking...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we explore}} {{the effect of}} {{particle}} shape angularity on the mechanical behavior of sheared granular packings. A first series of contact dynamics simulations is performed in 2 D with regular polygons with {{an increasing number of}} sides ranging from 3 (triangles) to 60. Then, in order to approach "idealized" angular particles, a second series of simulations is performed in 3 D with irregular polyhedra with the number of faces ranging from 8 (octahedron-like) to 596. A counterintuitive finding is that the shear strength increases with angularity up to a maximum value and saturates as the particles become more angular (below 6 sides in 2 D and 46 faces in 3 D). A micromechanical analysis of force and contact orientations, all enhanced by face-face and <b>face-side</b> contacts, reveals that this increase is due to an increase of both contact and force anisotropies, and the saturation for higher angularities is a consequence of a rapid fall-off of the contact and normal force anisotropies compensated by an increase of the tangential force anisotropy...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe use contact dynamic {{simulations}} {{to perform}} a systematic investigation {{of the effects of}} particles shape angularity on mechanicals response in sheared granular ma-terials. The particles are irregular polyhedra with varying numbers of face from spheres to "double pyramid" shape with a constant aspect ratio. We study the quasi-static behav-ior, structural and force anisotropies of several packings subjected to triaxial compression. An interesting finding is that the shear strength first increases with angularity up to a maximum value and then saturates as the particles become more angular. Analyzing the anisotropies induced by the angular distributions of contacts and forces orientations, we show that the saturation of the shear strength at higher angularities is a consequence of fall-off of the texture anisotropies compensated by an increase of the tangential force anisotropy. This is attributed to the fact that at higher angularity, particles are bet-ter connected (or surrounded) leading to an increase of friction mobilization in order to achieve the deformation. Moreover, the most angular particles also have very few sides so that, this effect is enhanced by the increase of the proportion of <b>face-side</b> and side-side contacts with angularity...|$|E
