50|$|The Sydarm was {{originally}} developed for police training, featuring a horizontal magazine and <b>integrated</b> 12g <b>adapter.</b> Within {{a year of}} its introduction to the public, AGD restricted its sales of the sydarm to police only. Sydarms are now a collector's item.|$|R
5000|$|RTP-MIDI {{has been}} {{included}} in Arduino open platform in November 2013 (under the name [...] "AppleMIDI library"). The software module can run either on Arduino modules with <b>integrated</b> Ethernet <b>adapter</b> (like the Intel Galileo) or run on the [...] "Ethernet shield".|$|R
50|$|Photometers {{are used}} to {{determine}} the correct exposure in photography. In modern cameras, the photometer is usually built in. As the illumination of different parts of the picture varies, advanced photometers measure the light intensity {{in different parts of the}} potential picture and use an algorithm to determine the most suitable exposure for the final picture, adapting the algorithm to the type of picture intended (see Metering mode). Historically, a photometer was separate from the camera and known as an exposure meter. The advanced photometers then could be used either to measure the light from the potential picture as a whole, to measure from elements of the picture to ascertain that the most important parts of the picture are optimally exposed, or to measure the incident light to the scene with an <b>integrating</b> <b>adapter.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Accelerator Business Objects and Services {{implements}} {{a framework}} that consists of server-side Business Objects, Presentation and Data Service Buses, and Service Adapters.

50|$|Beginning {{with its}} 1964 System/360 {{announcement}} IBM's mainframes initially accessed CKD (Count key data) subsystems via a channel connected to separate Storage Control Units (SCUs) with attached Direct Access Storage Devices (DASD), typically a hard disk drive. This practice continued in IBM's larger mainframes thru System/370; however low end systems generally used lower cost integrated attachments where {{the function of}} the SCU was combined with that of the channel, typically called an <b>Integrated</b> File <b>Adapter.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2002/2003, the GreenChip II TEA155x {{series was}} released. Derived from the TEA1507, the new series was {{specifically}} aimed at notebook adapters. The GreenChip II series {{was capable of}} reducing notebook adapter no-load power to below 500 mW (a 100% improvement on the state-of-the-art 1 W at that time). It also improved system robustness by <b>integrating</b> more <b>adapter</b> specific protections and signaling conditioning functionality. The TEA155x grew to take a dominant share in the notebook adapter market.|$|R
50|$|In a VTAM network, {{communication}} {{took place}} through an <b>integrated</b> communication <b>adapter</b> in the mainframe itself, or by a separate programmable front-end processor, the IBM 3745/3746 Communications Processor, {{with its own}} operating system, the Network Control Program NCP. These machines are no longer actively marketed by IBM, but are still supported. IBM provides hardware maintenance and microcode updates for the estimated 20,000 installed 3745/3746 controllers. A robust third party industry of smaller 3745/3746 specialty companies provide such controllers, upgrades, features, and related support services. VTAM and SNA are still in use by many enterprises.|$|R
50|$|The {{previous}} Intel integrated graphics solution, Intel GMA, had {{a reputation}} of lacking performance and features, and therefore was {{not considered to be}} a good choice for more demanding graphics applications, such as 3D gaming. The performance increases brought by Intel's HD Graphics made the products competitive with <b>integrated</b> graphics <b>adapters</b> made by its rivals, Nvidia and ATI/AMD. Intel HD Graphics, featuring minimal power consumption that is important in laptops, was capable enough that PC manufacturers often stopped offering discrete graphics options in their low-end and mid-range laptop lines.|$|R
50|$|In Germany, ISDN {{was very}} popular with an {{installed}} base of 25 million channels (29% of all subscriber lines in Germany as of 2003 and 20% of all ISDN channels worldwide). Due {{to the success of}} ISDN, the number of installed analog lines was decreasing. Deutsche Telekom (DTAG) offered both BRI and PRI. Competing phone companies often offered ISDN only and no analog lines. However, these operators generally offered free hardware that also allows the use of POTS equipment, such as NTBAs with <b>integrated</b> terminal <b>adapters.</b> Because of the widespread availability of ADSL services, ISDN was primarily used for voice and fax traffic.|$|R
50|$|In February 2006, {{the company}} {{agreed to buy}} the IP and {{business}} assets from Xyratex, a move which helped raise the profile of Napatech vis-Ã -vis programmable network accelerators. Napatech successfully <b>integrated</b> the Ethernet <b>adapter</b> business from Xyratex, subsequently generating US$4 million in revenue, while an additional US$5 million in new capital was raised from Northzone and Ferd Venture.|$|R
50|$|The second {{motherboard}} {{series in}} this form factor, the P700 series improves upon the PX10000G series by offering Gigabit Ethernet (Using the VIA VT6122 chipset) or a 10/100 Ethernet adapter (VIA VT6107) as a manufacturing option, <b>integrating</b> the power <b>adapter</b> (allowing for direct +12V DC-In & enabling it to directly power SATA), and making the Ethernet & VGA ports optional via the P700-A daughter card.|$|R
500|$|At E3 2010, Microsoft {{revealed}} a new US$299.99 Xbox 360 SKU known officially as the Xbox 360 S {{and referred to}} as the [...] "Slim" [...] by various media outlets. It replaced the Elite and comes with an <b>integrated</b> 802.11n WLAN <b>adapter,</b> <b>integrated</b> TOSLINK port, 5 USB ports and a 250GB HDD. It also does not require an additional power supply to make use of Microsoft Kinect motion control accessory. A US$199.99 version was released on August 3, 2010 in the US which replaced the Arcade model. It has 4GB and a 250GB model of internal memory, it has a matte or glossy finish and it comes with a headset. At E3 2013 Microsoft revealed the Xbox 360 E, the final iteration of the Xbox 360 series, to be succeeded by Xbox One. The Xbox 360 E was originally priced at US$199.99 for a 4GB model, and US$299.99 for the 250GB model. The 360 E featured a new square design with a simplified exterior akin to the Xbox One.|$|R

40|$|As {{the high}} {{luminosity}} {{phase of the}} LHC is approaching, the CMS collaboration started research for the future silicon sensor baseline for the CMS Tracker phase II upgrade. Wafers of various materials (float-zone, magnetic czochralski and epitaxial), thicknesses from 320 Î¼ m down to 50 Î¼ m and n-bulk or p-bulk doping have been ordered at one manufacturer, HPK, for good comparison. Alongside, the feasibility of processing sensors with double metal routing on 6 " wafers is explored. Different structures answer different questions covering aspects from radiation hardness to layout issues in this evaluation. A mixed irradiation program with protons and neutrons probes radiation hardness representing a mixture of charged and neutral hadrons expected in the CMS tracker after an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb^- 1 at several radii. This contribution gives {{an overview of the}} first proton irradiated diodes. Furthermore, a sensor with <b>integrated</b> pitch <b>adapter</b> on a second metal layer is characterised and presented for the first time...|$|R
40|$|The {{spatial and}} {{semantic}} integration of tangible user interfaces (TUI) into virtual environments is a promising approach to enhance mixed reality-applications with dynamic three-dimensional graphics and graspable controls. Although various software frameworks for virtual reality periphery [e. g. 26, 311 and tangible interaction exist [cf. 7, 18, 221, a novel framework {{which provides a}} high-level TUI-object-centric interface (instead of device-centric interface) and duplex access to important physical properties of TUI-objects, e. g. three-dimensional position, sensor states, force actuators could foster the development of such mixed-reality applications. This paper describes a TUI-VR-framework whose aim is to support the development of physically enriched VR-applications. It focuses on the spatial and manipulative properties of TUI-objects, leaving it to the application to implement interaction techniques, semantics and expressive physical/digital couplings [cf. 10, 27]. On the programming side, the primary goals of the framework are the integration of a device abstraction layer, a lightweight application programming interface and full duplex communication between the TUI-application and interaction devices. The framework allows for a distributed system configuration and is highly customizable. Various virtual reality tracking frameworks and devices (e. g. VRPN, Ascension Motion Star, force-feedback devices) and physical toolkits (e. g. Phidgets) are already <b>integrated.</b> Further <b>adapters</b> can also easily be integrated. The capabilities and flexibility of the framework are illustrated {{at the end of}} the paper by means of two use cases...|$|R
5000|$|Low-end: (90/30, 90/25, 90/40): Separately {{from the}} {{high-end}} series, Sperry Univac introduced the Univac 90/30 in about 1975 {{to provide an}} upgrade path for 9x00 users and to compete with IBM's System 3. It used a disk operating system and had either a 300 or 600 lines per minute printer, a card reader, optionally a card punch, a console (Uniscope 100), attached disk drives that had removable disk packs, several 1600 or 6250 BpI tape drives, and an optional communications controller supporting up to 16 terminals (later 32) The standard disk drive was the 8416 which held a multi-layer platter removable disk pack that held approximately 29 million bytes. The 8418 drive was an enhanced version that supported both 29MB and [...] "double-density" [...] 58MB disk packs. These disk drives operated on the IDA (<b>Integrated</b> Disk <b>Adapter).</b> There was also an optional 8430 drive with a 100MB capacity that operated on a separate high speed selector channel. Available tape drives were the Uniservo 10 (Mux Channel) and Uniservo 14 (Selector channel). The optional Selector Channel also enabled the use of other high speed devices such as the 1200 lpm 0776 printer or the 2000 lpm 0770 printer. The machine had either 4K or 16K memory chips, and typical machines had between 128 to 512 KiB memory. It ran an OS called OS/3, and could run up to 7 jobs at one time, not counting various OS extensions such as the print spooler and telecommunications access (ICAM). It was an upgrade path for users who had outgrown the IBM System/3. It ran Cobol-74, RPG2, Fortran, and Assembler. The instruction set of the 90/xx series was implemented in microcode and was loaded into control storage {{as part of the}} boot up process, before loading the operating system.|$|R
40|$|Hammering drills are {{effective}} in fracturing the drilled medium while rotary drills remove cuttings. The combination provides a highly effective penetration mechanism. Piezoelectric actuators were <b>integrated</b> into an <b>adapter</b> to produce ultrasonic percussion; augmenting rotary drilling. The drill is capable of operating at low power, low applied force and, with proper tuning, low noise. These characteristics are of great interest for future NASA missions and the construction/remodeling industry. The developed augmenter connects a commercially available drill and bit and was tested to demonstrate its capability. Input power to the drill was read using a multimeter and the augmenter received a separate input voltage. The drive frequency of the piezoelectric actuator was controlled by a hill climb algorithm that optimizes and records average power usage to operate the drill at resonating frequency. Testing the rotary drill and augmenter {{across a range of}} combinations with total power constant at 160 Watts has shown results in concrete and limestone samples that are as good as or better than the commercial drill. The drill rate was increased 1. 5 to over 10 times when compared to rotation alone...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} design is to avoid the isolated information island in an industrial system, and allow devices with different types of communication protocol to form one industrial network. It has realized by hardware and software. On the hardware side, the device is composed of MCU, power supply module, two rs 232 communication modules, one rs 485 communication module, two ethernet communication modules and the watchdog. On the software side, the <b>adapter</b> <b>integrates</b> the protocols of Modbus TCP, Modbus RTU, rs 232 transparent transmission, rs 485 transparent transmission, TCP server transparent transmission, TCP client transparent transmission and UDP transparent transmission. Because the device has realized the calibration algorithm, it can control rs 232 -HART protocol converter to achieve interconnection of the HART equipment. One of the rs 232 port is used to interconnection of a wireless communication module. The wireless communication module is designed by ourselves, the wireless modules can automatically form a network {{of each other and}} communication with the host.

40|$|Solid State Disks (SSDs) {{based on}} flash and other {{non-volatile}} memory technologies reduce storage latencies from 10 s of milliseconds to 10 s or 100 s of microseconds, transforming previously inconsequential storage overheads into performance bottlenecks. This problem is especially acute in {{storage area network}} (SAN) environments where complex hardware and software layers (distributed file systems, block severs, network stacks, etc.) lie between applications and remote data. These layers can add hundreds of microseconds to requests, obscuring the performance of both flash memory and faster, emerging non-volatile memory technologies. We describe QuickSAN, a SAN prototype that eliminates most software overheads and significantly reduces hardware overheads in SANs. QuickSAN <b>integrates</b> a network <b>adapter</b> into SSDs, so the SSDs can communicate directly with one another to service storage accesses as quickly as possible. QuickSAN can also give applications direct access to both local and remote data without operating system intervention, further reducing software costs. Our evaluation of QuickSAN demonstrates remote access latencies of 20 Âµs for 4 KB requests, bandwidth improvements {{of as much as}} 163 Ã for small accesses compared with an equivalent iSCSI implementation, and 2. 3 - 3. 0 Ã application level speedup for distributed sorting. We also show that QuickSAN improves energy efficiency by up to 96 % and that QuickSANâs networking connectivity allows for improved cluster-level energy efficiency under varying load. 1...|$|R
