40|$|As {{a result}} of the earthquake, and the {{following}} tsunami and nuclear accidents, Japan was severely damaged socially and economically. It has been reported that 15, 742 people died and 7, 472 are still missing 1. More than 100, 000 buildings were <b>fully</b> destroyed, <b>burnt,</b> or washed away. There remain more than 100, 000 evacuees 2. A number of factories were physically destroyed by the earthquake, washed away by the tsunami, or damaged by flood or aftershocks. Many companies collapsed due to the disruption of their activities and/or to shrinking demand. Moreover, disruption from the earthquake in some crucial companies caused serious damage to production networks on a global scale, especially in the automotive and electronics industries. In the short term huge efforts are required for recovery. The government has started implementing its first supplementary budget of $ 49 billion, and a second supplementary budget of about a half of this size is under preparation as of the beginning of July. The Fukushima nuclear plant, however, is not yet completely under control. Trunk transport lines have quickly been repaired; the damaged section of the Tohoku Expressway was re-opened on March 24, and service on the Tohoku Shinkansen high speed rail line between Tokyo and Shin-Aomori resumed on April 293...|$|R
50|$|The {{materials}} for treatment—crushed and roasted ore, or tailings, {{as the case}} may be—are put into the hopper above the revolving barrel, or chlorinator. This latter is made of iron, lined with wood and lead, and sufficiently strong to bear a pressure of 100 lb. to the square inch, its capacity being about 30 cwt. of ore. The charge falls from the hopper into the chlorinator. Water and chlorine-producing chemicals are added—generally sulphuric acid and chloride of lime—the manhole cover is replaced and screwed down so as to be gas tight. On {{the opposite side of the}} barrel there is a valve connected with an air pump, through which air to about the pressure of four atmospheres is pumped in, to liquefy the chlorine gas that is generated, after which the valve is screwed down. The barrel is then set revolving at about ten revolutions a minute, the power being transmitted by a friction wheel. According to the nature of the ore, or the size of the grains of gold, this movement is continued from one to four hours, during which time the gold, from combination with the chlorine gas, has formed a soluble gold chloride, which has all been taken up by the water in the barrel. The chlorinator is then stopped, and the gas and compressed air allowed to escape from the valve through a rubber hose into a vat of lime water. This is to prevent the inhalation of any chlorine gas by the workmen. The manhole cover is now removed and the barrel again set revolving, by which means the contents are thrown automatically into the filter below. This filter is an iron vat lined with lead. It has a false bottom, to which is connected a pipe from a vacuum pump working intermittently. As soon as all the ore has fallen from the chlorinator into the filter, the pump is set going, a partial vacuum is produced in the chamber below the false bottom in the filter, and very rapid filtration results. By this means all the gold chlorides contained in the wet ore may be washed out, a continual stream being passed through it while filtration is going on. The solution running from the filter is continually tested, and when found free from gold, the stream of water is stopped, as is also the vacuum pump. The filter is then tipped up into a truck below, and the tailings run out to the waste heap. The process of washing and filtration occupies about an hour, during which time another charge may be in process of treatment in the chlorinator above. The discharge from the filter and the washings are run into a vat, and from this they are allowed to pass slowly through a tap into a charcoal filter. During the passage of the liquid through the charcoal filter, the chloride of gold is decomposed and the gold is deposited on the charcoal, which, when <b>fully</b> charged, is <b>burnt,</b> the ashes are fused with borax in a crucible, and the gold is obtained.|$|R

50|$|The Class 26, {{popularly known}} as the Red Devil, was rebuilt from Henschel-built Class 25NC no. 3450 by {{mechanical}} engineer David Wardale. The rebuilding {{took place at the}} Salt River shops of the SAR in Cape Town and was based on the principles developed by Argentinian mechanical engineer Livio Dante Porta. The primary objectives of the modifications were to improve the combustion and steaming rate to reduce the emission of wasteful black smoke and to overcome the problem of clinkering. This was achieved by the use of a Gas Producer Combustion System (GPCS), which relies on the gasification of coal on a low temperature firebed so that the gases are then <b>fully</b> <b>burnt</b> above the firebed.

50|$|Timing advance is {{required}} {{because it takes}} time to burn the air-fuel mixture. Igniting the mixture before the piston reaches TDC will allow the mixture to fully burn soon after the piston reaches TDC. If the air-fuel mixture is ignited at the correct time, maximum pressure in the cylinder will occur sometime after the piston reaches TDC allowing the ignited mixture to push the piston down the cylinder with the greatest force. Ideally, the time at which the mixture should be <b>fully</b> <b>burnt</b> is about 20 degrees ATDC. This will maximize the engine's power producing potential. If the ignition spark occurs at a position that is too advanced relative to piston position, the rapidly expanding air-fuel mixture can actually push against the piston still moving up, causing knocking (pinging) and possible engine damage. If the spark occurs too retarded relative to the piston position, maximum cylinder pressure will occur after the piston is already traveling too far down the cylinder. This results in lost power, overheating tendencies, high emissions, and unburned fuel.|$|E
40|$|Davidian, Thomas Guilhaume, Nolven Provendier, Helene Mirodatos, ClaudeIn this study, the {{mechanism}} of sequential cracking of acetic acid (AA) over Ni-based catalysts was investigated. During AA cracking, both thermal and catalytic reactions take place. Acetic acid is thermally decomposed into CH 4, CO, CO 2 and H- 2, which further react on Ni through WGS and steam reforming reactions, whereas some coke accumulates on the catalyst. The statistical distribution of labelled C*O- 2 species suggests fast isotopic exchange between CO 2 and surface carbonates. During the regeneration, the coke deposited during cracking is <b>fully</b> <b>burnt,</b> and carbonates are thermally decomposed. O- 18 (2) isotopic labelling experiments coupled with physico-chemical characterisations of catalysts, after cracking and regeneration steps, reveal that the nickel is reduced by cracking products {{at the beginning of}} each cracking step, and oxidized during the regeneration. This redox cycling progressively extracts metallic Ni, initially present as Ni 2 + species incorporated in spinel-type structures. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The high {{temperature}} air combustion performance {{of natural gas}} in an industrial furnace with a swirling burner was numerically modeled. A Beta function PDF (Probability Density Function) combustion model was selected to simulate the gas combustion combined with the Reynolds Stress Model (RSM) to simulate the turbulent flow. The radiation was simulated by a Discrete Ordinates method. The NO chemistry was simulated by thermal NO model. The simulation was performed at inlet air oxygen fraction 8 % and the total air excess ratio 1. 1 for natural gas. The effect of preheated air temperature on NO emission, temperature, O 2 and CO distribution in the furnace was investigated. Results showed that thermal NO emission increased when the preheated air temperature increased from 1073 K to 1473 K. When the preheated air temperature increased, both of the maximum and averaged temperature in the furnace increased. The oxygen was consumed by the formation of thermal NO at higher inlet air temperature and the fuel was not <b>fully</b> <b>burnt</b> out...|$|E

40|$|This is a time-resolved {{study of}} {{particles}} emitted during combustion of wood pellets {{with respect to}} size and composition. Two different experiments were carried out in a heated quartz glass reactor. First, real-time measurements were performed of particles, particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pPAH), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2), and oxygen (O 2). The concentration of particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons {{was used as a}} soot indicator. Then, emission of inorganic particles was studied by calculating the change in release rate from the mass change with time for ash and metals, obtained from chemical analyses of partially burnt pellets. Particles were measured by an Electrical Low-Pressure Impactor, simultaneously with pPAH, using a Photoelectric Aerosol Sensor. To obtain time-resolved information about the metals released, 250 – 290 single pellets were burnt for various periods of time and subsequently analysed. The combustion was quenched after devolatilisation and after 25, 50, and 75 % of the char conversion (mass-basis). The original pellets and partially burnt pellets were chemically analysed for carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, ash and six of the most abundant metals in the fuel. Analyses of metal content were carried out for Calcium (Ca), Potassium (K), Manganese (Mn), Magnesium (Mg), Zinc (Zn), and Sodium (Na) with an ICP-OES. <b>Fully</b> <b>burnt</b> pellets were analysed for metal composition. The results indicate that soot is mostly emitted during devolatilisation. The particles emitted during char combustion are inorganic, containing calcium, potassium, manganese, and magnesium. The release of sodium was equally distributed between devolatilisation and char combustion. The zinc release took place mainly during devolatilisation. Although the main part of calcium was released during char combustion, the mass of calcium released during devolatilisation was relatively high, corresponding to about 30 % of the ash released during this period and the concentration of calcium was 10 times or higher than those of the remaining metals studied...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Power plants spend nearly 50 billion dollars a year on fuel cost. Presently coal accounts for over 75 % of the electricity generated in this country. Due to increasingly harsh environmental regulations, the demand for low sulfur (S) coal has dramatically increased. This increase in demand is expected to cause the price of coal to rise. Such a senario has caused the utilities to explore the possibilities of supplementing coal with fuel alternatives such as the byproducts of process industries. The supplemental fuel for utilities located near feedlots (e. g. Northwest Texas) happens to be feedlot manure. Feedlot manure is attractive because it is nearly ten times cheaper than coal and is relatively inexpensive to transport. There exists nearly six million head of cattle in Northwest Texas which produce 25, 000 tons of manure each day. Feedlot manure presents water and air pollution concerns if not disposed of properly. As such, the feedlot operators are eager to find methods of safely disposing of the feedlot manure. A small scale boiler burner facility has been constructed to simulate a utility class boiler. Experiments were conducted with coal only and then for coal/feedlot manure. Three types of feedlot manure are examined; raw feedlot manure, partially composted feedlot manure, and finished composted feedlot manure. Performance characteristics and emission data were taken for each case. A summary of the results is as follows: (I) sulfur Wyoming coal was fired and a gasification efficiency of 66 % was measured. (i I) Emissions measurements were recorded and it was seen that emissions of NO,, and S 02 increased as the burnt mass fraction increased. However, all emissions were within NSPS guidelines. (iii) The successful firing of coal and feedlot manure was achieved, a gasification efficiency in the range of 86 % was measured, which is higher than 66 % obtained when firing coal alone. (iv) When the fuel blend is <b>fully</b> <b>burnt,</b> the NO,, emissions with the blend firing was lower than the firing of coal alone...|$|E
40|$|A car {{in an open}} {{car park}} is on fire. The fire and the smoke unleash a heat that causes the {{temperature}} to rise. The open car park {{is made out of}} a steel frame and to be designed for a fire resistance of 60 minutes. This car fire is a local fire whereas flashover doesn’t occur. The crucial point of the fire is when the steel frame reaches the critical temperature. If this occurs, the steel will fail and might lead to the collapse of the building. Because it is an open car park, it is assumed the natural ventilation will lead the smoke out of the building very fast. But the smoke can be trapped between the beams, which are present below the ceiling as a support structure for the floor system. The aim is to study whether the influence of trapped smoke between beams in an open car park is significant or not. And is it necessary to take the smoke into account during the design of an open car park when making use of the Bouwen met Staal guideline (BmS- guide), a guideline for the design of the fire safety of an open car park? In this study the influence of the smoke on the steel structure of the open car park was investigated by making use of a spreadsheet Car Park Fire (CaPaFi) and the software, Fire Dynamic Simulator (FDS). CaPaFi is a spreadsheet which calculates the steel temperatures without taking smoke into account. It is based on real car fire tests and the Eurocode. FDS is a program that uses computational fluid dynamic calculations to run a simulation (model) of a car fire in an open car park. It calculates the steel temperature of the steel beams taking the effect of smoke into account. All the information for FDS is written in a script beforehand and run afterwards. A single car fire and a 3 car fire were modeled and studied. To verify the calculations in FDS with CaPaFi, a single car fire model was put up. Because there were still some differences in the results, 4 more models were set up with small adjustments in the first one to fine tune the model (model 2 to 5). According to the study 95 % of the car fires are limited to maximum 3 (<b>fully)</b> <b>burnt</b> cars. So, 3 car fires were also taken into account and the smoke. There were two cases with 3 car fires: one with beam sticking out (model 6 with obstacles) and one with beams hidden in the ceiling (model 7 without obstacles). Based on the results of this study, it is found that the smoke which is trapped between the beams can be neglected when making use of the BmS-guide to design the fire safety of an open car park for the steel beams with a height smaller than 500 mm. Also a reasonable explanation could not be found of why the temperatures of the steel beams of FDS are lower than the ones calculated by CaPaFi. And in a 3 car fire model points that are further away from the car fire can be disregarded because their steel temperature calculated by FDS, even though higher than CaPaFi, will never reach the critical temperature. At last, it is still unclear why the increased number of soot doesn’t have any effect on the temperature of the steel beams in the single car fire model.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) A {{theoretical}} and experimental study was undertaken on the radiative properties of solids suspended in furnace gases {{and those of}} the solid deposits formed on the furnace wall during pulverised coal combustion. Experiments included measurement of the absorption indices of coal, char, ash and slag particles, and the emittance of their deposits, both real time and ex-situ, to assess the effects of particle size, physical state, iron and unburnt carbon (UC), devolatilisation and heating. Theoretical studies included formulation of mathematical models for spectral radiative heat transfer involving particulates and gases, and for the spectral emittance of opaque and semi-transparent ash deposits. These codes considered both isothermal and non-isothermal fields, particle size, composition and concentration variables and evaluation of the effect of UC on radiative heat transfer and emittance of ash clouds. A technique was proposed to measure the absorption index of the particulate samples. The technique, after calibration with known samples, was applied to three different coal samples, char prepared from each of these at several burnout levels, and <b>fully</b> <b>burnt</b> ash from each of these. In ash samples, the level of UC has a significant effect on the absorption index. Using these data the evolution of total emissivity of single coal particles with burnout was examined. A marked increase in emissivity was predicted during the initial stages of burnout followed by a decrease during the later stages. The effect of UC on net heat transfer across a plane parallel slab of particles was examined. Rapid decrease was observed up tp 10 % UC content, after which the rate of decrease was predicted to decrease. The effect of UC distribution in ash was examined qualitatively by calculating the hemispherical emittance of a slab of flyash particulates considering two cases: all particles have the same UC content, or the UC content was concentrated only in the large particles. The significant difference in emittance between the two cases suggest that it is not sufficient to specify only the bulk UC content of the flyash, rather how the UC is distributed relative to the particle size. A model was developed to predict the spectral normal and hemispherical emittance of opaque and semi-transparent particulate deposits. A significant effect of particle size and composition on spectral emittance of particulate deposits was predicted. The presence of large particles and particles having high iron content were found to make deposits more emissive at wavelengths up to 5 μm. Calculations indicated that the apparent emittance if there is a substantial temperature gradient across it and the material is weakly absorbing. Results of calculations performed for two types of deposits (one heated from bottom and the other heated from top), indicated that care must be taken in experimental design and data interpretation for accurate prediction of emittance from such measurements. The approximate thickness required for opacity (1 % transmission of ash deposits was calculated using the model developed and found to vary between 80 μm and 1 mm {{depending on the type of}} material and particle size in the deposit, consistent with measurements reported in literature. The emittance of smooth slag layers was predicted to be of grey character, insensitive to both the real and the absorption index and exceed 0. 9, a value supported by recent published measurements. Speculations on the variation in the deposit properties as they build are presented with results of preliminary experiments to examine these speculations. Calculations were performed to assess the effects of conductive and radiative properties on exit gas temperature, wall flux and efficiency of a power station furnace. For a moderately reflective layer, both these effects are found to be significant whereas for unreflective deposits, conductive effects are found to be more significant. Comparison with an industrial measurement supported the predicted effects. Spectral emittance measurements using slag particles showed the effect of particle size being limited primarily to the wavelengths below 6 μm, supporting model predictions. Heating of the particles at temperatures above 1000 °C resulted in higher emittance values. At a particular temperature, emittance measured during the cooling cycle was found to be higher than the emittance measured during the heating cycle indicating possible irreversible structural transformations. Spectral emittance measured on slag particles having difference iron contents indicated the effect to be limited to wavelengths below 5 μm with particles having higher iron content recording higher emittance. Spectral emittance measured on particles of muffle burnt ash and the particles of the same ash after melting to a slag showed differences with the slagged ash recording significantly higher emittance. The effect of devolatilisation on emittance increases to about 0. 85 before decreasing to values about 0. 7 with char combustion. Spectral emittance of char samples was measured as a function of ash content with char having lower ash content recording higher emittance. Few studies have reported the importance of the inclusion of dependent effects in radiation calculations on the emittance of ash deposits. All studies are limited to either very small particles or very large particles and the experiments are either transmission or reflection measurements. Measurements were conducted using particle sizes relevant to radiative heat transfer in furnaces, and also involving two independent sets of measurements, transmission and reflection, on the same sample. Measured emittances were significantly higher than the values predicted assuming independent effects only thus showing the importance of dependent effects. Additional experiments using a wider range of samples and particle sizes are recommended to quantify the extent of dependent effects. The study provides the {{theoretical and}} experimental confirmation of the difference in nature between the spectral emittance of particulate and slagged deposits and thus show the importance of the physical state on emittance of deposits rather than the chemical composition. The results provide the necessary background for deposit monitoring using pyrometric measurements with consequent effects on the calculation of devolatilisation rates and heat transfer as well as the inclusion of this spectral character in radiative transfer. All the effects (size, dependent, thermal, physical state etc.) on emittance of particulate deposits are found to be limited primarily to the wavelength region below 6 μm...|$|E
