In other words, U {{can be used as}} a figure of merit to compare any two-port active device (which includes three-terminal devices used as two-ports). For example, a factory producing BJTs can calculate U of the transistors it is producing and compare their quality to the other BJTs on the market. Furthermore, U {{can be used as a}}n <b>indicator</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity.</b> If U is greater than one, the two-port device is active; otherwise, that device is passive. This is especially useful in the microwave engineering community. Though originally published in a circuit theory journal, Masons paper becomes especially relevant to microwave engineers since U is usually slightly greater than or equal to one in the microwave frequency range. When U is smaller than or considerably larger than one, it becomes relatively useless.|$|E

The most important question to be answered is how to utilize the Rhodococcus desulfurization complex in a nonaqueous solvent or medium, such as the oil itself. Successful application of nonaqueous enzymology to this problem will involve finding ways to stabilize the active conformations of the enzymes and provide for easy recovery of the enzymes, perhaps in an immobilized-enzyme packed-bed reactor. A second objective is to explore biological systems that can catalyze the cleavage or organometallics in fossil fuels, such as metal porphyrins. A biodemetallation function could greatly aid in the refining of high-metal, high-sulfur crudes and bitumens. During this period, work was initiated to develop new rapid and highly quantitative assays for specific desulfurization activities in isolated and separated enzyme fractions.

Methods to optically detect pH changes which are a general <b>indicator</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> in extracellular space are also briefly reviewed. Performance metrics such as sensitivity, sensor size, drift, time response, and sensing range are included when available. Highly suitable optical sensor technologies for moni-toring cellular metabolic activity include luminescent (fluorescent, phosphorescent, and chemiluminescent) and colorimetric optical probes. Different approaches to extracting luminescent and colori-metric information are reviewed, including benchtop techniques, fiber-optic approaches, and the use of probes encapsulated by biologically localized embedding.

40|$|A new {{generation}} of dedicated Doppler spectrographs will attempt to detect low-mass exoplanets around mid-late M stars at near infrared (NIR) wavelengths, where those stars are brightest and have the most Doppler information content. A central requirement {{for the success of}} these instruments is to properly measure the component of radial velocity (RV) variability contributed by stellar magnetic activity and to account for it in exoplanet models of RV data. The wavelength coverage for many of these new instruments will not include the Ca II H&K or H-alpha lines, the most frequently used absorption-line tracers of magnetic activity. Thus, it is necessary to define and characterize NIR activity indicators for mid-late M stars in order to provide simultaneous activity metrics for NIR RV data. We have used the high-cadence UVES observations of the M 5. 5 dwarf Proxima Centauri from Fuhrmeister et al. (2011) to compare the activity sensitivity of 8 NIR atomic lines to that of H-alpha.

Participants wore an activity monitor, which reported posture continuously for a week. The number of STS movements was the primary outcome measure, and mean values of daily STS frequency were reported. The pattern of activity was investigated using median values of STS hourly rate.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine whether COMP is released from skin to serum in SSc patients, and may serve as <b>indicator</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> of skin involvement. METHODS: Serum COMP levels were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay in patients with SSc whose skin involvement was assessed with the modified Rodnan skin score (mRss) and high frequency ultrasound. The presence of COMP in skin biopsies was assessed by Western blot using a monoclonal antibody to the very C-terminal end of human COMP. RESULTS: Serum COMP correlated to skin involvement as measured by the mRss (n= 70; rS= 0. 60; p< 0. 001), to skin thickness measured by ultrasound (n= 88; rS= 0. 55; p< 0. 001) and inversely to skin echogenicity measured by ultrasound (n= 88; rS=- 0. 40; p< 0. 001). In 70 patients followed longitudinally there was a correlation between changes in serum COMP (n= 307) and changes in mRss (rS= 0. 35; p= 0. 008). In individual patients monitored with repeated measurements, serum COMP changes closely paralleled changes in mRss. A C-terminal COMP fragment, with an apparent Mr 56 kDa, was identified in SSc skin biopsies, while no COMP-reactivity was detected in normal skin.

We have used the Preliminary ELAIS Catalogue for the 6. 7 -Î¼m (LW 2) and 15 -Î¼m (LW 3) fluxes. All of the high-reliability LW 2 sources and 80 per cent of the LW 3 sources are identified in the near-IR survey reaching K~ 17. 5 mag. The near-IR/mid-IR flux ratios can effectively be used to separate stars from galaxies in mid-IR surveys. The stars detected in our survey region are used to derive a new accurate calibration for the ELAIS ISOCAM data in both the LW 2 and LW 3 filters. We show that near- to mid-IR colour-colour diagrams can be used to classify galaxies further, as well as to study star formation. The ELAIS ISOCAM survey is found mostly to detect strongly star-forming late-type galaxies, possibly starburst-powered galaxies, and it also picks out obscured active galactic nuclei. The ELAIS galaxies yield an average mid-IR flux ratio LW 2 /LW 3 = 0. 67 +/- 0. 27.

40|$|We {{present the}} results of a spectroscopic survey to {{characterize}} chromospheric activity, as measured by Hα emission, in low-mass members of the 500 -Myr-old open cluster M 37. Combining our new measurements of Hα luminosities (L_Hα) with previously cataloged stellar properties, we identify saturated and unsaturated regimes in the dependence of the L_Hα-to-bolometric-luminosity ratio, L_Hα/L_bol, on the Rossby number R_o. All rotators with Ro smaller than 0. 03 ± 0. 01 converge to an activity level of L_Hα/L_bol = (1. 27 ± 0. 02) x 10 ^- 4. This saturation threshold (R_o,sat = 0. 03 ± 0. 01) is statistically smaller than that found in most studies of the rotation-activity relation. In the unsaturated regime, slower rotators have lower levels of chromospheric activity, with L_Hα/L_bol(R_o) following a power-law of index β = - 0. 51 ± 0. 02, slightly shallower than the one found for a combined ≈ 650 -Myr-old sample of Hyades and Praesepe stars. By comparing this unsaturated behavior to that previously found for coronal activity in M 37 (as measured via the X-ray luminosity, L_X), we confirm that chromospheric activity decays at a much slower rate than coronal activity with increasing R_o. While a comparison of L_Hα and L_X for M 37 members with measurements of both reveals a nearly 1 : 1 relation, removing the mass-dependencies by comparing instead L_Hα/L_bol and L_X/L_bol does not provide clear evidence for such a relation. Finally, we find that R_o,sat is smaller for our chromospheric than for our coronal <b>indicator</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> (R_o,sat = 0. 03 ± 0. 01 versus 0. 09 ± 0. 01).

Although initially believed to be pathological, subsequent discoveries of Neanderthal remains made femoral curvature {{as well as the}} lateral curvature of the radius to be considered derived Neanderthal features. Femoral curvature has previously been used in racial identification in modern humans but its functional significance is poorly understood. A recent study on Neanderthals and early modern humans found no differences in femoral curvature but did not consider size-corrected curvature. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to 1) use 3 D morphometric landmark and semi- landmark analysis to quantify bone curvature (femur, ulna, radius) in Neanderthals, Upper Palaeolithic and recent modern humans, 2) compare adult bone curvature between these populations, and 3) test hypotheses on the effects of climate, body size, and activity patterns on curvature. Comparisons between and within populations were made using geometric morphometrics (3 D landmarks) and standard multivariate methods. Comparative material involved all available Neanderthal and Upper Palaeolithic modem human femora, ulnae and radii, archaeological (Mesolithic, Neolithic, Medieval) and recent human populations representing a wide geographical and lifestyle range. The study found that there are significant differences in the anatomy of the femur, ulna and radius between Neanderthals and modern humans. Neanderthals have more curved femora and radii than modern humans. Early modern humans are most similar to recent modern humans in their anatomy. Recent modern human analyses indicate that femoral curvature and lower arm curvature are responses to disparate influences.
