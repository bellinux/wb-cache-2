5|$|The {{game has}} been mostly {{positively}} received by critics, who <b>have</b> <b>appreciated</b> its premise, writing, characters and presentation. The game {{has been a}} commercial success both in Japan and internationally, with the North American release selling higher than expectations and being hard to find in stores shortly after release. Other media based on the game has been made: a manga series premiered in 2006; a film adaptation of the game, titled Ace Attorney, premiered in 2012; and an anime series adaptation started airing in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Both {{dates of}} the Pilgrim half dollar <b>have</b> <b>appreciated</b> in price over the years, with the rarer 1921 leading the way, of which only 20,000 are extant. At {{the peak of}} the first {{commemorative}} coin boom in 1936, the 1920 sold for $1.75 and the 1921 for $8; at {{the peak of the}} second boom in 1980 the 1920 sold for $275 and the 1921 for $800.

An exceptional specimen of the 1920 sold at auction in 2014 for $7,344.|$|E

It was very bumpy, as you can appreciate, as we should <b>have</b> <b>appreciated,</b> up against those mountains in January, and the refueling plane and the Question Mark were torn apart. I was piloting the Question Mark and I realized that General Spaatz had probably been drenched in high octane gasoline.|$|E

500|$|In stark {{contrast}} to the Werehog sections, many reviewers found the daytime levels to be enjoyable, especially the [...] "exhilarating" [...] sense of speed they provide; with [...] "the most satisfying gameplay of any Sonic title in years", the game [...] "perfectly [...] the feel of classic Sonic". Many also enjoyed the mixture of, and transition between, 2D and 3D sections. Indeed, many reviewers remarked that they would <b>have</b> <b>appreciated</b> the game more had it consisted solely of, and expanded upon, the daytime levels. GameSpot's review for the Xbox 360 version, however, argued that the controls were [...] "unresponsive" [...] in the daytime levels, and that most of them were [...] "horribly designed", instead describing the Wii version as a [...] "vastly superior experience", with its daytime levels praised for better control and design.|$|E
500|$|With {{the onset}} of the Great Depression in 1929, the Experimental College began a slow decline. Many {{students}} couldn't afford tuition, fewer had additional savings, and several dropped out. Along with books and campus salaries, the Experimental College became a budgetary luxury during a time of economic need for both students and the state, and its funding was in jeopardy. Meiklejohn started an Experimental College interest-fee loan fund for unfunded students, and asked advisers and monied students to donate. During this period, some sophomores absconded the college for two weeks to live like the vagrant hobos who traveled the Midwest by rail looking for work. They returned to write papers about their experiences, which Meiklejohn is said to <b>have</b> <b>appreciated</b> for its syncretism of experience and the great questions grounded in their readings.|$|E

500|$|Geoff Thew at Hardcore Gamer {{said that}} the [...] "craziness" [...] of the game world makes the cases entertaining, but also that it [...] "resonates on a deeper level" [...] due to its {{connection}} to the real Japanese legal system, making the setting still feel relevant in 2014. Bob Mackey at USgamer {{said that the}} Ace Attorney games were among the best written games of all time, and that the series' strength is how each game builds up to a [...] "stunning and satisfying finale". Thomas Whitehead at Nintendo Life also liked the writing, praising its balance between [...] "light-hearted nonsense" [...] and darker, more serious scenarios. Several reviewers <b>have</b> <b>appreciated</b> the series' characters; Thew said that Phoenix and Maya's banter is {{among the best in}} video games, and that Edgeworth's character arc {{is one of the most}} compelling parts of the stories.|$|E
500|$|Goldfaden {{was born}} in Starokonstantinov (Russia; present day Ukraine). His birthdate is {{sometimes}} given as July 12, following the [...] "Old Style" [...] calendar in use {{at that time in}} the Russian Empire. He attended a Jewish religious school (a cheder), but his middle-class family was strongly associated with the Haskalah, or Jewish Enlightenment, and his father, a watchmaker, arranged that he receive private lessons in German and Russian. As a child, he is said to <b>have</b> <b>appreciated</b> and imitated the performances of wedding jesters and Brody singers to the degree that he acquired the nickname Avromele Badkhen, [...] "Abie the Jester." [...] In 1857 he began studies at the government-run rabbinical school at Zhytomyr, from which he emerged in 1866 as a teacher and a poet (with some experience in amateur theater), but he never led a congregation.|$|E
500|$|Despite Hasbro's target {{demographic}} {{of young}} girls and their parents, My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic has become a cultural and Internet phenomenon, with many male fans between 13 and 35. The response from the Internet has been traced to cartoon and animation fans on the Internet board 4chan, responding to Amidi's negative essay regarding the show and current trends in animation. As {{a result of the}} discussion on 4chan, interest in the show spread throughout other parts of the Internet, creating a large fanbase and a multitude of creative works, fan sites, and conventions. The fanbase has adopted the name [...] "brony" [...] (a portmanteau of [...] "bro" [...] and [...] "pony") to describe themselves. The older fanbase had {{come as a surprise to}} Hasbro and staff members involved with the show. They <b>have</b> <b>appreciated</b> and embraced the fandom, adding nods to the fans within the show and the toys, while, early on, allowing the creative elements of the fandom to flourish without legal interference.|$|E

500|$|A private {{memorial}} service for Chapman was held at St Bartholomew's on 3 December, two months after his death. The service began with a chorus of the hymn [...] "Jerusalem" [...] sung in Engrish with a mock Chinese accent. Cleese delivered a memorable eulogy to Chapman with a shock humour that he believed Chapman would <b>have</b> <b>appreciated,</b> and later became the first person at a televised British {{memorial service}} to say [...] "fuck". Palin also delivered a eulogy to Chapman, as did Idle, quipping that Chapman had decided to die rather than listen to Palin once again. Idle also led the other surviving Pythons and Chapman's close friends and family in a rendition of the song [...] "Always Look on the Bright Side of Life" [...] from The Life of Brian. Idle closed his remarks by saying: [...] "I'd just {{like to be the}} last person at this meeting to say 'fuck'." ...|$|E
500|$|Catherine {{was unable}} to control Henry {{in the way she}} had Francis and Charles. Her role in his {{government}} became that of chief executive and roving diplomat. She travelled widely across the kingdom, enforcing his authority and trying to head off war. In 1578, she took on the task of pacifying the south. At the age of fifty-nine, she embarked on an eighteen-month journey around the south of France to meet Huguenot leaders face to face. Her efforts won Catherine new respect from the French people. On her return to Paris in 1579, she was greeted outside the city by the Parlement and crowds. The Venetian ambassador, Gerolamo Lipomanno, wrote: [...] "She is an indefatigable princess, born to tame and govern a people as unruly as the French: they now recognize her merits, her concern for unity and are sorry not to <b>have</b> <b>appreciated</b> her sooner." [...] She was under no illusions, however. On 25 November 1579, she wrote to the king, [...] "You are {{on the eve of a}} general revolt. Anyone who tells you differently is a liar." ...|$|E
500|$|International {{productions}} {{have opened}} to similarly ambivalent critical reception. The West End production opened to {{a slightly more}} upbeat response. The majority of critics <b>have</b> <b>appreciated</b> the spectacle of the lavish production, and the [...] "powerhouse" [...] performances of actors in {{the roles of the}} two witches. However, contemporaries have characterized the production as overblown, occasionally preachy, and suffering from more hype than heart. Although Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph described it as [...] "at times ... a bit of a mess," [...] he praised Holzman's script, described Kenneth Posner's lighting design as [...] "magical" [...] and lauded Menzel's Elphaba and Helen Dallimore's Glinda. Michael Billington of The Guardian gave it three out of five stars and remarked on the competence of all the lead actors; however, he complained that Wicked was [...] "all too typical of the modern Broadway musical: efficient, knowing and highly professional but more like a piece of industrial product than something that genuinely touches the heart or mind". Paul Taylor of The Independent gave extremely negative remarks to his viewing of the London production, calling the attempt at topical political allegory [...] "well-meaning but also melodramatic, incoherent and dreadfully superficial" [...] while deploring the acting, songs and book, concluding that [...] "the production manages to feel at once overblown and empty." ...|$|E

500|$|Percy Olsen, {{television}} {{editor for}} Student Life, said [...] "The Coon" [...] was {{an improvement over}} [...] "The Ring" [...] because it was less heavy-handed in its morals. Olsen also said it raised the question, [...] "What ever happened to the goofy superhero movies? From Batman to the Hulk, it seems like every comic book hero movie {{has been given a}} splotch of mud and some dim lighting before being sent out the door." [...] Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+ grade, although she did not like the [...] "non-reveal" [...] ending. She also said the target material for [...] "The Coon" [...] is too easy, but she said the episode was [...] "really likable" [...] and she particularly liked Cartman's growing frustration when his superhero persona is ignored. Travis Fickett of IGN also said he did not like the ending and, although he liked Butters' part in the episode and the riffing on comic book stereotypes, Fickett felt the episode lacked any [...] "brilliant moments" [...] and [...] "ultimately runs out of steam with the super-hero riff". Mitchell Geller of The Tufts Daily said the episode would be more enjoyable to people familiar with the comic book film franchise it was spoofing than it would be for those who are not, although he said Cartman [...] "never ceases to be funny". Comic book writer and creator of Watchmen, Alan Moore, was reported to <b>have</b> <b>appreciated</b> the episode.|$|E
500|$|... "Empire State of Mind" [...] {{was first}} {{performed}} at Jay-Z's [...] "Answer the Call" [...] benefit concert in Madison Square Garden on September 11, 2009, {{where it was}} the opening song. All ticket proceeds from the show went to the New York Police and Fire Widows and Children's Fund. The song was then performed live at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards (MTV VMA) on September 13, 2009, where it closed the awards show. The VMA performance {{was the first time}} Jay-Z and Keys performed the song together. Shaheem Redi of MTV News commented on the performance that, [...] "Their set was elegant and 'hood at the same time, and it was such a powerful moment". Ryan Brockington of the New York Post wrote [...] "Alicia's buttery voice and Jay-Z's impeccable stage presence made for an audio adrenaline overload" [...] and placed the performance third on his list of the [...] "top six performances" [...] from the MTV VMAs. For the performance Jay-Z wore his signature Yankees cap and Keys wore all black while playing the piano. During the MTV VMA performance images of locations in New York, such as the Empire State Building and the Apollo Theatre, were shown on an overhead screen behind Jay-Z and Keys. Towards the end of the performance rapper Lil' Mama got up onto the stage uninvited and posed with Jay-Z and Keys while they were finishing the final verse of the track. Lil' Mama said she did not mean to disrespect either performer but the song had her [...] "emotions running high", adding that [...] "in that moment I came up onstage to celebrate my two icons singing about NY." [...] Keys responded to the incident saying [...] "We can appreciate her being overwhelmed and inspired, but we would <b>have</b> <b>appreciated</b> it if she would have done it from her seat", and Jay-Z added, [...] "It was a lot of planning that went into that performance. To disrupt that was outta line." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly said that the duo [...] "brought some genuine street heat to the tongue-twisting torrents" [...] of [...] "Empire State of Mind". She added that [...] "Keys, on piano and soaring chorus, brought the feminine strength and soul." ...|$|E
