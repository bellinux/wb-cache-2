5|$|Also, {{differences}} in morphology and <b>development</b> <b>are</b> seen. In the desert locust and the migratory locust, for example, the gregaria nymphs become darker with strongly contrasting yellow and black markings, they grow larger, and have longer developmental periods. The adults are larger with different body proportions, less sexual dimorphism, and higher metabolic rates. They mature more rapidly and start reproducing earlier, but have {{lower levels of}} fecundity.|$|E

5|$|Like {{several other}} luxury neighbourhoods in the city, apartments in the David's Village <b>development</b> <b>are</b> mostly owned by foreigners who visit {{for only a}} few days or weeks a year. Critics contend that this makes it a ghost town in the city centre.|$|E
5|$|Many {{environmental}} {{scientists believe}} amphibians, including frogs, are good biological indicators of broader ecosystem health {{because of their}} intermediate positions in food chains, their permeable skins, and typically biphasic lives (aquatic larvae and terrestrial adults). It appears that species with both aquatic eggs and larvae are most affected by the decline, while those with direct <b>development</b> <b>are</b> the most resistant.|$|E
5|$|Modern weapons technologies, {{including}} the required research and <b>development,</b> <b>are</b> particularly capital-intensive and costly. The time between initial {{research and the}} deployment of weapon systems can be {{as long as a}} decade, during which the government must provide financial security and political justification for the project. In other words, the state not only provides the funding but also identifies a credible external enemy who warrants such expenditure.|$|E

5|$|Once {{growth and}} <b>development</b> <b>are</b> completed, {{vitamins}} remain essential nutrients for the healthy {{maintenance of the}} cells, tissues, and organs {{that make up a}} multicellular organism; they also enable a multicellular life form to efficiently use chemical energy provided by food it eats, and to help process the proteins, carbohydrates, and fats required for cellular respiration.|$|E
5|$|Using human {{manufacturing}} processes, wheeled {{systems of}} varying complexity have proven fairly simple to construct, {{and issues of}} power transmission and friction have proven tractable. It is not clear, however, that the vastly different processes of embryonic <b>development</b> <b>are</b> suited to—or even capable of—producing a functioning wheel, for reasons described below.|$|E
5|$|Another reason exports {{cannot be}} {{promoted}} is because in all likelihood, an underdeveloped country {{may only be}} skilled enough to promote the export of primary goods, say agricultural goods. However, since such commodities face inelastic demand, {{the extent to which}} they will sell in the market is limited. Although when population is at a rise, additional demand for exports may be created, Nurkse implicitly assumed that developed countries are operating at the replacement rate of population growth. For Nurkse, then, exports as a means of economic <b>development</b> <b>are</b> completely ruled out.|$|E
50|$|Natural <b>development</b> <b>is</b> {{distinct}} from <b>development</b> by government initiatives and planning. Natural <b>development</b> <b>is</b> the spontaneous and unconscious process of development that normally occurs. Planned <b>development</b> <b>is</b> {{the result of}} deliberate conscious initiatives {{by the government to}} speed development through special programs and policies. Natural <b>development</b> <b>is</b> an unconscious process, since it results from the behavior of countless individuals acting on their own—rather than conscious intention of the community. It is also unconscious in the sense that society achieves the results without being fully conscious of how it did so.|$|R

5|$|Cells {{that stop}} {{dividing}} (post-mitotic) and differentiate into neurons early in cortical <b>development</b> <b>are</b> important in {{laying the groundwork}} on which other developing neurons can be guided to their proper destination. Tbr1 aids in neuronal migration in the early development of the cerebral cortex. It is largely expressed in post-mitotic neurons of the preplate, which forms a foundation upon which neurons are able to grow and move. As a transcription factor, Tbr1 modulates the expression of RELN, which encodes the Reln protein that forms part of the extracellular matrix of cells. Thus, through regulation of Reln expression, Tbr1 regulates {{the formation of the}} matrix through which neurons migrate. Without Tbr1, neurons fail to migrate properly.|$|E
5|$|Chronic underinvestment in {{research}} since 1990 forced many scientific professionals {{to leave the}} country. As a result, Bulgaria scores low in terms of innovation, competitiveness and high-value added exports. Principal areas of research and <b>development</b> <b>are</b> energy, nanotechnology, archaeology and medicine. The Bulgarian Academy of Sciences (BAS) is the leading scientific establishment and employs most Bulgarian researchers in its numerous institutes. It {{has been active in}} the field of space science with RADOM-7 radiation monitoring experiments on the International Space Station and Chandrayaan-1, and domestically developed space greenhouses on the Mir space station. Bulgaria became the sixth country in the world to have an astronaut in space with Georgi Ivanov's flight on Soyuz 33 in 1979. Bulgaria is an active member of CERN and has contributed to its activities with nearly 200 scientists since its accession in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{regarding}} neuroprotective and specially regenerative treatments, such as {{stem cell}} therapy, while their research is considered of high importance {{at the moment}} they are only a promise of future therapeutic approaches. Likewise, there are not any effective treatments for the progressive variants of the disease. Many of the newest drugs {{as well as those}} under <b>development</b> <b>are</b> probably going to be evaluated as therapies for PPMS or SPMS, and their improved effectiveness when compared with previously existing drugs may eventually lead to a positive result in these groups of patients.|$|E

5|$|Most of Amarillo's {{population}} growth and commercial <b>development</b> <b>are</b> occurring in the southern and northwestern parts of the city. Similar to many towns in the Texas Panhandle, the city's downtown has suffered economic deterioration throughout the years. To help revitalize it, the organization Center City of Amarillo was formed to establish partnerships with groups who have a large presence in the city. Since its conception in the 1990s, Center City has sponsored public art projects and started block parties in the downtown area.|$|E
5|$|Particularly {{striking}} in his symphonic poems is Liszt's approach to musical form. As purely musical structures, {{they do not}} follow a strict presentation and development of musical themes as they would under sonata form. Instead, they follow a loose episodic pattern, in which motifsrecurring melodies associated with a subjectare thematically transformed {{in a manner similar}} to that later made famous by Richard Wagner. Recapitulations, where themes are normally restated after they are combined and contrasted in <b>development,</b> <b>are</b> foreshortened, while codas, where pieces of music generally wind to a close, are greatly enlarged to a size and scope that can affect the listener's concept of the themes. Themes shuffle into new and unexpected patterns of order, and three- or four-movement structures roll into one in a continual process of creative experimentation.|$|E
5|$|The {{species in}} all {{probability}} {{has little or no}} direct impact or influence on human interests and concerns but agricultural and real estate <b>development</b> <b>are</b> a threat to the species' very narrow habitat. Collecting specimens in the dry ridges is complicated by the millions of ants which eat the bait in the trap the moment it is set on the ground. Live collecting is the alternative, but the bait is usually digested by the time the animal is taken from the trap, making food research difficult if not impossible.|$|E

5|$|For vertebrates, {{the early}} stages of neural <b>development</b> <b>are</b> similar across all species. As the embryo {{transforms}} from a round blob of cells into a wormlike structure, a narrow strip of ectoderm running along the midline of the back is induced to become the neural plate, the precursor of the nervous system. The neural plate folds inward to form the neural groove, and then the lips that line the groove merge to enclose the neural tube, a hollow cord of cells with a fluid-filled ventricle at the center. At the front end, the ventricles and cord swell to form three vesicles that are the precursors of the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. At the next stage, the forebrain splits into two vesicles called the telencephalon (which will contain the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and related structures) and the diencephalon (which will contain the thalamus and hypothalamus). At about the same time, the hindbrain splits into the metencephalon (which will contain the cerebellum and pons) and the myelencephalon (which will contain the medulla oblongata). Each of these areas contains proliferative zones where neurons and glial cells are generated; the resulting cells then migrate, sometimes for long distances, to their final positions.|$|E
