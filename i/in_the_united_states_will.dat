25|$|It is {{estimated}} that 1 in 25,000 babies born <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>will</b> {{have some form of}} the mucopolysaccharidoses. It is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that only individuals inheriting the defective gene from both parents are affected.

When both people in a couple have the defective gene, each pregnancy carries with it a one in four chance that the child will be affected. The parents and siblings of an affected child may have no sign of the disorder. Unaffected siblings and select relatives of a child with one of the mucopolysaccharidoses may carry the recessive gene and could pass it to their own children.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Census Bureau view on {{the future}} of {{longevity}} is that life expectancy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>will</b> be in the mid-80s by 2050 (up from 77.85 in 2006) and will top out eventually in the low 90s, barring major scientific advances that can change the rate of human aging itself, as opposed to merely treating the effects of aging as is done today. The Census Bureau also predicted that the United States would have 5.3 million people aged over 100 in 2100. The United Nations has also made projections far out into the future, up to 2300, at which point it projects that life expectancies in most developed countries will be between 100 and 106 years and still rising, though more and more slowly than before. These projections also suggest that life expectancies in poor countries will still be less than those in rich countries in 2300, in some cases by as much as 20 years. The UN itself mentioned that gaps in life expectancy so far in the future may well not exist, especially since the exchange of technology between rich and poor countries and the industrialization and development of poor countries may cause their life expectancies to converge fully with those of rich countries long before that point, similarly to the way life expectancies between rich and poor countries have already been converging over the last 60 years as better medicine, technology, and living conditions became accessible to many people in poor countries. The UN has warned that these projections are uncertain, and cautions that any change or advancement in medical technology could invalidate such projections.|$|E

500|$|On 19 August 2014, Alvin Hellerstein, {{senior judge}} of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, {{concluded}} that the Spanish version of [...] "Loca" [...] had been indirectly plagiarised from [...] "Loca con su Tiguere", a mid-1990s song composed by Dominican songwriter Ramon [...] "Arias" [...] Vasquez. He testified that he had met Bello in 2006 and had introduced him to two of his songs, including [...] "Loca con su Tiguere". According to Vasquez, Bello {{was impressed by the}} song and asked him to record it. However, Bello claimed that the song was originally his and was based on his relationship with his ex-wife as opposed to Vasquez's claim that [...] "Loca con su Tiguere" [...] was based on his sister's relationship with a street-tough boyfriend. Hellerstein ruled in favour of Vasquez and found the two songs to be similar in structure and rhythm. As the Spanish version of [...] "Loca" [...] features Bello singing numerous portions, the judge reasoned that it too was plagiarised from Vasquez's song. After a trial phase, SonyATV Latin and Sony/ATV Discos (the distributors of the Spanish version of [...] "Loca" [...] <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States)</b> <b>will</b> pay damages to Mayimba Music, the owner of the rights to Vasquez's song and the plaintiff in the lawsuit.|$|E

2500|$|Owing to the {{incredible}} amount of chemical and methodological variability to be found when dealing with stained glass, research into the general production habits of pertinent regions or eras may provide clues that can help conservators understand the overall significance of the piece, anticipate {{what to expect from}} the materials, and determine how to proceed (Sloan 1993, 28; Vogel 2007, 5). [...] For example, a conservator working on a set of windows <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> <b>will</b> want to ascertain whether the glass was produced before, during, or after the mid-19th century, as changes to general glass composition were made during this time that could influence the types of impurities—and subsequently, some of the deterioration—to be expected (Vogel et al. 2007, 7).
