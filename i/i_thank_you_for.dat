The sermon caused a national controversy, as some incorrectly interpreted Lord's view as being that the government can essentially make legal any sinful action legal or mandatory, including murder and theft, among others. He was called a Judas and a Benedict Arnold, although the controversy simmered out fairly quickly as his true views became clarified. Indeed, he was eventually commended by fellow clerics, and by President Millard Fillmore, who sent him the following letter: [...] Washington, D.C., Jan. 13, 1851'Rev. J. C. Lord, [...] My Dear Sir: “The cares of state” leave me no time for general reading, and it was not till this evening, that I found leisure to peruse your admirable sermon on the “Higher Law and Fugitive Slave Bill.” I return you my thanks, most cordially and sincerely, for this admirable discourse. You have rendered the nation a great and valuable service, and I am highly gratified to learn, that thousands and tens of thousands have been reprinted in New York, and sent here, and are now being distributed under the franks of members of Congress.
