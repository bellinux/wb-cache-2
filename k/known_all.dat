5|$|Beryllium oxide, BeO, {{is a white}} {{refractory}} solid, {{which has}} the wurtzite crystal structure and a thermal conductivity as high as in some metals. BeO is amphoteric. Salts of beryllium can be produced by treating Be(OH)2 with acid. Beryllium sulfide, selenide and telluride are <b>known,</b> <b>all</b> having the zincblende structure.|$|E
5|$|McMillin {{was born}} on January 12, 1895 to Reuben Thomas McMillin and Martha Buchanan Reilly in Prairie Hill, Limestone County, Texas. The family moved in 1897 to Waco and in 1901 to Fort Worth. McMillin's father was a meat packer. As a child, Bo was known to pick fights, but was also <b>known</b> <b>all</b> his life as one who never drunk nor smoked nor swore. He spoke with a {{distinctive}} Texas drawl.|$|E
5|$|Ruth soon {{realized}} that Fuchs had deceived him, and {{had no intention of}} making him manager or giving him any significant off-field duties. He later stated that his only duties as vice president consisted of making public appearances and autographing tickets. Ruth also found out that far from giving him a share of the profits, Fuchs wanted him to invest some of his money in the team in a last-ditch effort to improve its balance sheet. As it turned out, both Fuchs and Ruppert had <b>known</b> <b>all</b> along that Ruth's non-playing positions were meaningless.|$|E

5|$|With six wins in six matches, the Uruguayan coach Rubén Israel {{qualified}} {{the football}} team of El Salvador for {{the third round of}} the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF). Fallen into the same group as Mexico, Costa Rica and Guyana, El Salvador heroically snatched a draw in San José (Costa Rica) (after being 2–0 down to score) on 8 Jun 2012. Four days later, a home defeat against Mexico (1–2) precipitated the departure of Rubén Israel whose poor relations with Jaime Rodríguez, president of the National Institute of Sport Salvador (INDES) were <b>known</b> <b>all.</b>|$|E
5|$|Finding her mother's body, Buffy {{at first}} denies what she sees, {{to the point}} of imagining {{alternate}} realities. Whedon stated that these mini dream sequences were like documentaries; people who find their loved ones dead are desperate to imagine a different, better outcome, and they create fantasies that cause much more pain when they are forced to return to the harshness of reality. Later in the hospital, Buffy imagines what she {{might have been able to}} do to save Joyce, although the doctor tells her there was nothing to be done. Willow and Xander express anger and helplessness. Anya, new to mortality and human connections, is childlike in her innocence and questions. Xander's anger and Anya's confusion allow them to be mothered somewhat by Willow, who needs to take care of someone. Dawn is deeply in denial, unable to understand that the woman she thought she had <b>known</b> <b>all</b> her life was gone. Tara, who has gone through the ordeal before, represents the acceptance phase, soothing and helping the others to work through what they are experiencing. Buffy toward the end also begins to see acceptance when she tells Dawn that the body in the morgue is not their mother; Joyce is gone.|$|E
5|$|Robert Baer (a former North Jersey {{prosecutor}} and municipal judge) lost {{a breach of}} contract lawsuit he filed against Chase {{in federal court in}} Trenton, New Jersey, alleging he helped create the show, but Baer won a ruling that a jury should decide if and how much Baer should be paid for services as a location scout, researcher, and consultant. The gist of Baer's argument: in addition to Chase's own sources and ideas, some characters, settings, and storylines portrayed in The Sopranos were allegedly inspired by tours and conversations the series creator had with Tony Spirito ("a restaurateur and admitted gambler who says he often did 'favors' such as chauffeuring for wiseguys he had <b>known</b> <b>all</b> his life. His old pals included reputed notorious figure John 'Uncle Johnny' Riggi and Louis 'Fat Lou' LaRasso, a late underboss of the DeCavalcante crime family"), Thomas Koczur (a homicide detective for the Elizabeth Police Department), and people Spirito and Koczur introduced Chase to, in addition to communications and input provided by Baer, who'd introduced Chase to Spirito and Koczur in the first place.|$|E
40|$|Recently, several {{philosophers}} {{have moved}} from a classical account of divine omniscience according to which God <b>knows</b> <b>all</b> truths to a restricted account of divine omniscience according to which God <b>knows</b> <b>all</b> knowable truths. But an important objection offered by Alexander Pruss threatens to show that if God <b>knows</b> <b>all</b> knowable truths, God must also <b>know</b> <b>all</b> truths. In this paper, I {{show that there is}} a way out of Pruss’s objection for the advocate of restricted omniscience if she will define her view in terms of ways of knowing rather than in terms of logical possibilities...|$|R

25|$|In 1898, Kelvin {{predicted}} that only 400 years of oxygen supply {{remained on the}} planet, due to the rate of burning combustibles. In his calculation, Kelvin assumed that photosynthesis was {{the only source of}} free oxygen; he did not know all of the components of the oxygen cycle. He could not even have <b>known</b> <b>all</b> of the sources of photosynthesis: for example the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus—which accounts {{for more than half of}} marine photosynthesis—was not discovered until 1986.|$|E
25|$|Giraud's escape {{was soon}} <b>known</b> <b>all</b> over France. Pierre Laval {{tried to persuade}} him to return to Germany.

In retaliation, Heinrich Himmler ordered the Gestapo to try to assassinate him and to arrest any members of Giraud's family that could be found, who would be held hostage in order to discourage Giraud from cooperating with the Allies. Seventeen members of Giraud's extended family were arrested.|$|E
25|$|A {{combinatorial}} problem {{related to}} the number of inputs and outputs of the RC4 cipher was first posed by Itsik Mantin and Adi Shamir in 2001, whereby, of the total 256 elements in the typical state of RC4, if x number of elements (x ≤ 256) are only <b>known</b> (<b>all</b> other elements can be assumed empty), then the maximum number of elements that can be produced deterministically is also x in the next 256 rounds. This conjecture was put to rest in 2004 with a formal proof given by Souradyuti Paul and Bart Preneel.|$|E
