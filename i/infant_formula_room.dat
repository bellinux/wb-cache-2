Currently, soy-based <b>infant</b> <b>formulas</b> account for approximately 25 percent of the formulas marketed in the United States.

Infants fed with soy-based <b>infant</b> <b>formulas</b> are exposed to substantial levels of soy isoflavones, which are phytoestrogens with potential hormonal activity due to their chemical similarity to endogenous estrogen. Isoflavones possess weak estrogenic activity and could theoretically negatively affect endocrine development.

Samples were purchased at a local pharmacy and differed in composition. Lactose free <b>infant</b> <b>formula,</b> gluten free <b>infant</b> <b>formula</b> and <b>infant</b> <b>formulas</b> containing dietary fibers and probiotics were tested and compared with a regular <b>infant</b> <b>formula</b> sample which did not contain any of these supplements.

There {{were no significant differences}} in bulk densities of the samples, therefore the connection between flow properties and bulk density could not be determined. Lactose free <b>infant</b> <b>formula</b> showed flow properties different to standard supplement-free sample. Gluten free <b>infant</b> <b>formula</b> with addition of probiotic microorganisms and dietary fiber had the narrowest particle size distribution range and exhibited the best flow properties.

Methods: Data collected as part of the Cork BASELINE Birth Cohort Study examined infant feeding practices at 2, 6 and 12 months of age.

The presence {{of some of these}} fatty acids in <b>infant</b> <b>formula,</b> however, can be harmful and toxic for the infant.

Therefore, a limit has been set by the Codex Alimentarius for the presence of erucic acid in <b>infant</b> <b>formula</b> (less than 1 % of total fatty acids). The purpose of the present study is to investigate amount of erucic acid present in three <b>infant</b> <b>formulas</b> used predominantly in Iran. Methods: Gas chromatography (GC) is a valuable method applied for the separation of fatty acids, including erucic acid, from oils and oily food.

40|$|The Selenium {{content of}} <b>infant</b> <b>formulae</b> varies {{as a result}} of {{differences}} in the amount of intrinsic selenium compounds. Manufacturers have been gradually changing the protein profile of <b>infant</b> <b>formula</b> to reflect human milk contents more closely. Because of these variations in <b>infant</b> <b>formula</b> composition and their potential impact on selenium content, this trace element was analysed with regard to the different protein sources. The aims of this study were to determine the selenium content in <b>infant</b> <b>formulae</b> sold commercially in Spain, to estimate a daily dietary intake for <b>infants</b> fed on <b>formulae</b> and to compare with the selenium provided by Spanish breast milk samples used as a reference. We have also identified certain trace elements added to formulae which interact with selenium according to type and protein matrix of <b>infant</b> <b>formula.</b> Selenium concentration was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) with a hydride generator. The selenium concentrations in human milk and <b>infant</b> <b>formula</b> determined in this study are similar to those found by other researchers in different countries. Daily intake of studied formulae was estimated according to recommended doses from manufacturers. Theoretical intake of lactating infants has been studied in relation to the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA: 10 μg Se/day) and the specific recommendations for <b>infant</b> <b>formula</b> nutrient contents (10 – 35 μg/L) set by Expert Panel of Life Sciences Research Office (LSRO) of the American Society for Nutritional Sciences. According to our results, on an overall view, infants fed on the studied <b>infant</b> <b>formulae</b> have an intake between the basal and normative requirements. This might be considered to provide an adequate selenium intake. However, several formulae included in this research could provide an intake of selenium that does not reach the RDA for the first month of neonate life...|$|R

50|$|China's <b>infant</b> <b>formula</b> {{brand is}} highly {{fragmented}} {{with more than}} 100 brands of which only {{a dozen or so}} are significant. Definitions {{of the size of the}} pediatric milk product market vary depending on the extent to which <b>infant</b> <b>formula</b> products sold outside the modern trade sector are measured. According to Euromonitor International, in 2011 China's sales volume of <b>infant</b> <b>formula</b> market in China reached RMB62.1 billion. Euromonitor forecast that compound annual growth rate from 2011 to 2016 would be 15.6%, while the 2016 market size will reach RMB128.4 billion. (approx. USD$21 billion). These figures suggest that in 2011 Yashili's share of China's <b>infant</b> <b>formula</b> market was around 1.6%. These figures also suggest that the total market in 2012 was RMB72 billion (USD$11.6 billion).|$|R
