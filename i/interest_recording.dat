5000|$|This book {{tells the}} story of Anton Furey, a charismatic {{therapist}} who is dying. It details the familial relationships during this time, which includes his five kids, his wife's three kids and the child they have together. That child -- Alice -- then moves back to the farm where she was raised (Chardin). While the family lived there - in a communal lifestyle - they got the reputation of being the new American blended family. Because of that reporters and film crews took an <b>interest,</b> <b>recording</b> their lifestyle.|$|E
40|$|Panama, {{the narrowest}} {{strip of land}} of Central America, hosts two sites inscribed on the World Heritage List: the Archaeological site of Panama Viejo (XVI cent.) and the Fortresses of Portobelo and San Lorenzo (XVII-XVIII cent.). In order to support the {{conservation}} and valorisation of these places, in 2014 a collaboration work was started between the Patronage of Panama Viejo, the Patronage of Portobelo and San Lorenzo, the Institute of Atmospheric Sciences and Climate of the Italian National Research Council (ISAC-CNR) and the Department of Earth Sciences of the University of Ferrara. As a first step, the study was devoted to the characterization and {{the evaluation of the}} state of conservation of the building materials, obtained by mineralogical-petrographic, physical and chemical analyses (PLM, XRD, SEM-EDX, XRF, MIP and IC). Successively, {{in order to determine the}} environmental context, a selection of monitoring stations, near the sites of <b>interest,</b> <b>recording</b> climate parameters (near-surface air temperature, relative humidity and rainfall amount), have been selected among the network of the Authority Panama Canal. Moreover, the same parameters were collected from ARPEGE climate models (Déqué, 2010), both historical and scenario simulations, in order to utilize them for future damage predictions. Indeed, utilizing environmental data and applying specific damage functions it is possible to assess the deterioration phenomena occurring on heritage materials, for instance surface recession, biomass accumulation and transition of salts (respectively Bonazza et al., 2009; Gómez-Bolea et al., 2012; Grossi et al., 2011), as demonstrated within the 6 FP EC Noah's Ark Project (Sabbioni et al., 2012). Therefore, this research work has allowed us to produce projections of possible climate change impacts on the Panamanian heritage, for the near to the far future (2011 - 2100), compared to the recent past (1985 - 2010) ...|$|E
40|$|Mangroves supply {{important}} {{services to}} tropical and subtropical {{communities around the}} world, but these delicate ecosystems have been degraded, sometimes destroyed, for development interests such as tourism, charcoal concessions, intensive shrimp aquaculture, and growing populations. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is restoring mangroves at two sites in Koh Klang, an island in Krabi, Thailand. The process centers around teaching the surrounding community {{about the benefits of}} mangroves as food sources, fish nurseries, and in terms of disaster risk reduction, the ability of mangroves to protect nearby communities from floods, erosion, salinization, and wind. IUCN promotes the natural regeneration of mangroves, which involves attending to the hydrology and topography of the site to provide a habitat where seedlings can take root, and very limited mangrove planting. Silvofisheries are incorporated into the project to ensure a tangible economic benefit for site owners {{that can be used to}} garner community <b>interest.</b> <b>Recording</b> the successes of this process and using the results to educate the Thai government and other NGOs on the benefits of natural regeneration with silvofisheries is an integral part of the project. The intervention is in its very early stages so the benefits to-date are small, but through measurement surveys and studies at multiple stages, a record of the project 2 ̆ 7 s impact on socioeconomics will eventually provide evidence that the natural regeneration of mangroves with silvofisheries is an ideal approach. After describing potential measurement strategies, we conclude with recommendations for IUCN regarding up-scale and knowledge dissemination. For example, it is critical that IUCN broach complicated issue of property rights with the government and lobby for policy reform before the owners of abandoned ponds will allow mangroves to regenerate en masse...|$|E

5000|$|In 1992, Shear self-released a {{collection}} called [...] "Wires", which generated some buzz among minor {{radio stations and}} underground magazines, but still little <b>interest</b> from <b>record</b> labels.

50|$|At {{the same}} time, just as Garage was losing momentum, Grime was {{creating}} interest.

[...] In October 1967, a fourteen-song demo tape was copyrighted and the compositions were registered with Dwarf Music, a publishing company jointly owned by Dylan and Grossman.

50|$|The {{band was}} founded in 1980 by Andrew Eldritch and Gary Marx in Leeds. Up to 1983, the band {{produced}} five singles and two EPs, which were released on the band's own indie label Merciful Release and were distributed independently as well. As the band became increasingly successful and featured regularly in the UK Indie Chart, a first studio album was announced in 1983 for the following year. Eldritch estimated the production costs at £40,000, a sum which exceeded the financial capabilities of an indie band. Around the same time talks with <b>interested</b> <b>record</b> labels began.|$|R

50|$|After the {{purchase}} of Oakley House by the 4th Duke, the old house was demolished and a new (present) one was built on its site.

In 1795, the Oakley Reynes Pre-Enclosure map was drawn, and in 1803 Oakley was enclosed. As a matter of <b>interest,</b> <b>records</b> have been discovered that show the annual expenditure of the Church from Easter 1821 to Easter 1822 as being £2.7s.3d. (£2.36).

50|$|Few have {{disputed the}} fact that Charm is one of Danny!'s strongest works to date, with much of its content either based on events that had {{actually}} transpired in Danny!'s life, or that would eerily play itself out {{in the wake of}} Charm 's success (for example, receiving a phone call from an <b>interested</b> <b>record</b> label). The record would go on to quietly achieve a great deal of success: music critics applauded his efforts immensely, media websites began hosting his discography and in October 2006, the first of two ballots drafted for the Grammy Awards of 2007 nomination process included songs from Charm in four different fields, spanning seven categories.|$|R
