25|$|Dark current: The current {{through the}} {{photodiode}} {{in the absence}} of light, when it is operated in photoconductive mode. The <b>dark</b> <b>current</b> includes photocurrent generated by background radiation and the saturation current of the semiconductor junction. <b>Dark</b> <b>current</b> must be accounted for by calibration if a photodiode is used to make an accurate optical power measurement, and it is also a source of noise when a photodiode is used in an optical communication system.|$|E
25|$|A {{photodiode}} is a p–n junction or PIN structure. When a photon {{of sufficient}} energy strikes the diode, it creates an electron-hole pair. This mechanism {{is also known}} as the inner photoelectric effect. If the absorption occurs in the junction's depletion region, or one diffusion length away from it, these carriers are swept from the junction by the built-in electric field of the depletion region. Thus holes move toward the anode, and electrons toward the cathode, and a photocurrent is produced. The total current through the photodiode is the sum of the <b>dark</b> <b>current</b> (current that is generated in the absence of light) and the photocurrent, so the <b>dark</b> <b>current</b> must be minimized to maximize the sensitivity of the device.|$|E

40|$|Several {{improved}} {{designs for}} complementary metal oxide/semiconductor (CMOS) integrated-circuit image detectors have been developed, primarily to reduce <b>dark</b> <b>currents</b> (leakage currents) and secondarily to increase responses to blue light and increase signal-handling capacities, relative {{to those of}} prior CMOS imagers. The main conclusion that {{can be drawn from}} a study of the causes of <b>dark</b> <b>currents</b> in prior CMOS imagers is that <b>dark</b> <b>currents</b> could be reduced by relocating p/n junctions away from Si/SiO 2 interfaces.

40|$|A {{specially}} designed barrier (B) is inserted at the n-pi junction [where most GR (generation-recombination) processes take place] {{in the standard}} n-pi-p structure to substantially reduce generation-recombination <b>dark</b> <b>currents.</b> The resulting n-Bpi- p structure also has reduced tunneling <b>dark</b> <b>currents,</b> thereby solving some of the limitations to which current type II strained layer superlattice infrared detectors are prone.

2500|$|In {{this mode}} the diode is often reverse biased (with the cathode driven {{positive}} {{with respect to}} the anode). [...] This reduces the response time because the additional reverse bias increases the width of the depletion layer, which decreases the junction's capacitance. The reverse bias also increases the <b>dark</b> <b>current</b> without much change in the photocurrent. For a given spectral distribution, the photocurrent is linearly proportional to the illuminance (and to the irradiance).|$|E
2500|$|The photocathodes {{can be made}} of {{a variety}} of materials, with {{different}} properties. Typically the materials have low work function and are therefore prone to thermionic emission, causing noise and <b>dark</b> <b>current,</b> especially the materials sensitive in infrared; cooling the photocathode lowers this thermal noise. The most common photocathode materials are Ag-O-Cs (also called S1) transmission-mode, sensitive from 300–1200nm. High dark current; used mainly in near-infrared, with the photocathode cooled; GaAs:Cs, caesium-activated gallium arsenide, flat response from 300 to 850nm, fading towards ultraviolet and to 930nm; InGaAs:Cs, caesium-activated indium gallium arsenide, higher infrared sensitivity than GaAs:Cs, between 900–1000nm much higher signal-to-noise ratio than Ag-O-Cs; Sb-Cs, (also called S11) caesium-activated antimony, used for reflective mode photocathodes; response range from ultraviolet to visible, widely used; bialkali (Sb-K-Cs, Sb-Rb-Cs), caesium-activated antimony-rubidium or antimony-potassium alloy, similar to Sb:Cs, with higher sensitivity and lower noise. can be used for transmission-mode; favorable response to a NaI:Tl scintillator flashes makes them widely used in gamma spectroscopy and radiation detection; [...] high-temperature bialkali (Na-K-Sb), can operate up to 175°C, used in well logging, low <b>dark</b> <b>current</b> at room temperature; multialkali (Na-K-Sb-Cs), (also called S20), wide spectral response from ultraviolet to near-infrared, special cathode processing can extend range to 930nm, used in broadband spectrophotometers; solar-blind (Cs-Te, Cs-I), sensitive to vacuum-UV and ultraviolet, insensitive to visible light and infrared (Cs-Te has cutoff at 320nm, Cs-I at 200nm).|$|E
