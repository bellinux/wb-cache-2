40|$|A {{research}} paper highlighting the disparities between land reform programme policies and their implimantation in Zimbabwe. Land {{is a natural}} resource {{that has always been}} hotly contested among groups of people living between the Zambezi and the Limpopo. Before the arrival of the first European settlers over a century ago, bloody tribal and ethnic battles were fought for land. The Europeans found two major tribes, Shona and Ndebele living in the now Zimbabwe. The livelihood of the former tribe was based on agricultural and pastoral activities while that of the latter was largely based on highly organised military structures. In both cases, the nucleus of the government was composed of the Chief, supported by councillors and headmen The colonial conquest of the country by the British in the late 1880 s destroyed these systems and subordinated the African people in both political and economic terms. Economic subordination started by the passing of the Land Apportionment Act in 1930, which formalised racial separation of land. Africans lost their coveted land and substantial economic power as they were driven to marginal areas with inherently poor soils and erratic rainfall. Although farming was part of their livelihoods and the sole source of food and income, a series of repressive legislation prohibited them from participating on the mainstream of the economy. This, apparently led the disgruntled majority blacks to take arms and fight a protracted war against the injustices. In 1980, they won political independence and the new ZANU PF government promised the empowerment of the people by giving them land. A policy tool identified for this purpose was the land redistribution and resettlement programme. <b>Friedrich</b> <b>Ebert</b> Stiftung <b>Foundation...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{treatise}} {{on the politics}} behind Zimbabwe's land reform programme. The high profile land occupations in Zimbabwe from 1998 onwards are a manifestation {{of a much larger}} phenomenon currently underway across the South. In Latin America and Asia, as well as in other African countries, there has been a resurgence of mass land occupations in the 1990 s (James Petras, 1997, Satumino M. Borras, 1998, Sam Moyo et al). While iocai and national differences may be observed, these movements share common grievances arising from unresolved land questions (agrarian questions more broadly). They share also a common location in the development dialogue as ‘rural poor’ and as subject to welfarist ‘rural development’ programmes. And they share their effective exclusion from a ‘civil society’ that conforms to the ‘proper’ procedure and content of ‘oppositional’ politics in accordance with the liberal formula. This formula values ‘independent’ civic organisation, where ‘independent’ means dissociation from the state, not donors; 'multi-party democracy’, at a time when political parties can no longer differ in their substantive (neoliberal) politics; and respect for the ‘rule of law’, defined by private property, ‘independent’ judiciary (meaning bourgeois), and free’ press (meaning private). The liberal formula has been deployed world-wide in the 1990 s throughout the liberalising world, has gained ready adherence by national bourgeoisies and has co-opted organised working class politics. It {{should come as no surprise}} therefore that, along with deepening poverty and proliferating rural violence over the last two decades, there have emerged both organised and spontaneous rural movements, outside the ‘civil’ framework, seeking to transform inherited property regimes, as well as national policy-making processes (Christobal Kay, 2000, Mats Berdal and David Keen, 1997). <b>Friedrich</b> <b>Ebert</b> Stiftung <b>Foundation...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{position}} {{paper on the}} impact of land distribution on the Zimbabwean Eco-system particularly its effects on rural development programmes. Environment degradation and sustainability of resettlement schemes has been a concern of most among the donor community based on their responses to the proposals presented at the Donor Conference. Government proposals argued that resettlement will lead to intensification of land utilisation as well as bring into production land that has hitherto been idle. Settlers who predominantly are for communal farmers use firewood as source of energy. Given this, it is expected that resettlement would lead to high rates of deforestation. Further settler households bring with them poor animal husbandry practices that have led to land degradation in communal areas. Generally, bringing together farmers from different areas destroys the traditional structures that helped in resource conservation, and the diversity of these farmers precludes emergence of such structures under resettlement. However, some have argued that because of lack of resources settler families have only achieved a fraction of land utilisation practised by former commercial farmers. Also because most of them are poor there is less animals per unit area compared to an average communal area. Thus arguments that resettlement invariably leads to land degradation are baseless. This chapter seeks to review the environmental impacts of the fast track land reform on the biophysical environment. Other aspects of the environment i. e. socioeconomic have been addressed elsewhere in this volume. This chapter begins with a quick synopsis {{of the impact of the}} programme on land cover (vegetation), soils and water. It also looks at issues of the institutional set up for the management of natural resources in the resettlement areas and concludes by recommending some framework for improving the management of natural resources in resettlement areas. <b>Friedrich</b> <b>Ebert</b> Stiftung <b>Foundation...</b>|$|R
