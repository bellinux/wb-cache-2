I don't have many friends in my personal life, but I have so many fans. So when I go outside and people recognize me, it's kind of a bittersweet feeling, like I don't recognize the fans. I don't really have it like they probably think I have it. I'm really still a loser guy, but I'm just really popular now. I don't have a girlfriend no more, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>this</b> money, but I'm not satisfied with my life. It's this weird feeling of being incomplete, and I need to find myself. So that's kind of what it did to me, and the album just came out with me just fucking rapping some dark shit.|$|E

That's all <b>I</b> <b>had.</b> Why did <b>I</b> want a room and a garden? I just chose {{it to be the}} point of departure. The garden is somehow a personal nature, a personal kind of control of nature.

[...] "I wanted to do a record with him on FutureSex/LoveSounds..." [...] he explained [...] "...and he at that time had done a record with Beyoncé, it was 'Déjà Vu.' And he said—respectfully, I can't knock him for saying like <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>this</b> one feature, I think he was working on his own music as well so he didn't want to be on too many things. And I said, 'I totally respect that. I'm obviously not gonna get into any domestic anything. That's your wife.' But the record was 'My Love.' And it ended up being an interesting blessing in disguise because I think Tip for that record—I mean his verse is phenomenal." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} Li'l Sebastian, {{a miniature}} horse beloved by {{the residents of}} Pawnee, was first introduced in [...] "Harvest Festival", which was also written by Goor. The writers considered having a human character die in [...] "Li'l Sebastian" [...] rather than the miniature horse, like previously-mentioned characters Mayor Gunderson or Councilman Bill Dexhart. However, they decided that having an animal character die felt less morbid and more appropriate for the finale of a comedy series. The episode ends with Tom and Jean-Ralphio in their new Entertainment 720 headquarters, a completely white [...] room with modern decor and unusual furniture. Schur described the setting as [...] "maybe the craziest thing that's ever been on our series. ... Every time I watch it in the edit bay, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>this</b> weird crisis: 'Is this OK that this scene is how we're ending this entire season?' It's truly nuts.

500|$|... "Love the Way You Lie" [...] and [...] "Love the Way You Lie (Part II)" [...] {{were based}} on a demo written and {{recorded}} in late 2009 by Grey. Grey told PopEater [...] "I wrote the demo initially for myself because I thought, ‘Oh, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>this</b> big song, and now I {{have a little bit of}} a launching pad to put out my own stuff." [...] Grey continued to discuss how the song was ultimately included on Loud, saying [...] "As soon as Rihanna and her team heard my demo, they were like, ‘Oh we want it for Rihanna’s album,’ so I had to make the decision if I was going to let them have it or not. But I did and so it was on Rihanna’s album, too." [...] The demo track by Grey is on her extended play The Buried Sessions of Skylar Grey, which was released on January 17, 2012.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{signing with}} Arsenal, club manager Wenger likened the player to former club player Patrick Vieira. Wenger {{compared}} the two {{primarily because of}} the similarities between each player's physical appearance and positional preference. While the two are similar in appearance, Diaby has admitted that there are huge differences, stating, [...] "I think maybe I am more attack-minded, a more technical player," [...] and, [...] "Vieira is much more aggressive. He makes more of a physical impact in a game, in midfield. He is amazing. I don’t think <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>this</b> quality yet. I think I can develop in that way but he is much stronger." [...] In 2009, Wenger echoed Diaby's sentiments, stating, [...] "I believe Vieira was more of a passer of the ball. Diaby is more of a dribbler, more offensive and makes more penetrating runs. Vieira was more of a constructor. They have a similar elegance and type of play but are not completely comparable".|$|E
500|$|Since 2016, Chabon {{has been}} {{an outspoken critic of}} Donald Trump, both during his {{campaign}} for the presidency (signing a petition with over 400 other writers against his presidency in May 2016), and during his administration. During an interview with The Guardian before Trump's inauguration in January 2017, Chabon remarked of the incoming president, [...] "I really have no idea what to expect. He’s so unpredictable. He’s so mercurial. You know, I would be no more surprised if he stood up there and declared amnesty for all illegal immigrants to the United States than if {{he said he was going}} to take them all out to be shot. He’s like a random impulse generator." [...] In a 2017 radio interview, Chabon spoke of President Trump and said: “Every morning I wake up and in the seconds before I turn my phone on to see what the latest news is, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>this</b> boundless sense of optimism and hope that this is the day that he’s going to have a massive stroke, and, you know, be carted out of the White House on a gurney." ...|$|E
500|$|Niffenegger is {{an artist}} {{who teaches at the}} Center for Book and Paper Arts at Columbia College Chicago, where she prepares editions of handpainted books. She {{produced}} some of her earlier works in editions of ten copies, which were sold in art galleries. However, she decided that The Time Traveler's Wife {{would have to be a}} novel: [...] "I got the idea for the title, and when I draw <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>this</b> big drawing table covered with brown paper, and I write ideas down on the paper. So I wrote down this title and after a while I started to think about it. I couldn't think of a way to make it a picture book because still pictures don't represent time very well, so I decided to write a novel." [...] She was intrigued by the title because [...] "it immediately defined two people and their relationship to each other". Niffenegger said that its source was an epigraph to J. B. Priestley's 1964 novel Man and Time: [...] "Clock time is our bank manager, tax collector, police inspector; this inner time is our wife." [...] Drawing her central theme from this image, she says, [...] "Henry is not only married to Clare; he's also married to time." [...] Other authors whom Niffenegger has cited as influencing the book include Richard Powers, David Foster Wallace, Henry James, and Dorothy Sayers.|$|E

500|$|However, {{in a more}} mixed review, Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times {{felt that}} the song [...] "seems {{as if it were}} written by a ninth-grader imagining her rebellious college sister’s lifestyle" [...] and felt that it lacked {{creativity}} within Cyrus' catalog. Writing for Rolling Stone, Jon Dolan was skeptical of Cyrus' increasingly provocative image, stating that the lyrics in the chorus would be [...] "an odd fit for any singer" [...] and opining that [...] "there's still a bit too much Disney in her voice to fill the track." [...] Naomi Zeichner of The Fader praised the song, writing, [...] "Cyrus said in her recent MTV doc (...) , that she chose it to be her album's first single: 'Not everyone {{came to me and said}} okay, you've got the first single. I had to say no, I know this is it and I'll go to battle if I have to, against anyone who doesn't believe in it. Now <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>this</b> freedom to do whatever I want, because people trust me.' She was right about this one. The song's straightforward party is now tied to a sordid universe of visuals- the official video and the VMA performance." [...] Common Sense Media gave the song two stars out of five saying that [...] "After listening to the weird intro to [...] "We Can't Stop" [...] you'll kind of wish the song did just stop right there." ...|$|E

2500|$|When her 1980 song [...] "If You Ever Change Your Mind" [...] was {{nominated}} for a Grammy award in the category Best Country Vocal Performance, the singer found herself competing in the same category with Sissy Spacek, who {{was nominated}} for title song from Coal Miner's Daughter (1980), the acclaimed biopic in which Spacek portrayed Gayle's sister Loretta Lynn. Anne Murray's [...] "Could <b>I</b> <b>Have</b> <b>This</b> Dance" [...] won the award. Gayle's next album, Hollywood, Tennessee, was her most blatant attempt at country crossover. The album's A-side, [...] "Hollywood", was pop while the album's B-side, [...] "Tennessee", was country. The album's three singles all reached the Country Top 10, but only the first single, [...] "The Woman in Me", reached the Hot 100 (No. 76).

I find pleasure a difficult thing; I don't know what you do with it, I don't know where to put it."
