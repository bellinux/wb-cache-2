5|$|Brown {{pelicans}} and double-crested cormorants {{are mainly}} found on cliffs {{along the coast}} and on seastacks, while sandpipers and gulls inhabit the seacoast and inland areas. Inland, freshwater-dependent birds such as the common merganser, osprey, red-shouldered hawk, great blue heron, and Steller's jay {{are a few of}} the bird species that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>documented.</b> At least 400 bird species <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>documented</b> in the forestlands.|$|E

5|$|The {{biodiversity}} {{of local}} oceanic fauna {{is not well}} understood. Sea turtles and mammals, including monk seals, fin whales (only 1 sighting and 5 strandings <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>documented</b> in Turkish waters), and dolphins are considered to reside in the park area, although regularity of occurrences are unclear.|$|E
5|$|The known outtakes {{from the}} Freewheelin album are as follows.

5|$|The {{wings are}} powered directly, unlike most {{families}} of insects, with the flight muscles {{attached to the}} wing bases. Dragonflies have a high power/weight ratio, and <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>documented</b> accelerating at 4 G linearly and 9 G in sharp turns while pursuing prey.|$|E
5|$|Three types <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>documented</b> in the Antarctic. Two dwarf species, named Orcinus nanus and Orcinus glacialis, were {{described}} during the 1980s by Soviet researchers, but most cetacean researchers are skeptical about their status, and linking these {{directly to the}} types described below is difficult.|$|E
5|$|A Javan {{rhinoceros}} has {{not been}} exhibited in a zoo for over a century. In the 19th century, at least four rhinos were exhibited in Adelaide, Calcutta, and London. At least 22 Javan rhinos <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>documented</b> as having been kept in captivity; the true number is possibly greater, as the species was sometimes confused with the Indian rhinoceros.|$|E

5|$|About 100 {{separate}} {{stations for}} box huckleberry <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>documented</b> {{in the scientific}} literature. By the time of Baird's collection in 1845, the West Virginia stations of the plant had been lost to science, and his Pennsylvania colony {{was the only one}} known for some time. Specimens of box huckleberry were subsequently identified in Delaware in 1870, by William M. Canby.|$|E
5|$|Adults have {{extremely}} variable lifespans, from {{weeks to}} years, {{depending on the}} species. Some wood-boring beetles can have extremely long life-cycles. It is believed that when furniture or house timbers are infested by beetle larvae, the timber already contained the larvae {{when it was first}} sawn up. A birch bookcase 40 years old released adult Eburia quadrigeminata (Cerambycidae), while Buprestis aurulenta and other Buprestidae <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>documented</b> as emerging as much as 51 years after manufacture of wooden items.|$|E
5|$|All {{those with}} a risk of {{exposure}} to body fluids such as blood should be vaccinated, if not already. Testing to verify effective immunization is recommended and further doses of vaccine are given {{to those who are}} not sufficiently immunized. In 10- to 22-year follow-up studies there were no cases of hepatitis B among {{those with a}} normal immune system who were vaccinated. Only rare chronic infections <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>documented.</b>|$|E

5|$|American {{alligators}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>documented</b> using lures to hunt prey such as birds. This {{means they}} are among the first reptiles recorded to use tools. By balancing sticks and branches on their heads, American alligators are able to lure birds looking for suitable nesting material to kill and consume. This strategy, which is shared by the mugger crocodile, is particularly effective during the nesting season, in which birds are more likely to gather appropriate nesting materials.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{high risk}} of predation, {{dolphins}} often avoid regions inhabited by tiger sharks. Injured or ailing whales may also be attacked and eaten. A group was documented killing an ailing humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) in 2006 near Hawaii. A scavenger, the tiger shark will feed on dead whales, and <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>documented</b> doing so alongside great whites.|$|E
5|$|Early blades <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>documented</b> as {{far back}} as 550-500,000 years in the Kapthurin Formation in Kenya and Kathu Pan in South Africa. Backed pieces from the Twin Rivers and Kalambo Falls sites in Zambia, dated at {{sometime}} between 300 and 140,000 years, likewise indicate a suite of new behaviors. A high level of technical competence is also indicated for the c. 280 ka blades recovered from the Kapthurin Formation, Kenya.|$|E

5|$|Revolving bookcase: Revolving bookcases, {{known as}} zhuanluntang, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>documented</b> in ancient China, and its {{invention}} is credited to Fu Xi in 544. Descriptions of revolving bookcases {{have been found}} in 8th- and 9th-century Chinese texts. Revolving bookcases were popularized in Buddhist monasteries during the Song Dynasty under the reign of Emperor Taizu, who ordered the mass printing of the Buddhist Tripiṭaka scriptures. An illustration of a revolving bookcase is depicted in Li Jie's architectural treatise the Yingzao Fashi.|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>documented</b> {{that can help}} confirm the identify of this species. On the cap flesh, application of formaldehyde turns the tissue pinkish, iron salts result in a colour change to greyish-green, aniline causes a lavender to reddish-brown colour, and phenol a purplish pink to reddish brown. On the cap cuticle, nitric acid causes an orange-salmon colour, sulphuric acid creates orange-red, ammonia usually makes brown, and a potassium hydroxide solution usually makes orange.|$|E
5|$|The fauna of Puerto Rico {{has been}} {{subjected}} to human influence since the arrival of the Ortoiroid, Puerto Rico's first settlers, approximately 4,000 years ago. The native fauna was used by the island's indigenous population as a source of food, while others were used for skins and trade. Significant declines in the populations and diversity of the islands fauna are believed to have begun after the arrival of European settlers in the sixteenth century. Habitat destruction, primarily as a result of forest clearing for sugar cane plantations, had a devastating effect on Puerto Rican fauna during {{the latter half of the}} nineteenth century. Furthermore, human-introduced species such as rats, cats, the small Asian mongoose, and the cane toad have had a profound effect on the native fauna of Puerto Rico. Rats on Monito Island are believed to be a limiting factor on the abundance of the endemic Monito gecko, feral cats on Mona Island <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>documented</b> attacking common ground doves and endemic reptiles, and have been associated with the reduction of Mona ground iguana juveniles, and mongooses <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>documented</b> preying on Puerto Rican parrot fledgings.|$|E
