5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{a series of}} letters between Eldon {{businessmen}} and Carl E. Smith, the newly-inherited owner of the house, revealed differing opinions on continued use of the house: Smith wanted to renovate the house and protect it from vandalism only; the Eldon leaders were more in favor of making the house a historic site. The house was abandoned {{for much of the}} 1970s—a bullet was fired in an upstairs bedroom; weather and vandalism took their toll as well. Only in the late 1980s did the owner of the property consider turning the house over to the state. Indeed, many southern Iowans were conflicted on the issue—the owner wanted to keep the house only because he believed the current renters would <b>have</b> <b>nowhere</b> else to go if they were forced to leave.|$|E

500|$|In {{the days}} {{immediately}} after World War I, Piłsudski attempted {{to build a}} government in a shattered country. Much of former Russian Poland had been destroyed in the war, and systematic looting by the Germans had reduced the region's wealth by at least 10%. A British diplomat who visited Warsaw in January 1919 reported: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>nowhere</b> seen anything like the evidences of extreme poverty and wretchedness that meet one's eye at almost every turn".|$|E
500|$|Like [...] "Sat Singing", [...] "Lay His Head" [...] was {{recorded}} during the sessions for Somewhere in England, in April 1980. The title {{refers to a}} phrase from the gospels of St Matthew and St Luke that Harrison had taken to quoting when referring {{to the lack of}} privacy afforded him and his Beatles bandmates during the 1960s. In his adaptation, the phrase became: [...] "Foxes have holes and birds have nests, but Beatles <b>have</b> <b>nowhere</b> to lay their heads." [...] Leng views the song as a reflection on [...] "what a man loses when he becomes a media entity: a connection with other people that everyone else takes for granted".|$|E
500|$|In 2013, Padukone {{established}} {{herself as}} a leading actress of contemporary Hindi cinema by featuring {{in four of the}} top-grossing productions of the year. She collaborated with Saif Ali Khan for the fourth time (alongside John Abraham, Jacqueline Fernandez, Ameesha Patel, and Anil Kapoor) in Abbas-Mustan's Race 2, an ensemble action thriller that served as a sequel to the 2008 film Race. The film received predominantly negative reviews from critics, but with a total collection of , it proved to be a commercial success. In a particularly scathing review, Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV wrote that both Padukone and Fernandez [...] "strut around like wound-up automatons that are all decked-up but <b>have</b> <b>nowhere</b> to go." ...|$|E

500|$|Michael Tedder of New York {{praised the}} writers work and for giving [...] "nice {{character}} moments" [...] to the cast, particularly Kinsey. He also praised them for giving Kinsey [...] "more to work with", comparing {{her role in}} previous episodes which featured her character being [...] "exaggerated to cartoon levels {{for the sake of}} a laugh". ScreenCrush reviewer Damon Houx was slightly more critical with his review, writing that while the cast was quite good, the episode was too struggled with [...] "find stuff for everyone to do", and that the Pete-Erin-Pam and Jim-Stanley-Phyllis subplots [...] "ultimately <b>have</b> <b>nowhere</b> interesting to go". Multiple critics noted similarities between the style of this episode with the early seasons of the series, particularly for its use of callbacks.|$|E
500|$|The Tom Cruise {{video is}} {{referred}} to specifically {{at the start of}} the Anonymous YouTube video posting, and is characterized as a [...] "propaganda video". The video utilizes a synthesized voice and shows floating cloud images using a time lapse method as the speaker addresses the leaders of Scientology directly: [...] "We shall proceed to expel you from the Internet and systematically dismantle the Church of Scientology in its present form..." [...] The video goes on to state: [...] "We recognize you as serious opponents, and do not expect our campaign to be completed in a short time frame. However, you will not prevail forever against the angry masses of the body politic. Your choice of methods, your hypocrisy, and the general artlessness of your organization have sounded its death knell. You <b>have</b> <b>nowhere</b> to hide because we are everywhere... We are Anonymous. We are Legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget. Expect us." [...] By January 25, 2008, only four days after its release, the video had been viewed 800,000 times, and by February 8, 2008 had been viewed over 2million times. Author Warren Ellis called the video [...] "creepy in and of itself" [...] and a [...] "manifesto, declaration of war, sharp political film".|$|E
500|$|The short {{focused on}} a boy named Pen and a dog named Jake as they learn from the Rainicorn that the Ice King has kidnapped Princess Bubblegum, {{in the hope of}} marrying her. Declaring that it's [...] "Adventure Time", Pen and Jake set off to the Ice King's {{mountain}} lair. Pen and the Ice King fight while Jake remains outside flirting with Lady Rainicorn, ignoring the battle. Just when Pen seems to be gaining the upper hand, the Ice King uses his [...] "frozen lightning bolts" [...] to freeze Pen in a block of ice. For unexplained reasons, this transports Pen's mind back in time, and to Mars, where he has a short motivational conversation with Abraham Lincoln. After being told to believe in himself, Pen's mind is returned to the present, where he breaks out of the ice, {{just in time to see}} the Ice King fly away with Princess Bubblegum. Chasing after him using Jake's extendable legs, Pen rescues the princess from the Ice King's grasp. Jake pushes the magical crown off the Ice King's head, thereby removing the King's source of power. The Ice King then plummets off screen, yelling a long list of complex threats of things he will do when he returns. The story closes with Princess Bubblegum giving Pen a kiss; he enjoys it, but is also greatly embarrassed by the act. He attempts to leave, but Jake claims that they <b>have</b> <b>nowhere</b> else to go and that there are no adventures that need them. However, some nearby ninjas are stealing an old man's diamonds, and they both run off in pursuit.|$|E

500|$|In April 2006, Edward Jones and the ACLU {{sued the}} City of Los Angeles, {{on behalf of}} Robert Lee Purrie and five other {{homeless}} people, for the city's violation of the 8th and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, and Article I, sections 7 and 17 of the California Constitution (supporting due process and equal protection, and prohibiting cruel and unusual punishment). The Court {{ruled in favor of}} the ACLU, stating that, [...] "the LAPD cannot arrest people for sitting, lying, or sleeping on public sidewalks in Skid Row." [...] Enforcement of section 41.18(d) 24 hours a day against persons who <b>have</b> <b>nowhere</b> else to sit, lie, or sleep, other than on public streets and sidewalks, is breaking these amendments. The Court said that the anti-camping ordinance is [...] "one of the most restrictive municipal laws regulating public spaces in the United States". Jones and the ACLU wanted a compromise in which the LAPD is barred from enforcing section 41.18(d) (arrest, seizure, and imprisonment) in Skid Row between the hours of 9:00p.m. and 6:30am. The compromise plan permits the homeless to sleep on the sidewalk, provided they are not [...] "within 10 feet of any business or residential entrance" [...] and only between these hours. One of the motivations for the compromise is the shortage of space in the prison system. Downtown development business interests and the Central City Association (CCA) were against the compromise. Police Chief William Bratton said the case had slowed the police effort to fight crime and clean up Skid Row, and that when he was allowed to clean up Skid Row, real estate profited. On September 20, 2006, the Los Angeles City Council voted to reject the compromise. On October 3, 2006, police arrested Skid Row's transients for sleeping on the streets {{for the first time in}} months.|$|E

2500|$|Suri and Chapman {{argue that}} a net {{pollution}} reduction may not actually be occurring on global scales. Wealthy nations have a trend of exporting the activities that create the most pollution, like manufacturing of clothing and furniture, to poorer nations that {{are still in the}} process of industrial development (Suri and Chapman, 1998). This could mean that as the world's poor nations develop, they will <b>have</b> <b>nowhere</b> to export their pollution. Thus, this progression of environmental clean up occurring in conjunction with economic growth cannot be replicated indefinitely because there may be nowhere to export waste and pollution intensive processes. However, Gene Grossman and Alan B. Krueger, the authors who initially made the correlation between economic growth, environmental clean-up, and the Kuznets curve, conclude that there is [...] "no evidence that environmental quality deteriorates steadily with economic growth." [...] And Yandle et al. conclude that [...] "policies that stimulate growth (trade liberalization, economic restructuring, and price reform) should be good for the environment".|$|E

The United Nations coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Robert Serry condemned the decision: [...] "These actions heighten tensions and undermine international efforts to create conditions for fruitful negotiations to achieve peace." [...] The US State Department called it a [...] violation of Israel's obligations under the Road map for peace. Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said [...] "Tonight, while these new settlers from abroad will be accommodating themselves and their belongings in these Palestinian houses, 19 newly homeless children will <b>have</b> <b>nowhere</b> to sleep."

2500|$|Mitchel {{felt that}} the Government would respond only to [...] "armed opinion": [...] "must the force of opinion always be legal? – always be peaceful? Does opinion then mean law? Does opinion cease to be opinion the moment it {{steps out of the}} {{trenches}} of the constitution? Why, sir, I hold that there is no opinion in Ireland worth a farthing which is not illegal. I hold that armed opinion is a thousand times stronger than unarmed – and further, that in a national struggle that opinion is the most potent whose sword is sharpest, and whose aim is surest. We are told it was opinion and sympathy, and other metaphysical entities that rescued Italy, and scared Austria back from Ferrara without a blow. Yes, but it was opinion with the helmet of a national guard on his head, and a long sword by his side; it was opinion, standing, match in hand, at the breech of a gun charged to the muzzle. Now, I say all this, not to vindicate myself, for I <b>have</b> <b>nowhere</b> recommended the Irish nation to attain legislative independence by force of arms in their present broken and divided condition (as Mr O'Connell's resolution imputes to me), not to vindicate myself, but to vindicate the original free constitution of our confederacy." ...|$|E
