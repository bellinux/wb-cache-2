40|$|Purpose: The {{objectives}} of this thesis were {{to compare the}} clinical and material performance of implant-supported titanium frameworks with <b>gold-alloy</b> frameworks in the edentulous jaw and to test a digitized impression technique to optimize material characteristics and clinical and laboratory procedures. Materials and Methods: Two different kinds of laser-welded titanium frameworks and one type of digitized computer numeric controlled (CNC) -milled titanium framework for the edentulous jaw were evaluated and compared with <b>gold-alloy</b> frameworks in two clinical 5 -year follow-up studies. The CNC frameworks were also evaluated and compared with <b>gold-alloy</b> frameworks in two experimental studies according to fit, preload, and surface roughness. Furthermore, a digitized photogrammetric technique for recording implant positions in the edentulous jaw was experimentally tested and compared with two conventional impression techniques. Results: Laser-welded titanium frameworks had a lower success rate after 5 years in function than <b>gold-alloy</b> frameworks. The 5 -year performance of CNC frameworks {{was similar to that}} of <b>gold-alloy</b> frameworks. The fit and precision of implant-supported CNC frameworks was significantly better compared with <b>gold-alloy</b> frameworks. Applications of veneering material did not significantly affect the fit of the titanium frameworks. The preload of CNC frameworks was similar to that of <b>gold-alloy</b> frameworks, both exhibiting significantly decreased preloads after repeated tightening. The preloads of titanium frameworks were similar before and after veneering. Unloaded milled titanium screw sites had significantly rougher surfaces than loaded sites, and loaded gold screws had rougher surfaces than unloaded. No correlation between surface of the screw joints and preload of veneered titanium frameworks was observed. The precision of photogrammetric impressions was comparable to that of conventional impression techniques. Conclusions: Implant-supported CNC-milled titanium frameworks are a viable alternative to <b>gold-alloy</b> castings in the edentulous jaw, and because a digital platform is used to manufacture these titanium frameworks, photogrammetric impressions can be made...|$|R

40|$|Statement of problem. In vitro {{studies on}} the {{retentive}} strengths of various cements used to retain posts have reported conflicting results. Purpose. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the tensile strength of commercially pure titanium and type III cast <b>gold-alloy</b> posts and cores cemented with zinc phosphate or resin cement. Material and methods. Forty-two extracted human canines were endoclontically treated. The root preparations were accomplished using Largo reamers (10 mm in depth and 1. 7 mm in diameter). Acrylic resin patterns for the posts and cores were made, and specimens were cast in commercially pure titanium and in type III gold alloy (n= 7). Fourteen titanium cast posts and cores were submitted to surface treatment with Kroll acid solution and to scanning electron microscopy (SEM), before and after acid etching. The groups (n= 7) were cemented with zinc phosphate cement or resin cement (Panavia F). Tensile strengths were measured in a universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 0. 5 mm/min. The results (Kgf) were statistically analyzed by 2 -way ANCIVA (alpha=. 05). Results. The 2 -way ANOVA indicated that there were no significant differences among the groups tested. Retentive means for zinc phosphate and Panavia F cements were statistically similar. The bond strength was not Influenced by the alloy, the luting material, or the etching treatment. SEM analysis indicated that the etched surfaces were smoother than those that did not receive surface treatment, but this fact did not influence the results. Conclusions. Commercially pure titanium cast posts and cores cemented with zinc phosphate and resin cements demonstrated similar mean tensile retentive values. Retentive values were also similar to mean values recorded for cast <b>gold-alloy</b> posts and cores cemented with zinc phosphate cement and resin cements...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{chemical}} bonding between {{metal and}} ceramic is aided by non-precious metal atoms and their oxides {{present on the}} metal surface. Aim {{of the study was}} to correlate metal-ceramic bonding with thickness oxide layer on a new gold alloy. METHODS: Thirty-two specimens were constructed in gold alloy and ceramic, with the aim of evaluating the degree (using shear test) and quality (using optical microscope) of bonding resistance between these materials, in relation to the thicknesses of the oxide layer produced on the metallic parts by means of different thermal procedures. RESULTS: Bond strength was practically the same with different thicknesses of the oxide layer. A slight reduction in the degree of bonding was observed in the non-oxidised models. CONCLUSIONS: For the <b>gold-alloy</b> here tested, the oxide layer seems to be not influent in the chemical metal-ceramic bond strengt...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare titanium-reinforced ZrO 2 and pure Al 2 O 3 {{abutments}} regarding their outcome after chewing simulation and static loading. Forty-eight standard diameter implants with an external hexagon were divided into three groups of 16 implants each and restored with three different types of abutments (group A: ZrO 2 abutments with titanium inserts; group B: densely sintered high-purity Al 2 O 3 abutments; group C: titanium abutments). All abutments were fixated on the implants with <b>gold-alloy</b> screws at 32 Ncm torque, and metal crowns were adhesively cemented onto the abutments. The specimens were exposed to 1. 2 million cycles in a chewing simulator. Surviving specimens were subsequently loaded until fracture in a static testing device. Fracture loads (N) and fracture modes were recorded. A Wilcoxon Rank test to compare fracture loads among the 3 groups and a Fisher exact test to detect group differences in fracture modes were used for statistical evaluation (...|$|R
40|$|Effects {{on metal}} targets after an {{explosion}} include the following: fracture, plastic deformation, surface modifications, and microstructural crystallographic alterations with ensuing mechanical properties changes. In {{the case of}} small charge explosions, macroscopic effects are restricted to small charge-to-target distances, whereas crystal alterations can still be observed at moderate distances. Microstructural variations, induced on <b>gold-alloy</b> disk samples, as compared to previous results on AISI 304 Cu steel samples, are illustrated. The samples were subjected to blast-wave overpressures {{in the range of}} 0. 5 to 195 MPa. Minimum distances and peak pressures, which could still yield observable alterations, were especially investigated. Blast-related microstructural features were observed on the explosion-exposed surface and on perpendicular cross sections. Analyses using X-ray diffraction (XRD) were performed to identify modifications of phase, texture, dislocation density, and frequency of mechanical twins, before and after the explosions. Optical metallography (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations evidenced partial surface melting, zones with recrystallization phenomena, and crystal plastic deformation marks. The latter marks are attributed to mechanical twinning in the stainless steel and to cross-slip (prevalent) and mechanical twinning (possibly) in the gold allo...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates some {{mechanical}} {{aspects of}} a new endodontic restoration technique, {{based on the idea}} that the root cavity can be more efficiently filled if multiple prefabricated composite posts (PCP) are employed. Multi-post technique increases bearing capacity and durability of endodontically-treated teeth, as shown by numerical simulations performed through 3 D elastic finite-element static analyses of a lower premolar, constrained by a non-linearly elastic spring system representing the periodontal ligament, under several parafunctional loads. The influence of PCPs' number, material and dimensions is investigated by comparison of the resulting stress fields with those obtained in cases of traditional restorations (cast metal post and cemented single-PCP) and natural tooth, highlighting the advantages of the proposed technique when standard restorative materials are considered. A risk-analysis of root-fracture and interface-failure shows that cast <b>gold-alloy</b> post produces high stress concentrations at post-dentin interface, whereas multi-post solution leads to a behaviour closer to the natural tooth's, exhibiting some advantages with respect to single-PCP restorations. As a matter of fact, whenever PCPs' overall cross-section area increases, multi-post solution induces a significant reduction of stress levels into the residual dentin (and therefore the root-fracture-risk decreases) as well as of the expected polymerization shrinkage effects. Moreover, interfacial stress values in multi-post restorations can be higher than the single-PCP ones when carbon-fibre posts are considered. Nevertheless, the interfacial adhesive/cohesive failure-risk is certainly acceptable if glass-fibre posts are employed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the mechanical}} behaviour {{of a new}} reinforced anatomical post system (RAPS) for endodontic restoration. The composite restorative material (CRM) completely fills the root canal (as do the commonly-used cast metal posts) and multiple prefabricated composite posts (PCPs) are employed as reinforcements. Numerical simulations based on 3 D linearly elastic finite element models under parafunctional loads were performed in order to investigate {{the influence of the}} stiffness of the CRM and of the number of PCPs. Periodontal ligament effects were taken into account using a discretised anisotropic non-linearly elastic spring system, and the full discrete model was validated by comparing the resulting stress fields with those obtained with conventional restorations (cast <b>gold-alloy</b> post, homogeneous anatomical post, and cemented single PCP) and with the natural tooth. Analysis of the results shows that stresses at the cervical/middle region decrease as CRM stiffness increases and, for large and irregular root cavities, that apical stress peaks disappear when multiple PCPs are used. Accordingly, from a mechanical point of view, an optimal RAPS will use multiple PCPs when CRM stiffness is equal to or at most twice that of the dentin. This restorative solution minimises stress differences with respect to the natural tooth, mechanical inhomogeneities, stress concentrations on healthy tissues, volumes subject to shrinkage phenomena, fatigue effects, and risks of both root fracture and adhesive/cohesive interfacial failure...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{clinical}} study was to compare the internal gaps between abutment teeth and posterior fixed partial dentures (FPDs) fabricated utilizing milled zirconia and cast <b>gold-alloy</b> frameworks. As {{part of an ongoing}} randomized controlled clinical trial, 32 three-unit FPDs (16 zirconia and 16 metal-ceramic) in 25 patients were randomly selected for adaptation measurements. During the bisque-stage ceramic try-in, an A-silicone impression material was placed between the abutment teeth and the framework. The internal gap, corresponding to the thickness of the replica, was measured under magnification at the following locations: cervical, axial, and occlusal (cusp-tips and central). The internal gaps of FPDs with zirconia frameworks were significantly larger in cervical, axial, and centro-occlusal regions (cervical: 189. 6 +/- 71. 8 mum vs. 118. 6 +/- 31. 5 mum; axial: 140. 5 +/- 38. 3 mum vs. 95. 7 +/- 18. 1 mum; and centro-occlusal: 192. 0 +/- 66. 5 mum vs. 153. 1 +/- 69. 8 mum). The cervical gaps next to the pontics were significantly larger compared with those of the outer walls in both types of FPDs (zirconia: mean difference 67. 7 +/- 114. 7 mum; metal-ceramic: mean difference 30. 0 +/- 71. 2 mum). Posterior three-unit FPDs incorporating milled zirconia frameworks exhibited larger internal gaps than those constructed using conventional metal-ceramic techniques...|$|R
40|$|Objective The {{introduction}} of yttrium-stabilized zirconia (Y-TZP) has opened new frontiers {{in the fields}} of dental-material esthetics and biocompatibility. In a previous report, we analyzed the capacity of Y-TZP to withstand maximum loading (static resistance) and the repeated application of loads lesser than those that provoke fracture (fatigue resistance). The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the adhesion between Y-TZP and its ceramic support (shear resistance). Materials and methods To assess this characteristic, we developed a new testing protocol to be used with specially designed cylindrical samples with ceramic covering on a zirconia base. The research was carried out in two phases: the aim of the first was to identify the approach that produced the best adhesion; the second phase aimed at identifying the mechanical and/or physical mechanisms responsible for the zirconia/ceramic adhesion. Results In the first phase, we found that the surface finish of the zirconia was the sole factor that influenced final adhesion. In the second phase, our findings showed that this adhesion is essentially due to micromechanical and physical interactions, which were not dependent on the contact pressure between the two materials or on the geometric characteristics of the ceramic covering. Conclusions On the whole, the best final result was obtained when the zirconia was subjected to surface finishing with a diamond rotary instrument, but even in this case adhesion was inferior to that achieved with a <b>gold-alloy</b> base...|$|R
5000|$|The Tumi is a Peruvian {{sacrificial}} ceremonial axe, or knife {{as it is}} {{most commonly}} referred to, distinctly characterized by a semi-circular blade, made of either bronze, copper, <b>gold-alloy,</b> wood, or silver alloy and is often inlayed with semi-precious stones such as lapis lazuli. Tumis are most often associated with Pre-Inca cultures in the Peruvian Coastal Region {{and in some cases}} with the Inca culture itself. The most common examples of the tumi are associated with the Peruvian cultures of the Chimor (also referred to as the Chimu, which represents the style of art from this culture), ad the Lambayeque (also known as the Sipan or Sican). In Andean mythology, the Moche, Chimu and Incas were descendants of the Sun God, Inti, who was worshiped annually with an extravagant celebration known as the Inti Raymi, which is still alluded to today {{in the form of the}} Inti Raymi Festival. The festival took place at the end of the potato and maize harvest in order to thank the Sun for the abundant crops or to ask for better crops during the next season. During this important religious ceremony, the High Priest would sacrifice a completely black or white llama. Using a tumi, he would open the animal's chest and with his hands pull out its throbbing heart, lungs and viscera, so that observing those elements he could foretell the future. Later, the animal and its parts were completely incinerated.|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} the survival rate of immediately loaded, acidetched implants (Osseotites) in the edentulous maxilla {{over a period}} of 12 months. Materials and methods: Sixteen patients (mean age 59 years) with residual compromised maxillary teeth were made edentulous and rehabilitated with a screw-retained fixed provisional prosthesis with a <b>gold-alloy</b> framework and composite teeth in 24 h after surgery supported by a minimum of four implants to a maximum of six ones. To obtain the highest primary stability in all post-extractive sockets tapered implants were used whereas in parental bone cylindrical implants were inserted. After a mean healing time of 18 weeks, a definitive prosthesis was carried out. A total of 89 implants were analyzed. All patients were maintained in a regular recall program. Radiological examinations were made at implant placement, at definitive prosthesis delivery and at 12 months. Results: At 12 months follow-up the implants survival rate was 92. 2 % whereas the prostheses survival rate was 100 %. No statistical difference was found between the survival of implants placed in post-extractive sockets and those in parental bone and between cylindrical and tapered implants. Seven implants failed during the first 3 months. Seventy one percent of lost implants were in distal areas. The mean reduction in marginal bone was 1. 3 mm. Conclusions: According to a severe surgical and prosthetic protocol, four to six implants seem to be enough to support an edentulous maxilla implant fixed rehabilitation.

40|$|Soft tissue {{integration}} {{is a prerequisite}} for implant success. The role of the soft tissue barrier at implants is to provide an effective seal that protects the underlying bone and prevents access for microorganisms and their products. The objectives of the present series of experimental studies were to examine the morphogenesis of the mucosal attachment to titanium implants (study 1) and healing to titanium implants coated with type I collagen (study 2) and to implant abutments made of different materials (study 3). Healing around two-part implants placed in a subcrestal position (study 4) and in sites with buccal bone defects (study 5) was also studied. The dog model was used in all experiments. Following extraction of premolars implants that represented different implant systems were placed in the edentulous premolar regions. After varying periods of healing block biopsies were collected and prepared for histological examination. It was demonstrated that the formation of a barrier epithelium was initiated after 1 - 2 weeks of healing and completed at 6 - 8 weeks after surgery. The collagen fibers in the connective tissue became organized after 4 - 6 weeks of healing. The findings indicated that the overall dimension of the soft tissue interface to titanium, i. e. “biological width” was established after 6 weeks following surgery (study 1). Similar soft tissue dimensions and composition of the connective tissue were found at collagen coated and un-coated titanium implants after 4 and 8 weeks of healing (study 2). Abutments made of titanium and zirconia promoted proper conditions for soft tissue integration, while abutments made of <b>gold-alloy</b> failed to establish appropriate soft tissue integration (study 3) Bone formation coronal of the junction between the implant and the abutment was possible when 2 -part implants with sufficient surface characteristics were placed in a subcrestal position. The connective tissue interface to abutments with a TiOblast surface was comprised of a higher density of collagen and a lower fraction of fibroblasts than at abutments with a turned surface (Study 4). Different marginal bone levels at the lingual and buccal aspects were obtained when 2 -part implants with suitable surface characteristics were placed in sites with buccal bone defects (Study 5) ...|$|R
40|$|On {{the north}} coast of present-day Peru, between the Andes and the Pacific Ocean, prospered {{approximately}} between 1000 BC and 1375 AD, several relevant cultures: Chavín (1000 - 200 BC), Vicús and Frías (200 BC - 300 AD), Moche (400 BC- 700 AD), Sicán (700 - 1375 AD). These cultures are interconnected and characterized by a high metallurgical ability, demonstrated {{by the presence of}} beautiful artifacts on gold, silver and copper alloys. More than hundred metal artefacts from these cultures were analyzed with a portable equipment which uses the non-destructive and non-invasive technique of energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF). Following objects were analyzed: (1) gold, silver and copper objects from the Chavín culture (Museo Municipal of Piura and and Museo Enrico Poli in Lima); (2) gold and silver objects from the Vicús and Frías cultures (Museo Municipal of Piura); (3) gold, silver and copper objects from the Moche culture (“Museo Tumbas Reales de Sipán”, “Museo de Sitio de Huaca Rajada” in Lambayeque and Museo Enrico Poli in Lima); (4) gold, silver and copper objects from the Sicán culture (Museum of Sicán, Ferrañafe). Portable equipments were employed, mainly composed of a small size X-ray tube and a thermoelectrically cooled, small size, Si-PIN or Si-drift X-ray detectors. The main characteristics of the EDXRF-technique is of being non destructive and multi-elemental. Standard samples of gold and silver alloys were employed for calibration and quantitative analysis. The aims of this campaign of analysis were: (1) to analyze a large number of objects; (2) to differentiate gold, gilded copper and tumbaga (this last being a poor gold alloy enriched at the surface by depletion gilding); (3) to correlate, when possible, composition of analyzed alloys to the specific culture; (4) to determine a possible evolution of metallurgy; (5) to better determine characteristics and beginning time of tumbaga production. It was determined that the analyzed artefacts are composed of gold, silver and copper alloys, of gilded copper or silver and tumbaga, the last being a poor <b>gold-alloy</b> rich on copper and enriched at the surface by depletion gilding, i. e. by removing copper from the surface. About 120 alloys were analyzed. In the case of gold, silver and copper alloys, their composition was determined by EDXRF-analysis by employing standard alloys. In the case of gilded copper (or gilded silver) and of copper based tumbaga, the ratios Cu(Kα/Kβ) andAu(Lα/Lβ) were determined from the X-ray spectra, first to clearly differentiate gold, gilded metal and tumbaga, and then to determine the gilding thickness. Concerning the correlation composition-culture, it seems that the Chavín did not use to mix copper in the gold alloy. This element, with a mean concentration of 1. 5...|$|R
