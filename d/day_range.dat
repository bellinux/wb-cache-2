25|$|Phytosterols {{are widely}} {{recognized}} as having a proven LDL cholesterol lowering efficacy. Current supplemental guidelines recommend doses of phytosterols in the 1.6-3.0grams per <b>day</b> <b>range</b> (Health Canada, EFSA, ATP III, FDA) with a recent meta-analysis demonstrating an 8.8% reduction in LDL-cholesterol at a mean dose of 2.15gram per day.

25|$|From a dietary perspective, plant cells do not {{manufacture}} cholesterol, {{and it is}} {{not found}} in plant foods. Some plant foods, such as avocado, flax seeds and peanuts, contain phytosterols, which compete with cholesterol for absorption in the intestines, reducing the absorption of both dietary and bile cholesterol. However, a typical diet contributes on the order of 0.2 grams of phytosterols, which is not enough to {{have a significant impact on}} blocking cholesterol absorption. Phytosterols intake can be supplemented through the use of phytosterol-containing functional foods or dietary supplements that are recognized as having potential to reduce levels of LDL-cholesterol.

25|$|Since its discovery, vitamin C {{has been}} {{considered}} almost a panacea by some, although this led to suspicions of it being overhyped by others. Vitamin C has been promoted in alternative medicine {{as a treatment for}} the common cold, cancer, polio and various other illnesses. The evidence for these claims is mixed. Orthomolecular-based megadose recommendations for vitamin C are based mainly on theoretical speculation and observational studies, such as those published by Fred R. Klenner from the 1940s through the 1970s. There is a strong advocacy movement for such doses of vitamin C, and there is an absence of large scale, formal trials in the 10 to 200+ grams per <b>day</b> <b>range.</b> The single repeatable side effect of oral megadose vitamin C is a mild laxative effect if the practitioner attempts to consume too much too quickly. A tolerable upper limit (UL) of vitamin C was set at 2grams {{for the first time in}} the year 2000, referencing this mild laxative effect as the reason for establishing the UL.|$|E

50|$|The present <b>day</b> <b>range</b> of Ascinara is {{much less}} than {{what it used to}} be, as a result of both climatic changes and {{increased}} competition. In New Zealand in particular, the range of A. lucida has decreased.

A. lucida grew reliably in regions of approximately 1500mm rainfall, and abundantly in areas of approximately 2500mm rainfall.

40|$|The {{reliability}} of MYCO/F Lytic medium in the BACTEC 9240 blood culture system was evaluated by comparing its performance {{to that of}} the Isolator system for the recovery of fungi and {{to that of the}} ESP II system for the recovery of mycobacteria. Of 717 specimens of blood cultured for fungi, 24 were positive; 12 samples were positive with both systems, 7 samples were positive with the Isolator system only, and 5 samples were positive with MYCO/F Lytic medium only. Fourteen samples grew Histoplasma capsulatum; both systems detected H. capsulatum in seven samples but the Isolator system alone detected H. capsulatum in seven samples. The mean times to the detection of H. capsulatum were 8 <b>days</b> (<b>range,</b> 4 to 13 days) for MYCO/F Lytic medium and 9 <b>days</b> (<b>range,</b> 6 to 18 days) for the Isolator system; the mean times to identification were 20 <b>days</b> (<b>range,</b> 15 to 24 days) for isolates recovered with MYCO/F Lytic medium and 11 <b>days</b> (<b>range,</b> 6 to 18 days) for those recovered with the Isolator system (P < 0. 05). Cryptococcus neoformans was isolated from 10 fungal cultures; five isolates grew in both systems, and five isolates grew in MYCO/F Lytic medium only. The mean times to detection of C. neoformans were 4 <b>days</b> (<b>range,</b> 2 to 6 days) for MYCO/F Lytic medium and 7 <b>days</b> (<b>range,</b> 5 to 7 days) for the Isolator system (P < 0. 05); the mean times to identification were 15 <b>days</b> (<b>range,</b> 7 to 27 days) for isolates recovered with MYCO/F Lytic medium and 8 <b>days</b> (<b>range,</b> 7 to 11 days) for those recovered with the Isolator system. Of the 687 samples of blood cultured for mycobacteria, 64 blood samples from 42 patients grew mycobacteria (58 grew Mycobacterium avium complex, 4 grew Mycobacterium kansasii, and 2 grew Mycobacterium tuberculosis); 42 isolates were recovered with both systems, 18 were isolated with MYCO/F medium only, and 4 were isolated with the ESP II system only alone (P < 0. 05). The mean time to detection of mycobacteria with MYCO/F Lytic medium was 14 days, whereas it was 17 days with the ESP II system (P < 0. 05). In summary, the combination of MYCO/F Lytic medium and the BACTEC 9240 instrument is an excellent blood culture system for the growth and detection of mycobacteria.

40|$|ObjectiveThis study {{assessed}} {{the outcome of}} vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) as primary therapy for exposed prosthetic vascular grafts in the groin (Szilagyi III). MethodsThe study included all consecutive patients with Szilagyi III groin infections and exposed prosthetic graft material from 2009 to 2011. After initial wound debridement, VAC was applied using a two-layer combination, consisting of polyvinyl alcohol and polyurethane sponges. Continuous negative pressure was set on a maximum of 50 mm Hg. All patients received complementary antibiotic therapy. The primary end point was defined as complete wound closure. Secondary end points comprised bleeding complications, amputation, and death. ResultsThe study evaluated 15 patients with 17 Szilagyi III groin infections. Mean total length of VAC therapy was 43 <b>days</b> (<b>range,</b> 14 - 76 days). Mean time until complete healing was 51 <b>days</b> (<b>range,</b> 24 - 82 days). Mean length of VAC therapy in the hospital was 21 <b>days</b> (<b>range,</b> 5 - 61 days). Eleven patients received continued VAC treatment at home for a mean length of 22 <b>days</b> (<b>range,</b> 5 - 69 days). Complete healing was achieved in 14 groins (82 %). Three failures due to persisting infection, persisting necrosis, and a pseudomonas infection were noted. No bleeding complications, amputations, or late reinfections occurred. Median follow-up was 380 <b>days</b> (<b>range,</b> 56 - 939 days). Despite therapy failure, all 17 grafts were preserved.
