5|$|Hip {{dysplasia}} is an abnormality of the <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> {{which can}} cause crippling lameness and arthritis. The cats most commonly affected with hip dysplasia tend to be males of the larger, big-boned breeds such as Persians and Maine Coons. The relatively smaller size and weight of cats frequently results in symptoms that are less pronounced. X-rays submitted to the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) between 1974 and 2011 indicates that 24.3% of Maine Coons in the database were dysplastic. The Maine Coon is the only cat breed listed in the database.|$|E
5|$|Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, {{also called}} Avascular Necrosis of the Femoral Head, {{is where the}} ball section of the femur in the <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> deteriorates {{following}} interruption of the blood flow and is the same condition as in humans. In dogs, this causes lameness of the hind-legs, the thigh muscles to atrophy and pain in the joint. It usually occurs between 6–12 months of age and has been documented {{in a variety of}} other terrier breeds including the Border terrier, Lakeland terrier, and Wheaten terrier.|$|E
5|$|The breed is {{generally}} healthy {{with an average}} life span of 12 to 15 years. Hip dysplasia, a genetic malformation of the <b>hip</b> <b>joint,</b> may be a concern {{but because of the}} breed's compact nature is not often seriously debilitating. Surveys conducted by the Orthopedic Foundation For Animals showed that 41.5% of Sussex Spaniels were affected by hip dysplasia, and the breed was ranked 9th worst affected out of 157 breeds.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Theoretical {{studies of}} fluid-film {{lubrication}} in artificial <b>hip</b> <b>joints</b> are reviewed. The importance of developing effective numerical tools to solve realistic and complex lubrication problems in artificial <b>hip</b> <b>joints</b> has been emphasized. The elastic deformation of the bearing surfaces {{has been shown}} to play a dominant role in promoting elastohydrodynamic lubrication in various forms of artificial <b>hip</b> <b>joints</b> using different bearing surfaces. Both the bearing geome-try and the structural supports can {{have a significant effect on}} the predicted lubricant film thick-ness. The importance of elastic deformation is further enhanced synergistically with the transient variation in load and speed to ensure a maximum effectiveness of the transient elas-tohydrodynamic lubricationmechanism in artificial <b>hip</b> <b>joints.</b> The recent application of the fast Fourier transform technique, in conjunction with the finite-element method to calculate the elastic deformation, not only enables more complex structural supports to the acetabular cup to be considered, but also offers the potential of analysing both transient and mixed lubrication problems in artificial <b>hip</b> <b>joints...</b>|$|R
40|$|Summary The aim of {{the study}} is the {{substantiation}} of movement regimen for children with JCA and damage of <b>hip</b> <b>joints.</b> 20 patients with prevalent <b>hip</b> <b>joints</b> damages in clinical picture were examined. Clinical, laboratory, anthropometric methods and U-sound diagnostics were used. Basing on the analysis of anamnestic, clinical data and U-sound examination the regimen of loads for patients with <b>hip</b> <b>joints</b> damage was substantiated. Method of Junctional treatment was suggested including the treatment by position, exercise therapy in combination with gradually increasing regimen of locomotive loads, its efficacy was assessed...|$|R

5|$|The hominid Australopithecus afarensis {{represents}} an evolutionary transition between modern bipedal humans and their quadrupedal ape ancestors. A number of traits of the A. afarensis skeleton strongly reflect bipedalism, {{to the extent}} that some researchers have suggested that bipedality evolved long before A. afarensis. In overall anatomy, the pelvis is far more human-like than ape-like. The iliac blades are short and wide, the sacrum is wide and positioned directly behind the <b>hip</b> <b>joint,</b> and there is clear evidence of a strong attachment for the knee extensors, implying an upright posture.|$|E
5|$|Other {{less common}} {{conditions}} which {{appear in the}} breed include hydroxyglutaric aciduria, which is where elevated levels of Alpha-Hydroxyglutaric acid are in the dog's urine, blood plasma, and spinal fluid. It can cause seizures, muscle stiffness, and ataxia, but is more commonly found in Staffordshire Bull Terriers. A degeneration of the <b>hip</b> <b>joint,</b> known as Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, also occurs in the breed. However, the chances of this condition occurring are much higher in some other breeds, such as the Australian Shepherd and the Miniature Pincher. The breed {{is also one of}} the least likely to be affected by a luxating patella, where the knee cap slips out of place.|$|E
5|$|Kidney {{and heart}} {{diseases}} {{have been reported}} in the breed. In an experiment directed by John C. Fyfea, Rebeccah L. Kurzhals, and others, it was concluded that a complex rearrangement in the breed's Glycogen branching enzyme (GBE1) can cause both a perinatal hypoglycemic collapse and a late-juvenile-onset neuromuscular degeneration in glycogen storage disease type IV in the breed. This disorder, while rare, can prove fatal to cats that have it. There are DNA tests available for GSD IV, and it is highly recommended (some cat associations obligate their Norwegian Forest cat breeder members) to carry out the DNA test before using such animals for breeding. PawPeds provide a pedigree database which comes together with health programmes, through publishing each single cat's test result, to provide useful information for breeders to make a well-informed breeding decision. The breed has also been known to suffer from hip dysplasia, which is a rare, partially hereditary disease of the <b>hip</b> <b>joint.</b>|$|E

5|$|Various {{distinguishing}} {{traits of}} the lower jaw have been established. The longitudinal groove on the outer surface of the dentary is wide. The third tooth socket of the dentary is not enlarged. Seen from above, the dentary is straight without an expanded jaw tip. The interdental plates, reinforcing the teeth from behind, {{of the lower}} jaw are tall. Benson also concluded it would be most parsimonious {{to assume that the}} Stonesfield Slate material represents a single species. If so, several additional distinctive traits can be observed {{in other parts of the}} skeleton. The low vertical ridge on the outer side of the ilium, above the <b>hip</b> <b>joint,</b> shows parallel vertical grooves. The bony skirts between the shafts of the ischia are thick and touch each other forming an almost flat surface. There is a boss present on the lower outer side of the ischium shaft with a rough surface. The underside of the second sacral vertebra has an angular longitudinal keel. A ridge on the upper side of the third metatarsal connected to a groove in the side of the second metatarsal. The middle of the front edge of the scapula forms a thin crest.|$|E

30|$|Another fact to {{be taken}} into {{consideration}} is that the number of 1 -day admission births, home births, and births in private clinics not providing orthopaedic service, is increasing. It also has to be noted that routine sonographic examinations at birth might deliver doubtful results, such as immature-looking hips that usually resolve spontaneously within the first weeks of life. The prevalence of Graf type IIa hips in neonates is approximately 20  %, which bears a potential risk for overtreatment [26]. <b>Hip</b> <b>joints</b> that are classified as type IIa look like dysplastic <b>hip</b> <b>joints</b> but are normal at that age. It is known that at 12  weeks after birth, only 11  % of former type IIa <b>hip</b> <b>joints</b> remain, being classified as type IIb from that time on [31].|$|R
25|$|In {{the normal}} {{anatomy of the}} <b>hip</b> <b>joint,</b> the root (the thigh bone) is {{connected}} to the pelvis at the <b>hip</b> <b>joint.</b> The almost spherical end of the femur head (the caput, or caput ossis femoris) fits into the acetabulum (a concave socket located in the pelvis). The bony surfaces of the femur head and of the acetabulum are covered by cartilage. While bones provide the strength necessary to support body weight, cartilage ensures a smooth fit and a wide range of motion. Normal hip function can be affected by congenital conditions such as dysplasia, discussed in this article, trauma, and by acquired diseases such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
25|$|Transient {{synovitis}} is {{a diagnosis}} of exclusion. The diagnosis {{can be made in}} the typical setting of pain or limp in a young child who is not generally unwell and has no recent trauma. There is a limited range of motion of the <b>hip</b> <b>joint.</b> Blood tests may show mild inflammation. An ultrasound scan of the <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> can show a fluid collection (effusion). Treatment is with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and limited weight-bearing. The condition usually clears by itself within seven to ten days, but a small group of patients will continue to have symptoms for several weeks. The recurrence rate is 4–17%, most of which is in the first six months.|$|E
25|$|Hip {{dysplasia}} is a heritable condition {{where the}} femur {{does not fit}} securely in the pelvic socket of the <b>hip</b> <b>joint.</b> This problem can exist with or without clinical signs, meaning some dogs feel pain in one or both rear legs.|$|E
50|$|Other {{clinical}} features often include scoliosis, short fifth finger, persistence of fingerpads, and X-ray abnormalities of the vertebrae, hands, and <b>hip</b> <b>joints.</b>|$|R
40|$|Case Report A 19 {{years old}} young lady {{reported}} {{to us with}} the complaints of low backache for last 6 years. Pain usually aggravated by walking and partially subsided by taking analgesic. For last 2 years she also developed occasional pain in her both knee on walking, without any swelling or redness. From very childhood she also had limping gait. Clinical examination revealed {{the presence of a}} limping or Trendelenburg gait and wasting of both quadriceps muscles. His range of movement in both <b>hip</b> <b>joints</b> in all direction was restricted, which was more pronounced during internal and abduction of both <b>hip</b> <b>joints.</b> All other systemic examination revealed normal findings. The X-ray of the pelvis with both <b>hip</b> <b>joints</b> showed both the femoral head was deformed with short neck, irregular articular erosion with sub articular sclerosis in the both acetabulam and femoral head. Joint spaces were reduced. All features correlate with Perthes disease. Whole body scintigraphy showed increased radiotracer uptake in both <b>hip</b> <b>joints</b> and spines. With all of these findings she was diagnosed as a case of Legg-Calve-Perthes disease and referred to orthopaedic centre for better management...|$|R

25|$|If {{medications}} fail {{to maintain}} an adequate quality of life, surgical options {{may need to be}} considered. These may attempt to modify or repair the <b>hip</b> <b>joint,</b> in order to allow pain-free usage, or may in some cases completely replace it.|$|E
25|$|As early human {{ancestors}} {{evolved into}} bipeds, changes {{occurred in the}} pelvis, <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> and spine which increased the risk of osteoarthritis. Additionally genetic variations that increase the risk were likely not selected against because usually problems only occur after reproductive success.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{standardized}} systems for categorising dysplasia, set out by respective reputable bodies (Orthopedic Foundation for Animals/OFA, PennHIP, British Veterinary Association/BVA).

40|$|A {{literature}} search revealed that for over 100 years {{there has been}} a consensus that the ligament of the head of the femur (LHF) is absent in the orangutan and elephant. A dissection of the <b>hip</b> <b>joints</b> of an adult orangutan and an adult Indian elephant exposed, in each joint, a robust LHF that is functionally important. These LHFs are easily overlooked during a cursory examination of the <b>hip</b> <b>joints</b> {{because of the way they}} differ from the human LHF...|$|R
30|$|According to Figure  4, it can {{be found}} that the walking speed of the {{heavy-duty}} six-legged robot depends on the <b>hip</b> <b>joints</b> and knee joints of leg 2 and leg 5, not on their abductor joints. When the actuating devices are confirmed and need to provide large torque, the <b>hip</b> <b>joints</b> and knee joints of leg 2 and leg 5 limits the walking speed of the robot. Hence, the mixture-type II walking mode is better than the mixture-type I walking mode in the aspect of walking speed.|$|R
25|$|The Lauenstein {{projection}} {{a form of}} {{examination of}} the <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> emphasizing {{the relationship of the}} femur to the acetabulum. The knee of the affected leg is flexed, and the thigh is drawn up to nearly a right angle. This is also called the frog-leg position.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, surface {{replacement}} of joints, {{in particular the}} <b>hip</b> <b>joint,</b> have become more popular amongst younger and more active patients. This type of operation delays {{the need for the}} more traditional and less bone-conserving total hip replacement, but carries significant risks of early failure from fracture and bone death.|$|E
25|$|The {{ichthyosaur}} pelvis {{is typically}} rather reduced. The three pelvic bones: the ilium, the ischium, and the pubic bone, are not fused and {{often do not}} even touch each other. Also, {{the left and right}} pelvic sides do not longer touch; only basal forms still have sacral ribs connecting the ilia to the vertebral column. The <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> is not closed on the inside. The pubic bone typically does not connect to the ischium behind it; the space in between is by some workers identified as the fenestra thyreoidea; other researchers deny that the term is applicable given the general loose structure of the pelvis. Some later species have a connected pubic bone and ischium, but in this case, the femoral head no longer articulates with the <b>hip</b> <b>joint.</b> Triassic species have plate-like pubic bones and ischia; in later species these elements become elongated with a narrow shaft and can form a single rod.|$|E
