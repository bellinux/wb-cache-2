Although it is frequently found in American lobsters, the disease has only been seen in captive H.gammarus, where prior occupation of the tanks by H.americanus could not be ruled out.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Gaffkaemia</b> {{was first}} {{discovered}} in 1947 in American lobsters (Homarus americanus) {{in a holding}} tank in Maine. It was originally described as [...] "Gaffkya homari" [...] by Hitcher and Snieszko, but the genus name Gaffkya was rejected in 1971, and the <b>gaffkaemia</b> bacterium was recognised as a subspecies or variety of Aerococcus viridans by Kelly and Evans in 1974.|$|E
50|$|The Aerococcaceae are {{a family}} of Gram-positive lactic acid bacteria, {{including}} the bacterium that causes <b>gaffkaemia</b> in lobsters.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gaffkaemia</b> (gaffkemia in American English) is a {{bacterial}} disease of lobsters, {{caused by the}} Gram-positive lactic acid bacterium Aerococcus viridans var. homari.|$|E
50|$|The {{effects of}} <b>gaffkaemia</b> {{infection}} include lethargy (typically {{seen as a}} drooping tail), anorexia and a pink colour on the ventral side of the abdomen, which gives the disease its alternative common name of red tail disease. When lobsters are moribund, they may lie on their sides, and frequently lose appendages. The effects of <b>gaffkaemia</b> are slowed by low temperatures, such that death can occur within two days of infection at 20 C, but can take over 60 days at 3 C.|$|E

50|$|Aerococcus viridans is {{a member}} of the {{bacterial}} genus Aerococcus. It is a causative agent of <b>gaffkaemia,</b> a disease of lobsters, and is used as a commercial source for lactate oxidase.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gaffkaemia</b> is {{enzootic}} in North America, {{and causes}} little harm to wild populations of H. americanus. In the European or common lobster, Homarus gammarus, however, {{it is far}} more destructive. European lobsters held in the same tanks as American lobsters can be killed within days. A number of other crustacean species can be infected with A. v. var. homari, but do not develop severe disease. They include the shrimp Pandalus platyceros, and the crabs Cancer borealis, Cancer irroratus, Metacarcinus magister, Libinia emarginata, Chionoecetes opilio and Chaceon quinquedens. Spiny lobsters appear to be either immune or resistant to <b>gaffkaemia.</b>|$|E

50|$|The primary {{method for}} {{controlling}} {{the incidence of}} <b>gaffkaemia</b> is improved hygiene. Other measures include limiting damage to the exoskeleton (preventing the bacterium's entry), reducing the water temperature, and reducing the stocking density. Antibiotics may be effective against the bacterium, but only tetracycline is currently approved by the U.S Food and Drug Administration for use in American lobsters.|$|E

40|$|<b>Gaffkaemia,</b> {{caused by}} Aerococcus viridans var. homari, causes fatal infections in Homarus spp. (clawed lobsters). Despite its high {{economic}} {{significance to the}} lobster fisheries in the USA and northern Europe, data on its prevalence in captured and wild populations, particularly in Europe, is scarce. Following an outbreak of <b>gaffkaemia</b> in a European lobster holding facility in South Wales (UK), a base-line survey was conducted for <b>gaffkaemia</b> in wild populations of European lobster Homarus gammarus around the coast of England and Wales. In addition, isolates recovered from the original outbreak and the survey were typed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and compared with previously characterised isolates from the USA, UK and Canada. Locally caught H. gammarus were sampled at 30 sites from around the coast of England and Wales between March 2006 and October 2008. Results confirmed that the prevalence of <b>gaffkaemia</b> in populations of H. gammarus was low, with only 9 positive isolates recovered from 952 samples examined. PFGE analysis showed that the isolates from the outbreak investigation shared the same pulsotype as A. viridans var. homari isolates from the USA, Norway and Canada, {{as well as an}} isolate (NCIMB 1119) reportedly recovered from an outbreak of European lobsters in England in the 1960 s. This confirms earlier studies that suggest virulent strains of A. viridans var. homari show very limited geographical or temporal genetic variation and were introduced into the UK with American lobsters H. americanus...|$|E
40|$|Marine {{conservation}} zones (MCZs) are a form {{of spatial}} marine management, increasingly popular since the move towards ecosystem-based fisheries management. Implementation, however, is somewhat contentious {{and as a result}} of their short history, their effects are still widely unknown and understudied. Here, we investigate the population and health of the European lobster (Homarus gammarus) in the Lundy Island Marine Conservation Zone, Bristol Channel, UK. Using the fished refuge zone (RZ) as a control area, catch per unit effort was calculated for both the no-take zone (NTZ) and RZ and binomial logistic regression models were used to examine the effects of site, sex, landing size, and loss of chelae on the probability of shell disease and injury presence in individuals. Lobsters were also tested for the causative agent of <b>gaffkaemia,</b> Aerococcus viridans var. homari, and white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). The analysis revealed a higher lobster density and larger lobsters in the NTZ compared with the RZ. Shell disease was present in 24 % of lobsters and the probability of shell disease occurrence increased notably for individuals over the minimum landing size (MLS) of 90 mm carapace length. Shell disease was also more prevalent in lobsters displaying injury, and in males. Injury was present in 33 % of lobsters sampled and prevalence was higher in lobsters in the NTZ compared with the RZ, and in lobsters >MLS. Aerococcus viridans var. homari was detected in < 1 % of individuals, but WSSV was absent from all sampled lobsters. Overall, the study demonstrates both positive and potentially negative effects of NTZs, methods for effective non-lethal sampling of disease agents, and highlights the need for more comprehensive, long-term monitoring within highly protected MCZs, both before and after implementation...|$|E
