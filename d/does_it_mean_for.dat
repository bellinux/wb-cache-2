In this thesis we try to answer how two groups of people looked at the changes in their society in their time. For this purpose we first follow two writers, Charles Dickens and Elisabeth Gaskell, as they develop their view on the social consequences of the Industrial Revolution. Next, we follow the scientists William Thompson, who became baron Kelvin of Largs, as he develops his new technical progressions. Finally these two views are combined to form {{a part of the}} answer of what the Industrial Revolution meant for those living in that era...|$|R

40|$|Sustainability is an {{important}} concept currently {{at the forefront of}} many policy agendas. Yet, the science of sustainability is still inchoate: What <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>for</b> a system to be sustainable? What are the features of sustainable systems and how can they be quantified? The systems we deal with - ecological, economic, social, and integrated - are complex and operate by maintaining functional gradients away from equilibrium. While there are basic requirements regarding availability of input and output boundary flows and sinks, sustainability is centrally a feature of system configuration. A system must provide a basis of positionally-balancing, wholeness-enhancing centers of activity. One aspect of this system balance is between efficiency and redundancy which can be measured in ecological and economic systems using information-based network analysis. Specifically, the robustness indicator as developed by Robert Ulanowicz and colleagues offers deep insight into the structure and function of these self-sustaining autocatalytic configurations (through constant flows of energy and matter). In this paper, I overview these concepts and methods and provide examples from economic and ecological systems and discuss the meaning of the differences in outcome...|$|R

40|$|Sustainability is an {{important}} concept, currently {{at the forefront of}} many policy agendas. Yet, the science of sustainability is still inchoate: What <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>for</b> a system to be sustainable? What are the features of sustainable systems and how can they be quantified? Systems ecology is built on Bertalanffy’s premise that organisms, like all complex adaptive systems, are self-organized and interactive. This shifted our perspective from a linear mechanism to models that required a broader, holistic orientation in order to understand fully the dynamics involved. These complex systems operate by maintaining functional gradients away from equilibrium. While there are basic requirements regarding availability of input and output boundary flows and sinks, sustainability is centrally a feature of system configuration. A system must provide a basis of positionally balancing, wholeness-enhancing centers of activity. In this presentation, I provide an overview of concepts and methods developed in ecosystem theory to describe the structure and function of these self-sustaining autocatalytic configurations, and extend the methods to applications in economic and socio-economic systems...|$|R

The study is {{the first of its kind}} to integrate both an 'ethnographically inspired' approach, which takes into account a longitudinal perspective of the participants and the community that forms between them, as well as a discourse pragmatic analysis of classroom discourse among the multilingual participants. The study then attempts to grapple with the three following real-world questions about the role of language in education: 1. What <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>for</b> participants in HE to be using English as a lingua franca (ELF) in terms of talk, participation and culture? 2. How does the nature of language use and how do the participants in the programme change over time? 3. What impact might the use of ELF as classroom language have on teaching and learning? These are questions that are in great need of grappling with as English plays an ever more important role in HE programmes around the world, and where classrooms are increasingly multilingual...|$|R

40|$|This is a delightfully subversive {{take on the}} {{traditional}} Oxford college history. Neither a cosy anecdotal inside story, nor a straightforward account of women's struggle to enter the university, this history of St Hugh's College, Oxford looks both upstairs and downstairs, at dons and undergraduates but also at domestic staff. What <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>for</b> the would-be school teacher, the flapper on the motorcycle, the depression era grammar-school girl, and the student revolutionary of the 1970 s to re-invent themselves as educated women? Who remained excluded from this emancipated identity? What were the tensions between old and new generations of dons and undergraduates? And what of the first Principal's notorious belief in time-travel? In this innovative study, Schwartz explores the relationship between personal and collective identity {{in one of the}} first higher educational establishments run by and for women, during a period in which women's role both in society and university education changed beyond recognition. Based on new and original research, "A Serious Endeavour" offers a fresh and sometimes disquieting perspective on the history of gender and education in twentieth-century Britain, opening up new ways of thinking about the development of women's higher education...|$|R

40|$|What <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>for</b> local {{residents}} to account publicly for olfactory nuisances in their environment, {{to share their}} experiences, and, above all, to render objectivable what could appear, at first glance, as sheer subjectivities? Relying on an Actor-Network Theory (ANT) approach to technical democracy, a Belgian case study where knowledge co-production between citizens, university, and a spin-off enterprise is described and debated. Between the odor emission source (industry, waste disposal,…) and the odor immission realities (reception) there are an heterogeneity of both natural and social factors that render the flux of odorous molecules more or less challenging to trace. This story is about both technical and social traceabilities. This story is about the intimate, but problematic, relations between electronic noses and human lookouts (Vigies), where the identity of impacted residents and the aerial characteristics of the odors are closely related. The very intimate (recalcitrant) trajectories of air causes interesting mode of associations between key protagonists: {{a change in the}} protocol of measurements and it’s the nature of the relations between them that is transformed. In terms of governance, the direct involvement of citizens in the odor monitoring in direct collaboration with the industry (odor source) offers a kind of “management of proximity” that contrasts with the more classic mode of regulation by public authorities.

Environmental stewardship is typically thought of as entailing reducing human impacts into the natural world.
