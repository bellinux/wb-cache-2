5|$|Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, {{like all}} dinucleotides, {{consists}} of two nucleosides joined {{by a pair of}} bridging phosphate groups. The nucleosides each contain a ribose ring, one with adenine attached to the first carbon atom (the 1' position) and the other with nicotinamide at this position. The nicotinamide moiety can be attached in two orientations to this anomeric carbon atom. Because of these two possible structures, the compound exists as two diastereomers. It is the β-nicotinamide <b>diastereomer</b> of NAD that is found in organisms. These nucleotides are joined together by a bridge of two phosphate groups through the 5' carbons.|$|E

Due to the superiority of mass spectrometry (MS) over other analytical methods in terms of speed, specificity and sensitivity, chiral analysis by MS has attracted much interest in recent years. Chiral analysis by MS typically involves introduction of a chiral selector to form <b>diastereomers</b> with analyte enantiomers, and comparison of the behaviors of <b>diastereomers</b> in MS.

25|$|The {{major cause}} of benzene in soft drinks is the {{decarboxylation}} of benzoic acid {{in the presence of}} ascorbic acid (vitamin C, E300) or erythorbic acid (a <b>diastereomer</b> of ascorbic acid, E315).

25|$|Isomerism caused much consternation {{to early}} researchers, since isomers have {{exactly the same}} composition, but differ in {{configuration}} (arrangement) of the atoms. For example, there was much speculation for the chemical identity of benzene, until the correct structure was described by Friedrich August Kekulé. Likewise, the idea of stereoisomerism - that atoms have rigid three-dimensional structure and can thus form isomers that differ only in their three-dimensional arrangement - was another crucial step in understanding the concept of distinct chemical substances. For example, tartaric acid has three distinct isomers, a pair of diastereomers with one <b>diastereomer</b> forming two enantiomers.|$|E

40|$|International audienceStereochemistry {{plays an}} {{important}} role in biochemistry, particularly in therapeutic applications. Indeed, enantiomers have different biological activities, which can have important consequences. Many analytical techniques have been developed in order to allow the identification and the separation of stereoisomers. Here, we focused our work on the study of small <b>diastereomers</b> using the coupling of traveling wave ion mobility and mass spectrometry (TWIMS-MS) as a new alternative for stereochemistry study. In order to optimize the separation, the formation of adducts between <b>diastereomers</b> (M) and different alkali cations (X) was carried out. Thus, monomers [M + X](+) and multimers [2 M + X](+) and [3 M + X](+) ions have been studied from both experimental and theoretical viewpoints. Moreover, it has been shown that the study of the multimer [2 Y + M + Li](+) ion, in which Y is an auxiliary diastereomeric ligand, allows the <b>diastereomers</b> separation. The combination of cationization, multimers ions formation, and IM-MS is a novel and powerful approach for the <b>diastereomers</b> identification. Thus, by this technique, <b>diastereomers</b> can be identified although they present very close conformations in gaseous phase. This work presents the first TWIMS-MS separation of <b>diastereomers,</b> which present very close collision cross section thanks to the formation of multimers and the use of an auxiliary diastereomeric ligand...|$|R
50|$|The second step, {{once the}} <b>diastereomers</b> have formed, is to {{separate}} them using recrystallization.

40|$|Triplet lifetimes {{have been}} {{determined}} for the <b>diastereomers</b> {{of a broad}} set of butane-l, 4 -dione derivatives (1 - 3). A remarkable dependence of lifetimes on conformational preferences is revealed in that the lifetimes are shorter for the meso <b>diastereomers</b> of 1 - 3 than those for the racemic ones. The intramolecular beta-phenyl quenching is promoted {{in the case of}} meso <b>diastereomers</b> by virtue of the gauche relationship between the excited carbonyl group and the beta-aryl ring, while a distal arrangement in the lowest energy conformation (H-anti) in racemic <b>diastereomers</b> prevents such a deactivation. The involvement of charge transfer in the intramolecular beta-phenyl quenching is suggested by the correlation of the triplet lifetimes of the meso <b>diastereomers</b> of compounds 2 with the nature of the substituent on the beta-phenyl rings. In the case of racemic <b>diastereomers,</b> beta-methoxy substitution on the beta-phenyl ring (2 -OCH 3, 3 -OCH 3) also led to a decrease of the triplet lifetimes when compared to those of the nonsubstituted compounds (2 -H, 3 -H). This shortening is accounted for by the deactivation of a small proportion of the excited molecules through beta-phenyl quenching. In addition to the above factors, the lifetimes in the case of meso <b>diastereomers</b> can further be controlled by increasing the energy spacing between the T- 1 and T- 2 states, since beta-phenyl quenching occurs from the latter for compounds 2 and 3. Through a rational conformational control, a surprisingly long triplet lifetime (300 ns) has been measured for the first time for a purely n,pi* triplet-excited beta-phenylpropiophenone dimer (1 -rac) ...|$|R
