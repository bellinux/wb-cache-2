5|$|Bodyguard of Lies is a 1975 non-fiction {{book written}} by Anthony Cave Brown, {{his first major}} {{historical}} work. Named for a wartime quote of Winston Churchill, it is a narrative account of Allied military deception operations during the Second World War. The British and American governments resisted Brown's attempts to research the book. Many of the topics were still classified and he was denied access to British war records. The material <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> predominantly based on oral testimony {{as well as some}} American records, declassified toward the end of Brown's research.|$|E
5|$|It {{was written}} in the {{afternoon}} in the intervals of some other writing. The desk was in an upstairs room, by a window looking down a wooded hill. It {{was written in}} a little notebook in which his father and mother wrote out copies of several of their poems and, in most cases, added the date of composition. On one page the first two lines of 'Trees' appear, with the date, February 2, 1913, and on another page, further on <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>book,</b> <b>is</b> the full text of the poem. It was dedicated to his wife's mother, Mrs. Henry Mills Alden, who was endeared to all her family.|$|E
5|$|Rick Holland, an {{instructor}} at The Master's College and Seminary and pastor of College and Student Ministries at Grace Community Church, criticized the Ludys' description of dating, claiming it was based too much on anecdotes and not enough on the Bible. Nonetheless, he commended the couple on the relevant Bible verses they do quote and {{he argued that the}} advice the Ludys share <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> sound and that their story is an encouraging one.|$|E

5|$|In 1948, in {{preparation}} for independence, Nigeria's first university opened. Known as University College (now the University of Ibadan), it was an associate college of the University of London. Achebe obtained such high marks in the entrance examination that he was admitted as a Major Scholar in the university's first intake and given a bursary to study medicine. It was during his studies at Ibadan that Achebe began to become critical of European literature about Africa. After reading Joyce Cary's 1939 work Mister Johnson about a cheerful Nigerian man who (among other things) works for an abusive British storeowner, he was so disturbed by the book's portrayal of its Nigerian characters as either savages or buffoons {{that he decided to}} become a writer. Achebe recognised his dislike for the African protagonist {{as a sign of the}} author's cultural ignorance. One of his classmates announced to the professor that the only enjoyable moment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> when Johnson is shot.|$|E
5|$|Inter-Sultanate marriages {{normalised}} {{relations and}} Ali I (1557–1580) joined a confederacy of Sultanates who eventually inflicted a crushing defeat on the Vijayanagara Empire in 1565. The most notable {{ruler of the}} dynasty was Ibrahim II (1580–1626) who ascended the throne as a nine-year-old with Chandbibi, the king's aunt acting as the regent. Later when Ibrahim II was defeated by {{the first of the}} Moghul incursions into the Deccan, he gave his daughter in marriage to Daniyal, a son of Emperor Akbar, but managed to collect tributes from the former feudatories of the Vijayanagara Empire. According to a historian, the rule of Ibrahim II was the high point of the Bijapur Sultanate. A tolerant king inclined to the fine arts, the earliest book on music in Urdu language called Kitab-e-Nauras is ascribed to him. The opening song <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> an invocation of the Hindu Goddess Saraswati. During the rule of his son Muhammad, Shahji Bhosle from Ahmadnagar joined the Bijapur army and along with commander Ranadullah Khan conducted many successful campaigns in the southern Deccan collecting tribute from local rulers there. The final end of the diminished Vijayanagara Empire ruling from Vellore came during these campaigns.|$|E

5|$|More recently, Maurice Friedman {{writes about}} the book {{in the context of}} the various {{attempts}} to find a universal essence - or perennial philosophy - within religion. He finds that Time and Eternity is a more systematic attempt at this than those proposed by Aldous Huxley or Ananda Coomaraswamy, but no more successful. For Friedman, the philosophy that Stace lays out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> derived from metaphysical speculation (that, like the ideas of Huxley and Coomaraswamy, is influenced by Vedanta), rather than mystical experience. Central to Friedman’s critique is the notion that there is a vast gulf between the mystical experience which Stace defines as beyond thought, and his philosophical system built on this. He also mentions that mystics do not always agree on what experiences, symbols and philosophies are the closest to the divine.|$|E

5000|$|The Mystery of the Blue Train {{was first}} serialised <b>in</b> <b>the</b> London evening {{newspaper}} <b>The</b> Star <b>in</b> thirty-eight un-illustrated instalments from Wednesday 1 February to Thursday 15 March 1928. The entire first two chapters were {{omitted from the}} serialisation and it therefore contained only thirty-four chapters. There were slight amendments to the text, either {{to make sense of}} the openings of an instalment (e.g. changing [...] "She then..." [...] to [...] "Katherine then..."), or omitting small sentences or words, especially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opening instalment where several paragraphs were omitted. A reference to the continental Daily Mail at the start of chapter six (chapter eight <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>book)</b> <b>was</b> changed to [...] "the newspaper" [...] to avoid mentioning a competitor to The Star. Three chapters were given different names: chapter nine (eleven <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>book)</b> <b>was</b> called Something Good instead of Murder, chapter twenty-six (twenty-eight <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>book)</b> <b>was</b> called Poirot hedges instead of Poirot plays the Squirrel and chapter twenty-eight (chapter thirty <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>book)</b> <b>was</b> called Katherine's letters instead of Miss Viner gives judgement.

5000|$|<b>The</b> main {{character}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>is</b> Uppo-Nalle, an animate teddy bear who loves poetry. The bear was named Uppo-Nalle (Finnish for [...] "sunken bear") {{because he was}} originally found underwater during a river cruise. Other characters <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>are</b> a girl named Reeta, her grandmother, and their dog named Laulava Lintukoira (Finnish for [...] "singing bird dog").|$|R
25|$|In Sherman Alexie's novel Reservation Blues, Sheridan {{is portrayed}} as a head hunter for a record label {{responsible}} for {{the downfall of the}} novel's protagonist's band Coyote Springs.

25|$|The Oz portrayed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> {{very close}} to Baum's Oz, {{although}} Heinlein does make an attempt to explain some things {{from the standpoint of}} a science fiction author. He explains that Oz is on a retrograde planet, where the direction of rotation relative to the poles is reversed, resulting in the sun seeming to rise in what would normally be the west.|$|E
25|$|Rising Storm is a children's fantasy novel, {{the fourth}} {{book in the}} Warriors series, written by Cherith Baldry and Kate Cary (Plus two others) under the pen name of Erin Hunter. Rising Storm was written by Kate Cary. The series follows the adventures of four Clans of wild, {{anthropomorphic}} cats. In the previous book, Forest of Secrets, Graystripe's mate, Silverstream, died while giving birth. ThunderClan and RiverClan fought over the two kits, seeing {{as the mother of}} the kits, Silverstream, was the daughter of the RiverClan leader, Crookedstar, and the father was Graystripe, a ThunderClan warrior. Graystripe decided to join RiverClan, despite knowing he will be shunned there. In Rising Storm, Fireheart has to tackle his new duties as deputy, knowing that the old one, Tigerclaw, who had been exiled, is in the forest somewhere, seeking revenge against Fireheart, Bluestar, and ThunderClan. At the end of the book, Tigerclaw becomes leader of ShadowClan and receives the name Tigerstar, finally achieving the position he killed for. The main theme <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> power. The forest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> inspired by multiple natural locations, such as the New Forest, in southern England.|$|E

25|$|The film also {{altered the}} {{circumstances}} of Théoden's death; his death speech, in which he names Éomer the new king <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>book,</b> <b>is</b> trimmed and delivered to Éowyn instead of Merry, with an earlier scene in the Extended Edition even implying that Éowyn is next {{in line for the}} throne. Théoden's rallying speech ("To death!") before the initial charge in the film are spoken by Éomer in the book when he believes that both Théoden and Éowyn have been killed in combat with the Witch King.|$|E
25|$|Christine Hayes {{contrasts}} the Book of Esther with apocalyptic writings, the Book of Daniel in particular: both Esther and Daniel depict {{an existential}} {{threat to the}} Jewish people, but while Daniel commends the Jews to wait faithfully for God to resolve the crisis, in Esther the crisis is resolved entirely through human action and national solidarity. God, in fact, is not mentioned, Esther is portrayed as assimilated to Persian culture, and Jewish identity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> an ethnic category rather than a religious one.|$|E
25|$|Alonso Quixano, {{the protagonist}} of the novel (though he is not given this name until much later <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>book),</b> <b>is</b> a Hidalgo (member of the lesser Spanish nobility), nearing 50 years of age, living in an unnamed section of La Mancha with his niece and housekeeper, {{as well as a}} boy who is never heard of again after the first chapter. Although Quixano is usually a {{rational}} man, in keeping with the humoral theory of the time, not sleeping adequately — because he was reading — has caused his brain to dry; Quixano's temperament is thus choleric, the hot and dry humor. As a result, he is easily given to anger and believes every word of these fictional books of chivalry to be true.|$|E

25|$|Danish scholar Arne Søby Christensen on {{the other}} hand claims that the Getica was an entirely {{fabricated}} account, and that the origin of the Goths <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> a construction based on popular Greek and Roman myths as well as a misinterpretation of recorded names from Northern Europe. The purpose of this fabrication, according to Christensen, was to establish a glorious identity for the peoples that had recently gained power in post-Roman Europe. Canadian scholar Walter Goffart suggests another incentive: Getica was part of a conscious plan by emperor Justinian and the propaganda machine at his court. He wanted to affirm that Goths (and their barbarian cousins) did not belong to the Roman world, thus justifying the claims of the Eastern Roman Empire to {{the western part of the}} latter.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} other small {{differences}} between the books and the movie. For example, when Dorothy arrives in Munchkinland the Munchkins are seen wearing colorful costumes, but in the book Munchkins are said to only wear blue as blue is the official dominant color of the east. The first witch Dorothy meets in Oz <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> the Good Witch of the North, a minor character that only had one other appearance in Baum's books but is an important figure of Oz nonetheless. In the movie this character is conflated with that of Glinda, who is the Good Witch of the South and does not make an appearance {{until the very end}} of Baum's story. The character of Glinda in the books dresses in all white silk, as white is the traditional color for good witches, whereas in the film she is seen in pink.|$|E
25|$|There {{is also no}} {{scene of}} a death in Laura’s {{household}} grounds, nor any party described in them, and after finding her Grenouille does not visit her again until his preparations are complete. Instead, the novel describes Grenouille as deciding to kill his second victim {{in much the same}} manner as the first - purely because of an overwhelming impulse to possess her scent. His other victims are also killed purely for the purpose of practicing human scent preservation and perhaps because of the youthful appearance they all share, somewhat reminiscent of Laura, rather than for their perfume-related qualities or to combine with hers. The final perfume he creates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> a combination of ingredients, none of which are described except that from Laura. Laura's father does not encounter Grenouille until the latter is imminently to be executed, and there is no torture scene described in the book in which he is present.|$|E
