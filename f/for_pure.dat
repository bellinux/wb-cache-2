5|$|Because of its rarity, it {{is among}} the most {{expensive}} elements. Price <b>for</b> <b>pure</b> scandium fluctuates between 4 000 and 20 000 US dollars per kilogram. Meanwhile, the limited market generates a variety of prices at any given time. In 2010, {{at the peak of the}} rare-earths shortage, the price of scandium rose to over 15,000 US dollars per kilogram, and the widely commercially used scandium oxide (Sc2O3) was selling above 7 000 US dollars per kilogram. Since then the limited demand coupled with steady production keeps the price at its 20-year average.|$|E
5|$|For {{a general}} system, states are {{typically}} not pure, but instead are represented as statistical mixtures of pure states, or mixed states, given by density matrices: self-adjoint operators of trace {{one on a}} Hilbert space. Moreover, for general quantum mechanical systems, {{the effects of a}} single measurement can influence other parts of a system {{in a manner that is}} described instead by a positive operator valued measure. Thus the structure both of the states and observables in the general theory is considerably more complicated than the idealization <b>for</b> <b>pure</b> states.|$|E
