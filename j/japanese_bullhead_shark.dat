25|$|A modest-sized shark {{reaching}} a maximum known length of , the <b>Japanese</b> <b>bullhead</b> <b>shark</b> has a cylindrical {{body with the}} short, wide head and blunt, pig-like snout typical of the bullhead sharks. The eyes lack a nictitating membrane and are followed by tiny spiracles. Shallow supraorbital ridges are present above the eyes, and the space between them is slightly concave. The nostrils are divided into incurrent and excurrent openings by long flaps of skin that reach the mouth; the incurrent opening is encircled by a groove while another groove runs from the excurrent opening to the mouth. The small mouth is positioned nearly {{at the tip of}} the snout; the front teeth are small with a sharp central cusp flanked by a pair of lateral cusplets, while the back teeth are broad and rounded. There are deep furrows at the corners of the mouth, extending onto both jaws.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Japanese</b> <b>{{bullhead}}</b> <b>shark</b> (Heterodontus japonicus) is {{a species}} of bullhead shark in the family Heterodontidae found in the northwestern Pacific Ocean off the coasts of Japan, Korea, and China. This benthic shark occurs at depths of [...] over rocky bottoms or kelp beds. Measuring up to [...] long, it can be identified by its short, blunt head, two high dorsal fins with anterior spines, and pattern of irregularly shaped, vertical brown bands and stripes. The <b>Japanese</b> <b>bullhead</b> <b>shark</b> is a docile, slow-swimming species that feeds mainly on shelled invertebrates and small bony fishes. Reproduction is oviparous, with females laying spiral-flanged eggs in communal [...] "nests". This species is of little interest to fisheries.|$|E

50|$|Inoffensive towards humans, the crested <b>bullhead</b> <b>shark</b> is {{of little}} {{interest}} to recreational or commercial fisheries. It is seldom caught on hook-and-line. Commercial bottom trawl prawn fisheries operating off Queensland and New South Wales take this species as bycatch; {{the impact of these}} activities on the population is uncertain as this species is not recorded separately from the Port Jackson <b>shark.</b> However, most <b>bullhead</b> <b>sharks</b> caught in these fisheries survive to be released alive. Crested <b>bullhead</b> <b>sharks</b> are likely also caught in mesh shark nets used to protect beaches; again, most are able to survive the experience. Because of the limited mortality suffered by this species from various human activities, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this species as of Least Concern, albeit also recommending that it be carefully monitored given its restricted distribution and overall uncommonness. The range of the crested <b>bullhead</b> <b>shark</b> overlaps with several marine protected areas; additionally, it was listed as a declared animal in Schedule 3 of the 1997 Queensland Marine Parks (Moreton Bay) Zoning Plan, which regulates its collection in Moreton Bay Marine Park.|$|R
