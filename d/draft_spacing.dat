The Department of Defense's (DOD) space systems collect information on capabilities and intentions of potential adversaries. They enable military forces to be warned of a missile attack and to communicate and navigate while avoiding hostile action. DOD's efforts to strengthen space control are targeted at seeking to promote better coordination among DOD components, prioritization of projects, visibility and accountability over funding, and interoperability among systems. Among other things, DOD is <b>drafting</b> a <b>space</b> control strategy that is to outline objectives, tasks, and capabilities for the next 20 years. It has also aggregated funding for space programs {{so that it can}} compare space funding, including space control funding, to its total budget, make decisions about priorities, and conduct future-trend analyses. In addition, DOD has changed its acquisition policy to include separating technology development from product development and encouraging an evolutionary, or phased, approach to development. There are, however, substantial challenges to making DOD's space control efforts successful. One challenge is putting needed plans in place to provide direction and hold the services accountable for implementing departmentwide priorities for space control. Further, DOD's <b>draft</b> <b>space</b> control strategy has been completed and does not yet define roles and responsibilities among the services, departmentwide priorities and end states, and concrete milestones. Finally DOD's aggregation of space funding is not a plan that targets investments at priority areas for DOD overall. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the hydroelastic responses and hydrodynamic interactions of two large floating fuel storage modules placed side-by-side with the presence of floating breakwaters. These modules and breakwaters form the floating fuel storage facility (FFSF). The floating storage modules and breakwaters are modeled as plates and the linear wave theory is used to model the water waves in the numerical model. The numerical model is verified with existing numerical results and validated with experimental test. Numerical simulations are performed to determine the hydroelastic behavior and hydrodynamic interactions of floating storage modules placed adjacent to each other and enclosed by floating breakwaters under various incident wave angles. The effects of breakwaters, <b>drafts,</b> channel <b>spacing</b> formed by the two adjacent modules and water depth on the hydroelastic responses of the modules are investigated.

40|$|An Innovative Tension Leg Platform (TLP) Optimization Program, called ITOP, {{has been}} {{developed}} to solve the multi-objective optimization problem for TLP. We first examine the hydrodynamic behavior of a base TLP for wave headings between 0 ∘ and 45 ∘. The numerical {{results show that the}} maximum heave and surge motion responses occur in 0 ∘ wave heading in long-crest waves. It is found that the dynamic tension of No. 8 tendon is larger than the other tendons and reaches its maximum in 45 ∘ wave heading. It {{can be attributed to the}} fact that heave and pitch motions are almost out of phase for wave periods between 10 and 15 s. Because the maximum wave elevation occurs near the northeast column and the vertical motion is very small, the minimum airgap occurs there. Moreover, a surrogate model based on radial basis function (RBF) has been built and adopted to estimate the hydrodynamic performance of TLP. A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGAII), is employed to find the Pareto-optimal solutions. By comprehensive and systematic computations and analyses, it is revealed that the maximum dynamic tension shows positive correlation with pontoon height and width, but negative correlation with hull <b>draft,</b> column <b>spacing,</b> and column diameter. The most efficient modification strategy for design is proposed to reduce the maximum dynamic tendon tension. According to the strategy, the column <b>spacing,</b> <b>draft,</b> and column diameter should be increased in sequence. By applying this strategy, the maximum dynamic tendon tensions can be reduced while the total weight of the platform is minimized as much as possible...|$|R

40|$|Members of the Commercial Technology Office at the NASA Glenn Research Center have {{developed}} an exciting new tool that greatly reduces the lead time in creating and routing Space Act Agreements. The Space Act Agreement Maker (SAAM) is an e-government Web-based system that automates the initial <b>drafting</b> of <b>Space</b> Act Agreements by technical and program personnel. SAAM also is used for editing and will be used later for maintaining electronic copies of all Space Act Agreements. During the initial drafting, the software prompts NASA personnel proposing an agreement to answer questions regarding the agreement. On {{the basis of the}} answers, the software selects from a matrix of NASA standard clauses to produce a first draft of the agreement. The draft agreement and information submitted by the NASA personnel are electronically routed to Glenn s Commercial Technology Office for review and, where necessary, editing. The final version of the agreement, along with any supporting documentation, is then routed for electronic concurrence/approval to the necessary internal review participants using the electronic routing system (e-router). SAAM was developed cooperatively by Glenn s Commercial Technology Office and Glenn s Office of Chief Counsel. Currently, SAAM is being evaluated by the NASA Headquarters General Counsel Office for use at all NASA centers. This system allows for the effective processing of Space Act Agreements for NASA s internal and external customers. Document control is maintained by a database. With SAAM s electronic routing, review times can be reduced significantly, allowing Glenn to more rapidly establish partnerships with industry. Prior to the creation of SAAM, it took several hours to <b>draft</b> a <b>Space</b> Act Agreement. With SAAM in place, the document can be written in about 30 min. Using the e-router also saves time in determining where the agreement is in the routing process. The document can be tracked easily, and delays can be avoided. Important research with industry partners can commence quickly after preliminary discussions have been held. The development of these products is in line with the expanding e-government initiative {{that is part of the}} Presidential Management Agenda. By using this product, NASA researchers can secure greater support from industry and academia partners. The Space Act Agreement Maker has been very well received at NASA Headquarters and at some of the other NASA centers as well. We anticipate that the NASA Ames Research Center will have the system in place very soon, and that some of the other centers will use SAAM in the near future. The General Counsel s office at NASA Headquarters has encouraged the Glenn team to develop a similar system for processing patent licenses.

40|$|Speculation {{with regard}} to a {{permanent}} lunar base {{has been with us}} since Robert Goddard was working on the first liquid-fueled rockets in the 1920 's.

This article, originally <b>drafted</b> by World <b>Space</b> Foundation volunteers in conjuction with various academic and research groups, examines some of the strategies involved in selecting an appropriate site for such a lunar base.

30|$|Lastly, the {{correction}} symbols from Olsher (1995) adopted by Sampson (2012) were provided but examples were only provided of how uncoded errors were marked. Since Sampson claims {{the usage of}} symbols are helpful to L 2 writers, then examples of their use with the L 2 writer data collected should have been provided. It is indeterminable whether any systematic method of placement of the symbols was implemented since this was not reported. Furthermore, although underlining of errors was considered as uncoded error feedback, the examples of uncoded feedback given by Sampson are problematic. Specifically, underlining a single letter as in the example “My birthday is in januray.” is likely to signal {{a different type of}} result from L 2 writers than for underlining of a single word as in the example “We luve chocolate.” or the underlining of multiple words in the example “I you see will later.” The different types of underlining in themselves could be considered a type of coded feedback. Besides, in the example given by Sampson for the error type “Add something”, it is unclear how to underline an error of something that is missing. In the example provided “It is _____ beautiful afternoon” a space exists, but in an L 2 writer’s <b>draft</b> this <b>space</b> will not exist since the writer will have left something out. So where should the underlining appear? This is another reason why details regarding the placement of both uncoded and coded feedback should have been provided. Furthermore, the concept of “error” is not explained well in the study. Specifically, “gently person” is marked as an error but could be labeled as either “word formation,” “spelling,” or “wrong word.” The term “add something” seems too general and would prevent the L 2 writer from addressing the error. “Reverse word order” and “word order mistake” seem too similar to constitute two separate categories. “Rewrite” is a label for meaning-oriented errors or content errors, which are not easily fixed through a single revision by an L 2 writer.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} spectral solar irradiance (SSI) and ozone in the tropical upper stratosphere. We find that solar cycle (SC) changes in ozone can be well approximated by considering the ozone response to SSI changes in a small number individual wavelength bands between 176 and 310 nm, operating independently of each other. Additionally, {{we find that the}} ozone varies approximately linearly with changes in the SSI. Using these facts, we present a Bayesian formalism for inferring SC SSI changes and uncertainties from measured SC ozone profiles. Bayesian inference is a powerful, mathematically self-consistent method of considering both the uncertainties of the data and additional external information to provide the best estimate of parameters being estimated. Using this method, we show that, given measurement uncertainties in both ozone and SSI datasets, it is not currently possible to distinguish between observed or modelled SSI datasets using available estimates of ozone change profiles, although this might be possible by the inclusion of other external constraints. Our methodology has the potential, using wider datasets, to provide better understanding of both variations in SSI and the atmospheric response.

40|$|The {{international}} space law regime mandates that individual nation states are both responsible and liable for their respective national space activities. This {{is one of}} the most important norms of space law, which face today more than never the challenge to regulate many serious legal issues emerged in full force last decades in space activities, like space security, permanent sustainability of the use and exploration of outer space, global space governance, space cooperation for the sustainable national development of the majority of States in all continents, and many others. In this context, the participation of all States, whether individually or multilaterally, is essential to achieve more effective advances in the progressive development of {{international space}} law. Indeed, international space law is now confronted with subjects as varied as the manufacture and deployment of small satellites, space debris, transfer of ownership of space objects while in orbit, space tourism, and the avoidance of flags of convenience in space activities, among others. Each State has the right to create its national policy and legislation for space activities, which must be in accordance with the international space law in force and the general international law. Consequently, nation states such as Brazil that intend to develop their national space industries and become launching states should <b>draft</b> national <b>space</b> legislation which promotes both the safety as well as adequate supervision and control of space-related activities within their respective territory. The creation of a new general law regarding space activities in Brazil is outlined in its new National Space Activities Program (PNAE 2012 - 2021) issued by the Brazilian Space Agency in 2012. In order to cooperate with the Agency in achieving this objective, the Brazilian Association of Air and Space Law (SBDA), through its Space Law Working Group, has been working since the beginning of last year (2013) to prepare a proposed project of Brazilian national space legislation in concert with the PNAE which takes into account the salient features of the space legislation of other national states as well as the Sofia Guidelines.

40|$|Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (MPS) in Göttingen, Germany {{planned to}} build a {{scientific}} payload Sub-Millimeter Wave Instrument (SWI) that will be on-board the Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE) Spacecraft. The launch is expected in 2022. The main blocks of the instrument include Telescope and Receiver Unit (TRU), Radiator Unit (RU) and Electronics Unit (EU). The TRU consists of two main scanning mechanisms namely Cross-Track (CT) and Along-Track (AT) scanning mechanisms. This thesis describes {{the design of a}} conceptual Launch Lock (LL) that locks the scanning mechanisms. It also discusses the Quasi Static Load (QSL) and vibration simulations of Breadboard TRU. The main purpose of the LL is to lock the moving parts of a payload in a suitable position and release it after launch. Initial design of the LL was already developed at MPS but later due to design iterations it was completely changed considering mass and function. Topology Optimization Technique was implemented to check the Element Strain Energy Density Distribution in the parts which were later incorporated into the design. Two LL’s were developed with same operating principle one for CT and other for AT scanning mechanisms. Simulations were performed applying QSL on both LL’s and results were evaluated. Breadboard model of Burn Wire Release Mechanism (BWRM) and Tensioning Mechanism (TM) were designed to check the applicability of Dyneema and Vectran strings that keeps the LL in the locked position. The LL was designed successfully and integrated with the Breadboard TRU. The second main work discussed are the dynamic simulations of the Breadboard TRU. Launch loads that include sine and random loads are studied from the Experiment Interface Document Part-A (EID-A) <b>drafted</b> by European <b>Space</b> Agency (ESA). These loads were converted to a suitable form which could be directly used as an input for vibration simulations using Siemens NX Software with NX Nastran Solver. Normal Mode Analysis was performed to check the natural frequencies of the TRU. Acceleration and Von-mises stress plots are generated under sine and QSL/random loads respectively. The results are discussed further. From the simulation predicted results it is confirmed that TRU qualifies for a real time shaker test.
