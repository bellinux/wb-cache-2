40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Seven human alcohol {{dehydrogenase}} genes (which encode the primary enzymes involved in alcohol metabolism) are grouped into classes based on function and sequence identity. While the Class I ADH isoenzymes {{contribute significantly to}} ethanol metabolism in the liver, Class IV ADH isoenzymes {{are involved in the}} first-pass metabolism of ethanol. It has been suggested that the ability to efficiently oxidize ethanol occurred late in primate evolution. Kinetic data obtained from the Class I ADH isoenzymes of marmoset and brown lemur, in addition to data from resurrected ancestral human Class IV ADH isoenzymes, supports this proposal [...] suggesting that two major events which occurred during primate evolution resulted in major adaptations toward ethanol metabolism. First, while human Class IV ADH first appeared 520 million years ago, a major adaptation to ethanol occurred very recently (approximately 15 million years ago); which was caused by a single amino acid change (A 294 V). This change increases the catalytic efficiency of the human Class IV enzymes toward ethanol by over 79 -fold. Secondly, the Class I ADH form developed 80 million years ago [...] when angiosperms first began to produce fleshy fruits whose sugars are fermented to ethanol by yeasts. This was followed by the duplication and divergence of distinct Class I ADH isoforms [...] which occurred during mammalian radiation. This duplication event was followed by a second duplication/divergence event which occurred around or just before the emergence of prosimians (some 40 million years ago). We examined the multiple Class I isoforms from species with distinct dietary preferences (lemur and marmoset) in an effort to correlate diets rich in <b>fermentable</b> <b>fruits</b> with increased catalytic capacity toward ethanol oxidation. Our kinetic data support this hypothesis in that the species with a high content of <b>fermentable</b> <b>fruit</b> in its diet possess greater catalytic capacity toward ethanol...|$|R
30|$|Lignocellulose biomass, {{found in}} several {{agriculture}} residues, {{is the most}} abundant renewable resource in the word. Lately, this material has been considered for biotechnological applications. Cellulose is the most abundant polymer in nature and represents 50  % of the natural biomass (Wang et al. 2012). This biopolymer is composed of glucose units linked by β-(1 - 4) glucosidic bonds (Kinnarinen et al. 2012). Lignocellulose and lignin are usually found in cellulosic materials in different degrees depending on the biomass source (Wickramasinghe and Grzenia 2008). However, cellulosic materials are not <b>directly</b> <b>fermentable,</b> and a hydrolysis step is necessary to obtain simple sugars that can be metabolized by microorganisms (Singh et al. 2010).|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Sweet sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] {{stands out}} as a {{complementary}} crop to sugarcane Saccharum spp. {{for the production of}} ethanol, since it has juicy stems with <b>directly</b> <b>fermentable</b> sugars. Due to this fact, {{there is a need for}} the analysis of sweet sorghum properties in order to meet the agro-industry demand. This work aimed to develop and study the maturation curves of seven sweet sorghum cultivars in ten harvest dates. The results showed a significant difference between cultivars and harvest dates for all parameters analysed (p&# 8804; 0. 01). Regarding the sugar content, the cultivars BRS 508, XBWS 80147 and CMSX 629 showed the highest means for the total reducing sugars (TRS) and recoverable sugar (RS). In the production of ethanol per tonne of biomass (EP), the cultivars BRS 508 and CMSX 629 presented the best results...|$|R
40|$|Background: Two {{economic}} factors make watermelon worthy of consideration as a feedstock for ethanol biofuel production. First, about 20 % of each annual watermelon crop {{is left in}} the field because of surface blemishes or because they are misshapen; currently these are lost to growers {{as a source of}} revenue. Second, the neutraceutical value of lycopene and L-citrulline obtained from watermelon is at a threshold whereby watermelon could serve as starting material to extract and manufacture these products. Processing of watermelons to produce lycopene and L-citrulline, yields a waste stream of watermelon juice at the rate of over 500 L/t of watermelons. Since watermelon juice contains 7 to 10 % (w/v) <b>directly</b> <b>fermentable</b> sugars and 15 to 35 μmol/ml of free amino acids, its potential as feedstock, diluent, and nitrogen supplement was investigated in fermentations to produce bioethanol.

40|$|Sweet sorghum has {{considerable}} {{potential for}} ethanol production {{due to its}} succulent stalks that contain <b>directly</b> <b>fermentable</b> sugars. Since many traits {{need to be considered}} in the selection process to breed superior cultivars for ethanol production, then correlations between the traits might be of use to help the breeder define optimal improvement strategies. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the association between the principal agro-industrial traits in sweet sorghum, and to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of primary and secondary traits on ethanol production per hectare. In total, 45 sweet sorghum genotypes (lineage/hybrids) were evaluated in an experiment designed in an alpha lattice 5 x 9. The data were analyzed using a mixed model approach. A detailed study of simple correlations was accomplished using path analysis. The experimental precision was high, with an accuracy above 76 %. The various genotypes showed genetic variation for all agronomic and industrial traits, except stalk diameter. Some agro-industrial traits showed significant simple correlations with ethanol production, but according to the path analysis, some of these traits did not show a significant direct or indirect effect on ethanol production. The results highlighted the primary and secondary traits with practical relevance to sweet sorghum breeding, since they showed director indirect effects on ethanol production. 201...|$|R
30|$|Currently, {{the major}} {{bottlenecks}} faced by industrial enzyme producers are low yield and high production cost. For instant, media {{used for the}} production of hydrolases such as lipase generally involve expensive complex carbon and nitrogen sources that are responsible for as much as 70 % raw material costs in extracellular enzyme fermentation (Jamrath et al. 2012). The exploitation of lignocelluloses materials including agroindustrial waste may hence serve as effective and cheap alternative in producing enzymes at appreciable level for commercial use. Furthermore, the use of agricultural residues for industrial purposes is more environmental friendly than other disposal methods commonly adopted nowadays. Coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) has been grown in more than 85 countries worldwide with Indonesia, Philippines, India, Brazil and Sri Lanka being among the top producers (Siddiq 2012). Coconut dregs is basically a residue from coconut oil and milk processing plants. This lignocelluloses biomass is abundantly available at low or without cost and commonly used as fertiliser, animal feed or simply left to decay on the fields (Sulaiman et al. 2013). Nonetheless, the utilisation of this by-product has been recently extended to more refined applications including as a nutrient rich substrate for oyster mushroom cultivation (Vetayasuporn 2007) and biodiesel production (Sulaiman et al. 2013) owing to its high coconut oil content. The solid coconut waste from coconut milk extraction process was found to have up to 24 wt% oil content (Sarina et al. 2013). In addition, the coconut waste comprises high concentration of <b>directly</b> <b>fermentable</b> carbohydrates that can be converted into free sugar by a simple chemical pre-hydrolysis during sterilisation of the medium followed by enzymatic action of the bacteria during fermentation (Ding et al. 2012).|$|R

Results Complete watermelon juice and that which did not contain the chromoplasts (lycopene), but did contain free amino acids, were readily fermentable as the sole feedstock or as diluent, feedstock supplement, and nitrogen supplement to granulated sugar or molasses. A minimum level of ~ 400 mg N/L (~ 15 μmol/ml amino nitrogen) in watermelon juice was required to achieve maximal fermentation rates when it was employed as the sole nitrogen source for the fermentation. Fermentation at pH 5 produced the highest rate of fermentation for the yeast system that was employed. Utilizing watermelon juice as diluent, supplemental feedstock, and nitrogen source for fermentation of processed sugar or molasses allowed complete fermentation of up to 25 % (w/v) sugar concentration at pH 3 (0. 41 to 0. 46 g ethanol per g sugar) or up to 35 % (w/v) sugar concentration at pH 5 with a conversion to 0. 36 to 0. 41 g ethanol per g sugar. Conclusion Although watermelon juice would have to be concentrated 2. 5 - to 3 -fold to serve as the sole feedstock for ethanol biofuel production, the results of this investigation indicate that watermelon juice, either as whole juice fermented on-site or as a waste stream from neutraceutical production, could easily integrate with other more concentrated feedstocks where it could serve as diluent, supplemental feedstock, and nitrogen supplement. </p...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a novel, "single experiment" {{methodology}} based on genetic engineering of metabolic pathways for direct intracellular production of non-canonical amino acids from simple precursors, coupled with expanded genetic code. In particular, we engineered the intracellular biosynthesis of L-Azidohomoalanine from O-Acetyl-L-homoserine and NaN 3, and achieved its direct incorporation into recombinant target proteins by AUG codon reassignment in a methionine-Auxotroph E. coli strain. In our system, the host's methionine biosynthetic pathway was first diverted towards {{the production of the}} desired non-canonical amino acid by exploiting the broad reaction specificity of recombinant pyridoxal phosphate-dependent O-Acetylhomoserine sulfhydrylase from Corynebacterium glutamicum. Then, the expression of the target protein barstar, accompanied with efficient L-Azidohomoalanine incorporation in place of L-methionine, was accomplished.

40|$|Lignocellulosic biomass is {{the most}} {{abundant}} renewable energy bioresources available today. Due to its recalcitrant structure, lignocellulosic feedstocks cannot be <b>directly</b> converted into <b>fermentable</b> sugars. Thus, an additional step known as the pretreatment is needed for efficient enzyme hydrolysis {{for the release of}} sugars. Various pretreatment technologies have been developed and examined for different biomass feedstocks. One of the major concerns of pretreatments is the degradation of sugars and formation of inhibitors during pretreatment. The inhibitor formation affects in the following steps after pretreatments such as enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation for the release of different bioenergy products. The sugar degradation and formation of inhibitors depend on the types and conditions of pretreatment and types of biomass. This review covers the structure of lignocellulose, followed by the factors affecting pretreatment and challenges of pretreatment. This review further discusses diverse types of pretreatment technologies and different applications of pretreatment for producing biogas, biohydrogen, ethanol, and butanol...|$|R
40|$|Improper {{disposal}} of 1, 4 -dioxane and the chlorinated organic solvents trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE) {{has resulted in}} widespread contamination of soil and groundwater. In the present study, a novel microbially-driven Fenton reaction system was designed to generate hydroxyl (HO) radicals for simultaneous degradation of source zone levels of single, binary, and ternary mixtures of TCE, PCE, and 1, 4 -dioxane. The new Fenton reaction system was driven by the Fe(III) -reducing facultative anaerobe Shewanella oneidensis amended with lactate, Fe(III), and contaminant mixtures and exposed to alternating anaerobic and aerobic conditions. The novel microbially-driven Fenton reaction system successfully degraded TCE, PCE, and 1, 4 -dioxane either as single contaminants or as binary and ternary mixtures. Degradation of lignocellulosic biomass was also demonstrated through the novel microbially driven fenton reaction by S. oneidensis. In this study, we have developed a new method that combines both pretreatment and saccharification of cellulose and xylan in a microbially driven fenton reaction. The combined pretreatment and saccharification method for cellulose and xylan developed did not involve the addition of acid, alkali compounds {{or the use of}} hydrolyzing enzymes thus being an economically feasible process to <b>directly</b> produce simple <b>fermentable</b> sugars from cellulose and xylan. Microbial Fe(III) reduction is a dominant anaerobic respiratory process in soil and sediments, which suggests that the microbially driven fenton reaction may {{play an important role in}} the degradation of decaying plant and woody materials in the natural environment. The expansion of metabolic capability to convert D-xylose to a useful product such as PHB can be beneficial in biotechnological applications to couple multiple carbon sources such as glucose, glycerol and D-xylose by S. oneidensis to improve efficiency of electricity generation, biofuel production and bioremediation of toxic contaminants.

40|$|Recent omics level {{studies are}} {{confirming}} what pioneers in gut microbiology {{have been saying}} for some time, that diet:microbe interactions impact on human health and disease risk (Midtvedt, 1974; Rowland, 1988). The post genomics technologies of metagenomics and metabolomics are decoding the detailed cross-talk between the structure and function of the intestinal microbiome and host physiology, with diet:microbe interactions now shown to impact on the risk of cardio-metabolic disease, cancers, immune diseases and psychiatric disorders (Nicholson et al, 2012). The gut microbiota is becoming recognised as an important metabolic and immunological organ in its own right, intricately linked to the functioning of other organs most notably the liver, adipose tissue and the brain. Evidence mainly from animal studies describe important roles for gut microbiota metabolites and/or microbiota immunological regulation of metabolic and inflammatory pathways critical for maintenance of host defences. Indeed, such studies hint at common underlying pathological processes linking diet:microbe interactions in the gut with a spectrum of chronic diseases along the gut:liver:fat:brain axis. Indeed, different aspects of this gut:liver:fat:brain axis are currently receiving much attention for their role in obesity, the diseases of obesity (cardiovascular-disease, type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, Alzheimer’s disease) and psychiatric conditions such as autism, Schizophrenia and importantly, depression. Many of these diseases are characterised by loss of metabolic homeostasis and unresolved systemic inflammation. While the gut microbiota have been shown to produce toxic compounds for example trimethylamine-N-oxide and N-nitroso compounds derived from amino acid/protein fermentation n the gut, many microbial metabolites impact beneficially on host health, especially those which derive from the breakdown and fermentation of plant macromolecules, fibers and polyphenols. Short chain fatty acids and small phenolic compounds derived from colonic carbohydrate fermentation and plant polyphenol catabolism respectively, have been shown to {{play a critical role in}} establishment and maintenance of host defences, especially immune function (both within the gut and systemically) and gut barrier integrity. Moreover, plant fibers and polyphenols can influence the quantity of bile acids entering the distal ileum and colon, and also the profile of bile salt hydrolyzing bacteria therein, and thus may influence microbial involvement in the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids. Bile acids, apart from their role in regulating fat uptake are now being recognised for their important cell signalling role, acting as ligands for nuclear receptors like FXR, VDR, PXR, CAR and g-coupled receptors like TGR 5, which in turn regulate inflammation, glucose and lipid metabolism, nutrient absorption, intestinal permeability and thermogenesis. Gut bacteria also produce biologically active compounds like B vitamins (niacin and folate for example), vitamin K, and conjugated linoleic acids, all powerful bioactive agents targeting regulation of various inflammatory and metabolic pathways in man. Moreover, both the physiological concentrations of these compounds and their biological activity change throughout life, driven both by diet and successional development of the gut microbiota, identifying diet:microbe interactions as an important extra-genomic epigenetic mediator capable of impacting on physiological processes linked to chronic disease risk and the ageing process itself. Recent studies indicate that processes within the gut play a critical role in the persistent low grade systemic inflammation common to many chronic human diseases associated with modern diet and life-style. Increased intestinal permeability leads to translocation of inflammatory molecules such as lipopolysaccharide, which then act as continuous triggers for unresolved systemic inflammation. This intestinal permeability and emergence of aberrant microbiota profiles is strongly influenced by diet, with high fat - low fiber diets (the modern or Western style diet) contributing to gut wall permeability. Conversely, ancestral or traditional dietary patterns high in <b>fermentable</b> fiber, prebiotics, <b>fruit</b> and vegetables (and indeed certain probiotic or fermentative microorganisms) support microbiome structure and function and improve gut barrier integrity (Figure 1). A number of gut bacteria, including species of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli commonly used as probiotics, SCFA and the bile acid regulated nuclear receptor, FXR, have all been shown to control gut permeability via induction of tight junction proteins between epithelial cells. Similarly gut inflammation and oxidative damage play their part in gut “leakiness”, and are themselves impacted by both diet and the gut microbiome. Indeed, this diet induced intestinal damage and gut permeability, which is also characteristic of certain chronic disease states like obesity strongly mirrors the gut leakiness and chronic low grade systemic inflammation observed in the elderly, and at least in models of ageing, harbingers unresolved inflammation, metabolic derangement, diabetes and eventually death (Rena et al. 2012). Of course the ancients knew this all along - “death sits in the bowel” Hippocrates c. 400 BC. However, we are now providing the mechanistic understanding of how the gut microbiota may constitute a lynch-pin upon which the destructive degenerative processes of aberrant metabolic and inflammatory pathway activation are held at bay until overwhelmed by advancing age or aberrant diet. When this occurs, or what chronic disease expresses itself, is of course determined by host genetic predisposition, but it appears that diet:microbiota interactions in the gut contribute significantly to the environmental pressure driving these metabolic and inflammatory disease processes. Diet is one disease risk factor we can modify, and understanding on the one hand, what dietary components contribute to disease risk, and on the other hand, those which reduce disease risk is critical if we are to reduce the burden of chronic non-communicable diseases. Adherence to the Mediterranean style diet has been proven to protect against these chronic non-communicable diseases and improve mental well-being (Bonaccio et al. 2013) and indeed, recent studies are showing that components of the Mediterranean diet may mediate, at least part of their protective effects, through the gut microbiome (Figure 1, Tuohy and Del Rio, 2014). This lecture will provide an insight into recent studies illustrating how diet:microbe interactions in the gut not only contribute to chronic disease risk, but also hold great potential of reducing the socioeconomic impact of these diseases through rational modulation of dietary patterns throughout life...|$|R
