We find that at all India level 35 per cent of the rural households are asset poor, of which 22 per cent are chronically poor and 13 per cent are transient poor. An additional 9 per cent of rural non-poor households live under the threat of poverty. This article also analyses trends in asset poverty in various states, with policy recommendations based on their asset poverty status...|$|R

It then uses that standard to identify where national parliaments may be able to oversee the semester through their relationships to their own governments and where that solution may, conversely, be <b>insufficient.</b> The <b>article</b> <b>uses</b> that analysis to raise four questions. Firstly, what powers over the semester should be exericed by some parliament somewhere? Secondly, how should any parliamentary participation in the semester be distributed across European, national and even sub-national parliaments? Thirdly, how far should parliaments co-operate in their responses to the semester? Fourthly, how uniform across parliaments should participation in the semester be?
