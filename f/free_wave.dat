40|$|Accurate {{generation}} of the primary waves and the reproduction of the group-induced second-order low and high frequency waves have been considered essential for physical i. e. model test in the laboratory. In the laboratory when multi-chromatic primary waves are generated the required bounded waves will be generated naturally at the difference frequencies. In addition to that several unwanted <b>free</b> <b>waves</b> are also generated. The <b>free</b> <b>waves,</b> having the same frequencies of the bounded waves are reproduced due to mismatch of the boundary conditions at the wave paddle. The other two types of <b>free</b> <b>waves</b> are due to the wave paddle displacement and the local disturbances. We carried out physical experiments to identify the second order spurious waves in shallow water in the Offshore Engineering Basin (OEB) at the Institute for Ocean Technology (IOT) of National Research Council (NRC) Canada.

40|$|A joint {{experimental}} and analytical {{investigation of the}} sound transmission loss (STL) and two-dimensional <b>free</b> <b>wave</b> propagation in composite sandwich panels is presented here. An existing panel, a Nomex honeycomb sandwich panel, was studied in detail. For the purpose of understanding the typical behavior of sandwich panels, a composite structure comprising two aluminum sheets with a relatively soft, poro-elastic foam core was also constructed and studied. The cores of both panels were modeled using an anisotropic (transversely isotropic) poro-elastic material theory. ^ Several estimation methods were used to obtain the material properties of the honeycomb core and the skin plates {{to be used in}} the numerical calculations. Appropriate values selected from among the estimates were used in the STL and <b>free</b> <b>wave</b> propagation models. The prediction model was then verified in two ways: first, the calculated wave speeds and STL of a single poro-elastic layer were numerically verified by comparison with the predictions of a previously developed isotropic model. Secondly, to physically validate the transversely isotropic model, the measured STL and the phase speeds of the sandwich panels were compared with their predicted values. ^ To analyze the actual treatment of a fuselage structure, multi-layered configurations, including a honeycomb panel and several layers such as air gaps, acoustic blankets and membrane partitions, were formulated. Then, to find the optimal solution for improving the sound barrier performance of an actual fuselage system, air layer depth and glass fiber lining effects were investigated by using these multi-layer models. ^ By using the <b>free</b> <b>wave</b> propagation model, the first anti-symmetric and symmetric modes of the sandwich panels were characterized to allow the identification of the coincidence frequencies of the sandwich panel. The behavior of the STL could then be clearly explained by comparison with the <b>free</b> <b>wave</b> propagation solutions. By performing a parameter study based both on the STL and <b>free</b> <b>wave</b> propagation speeds, the mass, stiffness and damping-controlled regions of the STL were identified. The structural factors that can be adjusted to improve STL performance were also identified. ...|$|E
40|$|Flume {{measurements}} of a one-dimensional sliding hump starting from rest in quiescence fresh water indicate {{that when the}} hump travels at speed less than the shallow-water wave celerity, three waves emerge, travelling in two directions. One wave travels {{in the opposite direction}} to the sliding hump at approximately the shallow-water wave celerity (backward <b>free</b> <b>wave).</b> Another wave travels approximately in step with the hump (forced wave), and the remaining wave travels {{in the direction of the}} hump at approximately the shallow-water wave celerity (forward <b>free</b> <b>wave).</b> These experiments were completed for a range of sliding hump speed relative to the shallow-water wave celerity, up to unity of this ratio, to investigate possible derivation from solutions of the Euler equation with non-linear and non-hydrostatic terms being included or excluded. For the experimental arrangements tested, the forced waves were negative (depression or reduced water surface elevation) waves while the free waves were positive (bulges or increased water surface elevation). For experiments where the sliding hump travelled at less than 80 % of the shallow-water wave celerity did not include transient behaviour measurements (i. e. when the three waves still overlapped). The three wave framework was partially supported by these measurements in that the separated forward and forced waves were compared to measurements. For the laboratory scale experiments, the forward <b>free</b> <b>wave</b> height was predicted reasonably by the long-wave equation (ignoring non-linear and non-hydrostatic terms) when the sliding hump speed was less than 80 % of the shallow-water wave celerity. The forced wave depression magnitude required the Euler equations for all hump speed tested. The long-wave solution, while being valid in a limited parameter range, does predict the existence of the three waves as found in these experiments (forward travelling waves measured quantitatively while the backward travelling waves visually by video). Nevertheless, the forced wave transient development required non-linear and non-hydrostatic terms for higher sliding hump speeds. The forward <b>free</b> <b>wave,</b> controversially, does not need non-linear and non-hydrostatic terms until much higher hump speeds, suggesting that the forward <b>free</b> <b>wave</b> falls in the parameter space where long-wave equations apply whereas the forced wave more often falls into the parameter space requiring non-linear and non-hydrostatic terms. It does raise the question of why the forced wave transient dynamics does not impact on the initial transient dynamics where the forward <b>free</b> <b>wave</b> is in the long-wave theory, escaping the forced wave (at least for speeds less than 80 % of the shallow-water wave celerity) ...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe variability of infragravity frequency (0. 004 - 0. 04 Hz) motions {{on a wide}} continental shelf was examined with data from a 100 km long transect of bottom pressure recorders extending from the beach (6 m depth) to the shelf break (87 m depth) near Duck, North Carolina. The observed infragravity motions are a mixture of forced waves, phase coupled to local wave groups, and (uncoupled) <b>free</b> <b>waves.</b> Although the contribution of forced waves to the infragravity energy increases with both increasing swell energy and decreasing water depth, the shelf is usually dominated by <b>free</b> <b>waves.</b> The observed <b>free</b> <b>waves</b> are predominantly radiated from nearby beaches. The strong attenuation of infragravity waves observed across the inner shelf is primarily the result of refractive trapping and is well described by a WKB model.

At the deepest instrumented sites, weaker correlations between infragravity and swell energy levels, and weaker depth dependence of infragravity energy levels are observed, suggesting that remotely generated waves are important seaward of the shelf break.
