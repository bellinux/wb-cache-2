40|$|Problem: Chronic {{diseases}} (e. g., heart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes) are {{the leading}} causes {{of death in the}} United States. Controlling health risk behaviors (e. g., smoking, physical inactivity, poor diet, and excessive drinking) and using preventive health-care services (e. g., cancer, hypertension, and cholesterol screenings) can reduce morbidity and mortality from chronic diseases. Monitoring health-risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and preventive care practices is essential to develop health promotion activities, intervention programs, and health policies at the <b>state,</b> city, <b>and</b> county levels. Reporting Period Covered: January 2007 -December 2007 Description of the System: The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is a state-based, on-going, random-digit-dialed household telephone survey of noninstitutionalized adults aged => 18 years residing in the United States. BRFSS collects data on health-risk behaviors and use of preventative health services related to the leading causes of death and disability in the United States. This report presents results for 2007 <b>for</b> all 50 <b>states,</b> the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, 184 metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas (MMSAs), and 298 counties. Results: In 2007, prevalence estimates of risk behaviors, chronic conditions, and the use of preventive services varied substantially by <b>state</b> <b>and</b> territory, MMSA, and county. The following is a summary of results listed by BRFSS question topic. Each set of proportions refers to the range of estimated prevalence for the disease, condition, or behavior, as reported by the survey subject. Adults who reported fair or poor health: 11 % to 32 % <b>for</b> <b>states</b> <b>and</b> territories and 6 % to 31 % for MMSAs and counties. Adults with health-care coverage: 71 % to 94 % <b>for</b> <b>states</b> <b>and</b> territories and 51 % to 97 % for MMSAs and counties. Annual influenza vaccination among adults aged => 65 years: 32 % to 80 % <b>for</b> <b>states</b> <b>and</b> territories, 48 % to 83 % for MMSAs, and 44 % to 88 % for counties. Pneumococcal vaccination among adults aged => 65 years: 26 % to 74 % <b>for</b> <b>states</b> <b>and</b> territories, 44 % to 83 % for MMSAs, and 39 % to 87 % for counties. Adults who had their cholesterol checked within the preceding 5 years: 66 % to 85 % <b>for</b> <b>states</b> <b>and</b> territories and 58 % to 90 % for MMSAs and counties. Adults who consumed at least 5 servings of fruits and vegetables per day: 14 % to 33 % <b>for</b> <b>states</b> <b>and</b> territories, 16 % to 34 % for MMSAs and 14 % to 37 % for counties. Adults who reported no leisure-time physical activity: 17 % to 44 % <b>for</b> <b>states</b> <b>and</b> territories and 9 % to 38 % for MMSAs and counties. Adults who engaged in moderate or vigorous physical activity: 31 % to 61 % <b>for</b> <b>states</b> <b>and</b> territories and 36 % to 67 % for MMSAs and counties. Adults who engaged in only vigorous physical activity: 19 % to 40 % <b>for</b> <b>states</b> <b>and</b> territories and 15 % to 45 % for MMSAs and counties. Cigarette smoking among adults: 9 % to 31 % <b>for</b> <b>states</b> <b>and</b> territories, 7 % to 34 % for MMSAs, and 7 % to 30 % for counties. Binge drinking among adults: 3 % to 8 % <b>for</b> <b>states</b> <b>and</b> territories. Adults classified as overweight: 33 % to 40 % <b>for</b> <b>states</b> <b>and</b> territories and 26 % to 47 % for MMSAs and counties. Adults aged => 20 years who were obese: 20 % to 34 % <b>for</b> <b>states</b> <b>and</b> territories and 14 % to 38 % for MMSAs and counties. Adults who were told of a diabetes diagnosis: 5 % to 13 % <b>for</b> <b>states</b> <b>and</b> territories and 2 % to 17 % for MMSAs and counties. Adults with high blood pressure diagnosis: 21 % to 35 % <b>for</b> <b>states</b> <b>and</b> territories and 16 % to 38 % for MMSAs and counties. Adults who had high blood cholesterol: 28 % to 43 % <b>for</b> <b>states</b> <b>and</b> territories, 29 % to 49 % for MMSAs, and 26 % to 51 % for counties. Adults with a history of coronary heart disease: 2 % to 14 % <b>for</b> <b>states</b> <b>and</b> territories, MMSAs, and counties. Adults who were told of a stroke diagnosis: 1 % to 7 % <b>for</b> <b>states</b> <b>and</b> territories, MMSAs, and counties. Adults who were diagnosed with arthritis: 14 % to 36 % <b>for</b> <b>states</b> <b>and</b> territories and 16 % to 40 % for MMSAs and counties. Adults who had asthma: 5 % to 10 % <b>for</b> <b>states</b> <b>and</b> territories and 3 % to 13 % for MMSAs and counties. Adults with activity limitation associated with physical, mental, or emotional problems: 10 % to 26 % <b>for</b> <b>states</b> <b>and</b> territories. Adults who required special equipment because of health problems: 3 % to 10 % <b>for</b> <b>states</b> <b>and</b> territories and 3 % to 14 % for MMSAs and counties. Interpretation: The findings in this report indicate substantial variation in self-reported health status, health-care coverage, use of preventive health-care services, health behaviors leading to chronic health conditions, and disability among U. S. adults at the <b>state</b> <b>and</b> territory, MMSA, and county levels. The findings underscore the continued need for surveillance of health-risk behaviors, chronic diseases and conditions, and the use of preventive services. Public Health Actions: Healthy People 2010 (HP 2010) objectives have been established to monitor health behaviors and the use of preventive health services. Local <b>and</b> <b>state</b> health departments <b>and</b> federal agencies use BRFSS data to identify populations at high risk for certain health behaviors, chronic diseases and conditions and to evaluate the use of preventive services. In addition, BRFSS data are used to direct, implement, monitor, and evaluate public health programs and policies that can lead to a reduction in morbidity and mortality.

That convention endorsed McKinley for president and Foraker for Senate, and nominated Foraker supporters <b>for</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> party offices, including Asa Bushnell to succeed McKinley as governor. McKinley realized that it would be risky to have a faction hostile to the presidential candidate within his home state, and sought an alliance, campaigning for Bushnell and for a Republican legislature that would send Foraker to Washington. The voters chose Bushnell and gave the state Republicans a large majority in the legislature. In January 1896, Foraker was overwhelmingly elected (to take office in March 1897), and McKinley gained Foraker's agreement to support him for president, assuring party political peace at home.|$|E
