40|$|Eye {{alignment}} to {{the optical}} system is very critical in many modern devices, such as for biometrics, gaze tracking, head mounted displays, and health. We show alignment {{in the context}} of the most difficult challenge: retinal imaging. Alignment in retinal imaging, even conducted by a physician, is very challenging due to precise alignment requirements and lack of direct user eye gaze control. Self-imaging of the retina is nearly impossible. We frame this problem as a user-interface (UI) challenge. We can create a better UI by controlling the <b>eye</b> <b>box</b> of a projected cue. Our key concept is to exploit the reciprocity, "If you see me, I see you", to develop near eye alignment displays. Two technical aspects are critical: a) tightness of the <b>eye</b> <b>box</b> and (b) the <b>eye</b> <b>box</b> discovery comfort. We demonstrate that previous pupil forming display architectures are not adequate to address alignment in depth. We then analyze two ray-based designs to determine efficacious fixation patterns. These ray based displays and a sequence of user steps allow lateral (x, y) and depth (z) wise alignment to deal with image centering and focus. We show a highly portable prototype and demonstrate the effectiveness through a user study. Vodafone Americas FoundationUnited States.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the development and}} construction of a large screen version of the Cambridge time-multiplexed autostereo display. The new device uses a 50 inch diagonal spherical mirror {{in place of the}} 10 inch Fresnel lens of the original Cambridge colour display. A fivefold increase in image luminance has been achieved by the replacement of sequential colour on a single CRT with separate red, green, and blue CRTs. Fifteen views are displayed at 640480 (VGA) resolution with about 250 cd/m 2 luminance and 30 Hz (TV) interlaced refresh rate. A 22 mm inter-view separation provides three views between a typical viewer's eyes, giving a smooth stereoscopic effect over a 330 mm wide <b>eye</b> <b>box.</b> Two identical optical systems have been built, sharing the single large spherical mirror, allowing simultaneous use of the device by two viewers. The two systems are off-axis with respect to the main mirror, requiring geometric compensation on the CRTs in addition to the normal colour convergence. The prot [...] ...|$|E

This paper {{investigates the}} {{recognition}} of the Eye Accessing Cues (EACs) used in Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) and shows how computer vision techniques can be used for understanding the mean-ing of non-visual gaze directions. Any specific EAC is identified by the relative position of the iris within the <b>eye</b> bounding <b>box,</b> which is deter-mined from modified versions of the classical integral projections. The eye cues are inferred via a logistic classifier from features extracted within the <b>eye</b> bounding <b>box.</b> The here proposed solution is shown to outperform in terms of detection rate other classical approaches...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{recognition}} of the Eye Accessing Cues (EACs) used in the Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) as a method for inferring one’s thinking mecha-nisms, since the meaning of non-visual gaze directions may be directly related to the in-ternal mental processes. The direction of gaze is identified by separating the compo-nents of the eye (i. e. iris, sclera and surround-ing skin) followed by retrieving the relative position of the iris within the <b>eye</b> bounding <b>box,</b> that was previously extracted from an eye landmarks localizer. The eye cues are re-trieved via a logistic classifier from features that describe the typical regions within the <b>eye</b> bounding <b>box.</b> The simultaneous investi-gation of both eyes, as well as the eye tracking over consecutive frames are shown to increase the overall performance. The here proposed solution is tested on four databases proving to have superior performance when compared in terms of recognition rate with methods re-lying on state of the art algorithms. 1...|$|R
40|$|Cubomedusae (box jellyfish) {{possess a}} {{remarkable}} visual system with 24 eyes distributed in four sensory structures termed rhopalia. Each rhopalium {{is equipped with}} six eyes: two pairs of pigment cup eyes and two unpaired lens eyes. Each eye type probably captures specific features of the visual environment. To investigate whether multiple types of photoreceptor cells {{are present in the}} rhopalium, and whether the different eye types possess different types of photoreceptors, we have used immunohistochemistry with a range of vertebrate opsin antibodies to label the photoreceptors, and electroretinograms (ERG) to determine their spectral sensitivity. All photoreceptor cells of the two lens <b>eyes</b> of the <b>box</b> jellyfish Tripedalia cystophora and Carybdea marsupialis displayed immunoreactivity for an antibody directed against the zebrafish ultraviolet (UV) opsin, but not against any of eight other rhodopsin or cone opsin antibodies tested. In neither of the two species were the pigment cup eyes immunoreactive for any of the opsin antibodies. ERG analysis of the Carybdea lower lens eyes demonstrated a single spectral sensitivity maximum at 485 nm suggesting the presence of a single opsin type. Our data demonstrate that the lens <b>eyes</b> of <b>box</b> jellyfish utilize a single opsin and are thus color-blind, and that there is probably a different photopigment in the pigment cup eyes. The results support our hypothesis that the lens eyes and the pigment cup <b>eyes</b> of <b>box</b> jellyfish are involved in different and specific visual tasks...|$|R

The power pills {{temporarily}} make the character invulnerable to the ghosts, and a distinctive sound effect is made after they are eaten. During this time, the ghosts turn a purplish blue color and Pac-Man can eat the ghosts for additional points, after which the ghosts return to the center <b>box</b> as <b>eyes</b> and respawn. When the <b>eyes</b> reach the <b>box,</b> they stay there until the power pill elapses. After this happens, the eyes respawn and the ghosts exit the box.

50|$|The {{interior}} of the King's was designed by J.D. Swanston, a Kirkcaldy architect with many fine theatres to his credit. As you enter the foyers, an arrangement of mahogany, heavily carved door frames, stained glass, pilasters with marble and parquet floors greets you. The auditorium originally had seating for 2,500, with tip up seats in the stalls and circles, and upholstered benches with metal arm rests in the top Balcony. After a number of alterations the auditorium now seats 1,350, just over half the original capacity. The design in the auditorium is a feast for the <b>eyes.</b> The <b>boxes</b> are arranged over 3 levels, and are tiered neatly {{on top of each}} other. The sightlines in the theatre were poor as the architects were not as experienced as others in the same field. Some of the boxes had abysmal views of the stage, and the Balcony looked out on the plasterwork above the proscenium rather than the stage itself. These were however, small criticisms as the theatre's qualities far outweighed the faults.|$|R
