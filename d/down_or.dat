5|$|Because the {{ingredients}} of this equation, the arc length, curvature, and time, are all unaffected by translations and rotations of the Euclidean plane, {{it follows that the}} flow defined by this equation is invariant under translations and rotations (or more precisely, equivariant). If the plane is scaled by a constant dilation factor, the flow remains essentially unchanged, but is slowed <b>down</b> <b>or</b> sped up by the same factor.|$|E
5|$|During its lifetime, {{a nucleus}} may be broken <b>down</b> <b>or</b> destroyed, {{either in the}} process of cell {{division}} or as a consequence of apoptosis (the process of programmed cell death). During these events, the structural components of the nucleus — the envelope and lamina — can be systematically degraded.|$|E
5|$|Ganesha is {{a popular}} figure in Indian art. Unlike those of some deities, {{representations}} of Ganesha show wide variations and distinct patterns changing over time. He may be portrayed standing, dancing, heroically taking action against demons, playing with his family as a boy, sitting <b>down</b> <b>or</b> on an elevated seat, or engaging {{in a range of}} contemporary situations.|$|E

5|$|In 1707, the Acts of Union merged England and Scotland, and Lismore {{became part}} of the United Kingdom of Great Britain. Thereafter taxes on whisky {{distillation}} rose dramatically, and much of Scotland's distillation was either shut <b>down</b> <b>or</b> forced underground until the 1823 Excise Act provided a legal framework for the industry. The remains of at least two illicit stills from this period have been found on Lismore.|$|E
5|$|In March 2016 {{the route}} to Oslo was closed down. The {{operator}} was Air Norway at this time. This leaves charter flights as the only traffic, and big uncertainty whether the airport should be closed <b>down</b> <b>or</b> not. The road travel time to Oslo Airport is around 2 hours 30 minutes, which is planned to be shortened by 15 minutes by 2025.|$|E
5|$|JMP {{software}} is partly focused on exploratory data analysis and visualization. It {{is designed for}} users to investigate data to learn something unexpected, as opposed to confirming a hypothesis. JMP links statistical data to graphics representing them, so users can drill <b>down</b> <b>or</b> up to explore the data and various visual representations of it. Its primary applications are for designed experiments and analyzing statistical data from industrial processes.|$|E

5|$|Most of the time, goalkeepers do low-intensity work (treading water {{without too}} much effort) but when they do work (for example, {{when they have a}} man <b>down</b> <b>or</b> are in the ready position) it is very intense.|$|E
5|$|The He 111Z's {{operational}} {{history was}} minimal. One machine {{was caught by}} RAF fighter aircraft over France on 14 March 1944. The He 111Z was towing a Gotha Go 242, and was shot down. Eight were shot <b>down</b> <b>or</b> destroyed {{on the ground in}} 1944.|$|E
5|$|The Vought OS2U Kingfisher was {{a lightly}} armed two-man {{aircraft}} designed in 1937. The Kingfisher's high operating ceiling of 13,000 feet (nearly four kilometers) made it well-suited for its primary mission: {{to observe the}} fall of shot from a battleship's guns and radio corrections back to the ship. The floatplanes used in World War II also performed search and rescue for naval aviators who were shot <b>down</b> <b>or</b> forced to ditch in the ocean.|$|E

The Courier must also either {{convince}} both General Oliver and the Legate to step <b>down,</b> <b>or</b> they can kill them. The Courier and Yes Man eventually take control of Hoover Dam, while ensuring New Vegas's independence.|$|E
5|$|Agonistic {{behaviour}} typically {{consists of}} squabbles between individuals climbing over or passing each other. This occasionally involves biting. Males that are strangers may wrestle, chase, and bite each other. In extreme situations, a male {{may try to}} displace a smaller rival from a tree. This involves the larger aggressor climbing up and attempting to corner the victim, which tries either to rush past him and climb <b>down</b> <b>or</b> {{to move to the}} end of a branch. The aggressor attacks by grasping the target by the shoulders and repeatedly biting him. Once the weaker individual is driven away, the victor bellows and marks the tree. Pregnant and lactating females are particularly aggressive and attack individuals that come too close. In general, however, koalas tend to avoid energy-wasting aggressive behaviour.|$|E

5|$|The tornado took a {{path through}} Rockland, Westchester, and Fairfield counties, <b>downing</b> <b>or</b> {{uprooting}} thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closets warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1million in damage.|$|R
50|$|An EF1 tornado {{passed through}} {{downtown}} Longview, Washington, on a Thursday afternoon. A survey team from NWS Portland reported {{the damage was}} more than 1 mi long and 200 ft wide. The tornado caused roof and automobile damage, <b>downed</b> <b>or</b> snapped trees, and felled power poles.|$|R
5|$|Although {{set in a}} hospital, it uses {{no medical}} storylines; the action is {{produced}} {{by a series of}} soap opera-style twists and turns in the personal lives of the characters. They proceed through a series of often absurd sketch-like scenes, or by sequences where the film is slowed <b>down</b> <b>or</b> sped up, often emphasizing the body language of the characters. The show had eight writers. Two series were made by the Talkback Thames production company for Channel 4.|$|E
5|$|In many organisms, inhibitors may act {{as part of}} a {{feedback}} mechanism. If {{an enzyme}} produces too much of one substance in the organism, that substance may act as an inhibitor for the enzyme {{at the beginning of the}} pathway that produces it, causing production of the substance to slow <b>down</b> <b>or</b> stop when there is sufficient amount. This is a form of negative feedback. Major metabolic pathways such as the citric acid cycle make use of this mechanism.|$|E
5|$|In match race mode, {{the player}} competes {{in a series}} of races against AI-controlled snowboarders. The game times the player {{throughout}} the level and players receive a damage meter which fills if the snowboarder falls <b>down</b> <b>or</b> is knocked over. The difficulty level in match races can be set to easy, medium, or hard, adjusting the complexity and number of races. If the player fails at defeating an AI competitor, they must retire. The player is given three chances to beat the computer before the game is over.|$|E
50|$|Until recently, Andamooka townsfolk {{had to rely}} {{on water}} {{supplies}} trucked in from Roxby <b>Downs,</b> <b>or</b> above ground cisterns for the limited rainfall of the region. A pipeline to the township has since been built, although water still has to be trucked to the town's water tanks.|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} the war, {{more than}} 12,000 {{citizens}} from France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, had participated in rescue and escape efforts for Allied forces. By the Allied D-Day landings in June 1944 in Normandy, more than 4,000 <b>downed</b> <b>or</b> captured airmen and POWs escaped occupied Europe.|$|R
50|$|For {{the most}} part, Houston escaped major damage, apart from {{extensive}} power interruptions. A few windows blew {{out of some}} downtown skyscrapers, and some trees and traffic signals were <b>downed</b> <b>or</b> damaged. Thirty one deaths in Harris County were attributed to Rita, mostly related to the evacuation and cleanup.|$|R
5|$|In the Battle of Britain, Mayer often {{flew over}} the English Channel as the wingman of Helmut Wick. He claimed three further {{victories}} in this campaign, all over Royal Air Force (RAF) Supermarine Spitfires, but was himself shot <b>down</b> <b>or</b> forced to land at the French Coast. Once he had to swim in the Channel for an hour before he was rescued. At the end of 1940 Mayer had four victories to his credit and JG2 was withdrawn from combat to replenish the heavy losses it had sustained. Following a short tour as fighter pilot instructor at the Jagdfliegerschule (fighter pilot school) in Werneuchen, Mayer {{was sent back to}} the Channel Front.|$|E
5|$|It {{is only as}} {{a result}} of {{accurately}} maintaining the composition of the 3 litres alveolar air that, with each breath, some carbon dioxide is discharged into the atmosphere and some oxygen is taken up from the outside air. If more carbon dioxide than usual has been lost by a short period of hyperventilation, breathing will be slowed <b>down</b> <b>or</b> halted until the alveolar partial pressure of carbon dioxide has returned to 5.3kPa (40mmHg). The opposite occurs after breath-holding.|$|E
5|$|Large wolf populations {{limit the}} numbers of small to {{medium-sized}} felines. Wolves encounter cougars along portions of the Rocky Mountains and adjacent mountain ranges. Wolves and cougars typically avoid encountering each other by hunting on different elevations. In winter, however, when snow accumulation forces their prey into valleys, interactions between the two species become more likely. Wolves in packs usually dominate cougars and can steal kills. They have been reported killing mothers and their kittens. Wolves hunt steppe cats, and may scavenge from snow leopard kills. Wolves may also reduce Eurasian lynx populations. Wolves may kill lynxes by running them <b>down,</b> <b>or</b> killing them before they can escape into trees. Similar reports of encounters between wolves and bobcats have been documented.|$|E
50|$|Tannehill {{finished}} the 2009 {{season with a}} team-leading 46 receptions for 609 yards and four touchdowns. About 80% of his 46 catches went for first <b>downs</b> <b>or</b> touchdowns. He picked up All-Big 12 Honorable Mention honors for his performance. He only took eight snaps at quarterback the entire season.|$|R
5000|$|If an {{attempted}} field goal is missed it {{is treated as}} a punt, normally {{it would be a}} touchback and the opposing team will start at the 20-yard line. However, if it does not enter the end zone, it can be <b>downed</b> <b>or</b> returned as a normal punt.|$|R
