5|$|A {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for Bermuda on August27 but swiftly canceled {{the next day}} as Danielle steered well clear of the island. Swells from the powerful hurricane reached the East Coast of the United States, leading to the rescues of 250 people <b>in</b> <b>Ocean</b> City, Maryland and an additional 70 people {{off the coast of}} Central Florida. The body of a man—whose death appeared to have been from drowning—was pulled from the waters of Satellite Beach, Florida; a second man went missing <b>in</b> <b>Ocean</b> City, but his body was never recovered and the search was eventually called off. Researchers examining the wreckage of RMS Titanic were forced to seek refuge in St. John's, Newfoundland; swells as large as 10ft (3m) impacted the coastline of Newfoundland.|$|E

5|$|October 8–9, 2016– While Hurricane Matthew did {{not make}} {{landfall}} in the state, the storm still brought rain and gusty winds to the state due to its large size.

5|$|September 25, 1992– Tropical Storm Danielle makes {{landfall}} on the Delmarva Peninsula, producing {{winds of}} 53mph (85km/h) <b>in</b> <b>Ocean</b> City. Storm tide ranges from an estimated storm tide of 2–3feet (0.6–0.9m). The storm produces moderate rainfall of over 3inches (76mm) across the Eastern Shore of Maryland.|$|E
5|$|September 3, 2016– Tropical Storm Hermine {{affected}} {{the majority of}} the Eastern Shore with heavy rainfall and high winds, prompting tropical storm warnings to be put up.

5|$|The cliffs on {{the ocean}} side of the {{peninsula}} are sheer and are undergoing constant erosion due to wave action. On the east side the land slopes into San Diego Bay more gradually, so that homes and developments {{go right to the}} water's edge.

5|$|Tropical Storm Danielle dropped light {{rainfall}} {{across much}} of New Jersey, with some areas in the southwestern portion of the state experiencing over 3inches (76mm). Strong waves from the storm washed out miles of beaches along the coastline. <b>In</b> <b>Ocean</b> City, the waves passed over the boardwalk and into houses. Further north, the waves crashed a four-person, 35-foot (10-m) sailboat near Island Beach State Park. Two managed to swim safely to shore, though the other two occupants drowned.|$|E
5|$|Agnew {{remained}} fit {{and active}} into his seventies, playing golf and tennis regularly. On Wednesday, September 17, 1996, he {{was due to}} play tennis with a friend, but collapsed at his summer home <b>in</b> <b>Ocean</b> City the night before, and {{was taken to the}} hospital where he died the next day. The cause of death was acute leukemia, previously undiagnosed. The funeral, at Timonium, Maryland, was mainly confined to family; Buchanan and some of Agnew's former Secret Service guards also attended to pay their final respects. In recognition of his service as vice president, an honor guard of the combined military services fired a 21-gun salute at the graveside. Agnew's wife Judith survived him by 16 years, dying at Rancho Mirage on June 20, 2012.|$|E

5|$|An amateur, near shot-for-shot remake {{was made}} by Chris Strompolos, Eric Zala, and Jayson Lamb, then {{children}} <b>in</b> <b>Ocean</b> Springs, Mississippi. It took the boys seven years to finish, from 1982 to 1989. After production of the film, called , it was shelved and forgotten until 2003, where it was discovered by Eli Roth and acclaimed by Spielberg himself, who congratulated the boys on their hard work and said {{he looked forward to}} seeing their names on the big screen. Scott Rudin and Paramount Pictures purchased the trio's life rights with the goal of producing a film based on their adventures making their remake.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{there have}} been {{cyclical}} ice ages in which glacial sheets periodically covered the higher latitudes of the continents. Ice ages may occur because of changes <b>in</b> <b>ocean</b> circulation and continentality induced by plate tectonics. The Milankovitch theory predicts that glacial periods occur during ice ages because of astronomical factors in combination with climate feedback mechanisms. The primary astronomical drivers are a higher than normal orbital eccentricity, a low axial tilt (or obliquity), and the alignment of summer solstice with the aphelion. Each of these effects occur cyclically. For example, the eccentricity changes over time cycles of about 100,000 and 400,000 years, with the value ranging from less than 0.01 up to 0.05. This is equivalent to a change of the semiminor axis of the planet's orbit from 99.95% of the semimajor axis to 99.88%, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Hodad's is a {{small chain}} of {{hamburger}} restaurants in San Diego, United States, established in 1973 by husband and wife Byron and Virginia Hardin, who operated from a single burger stand until 1979.
