25|$|The most {{significant}} initial alteration {{to the original}} text was to conflate the four plays into a trilogy. This was not unprecedented, as adaptations from the seventeenth century onwards had employed truncation when staging the sequence, especially the Henry VI trilogy. In 1681, John Crowne adapted 2 Henry VI and 3 Henry VI into a two-part play called Henry the Sixth, The First Part and The Misery of Civil War. Henry the Sixth comprised Acts 1–3 of 2 Henry VI, with material added by Crowne himself, focusing mainly {{on the death of}} Gloucester, whilst Misery adapted the last two acts of 2 Henry VI and a shortened version of 3 Henry VI. In 1699, Colley Cibber's The Tragical History of King Richard the Third used scenes from 3 Henry VI as a form of prologue to rest of the play, establishing a tradition still in use in <b>filmic</b> <b>adaptations</b> of Richard III (see, for example, James Keane and André Calmettes's 1912 version, Laurence Olivier's 1955 version or Richard Loncraine's 1995 version). In 1723, Theophilus Cibber's King Henry VI: A Tragedy used Act 5 of 2 Henry VI and Acts 1 and 2 of 3 Henry VI. In 1817, J.H. Merivale's Richard Duke of York; or the Contention of York and Lancaster used material from all three Henry VI plays, but removed everything not directly related to York. Robert Atkins adapted all three plays into a single piece for a performance at The Old Vic in 1923 as part of the celebrations for the tercentenary of the First Folio. In 1957, also at The Old Vic, Douglas Seale directed a production of the trilogy under the title The Wars of the Roses. Adapted by Barry Jackson, the trilogy was again altered to a two-part play; 1 Henry VI and 2 Henry VI were combined (with almost all of 1 Henry VI eliminated) and 3 Henry VI was performed in a shortened version.|$|E
50|$|Stam {{has also}} been a major figure within the “transtextual turn” in {{adaptation}} and intertextuality studies. Stam’s later work in literature and film formed part of and helped advance the field of adaptation studies, which has been undergoing a boom {{since the turn of the}} 21st century. Stam’s essay “Beyond Fidelity,” included in the James Naremore 1999 anthology Film Adaptation, called for a larger paradigm shift in which authors like Naremore, Dudley Andrews, Kamilla Elliot, Deborah Cartmell, Imelda Whelehan, Thomas Leitch, Jack Boozer, Christine Geraghty, Alessandra Raengo, and Linda Hutcheon moved from a binary novel-film fidelity approach to a more open transtextual approach. The interest in film-literature relations culminated in two monographs and two anthologies. Literature through Film: Realism, Magic, and the Art of Adaptation (Blackwell, 2005) offered a historicized account of key trends in the history of the novel - the proto-magic realism of a Cervantes, the colonialist realism of a Defoe (and his critics), the parodic reflexivity of a Henry Fielding or Machado de Assis, or proto-cinematic perspectivalism of a Flaubert, the neurotic narrators of a Dostoyevsky or a Nabokov, the feminist experimentations of Clarice Lispector and Marguerite Duras, and the “marvelous latin-american real” of Mario de Andrade and Alejo Carpentier, all as seen through the many <b>filmic</b> <b>adaptations</b> - both “faithful” and revisionist - of their work. Francois Truffaut and Friends: Modernism, Sexuality, and Adaptation (Rutgers, 2006), meanwhile, explored the “transtextual diaspora” generated by a highly literary ménage-a-trois in the 1920s that led to the books and published journals of Henri-Pierre Roche, Franz Hessel and Helen Hessel, as well as three films by Truffaut based on the life and work of Roche (Jules and Jim, Two Englishwomen, and The Man Who Loved Women). Two anthologies co-edited with Alessandra Raengo (both published by Blackwell) fleshed out the project: Literature and Film: A Guide to the Theory and Practice of Adaptation (Blackwell, 2005), and Companion to Literature and Film (Blackwell, 2004).|$|E

Adapted by Barry Jackson, the trilogy was again altered to a two-part play; 1 Henry VI and 2 Henry VI were combined (with almost all of 1 Henry VI eliminated) and 3 Henry VI was performed in a shortened version. John Barton's adaptation would divide the plays up in a new way. The first play (Henry VI) featured a shortened version of 1 Henry VI and roughly half of 2 Henry VI (up to the death of Cardinal Beaufort). The second play (Edward IV) featured the second half of 2 Henry VI and a shortened version of 3 Henry VI. This was followed by a shortened version of Richard III as the third play. In all, 1,450 lines written by Barton were added to roughly 6,000 lines of original Shakespearean material, with a total of 12,350 lines removed. Barton defended the controversial decision to cut from and add to the text {{on the grounds that the}} Henry VI plays [...] "are not viable as they stand," [...] arguing they needed to be adapted [...] "in the interests of audience accessibility." [...] As an example of the alterations, in the original text, the character of the Duke of Exeter appears only in 1 Henry VI, whereas in The Wars of the Roses, he appears throughout all three plays, as a constant ally of Henry VI and the House of Lancaster. Numerous characters were also removed, such as Warwick's father, the Earl of Salisbury, a major character in 2 Henry VI, and some of the battle scenes were amalgamated to cut down on stage combat (such as the First Battle of St Albans and the Battle of Wakefield, which take place in 2 Henry VI and 3 Henry VI, respectively).|$|E

40|$|The {{idea for}} this thesis {{first came to}} light while {{teaching}} my first year students the novel The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas. I was asked why they had to read the novel when a film had already been made. In today‘s fast-paced society, many people rely on films rather than the written word yet, {{for the purposes of}} the Irish State Examinations, students need to have a deep insight of the written text at hand. Throughout this thesis, I will argue the importance of utilizing <b>filmic</b> <b>adaptations</b> within the classroom while at the same time highlighting the importance of the limitations of this medium. Adaptations are not mirror images of the source text. Directors, scriptwriters, producers and actors all put their own indelible mark on a film and therefore can often change the meaning, story or characters. To rely solely on this medium would drastically effect a student‘s understanding and learning of a particular text. I intend to use four primary texts and their filmic counterparts; To Kill a Mockingbird, The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas, Romeo and Juliet and Hamlet. I will also discuss a range of novels, plays and films to emphasise the importance of seeing the process of adaptation as a genre and recognising the filmic adaptation as a new text. I will look at the intricate nature of adaptation and explore the reasons for inclusions and omissions whilst adapting a literary work. In the Introduction, I will look at the current situation of adaptations and how a literary work is adapted. In Chapter One, I will focus predominately on The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas and its filmic counterpart directed by Mark Herman. Chapter Two will explore To Kill a Mockingbird and the filmic adaptation directed by Robert Mulligan. Chapter Three will look at William Shakespeare‘s play Hamlet and <b>filmic</b> <b>adaptations</b> by Franco Zeffirelli and Kenneth Branagh. Chapter Four will explore Romeo and Juliet and <b>filmic</b> <b>adaptations</b> by Baz Luhrmann and Franco Zeffirelli.

40|$|This senior thesis paper {{discusses}} {{the representation of}} masculinity and heroism in post- 9 / 11 culture and how <b>filmic</b> <b>adaptations</b> of graphic novels have helped to shape these representations. Following the events of September 11 th, the cultural definitions of the masculine hero shifted, allowing the average, working class man to become the embodiment of American heroism. This new understanding of the American hero was marked by sexual difference and a redefinition of the masculine “hard-body” that allowed for the possession of a heroic masculine identity to appear more attainable. This thesis primarily examines the <b>filmic</b> <b>adaptations</b> of works by Frank Miller and Alan Moore in order to track these changes in masculinity and to observe how these films have helped to define new perceptions of masculinity and heroism. In the chapter that {{discusses the}} adaptations of Frank Miller’s work, I focus on the films Sin City (Rodriguez 2 ̆ 6 Miller, 2005) and 300 (Snyder, 2006) to argue that Miller’s conservative viewpoints and his problematic representations of gender help to inform contemporary understandings of masculinity and heroism and that the film adaptations of his work maintain these ideologies.

While some of aspects of these films aspire to move outside the realm of post- 9 / 11 gender representations, I argue that the cultural understandings of masculinity and heroism force these films to remain part of America’s conservative cultural narrative that is based on traditional values...|$|E

Working within the filmic fairy tale adaptation cycle that emerged between 2005 and 2015, this thesis investigates how girlhood is cinematically constructed {{through the lens of}} fantasy, in relation to gendered representation in media. The relationship between femininity and fairy tales is well-established. By reading contemporary <b>filmic</b> <b>adaptations</b> of the tales, the thesis deconstructs gendered myth-making and reveals the extent to which fairy tale imagery and plot continue to inform cultural constructions of girlhood. It argues that by centring upon young female protagonists and often targeting a young female audience, this cycle constitutes a newly emerging young woman’s cinema. In doing so, the thesis relates the contemporary fairy tale adaptation cycle back to gendered histories of media and genres traditionally associated with female audiences (such as the Female Gothic, the Melodrama, the Costume Drama and so on). The thesis analyses their similar narrative strategies of using iconographical objects, haunted spaces and evocative settings. The cycle’s cultural denigration is critiqued for its association with mainstream and primarily female audiences. The act of adapting fairy tales to construct girlhood through fantasy thus necessitates exploring the ideological implications of gendered genres, their narrative strategies as well as complex processes of adaptation, from tale to screen. How these films, by centralising girlhood, explore female fantasies and desires, trauma, gendered violence and coming of age, is explored throughout. The thesis argues that a highly specific mode of girlhood comes to the fore in this cycle, within particular cultural (social, racial and narrative) parameters. This mode of fairy tale girlhood is imperilled, spectacular and exclusionary, generating disturbing implications of how young women are represented and addressed in popular media. As in women’s films of previous eras in film history, however, the fairy tale adaptation cycle both reinforces and challenges the rigid parameters in which girlhood is cinematically imagined.

The artistic re-creations of fairy-tale plots and characters in film—the parodies, the aesthetic experimentation, and the mixing of genres to engender new insights into art and life— mirror possibilities of estranging ourselves from designated roles, along with the conventional patterns of the classical tales. ” Here, scholars from film, folklore, and cultural studies move discussion beyond the well-known Disney movies to the many other <b>filmic</b> <b>adaptations</b> of fairy tales and to {{the widespread use of}} fairy tale tropes, themes, and motifs in cinema.

40|$|In this interview, Roddy Doyle, one of {{the most}} popular {{contemporary}} writers in Ireland, provides insightful comments on crucial aspects of his writing career. Doyle speaks about the beginning of his literary adventure, the creative process of his work, and his artistic influences, as well as his feeling of pride in being a native Dubliner. Furthermore, he addresses his experience of the Celtic Tiger era in Ireland and the multicultural reality of the country in the late 1990 s. Doyle’s detailed discussion of the female characters in his work is {{one of the}} most intriguing parts of the interview. He also gives hints about his latest novel The Guts (2013) and talks about the shift in theme, to the middle-age crisis in men, in his recent work: The Bullfighting (2011), Two Pints (2012), and The Guts (2013). His ideas about the <b>filmic</b> <b>adaptations</b> of his work, his favourite writers and his favourite fictional female characters are other inspiring points of the interview. The interview closes with Doyle’s characterization of the Post-Celtic Tiger period in Ireland and his views about the shifting portraits of Irish men and women...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the difference between}} Jane Austen s first published novel, Sense and Sensibility (1811), and two <b>filmic</b> <b>adaptations</b> by Ang Lee (1995) and Rodney Bennet (1985). The main emphasis is on narrative techniques and how these are employed differently in the two media. Naturally, an adaptation from one medium to another causes alterations in the original storyline. A visual medium can never duplicate a written text completely. An author s choice of narrative techniques {{is influenced by the}} context s/he is writing in, and by the message(s) s/he is trying to communicate to his or her readers. Through a narrative interpretation of Austen s novel, I have tried to define the thematic implications that her choice of narrative techniques constitutes. My analysis focuses mainly on the narrator and the characters, which I consider the most important narrative tools an author has. The comparison between the novel and the films considers the directors choices; how these influence the storyline and why they are necessary. I argue that a filmic adaptation is also influenced by the time in which it is made, and the message(s) the director wishes to communicate to the viewers...|$|E
40|$|In {{his article}} "Conscience's De Leeuw van Vlaanderen (The Lion of Flanders) and Its Adaptation to Film by Claus" Gertjan Willems {{discusses}} Hugo Claus's 1984 <b>filmic</b> <b>adaptation</b> of Hendrik Conscience's 1838 historical novel, a landmark {{in the history}} of the Flemish Movement. Willems's analysis is executed by means of a textual film analysis and archival research. Willems pays special attention to the Flemish-Dutch coproduction's complex relations with the national question. Despite various difficulties concerning Flemish nationalist sensitivities of the project, the producers wanted the film to be as faithful as possible to Conscience's novel. This resulted in an overtly romantic and Flemish nationalist production despite some counterpoints introduced by the controversial and critical director Claus. Although De Leeuw van Vlaanderen was the most expensive production in Belgium's film history, it turned out to be an unprecedented critical and commercial failure...|$|R
40|$|Hélène Cixous’s liminal text ‘The Laugh of the Medusa’ {{calls for}} a {{challenge}} of traditional representations of femininity and prompts women to inscribe their hitherto concealed femininity into the world. Depicting the love, relationship and loss experienced by two female characters, Julie Maroh’s 2010 Blue Is the Warmest Color provides a narrative sustained by a reclaimed matrixial gaze that challenges patriarchal definitions of women. Whereas the original comic book acts in concert with Cixous’s perspective and seeks to assert the infinite richness of women’s individual constitutions, the 2013 film adaptation by Abdellatif Kechiche presents a different economy. This article analyses how, in contrast to Maroh’s original, the <b>filmic</b> <b>adaptation</b> discounts the feminine stance, develops a heteronormalised take on the same story and could therefore be read as promoting heteronormative leitmotifs and fantasised clichés of lesbian subjectivity and sexuality...|$|R
40|$|The {{literary}} {{adaptations of}} canonical novels for film provide a unique repository of both identity contents and socio-cultural observations {{which can be}} revisited through the filmic representations. These recreations symbolize not only a privileged visual interpretation of a nation, but they also allow us to examine how a given society reflects itself through the fiction. In this sense, {{the objective of this}} paper is to reflect upon the Portuguese updated <b>filmic</b> <b>adaptation</b> of The Crime of Father Amaro (1880) by the canonical author Eça de Queiroz. On one hand, the author intends to rethink about the Portuguese identity portrayed by the film and, at the same time, the author manages to observe how the Portuguese society is revealed. On the other hand, the paper aims to analyze the particular process of the adaptation of The Crime of Father Amaro following a qualitative methodology...|$|R
