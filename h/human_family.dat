5|$|Robotron is a 2D {{multi-directional}} shooter game {{in which}} the player controls the on-screen protagonist from a top-down perspective. The game {{is set in the}} year 2084 in a fictional world where robots ("Robotrons") have taken control of the world and eradicated most of the human race. The main protagonist is a nameless superhuman attempting to save the last <b>human</b> <b>family.</b>|$|E
5|$|Well, I {{think the}} subject of race has been so {{difficult}} and so polluted by malign ideas that most people have just left it alone, including geneticists. … Most genetic variation is neutral – it doesn't do anything for or against the phenotype, and evolution ignores it – so most previous attempts to look at race have concluded that there's little difference between races. I think this position is the one on which the social scientists are basing their position. … If {{you look at the}} genes that do make a difference, selected genes, which are a tiny handful of the whole, you do find a number of differences, not very many, but a number of interesting differences between races as to which genes have been selected. This, of course, makes a lot of sense, because once the <b>human</b> <b>family</b> dispersed from its homeland in Africa, people faced different environments on each continent, different climates, different evolutionary challenges, and each group adapted to its environment in its own way.|$|E
5|$|The vampires include: the Fool (voiced by Ron Funches), the Empress Eyes (voiced by Rebecca Romijn), the Hierophant (voiced by Paul Williams), the Moon (voiced by Beau Billingslea), and the Vampire King himself (voiced by Billy Brown). The vampires are {{surprised}} {{that they are}} alive again, but quickly disagree {{on what to do}} next and go off on their separate ways. Witnessing this, Jake warns Finn and Marceline. Upon realizing the Vampire King is alive again, Marceline flashes back to her previous battle with him. In order to preserve the vampire race, the Vampire King sacrificed himself to bite Marceline, making her the last vampire. Marceline manages to track down and confront the resurrected Vampire King, killing the Fool and reabsorbing his power of flight. However, before she can battle the still weak Vampire King, he warns her that the Empress is headed for the Ice Kingdom. Fearing {{for the safety of the}} Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny), Marceline gives chase. The Empress arrives at the Ice Kingdom and uses her powers to hypnotize the Ice King, ordering him to bring her the blood of Finn. Marceline attempts to attack the Empress right as the Ice King returns with a captured Finn. Finn escapes, and the Empress orders Ice King to capture them. In an attempt to jog the Ice King's memory, Marceline tells him that she was motivated to start hunting vampires when she killed one trying to attack a <b>human</b> <b>family.</b> However, it's revealed that the Ice King was never hypnotized by the Empress, but merely acting as he always does around women. Marceline then attacks the Empress, but the Empress quickly gains the upper hand until she is paralyzed by a special gun Bubblegum developed. Marceline kills the Empress and reabsorbs her power of invisibility. She then apologizes to her friends for trying to fight the vampires alone and tells them they will hunt the remaining vampires together.|$|E

40|$|Offspring within <b>families,</b> both <b>human</b> and nonhuman, often differ. The obvious {{question}} is: Why? Work on psychological differences on children within <b>human</b> <b>families</b> has {{focused primarily on}} differences in the nonshared environment of contemporary siblings, though the precise location of this nonshared environment is still {{the subject of much}} debate. Here I explore the range of explanations for within-brood diversity from the perspective of nonhuman families, particularly birds that share certain key features with <b>human</b> <b>families.</b> I examine the role of social rank in creating a nonshared environment within the family, and present data from a model system (an altricial bird) to illustrate how different the effective environments experienced by offspring sitting side-by-side in the same confined physical space, tended by the same parents, and experiencing similar ecological variability, can be. These broodmates can effectively live in different worlds. I then briefly explore other sources of diversity among offspring in nonhuman families, including within brood genetic differences and non-genetic maternal (parental) effects that often covary with birth / hatching rank. Given the ubiquity and far-reaching consequences of maternal effects in nonhuman <b>families,</b> and some <b>human</b> data suggestive of similar patterns, it would seem worthwhile to explore the potential role of maternal effects in creating phenotypic diversity in psychological traits among children in <b>human</b> <b>families...</b>|$|R

25|$|Actions and {{emotions}} {{in the current}} lifetime affect future incarnations depending {{on the nature of}} the particular karma. For example, a good and virtuous life indicates a latent desire to experience good and virtuous themes of life. Therefore, such a person attracts karma that ensures that his future births will allow him to experience and manifest his virtues and good feelings unhindered. In this case, he may take birth in heaven or in a prosperous and virtuous <b>human</b> <b>family.</b> On the other hand, a person who has indulged in immoral deeds, or with a cruel disposition, indicates a latent desire to experience cruel themes of life. As a natural consequence, he will attract karma which will ensure that he is reincarnated in hell, or in lower life forms, to enable his soul to experience the cruel themes of life.|$|E

500|$|The game uses a two-{{joystick}} control scheme; {{the left}} joystick controls the on-screen character's movement, while the right controls {{the direction the}} character's weapon fires. Both joysticks allow for an input direction in one of eight ways. Each level, {{referred to as a}} [...] "wave", is a single screen populated with a large number of various enemy robots and obstacles; types include invincible giants to robots that continually manufacture other robots that shoot the protagonist. Coming into contact with an enemy, projectile, or obstacle costs the player one life, but extra lives can be earned at certain point totals. Waves also include <b>human</b> <b>family</b> members who can be rescued to score additional points, but certain robots can either kill them or turn them into enemies. Destroying all vulnerable robots allows the player to progress to the next wave; the cycle continues until all reserve lives are lost.|$|E

500|$|Beginning in 1855, {{the letters}} of the word [...] "Dollars" [...] were enlarged, {{following}} complaints from the public. The same year, coinage began at the San Francisco Mint, where 6,600were struck as opposed to 50,555at Philadelphia. [...] Mintages at Philadelphia declined {{for the remainder of the}} decade, to 7,036by 1860; pieces were also struck at San Francisco in 1856, 1857, and 1860. [...] In 1859, early numismatic writer Montroville W. Dickeson wrote of the three-dollar piece, [...] "it is very unpopular, being frequently mistaken for a quarter eagle, and often counted as a five-dollar piece. [...] It is exceedingly annoying to that portion of the <b>human</b> <b>family</b> whose vision is dependent on artificial aid, and we think its retirement would meet with public approbation." [...] Perhaps a dozen contemporary numismatists collected three-dollar pieces; those who were serious ordered proof coins from the Mint. [...] Coins in this condition became easier to obtain from Philadelphia as officials responded to the rise in interest in coin collecting which followed the introduction of the Flying Eagle cent in 1857.|$|E
500|$|The {{developers}} felt {{a rescue}} theme similar to Defender—one {{of their previous}} games—was needed to complete the game, and added a <b>human</b> <b>family</b> as a method to motivate players to earn a high score. The rescue aspect also created a situation where players had to constantly reevaluate their situation to choose the optimal action: run from enemies, shoot enemies, or rescue humans. Inspired by George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, Jarvis and DeMar worked {{the concept of an}} Orwellian world developed into the plot. The two noticed, however, that 1984 was approaching, but the state of the real world did not match that of the book. They decided to set the game further in the future, the year 2084, to provide a more realistic timeframe for their version of [...] "Big Brother". Jarvis, a science fiction fan, based the Robotrons on the idea that computers would eventually become advanced entities that helped humans in everyday life. He believed the robots would eventually realize that humans are the cause of the world's problems and revolt against them.|$|E
500|$|Fabulous Histories (later {{known as}} The Story of the Robins), Trimmer's most popular work, was first {{published}} in 1786, and remained in print until the beginning of the 20th century. It tells the story of two families, a robin family and a <b>human</b> <b>family,</b> who learn to live together congenially. Most importantly, the human children and the baby robins must learn to adopt virtue and to shun vice. For Trimmer, practising kindness to animals as a child would hopefully lead one to [...] "universal benevolence" [...] as an adult. According to Samuel Pickering, Jr., a scholar of 18th-century children's literature, [...] "in its depiction of 18th-century attitudes toward animals, Mrs. Trimmer’s Fabulous Histories was the most representative children’s book of the period". [...] The text expresses most of the themes that would come to dominate Trimmer's later works, such as her emphasis on retaining social hierarchies; as Tess Cosslett, a scholar of children's literature explains, [...] "the notion of hierarchy that underpins Fabulous Histories is relatively stable and fixed. Parents are above children in terms of authority, and humans above animals, in terms both of dominion and compassion: poor people should be fed before hungry animals… [...] the hierarchical relation of men and women is not so clearly enforced." [...] Moira Ferguson, a scholar of the 18th and 19th centuries, places these themes in a larger historical context, arguing that [...] "the fears of the author and her class about an industrial revolution in ascendance and its repercussions are evident. Hence, [...] text attacks cruelty to birds and animals while affirming British aggression abroad. [...] …The text subtly opts for conservative solutions: maintenance of order and established values, resignation and compliance from the poor at home, expatriation for foreigners who do not assimilate easily." [...] A second overarching theme in the text is rationality; Trimmer expresses the common fear of the power of fiction in her preface, explaining to her childish readers that her fable is not real and that animals cannot really speak. Like many social critics during the 18th century, Trimmer was concerned about fiction's potentially damaging impact on young readers. With the rise of the novel and its concomitant private reading, there was a great fear that young people and especially women would read racy and adventurous stories without the knowledge of their parents and, perhaps even more worrisome, interpret the books as they pleased. Trimmer therefore always referred to her text as Fabulous Histories and never as The Story of the Robins in order to emphasize its reality; moreover, she did not allow the book to be illustrated within her lifetime—pictures of talking birds would only have reinforced the paradox of the book (it was fiction parading as a history). Yarde has also speculated that most of the characters in the text are drawn from Trimmer's own acquaintances and family.|$|E

2500|$|A less open {{opposition}} to the doctrine may {{have been carried out}} by Mormon editors Samuel W. Richards and Franklin D.
