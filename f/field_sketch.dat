Like nearly all of Bauer's field drawings of Proteaceae, the original <b>field</b> <b>sketch</b> of B.coccinea was destroyed in a Hofburg fire in 1945. However a watercolour painting by Bauer, based on his field sketches, still survives at the Natural History Museum in London, and a hand-coloured copper engraving from that painting was published as Plate 3 of Bauer's 1813 Illustrationes Florae Novae Hollandiae. German botanist Adalbert Schnizlein described B.purpurea in 1843, now regarded as a synonym of B.coccinea. Common names include scarlet banksia, waratah banksia and Albany banksia.|$|E
5|$|Specimens of B.ilicifolia {{were first}} {{collected}} by Scottish surgeon Archibald Menzies during {{the visit of}} the Vancouver Expedition to King George Sound in September and October 1791, but this collection {{did not result in}} the description of the species.

Like nearly all of Bauer's field drawings of Proteaceae, the original <b>field</b> <b>sketch</b> of B.ilicifolia was destroyed in a Hofburg fire in 1945.

25|$|A rare {{painting}} of his, , showing British surveyor John Henry Lefroy, {{which had been}} in possession of the Lefroy family in England, garnered a record price at an auction at Sotheby's in Toronto on February 25, 2002, when Canadian billionaire Kenneth Thomson won the bid at C$5,062,500 including the buyer's premium (US$3,172,567.50 at the time). Thomson subsequently donated the painting {{as part of his}} Thomson Collection to the Art Gallery of Ontario. The Glenbow Museum in Calgary has a copy of this painting that is thought to have been done by Kane's wife Harriet Clench. Another auction at Sotheby's on November 22, 2004, for Kane's oil painting Encampment, Winnipeg River (after the <b>field</b> <b>sketch</b> shown above) failed when bidding stopped at C$1.7 million, less than the expected sale price of C$2–2.5 million.|$|E

Between 1941-1952, no awards were made. Thereafter, the Corps of Guides was awarded for surveying and <b>field</b> <b>sketching.</b>|$|R
25|$|On both trips Kane sketched {{and painted}} Aboriginal peoples and {{documented}} their lives. Upon {{his return to}} Toronto, he produced {{more than one hundred}} oil paintings from these sketches. Kane's work, particularly his <b>field</b> <b>sketches,</b> are still a valuable resource for ethnologists. The oil paintings he completed in his studio are considered a part of the Canadian heritage, although he often embellished them considerably, departing from the accuracy of his <b>field</b> <b>sketches</b> in favour of more dramatic scenes.|$|R
50|$|The Panoramic View of King George's Sound {{originated}} with sketches made by Dale {{from the summit}} of Mount Clarence.

500|$|The next {{collection}} {{was made in}} December 1801, when King George Sound was visited by HMS Investigator {{under the command of}} Matthew Flinders. On board were botanist Robert Brown, botanical artist Ferdinand Bauer, and gardener Peter Good. All three men gathered material for Brown's specimen collection, including specimens of B.sessilis, although neither Brown's nor Good's diary can be used to assign a precise location or date for their discovery of the species. Good also made a separate seed collection, which included B.sessilis, and the species was drawn by Bauer. Like nearly all of his field drawings of Proteaceae, Bauer's original <b>field</b> <b>sketch</b> of B.sessilis was destroyed in a Hofburg fire in 1945.

2500|$|Kane's fame {{rests in}} his depictions of Native American life. His <b>field</b> <b>sketches</b> {{were done in}} pencil, watercolour, or oil on paper. He also brought back from his trips a {{collection}} of various artefacts such as masks, pipe stems, and other handicrafts. [...] Together, these {{formed the basis for}} his later studio work. He drew on this pool of impressions for his large oil canvases, in which he typically combined or reinterpreted them to create new compositions. The <b>field</b> <b>sketches</b> are a valuable resource for ethnologists, but the oil paintings, while still truthful in the individual details of Native American lifestyle, are often unfaithful to geographic, historic, or ethnographic settings in their overall compositions.|$|R
25|$|Bierstadt {{returned}} to his studio in New York and, in 1866, completed his oil painting, one of many inspired by <b>field</b> <b>sketches</b> made during that trip. He named the painting after his mistress, Rosalie Osborne, whom he had married on November 21, 1866.|$|R
500|$|The next known {{collection}} was in December 1801, during {{the visit of}} HMS Investigator to King George Sound. Little is known of the circumstances of this collection, other than what is written on the specimen label: [...] "King Georges Sound Decr 1801". The specimen is credited to Robert Brown, but gardener Peter Good and the botanical artist Ferdinand Bauer also contributed to Brown's specimen collection, often without attribution. A more precise date and location cannot be given, as neither Brown nor Good mentions the collection in his diary. Bauer did not publish an illustration of the species and his original <b>field</b> <b>sketches</b> are lost, but William Westall appears to have incorporated it into two of his <b>field</b> <b>sketches,</b> and certainly included it in the foreground {{of one of the}} oil paintings that he later worked up for the Admiralty.|$|R

50|$|Williams was {{a master}} of the art of <b>field</b> <b>sketching,</b> {{formerly}} practiced by many naturalists.

40|$|Longitudinal and radial {{stresses}} in a M. V. and H. V. cables through terminals are computed using Schwarz Christoffel transformation for <b>field</b> <b>sketching.</b> The terminals {{and associated}} cable are rated at 11 KV, 33 KV and 132 KV a. c insulated by cross–linked polyethylene (XLPE). The electrical <b>field</b> <b>sketching</b> at the cable terminations {{is carried out}} theoretically {{and the results are}} confirmed by experiments. It seems that the maximum stresses occurs in the cable insulation and the maximum longitudinal stresses along the screened outer surface of the cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) insulation occurs between the cable and the termination center. The results show that the maximum longitudinal stress is many times the oncorrespding maximum radial values.

Pre-markers are used to draw a <b>field</b> <b>sketch</b> in advance to avoid faulty marking. Road marking removers are used to remove old or incorrect markings.
