50|$|The {{article on}} {{universal}} <b>enveloping</b> algebras describes the canonical construction of <b>enveloping</b> algebras, {{as well as}} the PBW-type theorems for them. For Lie algebras, such <b>enveloping</b> algebras have a universal property, which does not hold, in general, for non-associative algebras. The best-known example is, perhaps the Albert algebra, an exceptional Jordan algebra that is not <b>enveloped</b> by the canonical construction of the <b>enveloping</b> algebra for Jordan algebras.|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{universal}} <b>enveloping</b> algebras of the one-parameter family of solvable 5 -dimensional non-Lie Malcev algebras. We explicitly determine the universal nonassociative <b>enveloping</b> algebras (in {{the sense of}} Perez-Izquierdo and Shestakov) and the centers of the universal <b>enveloping</b> algebras. We also determine the universal alternative <b>enveloping</b> algebras. Comment: 18 page...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} the quasi-Poisson <b>enveloping</b> algebra and Poisson <b>enveloping</b> algebra for a non-commutative Poisson algebra. We prove {{that for a}} non-commutative Poisson algebra, the category of quasi-Poisson modules {{is equivalent to the}} category of left modules over its quasi-Poisson <b>enveloping</b> algebra, and the category of Poisson modules is equivalent to the category of left modules over its Poisson <b>enveloping</b> algebra.

5|$|With Taejon captured, North Korean forces {{began the}} effort of {{surrounding}} the Pusan Perimeter from all sides {{in an attempt to}} <b>envelop</b> it. The North Korean 4th Infantry Division and the North Korean 6th Infantry Division advanced south in a wide maneuver. The two divisions were coordinating to <b>envelop</b> the UN's left flank and were extremely spread out. They advanced on UN positions pushing back US and South Korean forces repeatedly. Forces of the 3rd Battalion, 29th Infantry Regiment, newly arrived in the country, were wiped out at Hadong in a coordinated ambush by North Korean forces on July 27, leaving open a pass to the Pusan area. Soon after, Chinju to the west was taken, pushing back the 19th Infantry Regiment and leaving routes to the Pusan open for North Korean forces.|$|E
5|$|American {{planners}} {{believed that}} the Hadong area was under attack from elements of the North Korean 4th Infantry Division, having just received replacements following its victory at Taejon. However, the soldiers in the area were actually from the North Korean 6th Infantry Division {{under the command of}} General Pang Ho San. The two divisions were coordinating to <b>envelop</b> the UN's left flank and were extremely spread out. Therefore, only groups of a few hundred were advancing through the region, some with small numbers of tanks.|$|E
5|$|As the Sun expands, it will {{swallow the}} planets Mercury and Venus. Earth's fate is less clear; {{although}} the Sun will <b>envelop</b> Earth's current orbit, the star's loss of mass (and thus weaker gravity) {{will cause the}} planets' orbits to move farther out. If it were only for this, Venus and Earth would probably escape incineration, but a 2008 study suggests that Earth will likely be swallowed up {{as a result of}} tidal interactions with the Sun's weakly bound outer envelope.|$|E

40|$|We {{continue}} our {{investigation of the}} general notion of universal <b>enveloping</b> algebra introduced in [A. Ardizzoni, "A Milnor-Moore Type Theorem for Primitively Generated Braided Bialgebras", J. Algebra 327 (2011), no. 1, 337 [...] 365]. Namely we study when such an algebra is of PBW type, meaning that a suitable PBW type theorem holds. We discuss the problem of finding a basis for a universal <b>enveloping</b> algebra of PBW type: As an application we recover the PBW basis both of an ordinary universal <b>enveloping</b> algebra and of a restricted <b>enveloping</b> algebra. We prove that a universal <b>enveloping</b> algebra is of PBW type {{if and only if}} it is cosymmetric. We characterize braided bialgebra liftings of Nichols algebras as universal <b>enveloping</b> algebras of PBW type...|$|R
5|$|The {{plan to take}} Bapaume {{involved}} the 1st Infantry Brigade, positioned at Grévillers, moving {{to the south of}} Bapaume with the 63rd Division moving forward to protect the right flank of the New Zealanders. Meanwhile, the 2nd Infantry Brigade would move {{to the north of the}} town. Its left flank would be protected by the 37th Division. Their aim was to <b>envelop</b> Bapaume and force the Germans to abandon the town and thus avoid costly street to street fighting.|$|E
5|$|When {{faced with}} opponents who used {{unfamiliar}} fighting techniques, {{such as in}} Central Asia and India, Alexander adapted his forces to his opponents' style. Thus, in Bactria and Sogdiana, Alexander successfully used his javelin throwers and archers to prevent outflanking movements, while massing his cavalry at the center. In India, confronted by Porus' elephant corps, the Macedonians opened their ranks to <b>envelop</b> the elephants and used their sarissas to strike upwards and dislodge the elephants' handlers.|$|E

The 4th and 6th North Korean Infantry Divisions advanced south in a wide flanking maneuver. The two divisions attempted to penetrate the UN's left flank, but became highly dispersed in the process. They advanced on UN positions with armor and superior numbers, repeatedly pushing back US and South Korean forces.|$|E

5000|$|CNPV is an <b>enveloped</b> virus. [...] They can be <b>enveloped</b> by double (external <b>enveloped</b> virion- EEV) {{or single}} (intracellular mature virion - IMV) {{membranes}}. These membranes are acquired from the host cell's endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or cell membrane. CNPV and other poxviruses are characterised by having exceptionally large physical dimensions, approximately 330 nm×280 nm×200 nm.|$|R
5|$|Envelope: Some {{species of}} virus <b>envelop</b> {{themselves}} in a modified form {{of one of the}} cell membranes, either the outer membrane surrounding an infected host cell or internal membranes such as nuclear membrane or endoplasmic reticulum, thus gaining an outer lipid bilayer known as a viral envelope. This membrane is studded with proteins coded for by the viral genome and host genome; the lipid membrane itself and any carbohydrates present originate entirely from the host. The influenza virus and HIV use this strategy. Most enveloped viruses are dependent on the envelope for their infectivity.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur's {{decision}} to move swiftly against Finschhafen, coupled with Blamey's to <b>envelop</b> the Japanese defences by landing at Scarlet Beach, and Yamada's to avoid a decisive engagement that might result {{in the loss of}} all or part of his force, gave Windeyer the time and space he needed to take Finschhafen. Blamey's objective was therefore in Allied hands; but it was of limited use without Sattelberg. The Allied intelligence failure and subsequent dithering meant that the Japanese reinforced their position faster, and thus were able to seize the initiative.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon's plan envisaged {{that the}} Allies would throw many troops to <b>envelop</b> his right flank {{in order to}} cut the French {{communication}} line from Vienna. As a result, the Allies' centre and left flank would be exposed and become vulnerable. To encourage them to do so, Napoleon abandoned the strategic position on the Pratzen Heights, faking the weakness of his forces and his own caution. Meanwhile, Napoleon's main force was to be concealed in a dead ground opposite the Heights. According to the plan, the French troops would attack and recapture the Pratzen Heights, then from the Heights they would launch a decisive assault {{to the center of}} the Allied army, cripple them, and encircle them from the rear.|$|E

In particular, the universal <b>enveloping</b> algebra is always infinite dimensional.|$|R
40|$|Lie antialgebras is a {{class of}} supercommutative algebras {{recently}} appeared in symplectic geometry. We define the notion of <b>enveloping</b> algebra of a Lie antialgebra and study its properties.

50|$|In {{mathematical}} representation theory, a Harish-Chandra homomorphism is a homomorphism from a subalgebra of {{the universal}} <b>enveloping</b> algebra of a semisimple Lie algebra to the universal <b>enveloping</b> algebra of a subalgebra.

5|$|North Korean {{planners}} {{intended for}} three divisions to attack Taejon from three directions, supported by tanks. The North Korean 3rd Division {{was ordered to}} attack from the north, against the flank. The North Korean 4th Division would attack across the Kum River from the east and south, in order to <b>envelop</b> Taejon and the US 24th Infantry Division with it. Eventually they would also be supported by elements of the North Korean 105th Armored Division. Although the North Korean 2nd Infantry Division was ordered to attack from Chongju against the American right flank, it was slow to move and arrived too late {{to participate in the}} battle.|$|E
5|$|Reviewing the {{situation}} {{at the end of}} the day, Edson, along with Colonel Gerald Thomas and Lieutenant Colonel Merrill Twining from Vandegrift's staff, decided to try to encircle the Japanese defenders around Point Cruz. They ordered 1/5 and 3/5 to continue to press the Japanese along the coast the next day while 2/5 wheeled north to <b>envelop</b> their adversaries west and south of Point Cruz. Tamura's battalion had taken heavy losses in the day's fighting, with Tamura's 7th and 5th Companies being left with only 10 and 15 uninjured soldiers respectively.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{started the}} withdrawal, while the {{motorized}} Allied forces broke {{out from their}} bridgeheads and pursued the German units from behind. The rapid Allied advance posed a major threat for the Germans, who could not retreat fast enough. The Germans tried to establish a defense line at the Rhône to shield the withdrawal of several valuable units there. The US 45th and 3rd Divisions were pressing to the north-west with uncontested speed, undermining Wiese's plan for a new defense line. Barjols and Brignoles were taken by the two American divisions on 19August, which also were about to <b>envelop</b> Toulon as well as Marseille from the north, cutting off the German units there.|$|E
40|$|During the {{replication}} cycle of vaccinia virus, four {{different forms of}} viral particles are produced. The two extracellular <b>enveloped</b> forms, cell-associated <b>enveloped</b> virus and extracellular <b>enveloped</b> virus, are responsible for cell-to-cell transmission and long-range spread of infection both in vivo and in vitro. Despite the biological importance of the <b>enveloped</b> forms, the mechanism of envelopment and the components involved in this process have been analysed only recently. Therefore the individual steps and the rate-limiting factors of the envelopment process are still unknown. The protein p 37 K, an unglycosylated but acylated envelope protein of molecular mass 37 kDa, {{has been shown to}} be essential for envelopment. However, this study shows that over-expression of p 37 K by vaccinia virus recombinants reduces rather than increases the yield of infectious <b>enveloped</b> virus which is mainly due to the <b>enveloped</b> virions exhibiting a strongly diminished specific infectivity...|$|R

40|$|The {{notion of}} a non-associative {{universal}} <b>enveloping</b> algebra for a Lie triple system arises when Lie triple systems are considered as Bol algebras (more generally, Sabinin algebras). In this paper a new construction for these universal <b>enveloping</b> algebras is given, and their properties are studied. It is shown that universal <b>enveloping</b> algebras of Lie triple systems have surprisingly few ideals. It is conjectured, and the conjecture is verified on several examples, that the only proper ideal of the universal <b>enveloping</b> algebra of a simple Lie triple system is the augmentation ideal.

5|$|At 07:00 on {{the morning}} of 25 November, the Portuguese {{garrison}} at Ngomano received word from a British intelligence officer that an attack was about to commence. Nevertheless, when the attack came they were unprepared. In order to distract Pinto and his men, the Germans shelled the camp from across the river with high explosive rounds. While the artillery attacked the camp, the Germans moved their forces upstream and crossed the Rovuma safely out sight of Pinto and his men. The Portuguese did not resist von Lettow-Vorbeck's forces when they crossed the river and remained encamped at Ngomano. The Germans were easily able to flank the Portuguese positions and completely <b>envelop</b> them with six companies of German infantry attacking the camp from the south, south-east and west.|$|E
5|$|By late on May 29, a weak trough {{over the}} Yucatán Peninsula {{produced}} {{a small area}} of convection over the Yucatán Channel. Convection increased {{in association with the}} trough, and the next day a broad <b>envelop</b> of cyclonic turning developed within the system. By May 30, the moisture from the trough extended from Nicaragua through the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, with the greatest area of convection near Cuba. A westward moving tropical wave spawned a broad area of low pressure on May 30, and by May 31 a circulation developed within the system to the southeast of Cozumel, Mexico. The low moved north-northeastward, and gradually became better organized despite high amounts of vertical wind shear. The deep convection became more concentrated near the center, and it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression at 1200UTC on June 1 just to the northwest of the western tip of Cuba. Operationally, it was not classified until eleven hours later.|$|E
