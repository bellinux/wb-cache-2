40|$|Calculation of Box Compression Resistance (BCR) is a {{challenging}} task {{and here the}} possibility of an engineering approach is considered. The strive has been towards obtaining a simple and general predictive tool with as few parameters as possible and still obtaining an accurate estimate of the BCR. The model proposed is based on the concept of dividing the package into panels and corner panels. With these remarkably few structural elements it is possible to obtain simple explicit formulas where the only material parameters are given by standard tests in terms of short span compression test and bending resistance. The BCR for different packages is then obtained by a simply summation of the load from the panels and corner panels.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the factors that measure the {{performance}} of boards of directors (‘the board’) of NHS foundation trusts and the association between board and organisational performance. The study investigated six <b>dimensions</b> of effective <b>board</b> performance- contextual, educational, interpersonal, analytical, political and strategic- as suggested by Chait, Holland and Taylor (1993) from their extensive research involving nonprofit boards, including hospital boards, in the USA. A total of 79 board members (42 executive and 37 non-executive directors) representing 21 foundation trusts (organisational response rate 33. 9 %) responded to a Board Self-Assessment Questionnaire (BSAQ) incorporating the six <b>dimensions</b> of <b>board</b> performance. Factor analysis showed that the six dimensions were similar for NHS foundation trusts as for nonprofit boards in the USA and, further, that the dimensions can be consolidated into a higher level construct of board performance.

40|$|Governance theory {{predicts that}} board composition, board size, diversity, and CEO duality {{will have a}} direct effect on {{organizational}} effectiveness. Nevertheless, previous empirical research has found equivocal results when testing these relationships. In addition, governance theorists have suggested that board process is an important determinant of organizational effectiveness, but rarely have process data been examined in the empirical research on boards of directors. Board decision making process has not been developed adequately nor tested, so that {{little is known about}} the specific <b>dimensions</b> of <b>board</b> decision making process and its affect on performance. This study develops a model of board influence on organizational effectiveness which details two types of intervening variables: activity and the exchange context. The primary activity of the board is strategic decision making and evaluation. The exchange context is developed by integrating a review of the decision making and groups literatures. The exchange context is comprised of interaction, information sharing, discussion style, and participation. A test of the model demonstrated direct positive relationships between the exchange context and organizational effectiveness. In addition, some tests demonstrated that the exchange context moderated the relationship between board input variables and organizational effectiveness. Thus, in addition to developing <b>dimensions</b> of <b>board</b> decision making process, the empirical results in this project provide some explanation for previous equivocal results in testing the relationships between board input variables and organizational effectiveness. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to explain the}} impact of board structure on company performance. This involves establishing the dimensionality of <b>board</b> structure. Two <b>dimensions</b> are found: <b>board</b> independence and network connections. The effect of each <b>dimension</b> of <b>board</b> structure on performance is then investigated. The examination begins with two competing theories: agency and stewardship. Using the agency theory model, it is hypothesised that an independent board will control self-interested behaviour and put incentive alignment mechanisms in place and that these actions will strengthen firm performance. In opposition to agency theory, stewardship}p theory holds that managerial control of the firm empowers and motivates managers to maximise company profits. Therefore, managerial control of the board leads to high company performance. There is a third theoretical framework dominant ln governance research, resource dependence, which is also examined. This theory focuses on the board's role in co-opting external resources for the organization. It is also tested using data on network connections and firm performance. The study uses a sample of 145 publicly listed Australian companies. Data from archival sources was collected for the period 1992 - 1994. The impact of board structure is assessed using a lagged design with performance being measured subsequent to structure. Confidence {{in the direction of}} causality from structure to performance is established with controls for prior performance. Industry, size, risk and leverage are also controlled The main results of the regression analyses suggest that board independence has a negative effect on shareholder wealth and sales growth. Network connections have no effect. These results challenge agency and resource dependence theory and support the newer perspective, stewardship theory. Boards characterised by managerial control are found to have positive effects on shareholder wealth and sales growth. However, in treating the two <b>dimensions</b> of <b>board</b> independence and network connections separately, a new pattern appears. Board independence is moderated by network connections. The effect of board independence is contingent on high connections...|$|R

Our results challenge the commonly accepted view of independent directors as safeguards of shareholder value, uncovering the relevance of non-independent outsiders for pay moderation and incentives...|$|R
