The Illegitimate births in 1846-1850 {{numbered}} 2.2 per 1000, in 1896- 1900 they numbered 1.2 per 1000. So {{that if it were}} not for this fall in illegitimate births the period 1896-1900 would show a positive rise in the effective rate of increase of [...] .8 per thousand. The eminent persons therefore who ascribe our <b>falling</b> <b>birth-rate</b> to irreligion and so forth, either speak without knowledge or with some sort of knowledge beyond my ken. England is, as a matter of fact, becoming not only more hygienic and rational, but more moral and more temperate. The highly moral, healthy, prolific, pious England of the past is just another poetical delusion of the healthy savage type.] ...|$|E

As the proofs of these pages pass through my hands comes the news of Mr. Lloyd George's settlement of the dispute between railway directors and employés by the establishment of a method of compulsory arbitration. Then, again, the movement for public sanitation and hygiene spreads and broadens, and the natural alarm of even the most conservative at the <b>falling</b> <b>birth-rate</b> and the stationary infantile death-rate is evidently ripening for an advance towards public control and care even in the relation of child to parent, the most intimate of all personal affairs.|$|E

60|$|The effectual modifying {{force at}} {{work is not}} the strangeness nor the temperamental {{maladjustment}} of the new elements of population, but the conscious realisation of the inadequacy of the tradition {{on the part of}} the more intelligent sections of the American population. That blind national conceit that would hear no criticism and admit no deficiency has disappeared. In the last decade such a change has come over the American mind as sometimes comes over a vigorous and wilful child. Suddenly it seems to have grown up, to have begun to weigh its powers and consider its possible deficiencies. There was a time when American confidence and self-satisfaction seemed impregnable; at the slightest qualm of doubt America took to violent rhetoric as a drunkard resorts to drink. Now the indictment I have drawn up harshly, bluntly and unflatteringly in Sec. 4 would receive the endorsement of American after American. The <b>falling</b> <b>birth-rate</b> of all the best elements in the State, the cankering effect of political corruption, the crumbling of independence and equality before the progressive aggregation of wealth--he has to face them, he cannot deny them. There has arisen a new literature, the literature of national self-examination, that seems destined to modify the American tradition profoundly. To me it seems to involve the hope and possibility of a conscious collective organisation of social life.|$|E

60|$|I suppose if {{one fact}} has been {{hammered}} into {{us in the}} past two decades more than any other it is this: that the supply of children is falling off in the modern State; that births, and particularly good-quality births, are not abundant enough; that the birth-rate, and particularly the good-class <b>birth-rate,</b> <b>falls</b> steadily below the needs of our future.|$|R
40|$|Europe {{has faced}} {{for several decades}} and is still facing an ageing process of its population. Within it, Romania, a country, striving to {{successfully}} integrate into the European Union, is also experiencing the same process. The ageing process of the Romanian population started {{at the beginning of}} the 20 th century and evolved progressively, ever since, with significant visible rates in the rural areas. Romania’s population age structure, {{at the beginning of the}} Third Millennium, was, according to international experts, not significantly aged compared to populations of the economically advanced countries of Europe. Due to <b>falling</b> <b>birth-rates</b> and the labor emigration rush, the ageing process of the Romanian population has become increasingly serious, argued by a rate of 19. 4 % over 60 -year-old population, of which 24. 5 % (2008) belongs to the rural area. The main responsible reason for this demographic and social situation is the replacement of the traditional reproduction pattern, mainly characterized by high birth and death rates, with a modern one, characterized by very low rates of the same kind. Low values in natality were, on one hand, the result of a steady regression of fertility, and on the other of, a drop in general mortality, hence the lengthening of the average life-span. To be able to cope with a relatively new phenomenon such as ageing of population, Romania needs to seriously consider adequate measures and steps towards achieving balance. Visionary strategy and plans require, well-grounded medium-and-long-term development programmes especially for the Romanian rural area...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} realisation that advanced economies are suffering from {{a new wave of}} rural depopulation as a consequence of a ‘perfect storm’ of rural outmigration and <b>falling</b> <b>birth-rates.</b> The issue of managed decline (i. e. rural demolition) has actively been proposed as the only inevitable solution to this issue of rural decline, but experience shows {{is that it is not}} a solution to the question of where and how to live for the populations that inhabit these condemned places. In this paper we are concerned with whether expressions of rural populations can contest policy-makers’ visions for these shrinking rural regions and address the central policy pessimism. In particular, we are concerned with attempts by residents themselves in these rural areas to address the issue of loss of vital services through their own interventions. In this paper, we focus on the process of “social entrepreneurship” as a means by which local communities can attempt to address the vicious circle of rural depopulation. We focus on the issue how can we characterise rural social entrepreneurs’ different kinds of motivations as a starting point to develop policy approaches that seek to support rural communities. Drawing on a case study of the Twente region, we identify nine motivation narratives expressed by social entrepreneurs. These are primarily concerned with doing useful and rewarding things, and only secondarily with embodying various kinds of entrepreneurial identity. We conclude with a typology of rural social entrepreneur motivations and its potential applications in improving rural development policy...|$|R

40|$|From {{the latter}} part of the nineteenth century until the 1950 ' the western world, {{including}} Australia, was preoccupied with the size, composition and health of each nation's population. The common problems were a <b>falling</b> <b>birth-rate</b> and an alarmingly high infant mortality rate. In underpopulated Australia there was an additional perceived threat: of being overrun, in the language of the time, by the prolific breeding Asians nearby. From the 1890 ' to the 1930 ' this population ideology gave rise to the growth of 'experts' in various fields of public health who sought to exercise a rational control over all aspects of family life, and women's lives in particular. The construction of modern Australian femininity was directly influenced by population ideology and its campaigns: for public health, infant welfare, social purity, [1] education, child welfare and protective labour laws. The focus of population ideology was the family. The focus of reform, and central to the family, 'was woman, defined as the ideal mother' or 'the good mother'. At its height, during the 1920 ' and 1930 ', population ideology became part of commonsense, part of everyday know [2]. This paper focuses on what occurred in the area of infant welfare and education for motherhood in Victoria and is based on the role played by Tweddle Hospital, (situated on the corner of Gordon St and Barkly St in Footscray), in promulgating the ideal of the 'good mother'. ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{reasons for}} the <b>fall</b> in the <b>birth-rate</b> are obvious enough. It is a {{necessary}} consequence of the individualistic competition of modern life. People talk of modern women [...] "shirking" [...] motherhood, {{but it would be}} a silly sort of universe in which a large proportion of women had any natural and instinctive desire to shirk motherhood, and, I believe, a huge proportion of modern women are as passionately predisposed towards motherhood as ever women were. But modern conditions conspire to put a heavy handicap upon parentage and an enormous premium upon the partial or complete evasion of offspring, and that is where the clue to the trouble lies. Our social arrangements discourage parentage very heavily, and the rational thing for a statesman to do in the matter is not to grow eloquent, but to do intelligent things to minimise that discouragement.|$|R

Suffice it, that now all the tendency is back towards restraints upon increase, to an increasing celibacy, to a <b>fall</b> in the <b>birth-rate</b> and in the average size of families, to--to a release of women from an entire devotion to a numerous offspring, and so at last to the supersession of those little family units that for four centuries have made up the substance of social life and determined nearly all our moral and sentimental attitudes. The autonomy of the family is being steadily destroyed, and it is being replaced by the autonomy of the individual in relation to some syndicated economic effort." ...|$|R
60|$|The vast {{bulk of the}} {{population}} of the United States has, in fact, only got there from Europe in the course of the last hundred years, and mainly since the accession of Queen Victoria to the throne of Great Britain. That is the first fact that the student of the American social future must realise. Only an extremely small proportion of its blood goes back now to those who fought for freedom in the days of George Washington. The American community is not an expanded colonial society that has become autonomous. It is a great and deepening pool of population accumulating upon the area these predecessors freed, and since fed copiously by affluents from every European community. Fresh ingredients are still being added in enormous quantity, in quantity so great as to materially change the racial quality in a score of years. It is particularly noteworthy that each accession of new blood seems to sterilise its predecessors. Had there been no immigration at all into the United States, but had the rate of increase that prevailed in 1810-20 prevailed to 1900, {{the population}}, which would then have been a purely native American one, would have amounted to a hundred million--that is to say, to approximately nine million in excess of the present total population. The new waves are for a time amazingly fecund, and then comes a rapid <b>fall</b> in the <b>birth-rate.</b> The proportion of colonial and early republican blood in the population is, therefore, probably far smaller even than the figures I have quoted would suggest.|$|R
60|$|But this {{tradition}} {{has failed to}} produce the beginnings or promise of any new phase of civilised organisation, the growths have remained largely invertebrate and chaotic, and, concurrently with its gift of splendid and monstrous growth, it has also developed portentous political and economic evils. No doubt the increment of human energy has been considerable, {{but it has been}} much less than appears at first sight. Much of the human energy that America has displayed in the last century is not a development of new energy but a diversion. It has been accompanied by a <b>fall</b> in the <b>birth-rate</b> that even the immigration torrent has not altogether replaced. Its insistence on the individual, its disregard of the collective organisation, its treatment of women and children as each man's private concern, has had its natural outcome. Men's imaginations have been turned entirely upon individual and immediate successes and upon concrete triumphs; they have had no regard or only an ineffectual sentimental regard for the race. Every man was looking after himself, {{and there was no one}} to look after the future. Had the promise of 1815 been fulfilled, there would now be in the United States of America one hundred million descendants of the homogeneous and free-spirited native population of that time. There is not, as a matter of fact, more than thirty-five million. There is probably, as I have pointed out, much less. Against the assets of cities, railways, mines and industrial wealth won, the American tradition has to set the price of five-and-seventy million native citizens who have never found time to get born, and whose place is now more or less filled by alien substitutes. Biologically speaking, this is not a triumph for the American tradition. It is, however, very clearly an outcome of the intense individualism of that tradition. Under the sway of that it has burnt its future in the furnace to keep up steam.|$|R
6000|$|A {{portion of}} infant and child {{mortality}} represents {{no doubt the}} lingering and wasteful removal from this world of beings with inherent defects, beings who, for the most part, ought never to have been born, and need not have been born under conditions of greater foresight. These, however, are the merest small fraction of our infant mortality. It leaves untouched {{the fact that a}} vast multitude of children of untainted blood and good mental and moral possibilities, as many, perhaps, as 100 in each 1,000 born, die yearly through insufficient food, insufficient good air, and insufficient attention. The plain and simple truth is that they are born needlessly. There are still too many births for our civilisation to look after, we are still unfit to be trusted with a rising birth-rate. [Footnote: It is a digression from the argument of this Paper, but I would like to point out here a very popular misconception about the birth-rate which needs exposure. It is known that the <b>birth-rate</b> is <b>falling</b> in all European countries--a fall which has a very direct relation to a rise in the mean standard of comfort and the average age at marriage--and alarmists foretell a time when nations will be extinguished through this decline. They ascribe it to a certain decay in religious faith, to the advance of science and scepticism, and so forth; it is a part, they say, of a general demoralization. The thing is a popular cant and quite unsupported by facts. The decline in the birth-rate is--so far as England and Wales goes--partly a real decline due to a decline in gross immorality, partly to a real decline due to the later age at which women marry, and partly a statistical decline due to an increased proportion of people too old or too young for child-bearing. Wherever the infant mortality is falling there is an apparent misleading <b>fall</b> in the <b>birth-rate</b> due to the [...] "loading" [...] of the population with children. Here are the sort of figures that are generally given. They are the figures for England and Wales for two typical periods.|$|R
40|$|The Parsis of India are a {{very small}} but {{important}} ethnic group, traditionally living in Gujarat but in modern times mainly located in Bombay, where, under the British Raj, they established themselves as leading merchants, politicians and professional people with an influence far exceeding their numerical strength. Since Indian Independence in 1947, that influence has declined as has the total size of the Parsi community in India. Many {{members of the community}} have dispersed overseas and during the last twenty years, New Zealand has emerged as a growing destination of choice. Many reasons have been put forward both by academia and by members of the Parsi community itself for the steeply declining numbers ranging from religious and ethnic exclusivity to loss of fecundity and consequential <b>fall</b> in the <b>birth-rate</b> to below the sustainability level. In my initial research for this thesis, I became aware that one reason for the decline, which did not feature in academic discourses but which seemed to be important, was the significance of Parsi culture, in particular the traditional emphasis on individual achievement, at the expense of communal cohesion. In seeking to corroborate my hypothesis, along with whether or not the current drive to migrate from India to countries such as New Zealand is having a positive or negative influence on the long-term chances for Parsi survival, I have carried out in-depth interviews with a cross-section of Parsis now resident in New Zealand. The outcomes of these interviews, together with a careful study of Parsi history and an analysis of their very distinctive culture, form the basis for my study. These outcomes and analyses have created an overall picture, which has confirmed my belief that the most important contributing factor to demographic decline amongst the Indian Parsi community has been their traditional drive towards individual material success. They have also shown that individual choice has been the principle post-Independence migratory driving force. There are more negative than positive elements associated with this migratory drive with the future of both Parsi identity and Zoroastrianism under serious threat through increasing dispersal and religious, ethnic and cultural dilution. This deteriorating situation is further exacerbated by internal strife fuelled by passionate ethno-religious debate over the best way forward...|$|R

By such expedients we may hope to see, first, a certain <b>fall</b> in the <b>birth-rate,</b> a <b>fall</b> chiefly in the birth-rate of improvident, vicious, and feeble types, a continuation, in fact, of that fall that is already so conspicuous in illegitimate births in Great Britain; secondly, a certain, almost certainly more considerable fall in the death-rate of infants and young children, and that fall in the infantile death-rate will serve to indicate, thirdly, a fall no statistics will fully demonstrate in what I may call the partial death-rate, the dwarfing and limiting of that innumerable host of children who do, in an underfed, meagre sort of a way, survive. This raising of the standard of homes will do a work that will not end with the children; the death-line will sag downward for all the first twenty or thirty years of life.

I wish I could get together all these people who are so scornful of materialistic things, out of the excessively comfortable houses they inhabit, and I wish I could concentrate them in a good typical East London slum--five or six together in each room, one lodging with another, and I wish I could leave them there to demonstrate the superiority of high ideals to purely material considerations for the rest of their earthly career while we others went on with our sordid work unencumbered by their ideality.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The <b>birth-rate</b> <b>falls</b> and {{mortality}} declines owing to improving social-economic conditions in all advanced countries. More {{and more people}} live longer and the old age is becoming corporate phenomenon. Health state of seniors gets worse with an elongating age. Specific geriatric syndromes influence {{the quality of their}} lives, immobilization syndrom lays them up and it adverts them to a help of others. In my bachelor work I have aimed mainly at older immobile patients who are hospitalized in hospitels in post-care wards and I also aimed at immobile seniors who live in rest homes. Activation of immobile clients is very important, it could partly compensate the missing family life, its cares and joys {{and at the same time}} any maningful activity provides person with a life purpose, feeling of own importance. It is ideal to reveal needs and desires of immobile clients and also to offer them relative activities and accomplish them effectively. Big part of this duty falls on own patients family. The family cannot always fulfill their task either because family cannot take care or in a worse case the family do not want to. This work in a theoretic part consits of chapters connected to given problems, it means definition of notions immobility and immobilization syndrom, examples of different forms of activation, relation and connections between health and a quality of patients life. In a research part I have dealt with an influence of activation on a patient from a nurses` point of view, I have also dealt with possibilities of accomplishing activating methods in different medical facilities and nurses` competence and their ralation to an activation. The aim of my research is to find out whether a suitable activation influences a dependence of an immobile patient on his surroundings and whether it shows it on a quality of patients life from a nurses` point of view. Second aim of my work was to compare and activation of immobile patients among different medical facilities. I have chosen a post-care wards and a rest home for comparing activation. The first hypothesis confirmed during a research and the hypothesis is that a suitable activation declines dependence of an immobile patient on other people. According to my research the second hypothesis also confirmed and the hypothesis is that psycho-social patients conditions have improved through an activation therapy in different medical facilities. I have used a method of a survey with a help of questionnaire for getting needed facts to achieving goals and answering hypothesis of a quantitative survey. The questionnaire consisted of 18 questions focused on patients` activation in given wards, on kinds of activation, on aids and sufficient conditions for activation carrying out, on nurses` competence and on an influence of activation on a patients life quality. The questionnaire was given just to nurses and was anonymous. I have compared the results among given wards...|$|R
