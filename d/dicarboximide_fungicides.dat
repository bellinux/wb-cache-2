The MA T 1 - 1 and MA T 1 - 2 alleles were fairly evenly distributed among the field isolates from most countries. Seventy-six isolates displayed resistance to benzimidazole and/or <b>dicarboximide</b> <b>fungicides</b> due to mutant alleles of the Mbc 1 and/or Daf 1 genes. Unlike wild-type and low-resistant isolates, those carrying the high-resistance Mbc 1 HR alleles were sensitive to N-phenylcarbamates. With one exception, isolates carrying the high-resistance Daf 1 HR alleles were hypersensitive to media of high osmolarity.

40|$|Abstract: Iprodione (C 13 H 13 Cl 2 N 3 O 3) {{is a broad}} {{spectrum}} <b>dicarboximide</b> <b>fungicide</b> used {{on a wide variety}} of crop diseases. It is used on vegetables, ornamentals, pome and stone fruit, root crops, cotton and sunflowers, to control a variety of fungal pests. Iprodione inhibits the germination of spores and the growth of the fungal mycelium. Experimental studies with mice have indicated that exposure to iprodione at dose levels 5 to 15 folds greater than the LOAEL for liver injury, induces microsomal enzyme activities, hepatocyte proliferation, hepatomegaly, centrilobular hypertrophy, diffuse hypertrophy, and an increase in lauric acid hydroxylation. Currently, there is no toxicological data available on human health effects associated with exposure to iprodione. In this research, we performed the MTT Assay for cell viability to assess the cytotoxicity of iprodione, and the CAT-Tox (L) assay to measure the induction of stress genes in thirteen recombinant cell lines generated from human liver carcinoma cells (HepG 2).

The implication of EDs at low doses on adipocyte {{development has been}} poorly investigated. For instance, vinclozolin (V) is a <b>dicarboximide</b> <b>fungicide</b> widely used in agriculture since the 90 's, alone or in mixture with genistein (G), an isoflavonoid from Leguminosae. This study aims to identify the effect of vinclozolin alone or with genistein, on adipose tissue properties using cell culture. Methods: In steroid-free conditions, 3 T 3 -L 1 pre-adipocytes were induced to differentiate {{in the presence of}} EDs, singularly or in mixtures, for 2 days. DNA and triglyceride (TG) levels were measured on days 0, 2 and 8 of differentiation. Leptin secretion was measured only on the eighth day. Results: We show that low doses of G (25 µM) and V (0. 1 µM) inhibit pre-adipocytes differentiation. This inhibition has been represented by a decreasing in DNA content (µg/well) and decreasing in TG accumulation (mg/mL) in 3 T 3 -L 1 cells. Nevertheless, V increased the anti-adipogenic properties of G. Conclusion: This study confirms that EDs singularly or in mixtures, introduced during early stages of life, could affect the differentiation and the endocrine activity of adipocytes, and can act as potential factors for obesity...|$|R

The structural elucidation of by-products arising from the UV-visible photodegradation of procymidone has been investigated by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. The potential toxicities of photoproducts were estimated by in silico tests. METHODS: Aqueous solutions of procymidone were irradiated for up to 90 min in a self-made reactor equipped with a mercury lamp. Analyses were carried out on a gas chromatograph coupled with an ion trap mass spectrometer operated in electron ionization and methanol positive chemical ionization. Multistage collision-induced dissociation (CID) experiments were performed to establish dissociation pathways of ions. Toxicities of byproducts were estimated using the QSAR T. E. S. T. program. RESULTS: Sixteen photoproducts were investigated. Chemical structures were proposed mainly based on the interpretation of multistage CID experiments, but also on their relative retention times and kinetics data. These structures enabled photodegradation pathways to be suggested. Only three photoproducts remain present after 90 min of irradiation. Among them, 3, 5 -dichloroaniline presents a predicted rat LD 50 toxicity about ten times {{greater than that of}} procymidone.

This work aimed at evaluating post-acquisition data-mining tools for selective extraction of metabolite species from direct introduction high-resolution mass spectrometry data. Investigations were performed on spectral data in which seven metabolites of vinclozolin, a <b>dicarboximide</b> <b>fungicide</b> containing two chloride atoms, were previously manually identified. The spectral data obtained from direct introduction (DI) and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) detection were post-processed by plotting the mass defect profiles and applying various data-filtering methods based on accurate mass values. Exploration of mass defect profiles highlighted, in a specific plotting region, the presence of compounds containing common chemical elements and pairs of conjugated and non-conjugated metabolites resulting from classical metabolic pathways. Additionally, the judicious application of mass defect and/or isotope pattern filters removed many interfering ions from DI-HRMS data, greatly facilitating the detection of vinclozolin metabolites. Compared with previous results obtained by manual data treatment, three additional metabolites of vinclozolin were detected and putatively annotated. Tracking simultaneously several specific species could be efficiently performed using data-mining tools based on accurate mass values.

40|$|Azole-resistant mutants of Botrytis cinerea have a multidrug {{resistance}} phenotype since they exhibit cross-resistance to unrelated chemicals. These mutants also display {{resistance to the}} new azole fungicide oxpoconazole. Resistance to oxpoconazole is associated with decreased accumulation of the fungicide, {{which is the result}} of energy-dependent efflux mediated by fungicide transporters. The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter BcatrB (B. cinerea ABC transporter B), involved in efflux of phenylpyrrole fungicides, has no major role in efflux of oxpoconazole since accumulation of the fungicide by a replacement mutant of BcatrB showed a transient accumulation pattern {{similar to that of the}} wild-type isolate. The putative role of 10 additional ABC and 3 Major facilitator superfamily transporters in efflux of oxpoconazole was investigated by expression analysis of the corresponding genes. The basal transcription level of BcatrD in germlings of B. cinerea was correlated with the resistance level of two azole-resistant mutants. A short treatment of germlings with the azole fungicides oxpoconazole, prochloraz, and tebuconazole enhanced transcript levels of BcatrD in a wild-type isolate. Transcript levels induced by these fungicides in azole-resistant mutants also correlated with resistance levels. We propose that BcatrD is the ABC transporter that plays a role in azole sensitivity and azole resistance of B. cinerea. Expression of BcatrD is also induced by treatment of germlings with the <b>dicarboximide</b> <b>fungicide</b> iprodione, the benzimidazole fungicide carbendazim, and the antibiotic cycloheximide, suggesting that this gene indeed plays a role in {{multidrug resistance}} to fungicides...|$|R

In Ipr-N, fungal sporulation was inhibited by forming mostly undeveloped unicellular conidia with degraded and necrotic cytoplasm. However, in Ipr-I, conspicuous cellular changes occurred during sporulation by forming multicellular conidia with double layered (thickened) cell walls and accumulation of proliferated lipid bodies in the conidial cytoplasm, which may inhibit the penetration of the fungicide into conidial cells, reducing fungicide-associated toxicity, and may be utilized as energy and nutritional sources, respectively, for the further fungal growth to form mature colonies as in Ipr-G that formed multicellular conidia with cell walls and intact cytoplasm with lipid bodies as in Con-G...|$|R

40|$|Development in shiitake mushroom, Lentinula edodes, is {{a unique}} process and studies of the {{molecular}} basis of this process may lead to improvement in mushroom cultivation. Previous studies have {{identified a number of}} signal transduction genes related to mushroom development, but those genes have not been well characterized. The present work characterized a developmentally regulated MAP kinase, Le. MAPK, Histidine kinase Le. nik 1 and their interacting partners in the signal transduction pathways. Histidine kinase Le. nik 1 is the first Histidine kinase gene found in basidiomyces by differential display by RAP-PCR and it has a high sequence homology with the Histidine kinase from C. albicans and B. cinerea, which may be related to development and stress responses. A 7. 8 kb genomic DNA sequence and the full-length ORF of 6. 29 kb cDNA sequence of the two-component histidine kinase Le. nik 1 has been determined. Northern blot analysis and real time RT-PCR showed that the transcript expression level of Le. nik 1 increases from mycelium to mature fruiting body. This suggests that Le. nik 1 plays an essential role in fruiting body development. In situ hybridization of different fruiting body stage demonstrated the transcript localization of Le. nik 1 in the developing hymenophore and trama cells, which reveals Le. nik 1 's role in fruiting body development. Real time RT-PCR results suggest the relationship between Le. nik 1 and <b>dicarboximide</b> <b>fungicides</b> and oxidant. Yeast two-hybrid studies of Le. nik 1 response regulator yields two novel interacting protein and they may also be related to fruit body development as shown by real-time RT-PCR and in situ hybridization. Le. MAPK gene was isolated and identified by RNA fingerprinting of differentially expressed genes. Le. MAPK shows high sequence identity to the MAP kinase in other fungus includes U. maydis, N. crassa and S. cerevisiae. Le. MAPK was found to be interacting with Le. DRMIP from the yeast two hybrid analyses. Le. DRMIP is a novel gene with a predicted N-terminal mitochondrial signal peptide, suggesting that their interactions relate to the mitochondrial signaling pathway. The expression profiles of these two genes reveal their importance in fruiting body initiation and development; the Le. DRMIP transcript is localized predominantly in the developing young fruit body and gills, which further signifies its role in cell differentiation during mushroom development. These results suggest a model in which Le. MAPK and Le. DRMIP regulate mitochondrial signal transduction during fruit body development in L. edodes. Through the studies of Le. MAPK and Le. nik 1, this work enhances our knowledge of the role and functions of these signal transduction genes in mushroom development. These studies can also help us to investigate the biological function of these signal transduction genes in fungi and other organisms. Szeto Ying Ying. "October 2006. "Adviser: Hoi Shan Kwan.

40|$|Esca, {{known from}} Austria {{since it was}} {{reported}} by Zweigelt (1933), has increased in importance {{in the last ten}} years. Investigations on the incidence of esca were therefore undertaken to assess its impact on Austrian viticulture. A visual assessment of 14, 000 vines showed that about 1. 3 percent of plants exhibited external esca symptoms. This incidence was correlated with vineyard age, but not with the cultivar grown. The spatial dispersal of esca, investigated by monitoring contaminated vineyards, seemed to be random. Investigations on the temporal incidence of infestation revealed that the number of diseased plants increased dramatically within the time span studied. The average annual increase of plants with external esca symptoms in monitored vineyards was approximately 2. 7 percent. Further studies focused on certain phytopathological aspects, such as the effect of white-rot fungi and Phaeoacremonium chlamydosporum on disease incidence, and the control of Stereum hirsutum in vitro. The occurrence of basidiocarps of S. hirsutum, Trametes hirsuta and T. versicolor on diseased vines and the isolation of Phaeoacremonium spp. were documented in Austria for the first time. Inoculations of grapevines with S. hirsutum and P. chlamydosporum, either separately or in combination, failed to produce symptoms on leaves or berries. On the other hand, cross-sections of woody tissues showed a decayed zone in the pith when they had been inoculated with S. hirsutum, and P. chlamydosporum induced dark-brown necrosis in the wood. A combination of these two fungi caused only dark-brown necrosis, without wood decay, even though re-isolation corroborated the presence of both fungi. Various fungicides were evaluated for their efficacy against S. hirsutum in vitro. The most effective fungicide for inhibition of mycelial growth was the EBI fungicide fenarimol with an EC 50 value of 0. 002 mg a. i. ml- 1. The <b>dicarboximide</b> <b>fungicide</b> procymidone was less effective, with an EC 50 value of 80 mg a. i. ml- 1. The effects of benomyl and hydroxychinolin did not differ significantly when compared with the control...|$|R
40|$|Iprodione (C 13 H 13 Cl 2 N 3 O 3) {{is a broad}} {{spectrum}} <b>dicarboximide</b> <b>fungicide</b> used {{on a wide variety}} of crop diseases. It is used on vegetables, ornamentals, pome and stone fruit, root crops, cotton and sunflowers, to control a variety of fungal pests. Iprodione inhibits the germination of spores and the growth of the fungal mycelium. Experimental studies with mice have indicated that exposure to iprodione at dose levels 5 to 15 folds greater than the LOAEL for liver injury, induces microsomal enzyme activities, hepatocyte proliferation, hepatomegaly, centrilobular hypertrophy, diffuse hypertrophy, and an increase in lauric acid hydroxylation. Currently, there is no toxicological data available on human health effects associated with exposure to iprodione. In this research, we performed the MTT Assay for cell viability to assess the cytotoxicity of iprodione, and the CAT-Tox (L) assay to measure the induction of stress genes in thirteen recombinant cell lines generated from human liver carcinoma cells (HepG 2). The cytotoxicity data indicated a strong concentration - response relationship with regard to iprodione toxicity. The percentages of cell viability were 100 Ã‚Â± 0 %, 128. 0 Ã‚Â± 41. 4 %, 97. 5 Ã‚Â± 37. 7 %, 70. 1 Ã‚Â± 35. 4 %, 33. 5 Ã‚Â± 16. 1 %, and 5. 1 Ã‚Â± 3. 7 % in 0, 31. 3, 62. 5, 125, 250, and 500 ÃŽÂ¼g/mL, respectively. The LC 50 was 208. 3 Ã‚Â± 83. 3 ÃŽÂ¼g/mL. Data obtained from the CAT-Tox (L) assay showed that iprodione is able to induce a significant number of stress genes in HepG 2 cells. At 250 ug/mL exposure, the induction levels were 1. 2 Ã‚Â± 0. 4, 50. 1 Ã‚Â± 17. 8, 3. 9 Ã‚Â± 1. 2, 16. 8 Ã‚Â± 7. 2, 10. 7 Ã‚Â± 0. 7, 1. 8 Ã‚Â± 0, 26. 3 Ã‚Â± 10. 0, 7. 2 Ã‚Â± 2. 4, 1. 8 Ã‚Â± 0. 0, 6. 8 Ã‚Â± 1. 3, 6. 7 Ã‚Â± 0. 5, and 4. 3 Ã‚Â± 1. 8 for CYP 1 A 1, GSTYa, XRE, HMTIIA, c-fos, NF-kBRE, HSP 70, CRE, RARE, GADD 153, GADD 45, and GRP 78, respectively. These results indicate that the metabolism of iprodione involves Phase II biotransformation in the liver (XRE, GSTYa), and that this chemical has the potential to cause cell proliferation and/or inflammatory reactions (c-fos, NF-kB), proteotoxic effects (HSP 70, GRP 78), metabolic disruption (CRE), and DNA damage (GADD 45, GADD 153) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{filamentous}} ascomycete fungus Sclerotinia homoeocarpa causes dollar spot, {{which is}} the most important disease of turfgrasses in the United States. Despite the increased number of reports of site-specific fungicide resistance and a recent report of multidrug resistance (MDR) in S. homoeocarpa field populations, the genetic mechanisms behind resistance or reduced sensitivity to fungicides remain poorly explained in the fungus. In order to prevent further development of fungicide resistance in the dollar spot pathosystem, a detailed elucidation of mechanisms of site-specific fungicide resistance and MDR is needed. In addition, the previous studies of MDR in fungi mostly focused on efflux transporter mediated drug/xenobiotic detoxification. However, the recent release of fungal genome sequences has revealed that ascomycete filamentous fungi including S. homoeocarpa possess a large number of cytochrome p 450 s (CYP 450 s) that are involved in xenobiotic metabolism. Chapters 2 and 3 of this dissertation describe demethylation inhibitor (DMI) fungicide/MDR mechanisms in S. homoeocarpa through Phase I xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes (CYP 450 s) and Phase III efflux transporters using functional genomic and genetic techniques. We identified a fungal specific transcription factor (Shxdr 1) that regulates the Phase I and III genes and a novel gain of function mutation of the transcription factor found from a MDR field strain is responsible for constitutive and induced overexpression of the Phase I and III genes, resulting in MDR. In Chapter 4, the mechanisms of qualitative and quantitative resistance of a <b>dicarboximide</b> <b>fungicide</b> have been determined using field and lab mutant S. homoeocarpa strains. We confirmed that S. homoeocarpa field isolates gained qualitative and quantitative dicarboximide resistance through the polymorphism in the histidine kinase gene Shos 1 and the overexpression of ABC efflux transporter ShPDR 1, respectively. Chapter 5 studies the management of a S. homoeocarpa population with different combinations of resistance to dicarboximide, DMI, and benzimidazole fungicides to find the best fungicide options for controlling the S. homoeocarpa population and further understanding the dynamics of how the population responds to fungicide applications, and to long-term lack of exposure to fungicides during winter. Succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHI; fluxapyroxad and boscalid (high rate)), multi-site fungicide (fluazinam), and the fungicide mixture (chlorothalonil, iprodione, thiophanate methyl, and tebuconazole) controlled the S. homoeocarpa population very well. The isolates with resistance to DMI and dicarboximide were most frequently selected by iprodione or propiconazole applications and the isolates with resistance to DMI and benzimidazole were selected by boscalid applications, but these multiple fungicide resistant isolates decreased after overwintering...|$|R
40|$|Isolates of Monilinia fructicola (Wint.) Honey {{obtained}} from stone fruit orchards in Hawkes Bay, North Island and from Californian fruit exported to New Zealand, were tested for resistance to methyl benzimidazole carbamate (MBC). Resistant isolates from the North Island had EC₅₀ values of > 30, 000, and most isolates from the imported fruit had of values approximately 1. 5 mg a. i. /l carbendazim. Sensitive isolates failed to grow on 1 mg a. i. /l carbendazim. A detached peach shoot system {{was used in}} controlled conditions for estimation of values for incubation period, latent period and rate of spore production on flowers (cv Glohaven). The same variables {{and the rate of}} colonisation of host tissue were measured on fruit (cv Fantasia) in controlled conditions. An inoculum density of 1 x 10 ⁴ spore/flower or fruit greatly increased fitness in vivo compared to an inoculum density of 1 x 10 ² spore/flower (fruit). Isolates varied considerably, but there was no consistent relationship between the degrees of resistance and fitness. This was in contrast to earlier studies with dicarboximide resistant strains of M. fructicola. The survival in the field of 10 isolates resistant or sensitive to MBC or <b>dicarboximide</b> <b>fungicides</b> on twig cankers and mummified fruit was compared. The ability to produce conidia on twig cankers inoculated in late spring 1989 was maintained by all sensitive and MBC resistant isolates for at least 1 year. The production of conidia on mummified fruit inoculated in February 1990 decreased after 2 - 3 months in the field but some conidia were still produced on all fruit in the following spring. Dicarboximide resistant isolates produced less conidia than either the MBC resistant and the sensitive isolates. The pathogenicity and fitness of all isolates were similar to the original values after survival for 1 year. A technique was developed to produce apothecia reliably from inoculated peach (cv Black Boy) and nectarine (cv Fantasia) fruit in controlled conditions in the laboratory. The fruit were inoculated with resistant or sensitive isolates, or combinations, and were incubated for 8 weeks at 25 °C (± 1 °C) with 12 hours photoperiod of fluorescent light (Sylvania 2 x 65 W, daylight) to produce mummified fruit. The fruit were then buried in moist autoclaved peat moss for 10 weeks at 25 °C (± 1 °C) in the dark to form stromata. These fruit were then hydrated with running tap-water (total hardness (CaCO₃) = 47 g/m³ and conductivity at 20 °C = 12. 7 mS/m) for 72 hours. The hydrated mummified fruit were placed in moist peat moss and were incubated for 13 - 14 weeks at 8 °C (± 0. 5 °C) in the dark. At the end of this period, stipe initials were visible. Differentiation of stipe initials into mature apothecia occurred within 15 - 20 days after transfer to 12 °C (± 2 °C) with a 12 hour photoperiod of fluorescent and incandescent light. All isolates produced apothecia when treated in this way. A technique for isolation of ascospore sets in linear arrangement was developed for tetrad analysis of the inheritance of resistance. At least 3 hours of fluorescent and incandescent light at 12 °C (± 2 °C) was essential to allow ascospore ejection from individual asci taken from apothecia previously maintained in a 12 hour photoperiod at 12 °C (± 1 °C). A water film on the surface of water agar was necessary to hold a set of ejected ascospores in linear sequence. Single ascospores were obtained in sequence {{with the aid of a}} micromanipulator. Genetic analysis of MBC resistant isolates was carried out on ascospores derived from apothecia produced in the laboratory. Analysis of ascospore sets in linear arrangement and ascospore populations indicated that resistance to > 30, 000 mg a. i. /l carbendazim (high-resistant) is governed by a single major gene and is affected by gene conversion mechanisms. Crossing over was frequent, suggesting that recombination of resistance with other characters, such as pathogenicity and fitness, may occur readily. The segregation ratio (1 : 1) from most resistant isolates revealed that heterokaryons containing both resistant and sensitive alleles were common in resistant populations and that resistance is dominant. Allozyme analysis of ascospore progeny through electrophoresis revealed a narrow genetic base of M. fructicola in New Zealand. The technique for reliable apothecial production in controlled conditions developed in this study provided an important step for the determination of the biology of M. fructicola strains resistant to MBC fungicides, and the complexity of its life cycle. Genetic heterogeneity in field populations can be conserved in one isolate through heterokaryosis, thus providing for adaptability of the pathogen to the changing environmental conditions. Knowledge on genetic variability, overwintering ability, pathogenicity and fitness factors may be useful for future management strategies of stone fruit brown rot. Special emphasis should be made in particular to prevent primary infection on blossoms, which would delay the establishment of recombinant strains of M. fructicola and the onset of brown rot epidemics...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Studies {{report that}} {{residential}} {{use of pesticides}} in low-income homes is common because of poor housing conditions and pest infestations; however, exposure data on contemporary-use pesticides in low-income households is limited. We conducted a study in low-income homes from urban and agricultural communities to: characterize and compare house dust levels of agricultural and residential-use pesticides; evaluate the correlation of pesticide concentrations in samples collected several days apart; examine whether concentrations of pesticides phased-out for residential uses, but still used in agriculture (i. e., chlorpyrifos and diazinon) have declined in homes in the agricultural community; and estimate resident children's pesticide exposures via inadvertent dust ingestion. Methods In 2006, we collected up to two dust samples 5 - 8 days apart from each of 13 urban homes in Oakland, California and 15 farmworker homes in Salinas, California, an agricultural community (54 samples total). We measured 22 insecticides including organophosphates (chlorpyrifos, diazinon, diazinon-oxon, malathion, methidathion, methyl parathion, phorate, and tetrachlorvinphos) and pyrethroids (allethrin-two isomers, bifenthrin, cypermethrin-four isomers, deltamethrin, esfenvalerate, imiprothrin, permethrin-two isomers, prallethrin, and sumithrin), one phthalate herbicide (chlorthal-dimethyl), one <b>dicarboximide</b> <b>fungicide</b> (iprodione), and one pesticide synergist (piperonyl butoxide). Results More {{than half of the}} households reported applying pesticides indoors. Analytes frequently detected in both locations included chlorpyrifos, diazinon, permethrin, allethrin, cypermethrin, and piperonyl butoxide; no differences in concentrations or loadings were observed between locations for these analytes. Chlorthal-dimethyl was detected solely in farmworker homes, suggesting contamination due to regional agricultural use. Concentrations in samples collected 5 - 8 days apart in the same home were strongly correlated {{for the majority of the}} frequently detected analytes (Spearman &# 961; = 0. 70 - 1. 00, p < 0. 01). Additionally, diazinon and chlorpyrifos concentrations in Salinas farmworker homes were 40 - 80 % lower than concentrations reported in samples from Salinas farmworker homes studied between 2000 - 2002, suggesting a temporal reduction after their residential phase-out. Finally, estimated non-dietary pesticide intake for resident children did not exceed current U. S. Environmental Protection Agency's (U. S. EPA) recommended chronic reference doses (RfDs). Conclusion Low-income children are potentially exposed to a mixture of pesticides as a result of poorer housing quality. Historical or current pesticide use indoors is likely to contribute to ongoing exposures. Agricultural pesticide use may also contribute to additional exposures to some pesticides in rural areas. Although children's non-dietary intake did not exceed U. S. EPA RfDs for select pesticides, this does not ensure that children are free of any health risks as RfDs have their own limitations, and the children may be exposed indoors via other pathways.

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} of the present review is to analyze the molecular basis of fungicide resistance mechanism to both synthetic fungicides and the natural fungicides isothiocyanates. The review is focused mainly on Alternaria sp., but whenever available, similar studies in other fungi have been included. Fungal resistant strains to <b>dicarboximide</b> and phenylpyrrole <b>fungicides</b> {{have been found to}} contain mutations in one of the proteins involved in the signal transduction pathway that regulates the fungal response to osmotic stress. By the other hand, it was found that isothiocyanates induce enzymes like glutathione S-transferase, cyanide hydratase, heat shock proteins, membrane transporters and proteins associated with the oxidative stress response. Also, inter simple sequence repeats polymorphism was recorded {{as a response to the}} isothiocyanates treatment. The knowledge about the genetic basis of the response mechanism of Alternaria sp. to the isothiocyanates is scarce. Therefore, studies by DNA recombinant technology to analyze the fungi responses to fungicides, will allow knowing the metabolic pathways involved in the phenomena to permit the design of strategies to inhibit key reactions involved in the fungal resistance, reaching a better and sustainable funga...|$|R
40|$|Managing dollar spot, {{the most}} common and chronic disease on intensively {{cultivated}} turfgrass, relies on the judicious use of fungicides. The heavy use of fungicides has {{led to the development of}} isolates of Sclerotinia homoeocarpa insensitive to several classes of fungicides, including benzimidazoles, demethylation-inhibitors, and <b>dicarboximides.</b> In vitro <b>fungicide</b> sensitivity assays using single discriminatory concentrations of thiophanate-methyl, propiconazole, and iprodione were developed in this study for evaluating field efficacy of these fungicides and the prevalence of fungicide insensitivity within S. homoeocarpa isolated from golf courses throughout Ohio. Discriminatory concentrations for these fungicides were determined to be: thiophanate-methyl = 1, 000 μg a. i. ml– 1, propiconazole = 0. 1 μg a. i. ml– 1, and iprodione = 1. 0 μg a. i. ml– 1. Effective concentration that produces 50 % inhibition (EC 50) was estimated based on relative mycelial growth of S. homoeocarpa on potato dextrose agar (PDA) versus PDA amended with the discriminatory concentration of each fungicide. Field trials conducted at 3 locations in 2002 and 10 locations in 2003 revealed that the in vitro assays accurately predicted field efficacy for thiophanate-methyl. When used to screen 192 S. homoeocarpa isolates collected previously from 55 golf courses throughout Ohio, the in vitro assays revealed that 34 of the golf courses sampled had S. homoeocarpa resistant to thiophanate-methyl. S. homoeocarpa with reduced in vitro sensitivities was isolated from 18 and 1 golf courses for propiconazole and iprodione, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{tangerine}} pathotype of Alternaria alternata is a necrotrophic fungal pathogen causing {{brown spot}} disease {{on a number}} of citrus cultivars. To better understand the dynamics of signal regulation leading to oxidative and osmotic stress response and fungal infection on citrus, phenotypic characterization of the yeast SSK 1 response regulator homolog was performed. It was determined that SSK 1 responds to diverse environmental stimuli and plays a critical role in fungal pathogenesis. Experiments to determine the phenotypes resulting from the loss of SSK 1 reveal that the SSK 1 gene product may be fulfilling similar regulatory roles in signaling pathways involving a HOG 1 MAP kinase during ROS resistance, osmotic resistance, fungicide sensitivity and fungal virulence. The SSK 1 mutants display elevated sensitivity to oxidants, fail to detoxify H 2 O 2 effectively, induce minor necrosis on susceptible citrus leaves, and displays resistance to <b>dicarboximide</b> and phenylpyrrole <b>fungicides.</b> Unlike the SKN 7 response regulator, SSK 1 and HOG 1 confer resistance to salt-induced osmotic stress via an unknown kinase sensor rather than the "two component" histidine kinase HSK 1. SSK 1 and HOG 1 play a moderate role in sugar-induced osmotic stress. We also show that SSK 1 mutants are impaired in their ability to produce germ tubes from conidia, indicating a role for the gene product in cell differentiation. SSK 1 also is involved in multi-drug resistance. However, deletion of the yeast SHO 1 (synthetic high osmolarity) homolog resulted in no noticeable phenotypes. Nonetheless, our results show that A. alternata can sense and react to different types of stress via SSK 1, HOG 1 and SKN 7 in a cooperative manner leading to proper physiological and pathological functions...|$|R
