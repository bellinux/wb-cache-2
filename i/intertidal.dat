5|$|Bronze Age barrows at Selworthy Beacon and an Iron Age {{enclosure}} at Furzebury Brake, west of {{the town}} show evidence of prehistoric occupation of the area, although there is also possible evidence in the <b>intertidal</b> area, where {{the remains of a}} submerged forest still exist.|$|E
5|$|Females {{can produce}} up to 185,000 eggs, and larvae develop {{offshore}} {{in several stages}} before their final moult to juvenile crabs in the <b>intertidal</b> zone. Young crabs live among seaweeds and seagrasses, such as Posidonia oceanica, until they reach adulthood.|$|E
5|$|The park hosts a {{wide range}} of upland and wetland vegetation. Algae and <b>intertidal</b> plants {{can be found at the}} shore {{including}} salt meadow grass, sedge, and sphagnum moss; the park's swampy areas have red maple and tulip trees; the upland sections include cherry, hickory, and shrubs.|$|E
5|$|Three {{areas of}} land are {{protected}} for their ecological or geological interest as Sites of Special Interest (SSI). Jersey has four designated Ramsar sites: Les Pierres de Lecq, Les Minquiers, Les Écréhous and Les Dirouilles {{and the south}} east coast of Jersey (a large area of <b>intertidal</b> zone).|$|E
5|$|Habitat types include polar, temperate, {{subtropical}} and tropical. The terrestrial {{vegetation type}} may be forest, steppe, grassland, semi-arid or desert. Fresh water habitats include marshes, streams, rivers, lakes, ponds and estuaries, and marine habitats include salt marshes, the coast, the <b>intertidal</b> zone, reefs, bays, the open sea, the sea bed, deep water and submarine vents.|$|E
5|$|Many {{carnivorous}} marine gastropods {{are known}} predators of L.canarium, including the volutes Cymbiola nobilis and Melo melo and the cone snail (Conus textile). The dog conch is also preyed upon by vertebrates. These include the crab-eating macaque, Macaca fascicularis, an opportunistic predator that scours <b>intertidal</b> environments. Humans {{are one of}} the dog conch's main predators, subjecting the species to intensive fishing and exploitation.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses inhabit various {{regions of}} the ocean, {{including}} coral reefs, pelagic waters, and the seabed; some live in the <b>intertidal</b> zone and others at abyssal depths. Most species grow fast, mature early and are short-lived. During breeding, the male uses a specially adapted arm to deliver a bundle of sperm directly into the female's mantle cavity, after which he becomes senescent and dies. The female deposits fertilised eggs in a den and cares for them until they hatch, after which she also dies.|$|E
5|$|Scientist Bill Austin of Khoyatan Marine Lab in the Northeast Pacific {{examined}} a video {{made during the}} National Geographic dives to identify the benthic flora and fauna of Bowie Seamount. From the video, Austin recognized {{some of the most}} noticeable invertebrates and noted that a few species generally occurring in the <b>intertidal</b> zone and in shallow subtidal environments were found deeper than might normally be expected, and were bigger than normal.|$|E
5|$|Stephen Hillenburg {{first became}} {{fascinated with the}} ocean and began {{developing}} his artistic abilities as a child. During college, he majored in marine biology and minored in art. After graduating in 1984, he joined the Ocean Institute, an ocean education organization, where he had the idea to create a comic book titled The <b>Intertidal</b> Zone, {{which led to the}} creation of SpongeBob SquarePants. In 1987, Hillenburg left the Institute to pursue a career in animation.|$|E
5|$|While Hillenburg was there, {{his love}} of the ocean began to {{influence}} his artistry. He created a precursor to SpongeBob SquarePants: a comic book titled The <b>Intertidal</b> Zone, which {{was used by the}} institute to teach visiting students about the animal life of tide pools. The comic starred various anthropomorphic sea lifeforms, many of which would evolve into SpongeBob SquarePants characters. Hillenburg tried to get the comic professionally published, but none of the companies that he sent it to were interested.|$|E
5|$|A {{few years}} after {{studying}} experimental animation at the California Institute of the Arts, Hillenburg met Joe Murray, creator of the Nickelodeon series Rocko's Modern Life, at an animation festival, and was offered {{a job as a}} director of the show. Martin Olson, one of the writers for Rocko's Modern Life, read The <b>Intertidal</b> Zone and encouraged Hillenburg to create a television series with a similar concept. At that point, Hillenburg had not even considered creating his own series. However, he realized that if he ever did, this would be the best approach. Production on Rocko's Modern Life ended in 1996. Shortly afterwards, Hillenburg began working on SpongeBob SquarePants.|$|E
5|$|Active-swimming predators, {{groups of}} leopard sharks often follow the tide onto <b>intertidal</b> mudflats to forage for food, mainly clams, spoon worms, crabs, shrimp, bony fish, and fish eggs. Most leopard sharks tend to remain within a {{particular}} area rather than undertaking long movements elsewhere, {{which has led to}} genetic divergence between populations of sharks living in different regions. This species is aplacental viviparous, meaning that the young hatch inside the uterus and are nourished by yolk. From March to June, the female gives birth to as many as 37 young after a gestation period of 10–12 months. It is relatively slow-growing and takes many years to mature.|$|E
5|$|Born in Lawton, Oklahoma {{and raised}} in Anaheim, California, Hillenburg became fascinated with the ocean {{as a child and}} also {{developed}} an interest in art. He started his professional career in 1984, instructing marine biology, at the Orange County Marine Institute, where he wrote The <b>Intertidal</b> Zone, an informative comic book about tide-pool animals, which he used to educate his students. In 1989, two years after leaving teaching, Hillenburg enrolled at the California Institute of the Arts to pursue a career in animation. He was later offered a job on the Nickelodeon animated television series Rocko's Modern Life (19931996) after his success with short films The Green Beret and Wormholes (both 1992), which he made while studying animation.|$|E
5|$|Both Neotrypaea californiensis and the {{mud shrimp}} Upogebia pugettensis live in mudflats and sandy {{substrates}} in the <b>intertidal</b> zone of estuaries in western North America. N.californiensis is found from Mutiny Bay, Alaska to Punta Abreojos, Mulegé, Baja California Sur, Mexico. Its habitat {{is also used}} for the aquaculture of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas. Since the bioturbation carried out by N.californiensis and U. pugettensis reduces the productivity of the oyster beds, they are considered pests. Their effects may, however, have knock-on effects across the entire ecosystem, and may buffer it from the hazards of nutrient enrichment and increase primary and secondary productivity by {{increasing the amount of}} dissolved inorganic nitrogen.|$|E
5|$|Hunting along {{migration}} routes threatens some bird species. The {{populations of}} Siberian cranes (Leucogeranus leucogeranus) that wintered in India declined due to hunting along the route, particularly in Afghanistan and Central Asia. Birds were last seen in their favourite wintering grounds in Keoladeo National Park in 2002. Structures such as power lines, wind farms and offshore oil-rigs {{have also been}} known to affect migratory birds. Other migration hazards include pollution, storms, wildfires, and habitat destruction along migration routes, denying migrants food at stopover points. For example, in the East Asian–Australasian Flyway, up to 65% of key <b>intertidal</b> habitat at the Yellow Sea migration bottleneck has been destroyed since the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|In the Cretaceous, {{a shallow}} seaway spread into the {{interior}} of North America from the Gulf of Mexico in the south into Utah and later to the Arctic Ocean in the far north. Geologists call this shallow sea the Cretaceous Seaway or Western Interior Seaway. The seaway divided North America into two halves: an eastern portion dominated by the already ancient Appalachian Mountains and a western part composed primarily of the still growing Sevier Mountains; formed from shallow thrust faulting caused by the Sevier orogeny. As the shoreline moved back and forth, the Bryce area alternated from {{being part of the}} Sevier landmass to being under the Cretaceous Seaway. Alternating layers of nonmarine, <b>intertidal,</b> and marine sediments lay {{on top of each other}} as a result.|$|E
5|$|Leptostraca is {{the only}} extant order of Phyllocarida, the other two orders, Archaeostraca and Hoplostraca being extinct. Leptostracans {{are thought to be}} the most {{primitive}} of the malacostracans and date back to the Cambrian period. They range in length from , most being suspension feeders though some are carnivores or scavengers. They have a two part carapace which encloses the head, the whole thorax and part of the abdomen and are the only malcostracans with seven abdominal segments. Three families are known with several genera and about twenty species. They are found worldwide from the <b>intertidal</b> zone to the deep ocean, all but one species being benthic (living on the seabed).|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the ideas}} for the series {{originated}} in an unpublished educational comic book titled The <b>Intertidal</b> Zone, which Hillenburg created in 1989. He began developing SpongeBob SquarePants into a television series in 1996 upon the cancellation of Rocko's Modern Life, and turned to Tom Kenny, {{who had worked with}} him on that series, to voice the title character. SpongeBob was originally going to be named SpongeBoy, and the series was to be called SpongeBoy Ahoy!, but both of these were changed, as the name was already trademarked.|$|E

5|$|SpongeBob SquarePants is an American {{animated}} {{television series}} created by marine biologist and animator Stephen Hillenburg for Nickelodeon. The series {{is set in}} the fictional underwater city of Bikini Bottom, and centers on the adventures and endeavors of SpongeBob SquarePants, an over-optimistic sea sponge that annoys other characters. Many of the ideas for the show originated in an unpublished, educational comic book titled The <b>Intertidal</b> Zone, which Hillenburg created in the mid-1980s. He began developing SpongeBob SquarePants into a television series in 1996 after the cancellation of Rocko's Modern Life, another Nickelodeon television series that Hillenburg previously directed.|$|E

5|$|The {{bivalves}} are {{a highly}} successful class of invertebrates found in aquatic habitats throughout the world. Most are infaunal and live buried in sediment on the seabed, or in the sediment in freshwater habitats. A large number of bivalve species {{are found in the}} <b>intertidal</b> and sublittoral zones of the oceans. A sandy sea beach may superficially appear to be devoid of life, but often {{a very large number of}} bivalves and other invertebrates are living beneath the surface of the sand. On a large beach in South Wales, careful sampling produced an estimate of 1.44 million cockles (Cerastoderma edule) per acre of beach.|$|E
5|$|The <b>intertidal</b> mud flats {{of the bay}} have a {{long history}} of use for fishing, with {{structures}} on Stert Flats being dated by dendrochronological analysis to between 932 and 966. It is the last site in England used for 'mudhorse fishing' in which a wooden sledge is propelled across the mudflats to collect fish from nets. Catches include: Thinlip mullet, plaice, dogfish, cuttlefish, skate, shrimp, prawns, sea bass, and sole. Watchet Boat Museum displays the unusual local flatner boats which were used for fishing in the bay, along with associated artefacts.|$|E
5|$|As {{marine mammal}} species often play {{a large part}} in their ecosystems, it is {{possible}} that the sea mink was an important <b>intertidal</b> predator. It may have had a similar diet to the American mink, and may have consumed seabirds, seabird eggs, and hard-bodied marine invertebrates, though in greater proportions. Fur traders reported that sea mink dens had two entrances, and were made in the rocks piled up by the waves. Remains of toad sculpins and ocean pout were the most common around their dens, and garden banded snails were also reported to have been part of their diet. Their seafood-oriented diet may have increased their size. According to fur traders, the sea mink was nocturnal and resided in caves and rock crevices during the day. Due to the overlap of American mink and sea mink ranges, {{it is possible that}} they hybridized with each other. Although not a truly marine species, being confined to coastal waters, the sea mink was unusually aquatic compared to other members of Musteloidea, being, next to otters, the most aquatic member of the taxon.|$|E
5|$|Widespread in the nearshore {{waters of}} the {{tropical}} Indo-Pacific region, the bluespotted ribbontail ray has a range that extends around {{the periphery of the}} Indian Ocean from South Africa to the Arabian Peninsula to Southeast Asia, including Madagascar, Mauritius, Zanzibar, the Seychelles, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives. It is rare in the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman. In the Pacific Ocean, this species is found from the Philippines to northern Australia, as well as around numerous Melanesian and Polynesian islands as far east as the Solomon Islands. Rarely found deeper than , the bluespotted ribbontail ray is a bottom-dwelling species that frequents coral reefs and adjacent sandy flats. It is also commonly encountered in the <b>intertidal</b> zone and tidal pools, and has been sighted near seagrass beds. Every summer, considerable numbers of bluespotted ribbontail rays arrive off South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Bears, {{both black}} and brown, are seen in Glacier Bay in the <b>intertidal</b> zone which they {{frequent}} for foraging. They are also seen “scraping barnacles off of rocks and munching mussels.” Invariably they are spotted wandering alone along the beaches of the Glacier Bay in search of salmon. The habitats of the black bears are generally the southern forested areas of the bay. However, the brown bears are mostly found in the northern, more recently glaciated zones of the Glacier Bay. Occasionally, black bears are sighted near the glaciers or near Gustavus town. Black bears with black dots and brown bears with brown dots have been {{seen over the last}} 10 years. Their travel routes have been identified as along the easy tracks such as along beaches, stream beds and river valleys. The most commonly identified locations for sighting bears in the Glacier Bay are: The Bartlett Cove, the Bartlett River, the Beardslee Islands and North and South Sandy Cove locations for black bears, while brown bears are seen to the north of Tidal Inlet in the west arm of glacier and north of Adams Inlet in the east arm. They are also seen swimming in the Bay, crossing from one bank to the other. Salmon are their favorite food, apart from bumblebees, sand fleas, bird eggs, birds, voles and marine mammal carcasses.|$|E
5|$|Caddisfly larvae are aquatic, {{with six}} pairs of {{tracheal}} gills {{on the underside}} of the abdomen. The eggs are laid above water on emergent twigs or vegetation or on the water surface although females of some species enter water to choose sites. Although most species lay eggs, a few in the genus Triplectides are ovoviviparous. Some species lay eggs on land and although most are associated with freshwater, a few like Symphitoneuria are found in coastal saline water. Philanisus plebeius females lay their eggs into the coelomic cavity of <b>intertidal</b> starfish. The larvae are long and roughly cylindrical, very similar to those of lepidoptera but lacking prolegs. In case-bearing species, the heads are heavily sclerotinised while the abdomen is soft; the antennae are short and the mouthparts adapted for biting. Each of the usually ten abdominal segments bears a pair of legs with a single tarsal joint. In case-bearing species, the first segment bears three papillae, one above and two at the sides, which anchor the larva centrally in the tube. The posterior segment bears a pair of hooks for grappling. There are five to seven larval instars, followed by an aquatic pupa which has functional mandibles (to cut through the case), gills, and swimming legs.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bivalves}} adopt a sedentary or even sessile lifestyle, often {{spending their}} whole lives {{in the area in}} which they first settled as juveniles. The majority of bivalves are infaunal, living under the seabed, buried in soft substrates such as sand, silt, mud, gravel, or coral fragments. Many of these live in the <b>intertidal</b> zone where the sediment remains damp even when the tide is out. When buried in the sediment, burrowing bivalves are protected from the pounding of waves, desiccation, and overheating during low tide, and variations in salinity caused by rainwater. They are also {{out of the reach of}} many predators. Their general strategy is to extend their siphons to the surface for feeding and respiration during high tide, but to descend to greater depths or keep their shell tightly shut when the tide goes out. They use their muscular foot to dig into the substrate. To do this, the animal relaxes its adductor muscles and opens its shell wide to anchor itself in position while it extends its foot downwards into the substrate. Then it dilates the tip of its foot, retracts the adductor muscles to close the shell, shortens its foot and draws itself downwards. This series of actions is repeated to dig deeper.|$|E
25|$|<b>Intertidal</b> ecology is {{the study}} of <b>intertidal</b> ecosystems, where organisms live between the low and high tide lines. At low tide, the <b>intertidal</b> is exposed whereas at high tide, the <b>intertidal</b> is underwater. <b>Intertidal</b> ecologists {{therefore}} study the interactions between <b>intertidal</b> organisms and their environment, as well as between different species of <b>intertidal</b> organisms within a particular <b>intertidal</b> community. The most important environmental and species interactions may vary based on the type of <b>intertidal</b> community being studied, the broadest of classifications being based on substrates - rocky shore and soft bottom communities.|$|E
25|$|<b>Intertidal</b> ecology is {{the study}} of {{ecosystems}} between the low- and high-water lines along a shore. At low water, the <b>intertidal</b> zone is exposed (or emersed), whereas at high water, it is underwater (or immersed). <b>Intertidal</b> ecologists therefore study the interactions between <b>intertidal</b> organisms and their environment, as well as among the different species. The most important interactions may vary according to the type of <b>intertidal</b> community. The broadest classifications are based on substrates — rocky shore or soft bottom.|$|E
25|$|<b>Intertidal</b> {{fish are}} fish that {{move in and}} out with the tide in the <b>intertidal</b> zone of the seashore, or are found in rock pools or under rocks.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to being shaped by aspects of climate, <b>intertidal</b> habitats—especially <b>intertidal</b> zonation patterns—are strongly influenced by species interactions, such as predation, competition, facilitation, and indirect interactions. Ultimately, these interactions feed into the food web structure, described above. <b>Intertidal</b> habitats have been a model system for many classic ecological studies, including those introduced below, because the resident communities are particularly amenable to experimentation.|$|E
25|$|Marine mussels are {{abundant}} in the low and mid <b>intertidal</b> zone in temperate seas globally. Other species of marine mussel live in tropical <b>intertidal</b> areas, {{but not in the}} same huge numbers as in temperate zones.|$|E
25|$|<b>Intertidal</b> {{regions are}} {{utilized}} by humans {{for food and}} recreation, but anthropogenic actions also have major impacts, with overexploitation, invasive species and climate change being among the problems faced by <b>intertidal</b> communities. In some places Marine Protected Areas have been established to protect these areas and aid in scientific research.|$|E
25|$|Rock oysters {{are found}} {{naturally}} in the <b>intertidal</b> {{zone in the}} north of the North Island, and were subject to early cultivation experiments. During the 1960s, commercial farmers grew rock oysters on sticks coated with cement, and laid in racks in the lower <b>intertidal</b> regions of harbours and inlets around the northern North Island.|$|E
