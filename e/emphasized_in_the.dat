5|$|Narihira {{combined}} all {{the qualities}} most admired in a Heian courtier: {{he was of}} high birth (a grandson of the Emperor Heizei), extremely handsome, a gifted poet, and an all-conquering lover. He was probably also an expert horseman, adept in arms, and a competent official. These aspects of his life are not <b>emphasized</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Tales of Ise, but they distinguish Narihira from other heroes of Heian literature, including Genji.|$|E
5|$|While Sheridan and Pintchman both affirm Bryant's view, {{the latter}} {{adds that the}} Vedantic view <b>emphasized</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bhagavata is non-dualist with a difference.

5|$|Like other Ojibwe dialects, Ottawa grammar {{includes}} animate and inanimate noun gender, subclasses of verbs {{that are}} dependent upon gender, combinations of prefixes and suffixes that are connected with particular verb subclasses, and complex patterns of word formation. Ottawa distinguishes {{two types of}} third person in sentences: proximate, indicating a noun phrase that is <b>emphasized</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> discourse, and obviative, indicating a noun phrase that is less prominent. Ottawa has relatively flexible word order compared with languages such as English.|$|E

5|$|Most {{moments in}} which there is a fantastic {{occurrence}} constitute a change in point of view, from the omniscient narrator to a specific character with particular beliefs. The introduction of magical events from the perspective of the slaves highlights their otherness, because while they may believe, for instance, that Macandal survived his execution, the whites, and especially the readers, know that he did not. The marvellous, <b>emphasized</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Prologue, is a product of the characters' beliefs, which is why there is the shift in perspectives when presenting it.|$|E
5|$|In 1886, a bill {{to reduce}} the tariff was {{narrowly}} defeated in the House. The tariff issue was <b>emphasized</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Congressional elections that year, and the forces of protectionism increased their numbers in the Congress, but Cleveland continued to advocate tariff reform. As the surplus grew, Cleveland and the reformers called for a tariff for revenue only. His message to Congress in 1887 (quoted at right) highlighted the injustice of taking more money from the people than the government needed to pay its operating expenses. Republicans, as well as protectionist northern Democrats like Samuel J. Randall, believed that American industries would fail without high tariffs, and they continued to fight reform efforts. Roger Q. Mills, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, proposed {{a bill to}} reduce the tariff from about 47% to about 40%. After significant exertions by Cleveland and his allies, the bill passed the House. The Republican Senate failed to come to agreement with the Democratic House, and the bill died in the conference committee. Dispute over the tariff persisted into the 1888 presidential election.|$|E
5|$|In The King of Fighters XIII, Iori's {{gameplay}} mechanics were {{modified to}} {{be a close}} range fighter. Despite losing his flaming techniques, he was given brutal moves using his nails to emphasize his character's ferociousness. His strongest technique in the game, , is a new move that focuses on violent combos {{and serves as a}} reference to the character's ending from The King of Fighters '96 in which he brutally murders his teammates. Iori's 10th color scheme in the game matches his classic outfit's scheme, and during development of the game, details were added to increase the similarities. The ending of the character {{at the end of the}} game was also pointed by developers as something to look forward to. His version, featuring his classic techniques, was designed with the intention of not surpassing the current Iori so that players would choose the fighting style they prefer in the game. This was further <b>emphasized</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> console version of The King of Fighters XIII where Iori had his moveset adjusted for better balancing by not using flaming techniques.|$|E

5|$|The season {{followed}} {{the continuation of}} the surgical residency of five young interns, as they experience the demands of the competitive field of medicine, which becomes defining in their personal evolution. Although set in fictional Seattle Grace Hospital, located in Seattle, Washington, filming primarily occurred in Los Angeles, California. Whereas the first season mainly focused on the impact the surgical field has on the main characters, and the second one provided a detailed perspective on the physicians' private lives, the third season deals with the tough challenges brought by the last phase of the surgeons' internship, combining the professional motif <b>emphasized</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first season, with the complex personal background used in the second. Through the season, several new storylines are introduced, including the arrival of Dane's character, Dr. Mark Sloan, conceived and introduced as an antagonizing presence.|$|E

25|$|The Soviet {{establishment}} under General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev's leadership {{clashed with}} the churches in 1958–1964, a period when atheism was <b>emphasized</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> educational curriculum, and numerous state publications promoted atheistic views. During this period, the number of churches fell from 20,000 to 10,000 from 1959 to 1965, {{and the number of}} synagogues dropped from 500 to 97.

(Later, however, when Gigi pursued jazz as a career, his mother and older sisters would support him personally and financially.) Many of the Grice children were encouraged to pursue vocal performance at church, school, and other community; for a time the family even held weekly recitals in their home.|$|E

25|$|In 1401, the English case Beaulieu v Finglam imposed strict {{liability}} for the escape of fire; additionally, {{strict liability}} was imposed {{for the release}} of cattle. Negligently handling fire was of particular importance in these societies given capacity for destruction and relatively limited firefighting resources. Liability for common carrier, which arose around 1400, was also <b>emphasized</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> medieval period. Unintentional injuries were relatively infrequent in the medieval period. As transportation improved and carriages became popular in the 18th and 19th centuries, however, collisions and carelessness became more prominent in court records. In general, scholars of England such as William Blackstone took a hostile view to litigation, and rules against champerty and maintenance and vexatious litigation existed. The restriction on assignment of a cause of action is a related rule based on public policy.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the legal}} {{reforms of the}} late 1970s and 1980s, the Communist Party of China (CPC) has officially moved to embrace the {{language}} {{of the rule of law}} and to establish a modern court system. In the process, it has enacted thousands of new laws and regulations, and has begun training more legal professionals. The concept of 'rule of law' has been <b>emphasized</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> constitution, and the ruling party has embarked on campaigns to promote the idea that citizens have protection under the law. At the same time, however, a fundamental contradiction exists in the constitution itself, in which the Communist Party insists that its authority supersedes that of the law. Thus, the constitution enshrines the rule of law, yet simultaneously stresses the principle that the 'leadership of the Communist Party' holds primacy over the law.|$|E
25|$|Discussion of {{the racial}} {{elements}} of the case continued long after the trial's end. Some polls and some commentators have concluded that many blacks, while having their doubts as to Simpson's innocence, were more inclined to be suspicious of the credibility and fairness of {{the police and the}} courts, and thus more likely to question the evidence. The LAPD had a history of abusing African Americans in the city, which was <b>emphasized</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Rodney King case. After the civil trial verdict against Simpson, most whites surveyed said they believed justice had been served. Most blacks (75%) disagreed with the verdict and believed that it was racially motivated. An NBC poll taken in 2004 reported that, although 77% of 1,186 people sampled thought Simpson was guilty, only 27% of blacks in the sample believed so, compared to 87% of whites. The Simpson case continues to be assessed through the lens of race. In 2016, FiveThirtyEight reported that most black people now think O.J. was guilty.|$|E

25|$|In {{relation}} to burial practices, the Philippine culture has borrowed heavily from the Americans. In the Philippine wake for example, {{it is in}} tradition that the family and friends hold {{the body of the}} deceased in a casket for 5 to 7 days for viewing; this is patterned from the Visitation practiced also in American wakes, in which they host the deceased's body clothed and treated with various cosmetics in a funeral home for display and presentability. Both cultures adapting to a similar execution of ritual grief. Another turning point courtesy of the American influence is the practice of cremation. Drawing heavily from the Catholic faith, many Filipinos do not practice cremation as they believe that the body must remain intact in order to fulfil and prepare for the resurrection of the dead. Filipinos claimed that cremation must not be observed due to the Catholic church banning this practice, however as early as 1963 the ban was lifted and this point was <b>emphasized</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1983 revised Canon Law.|$|E
25|$|Hughes {{stressed}} {{a racial}} consciousness and cultural nationalism devoid of self-hate. His thought united people of African descent and Africa {{across the globe}} to encourage pride in their diverse black folk culture and black aesthetic. Hughes {{was one of the}} few prominent black writers to champion racial consciousness as a source of inspiration for black artists. His African-American race consciousness and cultural nationalism would influence many foreign black writers, including Jacques Roumain, Nicolás Guillén, Léopold Sédar Senghor, and Aimé Césaire. Along with the works of Senghor, Césaire, and other French-speaking writers of Africa and of African descent from the Caribbean, such as René Maran from Martinique and Léon Damas from French Guiana in South America, the works of Hughes helped to inspire the Négritude movement in France. A radical black self-examination was <b>emphasized</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face of European colonialism. In addition to his example in social attitudes, Hughes had an important technical influence by his emphasis on folk and jazz rhythms as the basis of his poetry of racial pride.|$|E
25|$|On February 2, 1967, Roy O. Disney held a {{press conference}} at the Park Theatres in Winter Park, Florida. The role of EPCOT was <b>emphasized</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film that was played. After the film, it was {{explained}} that for Disney World, including EPCOT, to succeed, a special district would have to be formed: the Reedy Creek Improvement District with two cities inside it, Bay Lake and Reedy Creek, now Lake Buena Vista. In addition to the standard powers of an incorporated city, which include the issuance of tax-free bonds, the district would have immunity from any current or future county or state land-use laws. The only areas where the district had to submit to the county and state would be property taxes and elevator inspections. The legislation forming the district and the two cities was signed into law by Florida Governor Claude R. Kirk, Jr. on May 12, 1967. The Supreme Court of Florida then ruled in 1968 that the district was allowed to issue tax-exempt bonds for public projects within the district, despite the sole beneficiary being Walt Disney Productions.|$|E
