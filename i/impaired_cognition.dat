50|$|The {{human brain}} {{is one of}} the most metabolically active organs in the body and metabolizes a large amount of glucose to produce {{cellular}} energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Despite its high energy demands, the brain is relatively inflexible in its ability to utilize substrates for energy production and relies almost entirely on circulating glucose for its energy needs. This dependence on glucose puts the brain at risk if the supply of glucose is interrupted, or if its ability to metabolize glucose becomes defective. If the brain is not able to produce ATP, synapses cannot be maintained and cells cannot function, ultimately leading to <b>impaired</b> <b>cognition.</b>|$|E
50|$|Camazepam, {{like others}} benzodiazepines, produce {{a variety of}} {{therapeutic}} and adverse effects by binding to the benzodiazepine receptor site on the GABAA receptor and modulating {{the function of the}} GABA receptor, the most prolific inhibitory receptor within the brain. The GABA chemical and receptor system mediates inhibitory or calming effects of camazepam on the nervous system.Compared to other benzodiazepines, it has reduced side effects such as <b>impaired</b> <b>cognition,</b> reaction times and coordination. which makes it best suited as an anxiolytic because of these reduced sides effects.Animal studies have shown camazepam and its active metabolites possess anticonvulsant properties.Unlike other benzodiazepines it does not disrupt normal sleep patterns. Camazepam has been shown in animal experiments to have a very low affinity for benzodiazepine receptors compared to other benzodiazepines. Compared to temazepam, camazepam has shown roughly equal anxiolytic properties, and less anticonvulsant, sedative and motor-impairing properties.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the {{development}} of a symptom complex that is specific to anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, people may experience prodromal symptoms, including headaches, flu-like illness, or symptoms similar to an upper respiratory infection. These symptoms may be present for weeks or months prior to disease onset. Beyond the prodromal symptoms, the disease progresses at varying rates, and patients may present with a variety of neurologic symptoms. During the initial stage of the disease, symptoms vary slightly between children and adults. However, behavior changes are a common first symptom within both groups. These changes often include agitation, paranoia, psychosis, and violent behaviors. Other common first manifestations include seizures and bizarre movements, mostly of the lips and mouth, but also including pedaling motions with the legs or hand movements resembling playing a piano. Some other symptoms typical during the disease onset include <b>impaired</b> <b>cognition,</b> memory deficits, and speech problems (including aphasia, perseveration or mutism).|$|E

A recent paper simulated features of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in mice, and profiled the entire transcriptome of these mice. The authors found differential regulation in many biological pathways, some of which were implicated in anxiety disorders (hyperactivity, fear response), mood disorders, and <b>impaired</b> <b>cognition.</b> These findings are backed by extensive transcriptomic analyses of anxiety disorders, and expression level changes in biological pathways involved with fear learning and memory are thought to contribute to the behavioural manifestations of these disorders. It is thought that functional enrichment of genes involved in long term synaptic potentiation, depression, and plasticity has an important role to play in the acquisition, consolidation, and maintenance of traumatic memories underlying anxiety disorders.|$|E

50|$|Difenoxin {{has a high}} peripheral/central actions ratio, working {{primarily}} on various opioid receptors in the intestines. Although {{it is capable of}} producing significant central effects at high doses, doses within the normal therapeutic range generally do not notably <b>impair</b> <b>cognition</b> or proprioception, resulting in therapeutic activity roughly equatable to that of loperamide (Imodium). Increased dosages result in more prominent central opioid effects (and anticholingeric effects when the formulation also contains a tropane alkaloid). It therefor offers limited advantages over more potent anti-diarrheal opioid options (ex. morphine) when treating intractable cases of diarrhea which fail to respond to normal or moderately increased difenoxin doses, and may in fact be harmful in such circumstances if the formulation used also contains atropine or hyoscyamine.|$|R

40|$|Due to a {{sedentary}} lifestyle, {{more and}} more people are becoming obese nowadays. In addition to health-related problems, obesity can also <b>impair</b> <b>cognition</b> and motor performance. Previous results have shown that obesity mainly affects cognition and motor behaviors through altering brain functions and musculoskeletal system, respectively. Many factors, such as insulin/leptin dysregulation and inflammation, mediate the effect of obesity and cognition and motor behaviors. Substantial evidence has suggested exercise to be an effective way to improve obesity and related cognitive and motor dysfunctions. This paper aims to discuss the association of obesity with cognition and motor behaviors and its underlying mechanisms. Following this, mechanisms of exercise to improve obesity-related dysfunctions are described. Finally, implications and future research direction are raised...|$|R
40|$|There are {{experimental}} evidences {{indicating that}} the non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine <b>impairs</b> <b>cognition</b> and produces a series of schizophrenia-like symptoms in rodents (hyperactivity, stereotypies and ataxia).

For this purpose the object recognition and the object location task were selected. Pre- or post-training systemic administration of ketamine (0. 3, 1 and 3 mg/kg; i. p.) in a dose-dependent manner disrupted animals' performance in both these recognition memory paradigms, suggesting that this compound affected pre- and post-training memory components. The current results indicate that the non-competitive NMDA antagonist ketamine may modulate either spatial or non-spatial recognition memory. (C) 2008 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
