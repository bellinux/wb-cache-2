500|$|Growing up in Houston, Texas, Beyoncé was {{surrounded}} by the Spanish language, and learned some Spanish as a child, which she later forgot. When re-recording songs for Irreemplazable, Beyoncé's vocal coach provided the Spanish lyrics phonetically, and each line was recorded up to four times for the EP. Beyoncé has stated that she intends to take up Spanish lessons in the future. She said of the EP's recording, [...] "This is such an honor {{for me to be}} able to connect with all my fans. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> fun singing in Spanish. It reminded me of growing up in Houston". The Denver Post John Wenzel interpreted the release of Irreemplazable as [...] "an effort to meet the exploding market for Spanish language music".|$|E
500|$|There {{were other}} factors at play. Balukas admits to having been under great pressure, {{much of it}} self-imposed. After she reached the {{pinnacle}} of her profession, [...] "That’s when I started getting nervous... that’s when I started {{putting a lot of}} pressure on myself." [...] "Playing against the men, I learned to lose,... but [...] hurt with the women because I was expected to win all the time." [...] Ultimately Balukas states that her break with the sport [...] "...was a buildup of everything,... A little burnout, a little frustration. It just got to a point where <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> animosity toward the pool world. And that was my out. You know, you're going to fine me? Well, see you later. That was my excuse to finally say I need a break." ...|$|E

500|$|As the Varner–Hogg {{restoration}} {{wound to}} a halt, Hogg refocused her attention on her Houston home, Bayou Bend, which housed {{some of her}} personal collection of antiques and artwork. The New York Times described her [...] "superb Early American furniture" [...] collection in 1953, {{and she had a}} large collection of Americana and colonial Mexican decorative arts, some of which are still in the house. In the late 1950s she said: [...] "I had been collecting American furniture. I collected, and collected, and collected, until <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of it I didn't {{know what to do with}} it. I decided to give it to a museum." [...] She collaborated with the original architect John Staub on structural changes that would prepare the home to be a museum. She denuded the home of personal items and items that did not meet her concept; the only piece of non-American furniture in the home was her English dining table, which had too many memories for her to remove it.|$|E
500|$|Priyanka Chopra was Bhardwaj's {{original}} {{choice for}} the role of Susanna after he worked with the actress in Kaminey: He said that Chopra [...] "is the finest actor of her generation right now... As a director <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> trust on her that I felt that no one else can essay this role as brilliantly as she would do". Mohanlal was cast as one of Susanna's husbands in the film; however, he left the project to concentrate on Malayalam films. The actor was replaced by Annu Kapoor in the role of Inspector Keemat Lal. Other actors in the film were John Abraham, Naseeruddin Shah, Neil Nitin Mukesh and Vivaan Shah. Directors Karan Johar and Imtiaz Ali were approached to play two of the seven husbands, but they reportedly turned down the offer. Usha Uthup was cast as Susanna's maid in the film. Konkona Sen Sharma was confirmed for a cameo appearance.|$|E
500|$|After Tuesday Night Music Club, Crow {{wanted to}} prove her {{authority}} as a musician. According to her, [...] "My only objective on this record was to get under people's skin, because I was feeling like <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> shit to hurl at the tape." [...] Work on the new album began at Toad Hall in Pasadena, California, the same studio where Tuesday Night Music Club was recorded, but sessions were soon relocated to New Orleans, Louisiana because Crow [...] "was feeling ghosts in that room". Bottrell was designated to produce the record and co-wrote three songs that would appear on the album, but eventually left {{because he could not}} sort out his differences with Crow. As a result, Crow took over production duties and wrote most of the songs alone or with only one collaborator. She also played most of the instruments on the album, including bass and guitar work and nearly all the keyboard parts. Most of the album was recorded at Kingsway Studio in New Orleans, although Crow would later return to Los Angeles to complete work at The Sound Factory and Sunset Sound. Audio mastering took place at Gateway Mastering Studios in Portland, Maine.|$|E

2500|$|In December 2012, {{during his}} {{interview}} with Rap-Up, T.I. stated he recorded over 120 songs and had to narrow it down to 16 that would make Trouble Man: Heavy Is the Head. T.I. claimed that he's going to take unused material from Heavy is the Head and arrange it into a new album titled Trouble Man: He Who Wears the Crown: [...] "Well, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> music man. I recorded like 120-something songs for this project, and I imagined that, you know, if just giving the amount of music that we had left over that we weren't able to put on this project, that we’d do a sequel. So, you know, the sequel to this album will be He Who Wears the Crown. That’s {{the primary reason for}} the subtitle. That's the purpose of the sequel, so we’ll have a platform to display and release these songs." ...|$|E
2500|$|The video {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics, observing the chemistry between Spears and Azalea {{as well as}} praising Spears's dancing and noting a nod to her earlier music videos. Mike Wass for Idolator wrote, [...] "Yes, it lifts product placement to previously unimagined heights and I can’t see an Academy Award in either diva’s future — but it’s {{a hell of a}} lot of fun. And just kooky enough to become a cult classic like the movie it’s loosely based on". Josh Duboff from Vanity Fair described the video as [...] "entertaining and kind of weird. There’s a lot of big hair; Spears does some endearing waving (and generally seems to be having a good time)". He concluded, [...] "Our favorite part is actually probably the tag at the end, where Spears and Azalea are just goofing around in the car; you can imagine Spears turning to Azalea afterwards and squealing, [...] "That was really cool, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> fun," [...] and meaning it". Kirthana Ramisetti for New York Daily News similarly noted, [...] "The two music stars seemed to have a lot of fun filming their video".|$|E
