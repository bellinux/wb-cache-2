The breadfruit tastes like Yorkshire pudding or mashed potato; with meat it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> vegetables; with sugar, milk, butter or molasses, it is a delicious pudding {{with a special}} flavour; Radau hopes that perhaps it {{will one day be}} found in European markets. As for the sago palm, one tree yields 1,800 cakes, enough to feed a man for a year.|$|E
5|$|The Irenaean theodicy is a Christian theodicy {{designed}} {{to respond to}} the problem of evil. As such, it defends the probability of an omnipotent and omnibenevolent (all-powerful and perfectly loving) God in the face of evidence of evil in the world. Numerous variations of theodicy have been proposed which all maintain that, while evil exists, God is either not responsible for creating evil, or he is not guilty for creating evil. Typically, the Irenaean theodicy asserts that the world <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> all possible worlds because it allows humans to fully develop. Most versions of the Irenaean theodicy propose that creation is incomplete, as humans are not yet fully developed, and experiencing evil and suffering is necessary for such development.|$|E

25|$|Skíðblaðnir (Old Norse 'assembled from thin {{pieces of}} wood'), {{sometimes}} anglicized as Skidbladnir or Skithblathnir, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> ships in Norse mythology. It is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, {{and in the}} Prose Edda and Heimskringla, both written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. All sources note that the ship is the finest of ships, and the Poetic Edda and Prose Edda attest that it {{is owned by the}} god Freyr, while the euhemerized account in Heimskringla attributes it to the magic of Odin. Both Heimskringla and the Prose Edda attribute to it the ability to be folded up—as cloth may be—into one's pocket when not needed.|$|E
25|$|Aggañña Sutta is the 27th Sutta of the Digha Nikaya collection. The sutta {{describes}} a discourse imparted by the Buddha to two brahmins, Bharadvaja and Vasettha, who left {{their family and}} caste to become monks. The two brahmins are insulted and maligned by their own caste for their intention to become members of the Sangha. The Buddha explains that caste and lineage cannot {{be compared to the}} achievement of morality practice and the Dhamma, as anyone from the four castes can become a monk and reach the state of Arahant. Then, he explains about the beginning of the Earth and the birth of social order and its structure, including the castes. The Buddha emphasizes the message of universality in the Dhamma and how the Dhamma <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> all things.|$|E

Travel a few miles on, the Earl of Chester disappears, and the King surprises you again as Count Palatine of Lancaster. If you travel beyond Mount Edgecombe, you find him once more in his incognito, and he is Duke of Cornwall... every one of those Principalities has the apparatus of a Kingdom for the jurisdiction over a few private estates, and the formality and charge of the Exchequer of Great Britain for collecting the rents of a country squire.

25|$|The boat {{is first}} {{directly}} addressed in chapter 43; there Gangleri asks that, if Skíðblaðnir <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> ships, {{what there is}} to know about it, and asks if there is no other ship as good or as large as it. High responds that while Skíðblaðnir is the finest ship and the most ingeniously created, the biggest ship is in fact Naglfar, which is owned by Muspell. The Sons of Ivaldi, who High adds are dwarfs, crafted the ship and gave it to Freyr. High continues that the ship is big enough for all of the gods to travel aboard it with wargear and weapons in tow, and that, as soon as its sail is hoisted, the ship finds good wind, and goes wherever it need be. It is made up of so many parts and with such craftsmanship that, when it is not needed at sea, it may be folded up like cloth and placed into one's pocket. Gangleri comments that Skíðblaðnir sounds like a great ship, and that it must have taken a lot of magic to create something like it.|$|E

In Grímnismál, Grimnir (Odin in disguise and not yet having revealed his identity) tells the boy Agnar in verse that Sleipnir <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> horses ("Odin <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> the Æsir, Sleipnir of horses"). In Sigrdrífumál, the valkyrie Sigrdrífa tells the hero Sigurðr that runes should be cut [...] "on Sleipnir's teeth and on the sledge's strap-bands." [...] In Baldrs draumar, after the Æsir convene about the god Baldr's bad dreams, Odin places a saddle on Sleipnir and the two ride {{to the location of}} Hel. The Völuspá hin skamma section of Hyndluljóð says that Loki produced [...] "the wolf" [...] with Angrboða, produced Sleipnir with Svaðilfari, and thirdly [...] "one monster that was thought the most baleful, who was descended from Býleistr's brother." ...|$|E

500|$|Interestingly, this {{critique}} of Voltaire's {{seems to be}} directed almost exclusively at Leibnizian optimism. Candide does not ridicule Voltaire's contemporary Alexander Pope, a later optimist of slightly different convictions. Candide does not discuss Pope's optimistic principle that [...] "all is right", but Leibniz's that states, [...] "this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> all possible worlds". However subtle {{the difference between the}} two, Candide is unambiguous as to which is its subject. Some critics conjecture that Voltaire meant to spare Pope this ridicule out of respect, although Voltaire's Poème may have been written as a more direct response to Pope's theories. This work is similar to Candide in subject matter, but very different from it in style: the Poème embodies a more serious philosophical argument than Candide.|$|E

[...] To me, who was justly entitled to the Republican nomination for the presidency, and who had to stand aside and see it given to a little Illinois lawyer!" [...] Despite his initial reservations about Lincoln's abilities, he came to admire Lincoln as the president grew more confident in his job. [...] Seward wrote to his wife in June 1861, [...] "Executive skill and vigor are rare qualities. The President <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> us, but he needs constant and assiduous cooperation." [...] According to Goodwin, [...] "Seward would become his most faithful ally in the cabinet... Seward's mortification at not having received his party's nomination never fully abated, but he no longer felt compelled to belittle Lincoln to ease his pain." [...] Lincoln, a one-term congressman, was inexperienced in Washington ways, and relied on Seward's advice on protocol and social etiquette.|$|E
500|$|The {{major works}} for voices and {{orchestra}} of the twenty-one years of Elgar's middle period are three large-scale works for soloists, chorus and orchestra: The Dream of Gerontius (1900), and the oratorios The Apostles (1903) and The Kingdom (1906); and two shorter odes, the Coronation Ode (1902) and The Music Makers (1912). The {{first of the}} odes, as a pièce d'occasion, has rarely been revived after its initial success, with the culminating [...] "Land of Hope and Glory". The second is, for Elgar, unusual in that it contains several quotations from his earlier works, as Richard Strauss quoted himself in Ein Heldenleben. The choral works were all successful, although the first, Gerontius, was and remains the best-loved and most performed. On the manuscript Elgar wrote, quoting John Ruskin, [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> me; for the rest, I ate, and drank, and slept, loved and hated, like another. My life was as the vapour, and is not; but this I saw, and knew; this, if anything of mine, is worth your memory." [...] All three of the large-scale works follow the traditional model with sections for soloists, chorus and both together. Elgar's distinctive orchestration, {{as well as his}} melodic inspiration, lifts them to a higher level than most of their British predecessors.|$|E
