5000|$|The Dreamachine (or Dream Machine) is a {{stroboscopic}} <b>flicker</b> <b>device</b> {{that produces}} visual stimuli. Artist Brion Gysin and William S. Burroughs's [...] "systems adviser" [...] Ian Sommerville created the Dreamachine after reading William Grey Walter's book, The Living Brain.|$|E
5000|$|With Sommerville, {{he built}} the Dreamachine in 1961. Described as [...] "the first art object {{to be seen}} with the eyes closed", the <b>flicker</b> <b>device</b> uses alpha waves in the 8-16 Hz range to produce a change of {{consciousness}} in receptive viewers.|$|E
5000|$|He is {{best known}} for his {{discovery}} of the cut-up technique, used by his friend, the novelist William S. Burroughs. With the engineer Ian Sommerville he invented the Dreamachine, a <b>flicker</b> <b>device</b> designed as an art object to be viewed with the eyes closed. It was in painting and drawing, however, that Gysin devoted his greatest efforts, creating calligraphic works inspired by the cursive Japanese [...] "grass" [...] script and Arabic script. Burroughs later stated that [...] "Brion Gysin was the only man I ever respected." ...|$|E

50|$|The CDR {{system is}} a {{computer}} based cognitive testing tool, developed to assess both enhancement and impairment of human cognitive performance. The CDR system's simplicity, sensitivity and specificity makes it acceptable {{to be used in}} clinical trials with either healthy subjects or diseased patient populations.

Ancillary equipment is used for specific cognitive tests such as a postural stability (sway) meter, a critical <b>flicker</b> fusion <b>device</b> or joysticks for CDR's tracking test.|$|R
50|$|A film chain usually used a {{video camera}} tube as this reduced flicker. Vidicon image pick up tubes were the {{preferred}} pick up for film chains as these gave {{the least amount of}} <b>flicker.</b> When charge-coupled <b>device</b> (CCD) cameras were introduced these were also used in a film chain. CCD cameras often gave a sharper picture, but with more flicker.|$|R
50|$|The {{frames are}} doubled (from a 25 frame source) on {{broadcast}} (to avoid <b>flicker)</b> for display <b>devices</b> that lack {{any kind of}} frame doubling ability. Widescreen 16:9 material has only the width scaled down to fit 720 pixels instead of an unscaled 1024 width. SMPTE 344M defines a 576p50 standard with twice the data rate of BT.601, using 704 × 576 active pixels with 16 x 576 horizontal blanking pixels.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{the effect}} of <b>device</b> <b>flicker</b> noise on the {{characteristics}} of both opto-electronic oscillator and Photonic-delay homodyne phase noise measurement system is analyzed. An analytic theory model of opto-electronic oscillator (OEO) is derived and verified by experiments in this paper, where the flicker and white noise are both considered. The sensitivity of Photonic-delay homodyne phase noise measurement system is improved by using high-linear photodetector and low-phase noise amplifier resulting from decreasing systematic phase noise...|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} {{analytical model}} for flicker noise (1 /f noise) in MOSFETs is presented. Current models do not capture {{the effect of}} high-trap density in the halo regions of the devices, which leads to significantly different bias dependence of <b>flicker</b> noise across <b>device</b> geometry. The proposed model is the first compact model implementation capturing such effect and show distinct improvements over other existing noise models. The model is compatible with BSIM 6, the latest industry standard model for bulk MOSFET, and is validated with measurements from 45 -nm low-power CMOS technology node. 6 page(s...|$|R
50|$|Also in December 1922, Laurens Hammond (later {{inventor}} of the Hammond organ) premiered his Teleview system, which had been shown to the trade and press in October. Teleview was the first alternating-frame 3D system seen by the public. Using left-eye and right-eye prints and two interlocked projectors, left and right frames were alternately projected, each pair being shown three times to suppress <b>flicker.</b> Viewing <b>devices</b> attached to the armrests of the theater seats had rotary shutters that operated synchronously with the projector shutters, producing a clean and clear stereoscopic result. The only theater known to have installed Teleview was the Selwyn Theater in New York City, and only one show was ever presented with it: a group of short films, an exhibition of live 3D shadows, and M.A.R.S., the only Teleview feature. The show ran for several weeks, apparently doing good business as a novelty (M.A.R.S. itself got poor reviews), but Teleview was never seen again.|$|R
40|$|Low-frequency {{noise in}} {{n-channel}} MOSFETs was studied {{over a wide}} range of temperatures and biases. The devices were subjected to nitridation by annealing in NH 3 and N 2 O which were subsequently gettered by low-energy Ar+ ranging from 10 minutes to 40 minutes. The noise spectra for devices with different gettering times are compared to the ungettered devices. It is found that, for both types of <b>devices,</b> <b>flicker</b> noise is reduced by backsurface gettering for short gettering times. The low-frequency noise arises from thermal activation of carriers to traps at the Si-SiO 2 interface. Backsurface gettering results in the modification of the energy distribution of the interface traps, probably due to stress relaxation at the Si-SiO 2 interface. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Within {{hours after}} Hurricane Sandy’s landfall, doctors and staff {{at one of}} New York City’s premier medical centers {{realized}} that something was going terribly wrong. Lights were <b>flickering,</b> critical <b>devices</b> essential to life support for more than 200 patients, many in intensive care units, were malfunctioning. A decision {{had to be made}} by hospital leaders, senior public health officials, and emergency responders: tough it out in a hospital without power or attempt a perilous patient evacuation as an epic disaster unfolded. With little time to lose, the “go” order was given, followed by frantic calls to high-ground hospitals identifying beds for receiving New York University–Langone Medical Center’s critically ill patients. St. Luke’s–Roosevelt, Mt. Sinai, New York Presbyterian at Columbia, and many other hospitals responded immediately, opening beds, readying emergency admission procedures, and briefing staff. But questions about why these extreme measures were necessary will have to be answered in the months ahead. Although the first question may be how to prevent power failure, the nuances of backup and redundant power generation are not generally within the expertise of health professionals. And in fact, the generators themselves were probably fine; the problem appears to have been that fuel pumps supplying the generators were in the basement, highly susceptible to break- down from flooding. Ways of ensuring resiliency of backup power equipment will certainly be investigated later. For now, it’s important to understand what medical and public health challenges are to be expected after mega-disasters such as Hurricane Sandy...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{results on}} metamorphic and pseudomorpic GaAs HEMT based Voltage Controlled Oscillators and a novel high-Q varactor structure, {{used in the}} VCOs, together with a straightforward extraction procedure for the varactors. Theory and fundamentals around LC-oscillators with oscillator criteria, phase noise and different topologies are given as background together with VCO phase noise measurement methods and an overview on <b>device</b> <b>flicker</b> noise; its physical origin and measurement. Furthermore, design guidelines and suggestions for successful integrated VCO design is presented using a 7 GHz mHEMT VCO as example. It is also shown that the flicker noise generation in mHEMT and pHEMT increases rapidly with drain source voltage leading to a changed optimal Vds bias in the VCO compared to if these noise sources were non existent. Finally, the conclusion is made that a mHEMT process is equally suitable for VCOs as a pHEMT process with the mHEMT version more favorable from a power consumption perspective...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the most}} basic of {{circuits}}, if the current falls below the holding current even briefly, the circuit is turned 'OFF' (becomes blocked). However, complex circuits and devices may have different delays built-in between the time the current falls below this level and the time the device turns 'OFF'. Whether a device turns 'ON' when current is restored is a design issue. The current necessary to restore the circuit to the 'ON' state, called the [...] "threshold current" [...] (See threshold voltage), may be much greater than the holding current, or only very slightly more. Nevertheless, where the device is designed to turn back 'ON' upon restoration of the current and where the device is running at or about the holding current level, slight variations in the current can cause <b>flicker</b> as the <b>device</b> cycles 'OFF' and 'ON'. If flicker is undesirable, it can be reduced by the use of capacitors or other circuits, on the other hand, flicker can be used to measure small events as in a Geiger-Müller tube.|$|R
40|$|The {{quality of}} {{electric}} power is of supreme importance to electrical utilities and their customers. Modern equipments {{are more sensitive}} to power system anomalies than in the past. Microprocessor based controls and power electronics devices are sensitive to many types of disturbances. Minor power disruptions, which once would have been noticed only as a momentary flickering of the lights, may now completely interrupt whole automated factories because of sensitive electronic controllers or make all the computer screens at an office go blank at once. In order to restart the whole production, computers, etc, a considerable time might be necessary, implying on significant financial losses to an industry. Hence voltage flicker caused by loads that exhibit continuous, rapid variations in load current is considered as a major power quality issue. In order to quantify the scale of flickering phenomenon, {{research has been conducted}} with the aims of developing measurement equipment, containment techniques and methods of mitigation. Accurate tracking and estimation of the voltage flicker levels are important for effective design and implementations of voltage <b>flicker</b> mitigation <b>devices.</b> Voltage <b>flicker</b> estimation incorporates measurement of flicker severity indicative parameters and estimation of voltage envelope, flicker frequency and phase angle of flickering voltage. This paper analyses measurement of flicker indicative parameters called short term flicker severity (PST) and long term flicker severity (PLT), estimation of envelope and phase angle of flickering voltage using ANN, application of the adaptive linear neuron (ADALINE) for determining total flicker distortion (TFD) which models the flicker voltage as a linear combination of orthogonal sinusoids with on-line frequency correction scheme for taking into account small-frequency variations of the base voltage waveform and estimation of the percentage relative voltage change of the voltage flicker which is modeled as an amplitude-modulated signal, and the voltage flicker, which is the modulating signal, is a sinusoid of random frequency and random magnitud...|$|R
40|$|Voltage flicker is a {{power quality}} problem caused by {{regularly}} oscillating active and reactive power either from a load or generator. The regular power oscillations induce a voltage change at the grid connection which {{is proportional to the}} amplitude of the power oscillation and at the same frequency. The impedance of the grid (grid strength) at the point of connection is a factor in the amplitude of the voltage oscillation. The frequency band of interest for flicker evaluation is from 0. 01 - 20 Hz, and is most severe at 8. 8 Hz. The frequency of the primary resource for wave energy converters lies within this range. Therefore the coupling of the input resource to the output power of a wave energy converter will cause voltage flicker at the point of connection. This is particularly true for ‘direct drive’ wave energy converters. This paper serves to establish the flicker effects of wave energy converters on the grid voltage. The paper outlines some working guidelines for the evaluation of <b>flicker</b> from a <b>device.</b> The paper concludes that wave energy converters may exceed flicker emission limits, particularly in weak grid areas and suggests some strategies for overcoming this problem...|$|R
40|$|For {{wave energy}} converters, the input {{resource}} has a typical period of 5 – 20 s {{depending on the}} site location and dominant seastates. Wave energy converters generally produce mechanical power twice per wave cycle and therefore depending on the storage available, the electrical power output has half {{the period of the}} input resource. These regular power changes induce a voltage change at the point of connection (POC) which is proportional to the amplitude of the power change and at the same frequency. Therefore the coupling of the input resource to the output power of a wave energy converter will cause voltage flicker at the POC, which may exceed the permitted limits under specific conditions. This study establishes the nature of the flicker issue from wave energy converters. Some practical tools for the evaluation of <b>flicker</b> from a <b>device</b> are introduced. These tools are suitable for early stage flicker assessment to assist in the design process only. They are not meant of substitutes for existing codes and standards which are outlined in this study. This study concludes that wave energy converters may exceed flicker emission limits {{as a result of the}} coupling of the resource to the output power, and this may be particularly severe when connected to weak grids. Some potential strategies for overcoming this problem are presented also...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurposeThis study {{evaluated}} the summed measures of macular pigment optical density (MPOD) spatial distribution {{and their effects}} on intraocular scatter using a commercially available device (C-Quant, Oculus, USA). MethodsA customized heterochromatic <b>flicker</b> photometer (cHFP) <b>device</b> {{was used to measure}} MPOD spatial distribution across the central 16 ° using a 1 ° stimulus. MPOD was calculated as a discrete measure and summed measures across the central 1 °, 3. 3 °, 10 ° and 16 ° diameters. Intraocular scatter was determined as a mean of 5 trials in which reliability and repeatability measures were met using the C-Quant. MPOD spatial distribution maps were constructed and the effects of both discrete and summed values on intraocular scatter were examined. ResultsSpatial mapping identified mean values for discrete MPOD [0. 32 (s. d. = 0. 08) ], MPOD summed across central 1 ° [0. 37 (s. d. = 0. 11) ], MPOD summed across central 3. 3 ° [0. 85 (s. d. = 0. 20) ], MPOD summed across central 10 ° [1. 60 (s. d. = 0. 35) ] and MPOD summed across central 16 ° [1. 78 (s. d. = 0. 39) ]. Mean intraocular scatter was 0. 83 (s. d. = 0. 16) log units. While there were consistent trends for an inverse relationship between MPOD and scatter, these relationships were not statistically significant. Correlations between the highest and lowest quartiles of MPOD within the central 1 ° were near significance. ConclusionsWhile there was an overall trend of decreased intraocular forward scatter with increased MPOD consistent with selective short wavelength visible light attenuation, neither discrete nor summed values of MPOD significantly influence intraocular scatter as measured by the C-Quant device...|$|R
40|$|SeaGen is a 1. 2 MW {{tidal energy}} {{converter}} (TEC) under development by Marine Current Turbines (MCT) Ltd. It {{has been in}} regular production since May 2009 and is the world's largest grid-connected TEC which has produced over 3, 000 MWhr to date. A research project was undertaken by ESB International, Chalmers University and MCT to measure, analyse and characterise the power quality performance of the SeaGen device with a particular emphasis on developing {{an understanding of the}} levels of flicker emissions during operations and the determination of the <b>device's</b> <b>flicker</b> co-efficients. As no standard exists for this work, the existing standard used for wind turbine power quality performance assessment was adapted and the deviations from it are outlined in the paper and the justifications for the different approaches used. This paper presents a summary of many of the results of this research project but has a particular emphasis on a comparative analysis of the SeaGen PQ performance against comparably sized wind turbines. The technical paper also outlines the characteristic features of the TEC itself and its power take-off system, followed by the electrical and marine environments of its location. The research work found that the power quality performance of the TEC was generally good and the results are conservative as a much larger array of devices connected to the transmission grid would be expected to have significantly better power quality performance due to diversification and cancellation between them. The flicker co-efficients were determined mainly following the procedure in IEC 61400 - 21 (adapted as outlined) and were found to be comparable to wind turbines with very good power quality performance. The harmonic performance of the device (both voltage and current) was also very good...|$|R
