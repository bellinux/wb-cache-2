500|$|Despite the {{favorable}} reviews and good chart {{position of the}} lead single, 1000 Fires did not achieve mainstream success. Lords later commented: [...] "The problem with that album {{was that it was}} ahead of its time. Electronica was just starting to happen. Moby was just starting to be huge. I opened for Thrill Kill Kult and Moby as a DJ back then. The masses didn't know who Moby was. I think if it had been slightly delayed it would have done better. Madonna had it right to wait for Ray of Light. She has been a lot better with her timing than me. I am proud of that album because <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> now and it still feels current. It doesn't feel dated." ...|$|E
500|$|SpongeBob's voice {{evolved from}} [...] "low-key" [...] to high-pitched. Kenny said, [...] "I hear the change. <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it.</b> It's mostly a {{question}} of pitch." [...] He said that [...] "It's unconscious on my part" [...] because [...] "I don't wake up and think, 'Hmm, I'm going to change SpongeBob's voice today, just {{for the hell of}} it." [...] He described it that [...] "It's like erosion: a very slow process. As time goes on, you need to bring him to different places and more places, the more stories and scripts you do." [...] Contrasting first-season episodes to those of the seventh season, Kenny said that [...] "there's a bit of a change , but I don't think it's that extreme at all." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Sometimes when I'm {{writing a}} song, {{it does come}} from such a raw place that I'm {{actually}} crying while writing it," [...] Mariah admitted. Her second single, a tribute to her late father, is also meant to reach anyone else who has suffered a loss of a loved one. [...] "Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> and {{feel that this is}} going to touch a lot of people, and that's why it's important that no matter what's ever happened to me over my career, that I stay the course and continue to write and try and reach people who need." [...] Anyone who manages to do the reverse, and touch Mariah with one of their songs, [...] "I'm indebted to them forever." ...|$|E

500|$|Robert Smith said he {{considers}} [...] "Just Like Heaven" [...] {{to be one}} of the band's strongest works, and called it [...] "the best pop song the Cure have ever done". Several high-profile fans have expressed their appreciation of the song. Musician Ben Folds told Blender [...] "everything about it—the songwriting, the music—is state of the art. It’s as good as it gets. Anytime <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> on the radio or a mix tape, I jump around like a freak." [...] J Mascis said his band Dinosaur Jr.'s affection for the song inspired them to record a cover version that was released in 1989. On 16 July 2006, [...] "Just Like Heaven" [...] was played as a wake-up call for the crew of Space Shuttle Discovery on their flight STS-121 at the request of astronaut Piers Sellers' family; Sellers told mission control center that the song reminded him of [...] "the wild, happy, beer-drinking years of my youth." ...|$|E
500|$|At 8:30, Goodman {{issued a}} {{statement}} apologizing for the incident, and stating that he had missed {{the ending of the}} game [...] "as much as anybody". He stated that it was [...] "a forgivable error committed by humans who were concerned about children expecting to see Heidi". The following morning, Cline was called into a meeting with his bosses. He was told that if he had done anything other than what he did, NBC would have been at the mercy of Timex and Cline would have been fired. The network turned the fiasco into an advantage by subsequent self-mockery, promoting the following week's Jets game telecast with an advertisement showing Namath with Heidi on his shoulders, and running another ad with testimonials about Heidi, the last: [...] "I didn't {{get a chance to see}} it, but <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> was great", signed by Namath. Other networks joined in: on the CBS Evening News the following Monday night (November 18), Harry Reasoner announced the [...] "result" [...] of the game: [...] "Heidi married the goat-herder". That same evening, NBC's own Huntley-Brinkley Report aired the tape of the game's final minute, complete with the re-created Gowdy/DeRogatis commentary. On the ABC Evening News, anchor Frank Reynolds read excerpts from Heidi while clips of the Raiders' two touchdowns were shown as cut-ins.|$|E
2500|$|McCartney {{has called}} it his {{favorite}} song of all time. In {{an interview with}} David Leaf in 1990 he stated, [...] "I was asked recently to give my top 10 favorite songs for a Japanese radio station ... I didn't think long and hard on it but I popped that [...] {{on the top of}} my list. It's very deep. Very emotional, always a bit of a choker for me, that one." [...] Speaking again in 2007, McCartney said: [...] "'God Only Knows' {{is one of the few}} songs that reduces me to tears every time <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it.</b> It's really just a love song, but it's brilliantly done. It shows the genius of Brian. I've actually performed it with him and I'm afraid to say that during the sound check I broke down. It was just too much to stand there singing this song that does my head in and to stand there singing it with Brian." [...] Brian responded apprehensively to McCartney's admiration of the song in the 1970s: [...] "Like, if 'God Only Knows' is the greatest song ever written, then I'll never write anything as good again! And if I never write anything as good, then I'm finished." ...|$|E
