5|$|Although {{generally}} {{quiet and}} non-vocal, giraffes {{have been heard}} to communicate using various sounds. During courtship, males emit loud coughs. Females call their young by bellowing. Calves will emit snorts, bleats, mooing and mewing sounds. Giraffes also snore, hiss, moan, grunt and make flute-like sounds, and possibly communicate over long distances using infrasound—though this is disputed. During nighttime, giraffes appear to hum to each other above the <b>infrasound</b> range for purposes which are unclear.|$|E
5|$|The human ear can {{generally}} hear sounds with frequencies between 20 Hz and 20 kHz (the audio range). Sounds {{outside this}} range are considered <b>infrasound</b> (below 20Hz) or ultrasound (above 20kHz) Although hearing requires an intact and functioning auditory {{portion of the}} central nervous system as well as a working ear, human deafness (extreme insensitivity to sound) most commonly occurs because of abnormalities of the inner ear, rather than in the nerves or tracts of the central auditory system.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} are apex {{predators and}} consume fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Hatchlings feed mostly on invertebrates. They {{play an important}} role as ecosystem engineers in wetland ecosystems through the creation of alligator holes, which provide both wet and dry habitats for other organisms. Throughout the year, but particularly during the breeding season, American alligators bellow to declare territory and locate suitable mates. Male American alligators use <b>infrasound</b> to attract females. Eggs are laid in a nest of vegetation, sticks, leaves, and mud in a sheltered spot in or near the water. Young are born with yellow bands around their bodies and are protected by their mother for up to one year.|$|E

40|$|Archaeoacoustics {{provides}} a way of offering new interpretations on anthropological questions pertaining to ancient architecture and populations. We made an archaeoacoustic analysis of a medieval castle (Gropparello) in Italy built over a likely ancient sacred site known from Celtic period of that area. Our results show {{a great number of}} physical phenomena that appear to exist only within the area of the castle but they are not detectable in the surrounding neighborhood. In particular we found <b>infrasounds,</b> audible low frequencies and spiral magnetic fields able to affect brain activity. We can presume that the myth of a sacred site pre-existing in the location where the castle was built is real. The site seems to have the same characteristics we found in other sacred sites in Europe and Asia...|$|R
50|$|Mating {{happens when}} the female becomes receptive, an event that can occur anytime during the year. When she is ready, she starts {{emitting}} <b>infrasounds</b> to attract the males, sometimes from kilometers away. The adult males start arriving at the herd during the following days and begin fighting, causing some injuries and even broken tusks. The female shows her acceptance of the victor by rubbing her body against his. They mate, and then both go their own way. After 22 months of gestation (the longest among mammals), the female gives birth to a single 90-cm-high calf which weighs more than 100 kg. The baby feeds on the mother's milk {{until the age of}} five, but also eats solid food from as early as six months old. Just a few days after birth, the calf can follow the herd by foot.|$|R
5|$|Elephants have a fission–fusion {{society in}} which {{multiple}} family groups come together to socialise. Males ("bulls") leave their family groups when they reach puberty and may live alone or with other males. Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate and enter a state of increased testosterone and aggression known as musth, which helps them gain dominance and reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers {{for as long as}} three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight, smell, and sound; elephants use <b>infrasound,</b> and seismic communication over long distances. Elephant intelligence has been compared with that of primates and cetaceans. They appear to have self-awareness and show empathy for dying or dead individuals of their kind.|$|E
5|$|Because no seismographs {{were close}} enough to the Nazko swarm zone before the {{earthquakes}} began, employees of Natural Resources Canada placed seismographs in the area to monitor future earthquakes in the area more clearly. An <b>infrasound</b> station is also being established, which is able to measure sound waves that would normally go unnoticed by human hearing. These stations can detect volcanic eruptions and the release of gas at volcanic vents, and can be used in combination with other geophysical data to monitor fluid flow within volcanoes. Employees of Natural Resources Canada have also visited two communities that were adjacent to the 2007–2008 earthquake swarm to renew information about the Nazko swarm, collect samples, and examine some of the more poorly studied volcanic deposits in the Nazko region. The Natural Resources Canada employees also measured carbon dioxide levels during the earthquake swarm. Carbon dioxide is usually discharged at faults in volcanically active areas and can collect in soil and under snow. Because of this, carbon dioxide concentrations can provide information on volcanic activity in the subsurface. The Nazko swarm did not cause any discernible discharge of carbon dioxide, which is normal for non-eruptive events.|$|E
5|$|Some mammals {{have a large}} larynx {{and thus}} a {{low-pitched}} voice, namely the hammer-headed bat (Hypsignathus monstrosus) where the larynx can take up {{the entirety of the}} thoracic cavity while pushing the lungs, heart, and trachea into the abdomen. Large vocal pads can also lower the pitch, as in the low-pitched roars of big cats. The production of <b>infrasound</b> is possible in some mammals such as the African elephant (Loxodonta spp.) and baleen whales. Small mammals with small larynxes have the ability to produced ultrasound, which can be detected by modifications to the middle ear and cochlea. Ultrasound is inaudible to birds and reptiles, which might have been important during the Mesozoic, when birds and reptiles were the dominant predators. This private channel is used by some rodents in, for example, mother-to-pup communication, and by bats when echolocating. Toothed whales also use echolocation, but, as opposed to the vocal membrane that extends upward from the vocal folds, they have a melon to manipulate sounds. Some mammals, namely the primates, have air sacs attached to the larynx, which may function to increase the volume of sound.|$|E
40|$|Over the years, SB {{research}} group has carried out investigations at two Romans archaeological sites with thermal baths; in Serbia in 2013 {{and more recently}} the Laško area in Slovenia. In both cases we found the positioning of the Roman baths is {{to be much more}} than a purely random act, because in both sites all the equipment used detected deep <b>infrasounds</b> from underground. It is conceivable that when the human body is immersed in the thermal water, it is invested integrally by certain vibrations which {{have an effect on the}} physical body generating a sense of wellbeing. It is also believed that empirical knowledge of thermal waters (originating from the Etruscans) was utilized by the soothsayers of the Roman Empire, the augurs, to locate the baths to obtain the maximum benefit from natural wellbeing properties.

40|$|Archaeoacoustics {{offers a}} new way to {{interpret}} anthropological questions pertaining to ancient architecture and populations. Studies conducted at a number of ancient sites throughout Europe and Asia, have found the presence of natural phenomena capable of influencing the human brain. Earlier studies show that ancient populations most likely through use of empirical methods chose the location of their ceremonial sites for this reason. In Xaghra Hypogeum a stone circle located on the island of Gozo, Malta, <b>infrasounds</b> and audible low frequencies capable of affecting the brain were discovered. The caves and surrounding stones act like a musical box amplifying the natural sounds present and it is possible the natural caves could have been modified to enhance this aspect. Similar natural characteristics were also discovered at other archaeological sites in Europe and Asia, including Epidauros in Greece and Gobekli Tepe in Turkey.

25|$|In 2006 {{research}} {{about the impact}} of sound emissions from wind turbines on nearby population, perceived <b>infrasound</b> has been associated to effects such as annoyance or fatigue, depending on its intensity, with little evidence supporting physiological effects of <b>infrasound</b> below the human perception threshold. Later studies, however, have linked inaudible <b>infrasound</b> to effects such as fullness, pressure or tinnitus, and acknowledged the possibility that it could disturb sleep. Other studies have also suggested associations between noise levels in turbines and self-reported sleep disturbances in the nearby population, while adding that the contribution of <b>infrasound</b> to this effect is still not fully understood.|$|E

25|$|The {{microphone}} design {{differs from}} that of a conventional audio system in that the peculiar features of <b>infrasound</b> are taken into account. First, <b>infrasound</b> propagates over vast distances through the Earth's atmosphere as a result of very low atmospheric absorption and of refractive ducting that enables propagation by way of multiple bounces between the Earth's surface and the stratosphere. A second property that has received little attention is the great penetration capability of <b>infrasound</b> through solid matter – a property utilized in the design and fabrication of the system windscreens.|$|E
40|$|Some hazards {{posed by}} the {{operation}} of hydraulic systems, connected with low-frequency vibrations and noise are presented. Special {{attention is focused on}} <b>infrasounds.</b> The sources of low-frequency vibrations and noise and the ways of reducing them are indicated. More over, this paper deals with the effects of external mechanical vibrations on hydraulic valves. An original solution ensuring the effective reduction of vibrations and noise in a wide frequency range, i. e. a wide-band damper of pressure fluctuations, also performing the function of an acoustic filter, is proposed. The results of preliminary experimental tests of simple vibration insulators are reported. The effectiveness of the damper has been confirmed by the results of laboratory tests and tests carried out on engineering machines working in real conditions. Problems relating to the noise emitted into the environment by machines equipped with hydraulic systems are covered by Polish and EU standards and directives, e. g.

40|$|Ultra-low {{frequency}} acoustic waves called "acoustic gravity waves" or "infrasounds" are theoretically {{expected to}} resonate between {{the ground and}} the thermosphere. This resonance is a very important phenomenon causing the coupling of the solid Earth, neutral atmosphere, and ionospheric plasma. This acoustic resonance, however, has not been confirmed by direct observations. In this study, atmospheric perturbations on the ground and ionospheric disturbances were observed and compared with each other to confirm the existence of resonance. Atmospheric perturbations were observed with a barometer, and ionospheric disturbances were observed using the HF Doppler method. An end point of resonance is in the ionosphere, where conductivity is high and the dynamo effect occurs. Thus, geomagnetic observation is also useful, so the geomagnetic data were compared with other data. Power spectral density was calculated and averaged for each month. Peaks appeared at the theoretically expected resonance frequencies in the pressure and HF Doppler data. The frequencies of the peaks varied with the seasons. This is probably because the vertical temperature profile of the atmosphere varies with the seasons, as does the reflection height of <b>infrasounds.</b> These results indicate that acoustic resonance occurs frequently...|$|R
40|$|An unpredictably strong {{geomagnetic}} storm {{took place on}} April 6 - 7 2000. A scientific study on aurora related sounds and acoustical effects had just been started. There were two possible choices: to perform audio recordings with a non-professional ad hoc setup, or, to miss a promising possibility to study the phenomena. The first choice was selected and it produced over seventy-five minutes of data, corrupted with impulsive noise from a DC/AC-inverter used to power recording equipment in the field. The data consists of ten successive recordings. This paper describes a novel method to cancel the impulses found in data without affecting the microphone signal significantly. Next, {{the power of the}} cleaned signal is computed in 1 / 3 -octave bands. The spectral comparisons of the different recordings showed a clear increase in the average power in recording # 5 that was sampled somewhat after the peak of geomagnetic activity. Specifically, the frequency band around 100 Hz showed an increase in power and also in its fluctuation during the most active geomagnetic periods. This new result supports those obtained earlier [4]. Also, the role of related <b>infrasounds</b> is preliminary discussed. 1...|$|R

A network of 60 <b>infrasound</b> stations, in addition to seismic and hydroacoustic stations, comprise the International Monitoring System (IMS) that is tasked with monitoring compliance with the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). IMS <b>Infrasound</b> stations consist of eight microbarometer sensors and space filters arranged in an array covering an area of approximately 1 to 9km^2. The space filters used are radiating pipes with inlet ports along their length, designed to average out pressure variations like wind turbulence for more precise measurements. The microbarometers used are designed to monitor frequencies below approximately 20 hertz. Sound waves below 20 hertz have longer wavelengths and are not easily absorbed, allowing for detection across large distances.|$|E

Nonetheless, a 2009 expert panel review concluded that wind turbines do not directly make people ill.

The Maïdo observatory takes over from its predecessor programs at sea level over the island who started long-term observation data of atmospheric chemical composition since 1994. the Maïdo observatory is an ideal platform to sample the atmosphere with different techniques (in-situ analysers, radiosounding, passive and active remote sensing) and to record surface measurements and vertical profiles from ground to the mesosphere over a subtropical latitude band poorly sampled by other international programs. The Maïdo observatory hosts lidars, one UV spectrometer, one radiosonding station, Ftir spectrometers, microwave radiometers, one lightning antenna, cameras, one Gnss station, microbarometers, etc. these devices sample many atmospheric parameters (e. g., meteorological parameters, reactive and greenhouse gases, aerosols, lightning and transient luminous events, <b>infrasounds,</b> etc). part of this very extensive range of instruments is approved and belongs to international networks like nDaCC (network for the Detection of atmospheric Composition Change), sHaDOZ (southern Hemisphere aDditional OZonesondes), tCCOn (total Carbon Column Observing network), and WWLLN (World Wide Lightning Location Network). in-situ analysers regroup measurements of reactive and greenhouse gases, and aerosols measurements approved by or applying to networks like GAW/WMO (Global Atmospheric Watching / World Meteorological Organization), iCOs (integrated Carbon Observing system). The Maïdo observatory is currently the only way to provide regular remote and in-situ atmospheric observations at subtropical latitudes and at high resolutions (seconds in time, few tenths of meters vertically) over a marine-remote region poorly sampled by other programs. it provides data for users in science and policy including air quality forecasting, verification of CO 2 emissions and Kyoto monitoring, numerical weather prediction, and validation of global chemical transport model, global climate chemical model and satellite products. since its participation in on-going european projects (nOrs, aCtris- 2, arise- 2), and thanks to the start of delivery of data in near real time, the Maïdo observatory will largely contribute to the Copernicus atmosphere Monitoring services (CaMs). the Maïdo observatory is open to transnational access thanks to its participation in european programmes like aCtris- 2 and enVriplus. this presentation will give an overview of results achieved so far and a number of highlights to illustrate the promise Maïdo observatory data hold for the future, allowing new applications and analysis for a broad community of users...|$|R
