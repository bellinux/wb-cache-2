40|$|AbstractRepresentation of Romania at the <b>European</b> <b>Council's</b> {{meetings}} {{has been}} a controversial issue, a subject of reflection for the Constitutional Court which pronounced three decisions on this matter, each of them expressing distinct opinions. Romania's representation at the <b>European</b> <b>Council's</b> meetings has become a topic of great interest {{with the onset of}} a constitutional legal conflict between the President and the Prime Minister. This conflict occurred in the summer of 2012, when it raised the issue of who would represent Romania at the <b>European</b> <b>Council's</b> meeting on June 28 - 29 th of the same year. The Constitutional Court has pronounced two decisions on the matter - Decision no. 683 / 2012 and Decision no. 784 / 2012 -, which provide “in the exercise of his attributions, The President of Romania participates at the <b>European</b> <b>Council's</b> meetings as head of state. This attribution may be delegated by the President of Romania, expressly, to the Prime Minister. In this context, the Constitutional Court was notified by the head of state with an objection of unconstitutionality of certain provisions of the Law on the Cooperation between Parliament and Government in European affairs. So, the Constitutional Court pronounced the third decision whereby it changed some aspects of its own jurisprudence on the matter. This study reveals and comments on the three decisions of the Constitutional Court and presents the opinions expressed by the doctrine on the subject under analysis. Finally, mainly for reasons of efficiency, we make some arguments in favour of the participation of the Prime Minister at <b>European</b> <b>Council's</b> meetings...|$|R

5|$|The Treaty of Lisbon {{made the}} <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> a formal {{institution}} {{distinct from the}} (ordinary) Council of the EU, and created the present longer term and full-time presidency. As {{an outgrowth of the}} Council of the EU, the <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> had previously followed the same Presidency, rotating between each member state. While the Council of the EU retains that system, the <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> established, with no change in powers, a system of appointing an individual (without them being a national leader) for a two-and-a-half-year term - which can be renewed for the same person only once. Following the ratification of the treaty in December 2009, the <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> elected the then-Prime Minister of Belgium Herman Van Rompuy as its first permanent president (resigning from Belgian Prime Minister).|$|E
