40|$|Since the 1980 s a {{new wave}} of {{globalization}} has caused dramatic increase in foreign investments in less developed countries (LDC), restructuring their international trade relations. In this context, social scientists have asked about the effects of international economic relationships on social and economic development in LDCs. Most of the previous research on this question focused on national levels of foreign direct investment (FDI), or the (national) level of concentration of FDI, or trade dependence. Researchers in the dependency theory tradition argued that poor countries with a highly concentrated FDI generate a pattern of dependency. High investment concentration by a single or a small number of investing countries limits the autonomy of state and business elites to act in the long term interest of domestic growth in the host country. Similarly, dependency theorists have found that dominance of foreign capital allowed the investing country to obtain and maintain a significant advantage over its dependent partner. Other subset of studies in that tradition focuses on the relationship between economic dependence and food security. One recent study argues that the effects of FDI on food security depend on how FDI is distributed among economic sectors (primary manufacturing, service). The existing research on this topic has not, however, given enough attention to the physical presence of multinational corporations (MNCs) as a distinct form of <b>international</b> <b>economic</b> <b>relationship.</b> If we turn our attention to the physical presence of MNC facilities, then we have these new questions concerning local-level effects of the presence of foreign capital in LDCs. My research takes up questions regarding the relationship between the physical presences of multi-national corporations (MNCs) in Africa and local level effects on development policies and human capital, with a local level analysis. I will be using local level data from African countries found in the sources cited below. I will be looking at the presence of MNCs in 10 African countries and selecting three to five districts from each country where there are MNCs located and then picking comparison three to five districts that are from each country that do not have MNCs. This research should gives us a clear understanding about the effects and outcomes on the physical presence of MNCs in LDCs at the local level...|$|E

40|$|There {{appears to}} have been an attempt by the EEC Commission 'Information Service' and its supporters, to {{misrepresent}} the facts regarding <b>international</b> <b>economic</b> <b>relationships</b> between EEC members and Japan. The methods used are reminiscent of those used triumphantly in Britain to persuade that country to join the EEC and now to obscure the adverse economic effects of membership. Therefore the Commission and its Information Service must be regarded only as an ambitious and as yet unrivalled 'pressure group' and not as a 'responsible government'. Some understanding of this situation can be obtained through the 'founding paradox'of the EEC - that whilst it purports to promote the 'liberal' ideals of an open world economy, in the service of free trade and peace, its very progress depends on a process of 'corporatist' power. Hope of reform lies in the emergence of strong 'liberal' opposition to the EEC from within member countries, and in countering that opposition the Commission seems to have chosen an unwelcome role for Japan...|$|R

40|$|Central {{question}} {{of this paper}} is what effects a state border has on the development of cross-border <b>economic</b> <b>relationships</b> in border regions. First the geographical spread of these relationships is analysed. Next a theoretical model is proposed to explain the pattern and the decision-process of bilateral <b>international</b> <b>economic</b> <b>relationships.</b> The model is mainly based on four theories: 1. the transaction costs approach on cross border economic relations under the condition of uncertainty. 2. The 'psychic distance' approach, which considers internationalization as an incremental learning process. The speed of the internationalization of a firm is determined by the experiential knowledge about the foreign country. 3. The network-approach, which considers (international) markets as networks. Firms are linked in patterns of cooperation and affiliation. Cooperation and not efficiency of transactions determine the behaviour of firms. 4. The socio-psychological approach of relations and social identity, which stresses the role of cognitive and affective aspects of cross-border relationships. These theories have lead to the model of INTERnational Formation of Autonomous Cooperation between Entrepreneurs (INTERFACE). The INTERFACE model distinguishes between different phases of relationship-building, namely contact, attraction (the choice for the partner), interaction (the negotiation about the conditions), transaction (the realization of the agreement/contract) and relationship. This relationship-development model is used to describe the process of the development of cross-border <b>economic</b> <b>relationships</b> and to explain the number and success of cross-border <b>economic</b> <b>relationships.</b> The model is empirically tested for a large sample of firms in two Dutch-Belgian border regions. The study is part of a dissertation on the development of cross-border <b>economic</b> <b>relationships.</b> The findings of the model suggests that the action-space of the firms, in terms of informal embeddedness and <b>economic</b> <b>relationships,</b> is spatially limited by the presence of the border. The factors of similarity and trust between the partners are found {{to be the most important}} determinants of success of cross-border <b>economic</b> <b>relationships.</b> The dimensions of expectations on the discrepancy in business conventions, the expectations on the success of economic relations in the neighbouring country and the strictness of the financial-economic terms of the relationship play a major role in determining the number of cross-border <b>economic</b> <b>relationships.</b> This is defined as the 'mental distance' effect of borders. ...|$|R
40|$|Social changes like <b>international</b> <b>economic</b> <b>relationships,</b> <b>economic</b> competitiveness, {{increasing}} {{importance of}} knowledge, etc. made it important for employees from all ages {{to keep on}} learning. However, {{research has shown that}} as employees age, their participation in education and training declines. This research investigates the reasons that stimulate or prohibit the participation in formal learning activities. It also investigates if differences exist between employees {{in the first half and}} second half of the career. Participants in this study were 628 employees. Several stimulating or prohibiting reasons for participation have been identified. This study found different significant differences when comparing employees with different ages and different seniorities. On the one hand, the required investments only differed significantly for the different age groups, this can be explained due to the fact that the required investments are more influenced by the personal situation (rather than working experience) of an employee like for example having a young child or having more financial constraints than older employees (new house etc). On the other hand ‘professional and personal development’ and ‘dispositional barriers’ only differed significantly when comparing groups with different seniorities. ‘Professional and personal development’ can be related with career expectations which in turn is related to their working experience and seniority. While dispositional barriers are partially coming from personal experiences, they are also determined by the climate in the organization; former research has suggested that employers tend to send a message to older employees that it is not expected from them to learn and develop further. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} {{globalization}} {{is one of}} the main trends when forming the system of <b>international</b> <b>economic</b> <b>relationships</b> in the third millennium. Global integration of the financial-banking system which provides for the intensification of the countries’ economic interdependence worldwide has become inevitable. The activity of international financial organizations has gained significant importance for Ukraine. In particular, after the crisis, lots of developing countries had no access to market financing, and resources, provided by international financial institutions, were crucially important for providing gradual adaptation to external and internal imbalances and disproportions which appeared due to the crisis. In Europe the following regional currency and credit organizations are operating: European Investment Bank, European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, European Monetary Cooperation Fund. Among the major international financial organizations, which operate in Ukraine, we can single out the following: International Monetary Fund, World Bank and European Bank of Reconstruction and Development. It should be noted that Ukraine is ranked as one of the leading in borrowings during the crisis among the countries of Central, Eastern and Southern Europe. The complex analysis shows the active cooperation of Ukraine with international financial organizations. However, without any changes or at least significant correction of socio-economic paradigm’s development Ukraine will fail to fulfill its financial and social obligations. However, against the background of negative factors, caused by external borrowings of Ukraine, the following new prospects of cooperation’s strategy between financial organizations and Ukraine in 2008 - 2011 should be defined, namely: modernization of the Ukrainian physical infrastructure, especially in the sectors of energy saving, stimulation of innovative activity, improvement of the environment for business, formation of "knowledge economy", development of labor skills and creation of new qualitative work places, improvement of government resources’ management, reformation of public assistance and pension system in order to reduce costs for administering existing systems...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to perform a comprehensive time series analysis of real and nominal exchange rates for the following Pacific-Basin countries: Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand in the seventies and eighties. The largest part of the research concentrates on the behaviour of real exchange rates. Contrary to most research that {{has been carried out}} so far, the exchange rate quotations for the calculation of the real exchange rate are not the official ones but the black market quotations. The black market exchange rates were used because the official ones for most of these countries were fixed and determined by the governments for our sample period and therefore the black market quotation was the one that corresponded to the forces of the market. A comprehensive analysis of the black market real exchange rate is carried out by applying different methods of time series analysis to these series. Each method gives some information about the underlying process of the series and so by combining all this information, a more detailed picture can be drawn. Furthermore, a comparison of tfie quantity and quality of the information gained by each approach is made. For some of the approaches more than one technique is applied to the same data set and therefore a very interesting comparison between these techniques can be made. In this case the current research {{can be seen as a}} critique of the popular time series methods and of their performance on the actual data. Another objective of the thesis is to investigate the underlying <b>international</b> <b>economic</b> <b>relationships</b> and <b>international</b> parities that result in a given behaviour of exchange rates. Purchasing power parity is the main underlying parity that we question through the behaviour of the real exchange rate for most of our research. A final objective is to examine the dynamic relationship between the mean of the black and official market exchange rates and between the variance of the rates...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 84 - 87) This study {{analyzed the}} economic structure of commercial television in Latin America. A theoretical framework {{was derived from}} the published writings on <b>international</b> <b>economic</b> <b>relationships</b> by leading Latin American social scientists who adhere to a perspective embracing dependency. Based on the exploratory studies of Schiller (1969), Pasquali (1972), and Nordenstreng and Varis (1974), the four institutions that control and manipulate the content of television via their economic interaction were determined to be the following: sponsors, advertising agencies, program distributors, and station owners. It was found that the first three of these institutions are distinguished in several Latin American countries by a high concentration of foreign investment. The influence of foreign investment in the fourth institution was found to be limited primarily to Central America. However, broadcasting surveys of countries such as Mexico and Brazil, whose television stations are owned by domestic industrialists, indicated that domestic and foreign owners relied on the same criteria in the selection of programs. A model set of relationships in the commercial television structure was developed from the analysis. The model evidences a dual role for television in the dependency framework. Television reflects dependency in the economic and cultural links within its structure. Television sustains dependency by its capacity to transmit and reinforce commercial values. It was found that consumerism transmitted by television generates a production-consumption cycle oriented toward the upper and middle classes, and away from the needs of the lower classes, by increasing demand in the direction of luxury products. The major conclusion {{of this study is that}} commercial television in Latin America reflects and sustains dependency as a natural development of the international capitalist system. As the literature review documents, the concentration of foreign investment in television has a parallel in many other industries throughout Latin America. The shift of emphasis from extractive industries to manufacturing has enlarged the role of television as a perpetuator of dependency. This study evidenced a consciousness on the part of multinational companies and domestic industrialists of how to utilize television for economic and social control...|$|R

40|$|It is {{theoretically}} {{clear and}} may be verified empirically that efficient financial markets can make it less necessary for policy to try and offset the welfare effects of labour income risk and unequal consumption dynamics.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of <b>international</b> <b>economic</b> {{law in the}} past two decades has been characterised by the growth and diversification of <b>international</b> <b>economic</b> actors, the expansion in the substantive areas governed by international law, and, crucially, the proliferation of multiple sites of <b>international</b> <b>economic</b> governance. This web of multi-layered <b>international</b> <b>economic</b> governance is, in turn, underpinned by complex dynamics of power which structure the legal and economic relations between the subjects of <b>international</b> <b>economic</b> law and other actors impacted by international legal rules and regulation. The challenge for international legal scholarship lay not only in mapping the multiple sites of <b>international</b> <b>economic</b> governance but also in unmasking the power dynamics inherent in <b>international</b> <b>economic</b> relations. Locating and analysing power relations underlying <b>international</b> <b>economic</b> law is to crucial to understanding the cause and effect of <b>international</b> <b>economic</b> rules and institutions for rulemaking.
