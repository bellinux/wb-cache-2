40|$|Objective: The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to understand the viscoelastic nature of Guar Gum - <b>Dead</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>Salt</b> (GG-DSS) based polymeric gel, a semisolid product; which is prepared with all natural ingredients to achieve finally a pharmaceutical value oriented medicated gel. Methods: The GG-DSS gel was prepared at room temperature (20 - 22 oC) in two series using the following compositions: guar gum, <b>Dead</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>salt,</b> glycerol, thymol, ethanol, seabuckturn oil, essential oils etc. by applying simple slow stirring method. Further, to investigate the basic properties of the GG-DSS gel i. e. moisture content, morphology, physico-chemical, antibacterial and rheological properties, standard methods were carried out. Special attention was paid to the dynamic viscoelastic behaviour of GG-DSS gel in order to obtain the fundamental data for handling of this medicated gel in the future. The influence of the content of GG, DSS and strain on the rheological properties as a function of angular frequency was recorded. Results: The viscoelastic properties of all GG-DSS medicated gels show that the storage modulus G’ is higher than loss modulus G” over the whole range of angular frequency (ω) region, and both moduli increase monotonously with the increase of ω. The complex viscosity, η* decreases exponentially with the increase of ω, however, there is not much influence of strain on the viscoelastic properties. Conclusion: Collected information about viscoelastic properties of semi-solid product (GG-DSS gel) will be beneficial for pharmaceutics and cosmetic manufacturers to understand the rheology of GG-DSS gel and can be used from the commercial production point of view. © 2015, International Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences.

40|$|<b>Dead</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>Salt</b> (DSS) {{contains}} 21 minerials including magnesium, calcium, sulfur, bromide, iodine, sodium, zinc {{and potassium}} etc. On the other hand, Guar Gum (GG) {{is a natural}} polysaccharide, water soluble, having highest molecular weight and good gelling property. Due to such advantageous properties of DSS and GG, it has been taken interest to prepare a user friendly medicated gel (designated as GG-DSS gel) adding additional ingredients:e. g. Glycerol, Thymol, Ethanol, Seabuckthorn oil, and essencial oils for the improvment of the gel's medicated values and healing properties for the curing of general skin diseases/treatment. In this study, the viscoelastic behavior of GG-DSS gels were characterized by dynamic storage (G') and loss (G") moduli and complex viscosity {{as a function of}} angular frequency. The effect of DSS concentration and temperature on these properties of GG-DSS gels was investigated. All GG-DSS gels having different amount DSS shows G' higher than G" over a wide range of angular frequency. Both moduli have the trends to increase with the increase of temperature (temperature varies from 28 °C to 50 °C), and increase with the increase of DSS concentration higher than about 10 %. In conclusion, it can be mentioned that the knowledge about the rheological properties of DSS-GG gels may be useful during the characterization of similar kinds of medicated gel. © 2016 Author(s).

40|$|AbstractA {{bacterium}} {{capable of}} tolerating some textile effluent {{conditions such as}} salinity and high temperature was used to decolorize methyl red (MR). Bacillus sp. isolated from <b>Dead</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>salt</b> was identified by 16 S rRNA phylogenetic identification as Bacillus ST (accession number: HQ 013327). The bacterium showed 98 % color removal under microaerophilic conditions in 24 h at 30 °C and 78 % at 80 °C {{in the presence of}} mannitol and NaCl. After decolorization an induced programmed cell death (PCD) was proposed to eliminate all living Bacillus ST cells. Acetic acid, which was linked to programmed cell death in yeast, was used in this study to examine its ability to induce PCD in bacteria as well. The acetic acid concentration used was enough to shift the culture pH from alkalinity to neutral. The formation of cytosolic caspase- 3 suggested that the programmed cell death occurs through an extrinsic pathway by which mitochondria are by passed and caspases are directly activated. Comet assay which proved death upon the addition of 80 mM acetic acid in 120 min as compared to gamma radiation killed cells. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed cell shrinking, chromatin condensation and membrane blebbing which are all signs of PCD. The mode by which this bacterium follows in programmed cell death is very similar to those in mammalian and yeast cells. The process is proposed to be safe, efficient and cheap for getting rid of cells after bioremediation of colored effluent...|$|E

40|$|Controlled drug {{delivery}} technology {{represents one of}} the most rapidly advancing areas of science in which several disciplines, such as chemistry, pharmaceutical technology, and medicine are contributing to human health care. The goal of {{drug delivery}} systems, is to deploy medications intact to specifically targeted organs and compartments of the body through a medium that can control administration of the active principle by means of either a physiological or chemical trigger. During the past decade, polymeric micro-nanoparticles, polymer micelles, and hydrogel-type materials have all been shown to be effective in enhancing drug targeting specificity, lowering systemic drug toxicity, improving treatment absorption rates, and providing protection for pharmaceuticals against biochemical degradation. The research activities reported in the present thesis are the result of experimental work performed at the Laboratory of Polymeric Materials for Biomedical and Environmental Applications (Biolab) of the Department of Chemistry and Industrial Chemistry of the University of Pisa and in part at SINTEF company (Trondheim, Norway). The aim of the present PhD thesis was mainly focused on the preparation of polymeric nanoparticles based on Poly(maleic anhydride–alt–butyl vinyl ether) 5 % grafted with methoxyPEG 2000 and 95 % grafted with 2 -methoxyethanol (VAM 41) loaded with human Hemoglobin to be used as artificial oxygen carriers. Nanoparticles were prepared by means of the co-precipitation technique performed under controlled conditions in order to minimize oxidative phenomena; nanoparticles characterization was carried out in terms of size, morphology and surface properties analysis, highlighting the feasibility of obtaining Hemoglobin loaded polymeric nanoparticles possessing suitable features to be used as artificial oxygen carriers. The maintenance of protein functional bioactivities, once loaded inside nanoparticles, was also investigated; results showed that although protein secondary and quaternary structure seems to be maintained, Hemoglobin oxidation takes place during the formulation process. To overcome this inactivating phenomenon different strategies were investigated including the introduction of several reducing agents inside the formulation system as well as the modification of the polymeric structure by means of the introduction of a conductive moiety. Although Hemoglobin oxidation phenomenon during the formulation process was not avoided, alterations regarding nanoparticles features were not observed, highlighting the versatility of the so developed system and opening promising perspectives in the development of VAM 41 based polymeric nanoparticles loaded with functional Hemoglobin. The use of Alginate as alternative polymeric matrix was also investigated; the formulation process based on the ionic gelation was optimised carrying out successfully the reduction of Alginate particles dimensions from a millimetric to a micrometric scale, without affecting particle protein contents. Results obtained during this research activity indicated Alginate as a potential polymeric matrix usable in the development of artificial oxygen carriers. Moreover, during a six months visiting period spent at SINTEF, the research activity was focused on the development of VAM 41 based polymeric nanoparticles loaded with <b>Dead</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>Salts,</b> to be used as dermal drug delivery system. VAM 41 polymer was applied in a water-in-oil mini-emulsion based formulation system, demonstrating the feasibility of obtaining polymeric nanoparticles loaded with <b>Dead</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>Salts</b> possessing suitable features in terms of size and morphology; a time controlled release profile of the loaded active principle was also detected, opening promising perspectives {{in the use of the}} so developed system in topical pharmaceutical applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{synchronous}} {{application of}} narrowband UVB phototherapy with 311 nm lamps (Philips TL- 01) and bathing in <b>Dead</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>salt</b> {{solution was evaluated}} in a multicentre trial (n = 60) in outpatients suffering from psoriasis vulgaris. The study design consisted of an initial therapy phase of up to 35 treatments (three to five times a week) followed by maintenance therapy with up to 35 further applications (once or twice a week). Evaluation was performed separately for patients in according-to-protocol (ATP) (n = 280) and intention-to-treat (ITT) (n = 692) groups. An overall significant improvement of the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score (P < 0. 05) could be shown for both groups during initial therapy with 71. 4 % improvement for ATP and 61 % for ITT patients. The mean PASI for ATP (values for ITT in parentheses) was 17. 7 (18. 6) at baseline, 9. 5 (10. 7) after 20 applications and 5. 2 (7. 4) {{at the end of}} initial therapy. On average, ATP patients received 3. 9 (3. 5) applications per week with a cumulative irradiation dose of 19. 5 J cm- 2 (16. 2 J cm- 2). The most frequent side-effect was erythema, observed in 8. 7 % of the patients. Subjective evaluation of the therapy by the patients (n = 168) was excellent. Seventy-nine per cent of patients preferred the new treatment strategy in comparison with other previous therapies and 88 % regarded this therapy as pleasant and comfortable. In conclusion, we could demonstrate a significant effect of therapy in both the ATP and the ITT groups for this new treatment system which imitates, as far as possible, the Dead Sea climatic conditions, with no severe side-effects and a high acceptance by the patients...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Pharmacoeconomic outcome {{research}} {{is based on}} three criteria: (i) evaluation of objective therapeutic effects; (ii) quality of life; and (iii) treatment costs. Evaluation of therapeutic effect is mainly {{based on the results}} of clinical trials using objective clinical measures, e. g: Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) (score for psoriasis vulgaris) and the Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) (score for atopic dermatitis). In most studies, only results for a treatment-optimized subpopulation (patients treated according to the protocol) are presented in publications. The relevance of such data for daily routine therapy is doubtful. OBJECTIVES: Our purpose was to investigate the expected loss of effectiveness of switching from a clinical trial to daily routine therapy for the synchronous application of narrow-band ultraviolet (UV) B phototherapy (311 nm) and bathing in 10 % <b>Dead</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>salt</b> solution (synchronous balneophototherapy) for patients with psoriasis vulgaris and atopic dermatitis. METHODS: We conducted a multicentre, uncontrolled observational study of outpatients. To achieve data for 'clinical trial' and 'daily routine' situations, two populations were compared: (i) all patients strictly treated according to the protocol (ATP) with no protocol deviations (data published in clinical trials), and (ii) all patients participating in the study who received active treatment at least once, despite treatment irregularities, non-compliance, early withdrawal or other protocol violations [intention-to-treat-population (ITT), model for 'daily routine']. RESULTS: A total of 2526 patients were included in the ITT analysis for psoriasis vulgaris (n = 487 for atopic dermatitis), of which 818 patients could be analysed according to protocol (n = 104 for atopic dermatitis). Striking differences in the therapeutic effect between both groups (ITT and ATP) were found using relative PASI and SCORAD score improvement: 11 % (57 % 'daily routine' vs. 68 % in 'clinical trial') for psoriasis vulgaris and 16 % (39 % 'daily routine' vs. 55 % 'clinical trial') for atopic dermatitis. The main reasons for excluding patients from the 'clinical trial' group were early study withdrawal in 29 % (atopic dermatitis, 47 %) of patients and fewer treatments per week than planned in the protocol in 24 % (atopic dermatitis, 52 %). CONCLUSIONS: Our data clearly indicate that for the prediction of the therapeutic effect for daily routine therapy the ITT data appear to be more relevant than the ATP results (i. e. those presented in clinical trials). Although these data are only a first step for evaluating the 'real' therapeutic effect of a treatment modality in daily routine, they seem to support the requirements for ITT analyses in efficacy studies and demonstrate the necessity of ITT data for pharmacoeconomic evaluation...|$|E

The age of the meromictic structure is estimated by a model which requires that the radium inventory of the lake be at a steady state, that sometime in the past the radium profile of the lake had been uniform (when either the lake was monomictic or an overturn had ended an earlier meromictic phase) and that the contemporaneous {{profiles of}} radium have been built up by inflows of radium solely into the upper water mass, while the monimolimnion is relict, isolated, and loses radium only by radioactive decay.
