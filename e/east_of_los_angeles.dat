U.S. Route 70 was {{extended}} west from Arizona ca. 1936 along the whole route to Los Angeles, and, between 1933 and 1942, US 99 moved from US 66 to present I-10 between San Bernardino and Los Angeles, forming a three-way concurrency between Pomona and Los Angeles.

500|$|Thus Hunter {{was fifteen}} when he emigrated {{with his parents}} and two {{surviving}} siblings to California. Initially, {{he lived with his}} family on an orange grove, 50 miles <b>east</b> <b>of</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles.</b> He continued sketching and loved the climate, but showed little interest in farm management. Hunter began making a living in 1896, primarily as a newspaper and journal illustrator. He mixed with significant literary figures such as Bret Harte and Jack London, who were associated with the San Francisco Bohemian Club. Hunter provided illustrations for Overland Monthly. In 1899, a full-page black and white drawing for Overland Monthly is signed G. Leslie Hunter, the first recorded occasion of his use of [...] "Leslie." [...] In 1902, Hunter became {{part of a group of}} artists that included Maynard Dixon and Arthur Putnam. They desired independence from the hierarchies of the establishment art world and, together, they formed the California Society of Arts as an alternative to the conservative San Francisco Art Association. Clearly, Hunter had a completely different artistic exposure compared with others of the Scottish Colourists group, such as John Duncan Fergusson or Samuel John Peploe. Hunter was at this stage quite a successful American graphic artist, considering his young age.

500|$|The {{sequence}} wherein Mulder runs {{was shot}} on a motorcycle. Manners recalled that, because Duchovny {{had been able}} to outrun two horses in the fourth season episode [...] "Tunguska", he needed something faster to film the scene with. Several locations that were scouted for the episode proved difficult to use. Two churches that had been selected for the episode pulled out just before filming began and replacements had to be found immediately. The scenes in the woods were filmed at Griffith Park in Los Angeles. The location was chosen because it possessed [...] "probably the only pine trees in Los Angeles". Due {{to the fact that the}} actual park is rather sparsely populated by brush, the foliage was all created by the crew of the series. Manners shot several of the forest scenes with a 200 millimeter lens, so that the lights of Los Angeles would be disguised in the distance. Padgett's furnace was filmed on a set called the red/blue room. It had originally been created for the sixth seasoner opener [...] "The Beginning". The jail set was constructed in a large warehouse by a different production company. The X-Files rented the space for several days for filming, for five thousand dollars. Finding a graveyard with [...] "old-fashioned vertical tombstones" [...] proved a challenge for locations manager Ilt Jones. Eventually one was found in Altadena, California, <b>east</b> <b>of</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles.</b> The fog in the cemetery was created by burying small [...] "misters" [...] that produced water vapor. The vapor was cold so that it would stay low to the group and emulate the properties of actual fog.|$|E

2500|$|The Southwestern United States (also {{known as}} the American Southwest) is the {{informal}} name for a region of the western United States. Definitions vary a great deal and have never been standardized--and many have been proposed.

[...] The population for that particular definition area is around 11 million people, with over half that {{in the state of}} Arizona.

2500|$|The isoseismal map {{for this}} event is {{somewhat}} symmetrical, but with a significant east–west elongation that is aligned with the transverse ranges. The Mercalli intensity peaked at VII (Very strong) {{in the area around}} Desert Hot Springs. Intensity VI (Strong) effects were observed in Los Angeles, where damage was slight and several hundred automatic gas shutoff valves were tripped, especially in Monterey Park (just to the <b>east</b> <b>of</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles).</b> At roughly the same distance from the epicenter, San Diego had more intense effects than El Centro did. Intensity VI was felt in San Diego, while El Centro was marked as I–IV (Not Felt–Light). This was likely due to a difference in local geological features, and the attenuation factor along the path to each area, sometimes called [...] "earthquake shadows".|$|E

The mother raised her sons alone while putting herself through school and starting her own business, a vocational center.

2500|$|What is now Interstate 10 <b>east</b> <b>of</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> was {{generally}} {{part of the}} Atlantic and Pacific Highway, one of many transcontinental national auto trails. By 1926, when the United States Numbered Highways were assigned, the road across the desert east of Indio was unimproved, while the road from Indio west to San Bernardino (as well as various roads west to Los Angeles) was paved. In late 1926, U.S. Route 99 was designated along the section of road from San Bernardino to Indio, where it turned south along present State Route 86 {{on the west side}} of the Salton Sea. West of San Bernardino, US 99 ran to Los Angeles concurrent with U.S. Route 66 (via Pasadena) before turning north; this route to Los Angeles is north of the later alignment of Interstate 10.
