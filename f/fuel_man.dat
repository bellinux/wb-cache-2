500|$|The 1992 Hooters 500, {{the final}} {{race of the}} 1992 season, is {{considered}} one of the most eventful races in NASCAR history. It was the final race for Richard Petty and the first for Jeff Gordon. Sixdrivers were close enough in the points standings to win the championship that day. Allison led second-place Kulwicki by 30 points, Bill Elliott by 40, Harry Gant by 97, and Kyle Petty by 98 and needed to finish sixth or better to clinch the championship. Kulwicki received approval from NASCAR and Ford to change the [...] "Thunderbird" [...] lettering on his bumper for the race to [...] "underbird" [...] because he felt like the underdog in the contention for the championship. During Kulwicki's first pit stop, the first gear in the car's transmission broke. Andrews said, [...] "We had to leave pit road in fourth gear, because we had broken metal parts in there, and only by leaving it in fourth are you not going to move metal around as much. We could only hope that the loose piece of metal didn't get in there and break the gears in half. We had three or fourpit stops after it broke. I held my breath all day long." [...] Allison was racing in sixthplace, closely behind Ernie Irvan, when Irvan's tire blew with 73 (of 328) laps left in the event. As a result, Allison ran into the side of Irvan's spinning car and his car was too damaged to continue. Kulwicki and Elliott were left to duel for the title. While leading late in the race, Andrews calculated the exact lap for his final pit stop so that Kulwicki would be guaranteed to lead the most laps and would gain fivebonus points. Kulwicki made his final pit stop only after leading enough laps to guarantee the bonus points. To save time, the pit crew did a fuel-only pit stop. Not changing tires allowed them to be available to push the car to prevent it from stalling, since the car had to start moving in a higher gear. Because the team's <b>fuel</b> <b>man</b> hurried to add the gasoline during the quick stop, he did not add the desired amount into the tank. As a result, Kulwicki had to conserve fuel to ensure that his car was still running at the end of the race. Elliott won the race and Kulwicki stretched his fuel to finish second. Kulwicki won the 1992 Winston Cup Championship by maintaining his 10-point lead over Elliott. He celebrated the championship with his second Polish victory lap. Always conscious of his appearance for potential sponsors, Kulwicki combed his hair, making a national television audience wait for him to emerge from his car.|$|E

50|$|Nick Heidfeld was {{involved}} in an incident in the pit lane where the lollipop man lifted whilst the fuel hose was still attached, and the <b>fuel</b> <b>man</b> was dragged along as the Jordan pulled away. The Saubers were on a long first stint and Giancarlo Fisichella did not pit until lap 25, surprisingly rejoining in the points. Meanwhile, Button was closing the gap to Ralf Schumacher, as Montoya did likewise to Ralf's older brother Michael.Minardi's Gianmaria Bruni was hauled in for a drive through penalty for speeding in the pit lane, but retired with gearbox failure shortly after. Ralf pitted again on lap 33, and rejoined in 3rd whilst Coulthard narrowly missed another collision with a fiery Christian Klien. In the second stint, Barrichello was seemingly much faster than his teammate Michael Schumacher, but {{could not find a}} way past the reigning champion. Alonso began to fly in fourth, as the adventurous Klien took an airborne trip over the grass. Alonso's charge was short-lived though, as his Renault pulled slowly {{to the side of the}} circuit with a driveshaft failure. Räikkönen, Barrichello and Michael Schumacher took their second pit stops without much hassle, although Schumacher had a leary moment when he almost hit the pit wall.|$|E
5000|$|Kulwicki {{was quite}} vocal that his 278-point deficit would {{probably}} be his undoing, and that the Dover race result would keep him from contending for the season title. He was quoted as saying, [...] "This probably finishes us off in the championship deal." [...] On October 11, Mark Martin had a narrow victory over Kulwicki at the Mello Yello 500 at Charlotte. For the second race in a row, points leader Bill Elliott had problems, which left six drivers within reach of the title with three races left to go. Elliott had problems again at the second-to-last race, and his cracked cylinder head allowed race winner Davey Allison to take the points lead, with fourth place finisher Kulwicki second in season points and Elliott third.The 1992 Hooters 500, the final race of the 1992 season, {{is considered one of}} the most eventful races in NASCAR history.

50|$|The US forces regrouped {{themselves}} and blasted the bridges on the Amblève and the River Salm that Peiper needed to cross {{in order to}} continue on a direct road to the Meuse. On 18 December, United States Army Corps of Engineers blasted the bridges in front of him that he needed to reach his objective, trapping him in the deep valley of the Amblève, downstream from Trois-Ponts. The weather had also improved, permitting the Allied Air Forces to operate. Several P-47 squadrons attacked his column spread over 20 km. The air strikes destroyed or heavily damaged numerous vehicles of his Kampfgruppe and made some parts of his itinerary impracticable, slowing down his progression. Peiper was unable to protect his rear, which enabled American troops to recapture and destroy the bridge on the Amblève in Stavelot, cutting him off from the only possible supply road for ammunition and, above all, fuel, which he lacked. In spite of these problems, Peiper continued his progress towards Stoumont before American resistance forced him to retire to La Gleize. Short of <b>fuel,</b> <b>men</b> and ammunition he held out during six days of US Army bombardment and counterattacks. Without supplies and with no contact with other German units behind him, Peiper decided on 24 December to abandon his vehicles and march through the woods to escape. He left with the remaining 800 men and 36 hours later he reached the German lines with 770 men, having covered 20 kilometers by foot in deep snow and freezing temperatures.|$|R

Indeed we have brought the truth to you, but most of you have a hatred for the truth." [...] A later verse from the Qur'an makes it clear that Malik and the other angels who punish people in hell aren't deciding to do so themselves; instead, they're carrying out God's commands: [...] "O you who believe! Save yourselves and your families from a fire Jahannam whose <b>fuel</b> is <b>men</b> and stones, over which are appointed angels stern and severe, who flinch not executing the commands they receive from God, but do precisely what they are commanded" [...] (chapter 66 (At-Tahrim), verse 6).|$|R

Carbon in the form of carbon dioxide (C 02) {{is one of the major}} contributors to the natural greenhouse effect. As a result of the increase in the combustion of fossil <b>fuels</b> by <b>man,</b> the amount of CO 2 in the atmosphere and therefore the greenhouse effect increases. In order to be able to forecast a reliable scenario of the possible future consequences of an increased greenhouse effect (climate change, melting ice caps, rising sea level, etc.) it is essential to understand the natural cycle of carbon in the geosphere and biosphere. In the marine environment CO 2 is incorporated into organic matter by algae during photosynthesis. Organic matter containing organic carbon (Corg) is largely mineralized in the water column and at the sea floor, during this process CO 2 is produced. A small part however is buried in marine deposits, attached to fine grained sediments. In this manner a part of the carbon is withdrawn from the carbon cycle for a long period of time.
