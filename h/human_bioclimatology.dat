40|$|Adequate {{research}} in the peripheral field of medical geography requires familiarity with the literature of medicine, geography, and other environmentally oriented fields. The pertinent literature of the two primary disciplines, {{as well as that}} of anthropology, nutrition, and <b>human</b> <b>bioclimatology,</b> is surveyed from a bibliographical point of view. A brief review of historical sources is presented, followed by a discussion of the contemporary organizations, both international and national, active in the field. Emphasis is placed on the publishing programs and projects, maps, atlases, symposia, reports, and other literature sponsored or stimulated by these organizations. Regional bibliographical surveys for East Africa, India, and the Soviet Union are also noted. Pertinent aspects of bibliographies, indexes, abstracts, library card catalogs and accession lists, and other resources are listed, with emphasis on the various subject headings and other approaches to them. Throughout, the sources of information are approached from a multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary viewpoint...|$|E
40|$|The diploma thesis {{provides}} special {{studies from}} the <b>human</b> <b>bioclimatology</b> sector. Ten year sequences (2001 - 2010) of many meteorological components are processed here. The meteorological components are as follows: average daily air temperature, average daily wind speed, time of sunshine per day, duration of rainfalls, fogs and fumes and also monthly aggregate rainfall. The main study aims attention to evaluation of complex effects of selected elements on humans. The most {{and the least}} suitable season {{of the year for}} performing outdoor activities for a human were found, including optimal definition of summer holidays. Further studies concern the problems of air pollution related with synoptic situation. Sufficient space has been also given to more studies relating to wind chill or relations among individual meteorological elements, which can be helpful while forecasting the weather. With the help of particular data provided by Liberec hospital, the correlation between amounts of patients with particular diseases and changes of selected meteorological elements has been discovered...|$|E
40|$|It {{has long}} been known that weather and climate have {{influence}} on human health and well-being. The human organism is in constant interaction with the environmental conditions. To access the atmospheric impact on humans, different methods in <b>human</b> <b>bioclimatology</b> are created. Most of them are based on human heat balance. In this paper it has been tried to present several bioclimatic indices based on the human heat balance according to the bioclimatic model menex (man-environment exchange). The aim {{of this paper is to}} present bioclimatic conditions in Banja Luka vicinage (Bosnia and Herzegovina) and to explore climate-recreation relationship. In the near vicinity of Banja Luka there are three spa centers that are favorable for recreation. For this analysis average available daily weather data for two extreme months (January and July, 1990) were used as well as the average monthly weather values for the period 1961 - 1990. The data were taken from Banja Luka weather station. As a result, several thermophisiological bioclimatic indices have been obtained. These are heat load in man, physiological strain, subjective temperature, subjective physiological temperature...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} part of {{the research}} in the field of <b>human</b> <b>bioclimatology</b> and refers to biothermal conditions in different geographical environments in Serbia: an urban area and a mountain of medium height. The goal of the paper was to show bioclimatic differences during the summer between the city of Belgrade (116 m a. s. l.) and the mountain resort of Zlatibor (1498 m a. s. l.). The basic principle of bioclimatic analysis is the human heat balance between man and environment. This methodological approach is a combination of physiological and meteorological parameters that result in thermophysiological bioclimatic indices: heat load (HL) in man and the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI). For this analysis, weather data for July, as the warmest month, was obtained, using daily meteorological data for the decade from 2000 to 2010. Results for July indicate a considerable difference between the two abovementioned environments. HL in Belgrade was dominated by degrees of comfort “hot” and “extremely hot, with the highest value of 4. 540, while for Zlatibor the dominant degree of comfort was “warm”. The UTCI in Belgrade has dominated by strong heat stress and moderate heat stress, compared to Zlatibor where the UTCI is dominated by moderate heat stress. In addition, a significant {{part of the}} monitored decade on Mt. Zlatibor was without heat stress, with the exception of 2006 and 2007, indicating favorable biothermal characteristics. Therefore, compared to Belgrade, with its considerably lower overall heat stress Zlatibor has the characteristics of a site with favorable bioclimatic qualities...|$|E
40|$|Este estudo se insere no campo de saber da Bioclimatologia Humana, sob a perspectiva das ideias de Besancenot (2001, 2002). Buscou-se identificar correlaÃÃes fortes e estatisticamente significantes entre as anomalias das temperaturas extremas do ar e de outros atributos climÃticos (temperatura mÃxima, mÃdia e mÃnima do ar, {{amplitude}} tÃrmica do ar, temperatura efetiva - Ãndice Te, umidade relativa do ar, velocidade dos ventos e precipitaÃÃo) e a morbidade por DoenÃas Cardiovasculares - DCV - de pacientes idosos, residentes e atendidos em hospitais pÃblicos e conveniados ao SUS para constataÃÃo de ocorrÃncias de ondas de calor e de frio na cidade de Fortaleza no perÃodo de 2004 a 2009. Dos perÃodos tÃrmicos de maior intensidade registrados nos anos da sÃrie das temperaturas extremas do ar, quatro correspondem a perÃodos de calor Forte (eventos dos anos 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 e 2008), e um representa um perÃodo de frescor Forte (evento do ano de 2009). Somente foram certificadas correlaÃÃes fortes em nÃvel p < 0, 05 entre a temperatura mÃnima do ar, a amplitude tÃrmica, as anomalias da temperatura mÃnima, a precipitaÃÃo e as internaÃÃes hospitalares para o episÃdio tÃrmico positivo do ano de 2007. As medidas de risco relativo (intervalos de confianÃa a 95 %) indicaram que a amplitude tÃrmica do ar e a precipitaÃÃo mostraram-se associadas como fator protetor. Em vÃrias associaÃÃes, sobretudo nas do episÃdio do ano de 2007, o aumento do risco relativo no total de internaÃÃes hospitalares ocorreu em nÃvel boderline. Concluiu-se que os perÃodos de calor e de frescor Forte da sÃrie 2004 â 2009 nÃo se configuraram como ondas de calor ou frio devido Ã ausÃncia de correlaÃÃes fortes e estatisticamente significantes entre as temperaturas extremas ar, as anomalias tÃrmicas e as internaÃÃes hospitalares. Ao considerar a ideia de que as ondas de calor e de frio se definem mais em termos epidemiolÃgicos do que meteorolÃgicos, e que esses eventos extremos atingem, de forma seletiva, a populaÃÃo, em especial, idosos portadores de doenÃas cardÃacas, grupo etÃrio mais vulnerÃvel aos eventos, fica estabelecido, em termos estatÃsticos, que os perÃodos de calor e frescor Forte ocorridos em Fortaleza, no perÃodo de 2004 a 2009, nÃo funcionaram como um dispositivo ambiental no agravo de doenÃas cardiovasculares da populaÃÃo idosa de FortalezaThis study {{falls into}} the scope of <b>Human</b> <b>Bioclimatology</b> under the perspective of ideas by Besancenot (2001, 2002). We sought to identify strong and statistically significant correlations between anomalies of extreme air temperatures and other climatic attributes (maximum, mean and minimum air temperature, thermal amplitude, thermal comfort index- Te- index, relative humidity, wind speed and precipitation) and Cardiovascular Disease - CVD morbidity of elderly patients treated in public and convened hospitals, in order to detect occurrences of heat and cold waves {{in the city of}} Fortaleza for the period 2004 - 2009. Among the thermal periods with greater intensity recorded in the years of the series of extreme air temperatures, four corresponded to periods of strong heat (events in 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008) and one referred to a period of strong freshness (event in 2009). We verified strong correlations (p< 0. 05) between minimum air temperature, thermal amplitude, anomalous minimal temperature and precipitation and hospitalizations only for the positive thermal episode of 2007. The measures of relative risk and 95 % confidence interval indicated that air thermal amplitude and precipitation were associated as a protective factor. In many associations, particularly those concerning the episode of the year 2007, the increase in relative risk for total hospitalizations occurred in a borderline level. It was concluded that heat and fresh periods of the series 2004 - 2009 were not configured as heat or cold waves {{due to the lack of}} strong and statistically significant correlations between extreme air temperatures, thermal anomalies and hospitalizations. Given that heat and cold waves are defined more meteorologically than epidemiologically and affect the population selectively, especially elderly patients with heart disease (age group most vulnerable to the events), it was statistically established that the heat and cold periods that occurred in Fortaleza in the period 2004 - 2009 did not work as an environmental device in aggravation of cardiovascular disease in the elderly population of Fortalez...|$|E
