40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{incentives}} to divert {{search for an}} information intermediary who enables buyers (consumers) to search affiliated sellers (stores). We identify two original motives for diverting search (i. e. inducing consumers to search more than they would like) : i) trading off <b>higher</b> total <b>consumer</b> <b>traffic</b> for <b>higher</b> revenues per consumer visit; ii) influencing stores’ choices of strategic variables (e. g. pricing) once they have decided to affiliate. We characterize {{the conditions under which}} there would be no role for search diversion as a strategic instrument for the intermediary, thereby showing that it occurs even when the contracting space is significantly enriched. We then discuss several applications related to on-line and brick-and-mortar intermediaries...|$|R
50|$|Televisions {{displayed}} behind {{two-way mirror}} glass had {{been available for}} roughly 15 years but had been isolated to the hospitality and residential markets. Mirrus had the vision of creating a mirror technology that would be utilized in <b>high</b> <b>consumer</b> <b>traffic</b> areas {{for the purposes of}} advertising. The company developed a mirror technology in which video ads can be scheduled and sent via the Internet to a specific mirror anywhere in the world. The Mirror Technology displays high definition video ads until a consumer approaches or engages the unit. Once engaged, the video or ad playing in the unit migrates and continues to play {{in the corner of the}} unit while the remainder screen instantly becomes a fully functioning mirror. As the consumer walks away from the mirror the video advertisement reverts to full size, until approached by the next consumer.|$|R
40|$|Key Words: cyclostationarity, {{spectrum}} sensing, <b>high</b> <b>traffic</b> circumstance In {{cognitive radio}} (CR) systems, the secondary user (SU) performs the spectrum sensing {{to determine the}} presence of the primary user (PU) on the PU's frequency band. In practical cases, the PU would arrive and depart randomly in the sensing duration of the SU, which {{is referred to as the}} <b>high</b> <b>traffic</b> circumstance. In this paper, we propose a cyclostationarity-based spectrum sensing scheme for CR systems in <b>high</b> <b>traffic</b> circumstances. From numerical results, it is confirmed that the proposed scheme outperforms both the energy detector proposed for <b>high</b> <b>traffic</b> circumstances and the conventional cyclostationarity-based spectrum sensin...|$|R

Specifically, we partition a sensing time into K sub-sections, and then, propose a spectrum sensing scheme that determines if a primary user signal is present based on the sensing results on the partitioned sub-sections. From numerical results, {{it is confirmed that}} the proposed scheme outperforms the conventional schemes in <b>high</b> <b>traffic</b> environments...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze gaseous organic {{chemicals}} (GOCs) of <b>high</b> <b>traffic</b> (Nishinomiya City: 979, 987 vehicles/day) and low traffic areas (Miki City: 29, 338 ve-hicles/day) by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and to evaluate general envi-ronment exposure by PAHs in GOCs. After air sampling using an OMNIPORE membrane filter (< 0. 45 µm) and Porapak-QS, sorbents were extracted with solvent (dichloromethane: ace-tone (4 : 1 v/v), and analysis was carried out by GC-MS. Oxidative derivatives of diethylbenzene, such as diacethylbenzene and ethylacetophenone, were detected in GOCs. PAHs and phtha-lates in GOCs were measured. Pyrene, benz[a]anthracene, benzo[a]pyrene and benzo[ghi]perylene level were significantly <b>higher</b> in <b>high</b> <b>traffic</b> areas. The geometric mean of pyrene was 0. 76 ng/m 3 for low traff ic areas and 1. 96 ng/m 3 for high traff ic areas; benz[a]anthracene was found at 0. 72 ng/m 3 and 1. 80 ng/m 3 in low and <b>high</b> <b>traffic</b> areas, respectively; benzo[a]pyrene was found at 0. 87 ng/m 3 and 3. 60 ng/m 3 in low and <b>high</b> <b>traffic</b> areas, respectively and benzo[ghi]perylene was found at 0. 57 ng/m 3 and 3. 04 ng/m 3 in low and <b>high</b> <b>traffic</b> areas, respectively. The bis(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) level was the high-est in the detected GOCs. The geometric mean of the DEHP levels in <b>high</b> <b>traffic</b> and low traffi...|$|R

30|$|We {{conclude}} that DQ-MAC {{is superior to}} both the standard 802.15. 4 and the BSN-MAC in terms of energy consumption for <b>high</b> <b>traffic</b> loads (i.e., 80 % traffic load) and all packet lengths. This {{can be explained by}} understanding the inherent DQ-MAC behavior of avoiding collisions in data transmissions, idle listening, and overhearing, at the cost of some small protocol overhead, which remains invisible for <b>high</b> <b>traffic</b> loads. Thus, DQ-MAC reduces the most critical energy-consumption features of other state-of-the-art MAC protocols under <b>high</b> <b>traffic</b> conditions, and for this reason it might be a suitable candidate for star-based BSNs in medical settings, completing our work in [2].|$|R

30|$|As {{previously}} analyzed, DQ-MAC {{achievement is}} most relevant for <b>high</b> <b>traffic</b> loads than for low traffic loads. Remember though that DQ-MAC may behave adaptively, that is, granting immediate access for light traffic loads and seamlessly {{moving to a}} reservation system (i.e., CRQ and DTQ) for <b>high</b> <b>traffic</b> loads. Again this shows the good inherent performance of the protocol {{also in terms of}} energy-consumption.|$|R
