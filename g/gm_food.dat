Some {{countries}} have approved but not actually cultivated GM crops, due to public uncertainty or further government restrictions, while at the same time, they may import GM foods for consumption. For example, Japan is a leading <b>GM</b> <b>food</b> importer, and permits but has not grown <b>GM</b> <b>food</b> crops. The European Union regulates importation of GM foods, while individual member states determine cultivation.

This research investigates the perception and attitudes of unlabeled <b>GM</b> <b>foods</b> of the WKU faculty and staff. A survey was administered via WKU Qualtrics, and chi-square tests were performed {{to see how the}} benefits and disadvantages of <b>GM</b> <b>foods</b> may affect the purchasing decisions of the educated consumer, and to see if the WKU faculty and staff wants <b>GM</b> <b>foods</b> to be labeled or not. The research confirms that the benefits and disadvantages of <b>GM</b> <b>foods</b> do affect the purchasing decisions of the educated consumer. The survey revealed that about 60 % of the WKU faculty and staff buys <b>GM</b> <b>foods,</b> and 40 % do not buy <b>GM</b> <b>foods,</b> and approximately 92 % of the WKU faculty and staff wants <b>GM</b> <b>foods</b> to have proper labeling and information. The research provides information about how the educated consumer of Kentucky may feel about unlabeled <b>GM</b> <b>foods.</b> The research also recommends some trade-off benefits of <b>GM</b> <b>foods,</b> including that approximately 35 % of the WKU faculty and staff reported that they would buy <b>GM</b> <b>foods</b> if it helps to lower cholesterol and fight diabetes, and 20 % say they would buy <b>GM</b> <b>foods</b> if it is cheaper than other foods. Some of the disadvantages of <b>GM</b> <b>foods</b> are that the pesticide chemicals used in the production methods of <b>GM</b> <b>foods</b> are toxic to humans, animals, and the environment. Approximately 54 % of the participants say they would not buy <b>GM</b> <b>foods</b> because they are concerned about how it may affect their long-term health, and about 35 % reported that they don’t buy <b>GM</b> <b>foods</b> because of improper labeling and information...|$|R

40|$|There {{is concern}} {{about the extent to}} which {{consumers}} will accept genetically modified (<b>GM)</b> <b>foods</b> if they are commercialized in China. The evidence from the existing literature is mixed and sometimes confusing. The objective of this study is to conduct a large in-depth face-to-face in house survey that examines the consumers' awareness, acceptance of and willingness to buy <b>GM</b> <b>foods</b> in China. To achieve this objective, a well designed consumer survey was conducted in I I cities of five provinces in Eastern China in 2002 and 2003. The results indicate that despite much less information on <b>GM</b> <b>foods</b> available publicly in China, more than two thirds of consumers in urban areas have heard of <b>GM</b> <b>foods.</b> But their knowledge on biotechnology was limited. Chinese consumers' acceptance of and willingness to buy <b>GM</b> <b>foods</b> was much higher than in other countries. Chinese consumers also demonstrated great variance in their acceptance of different <b>GM</b> <b>foods.</b> Information and prices of <b>GM</b> <b>foods</b> were two important factors affecting consumers' attitudes toward <b>GM</b> <b>foods.</b> Based on the findings of this study and given that our sample is in the more developed eastern Urban China, we conclude that the commercialization of <b>GM</b> <b>foods</b> is not likely to receive great resistance from the consumers in China.

This study illuminates agricultural professionals' insights toward <b>GM</b> <b>foods</b> in Southwest Iran. A random sample of 262 respondents was studied. The results indicated {{that the majority of the}} respondents had little knowledge about <b>GM</b> <b>foods.</b> They perceived few benefits or risks of <b>GM</b> <b>foods.</b> Their perceived benefits and trust in individuals and institutions had positive impacts on the behavioral intentions of the agricultural professionals.

25|$|Lecithin is a {{naturally}} occurring lipid. It {{can be found}} in egg yolks and oil-producing plants. it is an emulsifier and thus is used in many foods. Corn, soy and safflower oil are sources of lecithin, though the majority of lecithin commercially available is derived from soy. Sufficiently processed lecithin is often undetectable with standard testing practices. According to the FDA, no evidence shows or suggests hazard to the public when lecithin is used at common levels. Lecithin added to foods amounts to only 2 to 10 percent of the 1 to 5 g of phosphoglycerides consumed daily on average. Nonetheless, consumer concerns about <b>GM</b> <b>food</b> extend to such products. This concern led to policy and regulatory changes in Europe in 2000, when Regulation (EC) 50/2000 was passed which required labelling of food containing additives derived from GMOs, including lecithin. Because of the difficulty of detecting the origin of derivatives like lecithin with current testing practices, European regulations require those who wish to sell lecithin in Europe to employ a comprehensive system of Identity preservation (IP).|$|E
