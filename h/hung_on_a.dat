5|$|The {{earliest}} type of tower {{used was}} a massive self-supporting delta pylon, or waist pylon, which consumed 21 tonnes of steel per kilometre of line. This type of pylon {{was used for the}} first 735kV power line from the Manic-Outardes power stations to the load centre of Montreal. There are two significant variations of the delta pylon; one has longer side crossbars such that all three bundles of conductors are suspended on V-shaped insulators. The other has shorter side crossbars, such that the two outside bundles are <b>hung</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> vertical insulator string and only the middle bundle is hung with a V-shaped insulator.|$|E
5|$|Maniac Mansions {{story and}} {{structure}} were designed before coding commenced. The project's earliest incarnation {{was a simple}} paper-and-pencil board game, in which the mansion's floor plan {{was used as a}} game board, and cards represented events and characters. Lines connected the rooms to illustrate pathways by which characters could travel. Strips of cellulose acetate were used to map out the game's puzzles by tracking which items worked together when used by certain characters. Impressed by the map's complexity, Winnick included it in the final game as a poster <b>hung</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> wall. Because each character contributes different skills and resources, the pair spent months working on the event combinations that could occur. This extended the game's production time beyond that of previous Lucasfilm Games projects, which almost led to Gilbert's firing. The game's dialogue, written by David Fox, was not created until after programming had begun.|$|E

5|$|The rolls {{were all}} of roughly the same length, about 5.5m (15ft), and would most likely have been {{presented}} side by side for display on a table or <b>hung</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> wall. The {{focal point of the}} whole composition is in the second, middle roll where the exceptionally well-executed painting of the Galley Subtle is placed. That this ship was intended to be the centrepiece illustration is made clear by the presence of the pinnace Mary James in the first roll, which is otherwise reserved for (sailing) ships. This appears to have originally been placed {{at the beginning of the}} third roll, among the other pinnaces and rowbarges, but was moved to achieve more equal lengths. In his pursuit of living up to the image of a Renaissance prince Henry is known to have been particularly fond of galleys, something which would have been known to Anthony.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} methods of burial: the coffin may be laid {{in a cave}} or in a carved stone grave, or <b>hung</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> cliff. It {{contains}} any possessions that the deceased will need in the afterlife. The wealthy are often buried in a stone grave carved out of a rocky cliff. The grave is usually expensive and takes {{a few months to}} complete. In some areas, a stone cave may be found that is large enough to accommodate a whole family. A wood-carved effigy, called Tau tau, is usually placed in the cave looking out over the land. The coffin of a baby or child may be hung from ropes on a cliff face or from a tree. This hanging grave usually lasts for years, until the ropes rot and the coffin falls to the ground.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was a Biker Chain {{match for the}} WWE Championship between Brock Lesnar and The Undertaker. During the match, a chain was <b>hung</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> pole above the ring, and once it was {{retrieved}} {{it could be used}} as a legal weapon. After enduring a series of punches from Lesnar, Undertaker attempted to take the chain down, but the lights in the arena went out and he climbed back down to the ring. Taker then executed a piledriver on Lesnar onto the ring steps. Taker put Lesnar in a dragon sleeper. After getting out of the hold, Lesnar executed a F-5 to Taker. Lesnar made an attempt to go for the chain, but Taker performed a chokeslam off the top rope. Following this, The Full Blooded Italians interfered in the match, trying to attack Taker. Taker threw them out of the ring and did a suicide dive onto them after performing a Last Ride on Lesnar. He then retrieved the chain off the pole and wrapped it around it his fist, planning to strike Lesnar with it. Vince McMahon interfered and pushed Taker off the top rope. Lesnar then punched Taker with the chain to retain the title.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} at No Mercy was a Biker Chain {{match for the}} WWE Championship. In this match, a chain was <b>hung</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> pole above the ring, {{and when it was}} {{retrieved}} it {{could be used as a}} legal weapon. The match was between WWE Champion Brock Lesnar, who defended against The Undertaker. This title match would mark the third pay per view between Lesnar and The Undertaker for the championship. The first being September 2002 at Unforgiven where Lesnar and Undertaker fought to a double disqualification then the second event being the following month at No Mercy where Lesnar successfully defended the WWE title over the Undertaker in a Hell in a Cell match. The buildup to the match began on the August 28 episode of SmackDown, when the Undertaker defeated Lesnar and The Big Show in a Triple Threat match, earning a title shot against then WWE Champion Kurt Angle. The following week on the September 4 episode of SmackDown, Angle defended the championship against the Undertaker, however, the match ended in a no contest after Lesnar interfered and attacked them both with a steel folding chair; Angle retained the championship as a result of Lesnar's interference. Two weeks later on SmackDown, Angle defended the title against Lesnar in a match in which the wrestler with the most scoring conditions by a set period of time would win the title in what is called an Iron Man match. Lesnar scored five falls, while Angle scored four in the encounter, thus, Lesnar won the match and became the new WWE Champion. The following week on SmackDown, legitimate WWE Chairman Vince McMahon held a ceremony to introduce the new WWE Champion Lesnar, but was interrupted by the Undertaker and SmackDown General Manager Stephanie McMahon, who announced that Lesnar would face the Undertaker at No Mercy for the WWE Championship. On the October 9 episode of SmackDown, Lesnar defended the title against Paul London. The match was interrupted by the Undertaker, who had a meeting with Stephanie earlier that night. He announced that his match with Lesnar at No Mercy would be a Biker Chain Match rather than a standard match.|$|E

25|$|The 18th {{century was}} also a great age for the {{topographical}} print, depicting more or less accurately a real view {{in a way that}} landscape painting rarely did. Initially these were mostly centred on a building, but {{over the course of the}} century, with the growth of the Romantic movement pure landscapes became more common. The topographical print, often intended to be framed and <b>hung</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> wall, remained a very popular medium into the 20th century, but was often classed as a lower form of art than an imagined landscape.|$|E

25|$|Dhutanga (meaning austere {{practice}} Thai: Tudong) {{is a word}} generally used in the commentaries {{to refer}} to the thirteen ascetic practices. In Thai Buddhism it has been adapted to refer to extended periods of wandering in the countryside, where monks will take {{one or more of these}} ascetic practices. During these periods monks will live off of whatever is given to them by laypersons they encounter during the trip, and sleep wherever they can. Sometimes monks will bring a large umbrella-tent with attached mosquito netting known as a crot (also spelled krot, clot, or klod). The crot will usually have a hook on the top so it may be <b>hung</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> line tied between two trees.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{introduction}} of gas generally in the parish there was a limited supply from the Mill to separate houses. The Church was first lit with gas in 1857. The Public Lighting Act was adopted at a Vestry Meeting on 13 November 1862. The opposition to lamps in the streets was strong, and the effigy of an active promoter of it was carried on an ass round the village and <b>hung</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> lamp-post, and but for police interference would have been burned. In 1861 gas was supplied from Nottingham by the Nottingham Gas Light and Coke Company, and for street lamps in 1872. Beeston {{was connected to the}} mains water supply in 1876.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, baby slings and {{carriers}} {{were simply}} adaptations of whatever a culture normally {{used to carry}} anything heavy. Baskets, calabashes, animal skins, and wooden carrying structures have all been adapted to carry infants and children. Inuit mothers continue to use the packing parka or amauti to carry children. In the west, this phenomenon {{has resulted in a}} variety of carriers based on camping backpacks. One design, used in New Guinea, resembles a small Mayan-style hammock, in which an infant or child is either carried in a net on the back of an adult, or <b>hung</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> tree branch or house beam. Historical photographs of indigenous peoples show babies worn in sashes, baskets and nets hung from the parent's forehead. Cradleboards and carriers hung from one shoulder like a purse have also been documented in several cultures.|$|E

25|$|In 1578, Montaigne, whose health {{had always}} been excellent, started {{suffering}} from painful kidney stones, a sickness he had inherited from his father's family. Throughout this illness, he would {{have nothing to do}} with doctors or drugs. From 1580 to 1581, Montaigne traveled in France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Italy, partly in search of a cure, establishing himself at Bagni di Lucca where he took the waters. His journey was also a pilgrimage to the Holy House of Loreto, to which he presented a silver relief depicting himself and his wife and daughter kneeling before the Madonna, considering himself fortunate that it should be <b>hung</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> wall within the shrine. He kept a fascinating journal recording regional differences and customs and a variety of personal episodes, including the dimensions of the stones he succeeded in ejecting from his bladder. This was published much later, in 1774, after its discovery in a trunk which is displayed in his tower.|$|E

500|$|The izinDuna {{stayed in}} London {{throughout}} {{the month of}} March, attending a number of dinners in their honour, including one hosted by the Aborigines' Protection Society. The Society {{sent a letter to}} Lobengula, advising him to be [...] "wary and firm in resisting proposals that will not bring good to you and your people". The diplomats saw many of the British capital's sights, including London Zoo, the Alhambra Theatre and the Bank of England. Their hosts showed them the spear of the Zulu king Cetshwayo, which now <b>hung</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> wall at Windsor Castle, and took them to Aldershot to observe military manoeuvres conducted by Major-General Evelyn Wood, the man who had given this spear to the Queen after routing the Zulus in 1879. Knutsford held two more meetings with the izinDuna, and during the second of these gave them the Queen's reply to Lobengula's letter, which mostly comprised vague assurances of goodwill. Satisfied with this, the emissaries sailed for home.|$|E
500|$|During the High Middle Ages {{those in}} England guilty of treason were punished {{in a variety}} of ways, {{including}} drawing and hanging. [...] In the 13th century other, more brutal penalties were introduced, such as disembowelling, burning, beheading and quartering. [...] The 13th-century English chronicler Matthew Paris described how in 1238 [...] "a certain man at arms, a man of some education (armiger literatus)" [...] attempted to kill King Henry III. [...] His account records in gruesome detail how the would-be assassin was executed: [...] "dragged asunder, then beheaded, and his body divided into three parts; each part was then dragged through one of the principal cities of England, and was afterwards <b>hung</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> gibbet used for robbers." [...] He was apparently sent by William de Marisco, an outlaw who some years earlier had killed a man under royal protection before fleeing to Lundy Island. [...] De Marisco was captured in 1242 and on Henry's order dragged from Westminster to the Tower of London to be executed. [...] There he was hanged from a gibbet until dead. [...] His corpse was disembowelled, his entrails burned, his body quartered and the parts distributed to cities across the country. [...] The punishment is more frequently recorded during Edward I's reign. [...] Welshman Dafydd ap Gruffydd became the first nobleman in England to be hanged, drawn and quartered after he turned against the king and proclaimed himself Prince of Wales and Lord of Snowdon. [...] Dafydd's rebellion infuriated Edward so much that he demanded a novel punishment. [...] Therefore, following his capture and trial in 1283, for his betrayal he was drawn by horse to his place of execution. [...] For killing English nobles he was hanged alive. [...] For killing those nobles at Easter he was eviscerated and his entrails burned. [...] For conspiring to kill the king {{in various parts of the}} realm, his body was quartered and the parts sent across the country; his head was placed on top of the Tower of London. [...] A similar fate was suffered by the Scottish leader Sir William Wallace. [...] Captured and tried in 1305, he was forced to wear a crown of laurel leaves and was drawn to Smithfield, where he was hanged and beheaded. [...] His entrails were then burned and his corpse quartered. [...] His head was set on London Bridge and the quarters sent to Newcastle, Berwick, Stirling and Perth.|$|E
