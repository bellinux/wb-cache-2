5|$|BCal {{entered into}} a bid to acquire at least one Concorde. However, BCal {{eventually}} arranged for two aircraft to be leased from BA and Aérospatiale respectively, to be maintained by either BA or Air France. BCal's envisaged two-Concorde fleet would have required {{a high level of}} aircraft usage to be cost-effective; therefore, BCal had decided to operate the second aircraft on a supersonic service between Gatwick and Atlanta, with a stopover at either <b>Gander</b> or Halifax. Consideration was given to services to Houston and various points on its South American network at a later stage. Both supersonic services were to be launched at some point during 1980; however, steeply rising oil prices caused by the 1979 energy crisis led to BCal shelving their supersonic ambitions.|$|E
5|$|Monthly average temperatures, {{rainfall}} and snowfall for four communities {{are shown in}} the attached graphs. St. John's represents the east coast, <b>Gander</b> {{the interior of the}} island, Corner Brook the west coast of the island and Wabush the interior of Labrador. The detailed information and information for 73 communities in the province is available from a government website. The data used in making the graphs is the average taken over thirty years. Error bars on the temperature graph indicate the range of daytime highs and night time lows. Snowfall is the total amount which fell during the month, not the amount accumulated on the ground. This distinction is particularly important for St. John's where a heavy snowfall can be followed by rain so that no snow remains on the ground.|$|E
5|$|The Comet 4 first flew on 27 April 1958 and {{received}} its Certificate of Airworthiness on 24 September 1958; {{the first was}} delivered to BOAC the next day. The base price of a new Comet 4 was around £1,140,000, equivalent to £ in today's pounds. The Comet 4 enabled BOAC to inaugurate the first regular jet-powered transatlantic services on 4 October 1958 between London and New York (albeit still requiring a fuel stop at <b>Gander</b> International Airport, Newfoundland, on westward North Atlantic crossings). While BOAC gained publicity as the first to provide transatlantic jet service, {{by the end of}} the month rival Pan American World Airways was flying the Boeing 707 on the same route, and in 1960 the Douglas DC-8 as well. The American jets were larger, faster, longer-ranged, and more cost-effective than the Comet. After analysing route structures for the Comet, BOAC reluctantly cast about for a successor, and in 1956 entered into an agreement with Boeing to purchase the 707.|$|E

5|$|The regular {{services}} {{could be}} done with a round trip time of nine to ten days, including overnighting in Cairo, Karachi and Bangkok, and with technical revision of the plane in Hong Kong. At first there were semiweekly services, {{but by the end}} of 1947, these had increased to weekly. In June, Braathens SAFE bought a Douglas DC-3, LN-PAS Norse Carrier, and in August another DC-4, LN-PAW Norse Commander, both from KLM. In 1947, Braathens SAFE flew twenty-five trips to Hong Kong, five to New York and one to Johannesburg, South Africa, making a profit of NOK750,000. The following year, Braathens SAFE started the first trial flights to South America. The first flight was made on 23 August from Stavanger via Reykjavík, <b>Gander</b> and Bermuda to Caracas, where the plane landed on 26 August. In October, the airline flew to Panama, but neither route gave sufficient contracts to commence regular services. In 1948, the airline made fifty trips to Hong Kong, eight to Johannesburg, two to the United States, three to Venezuela and two to Panama.|$|E
5|$|Ironically, manager John Sillett {{spent much}} of the money from Coventry's FA Cup run (£750,000) on Chelsea striker David Speedie, who would replace Houchen in front of goal. Sillett's one {{consolation}} to Houchen was that he would play him in the 1987 FA Charity Shield, which ended in a 1–0 defeat to Everton. The 1987–88 season was poor for both club and player, as illness, injury and competition from Speedie, Gary Bannister and Cyrille Regis restricted Houchen to just three goals and 24 appearances. On 14 August 1988, he was selected by Graham Taylor to represent the Football League in a game against Scunthorpe United to celebrate the opening of Glanford Park; Houchen scored once in a 6–1 victory. He scored just twice in sixteen appearances in 1988–89, though one of these goals was the winner against Midlands rivals Aston Villa in a 2–1 Boxing Day victory at Highfield Road. He also featured as a substitute in the infamous 2–1 defeat to Conference club Sutton United at <b>Gander</b> Green Lane. The result was all the more remarkable considering that Coventry went on to finish seventh in the league and that Houchen was one of ten Coventry players that day who had won the FA Cup less than two years previously.|$|E
5|$|Some animals {{could also}} be {{regarded}} as dragonlike, such as rams. It was said that a rooster, a <b>gander,</b> or a turkeycock could grow a pair of little wings beneath their natural wings, thus becoming powerful dragons. A dragon rooster dug a hole beneath the threshold of his owner's house. As soon as dark clouds appeared, the rooster {{would go into the}} hole, and his spirit would fly out from his body into the clouds to fight with ale. One day the owner killed the rooster, and immediately went mad. Another dragon rooster, with two combs, would fall to the ground and lie as if dead during thunderstorms. The Aesculapian snake (smuk in Serbian and smok in Bulgarian) was regarded as a very beneficial animal. People avoided disturbing it in any way. The Aesculapian snake which inhabited a crop field or a vineyard was seen as its guardian. The snake was said to fly into the hail clouds and drive them away from its field or yard, or it dispersed the clouds by raising its head high in the air and hissing as strong as it could. In the region of Niš, the Aesculapian snakes were said to help the dragon boy in his fights against ale. If an Aesculapian snake attained a certain age, it would grow wings and become a dragon.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} how long-term feeding of <b>ganders</b> with diets containing different levels of phytoestrogens affects the morphometry of testes, plasma steroid levels, sperm parameters and reproductive performance. Male Bilgoraj geese were fed diets containing grass meal (with low phytoestrogen levels) and those containing alfalfa meal and soybean meal (with higher levels of phytoestrogens). Testes were obtained from <b>ganders</b> at the peak of mating and the ongoing laying period as well as at the beginning of photorefractoriness. The morphometric parameters were measured in frozen testicular sections. Blood was collected monthly from December to June, and plasma testosterone, androstenedione and corticosterone concentrations were determined. During the mating season, semen was collected and its quantity and quality were investigated. In the flocks (<b>ganders</b> with geese) reproductive output was noted. Seasonal changes were observed in the morphology of testes and in plasma testosterone, androstenedione and corticosterone concentrations in <b>ganders.</b> The feeding of <b>ganders</b> with dietary meals containing higher levels of phytoestrogens did not affect the plasma steroid contents or the majority of the morphometric parameters of testes, except for the height of the seminiferous epithelium, which was lowered. Moreover, diets with higher levels of phytoestrogens decreased the volume of ejaculates and the percentage of normal spermatozoa. However, these changes were not reflected in the fertilisation rates...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Experiments were {{conducted}} to compare management of <b>ganders</b> and semen collection procedures with respect to semen and sperm yield, and two frequencies of artificial insemination were tested with respect to fertility. Housing <b>ganders</b> in groups, singly, or singly {{with the introduction of}} a female just before collection was the rank order of housing system from least to most successful collection of ejaculates. There were no significant differences among types of housing with respect to semen volume, but ejaculates from <b>ganders</b> housed singly had the greatest (P< 05) spennatozoal concentrations. Ejaculates collected with an artificial vagina were of greater (P<. 05) volume and total spennatozoal yield but not spennatozoal concentration than those collected by aspiration. Interactions between collector and method were observed for spennatozoal traits. Geese inseminated on 2 consecutive days/wk showed greater (P< 01) fertility than those inseminated once per week. Therefore, collection of semen with an artificial vagina from <b>ganders</b> housed singly, with insemination weekly but on consecutive days, should result in successful reproduction of geese.
