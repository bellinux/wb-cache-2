50|$|As {{the reasons}} for these disparities are not well understood, FANCA may be a gene {{responsible}} for instigating these morphological differences when considering its variations in erythrocyte expression. In primitive and foetal erythrocyte precursors, FANCA expression is low, and almost zero during reticulocyte formation. The marginal overall increase in the <b>foetal</b> <b>stage</b> is dwarfed by its sudden increase in expression solely during adult definitive proerythroblast formation. Here, the mean expression increases by 400% compared to foetal and primitive erythrocytes, and covers a huge margin of deviation. As FANCA is heavily implicated in controlling cellular proliferation, and often results in patients developing megaloblastic anaemia around age 7, a haematological disorder marked physically by proliferation-impaired, oversized erythrocytes, {{it is possible that}} the size and proliferative discrepancies between primitive, foetal and adult erythroid lineages may be explained by FANCA expression. As FANCA is also linked to cell-cycling and its progression from G2 phase, the stage impaired in megaloblastic anaemia, its expression in definitive proerythroblast development may be an upstream determinant of erythroid size.|$|E

Conversely, the notion that yawning has a communicative function involved in the transmission of drowsiness, boredom, or mild psychological stress receives increasing support from research in different fields.

40|$|Neurons synthesizing the {{neurotransmitter}} dopamine exert crucial {{functions in}} the mammalian brain. The biggest and most important population of dopamine-synthesizing neurons {{is located in the}} mammalian ventral midbrain (VM), and controls and modulates the execution of motor, cognitive, affective, motivational, and rewarding behaviours. Degeneration of these neurons leads to motor deficits that are characteristic of Parkinsons disease, while their dysfunction is involved in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia and addiction. Because the aetiology and therapeutic prospects for these diseases include neurodevelopmental aspects, substantial scientific interest has been focused on deciphering the mechanistic pathways that control the generation and survival of these neurons during embryonic development. Researches during the last decade revealed the pivotal role of the secreted Wnt 1 ligand and its signalling cascade in the generation of the dopamine-synthesizing neurons in the mammalian VM. Here, we summarize the initial and more recent findings that have unravelled several Wnt 1 -controlled genetic networks required for the proliferation and commitment of VM progenitors to the dopaminergic cell fate during midgestational embryonic stages, and for the correct differentiation of these progenitors into postmitotic dopamine-synthesizing neurons at late midgestational embryonic and <b>foetal</b> <b>stages...</b>|$|R
40|$|The AP- 1 family {{transcription}} factor ATF 2 {{is essential for}} development and tissue maintenance in mammals. In particular, ATF 2 is highly expressed and activated {{in the brain and}} previous studies using mouse knockouts have confirmed its requirement in the cerebellum as well as in vestibular sense organs. Here we present the analysis of the requirement for ATF 2 in CNS development in mouse embryos, specifically in the brainstem. We discovered that neuron-specific inactivation of ATF 2 leads to significant loss of motoneurons of the hypoglossal, abducens and facial nuclei. While the generation of ATF 2 mutant motoneurons appears normal during early development, they undergo caspase-dependent and independent cell death during later embryonic and <b>foetal</b> <b>stages.</b> The loss of these motoneurons correlates with increased levels of stress activated MAP kinases, JNK and p 38, as well as aberrant accumulation of phosphorylated neurofilament proteins, NF-H and NF-M, known substrates for these kinases. This, together with other neuropathological phenotypes, including aberrant vacuolisation and lipid accumulation, indicates that deficiency in ATF 2 leads to neurodegeneration of subsets of somatic and visceral motoneurons of the brainstem. It also confirms that ATF 2 has a critical role in limiting the activities of stres...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the timing of foetal mortality in gilts of a segregating F 2 cross of Large White and Meishan pigs on the basis of the length distribution of mummified foetuses and the frequency of non-fresh stillborn piglets in order to establish whether critical periods for foetal mortality exist. All expelled conceptuses and placentae of 192 farrowing gilts with a normal health status were meticulously investigated to recover all mummified foetuses. The length of each mummified foetus was measured. The predicted number of foetuses present per gilt at the early <b>foetal</b> <b>stage</b> of gestation was calculated as the sum of numbers of mummified foetuses and non-fresh stillborn, fresh stillborn and liveborn piglets. Foetal loss was calculated as the sum of mummified foetuses and non-fresh stillborn piglets. The average foetal mortality rate per gilt was 8. 7 %. In total 162 mummified foetuses were found (average 0. 84 per litter), ranging in length from 0. 4 to 33. 0 cm. This indicates a range in foetal age at death of similar to 35 - 100 days. Although mummified foetuses of all lengths within the above mentioned range were found, relatively many had a length of less than 4 cm or of 10 - 21 cm. The total number of non-fresh stillborn piglets (i. e. late foetal deaths) was 58 (average 0. 30 per litter). It can be concluded that foetal mortality occurred in these gilts throughout the period from day 35 to term, with relatively high incidences at the early <b>foetal</b> <b>stage</b> (days 35 - 40), shortly after mid-pregnancy (days 55 - 75) and after similar today 100 of gestation.

40|$|The great {{decline in}} {{mortality}} {{has had a}} vital impact on our societies. Life expectancy {{has more than doubled}} in the past 200 years, but no acceptable explanation has yet been given for the earlier part of the decline in mortality, even though it has attracted a very broad interdisciplinary interest. When carefully examined, many of the stated explanations, such as better hygiene, more food, and improved medical technology, are acceptable for later stages of the general mortality decline but only the lower virulence and/or improved immunity explanation is plausible for the earlier stages. Most of the decline before 1900 was in infant and child mortality, and this study concerns child mortality during the demographic transition. Since conditions in very early life have been shown to have affected later life mortality in adult ages during this period, this study considers the possibility that child mortality in this period may also have been affected by conditions in very early life. The theoretical grounds for such effects are discussed, for example the Barker hypothesis, and it is concluded that there may be several links between conditions in very early life and health in later life; both for adults and children. A theoretical child mortality model is derived and then operationalised into an empirical model for the investigation of possible determinants of child mortality. These are current and lagged nutrition, socio-economic status, family-belonging, sex, maternal age at birth, and parish. Several links from conditions in very early life to childhood are included: <b>foetal</b> <b>stage</b> and infancy disease load, <b>foetal</b> <b>stage</b> and infancy nutrition intake, and birth season. Mortality for the age group 1 to 14 in four Scanian rural populations for the period 1766 to 1894 is analysed by means of a multivariate hazard regression model with family-based frailty. A three-period subdivision of this model accounts for enclosures, land partitionings, and industrialisation, making it possible to compare how the transition from one type of society to another affected child mortality. The empirical analysis shows that there were some differences in child mortality due to socio-economic conditions in the first sub-period (1766 - 1814), and that differences increased over time and culminated in the last sub-period (1865 - 1894). It also shows that if maternal age at birth of child was 35 or higher, the risk of mortality increased by about 30 %. Further, there was an effect of family-belonging which increased by about 70 % from the first sub-period to the second sub-period, and then remained at the same level. Both current and lagged current nutrition intakes seem to have affected child mortality. The estimates also show that conditions very early in life influenced mortality in childhood: children with a high disease load during the <b>foetal</b> <b>stage</b> and infancy experienced increased mortality risk by up to 200 %. There are few signs of an effect of constrained nutrition in early life when measured with food price, but there are nutritional effects via birth season that indicates a link between low nutrition in early life and higher mortality risk in childhood...|$|E
40|$|Whales in the {{suborder}} Mysticeti are filter feeders {{that use}} baleen to sift zooplankton and small fish from ocean waters. Adult mysticetes lack teeth, although tooth buds {{are present in}} <b>foetal</b> <b>stages.</b> Cladistic analyses suggest that functional teeth {{were lost in the}} common ancestor of crown-group Mysticeti. DNA sequences for the tooth-specific genes, ameloblastin (AMBN), enamelin (ENAM) and amelogenin (AMEL), have frameshift mutations and/or stop codons in this taxon, but none of these molecular cavities are shared by all extant mysticetes. Here, we provide the first evidence for pseudogenization of a tooth gene, enamelysin (MMP 20), in the common ancestor of living baleen whales. Specifically, pseudogenization resulted from the insertion of a CHR- 2 SINE retroposon in exon 2 of MMP 20. Genomic and palaeontological data now provide congruent support for the loss of enamel-capped teeth on the common ancestral branch of crown-group mysticetes. The new data for MMP 20 also document a polymorphic stop codon in exon 2 of the pygmy sperm whale (Kogia breviceps), which has enamel-less teeth. These results, in conjunction with the evidence for pseudogenization of MMP 20 in Hoffmann's two-toed sloth (Choloepus hoffmanni), another enamel-less species, support the hypothesis that the only unique, non-overlapping function of the MMP 20 gene is in enamel formation...|$|R

The present review summarises the knowledge on muscle fibre characteristics and ontogenesis in these species. Myofibre ontogenesis begins very early during embryonic life, with the appearance of two or three successive waves of myoblasts which constitute the origin of the different types of muscle fibres. In small animals (rodents and poultry), a primary and a secondary generation of fibres arise respectively during the embryonic and <b>foetal</b> <b>stages</b> of development. In the largest species (bovines, sheep, pigs) a third generation arises in the late foetal or early postnatal period. Following these two or three waves of myogenesis, the total number of fibres is fixed. This occurs during foetal life (bovines, ovines, pigs and poultry) or during the first postnatal month in rabbits. Contractile and metabolic differentiation proceed by steps in parallel to myogenesis and are partially linked to each other. In bovines and ovines, the main events occur during foetal life, whereas they occur soon after birth in the pig, poultry and rabbit, but some plasticity remains later in life in all species.

We and others have observed pluripotency is quite faithfully reprogrammed in NT-embryos, {{as indicated by the}} efficient derivation of embryonic stem cells from early and late NT-epiblast. Moreover, the differentiation of the epiblast in vivo is globally unaffected in NT embryos. Two critical periods have been identified during the development of clones. The high rate of lethality at the time of implantation can be partially rescued by wild type ES or ICM cells, suggesting a cell-autonomous defect in the NT epiblast. Peri-gastrulation stage is then characterized by appearance of defined morphological defects, among which an abnormal growth of the trophoblast, well correlated with the placentomegaly affecting any clones still alive at <b>foetal</b> <b>stages.</b> Trophoblast stem cells were derived from NT embryos. Remarkably, we observed that while epiblast-produced growth factors Fgf 4 and Activin exert a fine-tuned control on the balance between self-renewal and differentiation of control TS cells, as they do in vivo, ntTS cells exhibit a reduced dependency upon their micro-environment. Analysis of placental growth in chimeras made by combining tetraploid and diploid embryos suggest that placentomegaly may in fact arise from an abnormal cross-talk of the epiblast with the trophoblast...|$|R

We show that the expression of FoxO 1 is highly dynamic, starting in the neuroepithelium and then extending into the developing vasculature, including all early stages of heart formation. There is a dramatic switch of expression at 11. 5 dpc in which most vascular expression is abolished and replaced by skeletal muscle expression.

40|$|In mammals, the {{developmental}} path that links the primary behaviours observed during <b>foetal</b> <b>stages</b> {{to the full}} fledged behaviours observed in adults is still beyond our understanding. Often theories of motor control {{try to deal with}} the process of incremental learning in an abstract and modular way without establishing any correspondence with the mammalian developmental stages. In this paper, we propose a computational model that links three distinct behaviours which appear at three different stages of development. In order of appearance, these behaviours are: spontaneous motor activity (SMA), reflexes, and coordinated behaviours, such as locomotion. The goal of our model is to address in silico four hypotheses that are currently hard to verify in vivo: First, the hypothesis that spinal reflex circuits can be self-organized from the sensor and motor activity induced by SMA. Second, the hypothesis that supraspinal systems can modulate reflex circuits to achieve coordinated behaviour. Third, the hypothesis that, since SMA is observed in an organism throughout its entire lifetime, it provides a mechanism suitable to maintain the reflex circuits aligned with the musculoskeletal system, and thus adapt to changes in body morphology. And fourth, the hypothesis that by changing the modulation of the reflex circuits over time, one can switch between different coordinated behaviours. Our model is tested in a simulated musculoskeletal leg actuated by six muscles arranged {{in a number of different}} ways. Hopping is used as a case study of coordinated behaviour.

30|$|The last, and {{possibly}} the most important endpoint in toxicology, which has been investigated in screening strategies, is the toxic effects on development. It should be noted here that relatively little is unfortunately known about the modes of action involved in developmental toxicity, in comparison with many endpoints in systemic toxicity such as neurotoxicity, endocrine effects or carcinogenicity. Therefore, mode of action-based screens are not readily available. Two more holistic approaches are used to assess developmental toxicity: (1) the chick embryotoxicity screening test (CHEST) [76] and (2) the fish embryo toxicity (FET) test [77, 78]. In both assays, {{the development of a}} complete embryo is monitored and evaluated during certain embryonic and <b>foetal</b> <b>stages.</b> As such, these tests are very close to being animal studies but are not considered as such because of the very early timing of testing and the absence of a maternal organism being exposed. A third test for assessing developmental toxicity is the mouse embryonic stem cell test (EST; [79 – 81]). In this test, the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells into cardiomyocytes are evaluated, and the interference with the normal differentiation process is a measure for the compound’s developmental toxicity potential [80]. It should be noted that all of the abovementioned tests are associated with certain limitations, such as over-sensitivity for acutely toxic compounds, over-sensitivity for compounds that are irritating/corrosive, lack of metabolism, water solubility, etc. Nevertheless, with the inclusion of additional endpoints, such as placental transfer (which can be measured in vitro), reasonable prediction values can be obtained for certain classes of chemicals [82]. However, it is clear that a better understanding of AOPs in developmental toxicity will be necessary to develop a series of targeted in vitro assays to entail better screening for this very important endpoint.|$|R

Evidence suggests that the association between these and other adverse early life conditions with later health may be causal.

40|$|Schizophrenia is {{a highly}} heritable, common {{psychiatric}} disorder. Although onset generally occurs during adolescence, multiple lines of evidence point to a neurodevelopmental insult that occurs many {{years prior to the}} presentation of symptoms. Many different approaches have been used to elucidate the genetic risk factors and their impact; however, few unequivocal facts have been established. With a considerable amount of data publically available, integrative approaches look to leverage multiple data sources to identify coherent themes. This thesis investigates the neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia by incorporating results from genome-wide association studies and copy number variation studies with gene expression datasets, with the overall aim of identifying functional pathways that may be disrupted in the aetiology of the disorder. This study used foetal and developmental expression datasets of the human brain and statistical approaches to characterise the expression profiles of schizophrenia risk genes. Both spatial profiles in the mid-foetal brain and temporal profiles across development were considered. Data from genome-wide association studies and copy number variation studies were used to test for an enrichment of risk genes; in addition the genetic overlap with bipolar disorder identified through genome-wide association studies was used for validation. Gene sets with a common expression profile enriched for schizophrenia variants were used to identify biological pathways and assessed for their polygenic contribution to schizophrenia risk. The results of this thesis converged on a common developmental expression profile for schizophrenia risk genes. Genes identified with this profile were shown to harbour multiple, common risk variants for schizophrenia and were implicated in epigenetic processes relating to the regulation of gene transcription. Together this suggests that schizophrenia associated genes are involved in brain development, particularly during <b>foetal</b> <b>stages,</b> and {{may play a role in}} the regulation of this process...|$|R
40|$|Aha" {{moments of}} insight are {{considered}} fundamental to personal transformational but the phenomenology of insight and intuition are poorly understood phenomena (Levitt et ai, 2004). Life coaching {{has little to}} say on the subject since the body of literature relating to coaching is still in its <b>foetal</b> <b>stages</b> (Griffiths, 2005). This research addresses both of these problems by exploring whether "Aha" moments are fundamental to the transformational change sought by the "Co-Active" model of life coaching (Whitworth et ai, 1998, 2007). A grounded theory methodology was employed to investigate the phenomenology of insight. Participants were selected for their use of the Co-Active coaching model and their willingness to render phenomenological accounts of "Aha" moments. Co-Active coaches and their clients recorded their experiences of insight during coaching sessions. Methods involved diary-keeping, questionnaires and interviews. Diaries captured the lived experience of the "Aha" moment while questionnaires and interviews revealed its lingering effects on beliefs and behaviours. Each phase of data collection informed the next. By comparing the findings of this research with other fields of inquiry into insight, an integral methodological element was added to the grounded approach. Findings reveal the "Aha" moment to induce 'alethia' the Greek term meaning to step out of lethargy and into truth. The moment can be experienced not only cognitively but somatically and emotionally, striking many chords across a spectrum of consciousness from body, to mind, to soul to spirit. The more chords the "Aha" moment strikes, the greater the resonance and potential for cognitive and behavioural change. Findings suggest that insight comes from intuition and can arise in cognition as a purely mental event or can be experienced in transpersonal ways, where such intuition is described as 'spiritual'. The study suggests that the ontology of a truly holistic coaching model would offer the possibility of transformational change at the levels of ego, mind, body, soul and spirit.

As interneurons are generated before pyramidal cells, we have tested {{the hypothesis that}} the GABAergic interneuronal network is operative before glutamate pyramidal neurons and provides the initial patterns of activity. We patch-clamp recorded interneurons in foetal (69 neurons) and neonatal P 0 (162 neurons) hippocampal slices and performed a morphofunctional analysis of biocytin-filled neurons. At P 0, three types of interneurons were found: (i) non-innervated "silent" interneurons (5 %) with no spontaneous or evoked synaptic currents; (ii) G interneurons (17 %) with GABA(A) synapses only; and (iii) GG interneurons with GABA and glutamatergic synapses (78 %). Relying on the neuronal capacitance, cell body size and arborization of dendrites and axons, the three types of interneurons correspond to three stages of development with non-innervated neurons and interneurons with GABA(A) and glutamatergic synapses being, respectively, the least and the most developed. Recordings from both pyramidal neurons and interneurons in foetuses (E 18 - 20) revealed that the majority of interneurons (65 %) had functional synapses whereas nearly 90 % of pyramidal neurons were quiescent. Therefore, interneurons follow the same GABA-glutamate sequence of synapse formation but earlier than the principal cells.

We recently reported that these granules contain a neo-epitope that is recognised by IgM antibodies present as contaminants in many commercial antibodies obtained from mouse ascites and mouse or rabbit serum. We hypothesise that these anti-neo-epitope IgMs are in fact natural auto-antibodies that are generated spontaneously during the <b>foetal</b> <b>stage</b> without previous contact with external antigens and whose repertoire and reactivity pattern have been determined through evolution, being remarkably stable within species and even between species. Findings: In the present work we found that mice from the ICR-CD 1, BALB/C and SAMP 8 strains have anti-neoepitope IgM antibodies in their plasma at all ages tested and even when maintained under specific opportunistic pathogen-free conditions. Moreover, we determined that these anti-neo-epitope IgMs are also present in rabbit, goat and rat serum. We also found that, in each mouse that presented hippocampal granules, the anti-neo-epitope IgMs contained in its plasma recognised the neo-epitopes in its own granules. Conclusions: This study led {{to the conclusion that}} anti-neo-epitope IgMs are widespread natural auto-antibodies contained in the plasma of mice and other species. The presence of these natural auto-antibodies not only explains why they are frequently found as contaminants in commercial antibodies, but also paves the way for a new approach to a treatment and diagnosis of pathological brain processes based on natural IgMs and neo-epitopes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Pancreatic islets are {{not fully}} {{developed}} at birth {{and it is not}} clear how they are vascularised and innervated. Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) is required to guide sympathetic neurons that innervate peripheral organs and also in cardiovascular system and ovary angiogenesis. Pancreatic beta cells of a transgenic mouse that over-expressed NGF in attracts sympathetic hyper-innervation towards them. Moreover, we have previously demonstrated that adult beta cells synthesize and secrete NGF; however, we do not know how is NGF secreted during development, nor if it might be trophic for sympathetic innervation and survival in the pancreas. We analyzed sympathetic innervation and vasculature development in rat pancreatic islets at different developmental stages; foetal (F 19), early postnatal (P 1), weaning period (P 20) and adults. We temporarily correlated these events to NGF secretion by islet cells. Results Sympathetic fibres reached pancreatic islets in the early postnatal period, apparently following blood vessels. The maximal number of sympathetic fibres (TH immunopositive) in the periphery of the islets was observed at P 20, and then fibres entered the islets and reached the core where beta cells are mainly located. The number of fibres decreased from that stage to adulthood. At all stages studied, islet cells secreted NGF and also expressed the high affinity receptor TrkA. Foetal and neonatal isolated islet cells secreted more NGF than adults. TrkA receptors were expressed at all stages in pancreatic sympathetic fibres and blood vessels. These last structures were NGF–immunoreactive only at early <b>stages</b> (<b>foetal</b> and P 0). Conclusion The results suggest that NGF signalling play an important role in the guidance of blood vessels and sympathetic fibres toward the islets during <b>foetal</b> and neonatal <b>stages</b> and could also preserve innervation at later stages of life. </p...|$|R
40|$|The urea synthesizing enzymes {{of human}} liver tissues, namely, carbamylphosphate {{synthetase}} (CPS), ornithine transcarbamylase (OCT), argininosuccinic acid synthetase (ASS), argininosuccinase (ASase), arginase (Arg), have been measured between prenatal and postnatal period. Furthermore, {{the concentrations of}} protein, free amino acids of these samples were measured {{by the use of}} an automatic amino acid analyser and the relation between urea-synthesizing enzyme activities and the free amino acids was examined. Specimens from 70 autopsied human livers obtained from fetuses, premature infants, newborn infants, infants, children and adults were examined. The results were as follows : 1) The mean of activities of urea synthesizing enzymes showed a increased pattern for OCT, Arg, at foetal life, whereas those of CPS, ASS and ASase of foetal livers showed no significant difference in each stage. Except for Arg, other four enzyme activities were higher in the postnatal than those in the foetal life. Arginase activities indicated maximal increase at a gestational age between 28 - 31 weeks and decreased in the postnatal life. 2) The relative activities of the four enzymes were expressed on the basis of ASS. In the foetal life, the value of four relative activities showed significantly increased pattern, but in the postnatal life, those were constant or slightly decreased pattern. 3) The degree of urea-synthesizing enzyme activities in each stage was expressed as percent of the value measured in children. All five enzyme activities were present in 30 % or more of those of children even at a gestational age between 12 - 19 weeks. From these results, it was deduced that urea synthesized by themselves in early <b>foetal</b> <b>stages.</b> 4) There has been {{no significant difference in the}} concentrations of total protein and free amino acids between foetal and postnatal liver tissues. The ratio of essential amino acids to total free amino acids was slightly greater in the postnatal liver. 5) As concerned with a component of the free amino acids in the liver tissues, glutamine, glutamic acid, glycine and taurine accounted for 50 - 60 % of the total amino acids in the foetal livers, while, gluta-mine, glutamic acid, glycine and alanine occupied 45 - 50 % of the total amino acids postnatally. Moreover, concentrations of taurine, serine and threonine were significantly higher in the foetal tissues, whereas those of methionine and alanine were rather lower. 6) The relation between urea synthesizing enzyme activities and the free amino acids was examined. In the foetal life, urea synthesizing enzyme activities were low, however, the concentrations of free amino acids in the liver were not necessarily high. The ratios of the amino acids concerned with urea cycle substrates (aspartic acid, glutamic acid, ornithine) showed no significant difference as compared with other free amino acids. It was thought that ammonia detoxications have been done sufficiently with those low enzyme activities...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of hunger or thirst {{in response to}} expanded periods of food or water deprivation is a basic feature of motivated ingestive behavior. If {{we want to have}} a complete understanding of thirst, we need to understanddifferent phenomena: how the brain of the animals or humans creates the urge to drink water, how it generates an anticipation of water, how it emits the behaviors that lead an animal to water and allow it to be selected from among other ingestible commodities, how it makes thirst and water drinking inherently reinforcing and memorable. The particular {{development of}} dipsogenic and additional regulatory mechanisms for the control of hydrosaline homeostasis through ingestive behavior occurs during <b>foetal</b> and early <b>stages</b> of life and may be susceptible to changes in the pregnant environment (Ross & Nijland, 1998).

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{doctoral}} thesis is {{to contribute to the}} debate on the importance of diet and disease in explaining the mortality decline and the general literature of the long-term effects of early life conditions. Using individual-level data from Southern Sweden for 1813 to 1968, this work measures the impacts of grain prices during the <b>foetal</b> <b>stage</b> and infant mortality rates during the year of birth on mortality over the full life course, as well as on female socioeconomic status attainment and reproductive health. Specific exposure to measles, scarlet fever and whooping cough are also considered. Regarding the impact of prices, higher mortality is observed among exposed landless males in old age, while exposed landless females exhibit lower probabilities of dying in adulthood and old age and experience no significant effects on their socioeconomic status attainment and reproductive health. Regarding the impact of disease, sex-specific effects on mortality are observed in adult ages for those born in years with measles and scarlet fever. However, the effect of exposure to whooping cough on mortality is strong and uniform across individuals of different sexes and socioeconomic status. Females exposed to this disease are also less able to attain high socioeconomic status in adulthood and experience worse reproductive health, providing evidence of transfers across generations. This thesis finds that disease has a more important role than diet in determining the length and quality of life...|$|E
40|$|We {{previously}} {{demonstrated that}} the liver may be a major site of extrathymic T-cell differentiation in mice. In the present study, the ontogeny and subsequent development of such T cells in the liver and other organs were investigated. This study was possible because these T cells have T-cell receptors (TcR) of intermediate intensity (i. e. intermediate TcR cells) and constitutively express {{a high level of}} interleukin- 2 receptor beta chain (IL- 2 R beta). Therefore the two-colour staining for CD 3 (or alpha beta TcR) and IL- 2 R beta identifies even a small proportion of intermediate TcR cells. The total numbers of mononuclear cells obtained from the liver, thymus and spleen varied from foetal to adult life. Especially in the liver, many haematopoietic cells were present in the parenchymal space at the <b>foetal</b> <b>stage.</b> There were no lymphocytes in the sinusoidal lumen at this period. In contrast, lymphocytes appeared in the hepatic sinusoids after birth and increased with ageing. Phenotypic analysis revealed that intermediate TcR cells appeared in the liver and spleen on Day 4 after birth. Bright TcR cells of thymic origin were also present in the peripheral organs on Day 4. Thereafter, intermediate TcR cells increased in the liver, whereas bright TcR cells increased in the periphery as a function of age. Similarly, thymectomized and congenitally athymic mice had mainly intermediate TcR cells in the liver and, to some extent, periphery. It is concluded that intermediate TcR cells, possibly of extrathymic origin, are generated only after birth and expand with ageing...|$|E
40|$|Somitogenesis in {{the mouse}} embryo commences with the {{generation}} of presumptive somitic mesoderm at the primitive streak and in the tail-bud mesenchyme. The presumptive somitic mesoderm is then organized into somite primordia in the presomitic mesoderm. These primordia undergo morphogenesis leading to the segmentation of somites at the cranial end of the presomitic mesoderm. Somite sizes {{at the time of}} segmentation vary according to the position of the somite in the body axis: the size of lumbar and sacral somites is nearly twice that of upper trunk somites and of tail somites. The size of the presomitic mesoderm, which is governed by the balance between the addition of cells at the caudal end and the removal of somites at the cranial end, changes during embryonic development. Somitogenesis is disturbed during the compensatory growth of mouse embryos which have suffered a drastic size reduction at the primitive-streak and early-organogenesis stages. The formation of somites is retarded and the upper trunk somites are formed at a smaller size. The embryo also follows an entirely different growth profile, but a normal body size is restored by the early <b>foetal</b> <b>stage.</b> The somite number is regulated to normal " and this is brought about by an altered rate of somite formation and the adjustment of somite size in proportion to the whole body size. It is proposed that axis formation and somitogenesis are related morphogenetic processes and that embryonic growth controls the kinetics of somito genesis, namely by regulating the number of cells allocated to each somite and the rate of somite formation...|$|E
40|$|Description of in vivo bovine myogenesis using proteomic {{approach}} gives {{new insights}} for muscle development (Die Proteomanalyse der In-vivo-Myogenese beim Rind liefert neue Einsichten in die Muskelentwicklung) Bovine myogenesis {{can be characterized}} by five key <b>stages</b> during the <b>foetal</b> life.

The last third of bovine foetal life, encompassing 210 dpc and 260 dpc, is mainly characterised by a large metabolic and contractile differentiation step. If histological and biochemical experiments allowed the analysis of bovine myogenesis and allowed to display those stages, many questions remain about the proteomic mechanisms involved in the regulation of the: i) proliferation of the two myoblasts generations, ii) cellular transition proliferation/cellular alignment/fusion of the myoblasts in myotubes/ differentiation...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} and regeneration of skeletal muscle is fuelled by muscle stem/progenitor cell biogenesis. The ability of these cells {{to survive and}} contribute to muscle growth and regeneration is dependent on master regulator genes, Pax 3 and Pax 7. These genes control key aspects of cell behaviour by their regulation of, and interactions with, other genes and proteins. Exactly how the Pax 7 protein recognises and regulates specific genes to effect appropriate muscle progenitor behaviour is not fully understood. However as for other Pax genes, which similarly regulate the {{development and}} maintenance of different tissue lineages, {{this is likely to}} be linked to the production of multiple splice forms. Surprisingly little is known about 1) the contribution of Pax 7 at the later, <b>foetal,</b> <b>stages</b> of muscle development and, 2) Pax 7 splice forms to the regulation of muscle stem cell biogenesis in both developing and adult muscles. This gap in knowledge was the impetus for this PhD research. As the roles of many Pax genes are specific to the stage of cell biogenesis as well as the status of the tissue in which the cell is found, an in vivo approach was taken to characterise the natural history of Pax 7 transcript expression and investigate the relationship of Pax 7 with the powerful myogenic inducer, MyoD. Using mouse models of development and muscle maintenance and regeneration, this work suggests that the functional diversity of Pax 7 in normal foetal and adult myogenesis in vivo is due to a factor other than changes in the relative proportions of alternate paired box transcripts. A second key finding of this work was the demonstrated expression of an alternate transcript, Pax 7 A, in the early mouse embryo as well as foetal muscle and brain, arising from proximal polyadenylation and splicing. Dynamic expression during foetal myogenesis suggests this mechanism may be functionally important during this time. Computational analyses predicted that Pax 7 A lacks miRNA control elements in the 3 ’UTR, leading to the hypothesis that changes in the ratios of Pax 7 A to Pax 7 B could affect the known reciprocal inhibition between Pax 7 and MyoD. Endogenous levels of Pax 7 and MyoD proteins were investigated to explore the spatio-temporal contribution of Pax 7 to foetal limb myogenesis. This work showed that Pax 7 and MyoD are co-expressed in foetal limb muscles and that the Pax 7 and MyoD expression profile is highly likely {{to play a role in}} myogenic progression of foetal precursors in vivo, as reported for adult satellite cells. Further, temporal expression patterns suggest that MyoD protein can be downregulated in Pax 7 precursors in foetal muscles. This could be related to the specification of satellite cells to the sublaminar position that occurs under the guidance of Notch, which is known to inhibit MyoD-mediated differentiation. It could be important that these cells do not differentiate during this time. Lastly, to investigate if Pax 3 cells may also regulate muscle progenitor biogenesis during normal foetal myogenesis, spatio-temporal expression of endogenous Pax 3 protein in situ was qualitatively analysed. Whilst Pax 3 is mostly absent, a novel finding is that endogenous Pax 3 protein may be re-expressed in some foetal limb muscles. In conclusion, this thesis reveals new insights into the contributions of Pax 7 and its transcripts to adult and foetal myogenesis in vivo, particularly of the foetal limb...|$|R
