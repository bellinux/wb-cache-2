40|$|In {{this work}} the {{differences}} between the thermodynamic behaviour of real and ideal gases are analysed to determine their influence on the processes of compression and expansion of a <b>gas-charged</b> <b>accumulator.</b> The behaviour of real gas has a significant influence on the size of accumulators used for Kinetic Energy Recovery of vehicles. In particular, it is underscored that the accumulator's design, based on ideal gas behaviour, provides undersized accumulators and therefore makes impossible the complete energy recovery for Hydraulic Energy Storage Systems (HES). The analysis of the thermodynamic properties of gases has shown that the main differences between ideal and real behaviour are due to gas compressibility. A mathematical model of a <b>gas-charged</b> <b>accumulator</b> is developed in order to analyse its real behaviour in presence of irreversible heat transfer and viscous losses. The simulation process of charging and discharging of a hydro-pneumatic accumulator, makes it clear that hydrodynamic and thermal losses are responsible for the characteristic hysteresis cycle on the p-V diagram. Different gases are tested as charged fluid of a hydro-pneumatic accumulator to simulate cyclic processes of charge and discharge. Results show different characteristics in terms of volumetric gas properties, thermal time-constant and thermal efficiency of the accumulator. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

A new technical {{scheme of}} vehicle with electronic control and hydrostatic drive (ECHD) is {{proposed in the}} paper. To make out the drive/brake features of the vehicle, a model, combined with the vehicle dynamics and hydrostatic transmission dynamics, and the corresponding simulation program is developed, in which, a <b>gas-charged</b> <b>accumulator</b> is used as power source and energy storage component. In this paper, three main misuses are investigated, i. e. the energy recover and consumption of hydrostatic transmission when drive/brake, vehicle dynamics parameters in drive/brake and how the key components, hydraulic variable motor and accumulator, contributing to the performance.

40|$|Recoverable {{energy in}} vehicle {{suspension}} systems has attracted intensive attention {{in recent years}} {{for the improvement of}} vibration suppression performance and the reduction of energy dissipation. Various design concepts and structures of regenerative suspensions have been presented and investigated to recover the energy of linear motion and vibration between the vehicle body and chassis from road disturbances. These studies concentrate on the energy conversion from kinetic energy to electricity. Although a large number of concepts and models have been proposed and evaluated to regenerate power for reuse, the previous simulation works have used significantly simplified models without considering parameter uncertainties and system losses. In addition, experimental works are too simple to support for modelling optimisation. To advance the technology, a regenerative hydraulic shock absorber is investigated rigorously by examining the system at various developing stages including modelling all hydraulic, mechanical, and electromagnetic processes, simulating its behaviours, identifying its uncertain parameters/variables, fabricating a prototype of a commonly used shock absorber, testing its desirable performance and evaluating its on-road usability, which has given an accurate understanding of dynamic behaviours and power regeneration of a regenerative hydraulic shock absorber system. Based on the configuration of the prototype, a comprehensive mathematical model is developed for the regenerative hydraulic shock absorber system. The various losses and nonlinearity have been taken into account in modelling hydraulic, mechanical, and electromagnetic processes, which allow more detailed influences and agreeable predictions with the experimental work to be obtained. The introduction of the <b>gas-charged</b> hydraulic <b>accumulator</b> into the system has been explored in both modelling and testing to provide power smoothing in an attempt to give a more stable recoverable power. Model parameter identifications and refinements based on online data are systemically investigated. It has found that the pressures, rotation speeds and electrical outputs, which are readily available in the system, are sufficient to determine and refine uncertain model parameters such as the voltage constant coefficient, torque constant coefficient, generator internal resistance and rotational friction torque using a common least square method. The developed experimental rig and measurement systems for the study of regenerative hydraulic shock absorbers are designed and built. The variations in motor pressure and shaft speed under different excitations are evaluated, and also voltage output and recoverable power at different electrical loads are investigated. Additionally, the experimental work is not only used to validate the predicted results comprehensively, but also to offer a practical evaluation method for the system under various operating conditions. In particular, the system using piston-rod dimensions of 50 - 30 mm achieves recoverable power of 260 W with an efficiency of around 40...|$|R

This paper presents the performance studies of modelling and testing for a hydraulic regenerative {{shock absorber}} system with different sizes of <b>gas-charged</b> <b>accumulator</b> {{in order to improve}} the stability of hydraulic behaviour and power regeneration. The model is proposed to stabilize hydraulic flow with variable accumulator capacity with the impressive power regeneration efficiency which is almost constant, and obtained agreeable results between predicted and measured in sinusoidal oscillation.
