Equipped with a 90-millimetre searchlight, the emplacement was situated {{at the bottom of the}} garden, overlooking Portland Harbour, and formed part of the Nothe Fort defences. It would have been constructed between 1940-41, using concrete. The emplacement continued to remain in the gardens throughout the 20th-century, until 1988 when land slippage within that area of the gardens destroyed the structure.|$|E
50|$|The pages used {{in books}} {{from this period}} also pose their own concerns. There were three main {{materials}} used for the pages of books in this time period: papyrus, parchment or vellum, and paper (Alexander 35). Papyrus was the primary writing material of the ancient world, and was created by beating stalks of the papyrus reed together until the fibers in the plant formed a tight, almost woven structure. Because it did not provide a stable surface for paint, this sort of paper was very rarely used for illuminated manuscripts. As for the paper most people would recognize today, the first true example was created in China around 105 A.D. using beaten, strained, and dried vegetable fibers such as tree bark. However, this paper was very expensive and generally had to be imported {{at the time that}} illuminated manuscripts were being widely made, so it appears less often than the third alternative, parchment (Permanence/Durability of the Book 11). It is worth noting that those manuscripts with paper pages are much harder to conserve, and the acids present in the plant fibers naturally cause it to yellow and break down over time. This process is irreversible, but can be slowed and limited by controlling the temperature, humidity, and light exposure of the paper. Turning to the final option, we reach {{the most common form of}} page used in illuminated manuscripts. Parchment and vellum are both made of very fine, prepared and treated animal skins that have been dried in a manner which leaves them flexible. The difference between them is that vellum is usually made with either goat, pig, or calf skin, while parchment is made from sheep skin (Langwell 44). Parchment provides an ideal surface for illumination, and was even placed into books which used other page materials in patches to allow for a good painting or <b>illuminating</b> <b>surface</b> (Alexander 35). This prevalent use of parchment provides some of the historical significance of illuminated manuscripts. The different kinds of hide used can be DNA tested with modern equipment, and often tell historians what area the book is from and sometimes where the hide was sourced from, mapping trade routes and patterns otherwise lost to history. There is one key conservation problem with parchment and vellum that was discovered even while it was being widely used: if is very susceptible to water damage. Not only does it mold quickly in high humidity environments, but early forms of ink that were commonly used on papyrus could simply be washed off without leaving a trace. It is believed that “Iron gall inks were devised to overcome this disadvantage,” however even these inks can be wiped off fairly thoroughly if they are scrubbed (Langwell 43).|$|E
40|$|A new {{technique}} for interactive vector field visualization using {{large numbers of}} properly illuminated stream lines is presented. Taking into account ambient, diffuse, and specular reflection terms as well as transparency, we employ a realistic shading model which significantly increases quality and realism of the resulting images. While many graphics workstations offer hardware support for <b>illuminating</b> <b>surface</b> primitives, usually no means for an accurate shading of line primitives are provided. However, we show that proper illumination of lines can be implemented by exploiting the texture mapping capabilities of modern graphics hardware. In this way high rendering performance with interactive frame rates can be achieved. We apply the technique to render large numbers of integral curves in a vector field. The impression of the resulting images can be further improved by making the curves partially transparent. We also describe methods for controlling the distribution of stream lines in space. These methods enable us to use illuminated stream lines within an interactive visualization environment. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this work is an {{acquisition}} of lighting- and material-characterization for an interactive environment simulation. It is planned, that the lighting acquisition data is based upon real data allocated from light manufacturers (Eulumdat-Formate/IES-Formate). The data has to be converted into an adapted form (textures) {{that can be used}} within the rendering system. The acquisition of the material-characterization is planned to be based upon photographs from real materials. Thereby have to be taken pictures in different lighting situations. That picture-sequence needs to be converted into an adapted form (3 d-textures) that can be used within the rendering system. The acquisition and postprocessing steps should be automated if possible. The Fraunhofer Institut für Graphische Datenverarbeitung (IGD) develops a software system that allows interactive light simulation. Interactive movement of scene objects and highly realistic simulation in real-time should be displayed. The purpose is to generate images, not to visualize numeric values of luminance intensity onto a raster, which is not intuitive for the user. A photorealistic image to work with is highly appreciated. A method to generate high quality images in real-time is PRT (Precomputed Radiance Transfer). The advantage of PRT to other real-time rendering methods as OpenGL is the simulation of soft shadows in real-time because of flat, homogenously <b>illuminating</b> <b>surface</b> light sources. Precomputed Shadow Fields [11] extends PRT with dynamic objects and local light sources. Diffused illumination in dynamic scenes is not possible though. The system that is used and further developed by the IGD extends the Shadow Fields with diffused illumination. The specific of the new system shall be the utilization of dynamic PRT for light-designers. Therefore analogous input data is essential to accomplish the light simulation. To allocate physically based data is the purpose of this project...|$|E
