40|$|Group {{exercise}} {{training programs}} were introduced {{as a strategy}} for improving health and fitness and potentially reducing dropout rates. This study examined the psychophysiological responses to <b>group</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>training</b> <b>sessions.</b> Twenty-seven adults completed two <b>group</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>training</b> <b>sessions</b> of moderate and vigorous exercise intensities in a random and counterbalanced order. The %HRR and the exertional and arousal responses to vigorous session were higher than those during the moderate session (p< 0. 05). Consequently, the affective responses to vigorous session were less pleasant than those during moderate session (p< 0. 05). These {{results suggest that the}} psychophysiological responses to <b>group</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>training</b> <b>sessions</b> are intensity-dependent. From an adherence perspective, interventionists are encouraged to emphasize <b>group</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>training</b> <b>sessions</b> at a moderate intensity to maximize affective responses and to minimize exertional responses, which in turn may positively affect future exercise behavior...|$|E
40|$|Objective:To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} a six-week exercise intervention on gross motor function for non-ambulant children with cerebral palsy. Design:A parallel arm randomized controlled trial. Setting:Four special schools. Participants:Thirty-five children aged 8 - 17 with bilateral cerebral palsy; Gross Motor Function Classification System levels IV-V. Method:Participants were randomly allocated to a static bike group, a treadmill group or control group. Participants in the bike and treadmill <b>groups</b> received <b>exercise</b> <b>training</b> <b>sessions,</b> three times weekly for six weeks. The control group received their usual care. Blinded assessments were performed at baseline and six weeks and followed up at 12 and 18 weeks. Outcome measures:Gross Motor Function Measures GMFM- 66, GMFM- 88 D and GMFM- 88 E. Results:At six weeks significant differences were found in GMFM- 88 D scores between the bike group and the control group, and the treadmill group and the control group (P < 0. 05). The mean change (SD) in GMFM- 88 D score was 5. 9 (6. 8) for the bike group; 3. 7 (4. 4) for the treadmill group and 0. 5 (1. 9) for the control group. No significant differences were found for GMFM- 66 or GMFM- 88 E scores between the bike group and control group, or the treadmill group and control group, although trends of improvement were observed for both <b>exercise</b> <b>groups.</b> The improvements observed declined during the follow-up period. Conclusion:This study provides preliminary evidence that exercising on a bike or treadmill may provide short-term improvements in gross motor function for non-ambulant children with cerebral palsy.

The hypothesis of this study was that the program would yield a 5 % to 7 % weight loss among participants, thereby reducing or delaying their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 58 %. Eligibility requirements were age 18 - 80 years, BMI ??? 30 kg/m??, and a score of ??? 5 on the NDEP Diabetes Risk Test. The independent variables of this study included: resistance training, moderate intensity aerobic training, and the DPP curriculum. The dependent variable in this study was weight. As with the original research, weight is the primary marker of success relative to reduction of diabetes risk. The protocol was modified from the National DPP curriculum available on the Internet. The 16 sessions were condensed and modified to 10 minute lectures delivered at the end of the 34 sessions over the 12 -week period. Some example topics ranged from healthier dietary choices, positive thinking, and basic lifestyle modifications. Greater emphasis was placed on physical activity by having the participants engage in structured <b>group</b> <b>exercise</b> circuit <b>training</b> <b>sessions</b> for the first 50 minutes of each session. Each exercise session was completed at a moderate intensity and accommodated to the physical fitness capabilities of each participant. The dietary guidelines were consistent with the National DPP and participants were encouraged to stay within their weekly calorie targets which are based on their initial body weight. Participants were also instructed to monitor their dietary intake and physical activity in ???tracker??? logs. Feedback was given as warranted. There were 7 participants who completed the required program.

METHODS Sixty-seven patients (33 to 82 years old) with moderate to severe intermittent claudication were recruited, and the maximum power generated during incremental upper- and lower-limb ergometry tests was determined, as were pain-free and maximum walking distances (by using a shuttle walk test). Patients {{were randomly assigned to}} an upper-limb training group (n = 26) or a lower-limb training group (n = 26). An additional untrained group (n = 15) was recruited on an ad hoc basis in parallel with the main trial by using identical inclusion criteria. This group was subsequently shown to possess a similar demographic distribution to the two <b>exercise</b> <b>groups.</b> Supervised <b>training</b> <b>sessions</b> were held twice weekly for 6 weeks.

Methods Patients who received percutaneous coronary intervention due to acute coronary syndrome were included. The patients who participated in cardiac rehabilitation (CR) program were categorized as the CR group, and others who did not participate as the control. Both groups underwent initial graded exercise test (GXT) and FMD testing. Subsequently, the CR <b>group</b> performed aerobic <b>exercise</b> <b>training</b> <b>sessions.</b> Patients in control only received advice regarding the exercise methods. After six weeks, both groups received follow-up GXT and FMD testing. Results There were 16 patients in each group.

The VO 2 peak was 28. 6 ± 4. 7 mL/kg/min in the CR group and 31. 5 ± 7. 4 mL/kg/min in the control at first GXT, and was 31. 1 ± 5. 1 ml/kg/min in the CR group and 31. 4 ± 6. 0 ml/kg/min in the control at the follow-up GXT in six weeks. There was a statistically significant improvement in VO 2 peak only for CR group patients.

40|$|SummaryExercise {{training}} {{performed in}} cardiac rehabilitation centres is an adjuvant therapy in chronic heart failure patients with left ventricular dysfunction; it decreases the deleterious consequences of chronic heart failure. <b>Exercise</b> <b>training</b> attenuates neurohormonal stimulation, {{the production of}} proinflammatory cytokines and natriuretic peptide overexpression. Trained patients showed {{a significant decrease in}} the peripheral organ injuries encountered in chronic heart failure, with a reduction in vascular resistance and improvements in endothelial dysfunction and the oxidative capacity of peripheral muscles, without a deleterious effect on left ventricular remodelling. Ultimately, <b>exercise</b> <b>training</b> leads to a notable improvement in ventilatory capacity. These beneficial effects are accompanied by improvements in symptoms at rest, exercise capacity and quality of life. Several training programmes are in current use: <b>exercise</b> <b>training</b> <b>sessions</b> always include endurance exercise performed either at a constant load intensity or with interval training, combining periods of exercise performed at high intensity with periods performed at low intensity. Most of the time, training programmes also include resistance <b>training</b> <b>sessions,</b> which improves large muscle strength. <b>Exercise</b> <b>training</b> programmes seem to have a favourable effect on prognosis, even if the results of Heart Failure: a Controlled Trial Investigating Outcomes of <b>Exercise</b> <b>Training</b> (HF-ACTION) remain controversial, emphasizing the difficulty in monitoring observance and the importance of compliance with a long-term <b>exercise</b> <b>training</b> programme.

40|$|Regular <b>exercise</b> <b>training</b> confers {{beneficial}} effects {{to the heart}} {{as well as to}} the entire body. This occurs partly because <b>exercise</b> <b>training</b> improves skeletal muscle work capacity and reduces resistance, thus increasing conductance in the peripheral circulation. More directly, <b>exercise</b> <b>training</b> also alters extrinsic modulation of the heart and improves the intrinsic pump capacity of the heart. Together, these effects allow for improved exercise capacity. Accumulating evidence suggests that the magnitude of these benefits increases proportionally with the intensity of individual <b>exercise</b> <b>training</b> <b>sessions</b> constituting the <b>exercise</b> <b>training</b> program. It has emerged that regular <b>exercise</b> <b>training</b> also confers {{beneficial effects}} to patients at risk for, or who have, established heart dysfunction and disease and, moreover, that <b>exercise</b> <b>training</b> may reduce the dysfunction of the heart itself and, at least, partly restore its ability to effectively function as a pump. The most recent studies in patients with established heart disease suggest that a high relative, yet aerobic, intensity of the <b>exercise</b> <b>training</b> improves the intrinsic pump capacity of the myocardium, an effect not previously believed to occur with <b>exercise</b> <b>training.</b> However, more and larger studies are needed to establish the safety and efficacy of such <b>exercise</b> <b>training</b> in patients with heart disease.

Finally, data were analyzed by Stata software. Results: Statistical data analysis illustrated that the amounts of irisin serum were significantly increased in <b>exercise</b> <b>training</b> <b>group</b> than control group (14. 75 ± 6. 22; p= 0. 022) after the intervention. Also, only body fat percentage (1. 242 ± 0. 57) and max oxygen consumption (1. 509 ± 0. 328) of subjects were significantly increased (p= 0. 034 and p= 0. 0001, respectively). However, there were not statistically significant changes in irisin- related insulin-resistance indices (p> 0. 05). Conclusion: Current study presented that serum irisin was increased after 30 submaximal <b>exercise</b> <b>training</b> <b>sessions</b> regardless of insulin resistance changes in obese men. ...|$|R

30|$|By {{considering}} alternative evidence-based {{models of}} <b>exercise</b> <b>training,</b> and offering flexible program design {{in order to}} increase ongoing adherence to exercise, programs may also attract an increased number of participants to their service. While a lack of referral is often cited as a significant barrier to the uptake of cardiac rehabilitation, other well-known barriers include issues with the program itself such as <b>exercise</b> <b>training</b> location, <b>session</b> availability or the frequency and duration of attendance required [133, 136]. Knowledge that program design can be flexible, without greatly impacting on the clinical outcomes expected, may help to reassure clinicians when prescribing <b>exercise</b> <b>training.</b> Additionally, flexibility in design may overcome the resourcing issues faced by many programs in the current economic climate [137].|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effects of high fat diet and endurance training on rat adipose tissue. Male Wistar rats were assigned to either a low or high fat diet (12 % and 73 % calories as fat, respectively). Both groups were further divided into sedentary (LFS;n= 11 and HFS;n= 11) and <b>exercise</b> <b>trained</b> (LFT;n= 11 and HFT;n= 11) <b>groups.</b> <b>Exercise</b> <b>training</b> was 5 wk swimming program in which duration of swimming was gradually increased to 5 h/day. Epididymal fat pad weight and adipose cell size in HFS group were significantly (P< 0. 001) higher than in LFS group. Endurance training was associated with a lower body weight and fat pad weight in both diet groups. The high fat diet decreased lipolysis stimulated by maximum norepinephrine in both untrained and trained groups (～ 48 and ～ 38 %, respectively). Endurance training increased the lipolysis in both low and high fat diet groups (～ 41 % and ～ 96 %, respectively). These results suggest that obesity and lipemia induced by the high fat diet might be improved by endurance training...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Regular {{physical}} activity may improve {{different aspects of}} wellbeing in older people, such as quality of life, vitality and depression. However, there is little experimental evidence to support this assumption. Therefore, we examined the effect of different training protocols on quality of life, vitality and depression of older adults living in long-term care facilities. Methods Subjects (n = 173, aged 64 to 94 years, living in long-term care facilities), were randomized to six months of three different moderate-intensity <b>group</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>training</b> protocols, or to an 'educational' control condition. Exercise consisted of two 45 – 60 -minute <b>training</b> <b>sessions</b> per week of 1) resistance training; 2) all-round, functional training; or 3) a combination of both. Perceived health, the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), the Vitality Plus Scale (VPS) and the Dementia Quality of Life questionnaire (DQoL) were administered at baseline and after six months. Results In the combined training group a small but significant decline was seen in perceived health, DQoL and VPS score compared to the control group. Conclusions We conclude that neither strength training nor all-round, functional training of moderate intensity is effective in improving quality of life, vitality or depression of older people living in long-term care facilities. </p...|$|R
40|$|Aims MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are the {{targeting}} signal-transduction pathways that can mediate tumorigenesis via their down and/or up-regulation. For example, miR- 21 and miR- 206 can {{effect on the}} tumor angiogenesis as an oncomir and a tumor suppressor, respectively. Materials and methods The present study is aimed to investigate {{the effects of the}} interval <b>exercise</b> <b>training</b> in combination with tamoxifen and/or letrozole on miR- 21, miR- 206 and let- 7 as well as their underlying pathways in regard to tumor angiogenesis in sixty four mice with breast tumor. ELISA, immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR assays were performed accomplish the study. Key findings The results showed that the tumor size was significantly declined in the <b>exercise</b> <b>training,</b> tamoxifen and letrozole groups compared to tumor group. Mir- 206 and let- 7 were up-regulated, and mir- 21 expression was down-regulated in the <b>exercise</b> <b>training</b> compared to tumor <b>group.</b> <b>Exercise</b> <b>training</b> decreased the expression of ER-α, HIF-α, VEGF, CD 31 and Ki 67 in tumor tissue. The combination tamoxifen and/or letrozole with the <b>exercise</b> <b>training</b> could down-regulate the expression of ERα, miR- 21, HIF- 1 α, TNF-α, CD 31, Ki 67 and VEGF, and up-regulate the expression of miR- 206, PDCD- 4, let- 7 and IL- 10 that led to reducing the angiogenesis and tumor growth. Significance Our results showed that miR- 21, miR- 206 and let- 7 a pathways may involve in the anti-angiogenesis effects of the interval <b>exercise</b> <b>training</b> with hormone therapy in mice model of breast tumor. © 2016 Elsevier Inc...|$|R
40|$|Background/Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess whether a program of {{exercise}} specifically designed to target the vestibular organ improved the postural stability of female participants over 60 years old. Methods: Twenty-eight healthy female volunteers aged from 60 years to 76 years were assigned to a group (n =  15) engaging in vestibular-stimulating exercises, or to a control group (n =  13) engaging in traditional <b>training</b> <b>exercises.</b> <b>Training</b> <b>sessions</b> (∼ 45 minutes each) occurred twice a week over the course of 3 months. The following parameters were analyzed before and after training for both groups: stabilogram ellipse area and radii, total length of stabilogram, and visual-inspection indicator (eyes open). Results: Results in terms of stabilogram ellipse area and radius without visual control (eyes closed) revealed statistically significant differences in the experimental group between the values before and after the training regimen (74. 8  ±  51. 6  −  54. 5  ±  42. 5 for area of ellipse, 6. 6  ±  2. 8  −  5. 8  ±  2. 8 for axis minor, 13. 2  ±  4. 3  −  11. 1  ±  3. 3 for axis major, respectively).

This study evaluated the effects of elliptical exercise on fatigue and QOL reports in patients with MS. Patients with MS (n = 26) completed the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), and the Medical Outcomes Study 36 -Item Short Form Health Survey (SF- 36) before and after completing 15 elliptical <b>exercise</b> <b>training</b> <b>sessions.</b> Changes in fatigue and QOL were assessed based on any changes in the fatigue and SF- 36 questionnaires, and correlations between changes {{in each of the}} scales were made to determine whether a relationship was present between the fatigue and QOL measures. Results showed significant improvement in FSS, MFIS, and five SF- 36 subscales as a result of elliptical exercise. The change in FSS correlated with change in two of the SF- 36 subscales. Elliptical exercise for patients with MS results in significant improvements in both fatigue and QOL. These findings indicate that regular elliptical exercise could be a part of inpatient and outpatient MS rehabilitation programs...|$|R
