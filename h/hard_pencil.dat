60|$|The quill nibs {{they sell}} {{to fit into}} {{ordinary}} pen-holders are no true quills at all, lacking dignity, and may even lead you into the New Humour if you trust overmuch to their use. After a proper quill commend me to a stumpy BB pencil; you get less polish and broader effects, but you are still doing good literature. Sometimes the work is close--Mr. George Meredith, for instance, is suspected of a soft pencil--and always it is blunter than quill work and more terse. With a <b>hard</b> <b>pencil</b> no man can write anything but a graceless style--a kind of east wind air it gives--and smile you cannot. So that it is often used for serious articles in the half-crown reviews.|$|E
60|$|I am wont {{to think}} that men {{are not so much}} the keepers of herds as herds are the keepers of men, the former are so much the freer. Men and oxen {{exchange}} work; but if we consider necessary work only, the oxen will be seen to have greatly the advantage, their farm is so much the larger. Man does some of his part of the exchange work in his six weeks of haying, and it is no boy's play. Certainly no nation that lived simply in all respects, that is, no nation of philosophers, would commit so great a blunder as to use the labor of animals. True, there never was and is not likely soon to be a nation of philosophers, nor am I certain it is desirable that there should be. However, I should never have broken a horse or bull and taken him to board for any work he might do for me, for fear I should become a horseman or a herdsman merely; and if society seems to be the gainer by so doing, are we certain that what is one man's gain is not another's loss, and that the stable-boy has equal cause with his master to be satisfied? Granted that some public works would not have been constructed without this aid, and let man share the glory of such with the ox and horse; does it follow that he could not have accomplished works yet more worthy of himself in that case? When men begin to do, not merely unnecessary or artistic, but luxurious and idle work, with their assistance, it is inevitable that a few do all the exchange work with the oxen, or, in other words, become the slaves of the strongest. Man thus not only works for the animal within him, but, for a symbol of this, he works for the animal without him. Though we have many substantial houses of brick or stone, the prosperity of the farmer is still measured by {{the degree to which the}} barn overshadows the house. This town is said to have the largest houses for oxen, cows, and horses hereabouts, and it is not behindhand in its public buildings; but there are very few halls for free worship or free speech in this county. It should not be by their architecture, but why not even by their power of abstract thought, that nations should seek to commemorate themselves? How much more admirable the Bhagvat-Geeta than all the ruins of the East! Towers and temples are the luxury of princes. A simple and independent mind does not toil at the bidding of any prince. Genius is not a retainer to any emperor, nor is its material silver, or gold, or marble, except to a trifling extent. To what end, pray, is so much stone hammered? In Arcadia, when I was there, I did not see any hammering stone. Nations are possessed with an insane ambition to perpetuate the memory of themselves by the amount of hammered stone they leave. What if equal pains were taken to smooth and polish their manners? One piece of good sense would be more memorable than a monument as high as the moon. I love better to see stones in place. The grandeur of Thebes was a vulgar grandeur. More sensible is a rod of stone wall that bounds an honest man's field than a hundred-gated Thebes that has wandered farther from the true end of life. The religion and civilization which are barbaric and heathenish build splendid temples; but what you might call Christianity does not. Most of the stone a nation hammers goes toward its tomb only. It buries itself alive. As for the Pyramids, there is nothing to wonder at in them so much as the fact that so many men could be found degraded enough to spend their lives constructing a tomb for some ambitious booby, whom it would have been wiser and manlier to have drowned in the Nile, and then given his body to the dogs. I might possibly invent some excuse for them and him, but I have no time for it. As for the religion and love of art of the builders, it is much the same all the world over, whether the building be an Egyptian temple or the United States Bank. It costs more than it comes to. The mainspring is vanity, assisted by the love of garlic and bread and butter. Mr. Balcom, a promising young architect, designs it on the back of his Vitruvius, with <b>hard</b> <b>pencil</b> and ruler, and the job is let out to Dobson & Sons, stonecutters. When the thirty centuries begin to look down on it, mankind begin to look up at it. As for your high towers and monuments, there was a crazy fellow once in this town who undertook to dig through to China, and he got so far that, as he said, he heard the Chinese pots and kettles rattle; but I think that I shall not go out of my way to admire the hole which he made. Many are concerned about the monuments of the West and the East--to know who built them. For my part, I should like to know who in those days did not build them--who were above such trifling. But to proceed with my statistics.|$|E
5000|$|The French {{comic book}} Asterix and Cleopatra, {{published}} first in serial form {{the same year}} the film was released, parodies the film. In particular, {{the cover of the}} comic book mocks the films massive casts and sets by claiming it is the [...] "Greatest story ever drawn" [...] and that [...] "14 litres of India ink, 30 brushes, 62 soft pencils, 1 <b>hard</b> <b>pencil,</b> 27 rubbers, 1984 sheets of paper, 16 typewriter ribbons, 2 typewriters, 366 pints of beer went into its creation!"

50|$|Although he {{has also}} {{occasionally}} used gouache, and more recently has often worked in acrylics, Edwards' original medium of choice is oil paint. This is used on any smooth board, ideally hardboard, which is primed with gesso. Following from preliminary sketches, images are constructed on the support with a <b>hard</b> <b>pencil</b> before being developed using washes of a neutral coloured acryclic, usually brown, a technique Edwards says he borrowed from 'the old masters'. The oils are mixed with an alkyd medium called liquin, which thins the paint and speeds drying time. Edwards and Miller are also separated by distinctions of medium, with pieces under the Miller name more typically executed in acylic paint on canvas panels as opposed to Edward's more usual use of oils on smooth board. Recently Edwards has also begun working in the digital medium with programs like Painter, enjoying the freedom afforded with computers, although he continues to express a preference for traditional painting techniques.|$|E

50|$|Elmar Peintner rose to {{popularity}} at {{the beginning}} of the 1980s. He was a contemporary artist best known for his “Menschenbilder” (senescent children pictures), usually executed with <b>hard</b> <b>pencils</b> and additional water-colour, the models being from the family circle, the neighbourhood, or local rest homes. In the forefront, as with all his work, is not the naturalistic reproduction of nature, but the attempt to penetrate to the physical and mental structure of man via realism of microstructures.|$|R
5000|$|As of 2009, {{a set of}} pencils {{ranging from}} a very <b>hard,</b> light-marking <b>pencil</b> to a very soft, black-marking pencil usually ranges from hardest to softest as follows: ...|$|R
50|$|The main {{market for}} such {{wide range of}} grades are artists who are {{interested}} in creating a full range of tones from light grey to black. Engineers prefer <b>harder</b> <b>pencils</b> which allow for a greater control {{in the shape of the}} lead. This is reflected in the way pencils are packaged and marketed. For example, for its Graphic pencils Derwent offers three packages of 12 pencils each: Technical (with hard grades from 9H to B), Sketching (with soft grades H to 9B), and Designer (with medium grades 4H to 6B).|$|R
50|$|The various {{graphite}} pencil {{grades are}} achieved by altering {{the proportion of}} graphite to clay: the more clay the <b>harder</b> the <b>pencil.</b> Two pencils of the same grade but different manufacturers will not necessarily make a mark of identical tone nor have the same hardness.|$|R
5000|$|Snow {{hardness}} (R [...] ) is {{the resistance}} to penetration of an object into snow. Most snow studies use a fist or fingers for softer snows (very soft through medium) and a <b>pencil</b> (<b>hard)</b> or knife (very hard) below the hardness boundary of ice.|$|R

5000|$|Planning {{for wood}} {{finishing}} also involves {{being aware of}} how the finishing process influences the end result. Careful handling of the wood is needed to avoid dents, scratches and soiling with dirt. Wood should be marked for cutting using pencil rather than ink; however, avoid <b>hard</b> or soft <b>pencil.</b> HB is recommend for face work and 2H for joint work. Care {{should be taken to}} avoid squeeze-out of glue from joints because the glue will reduce absorption of stain and finish. Any excess glue should be carefully removed to avoid further damage to the wood.|$|R
6000|$|No. 1. pocket Memorandum Book, {{measuring}} {{three inches}} {{and a half}} by five, made of strong paper. (Captain Blakston did not use, and I should not advise travellers to use, [...] "prepared" [...] paper, for it soon becomes rotten, and the leaves fall out; besides that, wet makes the paper soppy.) The books are paged with bold numbers printed in the corners; two faint red lines are ruled {{down the middle of}} each page, half an inch apart, to enable the book {{to be used as a}} field-surveyor's book when required. In this pocket=book, every single thing that is recorded at all, is originally recorded with a <b>hard</b> HHH <b>pencil.</b> Everything is written consecutively, without confusion or attempt to save space. There may easily be 150 pages in each of these books; and a sufficient number should be procured to admit of having at least one per month. Do not stint yourself in these.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Snowpack {{properties}} {{aiming at}} avalanche safety for backcountry recreations were investigated at Hakuba, NORTHAN ALPS, JAPAN. Snow profile {{results of this}} study (total 111 pit), which was from December 1999 to March 2002 at Hakuba region delineated the following snowpack characteristics for that region. Maximal snow-depth is around 4 m and maritime characteristics predominate. Although the most commonly identified weak-layers consist of large new snow crystals without rime, on a relative scale the grains are not so large (2 - 3 mm) size, and layers not so weak. Surface hoar and faceted crystals near the snow surface are rare. Rains in high winter is not uncommon and often results in a <b>hard</b> layer (<b>pencil</b> or higher) and weak bond interface with new snow layers. In areas of shallow coverage due to wind transportation often caused by strong seasonal Northwest winds, depth hoar growth is prevalent near the ground. Also a tendency for rapid change was also seen between wet grains to depth hoar and back...|$|R
60|$|Best {{form for}} Memoranda.--I have remarked {{that almost every}} {{traveller}} who is distinguished for the copiousness and accuracy of his journals, has written them in a remarkably small but distinct handwriting. <b>Hard</b> pencil-marks (HHH <b>pencils)</b> on common paper, or on metallic paper are very durable. Dr. Barth wrote his numerous observations entirely in Indian-ink. He kept a tiny saucer in his pocket, rubbed with the ink; {{when he wanted to}} use it, he rubbed it up with his wetted finger-tip, or resupplied it with fresh ink, and filled his pen and wrote. Captain Burton wrote very much in the dark, when lying awake at night; he used a board with prominent lines of wood, such as is adopted by the blind. It is very important that what is written should be intelligible to a stranger after a long lapse of time. A traveller may die, and his uncompleted work perish with him; or he may return, and years will pass by, and suddenly some observations he had made will be called in question.|$|R
