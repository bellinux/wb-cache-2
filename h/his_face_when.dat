5|$|Sleeping Dogs is an action-adventure game set {{in an open}} world {{environment}} and played from a third-person perspective. The player controls Wei Shen, a Chinese-American police officer who goes undercover and infiltrates the Sun On Yee Triad organization. The first missions of the game are a linear tutorial for controlling the character. After these missions, the player is allowed to explore the game's world and take part in side missions and other activities. Shen navigates the world by running, jumping, climbing over obstacles, swimming, and driving cars, boats and motorcycles. The heads-up display (HUD) interface features a mini-map that indicates targets, key locations (safe houses and contact points) and Shen's current position. The mini-map incorporates two meters: one shows Shen's health and the other <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> <b>When</b> the face meter fills, upgrades are unlocked such as health regeneration, improved combat abilities and reduced equipment costs. The HUD also displays the weapon carried and its ammunition count.|$|E

500|$|Rod Pont (also {{known as}} Steve Day in Steve Day and the Drifters) remembered Storm {{arriving}} at the Orrell Park Ballroom for a concert with a boil on <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> <b>When</b> told about it, Storm pulled out a black velvet hood which had slits for his eyes and mouth, and played the whole concert with the hood on. At one concert at Bankfield House Youth club, Garston, Liverpool, in 1965, the stage lighting failed between sets. Storm was upset until someone walked in with a torch, which Storm used to finish the concert. He occasionally used a pet monkey {{in some of the}} group's performances, as it attracted more people. At a New Brighton swimming baths performance for 1,600 people in 1963, Storm climbed to the top diving board, undressed to a pair of swimming trunks, and then dived into the water {{at the end of a}} song. In January 1964, during a performance at the Majestic Ballroom, Birkenhead, he climbed up one of the columns supporting the balcony, but slipped and fell [...] to the floor below, fracturing his leg. At another performance on the New Brighton Pier, Storm made his way onto the Pavilion roof but fell through the glass skylight.|$|E

2500|$|El Santo {{was known}} to never remove his mask, even in private company. When {{traveling}} on flights, he made sure {{to take a different}} flight from his crew to avoid having them see <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>when</b> he was required to remove his mask to get through customs. Since his regular mask did not allow him to eat, he had a special [...] "mealtime" [...] variation made with the mouth cut away.|$|E
2500|$|The {{police and}} {{prosecution}} maintained that he cable tied her hands {{behind her back}} in the bedroom in preparation for rape, and then used a cable tie as a ligature to murder her when her blindfold slipped and she saw <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> <b>When</b> asked why he had abducted Tiernan, he replied: [...] "I have no idea". When police challenged his version of taking the body to Lindley Woods soon after the murder, he claimed that he had first kept the body hidden underneath pallets in his back garden, and then stored her inside his sofa.|$|E
2500|$|In 1975, Ali {{began an}} affair with Veronica Porché, an actress and model.

She flew out to Manila to confront Ali and scratched <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>when</b> they argued. Belinda later said that her marriage to Ali was a [...] "rollercoaster ride—it had its ups and its downs but it was fun". Referring to his infidelities, she said: [...] "Tiger Woods and Arnold Schwarzenegger didn't have nothing on Muhammad Ali". She believed he had [...] "many more" [...] illegitimate children.|$|E

2500|$|His {{decision}} to restore Bryennios’s rank {{but not his}} estates or fortune confiscated by the empress Theodora, and insulting Bryennios to <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>when</b> he complained to Michael VI in person proved to be his undoing. Michael VI compounded his error by rebuffing Bryennios after he had already ordered the restored general to lead a division of 3,000 men to reinforce the army in Cappadocia. From here Bryennios began plotting to overthrow the emperor. On his arrival however, he attacked and beat {{a representative of the}} emperor who countermanded Nikephoros's orders before throwing him in prison, which his officers took as a sign that Nikephoros was about to rebel. [...] Releasing the imprisoned officer, they captured Nikephoros, blinded him and sent him to Constantinople.|$|E
2500|$|Empire.com ranked him #46 {{in their}} list of the 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time, praising the look on <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>when</b> he {{strangles}} a cop with his own handcuffs and that [...] "when American novelist Cormac McCarthy wants to throw a dark character at you, it's a safe assumption that you're {{not going to be}} able to get them out of your head for a good, long while - if ever. One of his best is Chigurh, and between the Coens and Bardem, they never missed a beat in bringing this monster to the screen. With the kind of unholy relentlessness usually reserved for horror icons, the hired killer has an almost supernatural ability to track his prey, and is rather short in the mercy department, preferring to leave the tough decisions to a coin toss. And that bowl cut is utterly terrifying." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kumar {{is said to}} {{have been}} {{paranoid}} about not being paid. During recordings, he would sing only after his secretary confirmed that the producer had made the payment. On one occasion, when he discovered that his dues had not been fully paid, he appeared on set with makeup on only one side of <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> <b>When</b> the director questioned him, he replied [...] "Aadha paisa to aadha make-up." [...] (Half make-up for half payment). On the sets of Bhai Bhai, Kishore Kumar refused to act because the director M V Raman owed him [...] 5,000. Ashok Kumar persuaded him to do the scene but when the shooting started, Kishore walked a few paces and said, Paanch Hazaar Rupaiya (five thousand rupees) and did a somersault. After he reached the end of the floor, he left the studio. On another occasion, when producer R.C. Talwar did not pay his dues in spite of repeated reminders, Kumar arrived at Talwar's residence shouting [...] "Hey Talwar, de de mere aath hazaar" [...] ("Hey Talwar, give me my eight thousand") every morning until Talwar paid up.|$|E

2500|$|A blatant bigot, McReynolds {{would not}} accept [...] "Jews, drinkers, blacks, women, smokers, married or engaged individuals" [...] as law clerks. Time [...] "called him 'Puritanical', 'intolerably rude', 'savagely sarcastic', 'incredibly reactionary', and 'anti-Semitic'". McReynolds refused to speak to Louis Brandeis, the first Jewish member of the Court, for three years {{following}} Brandeis's appointment and, when Brandeis retired in 1939, did not sign the customary dedicatory letter sent to justices on their retirement. He habitually left the conference room whenever Brandeis spoke. When Benjamin Cardozo's appointment was being pressed on President Herbert C. Hoover, McReynolds joined with fellow justices Pierce Butler and Willis Van Devanter in urging the White House not to [...] "afflict the Court with another Jew". When news of Cardozo's appointment was announced, McReynolds is claimed to have said [...] "Huh, {{it seems that the}} only way you can get on the Supreme Court these days is to be either the son of a criminal or a Jew, or both." [...] During Cardozo's swearing-in ceremony, McReynolds pointedly read a newspaper, and would often hold a brief or record in front of <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>when</b> Cardozo delivered an opinion from the bench. Likewise, he refused to sign opinions authored by Brandeis.|$|E
2500|$|Xu Sheng {{was known}} for his {{confidence}} and fervent loyalty towards Sun Quan, as demonstrated in the incident when Xing Zhen (邢貞) came to confer the title [...] "King of Wu" [...] (吳王) on Sun Quan. In 220, Sun Quan became a vassal of the state of Cao Wei, which replaced the Han dynasty after the Wei founder, Cao Pi, forced Emperor Xian to abdicate the throne to him. Cao Pi sent Xing Zhen as an emissary to meet Sun Quan and confer the title [...] "King of Wu" [...] (吳王) on him. Xing Zhen behaved arrogantly in front of Sun Quan and incurred much anger from Sun Quan's subjects, including Zhang Zhao and Xu Sheng. Xu Sheng told his colleagues, [...] "Isn't it humiliating to watch our lord submit to Xing Zhen {{and not be able to}} serve him with our lives and help him conquer Xu, Luoyang and Bashu?" [...] Tears rolled down <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> <b>When</b> Xing Zhen heard Xu Sheng's remark, he told an aide, [...] "It's obvious from the reactions of the subjects of Jiangdong that they won't remain subservient for long." [...] Xing Zhen was right, because in 222, Sun Quan declared independence from Wei but continued ruling his domain under the title [...] "King of Wu" [...] before declaring himself emperor in 229.|$|E
