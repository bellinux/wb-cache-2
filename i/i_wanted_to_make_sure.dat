500|$|Vespertine is {{an album}} {{made by a}} {{character}} who's very introvert.(sic) And it's about the universe inside every person. This time around, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that the scenery of the songs is not like a mountain or a city or outside, it's inside, so it's very internal. So I guess all three videos are very internal. [...] Sort of how you communicate with {{the world in a}} very intimate, personal way.|$|E
500|$|Mackin also {{composed}} {{an entire}} string section and conducted an orchestra in the album. In {{an interview with}} Daily Nexus in June 2006, Mackin revealed that the conducting was the easy part and that the composing part was much harder. In this interview, Mackin also commented, [...] "composing was getting so frustrating since I wasn’t writing as fast as my mind was thinking, so going back <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that each of my arrangements for this album and the 12 different songs were completely different".|$|E

500|$|Solo {{played in}} 22 WPS matches in 2010 {{for both the}} Athletica and the Beat and was the league-leader in saves with 104. The two-time WPS All-Star also ranked among the top three in shutouts (6), wins (6), and goals against average (1.64). After {{the end of the}} 2010 season, Solo {{underwent}} surgery on her right shoulder on September 22. [...] "These next two years are huge for the national team with the World Cup and Olympics on the horizon and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that I would be giving my team and my country my best on the field," [...] Solo said of the surgery. [...] "I've been having some painful issues with the shoulder for a while and for a goalkeeper it's been difficult physically and mentally to play with this kind of an injury, so {{it was time to get}} it taken care of." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{lot of my}} {{performances}} {{have had}} fire involved, so we thought 'Heat.' Also, red {{is one of my}} favorite colors, as is gold. So then we thought of making the bottle look like it's on fire. I love antique bottles — my mother had a collection of them when I was growing up. I wanted something with an antique yet modern feeling. Even with my wardrobe, I always try to find things that have a little bit of something vintage, yet still timeless and classic. The bottle, I felt, was a great mixture of the two... Everything, from the bottle design to the name and the ideas for the commercials–that's me. When I commit to something, I do it 100 percent, and I've never had [...] until this project. I learned a lot of great things from the past — but I always asked myself, 'If I could have my own scent, what would it be?' I wasn't worried about deadlines. It could have taken me three, four, however many years — this was my first fragrance, and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that it was something I would love forever.|$|E
500|$|Soon, Shakira {{began work}} on her next studio album, titled She Wolf, which was, among other places, {{recorded}} at the Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Shakira said that specifically chose the studio after she learned that it had previously been used for recording sessions by artists like Bob Marley, The Cure, and AC/DC, of whom she is a fan. Unlike most of her previous projects, which are predominantly composed of Latin and pop rock styles, She Wolf is an electropop album with world music influences. When asked why the album had electronic influences, Shakira responded, [...] "I felt very curious and intrigued about the electro-pop world and everything it has to offer. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that this album was very bassy and that the kicks hit really hard, and I wanted {{to concentrate on the}} beat. But my music, to a certain extent, is very complex– because I always try to experiment with sounds {{from other parts of the}} world." [...] Explaining the meaning behind the title, Shakira said that [...] "'She Wolf' is the woman of our time. The woman who knows what she wants and is free of prejudice and preconceived notions. She defends her deepest desires with teeth and claws like a wild animal".|$|E

5000|$|The Haus of Gaga {{is modeled}} after Andy Warhol's Factory and emulates the {{creative}} atmosphere {{it is known}} for. Inspired by Warhol's concepts, his ideas are often referenced in Gaga's work and the innovative technologies conceived by the Haus. [...] "Warhol said art should be meaningful in the most shallow way," [...] Gaga explained in an interview. [...] "He was able <b>to</b> <b>make</b> commercial art that was taken seriously as fine art ... that's what I'm doing too." [...] The team is composed of {{people from around the}} world. As the artist explained:I called all my coolest art friends and we sat in a room and I said that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> my face light up. Or that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> my cane light up. Or that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a pair of dope sunglasses. Or that <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> video glasses, or whatever it was that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do. It's a whole amazing creative process that’s completely separate from the label.By integrating the themes explored in Gaga's music into her appearance, the Haus idealizes a lifestyle hybrid of pop culture, art, and technology.|$|R
2500|$|Later in 2011, it was {{reported}} that producer Rico Love was working with Monica on her seventh studio album, New Life. Love then conceived a track titled [...] "It All Belongs to Me", which was written as a loose sequel to [...] "The Boy is Mine". He stated that [...] "It All Belongs to Me" [...] is essentially picking up where [...] "The Boy is Mine" [...] left off. [...] "It’s a very soulful R song with pop sensibilities. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> I made it a classic R record, but I definitely {{wanted to make sure that}} it had enough appeal to cross over and become a Top 40 record". [...] "It All Belongs to Me" [...] was released as an official single on February 10, 2012, through RCA Records. The song is also slated to appear on both singers' albums.|$|E

I went to Molly's room and I was showing her how I set up my computer so I can access it from anywhere. I turned on my camera and saw you {{in the corner of}} the screen and I immediately closed it. I felt uncomfortable and guilty of what happened. Obviously I told people what occurred so they could give me advice. Then Tuesday when you requested the room again <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> what happened Sunday wouldn't happen again and not to video chat me from 930 to 12. Just in case, I turned my camera away and put my computer to sleep so even if anyone tried it wouldn't work. I wanted to make amends for Sunday night. I'm sorry if you heard something distorted and disturbing but I assure you all my actions were good natured." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{television}} drama Medium, which aired from 2005 until 2011 on NBC and CBS {{is based}} on Allison DuBois's book, Don't Kiss Them Good-Bye. [...] The show was created by Glenn Gordon Caron, creator of Moonlighting and other television shows, who {{is also one of}} the writers for the series. [...] It is produced by CBS Television Studios (having acquired the TV production arm of original producer Paramount Pictures) and Grammnet, the production company owned by Cheers and Frasier alumnus Kelsey Grammer. [...] Patricia Arquette was cast to play the role of DuBois, at the suggestion of Caron's girlfriend. DuBois stated in the January 9, 2005 TV Guide that she initially thought Arquette was too liberal to play her, remarking, [...] "I mean, I have a gun, I have put people on death row. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that was something that didn't bother her.

During an interview with Sway in the Morning in February 2012, Ciara revealed that she would be taking her time recording her fifth studio album. In June 2012, Ciara spoke about the album saying [...] "It really is just me pouring my heart into the record, and I think my fans deserve that. I really had to be in a comfortable place, and I really am and I'm excited about it, that's the beauty of music. Music is like really being able to express yourself. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that I expressed myself in the best way that I could, and I let the music also be a healing process for me at points. There's a lot of happy moments as well, so that's what it's about. That's music. You laugh, you cry, you dance, you love, you hurt, you feel all kinds of things. That's the beauty of music." ...|$|E
2500|$|Robyn {{performed}} the song on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge on 16 June 2010. She also {{performed the}} song on Capital 95.8 FM during a live session on 23 June 2010.

On 12 September 2010, Robyn performed a remixed version of the song with in-house DJ deadmau5 at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards. The two did not rehearse the performance until the morning of the show, and Robyn said, [...] "I met him for, like, five minutes, and then we were playing." [...] A few days later, Robyn spoke to MTV News about the performance, saying, [...] "usually, awards shows can be so strange, but [...] felt really real.

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Independent, Rowland admitted that with her first two records she struggled to find her sound. [...] "I was in a stage with the first two records where I was searching and I was like, let me try a rock-dance approach, the label [...] wanted me to try it and I did it... And then after that came a more urban approach with Ms. Kelly in 2007." [...] She further described the songs on her previous albums as sounding very much the same, which {{led her to the}} realisation that she [...] "needed refreshing". She told Entertainment Focus that meeting French DJ David Guetta [...] "changed her perspective and helped to inspire the new sound". She then spent more time in Europe in 2009, something which she said had influenced her. [...] "It's different being over here in Europe and just being able to look at different magazines and fashion shows and things like that. And just thinking about the look and working with different stylists as well. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> it was a look that was all me, you know?."

[...] In July 2010, Rowland said during {{an interview}} with Alex Catarinella of Paper magazine that [...] "I spent about a year of my life in Europe really listening to a whole bunch of European DJs and hearing dance music a lot on the radio and really loving it.
