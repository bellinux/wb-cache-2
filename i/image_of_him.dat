5|$|Dean was {{the highest}} ranking UN {{prisoner}} of war of the Korean War. He was also the highest ranking Medal of Honor recipient. His story of capture and imprisonment by the North Koreans was recorded by numerous publications. His initial capture was covered by Life Magazine in July 1950 with a photo essay detailing his life. In December 1951, when he was discovered to be alive, TIME Magazine did an article on his story and imprisonment, featuring an <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> on the magazine's front cover. He subsequently received more attention from the press. Multiple media outlets attempted to interview Dean but the North Koreans rarely allowed it. Few photos and little information on his status was released, mostly that which showed him in good condition. After his release, Dean's story, as well as Lee's, was told in Life Magazine.|$|E
5|$|Several {{newspapers}} published {{images of}} Tomlinson's {{first encounter with}} police that evening. According to Barry Smith, Tomlinson left the newspaper stand outside Monument Tube Station at around 7pm. The Daily Mail published an image showing Tomlinson smoking a cigarette {{in front of a}} police van in Lombard Street. An eyewitness, IT worker Ross Hardy, said Tomlinson was drunk and refusing to move; a police van tried to nudge him out of the way, and when that didn't work he was moved by four riot officers. The newspaper published a second <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> apparently being pushed by the police. On 16 April The Guardian published three images of Tomlinson taken at the same time.|$|E
25|$|His {{direct and}} tough policy towards North Korea {{promoted}} a negative <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> throughout North Korea. Lee's name became a target {{practice in the}} North Korean military as shown through the Korean Central Television on 6 March 2012.|$|E

25|$|Moroşanu {{is married}} and has one daughter. He is a law student, and also owns his own kickboxing gym in his home country of Romania. A notably {{interesting}} fact about Moroşanu is that the K-1 promotion arbitrarily created the <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> as a crop farmer. In one of their promotional video-clips, Moroşanu appears driving an old tractor.|$|E
25|$|Pynson {{is often}} {{considered}} a more accomplished stylist than Caxton; he favored a dialect of English called Chancery Standard {{and contributed to}} the standardization of early Modern English. Pynson's usage of devices, title-pages, types, and other technical aspects lend support to the common <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> as a highly skilled craftsman and capable businessman who invented nothing but was quite good at improving upon innovations others had made before.|$|E
25|$|Written around 1080, one of {{the oldest}} written sources on pre-Christian Scandinavian {{religious}} practices is Adam of Bremen's Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum. Adam claimed to have access to first-hand accounts on pagan practices in Sweden. He refers to Freyr with the Latinized name Fricco and mentions that an <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> at Skara was destroyed by the Christian missionary, Bishop Egino. His description of the Temple at Uppsala gives some details on the god.|$|E
50|$|Tanikaze was a {{very popular}} rikishi. Unlike other wrestlers of his day, many nishikie (woodblock print based) portraits and <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> {{participating}} in bouts still remain.|$|R
50|$|Kokopelli {{has been}} revered {{since at least}} the time of the Hohokam, Yuman, and Ancestral Pueblo peoples. The first known <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> appear on Hohokam pottery dated to {{sometime}} between 750 and 850 AD.|$|R
50|$|Steinman and {{his firm}} {{were also in}} charge of the major {{rehabilitation}} of the Brooklyn Bridge commencing 1948. Structurae.de has an <b>image</b> <b>of</b> Steinman jauntily perched in mid air in the cables of the bridge, perhaps one of the best known <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
25|$|The <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> {{waving the}} ball fair {{changed the way}} {{baseball}} was televised. During this time, cameramen covering baseball were instructed to follow the flight of the ball. In a 1999 interview, NBC cameraman Lou Gerard {{said that he had}} been distracted by a nearby rat. Unable to follow the ball, he kept the camera on Fisk instead. This play was perhaps the most important catalyst in getting camera operators to focus most of their attention on the players themselves.|$|E
25|$|Sri Ramana led {{a modest}} and renunciate life. However, {{according}} to David Godman, {{who has written}} extensively about Ramana, a popular <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> as a person who {{spent most of his time}} doing nothing except sitting silently in samadhi is highly inaccurate. From the period when an Ashram began to rise around him after his mother arrived, until his later years when his health failed, Ramana was actually quite active in Ashram activities such as cooking and stitching leaf plates.|$|E
25|$|For many years, {{only one}} {{confirmed}} photograph {{of him was}} known to exist outside North Korea, apparently taken in the mid-1990s, when he was eleven. Occasionally other supposed images of him surfaced but were often disputed. It was only in June 2010, shortly before he was given official posts and publicly introduced to the North Korean people, that more pictures were released of Kim, taken when he was attending school in Switzerland. The first official <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> as an adult was a group photograph released on 30 September 2010, {{at the end of}} the party conference that effectively anointed him, in which he is seated in the front row, two places from his father. This was followed by newsreel footage of him attending the conference.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to Mickey's overt {{presence in the}} parks, numerous <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> are also subtly included in sometimes unexpected places. This phenomenon is known as [...] "Hidden Mickey", involving hidden images in Disney films, theme parks, and merchandise.|$|R
5000|$|... • Since Erhard of Regensburg was {{considered}} a patron saint for livestock, <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> were used as Schluckbildchen and given to sick animals in the German folk medicine during the eighteenth, nineteenth {{and the beginning of}} the twentieth century.|$|R
5000|$|In {{an attempt}} to quit the [...] "A*Teens Boy" [...] <b>Image,</b> sexy <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> and a girl were shown on the video, but this failed to get the public's attention. The music video had respectable {{rotation}} on Swedish music channels.|$|R
25|$|Late in the 1930s, Codreanu's {{supporters}} began publishing books praising his virtues, {{among which}} are Vasile Marin's Crez de Generație ("Generation Credo") and Nicolae Roșu's Orientări în Veac ("Orientations in the Century"), both published in 1937. After the National Legionary State officially hailed Corneliu Zelea Codreanu as a martyr to the cause, his image {{came to be}} used as a propaganda tool in cultural contexts. Codreanu was integrated into the Legionary cult of death: usually at Iron Guard rallies, Codreanu and other fallen members were mentioned and greeted with the shout Prezent! ("Present!"). His personality cult was reflected into Legionary art, and a stylized <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> was displayed at major rallies, including the notorious and large-scale Bucharest ceremony of October 6, 1940. Although Codreanu was officially condemned by the communist regime a generation later, it is possible that, in its final stage under Nicolae Ceaușescu, it came to use the Captain's personality cult as a source of inspiration. The post-communist Noua Dreaptă, which publicizes portraits of Codreanu in the form of Orthodox icons, often makes use of such representation in its public rallies, usually associating it with its own symbol, the Celtic cross.|$|E
500|$|Berg {{served on}} Princeton University's Board of Trustees from 1999 to 2003. In 2000, he began researching a {{biography}} of Woodrow Wilson, of whom Berg says, [...] "I have an <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> {{in my mind that}} is unlike any picture I have seen anywhere else, based on material at Princeton and 35 years of researching and thinking about him". Wilson was published on September 10, 2013.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" [...] had a {{considerable}} impact on D'Angelo's recording career, as it helped engender an <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> {{as a sex}} icon to a younger generation of fans. However, his discontent with this image led to his period of absence from the music scene following {{the conclusion of the}} supporting tour for Voodoo. The song won a Grammy Award for Best Male R Vocal Performance at the 43rd Grammy Awards in 2001. Rolling Stone magazine named [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" [...] the fourth best single of 2000. The magazine later named it the fifty-first best song of the 2000s (decade).|$|E
5000|$|During the 2004 dinner, President George W.

50|$|Filmed in California but set in Indiana, {{the film}} {{is based on a}} story by James Whitcomb Riley.

500|$|Eric Duvauchelle, who {{was then}} part of Roc-A-Fella's {{in-house}} brand design team, was assigned for the artwork of The College Dropout. West had already taken pictures dressed as the Dropout Bear - which would reappear in his later work - and Duvauchelle picked the <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> sitting {{on a set of}} bleachers, as he got attracted to the loneliness of {{what was supposed to be}} [...] "the most popular representation of a school". The image is framed inside gold ornaments, which Duvauchelle found in a book of illustrations from the 16th-century and West wanted to use to [...] "bring a sense of elegance and style to what was typically a gangster-led image of rap artists". The inside cover follows a college yearbook, with photos of the featured artists of the albums from their youth.|$|E
500|$|Conan brought Schwarzenegger {{worldwide}} {{recognition as}} an action star and established {{the model for}} most of his film roles: [...] "icy, brawny, and inexpressiveyet somehow endearing." [...] The <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> as the barbarian was an enduring one; when he campaigned for George H. W. Bush to be president, he was introduced as [...] "Conan the Republican"a moniker that stuck with him throughout his political career and was often repeated by the media during his term as Governor of California. [...] Schwarzenegger was aware of the benefits the film had brought to him, acknowledging the role of Conan as [...] "God's gift to [...] career." [...] He embraced the image: when he was Governor of California, he displayed his copy of the Atlantean sword in his office, occasionally flourishing the weapon at visitors and letting them play with it. [...] More than once, he spiced up his speeches with Conan's [...] "crush your enemies, see them driven before you and hear the lamentations of their women".|$|E
500|$|A {{parody of}} da Vinci's The Last Supper, {{the picture was}} taken by Hollywood glamour {{photographer}} Ken Marcus. Clayson has speculated on the symbolism and hidden messages within the photo: whether the nurse with a pram, set back from {{and to the left}} of the dining table, was a reference to Boyd's inability to conceive a child; and the empty, distant wheelchair in memory of Harrison's late mother. Allison finds evidence of Harrison's antipathy towards organised religion in this inner-gatefold photo, following on from the lyrics to his 1970 song [...] "Awaiting on You All". In order to add to Harrison's [...] "mystique", author Bruce Spizer writes, Wilkes placed a colour <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> over the main, black-and-white print. The same detail echoed the contrast in [...] "Living in the Material World" [...] between the illusory nature of human existence and what Allison describes as the [...] "vital, eternal reality" [...] offered by spiritual enlightenment.|$|E
50|$|She and Eakins both {{shared a}} passion for photography, both as photographers and subjects, and {{employed}} it {{as a tool for}} their art. She also posed nude for many of his photos and took <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> Both had separate studios in their home.|$|R
50|$|There {{is also a}} nude Prince Harry, {{inspired}} by the media <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> while he was holidaying in Las Vegas. This work {{can be found in}} the bathrooms of the Winchester Bar in Angel as well as at the skate park along the Embankment in London.|$|R

500|$|Murphy {{received}} orders on 8 June 1945, {{to report}} to Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas. At a 13 June San Antonio homecoming parade held for returning Texas veterans, {{a quarter of a}} million people cheered Murphy, Charles P. Cabell, Lucian Truscott, Harold L. Clark and others. He was then assigned to the Army Ground & Services Redistribution Station at the base and given 30 days leave. Murphy was the home grown hero, and on a visit to Dallas, the media followed his every move, interviewing and photographing him. Farmersville pulled out all the stops, giving him an escort caravan, and five thousand local citizens showed up to hear a band concert and speeches in his honor. He was the star attraction at the 2 to 4 July McKinney rodeo where he opened the event every night. The 16 July issue of Life magazine brought Murphy national attention when its cover story proclaimed him [...] "most decorated" [...] next to a smiling <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> in full dress uniform. Photographers for the magazine followed him to a birthday party in his honor, to his first civilian haircut since 1942, and around to visit friends and relatives.|$|E
500|$|The Jesuit priest John Gerard {{described}} Keyes as [...] "a {{grave and}} sober man, and of great wit and sufficiency". [...] Father Oswald Tesimond claimed that Keyes had [...] "tasted persecution himself, having lost his goods because of it" [...] while historian and author Cyril Northcote Parkinson's <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> {{was of a}} [...] "desperate man, ruined and indebted". [...] Tall, with a red beard, despite his relative poverty Catesby declared him [...] "a trusty honest man", and may have paid him for his services. [...] Like fellow plotter Guy Fawkes, he was thought capable of looking after himself. [...] Several conspirators expressed concerns {{about the safety of}} fellow Catholics who would be at Parliament {{on the day of the}} planned explosion; Keyes was particularly worried about Lord Mordaunt, his wife's employer. [...] Thomas Percy was concerned for his patron, Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland, and the Lords Vaux, Montague, Monteagle and Stourton were also mentioned. [...] Keyes's suggestion to warn Lord Mordaunt was treated by Catesby with derision, when he answered that [...] "he would not for the chamber full of diamonds acquaint him with the secret, for that he knew he could not keep it." ...|$|E
