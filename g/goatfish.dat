5|$|Hunting {{is often}} {{performed}} alone, but L. colubrina may also {{do so in}} large numbers {{in the company of}} hunting parties of giant trevally and <b>goatfish.</b> This cooperative hunting technique {{is similar to that of}} the moray eel, with the banded sea kraits flushing out prey from narrow crevices and holes, and the trevally and <b>goatfish</b> feeding on fleeing prey.|$|E
5|$|The known diet of the {{dusky shark}} {{encompasses}} pelagic fishes, including herring and anchovies, tuna and mackerel, billfish, jacks, needlefish and flyingfish, threadfins, hairtails, lancetfish, and lanternfish; demersal fishes, including mullets, porgies, grunts, and flatheads, eels, lizardfish, cusk eels, gurnards, and flatfish; reef fishes, including barracudas, <b>goatfish,</b> spadefish, groupers, scorpionfish, and porcupinefish; cartilaginous fishes, including dogfish, sawsharks, angel sharks, catsharks, thresher sharks, smoothhounds, smaller requiem sharks, sawfish, guitarfish, skates, stingrays, and butterfly rays; and invertebrates, including cephalopods, decapod crustaceans, barnacles, and sea stars. Very rarely, the largest dusky sharks may also consume sea turtles, marine mammals (mainly as carrion), and human refuse.|$|E
5|$|The sand {{devil is}} an ambush {{predator}} that spends much time {{buried in the}} bottom sediment. Its diet consists mainly of demersal teleost fishes such as croakers, goatfishes, and butterfishes. However, some types of demersal fishes such as jacks are rarely eaten, perhaps {{because they are more}} active and thus likely to escape attacks. Squid are a major secondary food source, particularly for smaller sharks. Crabs, shrimp, mantis shrimp, skates, and bivalves are infrequently eaten. This species feeds both during the day and at night. It tends to select prey approximately 50–60% as long as its mouth is wide; this size is consistent with what is predicted from optimal foraging theory to yield the most efficient rate of energy return. The variety of prey taken is greatest in fall and least in winter, and smaller sharks have a more varied diet than larger ones. In the northern Gulf of Mexico, the most important prey species are Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus), longspine porgy (Stenotomus caprinus), spot croaker (Leiostomus xanthurus), Gulf butterfish (Peprilus burti), red <b>goatfish</b> (Mullus auratus), dwarf <b>goatfish</b> (Upeneus parvus), and longfin inshore squid (Doryteuthis pealeii). The relative importance of each differs across seasons (for example, squid are more important in winter), perhaps due to seasonal variation in their availability. A known parasite of the sand devil is the copepod Eudactylina spinula.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{abundant}} stingrays inhabiting Indo-Pacific reefs, the bluespotted ribbontail ray generally spends the day hidden alone inside caves or under coral ledges or other debris (including from shipwrecks), often with only its tail showing. At night, small groups assemble and swim onto shallow sandy flats with the rising tide to feed. Unlike many other stingrays, this species seldom buries itself in sand. The bluespotted ribbontail ray excavates sand pits in search of molluscs, polychaete worms, shrimps, crabs, and small benthic bony fishes; when prey is located, it is trapped by {{the body of the}} ray and maneuvered into the mouth with the disc. Other fishes, such as <b>goatfish,</b> frequently follow foraging rays, seeking food missed by the ray.|$|E
25|$|The bluestripe snapper {{is part of}} {{an unusual}} mimicry {{relationship}} with the <b>goatfish,</b> Mulloidichthys mimicus, the colouration of which nearly exactly matches that of the snapper. The <b>goatfish</b> school alongside the snapper, with this behavior attributed to predatory protection. The <b>goatfish</b> are presumably a more preferred prey than bluestripe snapper.|$|E
25|$|<b>Goatfish</b> are tireless benthic feeders, using {{a pair of}} long chemosensory barbels (whiskers) {{protruding}} from their chins to rifle through the sediments {{in search of a}} meal. Like goats, they seek anything edible: worms, crustaceans, molluscs and other small invertebrates are staples. The yellowfin <b>goatfish</b> (Mulloidichthys vanicolensis) often schools with the blue-striped snapper. The yellowfins change their colouration to match that of the snapper. Presumably this is for predator protection, since <b>goatfish</b> are a more preferred prey than bluestripe snapper. By night the schools disperse and individual <b>goatfish</b> head their separate ways to loot the sands. Other nocturnal feeders shadow the active <b>goatfish,</b> waiting patiently for overlooked morsels.|$|E
50|$|These {{tropical}} benthopelagic <b>goatfishes</b> can {{be found}} mainly in island waters and occur on coral and rocky seaward reefs, over sandy and coral bottoms and in shallow lagoons, {{to a depth of}} 40 - 120 m.|$|R
50|$|These <b>goatfishes</b> {{are usually}} solitary. They feed {{during the day}} on small fish and invertebrates, as gastropods, crabs, {{crustaceans}} (mainly crabs and shrimps), polychaetes and worms, foraminiferans, brittle stars and heart urchins, found {{by means of the}} two barbels.|$|R
5000|$|Mantis shrimps make up over 15 {{percent of}} their diet. Crabs {{are the most common}} item on their diet, and fishes like Bluehead Wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum; Boga, Inermia vittata; <b>goatfishes</b> and small morays are included.3 Preferably, shrimps and octopuses.|$|R
25|$|Goatfishes are {{a family}} Mullidae of about 55 species of perciform fishes, {{associated}} worldwide with tropical reefs. They are typically about 20cm long, though the dash-and-dot <b>goatfish,</b> grows to 55cm. <b>Goatfish</b> are tireless benthic feeders, possess {{a pair of}} long chemosensory barbels ("whiskers") protruding from their chins resembling a goat’s beard. They use these to rifle through the sediments {{in search of a}} meal. Like goats, they seek anything edible; worms, crustaceans, molluscs and other small invertebrates are staples. Many species of <b>goatfish</b> are conspicuously coloured and have the ability to change their colouration depending on their current activity. By day, many form large inactive (non-feeding) schools: these aggregates may contain both conspecifics and heterospecifics. For example, the yellowfin <b>goatfish</b> school with blue-striped snappers. When they do that, the yellowfins changes its colouration to match that of the snapper. By night the schools disperse and individual <b>goatfish</b> head their separate ways to loot the sands. The diurnal goldsaddle <b>goatfish</b> changes from a lemon-yellow to a pale cream when feeding. Other nocturnal feeders will shadow the active <b>goatfish,</b> waiting patiently for overlooked morsels. <b>Goatfish</b> stay within the shallows, going no deeper than about 110 metres. Most species do not tolerate brackish water, so they do not enter estuaries or the mouths of rivers.|$|E
25|$|Pictorial {{evidence}} of Roman fishing comes from mosaics. At {{a certain time}} the <b>goatfish</b> was considered the epitome of luxury, above all because its scales exhibit a bright red color when it dies out of water. For this reason these fish were occasionally allowed to die slowly at the table. There even was a recipe where this would take place in garo, in the sauce. At {{the beginning of the}} Imperial era, however, this custom suddenly came to an end, which is why mullus in the feast of Trimalchio (see the Satyricon) could be shown as a characteristic of the parvenu, who bores his guests with an unfashionable display of dying fish.|$|E
500|$|Small, benthic {{bony fishes}} {{constitute}} over 90% of the marbled electric ray's diet by weight; these include gobies, hake, sea bass, mullets, jack mackerel, sea breams, <b>goatfish,</b> damselfish, wrasses, conger eels, and flatfish. Cephalopods such as European squid (Loligo vulgaris) and elegant cuttlefish (Sepia elegans) are a minor secondary food source. There {{is a single}} record of an individual that had swallowed a penaeid prawn, Penaeus kerathurus, and a study of captive rays found that they reject live Macropodia crabs. Off southern France, {{by far the most}} important prey species is the leaping mullet (Liza saliens). Food items are swallowed whole; there is a record of a ray [...] long that had consumed a three-bearded rockling (Gaidropsarus vulgaris) [...] long.|$|E
50|$|This fish {{reaches up}} to 81cm {{in length and}} 12kg in weight. It is {{distinguished}} by its lunate tail with a yellow-edged margin. As juveniles they resemble the <b>goatfishes</b> Parupeneus forsskali or Parupeneus macronema and may shadow them as they feed.|$|R
50|$|<b>Goatfishes</b> are pelagic spawners; they release many buoyant {{eggs into}} the water which {{become part of the}} plankton. The eggs float freely with the {{currents}} until hatching.The larvae drift in oceania waters or in the outer shelf for a period of 4-8 weeks until they metamorphose and develop barbels. Soon thereafter most species take of bottom-feeding life-style, although other species remain in the open water as juveniles or feed on plankton.Juvenile <b>goatfishes</b> often prefer soft bottoms, in seagrass beds to mangroves. They change habitat preference as they develop, coinciding with changes in feeding habits, social behavior and the formation of association with other species.Most species reach reproductive maturity after one or two years.|$|R

2500|$|In the {{following}} years, fishers and ecologists raised {{concerns that the}} snapper would outcompete other fish for space and food, as well as prey upon them; scientific investigation has not found evidence to support these claims. Snapper may be competitively dominant over native yellow-fin <b>goatfish,</b> Mulloidichthys vanicolensis, for sheltering space on the reef.

50|$|<b>Goatfishes</b> {{have the}} ability to rapidly change color, and many species adopt a pale {{coloration}} when resting on the sand to blend with the background and become less visible to predators.

2500|$|Like many Indo-Pacific carangids, {{the biology}} and {{ecology of the}} blue {{trevally}} is poorly known, with the only data on the species relating to its diet. It is a fast-swimming predator which often forms small schools, and takes a variety of small fish (specifically mackerel and filefish), crustaceans including prawns, crabs, and sea lice, soft molluscs, and other soft prey. In Hawaii, they have been observed following foraging bonefish or <b>goatfish,</b> consuming any scraps uncovered by the foragers. The species {{appears to be in}} constant abundance all year, but ripe individuals have rarely been reported. No information regarding the reproduction and growth of the species is available, although [...] larvae of the species are known to appear during February in the waters off Taiwan, suggesting a December spawning period, and make up a high proportion of the larval abundance. Juveniles are known to sometimes shelter among the tentacles of large pelagic jellyfish.|$|E
2500|$|The bluefin {{trevally}} {{displays a}} remarkable array of hunting techniques, ranging from midwater attacks to ambush and {{taking advantage of}} larger forage fish. The species is reported to hunt during the day, particularly at dawn and dusk in most locations; however it {{is known to be}} a nocturnal feeder in South Africa. The bluefin trevally hunts both as a solitary individual and in groups of up to 20, with most fish preferring an individual approach. In groups, these fish will rush their prey, and disperse the school, allowing for isolated individuals to be picked out and eaten, much in the way the related species, giant trevally have been observed to do in captivity. In some cases, only one individual in a group will attack the prey school. Where the prey is schooling reef fishes, once the prey school has been attacked, the trevally chases down the prey as they scatter back to cover in the corals, often colliding with coral as they attempt to snatch a fish. [...] While hunting in midwater, fish swim both against and with the tide, although significantly more fish hunt when swimming with the tide (i.e. 'downstream'), suggesting some mechanical advantage is gained when hunting in this mode. Another method of attack is ambush; in this mode the trevally change their colour to a dark pigmentation state and hide behind large coral lumps close to where the aggregations (often spawning reef fish) occur. Once the prey is close enough to the hiding spot, the fish ram the base of the school, before chasing down individual fish. These dark fish in ambush mode vigorously drive away any other bluefin trevally that stray too close to the aggregation. Ambushes have also been observed on small midwater planktivorous fishes are moving to or from the shelter of the reef. In many cases, the species uses changes in the depth of the reef such as ledges to conceal its ambush attacks. Bluefin trevally also enter lagoons as the tide rises to hunt small baitfish in the shallow confines, leaving as the tide falls. The species is also known to follow large rays, sharks and other foraging fish such as <b>goatfish</b> and wrasse around sandy substrates, waiting to pounce on any disturbed crustaceans or fish which are flushed out by the larger fish.|$|E
