5|$|Sire, be not grieved nor greatly distressed {{because of}} what has befallen us. It is not on things of wood that the issue hangs for us, but on men and horses...If then you so desire, let us {{straightway}} attack the Peloponnese, or if it pleases you to wait, that also we can do...It is best then that you should do as I have said, {{but if you have}} resolved to lead your army away, <b>even</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> have another plan. Do not, O king, make the Persians the laughing-stock of the Greeks, for if you have suffered harm, it is by no fault of the Persians. Nor can you say that we have anywhere done less than brave men should, and if Phoenicians and Egyptians and Cyprians and Cilicians have so done, it is not the Persians who have any part in this disaster. Therefore, since the Persians are in no way to blame, be guided by me; if you are resolved not to remain, march homewards with the greater part of your army. It is for me, however, to enslave and deliver Hellas to you with three hundred thousand of your host whom I will choose.|$|E
25|$|One of {{his star}} {{students}} was Rabbi Shlomo Wahrman, a tremendous Torah scholar {{who came from}} Leipzig for fifteen years {{and went on to}} becoming principal and Rosh Yeshiva of the Hebrew Academy of Nassau County. Rabbi Wahrman attributes his success to Rabbi Silver’s insistence and encouragement to hone his writing skills and record his copious chidushei Torah. Rabbi Wahrman writes in the short biography he published on Rabbi Silver:I remember at times he screamed at me for lack of understanding-however, <b>even</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> sensed his great love and concern for me and not the slightest hint of hatred. Rabbi Silver was a man whose very essence was giving to others-his ahavas yisroel (love for his fellow Jew) knew no bounds…he saw every Jew as an extension of himself.|$|E
500|$|In November 1821, {{shortly before}} his seventeenth birthday, Disraeli was {{articled}} as a clerk to a firm of solicitors—Swain, Stevens, Maples, Pearse and Hunt—in the City of London. T F Maples {{was not only the}} young Disraeli's employer and friend of his father's, but also his prospective father-in-law: Isaac and Maples entertained the possibility that the latter's only daughter might be a suitable match for Benjamin. A friendship developed, but there was no romance. The firm had a large and profitable business, and as the biographer R W Davis observes, the clerkship was [...] "the kind of secure, respectable position that many fathers dream of for their children". Although biographers including Robert Blake and Bradford comment that such a post was incompatible with Disraeli's romantic and ambitious nature, he reportedly gave his employers satisfactory service, and later professed to have learned a good deal from his time with the firm. He recalled, [...] "I had some scruples, for <b>even</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> dreamed of Parliament. My father's refrain always was 'Philip Carteret Webb', who was the most eminent solicitor of his boyhood and who was an MP. It {{would be a mistake to}} suppose that the two years and more that I was in the office of our friend were wasted. I have often thought, though I have often regretted the University, that it was much the reverse." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Oh! {{that would}} be the {{greatest}} kindness of all! And if it were not presuming too much, if madame would let me take the pattern of that beautiful point lace that she sometimes wears in the <b>evening,</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> should make myself welcome!' ...|$|R

500|$|In {{an early}} promotional interview, Nas {{claimed that the}} name [...] "Illmatic" [...] (meaning [...] "beyond ill" [...] or [...] "the ultimate") was a {{reference}} to his incarcerated Queensbridge friend, Illmatic Ice. Nas later described the title name as [...] "supreme ill. It's as ill as ill gets. That shit is a science of everything ill." [...] At {{the time of its}} recording, expectations in the hip hop scene were high for Illmatic. In a 1994 interview for The Source, which dubbed him [...] "the second coming", Nas spoke highly of the album, saying that [...] "this feels like a big project that's gonna affect the world [...] We in here on the down low [...] doing something for the world. That's how it feels, that's what it is. For all the ones that think it's all about some ruff shit, talkin' about guns all the time, but no science behind it, we gonna bring it to them like this." [...] AZ recounted recording on the album, [...] "I got on Nas' album and did the 'Life's a Bitch' song, but <b>even</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> thought I was terrible on it, to be honest. But once people started hearing that and liking it, that's what built my confidence. I thought, 'OK, I can probably do this.' That record was everything. To be the only person featured on Illmatic when Nas {{is considered one of the}} top men in New York at that time, one of the freshest new artists, that was big." [...] During the sessions, Nas composed the song [...] "Nas Is Like", which he later recorded as a single for his 1999 album I Am….|$|E
2500|$|In 1952, two youths {{attempted}} {{to break into}} a Croydon warehouse: one, Derek Bentley, surrendered to the police but the other, Christopher Craig, shot and killed a police officer. Yet at the trial Bentley was sentenced to death. [...] "My mum knew the Bentleys," [...] McTell recalls. [...] "I was about eight, but <b>even</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> could see the horror and injustice of executing a teenager for a murder he didn't commit." [...] Many years later, McTell expressed that sense of injustice in the song [...] "Bentley & Craig".|$|E
2500|$|She {{was born}} Wanda Gertz von Schliess in Warsaw, the {{daughter}} of Jana and Florentyny Gertz von Schliess. Her family originated in Saxony, but had settled in Poland during the eighteenth century during {{the rule of the}} House of Wettin. Gertz's father had taken part in the January Uprising in 1863-64, and Gertz grew up hearing the stories of her father and his friends. Years later she wrote: [...] "As a five-year-old girl I had never had any dolls, only innumerable toy soldiers, which my older brother, his friends and I played with. <b>Even</b> <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> knew that high rank was not for girls. My fondest dream was to become an officer. However, as a girl I could only be a private." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, even then--it was hard, but <b>even</b> <b>then.</b> Do <b>I</b> not {{eat your}} bread? and shall I take {{advantage}} of you when you have forbid me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not <b>even</b> <b>then,</b> Harry. <b>I</b> {{know you}} will think better of this, when your generous nature has time to reason with your heart, on my account." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>even</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> {{will bear}} my burden till the Lord in His mercy shall see fit to relieve me. <b>Even</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> will endure, though a bare bodkin or a leaf of hemlock would {{put an end}} to it. Let me pass on; you need fear nothing." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Even</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> laughed, sad as I was, {{for truth}} {{lived in the}} {{philosophy}} of Bes.|$|E
60|$|And <b>even</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> did not glance his way. After a {{time his}} voice {{came up from}} the main deck.|$|E
6000|$|... "I did my best," [...] Archie said, [...] "as {{one should}} always do; but <b>I</b> felt <b>even</b> <b>then</b> that <b>I</b> {{would rather have}} been {{fighting}} on foot." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{therefore}} {{you ought to}} take {{him at his word}} and retire. It would be the gentlemanlike thing to do. Of course you'd have the power of going over and seeing that things was straight. And if we was living comfortable at some genteel place, such as Torquay or the like, of course you wouldn't want to be going out to Dragons every <b>evening</b> <b>then.</b> <b>I</b> shouldn't wonder if, in two or three years, you didn't find yourself as strong as ever again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, Gavin," [...] said Margaret, earnestly; [...] "and I {{question}} if I should be satisfied <b>even</b> <b>then.</b> But <b>I</b> am sure I {{should be a}} better guide to you than Dr. McQueen is." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Even</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> did not chide him. He {{could not}} {{know that it was}} I who had dropped the letter.|$|E
60|$|<b>Even</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> {{failed to}} {{understand}} what the old soldier meant, and asked him to explain more fully, which he did.|$|E

60|$|TANNER. No {{man is a}} {{match for}} a woman, except with a poker {{and a pair of}} hobnailed boots. Not always <b>even</b> <b>then.</b> Anyhow, <b>I</b> can't take the poker to her. I should be a mere slave.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, my dear fellow, {{it is at}} {{the hour}} of action that I turn to you for aid. But this is splendid, really unique from some points of view. When you pass Bradley's, would you ask him to send up a pound of the strongest shag tobacco? Thank you. It would be as well if you could make it {{convenient}} not to return before <b>evening.</b> <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> should be very glad to compare impressions as to this most interesting problem which has been submitted to us this morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shan't {{be sure of}} that," [...] I returned, [...] "till I {{know what}} they think! However, I repeat," [...] I added, [...] "that <b>I</b> shouldn't <b>even</b> <b>then</b> care. <b>I</b> don't mind admitting that she much {{interests}} me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Anybody would be,” I said. “I was. I didn’t sleep a wink. I {{was expecting}} to see you soon—and <b>even</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> had my doubts.” ...|$|E
60|$|At times I cast {{myself on}} the sofa and bury my head in the cushions. <b>Even</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> cannot find out why I was born.|$|E

6000|$|I am rather {{sorry we}} expect friends to-day, though these friends be the good Fergusons. I have a humour for work, {{to which the}} sober, sad {{uniformity}} of a snowy day always particularly disposes me, and I am sure I will get poor Gillies off my hand, at least if I had morning and <b>evening.</b> <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> would set to work with arranging everything for these second editions of Napoleon, The Romances, etc., which must be soon got afloat. I must say [...] "the wark gangs bonnily on."[115] Well, I will ring for coals, mend my pen, and try what can be done.|$|R
6000|$|... "So I rose, {{and felt}} <b>even</b> <b>then</b> that <b>I</b> {{who thought that}} every bone in my body must be broken, was {{stronger}} than I had ever been before. It was as though the lamp which had burnt low was filled suddenly with a new and purer oil.|$|R

60|$|But, <b>even</b> <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> saw a face at an archere, an ill {{face and}} fell, the wolf's eyes of Brother Thomas glancing along {{the stock of}} an arbalest.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] {{returned}} the other, sighing: [...] "yes! The same Sydney, {{with the same}} luck. <b>Even</b> <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> did exercises for other boys, and seldom did my own." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just this morning," [...] he insisted, [...] "and I {{think he}} won't trouble you for his fare. You must let me, please. Remember that there's a large account open still between your {{half-brother}} and me, so you needn't mind these trifles.

6000|$|... "She was {{a strange}} girl in some ways <b>even</b> <b>then,</b> but <b>I</b> always liked her, though {{a great many people}} didn't. She had some bitter enemies, but she had some devoted friends too. That was her way. She made folks either hate or love her. Those who did love her would have gone through fire and water for her.|$|R
60|$|A slight noise {{attracted}} my notice, and, {{looking to}} the floor, I saw several enormous rats traversing it. They had issued from the well, which lay just within view to my right. <b>Even</b> <b>then,</b> while <b>I</b> gazed, they came up in troops, hurriedly, with ravenous eyes, allured by {{the scent of the}} meat. From this it required much effort and attention to scare them away.|$|R
