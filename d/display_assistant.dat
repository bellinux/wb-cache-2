40|$|Task-analytic models {{structure}} {{essential information}} about operator interaction with complex systems, {{in this case}} pilot interaction with the autoflight system. Such models serve two purposes: (1) they allow researchers and practitioners to understand pilots' actions; and (2) they provide a compact, computational representation needed to design 'intelligent' aids, e. g., <b>displays,</b> <b>assistants,</b> and training systems. This paper demonstrates {{the use of the}} operator function model to trace the process of mode engagements while a pilot is controlling an aircraft via the, autoflight system. The operator function model is a normative and nondeterministic model of how a well-trained, well-motivated operator manages multiple concurrent activities for effective real-time control. For each function, the model links the pilot's actions with the required information. Using the operator function model, this paper describes several mode engagement scenarios. These scenarios were observed and documented during a field study that focused on mode engagements and mode transitions during normal line operations. Data including time, ATC clearances, altitude, system states, and active modes and sub-modes, engagement of modes, were recorded during sixty-six flights. Using these data, seven prototypical mode engagement scenarios were extracted. One scenario details the decision of the crew to disengage a fully automatic mode in favor of a semi-automatic mode, and the consequences of this action. Another describes a mode error involving updating aircraft speed following the engagement of a speed submode. Other scenarios detail mode confusion at various phases of the flight. This analysis uses the operator function model to identify three aspects of mode engagement: (1) the progress of pilot-aircraft-autoflight system interaction; (2) control/display information required to perform mode management activities; and (3) the potential cause(s) of mode confusion. The goal of this paper is twofold: (1) to demonstrate the use of the operator functio model methodology to describe pilot-system interaction while engaging modes And monitoring the system, and (2) to initiate a discussion of how task-analytic models might inform design processes. While the operator function model is only one type of task-analytic representation, the hypothesis of this paper is that some type of task analytic structure is a prerequisite for the design of effective human-automation interaction...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{findings from}} a study of inter-professional interaction between doctors and nurses in a surgical ward. The {{aim of the research}} is to analyze the construction of gender, profession and hierarchy {{in the context of the}} everyday interactions between members of the professions of nursing and medicine in the hospital. Participant observation was undertaken in two medical and two surgical wards in three hospitals. The present paper provides a microanalysis of ethnographic data in which Erving GOFFMAN's "frame analysis" (1974) is used as a central analytical resource. Gender and profession are interpreted as ongoing accomplishments. Stereotyping impacts of gender and profession are discussed as different "frames," which change or are linked in the social situation. In this particular case, an outspoken nurse is shown as she disrupts the frame of the doctor's rounds by <b>displaying</b> the <b>assistant</b> doctor as an embodied male person, thus "keying" the professional frame in a gender frame. The senior doctor "clears the frame" by making an ambiguous joke. I argue that doing subordination and doing domination in nursing and medicine are enacted by such gender displays. The interpretation shows the "doctor-nurse game" (STEIN, 1967) as a gendered power game. URN: urn:nbn:de: 0114 -fqs 08014...|$|R
40|$|Research on {{helicopter}} noise abatement at DLR {{has led to}} the development of a pilot <b>assistant</b> <b>display</b> for following prescribed noise-optimised landing procedures. An intuitive tunnel-in-the-sky display was chosen in order to reduce pilot workload during complex manoeuvres. The tunnel representation allows the pilot to anticipate the coming flight path. This has led to improvements in flight path accuracy compared to flights with a standard primary flight display with target indicators only. Trajectory generation is performed partly during flight which allows the update of the displayed trajectory relative to the current helicopter position. After selecting the desired noise abatement procedure, landing place and approach direction, a transition trajectory is generated that leads the pilot to the entrance point of the actual procedure. Performance of the tunnel-in-the-sky display has successfully been demonstrated during ground-based simulator tests with two pilots and in first airborne test flights. The display will be used for upcoming flight test campaigns with DLR’s research helicopter ACT/FHS...|$|R
40|$|Activity Plan Generator (APGEN), now at version 5. 0, is a {{computer}} program that assists in generating an integrated plan of activities for a spacecraft mission that does not oversubscribe spacecraft and ground resources. APGEN generates an interactive display, through which the user can easily create or modify the plan. The display summarizes the plan {{by means of a}} time line, whereon each activity is represented by a bar stretched between its beginning and ending times. Activities can be added, deleted, and modified via simple mouse and keyboard actions. The use of resources can be viewed on resource graphs. Resource and activity constraints can be checked. Types of activities, resources, and constraints are defined by simple text files, which the user can modify. In one of two modes of operation, APGEN acts as a planning expert <b>assistant,</b> <b>displaying</b> the plan and identifying problems in the plan. The user is in charge of creating and modifying the plan. In the other mode, APGEN automatically creates a plan that does not oversubscribe resources. The user can then manually modify the plan. APGEN is designed to interact with other software that generates sequences of timed commands for implementing details of planned activities...|$|R
5000|$|He {{was born}} Francis Wilford Smith (without hyphenation) in Rugby, Warwickshire, England, the second son of {{pharmacist}} Wilford Smith and Frances Hunt, who died {{shortly after his}} birth. He attended Warwick School, where he began drawing cartoons, but left {{at the age of}} 16 to train as a radio operator. He joined the Merchant Navy, serving during the Second World War on convoys to Africa and across the Atlantic. During this time he also worked as an undercover courier and agent for US Naval Intelligence, intercepting telephone conversations and collecting and delivering material to US consular staff in the Belgian Congo and Persian Gulf. In 1946, he began attending Camberwell School of Art in London, specialising in illustration and wood engraving. While there, he met and, in 1949, married Pamela Kilby, which led to their collective nickname of [...] "Smilby". He then became an art teacher, and for a time worked as an animator with Halas and Batchelor, before becoming <b>assistant</b> <b>display</b> manager for the women's clothing chain Richard Shops and assistant to the industrial designer Ian Bradbury. However, by 1951, his cartoons had begun appearing in Punch and other magazines, and he became a full-time cartoonist, later working for the Daily Telegraph, Playboy, and many others. From the early 1960s, he also worked widely in Europe and the USA, publishing cartoons in various periodicals including The New Yorker, Esquire, and the Saturday Evening Post.|$|R

However, {{the lack of}} tactile feedback is an essential limiting factor for the further expansion. In robotic surgery, feedback related to touch is currently kinesthetic, and it is mainly aimed at the minimization of force applied to tissues and organs. Design and implementation of diagnostic tactile feedback is still an open problem. We hypothesized that a sufficient tactile feedback in robot-assisted surgery can be provided by utilization of Medical Tactile Endosurgical Complex (MTEC), which is a novel specialized tool that is already commercially available in the Russian Federation. MTEC allows registration of tactile images by a mechanoreceptor, real-time visualization of these images, and reproduction of images via a tactile display. Materials and methods: Nine elective surgeries were performed with da Vinci™ robotic system. An assistant performed tactile examination through an additional port {{under the guidance of}} a surgeon during revision of tissues. The operating surgeon sensed registered tactile data using a tactile <b>display,</b> and the <b>assistant</b> inspected the visualization of tactile data. First, surgeries where lesion boundaries were visually detectable were performed. The goal was to promote cooperation between the surgeon and the assistant and to train them in perception of the tactile feedback. Then, instrumental tactile diagnostics was utilized in case of visually undetectable boundaries. Results: In robot-assisted surgeries where lesion boundaries were not visually detectable, instrumental tactile diagnostics performed using MTEC provided valid identification and localization of lesions. The results of instrumental tactile diagnostics were concordant with the results of intraoperative ultrasound examination. However, in certain cases, for example, thoracoscopy, ultrasound examination is inapplicable, while MTEC-based tactile diagnostics can be efficiently utilized. Conclusion: The study proved that MTEC can be efficiently used in robot-assisted surgery allowing correct localization of visually undetectable lesions and visually undetectable boundaries of pathological changes of tissues.
