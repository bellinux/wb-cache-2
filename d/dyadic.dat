5|$|Infant {{and parent}} {{chimpanzees}} show <b>dyadic</b> joint attention in an affectionate manner {{by looking at}} each other's eyes Non-human animals such as Japanese monkeys, baboons, and other Old World monkeys seldom engage in <b>dyadic</b> joint attention. For these animals, the eye contact involved in <b>dyadic</b> joint attention is deemed threatening.|$|E
5|$|Defining {{levels of}} joint {{attention}} {{is important in}} determining if children are engaging in age-appropriate joint attention. There are three levels of joint attention: triadic, <b>dyadic,</b> and shared gaze.|$|E
5|$|<b>Dyadic</b> joint {{attention}} is a conversation-like behavior that individuals engage in. This {{is especially true}} for human adults and infants, who engage in this behavior starting at two months of age. Adults and infants take turns exchanging facial expressions, noises, {{and in the case of}} the adult, speech.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} {{identify}} intention is critical to joint attention. When individuals understand that others have goals, intentions, and attentional states, {{they are able to}} enter into and direct another's attention. Joint attention promotes and maintains <b>dyadic</b> exchanges and learning about the nature of social partners. The ability to engage in joint attention is crucial for language development.|$|E
5|$|Triadic joint {{attention}} {{is the highest}} level of joint attention and involves two individuals looking at an object. Each individual must understand that the other individual is looking at the same object and realize that {{there is an element of}} shared attention. Triadic {{attention is}} marked by the individual looking back to the other individual after looking at the object. <b>Dyadic</b> joint attention involves mutual gaze between the parent and infant. Mutual gaze is marked by both the parent and infant looking at each other's face. If two individuals are simply looking at an object, it is referred to as shared gaze.|$|E
25|$|Each <b>dyadic</b> {{interval}} is {{spanned by}} two <b>dyadic</b> intervals {{of half the}} length.|$|E
25|$|Each <b>dyadic</b> {{interval}} {{is contained}} in exactly one <b>dyadic</b> interval of twice the length.|$|E
25|$|The {{length of}} a <b>dyadic</b> {{interval}} is always an integer power of two.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, the Canadian firm Telecompute Integrated Systems, Inc. {{released}} a business-oriented APL interpreter known as TIS APL, for Z80-based systems. It featured the {{full set of}} file functions for APL, plus a full screen input and switching of right and left arguments for most <b>dyadic</b> operators by introducing the ~. prefix to all single character <b>dyadic</b> functions such as - or /.|$|E
25|$|The <b>dyadic</b> {{intervals}} consequently have {{a structure}} that reflects that of an infinite binary tree.|$|E
25|$|If two open <b>dyadic</b> {{intervals}} overlap, {{then one}} of them is a subset of the other.|$|E
25|$|Infants develop {{distinct}} {{relationships to}} their mothers, fathers, siblings, and non- familial caregivers. Beside the <b>dyadic</b> attachment relationships {{also a good}} quality of the triadic relationships (mother- father – infant) is important for infant mental health development.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} items in each {{questionnaire}} is variable: 135 items for singles and 173 for people with a partner. The explored dimensions are 16 for singles and 18 for people living a <b>dyadic</b> situation.|$|E
25|$|A 28-item {{questionnaire}} {{which is}} intended to analyse the features of <b>dyadic</b> relationships. It is often used in marriage counselling and couple's therapy. This inventory shows good psychometric features and is often used together with GRISS which is its individual version.|$|E
25|$|The {{programmer}} may define new {{operators and}} both those and the pre-defined ones may be overloaded and their priorities may {{be changed by}} the coder. The following example defines operator max with both <b>dyadic</b> and monadic versions (scanning across the elements of an array).|$|E
25|$|Blue–Red Hackenbush - At {{the finite}} level, this {{partisan}} combinatorial game allows constructions of games whose values are <b>dyadic</b> rational numbers. At the infinite level, it {{allows one to}} construct all real values, {{as well as many}} infinite ones that fall within the class of surreal numbers.|$|E
25|$|A clausula or clausula vera ("true close") is a <b>dyadic</b> or intervallic, {{rather than}} chordal or harmonic, cadence. In a clausula vera two voices {{approach}} an octave or unison through stepwise motion. This {{is also in}} contrary motion. In three voices the third voice often adds a falling fifth creating a cadence similar to the authentic cadence in tonal music.|$|E

25|$|Several {{refineries}} {{that can}} process biomass {{and turn it}} into ethanol are built by companies such as Iogen, POET, and Abengoa, while other companies such as the Verenium Corporation, Novozymes, and <b>Dyadic</b> International are producing enzymes which could enable future commercialization. The shift from food crop feedstocks to waste residues and native grasses offers significant opportunities for a range of players, from farmers to biotechnology firms, and from project developers to investors.|$|E
25|$|In these circumstances, {{reciprocal}} exchange can {{be divided}} in two types: <b>dyadic</b> back-and-forth exchange (reciprocity), and pooling (redistribution). Pooling is a system of reciprocities. It is a within group relationship, whereas reciprocity is a between relationship. Pooling establishes a centre, whereas reciprocity inevitably establishes two distinct parties with their own interests. While the most basic form of pooling is that of food within the family, {{it is also the}} basis for sustained community efforts under a political leader.|$|E
25|$|Cellulosic ethanol commercialization is {{the process}} of {{building}} an industry out of methods of turning cellulose-containing organic matter into fuel. Companies, such as Iogen, POET, and Abengoa, are building refineries that can process biomass and turn it into bioethanol. Companies, such as Diversa, Novozymes, and <b>Dyadic,</b> are producing enzymes that could enable a cellulosic ethanol future. The shift from food crop feedstocks to waste residues and native grasses offers significant opportunities for a range of players, from farmers to biotechnology firms, and from project developers to investors.|$|E
25|$|Maya prayer almost {{invariably}} accompanies acts of offering and sacrifice. It often {{takes the form}} of long litanies, in which the names of personified days, saints, angels (rain and lightning deities), features of the landscape connected with historical or mythical events, and mountains are particularly prominent. Its importance is highlighted by the fact that Maya communities in the northwestern highlands of Guatemala have a specialized group of 'Prayermakers'. Prayers, with their hypnotizing scansion, often show a <b>dyadic</b> couplet structure which has also been recognized in Classic period texts. The earliest prayers recorded in European script are in Quiché, and are embedded in the creation myths of the Popol Vuh.|$|E
25|$|A multi-method, multi-informant {{comparison}} of community samples of committed gay male and lesbian (30 participants each) couples with both committed (50 young engaged and 40 older married participants) and non-committed (109 exclusively dating) opposite-sex pairs {{was conducted in}} 2008. Specifically, in this study the quality of same- and opposite-sex relationships was examined at multiple levels of analysis via self-reports and partner reports, laboratory observations, and measures of physiological reactivity during <b>dyadic</b> interactions. Additionally, individuals in same-sex, engaged, and marital relationships were compared with one another on adult attachment security as assessed through the coherence of participants' narratives about their childhood experiences. Results indicated that individuals in committed same-sex relationships were generally not distinguishable from their committed opposite-sex counterparts.|$|E
25|$|This {{inventory}} {{is made up}} of 125 items, {{subdivided into}} 14 subscales, which explore sexual intercourse, personal difficulties, marital satisfaction, couple cohesion, <b>dyadic</b> adaptability, communication, conflict resolution, equality of the roles, children and marital life, family and friends, financial management, leisure activities, religious orientation, idealistic distortions. This inventory requires an elaborate preparation in order to be used and results from the combination of three previous scales: PREPARE - Premarital Personal and Relationship Evaluation (for couples planning to marry who do not have children); PREPARE-MC - Marriage Children (for couples planning to marry who have children, either together or from previous relationships); ENRICH - Evaluating Nurturing Relationship Issues Communication and Happiness (for married couples seeking empowerment and counselling).|$|E
25|$|Even {{before the}} {{negotiation}} process starts, {{people in a}} positive mood have more confidence, and higher tendencies to plan to use a cooperative strategy. During the negotiation, negotiators {{who are in a}} positive mood tend to enjoy the interaction more, show less contentious behavior, use less aggressive tactics and more cooperative strategies. This in turn increases the likelihood that parties will reach their instrumental goals, and enhance the ability to find integrative gains. Indeed, compared with negotiators with negative or natural affectivity, negotiators with positive affectivity reached more agreements and tended to honor those agreements more. Those favorable outcomes are due to better decision making processes, such as flexible thinking, creative problem solving, respect for others' perspectives, willingness to take risks and higher confidence. Post-negotiation positive affect has beneficial consequences as well. It increases satisfaction with achieved outcome and influences one's desire for future interactions. The PA aroused by reaching an agreement facilitates the <b>dyadic</b> relationship, which brings commitment that sets the stage for subsequent interactions. PA also has its drawbacks: it distorts perception of self performance, such that performance is judged to be relatively better than it actually is. Thus, studies involving self reports on achieved outcomes might be biased.|$|E

At age 3 months, children display joint attention skills by calling to a caregiver when they are not perceivable. When caregiver does not respond in a similar manner, child exhibits a series of responses that were first studied in early 1970s by Edward Tronick in collaboration with pediatrician T. Berry Brazelton at the time when the latter was creating the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale. At age 6 months, infants display joint attentional skills by: ...|$|E
