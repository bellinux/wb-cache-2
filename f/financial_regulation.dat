A single nation with functioning governance, financial regulations, deposit insurance, emergency financing through discount windows, standard accounting practices, and established legal and disclosure procedures, can itself develop and grow a healthy domestic financial system. In a global context however, no central political authority exists which can extend these arrangements globally. Rather, governments have cooperated {{to establish a}} host of institutions and practices that have evolved over time and are referred to collectively as the international financial architecture. Within this architecture, regulatory authorities such as national governments and intergovernmental organizations {{have the capacity to}} influence international financial markets. National governments may employ their finance ministries, treasuries, and regulatory agencies to impose tariffs and foreign capital controls or may use their central banks to execute a desired intervention in the open markets.|$|E

40|$|A {{construction}} project should be administrated systematically {{from its inception}} for successful completion. When a Contractor or a Consultant is selected for a Civil Engineering Project, standard tender procedures are to be followed. When obtaining services for a project an agreement is signed by the Client and the Contractor. This agreement spells out the conditions of contract covering the contract administration requirements. There are standard contracts available so that the parties can use them effectively, easily and efficiently for better results. In Sri Lanka, when public finance is utilised, the <b>Financial</b> <b>Regulations</b> have to be followed in formulating a project. <b>Financial</b> <b>Regulations</b> specify the authority, limits and procedures to be followed when a project is financed by government money. In certain instances standard procedures and <b>Financial</b> <b>Regulations</b> contradict each other thus leading to ambiguity which adversely affect the successful completion of the project. Therefore reviewing of both standard procedures and <b>Financial</b> <b>Regulations</b> {{for the purpose of}} eliminating these differences is of high priority. This research has studied the available Standard Tender Procurement Procedures and Contract Conditions, and has established relevant procedures in tendering and contract administration with due consideration to the practical applications and problems. The research also has identified the <b>Financial</b> <b>Regulations</b> available for the relevant procedures and has established and compared the consistency of <b>Financial</b> <b>Regulations</b> against the established procedures.

40|$|By {{observing the}} economies of China, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States, the article aims to study whether the economies are {{genuinely}} motivated to enhance global <b>financial</b> <b>regulations.</b> Throughout the Great Recession, the G 20 nations have repeatedly declared that reforming international <b>financial</b> <b>regulations</b> {{is a prerequisite for}} stabilizing the global financial system. However, the reality often proves different, as the competing economies face challenges that contradict the national economic interests. A regulatory race to the bottom via global deregulatory pressures {{is one of the many}} examples. Thus, via conducting cross-country analysis, this paper aims to offer a more comprehensive depiction of whether the economic status quo incentivizes the creation of enhanced international <b>financial</b> <b>regulations.</b> In order to answer the question, five different case studies are conducted about the respective countries, which are preceded by an introduction and overall assessment of the economic conditions regarding the five particular economies. Lastly, a conclusion will be made discussing the variables identified from the case studies that could both contradict and support the sustainability of future global <b>financial</b> <b>regulations...</b>|$|R

25|$|In September 2011 Massow set up Pay Me My, {{a trading}} name of Massows Limited, which offered {{customers}} a rebate of 80% of the 'trail' commission paid to their existing advisers if the customer switched their insurance, pension and investment policies {{to the agency}} of Pay Me My, who would take 20% as their fee. Massow defended the business model of the firm from suggestions {{that it would not}} be viable following changes to <b>financial</b> <b>regulation</b> in the UK due to start on 1 January 2013; however, it ceased trading in August 2013 after it announced that its business model was loss making and could not be sustained. The firm informed its clients that, should they choose to remain with the company, all future trail commissions would be retained and not rebated. This action was unpopular with customers, therefore Massow agreed to sell the remaining assets under management to Clubfinance, who would continue rebating the majority of their commission.|$|E

25|$|The Act {{changes the}} {{existing}} regulatory structure, {{by creating a}} number of new agencies (while merging and removing others) in an effort to streamline the regulatory process, increasing oversight of specific institutions regarded as a systemic risk, amending the Federal Reserve Act, promoting transparency, and additional changes. The Act's intentions are to provide rigorous standards and supervision to protect the economy and American consumers, investors and businesses; end taxpayer-funded bailouts of financial institutions; provide for an advanced warning system on the stability of the economy; create new rules on executive compensation and corporate governance; and eliminate certain loopholes that led to the 2008 economic recession. The new agencies are either granted explicit power over a particular aspect of <b>financial</b> <b>regulation,</b> or that power is transferred from an existing agency. All of the new agencies, and some existing ones that are not currently required to do so, are also compelled to report to Congress on an annual (or biannual) basis, to present the results of current plans and explain future goals. Important new agencies created include the Financial Stability Oversight Council, the Office of Financial Research, and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection.|$|E

40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIThere {{is growing}} {{recognition}} that nations {{may need to}} deploy cross-border <b>financial</b> <b>regulations</b> to prevent and mitigate financial crises. Indeed, in December 2012 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreed on a new 'institutional view' that notes how the IMF will begin to recommend that nations deploy cross-border <b>financial</b> <b>regulations</b> in the future. However, many nations have become party to global, regional and bilateral trade and investment treaties that may restrict their ability to deploy such regulations effectively. This article analyzes the cases of two countries currently in negotiation over a Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) : Chile and Malaysia. This article examines {{the extent to which}} each nation has deployed cross-border <b>financial</b> <b>regulations</b> in the past, {{and the extent to which}} they have negotiated the policy space for such regulations in its trade and investment treaties. Finally, this article analyzes the degree to which such measures would be permitted if the TPP's investment provisions looked like the model bilateral investment treaty of the USA. We find that, with some important exceptions, both countries have successfully deployed cross-border <b>financial</b> <b>regulations</b> and have carved out the ability to do so under the World Trade Organization (WTO) and some regional commitments. However, such policy space would be jeopardized if the TPP conformed to the US model rather than arrangements that each country has been able to broker in other arenas...|$|R
