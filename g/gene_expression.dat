40|$|ABSTRACT. Hyperadrenocorticism (HAC) is {{a common}} {{endocrine}} disorder in dogs, in which excess glucocorticoid causes insulin resistance. Disturbance of insulin action {{may be caused by}} multiple factors, including transcriptional modulation of insulin signal molecules which lie downstream of insulin binding to insulin receptors. In this study, <b>gene</b> <b>expressions</b> of insulin signal molecules were examined using neutrophils of the HAC dogs (the untreated dogs and the dogs which had been treated with trilostane). Insulin receptor substrate (IRS) - 1, IRS- 2, phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 -K), protein kinase B/Akt kinase (Akt) - 2 and protein kinase C (PKC) -lambda were analyzed in the HAC dogs and compared with those from normal dogs. The IRS- 1 <b>gene</b> <b>expressions</b> decreased by 37 % and 35 % of the control dogs in the untreated and treated groups, respectively. The IRS- 2 <b>gene</b> <b>expressions</b> decreased by 61 % and 72 %, the PI 3 -K <b>gene</b> <b>expressions</b> decreased by 47 % and 55 %, and the Akt- 2 <b>gene</b> <b>expressions</b> decreased by 45 % and 56 % of the control dogs, similarly. Collectively, <b>gene</b> <b>expressions</b> of insulin signal molecules are suppressed in the HAC dogs, which may partially contribute to the induction of insulin resistance.

40|$|The {{biological}} {{problem of}} identifying the active genes during the cell division process is addressed. The cell division ensures {{the proliferation of}} cells, which is drastically aberrant in cancer cells. The studied genes are described by their expression profiles during the cell division cycle. Commonly, the identification process is a supervised approach based on an a priori set of reference genes, assumed as well-characterizing the cell cycle phases. Each studied gene is then classified by its peak similarity to one pre-specified reference gene. This classical approach suffers from two limitations. On the one hand, {{there is no consensus}} between biologists about the set of reference genes to consider for the identification process. On the other hand, the proximity measures used for <b>genes</b> <b>expression</b> profiles are unjustified and mainly based on the expression values regardless of the <b>genes</b> <b>expression</b> behavior. To identify <b>genes</b> <b>expression</b> profiles, a new adaptive clustering approach is proposed which consists of two main points. First, it allows in an unsupervised way the selection of a well-justified set of reference genes, to be compared with the pre-specified ones. Secondly, it enables the users to learn the appropriate proximity measure to use for <b>genes</b> <b>expression</b> data, a measure which will cover both proximity on values and on behavior. The adaptive clustering method is compared to a correlation-based approach through public and simulated <b>genes</b> <b>expression</b> data. ...|$|R

40|$|Despite intense {{effort in}} basic and {{clinical}} research the {{morbidity and mortality}} of sepsis and septic shock remain high. The impending problem is {{the growing number of}} multiresistent bacteria against most commonly used antibiotics during the last years. Therefore, the challenge is to develop synthetic peptide-based drugs on the basis of naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides as new ant-infective agents in order to effectively treat septic patients. The synthetic antimicrobial peptide 19. 2 - 5 shows anti-inflammatory activity against bacteria and viruses and protects mice from lethal septic shock in vivo. Heparanase and the heparan sulfat protoeoglycans syndecan- 1 and perlecan are ubiquitary expressed and play important roles in inflammatory reactions. The regulation of their <b>gene</b> <b>expressions</b> in polymicrobial sepsis is still uninvestigated. Aim {{of this study was to}} answer the following questions: 1) Are the <b>gene</b> <b>expressions</b> of heparanase, syndecan- 1 and perlecan regulated in polymicrobial sepsis in a murine model? 2) Does peptide 19. 2 - 5 influence the <b>gene</b> <b>expressions</b> of heparanase, syndecan- 1 and perlecan in sepsis in an anti-inflammatory manner? 3) Do peptide 19. 2 - 5 and the peptide antibioticum polymyxin B differ in the influence on <b>gene</b> <b>expressions</b> of heparanase, syndecan- 1 and perlecan? 4) Does the therapy with peptide 19. 2 - 5 lead to suppression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in plasma?The experimental trial was structured in four parts: 40 male NMRI mice were randomized to the following four groups: (i) sham operation and NaCl 0. 9 % administration (sham); (ii) sepsis induction and NaCl 0. 9 % administration (sepsis-control); (iii) sepsis induction and infusion of the synthetic antimicrobial peptide 19. 2 - 5 (peptide 19. 2 - 5) or (iv) sepsis induction and polymyxin B infusion (polymyxin B). In the first part all animals underwent venous catheterization for continuously i. v. application of fluids and drugs in general anesthesia. After resting in the cage for 48 h the induction of the sepsis by cecal ligation and puncture in general anesthesia and the i. v. administration of fluids and drugs followed in the second part. After 24 hours of sepsis all animals were killed. In the third part lung, liver, spleen, heart and kidney were harvested as well as blood was sampled and frozen until measurement. During the fourth part <b>gene</b> <b>expressions</b> of heparanase, syndecan- 1 and perlecan were measured in real time PCR and determination of plasma cytokine levels were performed using a cytometric bead array. Taken together the results of this study are: 1) <b>Gene</b> <b>expressions</b> of heparanase, syndecan- 1 and perlecan are regulated during polmymicrobial sepsis in a pro-inflammatory manner. There is a statistically significant upregulation of heparanase in kidney, syndecan- 1 in lung and perlecan in lung and kidney. 2) Administration of peptide 19. 2 - 5 influences the <b>gene</b> <b>expressions</b> of heparanase, syndecan- 1 and perlecan in sepsis in an anti-inflammatory manner. Compared to sepsis without specific treatment the administration of peptide 19. 2 - 5 shows a statistically significant difference in the regulation of <b>gene</b> <b>expressions</b> of heparanase, syndecan- 1 and perlecan in all organs except heparanase in the liver. 3) Peptide 19. 2 - 5 and polymyxin B do not statistically significantly differ in the influence on <b>gene</b> <b>expressions</b> of heparanase, syndecan- 1 and perlecan. 4) Parallel to the regulation of the <b>gene</b> <b>expressions</b> of heparanase, syndecan- 1 and perlecan peptide 19. 2 - 5 supresses statistically significantly the plasma levels of TNF-alpha, IL- 6, IL- 10 und MCP- 1. Using a widely used mouse model of polymicrobial sepsis, the present study analyses a regulation of <b>gene</b> <b>expressions</b> of heparanase, syndecan- 1 and perlecan during polmymicrobial sepsis in several organs in a pro-inflammatory manner.
