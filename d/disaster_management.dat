40|$|This PhD thesis {{develops}} a comprehensive <b>disaster</b> risk <b>management</b> framework that is tailor-made for the strategic <b>management</b> of <b>disasters</b> in Bangladesh. It provides a background {{study of the}} concept of <b>disaster</b> risk <b>management</b> and its components and focuses on key <b>disaster</b> risk <b>management</b> issues associated with both international best practice and in the context of Bangladesh. To address this task, the research focuses on three main questions: i. Based on the critical analysis of existing international frameworks and national policy documents, what are their relevant features {{for the development of a}} <b>disaster</b> risk <b>management</b> framework for Bangladesh? ii. Based on the perception of the individuals who are affected by disasters and who are involved in the <b>disaster</b> risk <b>management</b> processes in Bangladesh, what components are required for an effective <b>disaster</b> risk <b>management</b> framework for Bangladesh? and iii. Based on the internationally existing knowledge base and local inputs, what components in combination should be incorporated in a comprehensive <b>disaster</b> risk <b>management</b> framework for Bangladesh? In order to answer these questions, this research adopts the theoretical approach of social constructivism that recognises disasters as socially constructed phenomena. Therefore, <b>disaster</b> risk <b>management</b> should be approached through an understanding of social and cultural processes, where the affected community members and others who are also involved in the process determine the basic constructs of <b>disaster</b> risk <b>management.</b> Using a qualitative research design most suited for the investigation of a complex phenomenon such as disaster, this research first explores the international development {{of the concept of}} <b>disaster</b> risk <b>management</b> and its components. It analyses the international, regional and national <b>disaster</b> risk <b>management</b> frameworks that have a potential influence on, or relevance for, Bangladesh. It explores the concept of <b>disaster</b> risk <b>management</b> and its components based on empirical data from field research in Bangladesh. Finally, based on the theoretical knowledge base created through the analysis of existing frameworks and the socio-cultural perspectives derived from field research, it {{develops a}} Comprehensive Framework for <b>Disaster</b> Risk <b>Management</b> for Bangladesh (CFDRMB). Furthermore, it develops qualitative benchmarks and process maps to guide the implementation of the framework. This framework will assist professionals and academics who are involved in the <b>disaster</b> risk <b>management</b> process and who are keen to implement <b>disaster</b> risk <b>management</b> programmes or projects more effectively, both in Bangladesh and elsewhere. The research significantly contributes to the body of knowledge that currently exists on <b>disaster</b> risk <b>management</b> in Bangladesh and internationally. This study is the first of its kind in Bangladesh to analyse the specific components that contribute to <b>disaster</b> risk <b>management</b> through a comprehensive framework developed using content analysis of existing frameworks and local-level insights of affected populations and practitioners. Thus, this thesis is a useful resource for engaged <b>disaster</b> risk <b>management</b> practitioners and researchers, because it presents a range of discourses of <b>disaster</b> risk <b>management</b> and details the generic components required for <b>disaster</b> risk <b>management</b> as a whole and specifically in the context of Bangladesh...|$|R

Two light helicopters in Mahajanga and Sambava were dispatched to support two planes in providing assistance to affected populations. Médecins Sans Frontières(MSF) also provided food and medical aid. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) served as a channel for donations to relief efforts, and also made available US$50,000from the United Kingdom's Department for International Development(DFID) for immediate relief purposes. Although the Red Cross had appealed for relief materials for Madagascar before Hudah had hit, these materials would arrive in April, assisting residents affected by Hudah and serving as a backbone for a long-term rehabilitation plan. Due to inclement weather, surveys by humanitarian organizations on the island were not conducted until April4, a full two days after Hudah first struck the island. A Malagasy aircraft delived 6tonnes (6.6metric tons) of rice along with packages of other various supplies to affected regions. The CNS planned to deliver 10tonnes (11short tons) of rice to Antalaha. Although initial reports indicated that 24people were killed due to Hudah, later reports raised the death toll in Madagascar to 111.|$|E

40|$|India {{is one of}} {{the most}} disaster-prone {{countries}} in the South Asian region with intensive vulnerabilities to various man-made and natural disasters. After the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004, there was a paradigm shift in India from a reactive disaster governance approach to a more proactive one which emphasised disaster prevention, mitigation and preparedness. However, there have been several ambiguities regarding the role, capacity and capability of the civil authorities and the armed forces in <b>disaster</b> risk <b>management</b> in India. Thus, this paper (1) examines the current state of <b>disaster</b> risk <b>management</b> in India and (2) critically analyses the role of civil authorities and the armed forces in <b>disaster</b> risk <b>management.</b> It also proposes solutions to improve disaster governance in which both state and non-state actors should be involved in this process. This study is significant for being interdisciplinary in nature since it (1) includes research studies on governance, <b>disaster</b> risk <b>management</b> and non-state participation and (2) covers various issues associated with all stages of a <b>disaster</b> risk <b>management</b> process, i. e. pre-disaster preparedness, disaster relief and post-disaster recovery and reconstruction...|$|R
5|$|The {{flooding}} on Mangaia persisted {{for nearly}} a week before finally subsiding. Once the waters receded, {{the full extent of}} damage was revealed. Although only minor structural damage was sustained, the agricultural sector received extensive losses. Nearly 90% of the islands' staple crop was lost and about 60% of all the livestock perished. Following an assessment made by the Cook Islands National <b>Disaster</b> <b>Management</b> Council, it was determined that US$52,000 was needed to repair losses from Trina. International assistance from the United Nations was eventually requested on December12, allowing for relief funds from several agencies to be delivered to the area. Fears of food shortages also prompted the local government to begin stockpiling food should it become a necessary relief supply. A total of US$24,140 was committed in relief funds by New Zealand, Norway and the United Nations to assist the Cook Islands in recovering from the storm. By late-December, an additional F$20,000 (US$11,000) was distributed by the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat to the affected islands. In the months following Cyclone Trina, debris removal and cleanup was relatively slow, delaying efforts to replant crops lost in the floods. Food shortage issues became apparent in February 2002, prompting the IFRC to distribute food to all of Mangaia's residents.|$|E
