40|$|AbstractIndonesia {{needs at}} least 1, 100 tons of {{alginate}} {{per year for}} various food and non-food industries with a value of about 420, 000 US Dollars.

40|$|Abstract: Fucoxanthin is {{the main}} {{carotenoid}} produced in brown algae {{as a component of}} the light-harvesting complex for photosynthesis and photoprotection. In contrast to the complete elucidation of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathways in red and green algae, the biosynthetic pathway of fucoxanthin in brown algae is not fully understood. Recently, two models for the fucoxanthin biosynthetic pathway have been proposed in unicellular diatoms; however, there is no such information for the pathway in <b>brown</b> <b>seaweeds</b> to date. Here, we propose a biosynthetic pathway for fucoxanthin in the <b>brown</b> <b>seaweed,</b> Ectocarpus siliculosus, derived from comparison of carotenogenic genes in its sequenced genome with those in the genomes of two diatoms, Thalassiosira pseudonana and Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Currently, fucoxanthin is receiving attention, due to its potential benefits for human health. Therefore, new knowledge regarding the medical and nutraceutical properties of fucoxanthin from <b>brown</b> <b>seaweeds</b> is also summarized here...|$|R

The SC-CO 2 method was used at {{a temperature of}} 45 °C and pressure of 250 bar. The flow rate of CO 2 (27 g/min) was constant for the entire extraction period of 2 h. The obtained oil from the <b>brown</b> <b>seaweeds</b> was analyzed to determine their valuable compounds such as fatty acids, phenolic compounds, fucoxanthin and biological properties including antioxidant, antimicrobial, and antihypertension effects. The amounts of fucoxanthin extracted from the SC-CO 2 oils of S. japonica and S. horneri were 0. 41 ± 0. 05 and 0. 77 ± 0. 07 mg/g, respectively.
