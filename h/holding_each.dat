500|$|The {{design of}} a Wing Coaster differs from many {{traditional}} steel roller coasters in that its trains are not located above or below the track but rather on the sides, a configuration that give riders the impression of free flight.

Instead of simply having the traditional over-the-shoulder restraint bar used on many inverted roller coasters, the Wing Coaster restraints similar to Bolliger & Mabillard's Flying Coaster which includes a [...] "cover" [...] and a waist-level restraint, with bars on the side for the rider to hold on to. The Wing Coaster's differences extended to the station layout of the station, which requires the queue to split in two halves, allowing riders to board the train where the seats sit level with the track.|$|E
