5|$|<b>If</b> <b>someone</b> {{has been}} {{diagnosed}} with HIT, some recommend routine Doppler sonography of the leg veins to identify deep vein thromboses, as this is very common in HIT.|$|E
5|$|Screening for aneurysms is not {{performed}} on a population level; {{because they are}} relatively rare, {{it would not be}} cost-effective. <b>If</b> <b>someone</b> has two or more first-degree relatives who have had an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, screening may be worthwhile.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{profiling}} is {{also used}} in DNA paternity testing to determine <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> is the biological parent or grandparent {{of a child with}} the probability of parentage is typically 99.99% when the alleged parent is biologically related to the child. Normal DNA sequencing methods happen after birth, but there are new methods to test paternity while a mother is still pregnant.|$|E
50|$|Artificial {{body parts}} can be, for example, {{attached}} on or under autos (to pretend as <b>if</b> <b>someone's</b> lost a limb after they're run over).|$|R
25|$|Traditionally {{there was}} little {{difference}} between the Christian name ("doopnaam") and the name used in domestic spheres ("roepnaam"). <b>If</b> <b>someone's</b> Christian name was Johannes, domestically he was called Johan, Jan or Hans.|$|R
5000|$|The {{title of}} the album {{consists}} of a meaningless phrase made solely of four grammatical Chinese particles from Classical Chinese. The phrase functions as an adjective; <b>if</b> <b>someone's</b> Chinese is [...] "Zhi hu zhe ye", it means it is stale and archaic.|$|R
5|$|Momoko is a {{childhood}} friend and classmate {{in junior high school}} of Chizuru; she is nicknamed Momo. She constantly hangs around Chizuru and is visibly annoyed when Chizuru socializes with others, or even <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> simply sits too close to her. Momoko inevitably starts fighting Saori, who does not particularly respect Chizuru, when they talk.|$|E
5|$|Severe {{disease is}} more common in babies and young children, and in {{contrast}} to many other infections, it {{is more common}} in children who are relatively well nourished. Other risk factors for severe disease include female sex, high body mass index, and viral load. While each serotype can cause the full spectrum of disease, virus strain is a risk factor. Infection with one serotype is thought to produce lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term protection against the other three. The risk of severe disease from secondary infection increases <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> previously exposed to serotype DENV-1 contracts serotype DENV-2 or DENV-3, or <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> previously exposed to DENV-3 acquires DENV-2. Dengue can be life-threatening in people with chronic diseases such as diabetes and asthma.|$|E
5|$|At least 802 prisoners {{attempted}} {{to escape from}} the Auschwitz camps, mostly Polish or Soviet prisoners fleeing from work sites outside the camp. 144 were successful. The fates of 331 of the escapees are unknown. A common punishment for escape attempts was death by starvation; the families of successful escapees were sometimes arrested and interned in Auschwitz and prominently displayed to deter others. <b>If</b> <b>someone</b> did manage to escape, the SS picked ten people at random from the prisoner's block and starved them to death.|$|E
30|$|The ḥad {{punishment}} is given {{on the basis}} of two things; first, a confession (by the offender); (and second), when there are two male witnesses. The ḥad punishment shall not be inflicted, <b>if</b> <b>someone’s</b> mouth just smells of alcohol, that is, he (the man) shall not be sentenced (Fang 1976).|$|R
2500|$|The accent mark (here {{called the}} print symbol indicator) is used with {{punctuation}} when it stands alone, rather than suffixed to {{a word or}} number. For example, <b>if</b> <b>someone's</b> response in a dialogue is transcribed , in braille that would be written [...] It {{is also used to}} derive a few symbols: % , $ , & [...]|$|R
50|$|Each {{show had}} a themed hashtag that {{listeners}} could use on Twitter {{to share their}} experiences on the topic. For example, #FoodFails, where people gave their negative experiences on cooking. <b>If</b> <b>someone's</b> experience is particularly interesting or humorous, the producers of the show would allow that listener to call in and explain it to Dan and Phil.|$|R
5|$|Behavior theorists see delaying {{gratification}} as {{an adaptive}} skill. It {{has been shown}} that learning to delay gratification promotes positive social behavior, such as sharing and positive peer interactions. For example, students who learn to delay gratification are better able to complete their assigned activities. To put it simply, <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> undertakes an activity with the promise of a delayed reward after, the task's completion becomes more likely.|$|E
5|$|Curtiss {{refused to}} pay license fees to the Wrights and sold an {{airplane}} equipped with ailerons to the Aeronautic Society of New York in 1909. The Wrights filed a lawsuit, beginning a years-long legal conflict. They also sued foreign aviators who flew at U.S. exhibitions, including the leading French aviator Louis Paulhan. The Curtiss people derisively suggested that <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> jumped {{in the air and}} waved his arms, the Wrights would sue.|$|E
5|$|Diagnostic imaging by CT scan and MRI is {{recommended}} after a first non-febrile seizure to detect structural problems {{in and around}} the brain. MRI is generally a better imaging test except when bleeding is suspected, for which CT is more sensitive and more easily available. <b>If</b> <b>someone</b> attends the emergency room with a seizure but returns to normal quickly, imaging tests may be done at a later point. If a person has a previous diagnosis of epilepsy with previous imaging, repeating the imaging is usually not needed even if there are subsequent seizures.|$|E
60|$|The Emperor {{longed for}} {{something}} to come and relieve the monotony of this deathlike stillness. <b>If</b> only <b>someone</b> would speak to him! <b>If</b> only <b>someone</b> would sing to him. Music would carry his thoughts away, and would break the spell lying on him. The moon was streaming in at the open window; but that, too, was silent, quite silent.|$|R

50|$|She {{pointed out}} that if obscene {{contents}} {{are found in the}} app, authorities would punish them and force them to improve the app based on the law. Dealers are responsible for the incidents about app 17. <b>If</b> <b>someone’s</b> views increase drastically, dealers should check immediately and block the account if indecent contents are found. She also said the police should investigate officially and take actions about this app.|$|R
5|$|Genetics {{play a role}} in the {{development}} of COPD. It is more common among relatives of those with COPD who smoke than unrelated smokers. Currently, the only clearly inherited risk factor is alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency (AAT). This risk is particularly high <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> deficient in alpha 1-antitrypsin also smokes. It is responsible for about 1–5% of cases and the condition is present in about 3–4 in 10,000 people. Other genetic factors are being investigated, of which there are likely to be many.|$|E
5|$|<b>If</b> <b>someone</b> {{is found}} guilty of an attempt, they are sentenced under section 4(1) of the 1981 Act. This {{provides}} that anyone who attempts to commit an offence will be punished with {{the same period in}} prison as if they had succeeded; since theft carries a maximum penalty of seven years in prison, for example, someone convicted of attempted theft would also find themselves sentenced to a maximum of seven years.|$|E
5|$|In HIT, the {{platelet}} {{count in the}} blood falls below the normal range, a condition called thrombocytopenia. However, it is generally not low enough to lead to {{an increased risk of}} bleeding. Most people with HIT will therefore not experience any symptoms. Typically the {{platelet count}} will fall 5–14 days after heparin is first given; <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> has received heparin in the previous three months, the fall in platelet count may occur sooner, sometimes within a day.|$|E
50|$|The Spatial Model {{attempts}} {{to show the}} perceptions and decisions of voters when issue voting strategies are used in elections. This model assumes that <b>if</b> <b>someone’s</b> issue preferences are placed on a hypothetical spatial field along with all possible candidates’ policy positions, the individual will vote for the candidate whose political stances are closest to their own. Other models that follow the idea of “closeness” are called proximity models.|$|R

The one who discovers a secret wins a reward, the one who gets his secret revealed gets punished in nominations. Each week, during the main [...] "gala" [...] show, there is an [...] "assembly of secrets".|$|R
5000|$|He rarely {{referred}} {{to himself as}} the Lone Ranger. <b>If</b> <b>someone's</b> suspicion were aroused, the Lone Ranger would present one of his silver bullets to confirm his identity; but many times someone else would attest on his behalf. The origin of this name was, following the Bryant's Gap ambush, Tonto observed {{him to be the}} only ranger left—the [...] "lone ranger"; Tonto's choice of words inspired him to call himself [...] "The Lone Ranger".|$|R
5|$|The {{illness of}} Augustus in 23BC brought {{the problem of}} {{succession}} {{to the forefront of}} political issues and the public. To ensure stability, he needed to designate an heir to his unique position in Roman society and government. This was to be achieved in small, undramatic, and incremental ways that did not stir senatorial fears of monarchy. <b>If</b> <b>someone</b> was to succeed Augustus' unofficial position of power, he would have to earn it through his own publicly proven merits.|$|E
5|$|A {{preventative}} procedure (thoracotomy or thoracoscopy with pleurodesis) may be recommended {{after an}} episode of pneumothorax, with the intention to prevent recurrence. Evidence on the most effective treatment is still conflicting in some areas, and there is variation between treatments available in Europe and the US. Not all episodes of pneumothorax require such interventions; the decision depends largely on estimation {{of the risk of}} recurrence. These procedures are often recommended after the occurrence of a second pneumothorax. Surgery may need to be considered <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> has experienced pneumothorax on both sides ("bilateral"), sequential episodes that involve both sides, or if an episode was associated with pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|Each pupil is {{assigned}} to one of the six houses upon joining the school, and a pupil's house can be indicated to others by optional colour-related clothing. <b>If</b> <b>someone</b> joins as the second in their direct family to do so, they are put in the same house as their relative. There are inter-house competitions throughout the year (including rugby, hockey, reading, and chess) and then {{at the end of the}} year the points awarded in each event throughout the year are added up, and the house with most points is awarded the Cock House Cup, which is the traditional name given in British public schools for the in-school competition cup.|$|E

5|$|Heparin-induced {{thrombocytopenia}} (HIT) is {{the development}} of thrombocytopenia (a low platelet count), due to the administration of various forms of heparin, an anticoagulant. HIT predisposes to thrombosis (the abnormal formation of blood clots inside a blood vessel) because platelets release microparticles that activate thrombin, thereby leading to thrombosis. When thrombosis is identified the condition is called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT). HIT is caused by the formation of abnormal antibodies that activate platelets. <b>If</b> <b>someone</b> receiving heparin develops new or worsening thrombosis, or if the platelet count falls, HIT can be confirmed with specific blood tests.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Lone Hvass of the Elsinore Museum, Miranda Aldhouse-Green of Cardiff University, and the Department of Forensic Science at the University of Århus {{performed}} a re-examination of the Haraldskær Woman. Forensic analysis revealed stomach contents of unhusked millet and blackberries. Her neck had a faint groove as <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> applied a rope for torture or strangulation. The scientists concluded bog acids caused the {{swelling of the}} knee joint and that the woman was probably already dead before the branches pinned her down. Because of her careful placement, and since cremation was the prevailing mode of interment during that period in Jutland, the examiners guess the Haraldskær Woman {{was a victim of}} ritual sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|Laurence succeeded Augustine to the see of Canterbury {{in about}} 604, and ruled {{until his death}} on 2February 619. To secure the succession, Augustine had consecrated Laurence before he died, even though that was {{prohibited}} by canon law. Augustine was afraid though that <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> did not step into the office immediately, it would damage the missionary efforts in Britain. However, Laurence never received a pallium from Rome, so {{he may have been}} considered uncanonical by the papacy. Bede makes a point of comparing Augustine's action in consecrating Laurence to Saint Peter's action of consecrating Clement as Bishop of Rome during Peter's lifetime, which the theologian J. Robert Wright believes may be Bede's way of criticising the practices of the church in his day.|$|E
50|$|One {{advantage}} of passwords over biometrics {{is that they}} can be re-issued. If a token or a password is lost or stolen, it can be cancelled and replaced by a newer version. This is not naturally available in biometrics. <b>If</b> <b>someone's</b> face is compromised from a database, they cannot cancel or reissue it. Cancelable biometrics is a way in which to incorporate protection and the replacement features into biometrics to create a more secure system. It was first proposed by Ratha et al.|$|R
5000|$|For example, <b>if</b> <b>someone's</b> brain {{predicts the}} {{presence}} of a snake as well as the unpleasant affect that would result upon encountering a snake, that brain might categorize and construct an experience of [...] "fear."
