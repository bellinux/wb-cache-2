50|$|Tablets need to {{be strong}} enough to resist the {{stresses}} of packaging, shipping and handling by the pharmacist and patient. The mechanical strength of tablets is assessed using a combination of (i) simple failure and erosion tests, and (ii) more sophisticated engineering tests. The simpler tests are often used for quality control purposes, whereas the more complex tests are used during the design of the formulation and manufacturing process in the research and development phase. Standards for tablet properties are published in the various international pharmacopeias (USP/NF, EP, JP, etc.). The hardness of tablets is the principle measure of mechanical strength. Hardness is tested using a tablet <b>hardness</b> <b>tester.</b> The units for hardness have evolved since the 1930s, but are commonly measured in kilograms per square centimeter.

Although the SC is arbitrary, it was recognized as the international standard from the 1950s to the 1980s. 1 Strong-Cobb represented roughly 0.7 kilogram of force or about 7 newtons.

50|$|The Rockwell {{scale is}} a {{hardness}} scale based on indentation hardness of a material. The Rockwell test determines the hardness {{by measuring the}} depth of penetration of an indenter under a large load compared to the penetration made by a preload. There are different scales, denoted by a single letter, that use different loads or indenters. The result is a dimensionless number noted as HRA, HRB, HRC, etc., where the last letter is the respective Rockwell scale (see below).When testing metals, indentation hardness correlates linearly with tensile strength.

40|$|Abstract- Methods for {{hardness}} measurement on elastomers {{are characterized by}} a set-up where indenters with various defined geometries are pressed under defined test forces into the surface of testing material. The hardness value represents {{the resistance of the}} material to the rigid indenter and is calculated from the indentation depth of the indenter in the to be tested material. The test methods IRHD and Shore are the most common methods used in the field of rubber {{hardness measurement}}s. Appropriate hardness measuring instruments are spread world wide. A periodic verification has to be carried out to assure the accuracy of these measuring instruments. Direct and indirect verification methods are recommended to be used. For the indirect method rubber hardness reference blocks are used. This indirect verification method is especially appropriate for the daily check of hand held rubber <b>hardness</b> <b>testers.</b> On the other side the direct verification of test force, depth measuring system and indenter geometry is suited for the periodic calibration of rubber <b>hardness</b> <b>testers.</b> For the rubber hardness reference blocks their accurate hardness reference value and the long-term stability are the most important characteristics. In this paper the long-term behaviour of hardness of rubber blocks which at present are available on the market and are made by different producers is presented. For the measurements the Shore and IRHD hardness standard devices in the PTB have been used. In order to determine the relationship between hardness and time under the specified conditions a regression analysis of the obtained measurement results was carried out. The results of this analysis can be used for the improvement of quality assurance systems in the field of rubber hardness measurements...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the submitted paper is to analyze {{the influence of the}} load on the calibration of micro-hardness and <b>hardness</b> <b>testers.</b> The results were validated by Measurement Systems Analysis (MSA), Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Z-score. The relationship between the load and micro-hardness in calibration of micro-hardness testers cannot be explained by Kick’s Law (Meyer’s index “n ” is different from 2). The conditions of Kick’s Law are satisfied at macro-hardness calibration, the values of “n ” are close to 2, regardless of the applied load. The apparent micro-hardness increases with the increase of the load up to 30 g; the reverse indentation size effect (ISE) behavior is typical for this interval of the loads.

The experiments focused on five different areas that may affect the components hardness, welding method, soaking temperature during post weld heat treatment, measuring procedure, component thickness and number of heat treatment cycles. The Grade 91 steel specimens that were examined consisted of five solid cylinders and three various pipes that were welded together by using shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) or gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW).

40|$|ABSTRACT: There are {{few studies}} showing the {{industrial}} application of boron compounds. In this study, boron compounds {{are used as}} fillers in plastic materials {{in order to increase}} the use of these raw materials. The effect of anhydrous borax mineral in the thermomechanical and tribologic properties of both calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) unfilled and CaCO 3 filled polypropylene (PP) mate-rial is investigated. Wear and thermomechanical properties of specialized PP material containing additives are examined by using pin-on disc wear tester, DSC, TMA and Shore D <b>hardness</b> <b>testers.</b> This study is the first to use boron (anhydrous borax) compounds as an additive in industrial plastics. As a consequence of the increase in the amount of boron in the samples, the friction coefficient also increases. An increase in the amount of CaCO 3 used as an additive in the samples containing the same percentage of boron reduces the friction coefficient. Using anhydrous borax and CaCO 3 as additives in a natural PP material did not create a considerable change in the crystalline melting temperature of the material. Weight loss increases for anhydrous borax, while it decreases for CaCO 3 compared with natural PPB. If the amount of anhydrous borax is increased, the weight loss increases too. The minimum weight loss is seen for 10 % CaCO 3. This increases with an increas-ing amount of CaCO 3 and is close to natural PPB.

METHODOLOGY: Sixty specimens were prepared; 15 specimens of each material (each group n = 5, control after 15 days, at-home and in-office). All specimens were stored in distilled water at room temperature for 24 hrs before testing. A universal testing machine (Micromet 2100 series micro <b>hardness</b> <b>testers)</b> was used for testing Vicker's surface hardness for the three groups for every tested material. All results were statistically analyzed with one way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Post hoc Tukey HSD tests (P < 0. 05), and percentage changes for Tukey. RESULTS: All the tested materials showed an increase in Vicker's surface hardness between base line (24 hrs) and the control group after 15 days storage in distilled water except DY which showed a decrease in surface hardness. All tested materials showed a decrease in surface hardness from control group after 15 days and both at-home and in-office bleaching agents except DY which showed increased values. SIGNIFICANCE: At-home as well as in-office bleaching agents have a softening effect on some tooth colored restorative material, and the patient must be aware before using them.
