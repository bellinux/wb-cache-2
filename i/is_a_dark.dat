5|$|Donen's {{next film}} was Kiss Them for Me. He was {{personally}} asked by Cary Grant to direct and began developing it while still under contract at MGM. With a plot that strongly resembles On the Town, the film features Grant, Ray Walston and Larry Blyden as three navy officers on leave in San Francisco in 1944. Unlike On the Town, Kiss Them for Me <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> comedy that contrasts the officers' selfless heroism with their self-absorbed hedonism while on leave. The film {{was released in}} 1957 to mostly poor reviews.|$|E

5|$|Juvenile Caribbean reef {{sharks are}} preyed upon by larger sharks {{such as the}} tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) and the bull shark (C. leucas). Few parasites are known for this species; one <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> {{variegated}} leech often seen trailing from its first dorsal fin. Off northern Brazil, juveniles seek out cleaning stations occupied by yellownose gobies (Elacatinus randalli), which clean the sharks of parasites while they lie still on the bottom. Horse-eye jacks (Caranx latus) and bar jacks (Carangoides ruber) routinely school around Caribbean reef sharks.|$|E
5|$|Of the subspecies, the black-faced impala is {{significantly}} larger and {{darker than the}} common impala; melanism {{is responsible for the}} black colouration.

Other differences include the larger black tip on the ear, and a bushier and nearly 30% longer tail in the black-faced impala.|$|E

The wooden beams and rafters have been shown by carbon dating to be original, and the Newari door frames, columns and finials dating to the seventh and eighth centuries were brought from the Kathmandu Valley of Nepal.|$|E
5|$|The L134/L183 <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> nebula complex that, {{along with}} a third cloud, is likely formed by {{fragments}} of a single original cloud located 36 degrees away from the galactic plane, a large distance for dark nebulae. The entire complex {{is thought to be}} around 140 parsecs distant. L183, also referred to as L134N, is home to several infrared sources, indicating pre-stellar sources thought to present the first known observation of the contraction phase between cloud cores and prestellar cores. The core is split into three regions, with a combined mass of around 25 solar masses.|$|E
5|$|The {{planetary}} nebula NGC 5315 has a magnitude of 9.8 around a central star of magnitude 14.2, located 5.2degrees west-southwest of Alpha Circini. It is only visible as a disc at magnifications over 200-fold. Bernes 145 <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> and reflection nebula first {{listed in the}} 1971 Bernes Catalog. The dark nebula component is easily visible in a large amateur telescope, and it measures 12by5arcminutes. The smaller reflection nebula component requires a larger instrument and averted vision to be seen.|$|E

5|$|Although cadmium {{usually has}} an {{oxidation}} state of +2, it also {{exists in the}} +1 state. Cadmium and its congeners are not always considered transition metals, in {{that they do not}} have partly filled d or f electron shells in the elemental or common oxidation states. Cadmium burns in air to form brown amorphous cadmium oxide (CdO); the crystalline form of this compound <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> red which changes color when heated, similar to zinc oxide. Hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and nitric acid dissolve cadmium by forming cadmium chloride (CdCl2), cadmium sulfate (CdSO4), or cadmium nitrate (Cd(NO3)2). The oxidation state +1 can be produced by dissolving cadmium in a mixture of cadmium chloride and aluminium chloride, forming the Cd22+ cation, which is similar to the Hg22+ cation in mercury(I) chloride.|$|E
5|$|Dorsally, {{the color}} pattern {{consists}} of a deep yellow, tan, or brown ground color, with three series of dark brown spots that run {{the length of the}} body. Each of these spots has a black ring around it, the outer border of which is intensified with a rim of white or yellow. The dorsal spots, which usually number 23–30, may grow together, while the side spots may break apart. The head has a pair of distinct dark patches, one on each temple, together with a pinkish, salmon, or brownish V or X marking that forms an apex towards the snout. Behind the eye <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> streak, outlined in white, pink, or buff. The venter is white, whitish, yellowish, or pinkish, often with an irregular scattering of dark spots.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, he {{starred in}} {{supporting}} roles in Year of the Dog and Rendition. Year of the Dog <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> {{comedy about a}} lonely middle-aged woman, played by Molly Shannon, who finds that animals are the only beings she can truly rely on. Sarsgaard plays Newt, an androgynous dog trainer, and love interest for Shannon's character. He starred alongside Meryl Streep, Alan Arkin, Reese Witherspoon, and Jake Gyllenhaal in Rendition, a Gavin Hood-directed political thriller about the US policy of extraordinary rendition. Viewed as a sex symbol, Sarsgaard was named one of Salon.com's Sexiest Man Living in 2007. 2008 saw Sarsgaard star in the drama Elegy, based on a Phillip Roth novel, The Dying Animal.
