50|$|Attachment and {{detachment}} {{of a gas}} cylinder leads to constant wear and tear, {{due in part to}} mechanical distress and to gaseous compression and expansion. (Adiabatic effects in rapidly expanding compressed gases can generate very low temperatures,as is the case with a cryoprobe). Such fluctuation in temperatures necessitates a durable and rugged material: neoprene. Prior to the introduction of the Bodok seal, the traditional <b>fibre</b> <b>washer</b> would frequently splay and cause leakage or adhere to the regulator, thus requiring the use of pliers and considerable force to remove it.|$|E
5000|$|Taps are {{normally}} {{connected to the}} water supply {{by means of a}} [...] "swivel tap connector", which is attached {{to the end of the}} water pipe using a soldered or compression fitting, and has a large nut to screw onto the threaded [...] "tail" [...] of the tap, which hangs down underneath the bath, basin or sink. A <b>fibre</b> <b>washer</b> (which expands when wet, aiding the seal) is used between the connector and the tap tail. Tap tails {{are normally}} 1/2" [...] in diameter for sinks and 3/4" [...] for baths, although continental Europe sometimes uses a 3/8" [...] (still imperial) size. The same connection method is used for a ballcock.|$|E
