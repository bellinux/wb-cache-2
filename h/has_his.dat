5|$|Bicycle kicks are {{generally}} done in two situations, one defensive {{and the other}} offensive. A defensive bicycle kick is done when a player facing his side's goal uses the action to clear {{the ball in the}} direction opposite his side's goalmouth. Sports historian Richard Witzig considers defensive bicycle kicks a desperate move requiring less aim than its offensive variety. An offensive bicycle kick is used when a player <b>has</b> <b>his</b> back to the opposing goal and is near the goalmouth. According to Witzig, the offensive bicycle kick requires concentration and a good understanding of the ball's location. Bicycle kicks can also be done in the midfield, but this is not recommended because safer and more accurate passes can be done in this zone.|$|E
