5|$|Rajam died of typhoid in 1939. Her death {{affected}} Narayan {{deeply and}} he remained depressed {{for a long}} time; he was also concerned <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>daughter</b> Hema, who was only three years old. The bereavement brought about {{a significant change in}} his life and was the inspiration behind his next novel, The English Teacher. This book, like his first two books, is autobiographical, but more so, and completes an unintentional thematic trilogy following Swami and Friends and The Bachelor of Arts. In subsequent interviews, Narayan acknowledges that The English Teacher was almost entirely an autobiography, albeit with different names for the characters and the change of setting in Malgudi; he also explains that the emotions detailed in the book reflected his own at the time of Rajam's death.|$|E
5|$|William Rolleston, at {{the time}} Provincial Secretary, {{proposed}} to Mary Brittan in early 1865. He was 34 {{at the time}}, and she was 19. Both Joseph and Sophia Brittan were opposed to a marriage, which is surprising, given that Rolleston was intelligent, well educated, successful, and if anything, of higher social standing. They thought him too old <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>daughter,</b> her too young to marry. Maybe Sophia Brittan {{did not want to}} lose her daughter, who was in effect running the household and entertained guests, as she was often too ill to look after these tasks herself. But Rolleston was offered and accepted the role of Under Secretary for Native Affairs, which required moving to Wellington. Hence, the wedding went ahead on 24 May 1865 at Avonside Trinity Church, before the newly-weds moved to the capital.|$|E

It argues that assumptions in the dominant discourse on girls’ schooling in India obscure the complex negotiations and trade-offs disadvantaged families make when considering schooling choices <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>daughters.</b> Furthermore, they obscure a focus on change resulting from and intertwined with changing socio-economic structures and institutional contexts for schooling over time. The changing institutional context for education through increased LFP provision is the focus for analysis. Data show that participants were not selective in choosing the LFP sector by gender, and {{thought of it as}} representing the best chance <b>for</b> <b>their</b> daughters’ livelihoods...|$|R

25|$|The group left Byron in Switzerland {{at the end}} of {{the summer}} and {{returned}} to England. Clairmont took up residence in Bath and in January 1817 she gave birth to a daughter, Alba, whose name was eventually changed to Allegra. Throughout the pregnancy, Clairmont had written long letters to Byron, pleading for his attention and a promise to care for her and the baby, sometimes making fun of his friends, reminding him how much he had enjoyed making love to her, and sometimes threatening suicide. Byron, who by this time hated her, ignored the letters. The following year, Clairmont and the Shelleys left England and journeyed once more to Byron, who now resided in Italy. Clairmont felt that the future Byron could provide <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>daughter</b> would be greater than any she herself would be able to grant the child and, therefore, wished to deliver Allegra into his care.|$|E

A very ill Hopper did not appear in court though his estranged wife did – case BD518046. Despite Duffy's bid to be named the sole beneficiary of Hopper's million-dollar policy, the judge ruled against her and limited her claim to one-quarter of the policy. The remaining US$750,000 was to go to his estate.|$|E
