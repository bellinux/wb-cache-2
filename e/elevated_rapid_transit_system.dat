40|$|AbstractBus <b>rapid</b> <b>transit,</b> {{with its}} unique {{features}} of high capacity, low cost and short implementation cycle, is preferable for big cities. The <b>elevated</b> bus <b>rapid</b> <b>transit</b> <b>system</b> becomes an efficient approach {{to solve the}} traffic congestion problem in urban area. Although several researches have been conducted on traffic capacity of <b>elevated</b> bus <b>rapid</b> <b>transit</b> <b>system</b> at present, they are lacking of the matching of all facilities. This paper, using matching method, focuses on three aspects of capacity problem, namely the berth, platform area and the fare gate. Based on the methods on traffic capacity of all facilities in previous researches, this paper puts forward the analysis of facility bottleneck of traffic capacity and the optimization method on capacity of the <b>elevated</b> bus <b>rapid</b> <b>transit</b> <b>system.</b> The case states the facility bottlenecks of traffic capacity analyzed by the approach are consistent with physical truth...|$|R

25|$|Much of {{the early}} {{development}} of electric locomotion was driven by {{the increasing use of}} tunnels, particularly in urban areas. Smoke from steam locomotives was noxious and municipalities were increasingly inclined to prohibit their use within their limits. The first electrically-worked underground line was the City and South London Railway, prompted by a clause in its enabling act prohibiting use of steam power. It opened in 1890, using electric locomotives built by Mather and Platt. Electricity quickly became the power supply of choice for subways, abetted by the Sprague's invention of multiple-unit train control in 1897. Surface and <b>elevated</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>transit</b> <b>systems</b> generally used steam until forced to convert by ordinance.|$|R
