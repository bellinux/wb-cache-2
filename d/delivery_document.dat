40|$|<b>Document</b> <b>delivery</b> has {{currently}} {{become such}} an important and indispensable service satisfying information needs of users. Rapid developments in information technologies introduced {{a new dimension to}} <b>document</b> <b>delivery</b> services: <b>documents</b> can now be supplied quickly and more easily. This study aims to review the <b>document</b> <b>delivery</b> requests submitted to the <b>Document</b> <b>Delivery</b> Services Unit of the National Academic Network and Information Center (ULAKBIM). It concentrates on the journals and their age whence <b>document</b> <b>delivery</b> requests were filled, and compares the length of time (in days) it takes to fill a request and the unit cost of supplying requests from printed journals as opposed to electronic ones. We tracked the data with regards to <b>document</b> <b>delivery</b> requests that were submitted to the Unit for two months and obtained needed information from the Center to calculate the unit cost. We reviewed the user profiles, requests, journal titles and libraries from which requests were filled. We tested a) if the data about journals conform to Bradford's Law of Scattering, and b) if the ages of requested articles conform to the notion of "literature obsolescence. " We calculated the average unit cost of supplying a document by dividing total cost {{by the total number of}} <b>document</b> <b>delivery</b> requests. We found that the <b>Document</b> <b>Delivery</b> Services Unit satisfied two-thirds (6036) of a total of 9213 <b>document</b> <b>delivery</b> requests submitted to the Unit during the two months' period of our study. Requests were satisfied from a total of 1671 journal titles. Almost half (42 %) of those journal titles were used only once for <b>document</b> <b>delivery</b> purposes. A small number (135) of "core" journals satisfied one- thirds (35 %) of requests and the distribution of journals conforms to Bradford's Law of Scattering. Half (median) of all requests were satisfied from journal issues that were published within the last 7 years. This indicates that more recent articles are requested much more heavily, which is parallel with the phenomenon of literature obsolescence. The unit cost of supplying an article in the year 2000 was found as about 3 million Turkish liras. From submission to the mailing of the document, it took a total of 15 days to fill a <b>document</b> <b>delivery</b> request. As the process of supplying documents from printed journals is no different than that of electronic journals, the length it takes to satisfy a request and its unit cost are similar for both electronic and printed journals. Nevertheless, once the requests that were satisfied from electronic journals were routed to the libraries, the length of providing the documents was much shorter than those for printed journals. The median duration of filling the requests from electronic journals was 1 day as opposed to 4 days from printed journals. In conclusion, costs studies should be done so as to find out the more economical method of <b>document</b> <b>delivery</b> (subscription, commercial <b>document</b> <b>delivery</b> services, and electronic means, among others). Data regarding <b>document</b> <b>delivery</b> requests should be gathered for collection development purposes. It would then be possible to identify core journals and their back issues that should be acquired and maintained. In order to speed up the <b>document</b> <b>delivery</b> process and decrease the costs, ULAKBIM should make a transition to an electronic <b>document</b> <b>delivery</b> system and subscribe to electronic versions of the most heavily requested journals. Requests that are satisfied from electronic and printed journals should be processed separately to speed up the <b>document</b> <b>delivery</b> services...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} how a large science, technology and medicine (STM) library used <b>document</b> <b>delivery</b> {{data to support}} the selection of new journal titles {{in order to better}} meet the needs of <b>document</b> <b>delivery</b> clients. Over a nine-month period in 2004, the Canada Institute for Scientific and Technical Information (CISTI) undertook a review of its current serial subscriptions to determine whether they continued {{to meet the needs of}} researchers at the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) and the needs of <b>document</b> <b>delivery</b> clients both in Canada and internationally. This paper describes the study of the print serial collection and the findings. Bibliographic data on current serial titles in CISTI's Catalogue was compared with <b>Document</b> <b>Delivery</b> data on filled orders. Further analysis was then done to extract <b>document</b> <b>delivery</b> usage data on unfilled orders. Subject analysis of the collection and usage were done by Library of Congress (LC) Classification and by user group. The data on unfilled <b>document</b> <b>delivery</b> orders identified titles not held at CISTI but from which clients were requesting articles. Data from the National Library of Medicine (NLM) was used to identify titles needed by Canadian libraries but not widely available in Canada. The findings showed that while CISTI clients were well served in most fields, there was a need to enhance the collection, notably in the health sciences and to a lesser extent, business. As a result, 135 new medical and health serial titles were purchased. The study confirmed that <b>document</b> <b>delivery</b> usage data could be used effectively to support strategic library collection development decisions.
