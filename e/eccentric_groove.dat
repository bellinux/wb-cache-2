40|$|A new morphometric {{approach}} {{was developed to}} study morphological variation within P 1 elements {{commonly referred to as}} Idiognathodus simulator, which was selected to be the biostratigraphic marker for the base of the global Gzhelian Stage (Carboniferous). This new approach combines landmark-based geometric morphometrics with eigen analyses to analyze shape variation within P 1 elements of the I. simulator group, and could be used to analyze shape variation in other morphologically similar conodont groups. Specimens analyzed were obtained from three sections of the early Gzhelian Heebner Shale of the Oread cyclothem in the North American Midcontinent region, the cyclothem from which I. simulator was originally named. This analysis shows that the I. simulator group comprises a set of at least five species with asymmetrical P 1 element pairs, relatively short adcarinal ridges, and a variably developed <b>eccentric</b> <b>groove.</b> Species discrimination is based on the presence of caudal and rostral lobes, character of the adcarinal ridges, and platform shape. The species I. simulator is restricted to P 1 elements with a caudal adcarinal ridge that is isolated from the caudal platform margin. Idiognathodus lateralis sp. nov. is erected to include P 1 elements with a caudal adcarinal ridge that is not isolated from the caudal platform margin...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundWound healing events after implant {{placement}} {{will vary}} according to the extent of the necrotic zone. PurposeThe goal {{of the present study was}} to evaluate bone healing around titanium implants with a novel apical chamber design. Materials and MethodsTitanium implants grade 4 were turned with different apex design. Control implants had a self tapping design with centric cutting grooves. Test implants exhibited <b>eccentric</b> cutting <b>grooves</b> interconnected by a hollow chamber. A total of 60 implants were installed in the femur/tibia of 10 rabbits for histological analysis. ResultsAfter 1 week, immature bone formation started at the cortical level of the test implants associated to scalloped contours indicative of bone resorption. Control implants failed to show new bone formation, and the space within the threads was filled mainly by red blood cells and surgical debris. Bone contact values showed no difference after 1 week, and significant higher values for test implants showed likewise after 4 weeks compared with control implants in the tibia. ConclusionThis experimental study verifies the beneficial effect of bone formation in the chamber at the apical part of the fixture coupled to a faster bone healing to implants placed in dense bone...|$|R
