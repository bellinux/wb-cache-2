5|$|In 1950, Watts {{settled in}} Durham, N.C. with his wife, Constance Merrick Watts, {{a native of}} the town. He opened a private clinic in general surgery <b>for</b> <b>poor</b> <b>people</b> and African Americans, as blacks had very limited access to medical services. In 1965, he was the chief of surgery at the Lincoln Hospital, {{which was one of the}} city's few {{hospitals}} to serve blacks. The hospital consisted of 150 beds. The hospital was also one of the few hospitals in America at that time which allow African American doctors to perform surgery. While working as chief of surgery Watts also served as a trainer for the hospital's interns. In the 1970s he played a major role in establishing the Lincoln Community Health Center.|$|E

5|$|Thani Oruvan is a 2015 Indian Tamil-language action thriller film {{directed}} by Mohan Raja, who also co-wrote the screenplay and dialogues with the duo Subha. The film features Jayam Ravi and Nayanthara {{in the lead}} roles. Arvind Swamy, Thambi Ramaiah, Ganesh Venkatraman, Mugdha Godse and Nassar play supporting roles. The film's story focuses on Mithran (Ravi), an IPS officer, who learns of the plans of scientist and businessman Siddharth Abhimanyu (Swamy) to sabotage a deal to make generic medicines available at low cost <b>for</b> <b>poor</b> <b>people.</b> Siddharth succeeds in his plan and begins indulging {{in a game of}} cat and mouse with Mithran. The rest of the story revolves around how Mithran overcomes the obstacles set by Siddharth. Produced by Kalpathi S. Aghoram, Kalpathi S. Ganesh and Kalpathi S. Suresh under their company AGS Entertainment, the film's soundtrack and score were composed by Hiphop Tamizha. Ramji and Gopi Krishna handled the cinematography and editing respectively.|$|E
25|$|Health {{security}} – Health Security aims {{to guarantee}} a minimum protection from diseases and unhealthy lifestyles. In developing countries, the major causes of death traditionally were infectious and parasitic diseases, whereas in industrialized countries, the major killers were diseases of the circulatory system. Today, lifestyle-related chronic diseases are leading killers worldwide, with 80 percent of deaths from chronic diseases occurring in low- and middle-income countries. According to the United Nations, in both developing and industrial countries, threats to health security are usually greater <b>for</b> <b>poor</b> <b>people</b> in rural areas, particularly children. This is due to malnutrition and insufficient access to health services, clean water and other basic necessities.|$|E

500|$|Built as Patriot Place in the mid-1810s, Tilbury Place (renamed in the 1860s) and {{its five}} houses {{stood next to}} the farm and formed a pocket of high-class {{residential}} development in a mostly working-class area of small houses. [...] Number 1, also called St John's Lodge, was the largest, and was built for Edward Tarner (a merchant) and his wife Laetitia, whose maiden name was Tilbury. It passed through the family until 1933, when Laetitia Tilbury Tarner, a descendant, left it to Brighton Corporation for charitable purposes.

500|$|Throughout {{recorded}} history, {{the rich}} {{have been able}} to afford a varied diet including meat, vegetables and fruit, but <b>for</b> <b>poor</b> <b>people,</b> meat was a luxury and the food they ate was very dull, typically comprising mainly some staple product made from rice, rye, barley, wheat, millet or maize. The addition of vegetable matter provided some variety to the diet. The staple diet of the Aztecs in Central America was maize and they cultivated tomatoes, avocados, beans, peppers, pumpkins, squashes, peanuts, and amaranth seeds to supplement their tortillas and porridge. [...] In Peru, the Incas subsisted on maize in the lowlands and potatoes at higher altitudes. They also used seeds from quinoa, supplementing their diet with peppers, tomatoes, and avocados.|$|E

500|$|Treves's {{depiction}} of Tom Norman, the showman who had exhibited Merrick, {{was that of}} a cruel drunk who had ruthlessly exploited his charge. In a letter to the World's Fair newspaper, and later in his own memoirs, Norman denied this characterisation and said that he provided his show attractions with a way of earning a living, and that at the London Hospital, Merrick was still on display, but with no control over how or when he was viewed. According to Nadja Durbach, author of The Spectacle of Deformity: Freak Shows and Modern British Culture, Norman's view gives an insight into the Victorian freak show's function as a means of survival <b>for</b> <b>poor</b> <b>people</b> with deformities, as well as the attitude of medical professionals of the time. Durbach cautions that both Treves's and Norman's memoirs must be understood as [...] "narrative reconstructions ... that reflect personal and professional prejudices and cater to the demands and expectations of their very different audiences".|$|E

2500|$|The {{health care}} system {{represents}} a social determinant of health {{as well as it}} influences other determining factors.

2500|$|It is {{believed}} primary motivations were shared religion with the Mexicans and {{sympathy for the}} Mexican cause based on similarities between the situations in Mexico and Ireland. This hypothesis is based on evidence {{of the number of}} Irish Catholics in the Battalion, the letters of John Riley, and the field entries of senior officers. Another hypothesis is that the members of the Saint Patrick's Battalion had been unhappy with their treatment in the U.S. Army; this was the conviction of George Ballentine, an Englishman who served in the American army. Ballentine stated that while [...] "there was a portion of truth" [...] in the view—commonly assigned by officers—that the deserters joined the Mexican army due to their Catholicism, [...] "I have good reason to believe, in fact in some cases I know, that harsh and unjust treatment by their officers operated far more strongly than any other consideration to produce the deplorable result ," [...] describing how he found the punishments used for [...] "trivial offensives" [...] to be [...] "revolting and disgusting". Another theory some historians hold is that the soldiers were attracted by the incentives offered by the Mexican government: safe passage throughout Mexico for deserters, generous land grants, and the offer of potential military commissions. <b>For</b> <b>poor</b> <b>people</b> coming from famine conditions, economics was often an important incentive.|$|E

Additionally, access to sharing economy can be limited, particularly <b>for</b> <b>poorer</b> <b>people</b> without smartphones, who thus lack access to cheaper services that the better-off can use [36].|$|R
