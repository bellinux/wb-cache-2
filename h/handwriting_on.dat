5|$|The fourth copy, {{owned by}} Salisbury Cathedral, was first given in 1215 to its predecessor, Old Sarum Cathedral. Rediscovered by the cathedral in 1812, it has {{remained}} in Salisbury throughout its history, except when being taken off-site for restoration work. It is possibly the best preserved of the four, although small pin holes {{can be seen in}} the parchment from where it was once pinned up. The <b>handwriting</b> <b>on</b> this version is different from that of the other three, suggesting that it was not written by a royal scribe but rather by a member of the cathedral staff, who then had it exemplified by the royal court.|$|E

Cohen says in an article published in the Times Literary Supplement in 2003 that in the 1960s, Dodgson's great-nephew Philip Dodgson Jacques told him that Jacques had written the note himself based on conversations he remembered with Dodgson's nieces. Cohen's article offered no evidence to support this, however, and known samples of Jacques' handwriting do not seem to resemble the writing of the note.|$|E
25|$|On March 3, 2007, an American Greetings Christmas card {{sent to the}} Chronicle, postmarked 1990 in Eureka had {{recently}} been discovered in their photo files by editorial assistant Daniel King. Inside the envelope, with the card, was a photocopy of two U.S. Postal keys on a magnet keychain. The <b>handwriting</b> <b>on</b> the envelope resembles Zodiac's print, but was declared inauthentic by forensic document examiner Lloyd Cunningham. However, not all Zodiac experts agree with Cunningham's analysis. There is no return address on the envelope nor is his crossed-circle signature to be found. The card itself is unmarked. The Chronicle turned over all the material to the Vallejo Police Department for further analysis.|$|E
25|$|The oldest {{forms of}} the letters in antiquity are {{majuscule}} forms. Besides the upright, straight inscriptional forms (capitals) found in stone carvings or incised pottery, more fluent writing styles adapted for <b>handwriting</b> <b>on</b> soft materials were also developed during antiquity. Such handwriting has been preserved especially from papyrus manuscripts in Egypt since the Hellenistic period. Ancient handwriting developed two distinct styles: uncial writing, with carefully drawn, rounded block letters of about equal size, used as a book hand for carefully produced literary and religious manuscripts, and cursive writing, used for everyday purposes. The cursive forms approached the style of lowercase letter forms, with ascenders and descenders, {{as well as many}} connecting lines and ligatures between letters.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} robust method to detect {{handwritten}} text from unconstrained drawings on normal whiteboards. Unlike printed text on documents, free form handwritten text has no pattern in terms of size, orientation and font and it is often mixed with other drawings such as lines and shapes. Unlike <b>handwritings</b> <b>on</b> paper, <b>handwritings</b> <b>on</b> a normal whiteboard cannot be scanned so the detection has {{to be based on}} photos. Our work traces straight edges on photos of the whiteboard and builds graph representation of connected components. We use geometric properties such as edge density, graph density, aspect ratio and neighborhood similarity to differentiate handwritten text from other drawings. The experiment results show that our method achieves satisfactory precision and recall. Furthermore, the method is robust and efficient enough to be deployed in a mobile device. This is an important enabler of business applications that support whiteboard-centric visual meetings in enterprise scenarios. © 2012 IEEE...|$|R

He jumps off, and Emma uses magic to take him safely to the ground, before asking {{why he was so}} sure she’d save him. He says he was optimistic, and then asks what {{happened}} between them in Camelot. He says he forgives her, but she says that she's the Dark One and forgiveness. Hook says there’s nothing she’s done could be as bad as what he’s done. He shows her a ring that belonged to Barnaby, and whom he killed front of his wife. He says that every ring he wears is a sad story. She shows him the ring he gave her to keep safe, and he says it was the saddest story of all; it belonged to a man better than him, his brother Liam. She tries to give it back but he tells her to keep it. He says he wore rings as trophies and now they’re just reminders. When Emma asks if Hook wants to know the truth, no matter how terrible, Hook says he loves her no matter what, and Emma says she needs to show him something. She takes him to her house and she points him to a telescope. He looks and sees the sea and a full moon over the waves. She says he told her the ocean calmed him and he says it’s a nice home she picked, but Emma says that he picked it, not her. He looks at the newspaper and recognized his <b>handwriting</b> <b>on</b> it. She says he told her this was their future and she says everything she did was to keep that future alive. He asks again for the truth and she says they’re almost there and kisses him. She says she can’t tell him everything because he would try and stop her. After the kiss, Hook gets groggy and asks what she's doing, before passing out.|$|E

500|$|Given the {{high-profile}} of the case, the police received several tips from citizens. Police theorized that Fischer {{was killed by}} a drug gang that had mistaken him for someone else. They questioned a man alleged to be the intended victim, but the rumors turned out to be false. They also investigated an abandoned vehicle near the U.S.-Mexico border they suspected was used in the shooting. The car was reported stolen in South Padre Island, but detectives determined that it was not the vehicle the murderers used. The police continued to pursue the lead from the bail office in McKinney. They called the office and asked for recent bail applications from South Texas locations. The office gave them Cuellar's full name, his Dallas address, and faxed a copy of the application. Investigators noticed that the man's handwriting, specifically how the [...] "4" [...] was written, matched the <b>handwriting</b> <b>on</b> the yellow business card found at the murder scene.|$|E
500|$|The case {{remained}} unsolved {{for over}} three years, {{partly due to the}} volume of tips received by police investigators. The biggest tip was from a Madeira Beach police bulletin describing a similar rape of a 24-year-old Canadian tourist some two weeks before the murders (See below under [...] "Witnesses"). Chandler was arrested for the murders on September 24, 1992. His handwritten directions on a brochure found in the Rogers' vehicle, and a description of his boat written by Jo Rogers on the brochure, were the primary clues that led to him being named a suspect. Local police posted images of Chandler's <b>handwriting</b> <b>on</b> the brochure on billboards in the Tampa Bay area, leading to a call from a former neighbor who provided a copy of a work order that he had written. This was the first such use of billboards by law enforcement in the U.S. and billboards became useful tools in later searches for missing people. Through handwriting analysis, the two samples were [...] matched conclusively. Another of Chandler's neighbors, and one of the secretaries on the investigative task force, thought that Chandler resembled the composite sketch of the suspect in the seemingly related rape case. A palm print from the brochure was also matched to Chandler. He had sold his boat and left town with his family soon after the billboards appeared. In 1990, when the television show Unsolved Mysteries was about to report on the deaths of the Rogers family, Chandler and his then-wife moved from their home on Dalton Avenue in Tampa to Port Orange near Daytona Beach.|$|E
500|$|Historically, {{much of what}} {{is written}} about the Gunpowder Plot is derived from Thomas's confession, signed on 23 November 1605; details of the {{so-called}} Spanish Treason were added three days later. [...] One of only two confessions printed in the King's Book (a highly partial contemporary account of the affair), Thomas Wintour's was the only account the government had of a plotter who had been involved from the beginning; Guy Fawkes, weakened by days of torture, may have been {{at the heart of the}} group, but he was not at its first meetings. [...] However, Antonia Fraser views the document with suspicion, not least because Thomas's signature, 'Thomas Winter', differs from his normal signature, 'Thomas Wintour' (it was the former that was invariably used by the government). [...] The signature, possibly forged by lieutenant of the Tower of London William Waad, was made only weeks after Thomas had been shot in the shoulder during the siege at Holbeche House. [...] Biographer Mark Nicholls views the difference in signatures as a significant and puzzling lapse, if a [...] "master forger" [...] is presumed to be responsible for the document. [...] He views the <b>handwriting</b> <b>on</b> the confession as [...] "convincingly that of Winter [...] ", pointing out that it appears to be the work of an author, not an editor, and written as a draft for the King's Book. [...] This is a view that generally, Alan Haynes agrees with: [...] "no one has ever made a solid and sensible suggestion about why a government-employed forger (say Thomas Phelippes) would deliberately make such an error in a crucial state document".|$|E

In June 1934, a woman's torso was found in a suitcase in Brighton railway station. The legs were discovered at King's Cross station the next day, but her head and arms were never found, and the case is still unsolved. A woman by the name of Violette Kaye had disappeared, and the appearance of the first woman's body prompted greater scrutiny on Kaye's case. On 14 July, they interviewed Toni Mancini, Kaye's boyfriend, who convinced them that the dead woman could not possibly be Kaye; the dead woman had been identified as around thirty five years old and five months pregnant, while Kaye was ten years older. Kaye was last seen alive on 10 May looking distressed in the doorway to her house and had been scheduled to visit her sister in London who received a telegram on 11 May reading [...] "Going abroad. Good job. Sail Sunday. Will write. Vi." [...] in block capitals. The post office clerks could not remember who sent it, but experts testified that the <b>handwriting</b> <b>on</b> the telegram had similarities to that on a menu written by Mancini. On 14 May, with the help of another man, Mancini moved his belongings from the house he shared with Kaye, which included a large trunk which was too heavy to move by hand. Mancini had told people that he had broken up with Kaye and she had moved to Paris, and that before she left he had beaten her. He later said to a friend, [...] "What is the good of knocking a woman about with your fists? You only hurt yourself. You should hit her with a hammer same as I did and [...] her up."
