5|$|On March 7, 2016, Bevin {{released}} a video {{on social media}} claiming that House Democrats were not following through on their obligations to help craft the state budget. Legislators responded with a photo and statements that while Bevin was producing his film designed to chastise them, House leaders were in fact in committee meetings working out details of a budget proposal while Speaker Stumbo suggested the Governor was either unfamiliar with the legislative process, or intended to deceive people. On March 12, House Democrats released their own budget, which sustained most of the cuts to <b>executive</b> <b>agencies</b> in Bevin's budget, but exempted public universities from any cuts. The Republican-controlled Senate countered with a proposal that hewed closely to Bevin's original budget.|$|E

The NGO notes that politically sensitive requests, such as the operational costs of the presidency, often were delayed or went unanswered.|$|E

Thus, under the strongly unitary executive theory, independent agencies and counsels are unconstitutional {{to the extent that they}} exercise discretionary executive power not controlled by the president.|$|E

25|$|The {{state court}} system in New York City has two citywide courts, the Criminal Court and the Civil Court, and several statewide courts, the Supreme Court, Surrogate's Court, and Family Court. Unlike {{the rest of}} New York, New York City {{counties}} {{do not have a}} typical County Court. Each statewide court is located in each of New York City's five counties (boroughs). There are also numerous extrajudicial administrative courts, which are <b>executive</b> <b>agencies</b> and not part of the state Unified Court System.|$|E
25|$|Members {{of various}} <b>executive</b> <b>agencies</b> and other officials—such as the {{attorney}} general, the secretary and registrar of the province, the treasurer, {{the commissioner of}} crown lands, and the commissioner of agriculture and public works—are appointed by the Crown under the Great Seal of the province. Further, only in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick may the lieutenant governor appoint judges of the courts of probate, and only in Quebec is the solicitor general commissioned by the viceroy. Public inquiries are also commissioned by the Queen or governor-in-council through a Royal Warrant, and are called royal commissions.|$|E
25|$|The {{president}} can make certain appointments {{only with the}} advice and consent of the Senate. Officials whose appointments require the Senate's approval include members of the Cabinet, heads of most federal <b>executive</b> <b>agencies,</b> ambassadors, Justices of the Supreme Court, and other federal judges. Under Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution, {{a large number of}} government appointments are subject to potential confirmation; however, Congress has passed legislation to authorize the appointment of many officials without the Senate's consent (usually, confirmation requirements are reserved for those officials with the most significant final decision-making authority). Typically, a nominee is first subject to a hearing before a Senate committee. Thereafter, the nomination is considered by the full Senate. The majority of nominees are confirmed, but in a small number of cases each year, Senate committees purposely fail to act on a nomination to block it. In addition, the president sometimes withdraws nominations when they appear unlikely to be confirmed. Because of this, outright rejections of nominees on the Senate floor are infrequent (there have been only nine Cabinet nominees rejected outright in United States history).|$|E

25|$|The {{influence}} of Congress on the presidency has varied from period to period depending on {{factors such as}} congressional leadership, presidential political influence, historical circumstances such as war, and individual initiative by members of Congress. The impeachment of Andrew Johnson made the presidency less powerful than Congress for a considerable period afterwards. The 20th and 21st centuries have seen the rise of presidential power under politicians such as Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George W. Bush. However, in recent years, Congress has restricted presidential power with laws such as the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 and the War Powers Resolution. Nevertheless, the Presidency remains considerably more powerful today than during the 19th century. Executive branch officials are often loath to reveal sensitive information to members of Congress because of concern that information could not be kept secret; in return, knowing they {{may be in the}} dark about executive branch activity, congressional officials are more likely to distrust their counterparts in <b>executive</b> <b>agencies.</b> Many government actions require fast coordinated effort by many agencies, and this is a task that Congress is ill-suited for. Congress is slow, open, divided, and not well matched to handle more rapid executive action or {{do a good job of}} overseeing such activity, according to one analysis.|$|E
