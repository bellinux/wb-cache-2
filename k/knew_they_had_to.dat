5|$|Felicia Tilman (Harriet Sansom Harris), Martha’s sister, soon {{arrives on}} Wisteria Lane {{to find out}} what {{happened}} to her sister. While inside Paul and Mary Alice’s house, she recognizes a picture of Mary Alice and claims her to be Angela, a nurse she worked with years prior in Utah, but Paul is adamant that she is mistaken. Felicia, however, knows that Mary Alice was in fact Angela and later tells Zach that she knew him when he was a baby, and that his original name was so lovely: Dana. In the first season finale, the mystery behind Mary Alice’s suicide is revealed in full. In March 1990, Todd and Angela Forrest could not conceive and one night a woman named Deirdre Taylor (Jolie Jenkins), a heroin addict whom Angela had treated at the rehabilitation hospital where she worked as a nurse, came to their house looking for money and offered to sell her son to them, to which they eventually agreed. When Deirdre returned to the hospital as a patient soon after and suspicion arose as to where her child was, Angela <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> leave town. They moved to Fairview and bought a house on Wisteria Lane, changing their names to Paul, Mary Alice and Zach Young. In 1993, however, Deirdre came to their home, seemingly sober, demanding that she reclaim her son. After a verbal fight, Deirdre went to take her child, when Mary Alice stabbed and killed her. Zach woke up and saw the body, which led to years of his parents brushing off his memories of that night as nothing. Paul and Mary Alice dismembered Deirdre’s body, put it in a toy chest and buried it under their pool. Years later, Martha recognized Mary Alice in a group photo in Felicia’s house, leading to Felicia to tell Martha about how Angela and Todd possibly disappeared with Deirdre’s child and hopefully gave Dana a proper home. Martha then blackmailed Mary Alice and she, in desperation, committed suicide.|$|E

They made themselves as comfortable as possible as high up as they could get to avoid the foul air that sank down.|$|E
25|$|Yajilarra (2008) by Australian {{director}} Melanie Hogan, was {{a powerful}} documentary film based on Oscar’s and the MWRC's campaign to restrict alcohol consumption in Fitzroy Valley. In 2007, Oscar and Emily Carter from the MWRC invited the Sex Discrimination Commissioner (Australian Human Rights Commission), Elizabeth Broderick, to visit Fitzroy Crossing and help {{them to make a}} film that would create social change. To get ongoing help for their community they <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> tell the world about the crisis it was in. Commissioner Broderick introduced Oscar and Carter to The George, who helped secure funding to produce the film. Yajilarra was shown at an event hosted by Commissioner Broderick and the Hon. Tanya Plibersek MP, Australian Minister for the Status of Women, at the 53rd Session of the UN Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) in New York, from 2 to 13 March 2009. That was the first time Australian Aboriginal women were presented at CSW.|$|E

25|$|Instead, {{they spent}} {{about two years}} on {{developing}} {{out the rest of}} the characters, gameplay balance, and graphics. Characters were generally added to the game for one of three reasons: to introduce a new gameplay mechanic or balance gameplay, to incorporate a new character design created by their artistic team, or to help support Overwatchs narrative. In addition to character balance, the development team needed to find ways to balance the characters with the various maps, wanting to provide areas across the maps for each character to have an area where they could be effective. The number of characters in the game was not fixed; though released with 21 different heroes, Kaplan stated the team played around with various goals, potentially as high as 40 unique heroes and across six different classes. Kaplan <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> have more than nine heroes as to separate themselves from Team Fortress 2, which featured nine distinct classes. Kaplan credits Jeff Goodman, a veteran designer in Blizzard, for figuring out the right number of heroes, classes, and balance between the characters. Keller noted that as the cast starting approaching about 15 characters, the team started to worry that there were too many for players to learn and may dilute the experience, but they strived to assure both uniqueness and balance across the slate of Heroes. The team felt the game was ready for release in November 2015 after adding the last two characters, Mei and D.Va, to the roster.|$|E
500|$|EastEnders: E20 was {{conceived}} by executive producer Diederick Santer {{as part of}} EastEnders 25th anniversary celebrations. Described as the [...] "naughty little brother or sister to the main show", it was devised {{in a bid to}} target younger viewers and to develop and nurture new talent. Executive producer John Yorke, who oversaw the show, and is also controller of BBC drama production and new talent, said [...] "Fundamentally the whole idea of the show is it's a training ground for new talent, be that acting, writing, composing, remixing, everything. The fact is because it's online, we can take risks." [...] Nevertheless, the makers said they <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> get it right because [...] "the eyes of the World Wide Web would be watching." ...|$|E
500|$|As a United States citizen, deHavilland became {{involved}} in politics {{as a way of}} exercising her civic responsibilities. She campaigned for Franklin D. Roosevelt's re-election in 1944. After the war, she joined the Independent Citizens' Committee of the Arts, Sciences and Professions, a national public policy advocacy group that included Bette Davis, Gregory Peck and Humphrey Bogart in its Hollywood chapter. In June 1946, she was asked to deliver speeches for the committee that reflected the Communist Party linethe group was later identified as a Communist front organization. Disturbed at seeing a small group of Communist members manipulating the committee, she removed the pro-Communist material from her speeches and rewrote them to reflect Harry S. Truman's anti-Communist platform. She later recalled, [...] "I realized a nucleus of people was controlling the organization without a majority {{of the members of the}} board being aware of it. And I <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be Communists." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} the first to feature flashbacks with Sayid, an Arab character. The {{producers}} <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> tread carefully with the character due to possible prejudices against Arabs. The actor, Naveen Andrews, said, [...] "we were all pretty nervous, {{in the sense that we}} all felt we owed a real obligation, not just to Iraqis but the entire Arab world about how this character would be played." [...] In an early draft of [...] "Solitary", Rousseau told Sayid that she and her research team were studying time. When ABC saw this draft, they asked the producers to remove this line, explaining that they did not want the show to venture into science fiction during the first season. The character of Sullivan, to whose medical woes Jack tended, was created to make the rest of the survivors think that Rousseau's team was killed by an illness. The idea for Hurley's golf course came from script coordinator Brent Fletcher; it was based on a miniature golf course he created in the offices for the television show Angel.|$|E
500|$|Iwata {{clarified}} {{that the}} franchise was not abandoned {{but that the}} game {{would no longer be}} developed for the Nintendo 64, and Miyamoto added that it was not due to project complications or development hell, but to resources needed for Project Dolphin (the GameCube). Some of the artists had been on the project for over three years. They estimated the project to be about 60 percent complete at the time of cancellation—the basics were complete and only programming was left. About 30 percent of the final product was completed. Itoi felt that it would have taken an additional two years to finish properly, and Iwata said that the game might have been finished by 2000 had the scope been reduced two years earlier. Miyamoto was involved in other work and spent little time on-site with the project, and Iwata too was distracted by bankruptcy concerns at HAL Labs and was off-site in 1999 due to circumstances that required travel. Iwata was also hospitalized during production for stress-related reasons. The team intended to have the game finished by the end of 1999 and <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> reconsider their priorities when they missed the milestone. They said that the Mother 3 supervisors had wanted to cancel the project since 1999, but later changed sides and said that cancellation would be wasteful. They discussed bringing the game to their forthcoming GameCube, which Miyamoto felt would have solved some of the Nintendo 64's hardware issues. Miyamoto and Iwata also discussed releasing the game on the Game Boy Advance, but realized that it would take [...] "just as much time" [...] with 40 to 50 staff members to make such a game. In retrospect, Iwata wondered out loud in an interview why the game needed to be in 3D when Itoi's [...] "greatest talent lies in words" [...] and thought that the energy poured into making a 3D game might have been a poor choice. He said he felt [...] "genuinely ashamed", and acknowledged that they were both [...] "caught up in the 3D obsession and felt obligated" [...] at the time. At the time of its cancellation, Itoi predicted that Mother 3 would remain a story that only the game's staff would know, but Miyamoto was still interested in bringing the game to fruition.|$|E

It was all we could make out, for the sea was slopping into her, and the spray was flying everywhere.
