5000|$|The {{book draws}} {{attention}} to the numerical significance of the 2006 global oil production figure: [...] of crude oil per day is equivalent to one thousand barrels per second. He believes the transcendence of this consumption threshold marks the beginning of a historically significant “energy break point” when oil’s dominant position as a primary energy source is no longer tenable. The book examines industrial society's [...] "addiction" [...] to oil in its past, present and future aspects. The history of humankind’s ongoing adoption and abandonment of energy sources - wood, coal, tallow, whale oil, kerosene, etc. - illustrates a “evolutionary energy cycle”. This cycle is evident today in the problems facing the oil industry. At the time of the book’s publication, various factors — ranging from unrest in the Middle East, a “demand shock” from India and China, exceptionally elevated <b>energy</b> <b>commodity</b> prices and climate change anxiety — weakened oil’s leadership amongst all primary energy sources. The author does not commit to the inevitability of any one particular future outcome, but paints various scenarios {{that could lead to a}} peaceful and profitable resolution of the break point.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{examines}} the price linkages among polyester (the dominant chemical fi-ber), cotton (the dominant natural fiber), and crude oil (the dominant <b>energy</b> <b>commodity)</b> based on monthly data between 1980 and 2002. The modeling framework incorporates {{several aspects of}} the unit root econometrics literature. We find that (i) there is strong co-movement between cotton and polyester prices, well above the comovement observed between these two prices and prices of other primary commodities; (ii) crude oil prices have a stronger effect on polyester prices com-pared to cotton prices; (iii) price shocks originating in the polyester market are transmitted at much higher speed to the cotton market than vice-versa...|$|E
40|$|Summary. The {{goals of}} the paper are as follows: i) review some {{qualitative}} properties {{of oil and gas}} prices in the last 15 years; ii) propose some mathematical elements towards a definition of mean reversion that would not be reduced to the form of the drift in a stochastic differential equation; iii) conduct econometric tests in order to conclude whether mean reversion still exists in the <b>energy</b> <b>commodity</b> price behavior. Regarding the third point, a clear “break ” in the properties of oil and natural gas prices and volatility can be exhibited in the period 2000 - 2001.
