5|$|Weather, {{seen from}} an anthropological perspective, is {{something}} all humans {{in the world}} constantly experience through their senses, at least while being outside.

5|$|Broad Channel is a {{small island}} with fewer than 3,000 residents, and as a result, it has {{historically}} {{been one of the}} least-used stations in the system. In 1985, the station had only 224 paying daily riders on a typical weekday not counting farebeaters (people not paying their fare) {{making it one of the}} least used stations in the system. The station has the second-lowest ridership in the subway system as of 2015, with 91,766 annual riders, or 310 riders per weekday. In terms of annual ridership, it was only trailed by Cortlandt Street, a station that is closed to be rebuilt as a result of damage from the September 11 attacks. Overall, Broad Channel is the least used of any fully operating subway station in the city, although on weekdays <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>on</b> average 5 more riders than the Beach 105th Street station. However, it is the only transfer point between the A train and the Rockaway Park Shuttle, and some 2,700 daily riders use it in this capacity. As a result, the platforms are sometimes packed.|$|E

25|$|Oxytocin is {{typically}} remembered {{for the effect}} <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>on</b> prosocial behaviors, such as its role in facilitating trust and attachment between individuals. Consequently, oxytocin {{is often referred to}} as the “love hormone". However, oxytocin has a more complex role than solely enhancing prosocial behaviors. There is consensus that oxytocin modulates fear and anxiety; that is, it does not directly elicit fear or anxiety. Two dominant theories explain the role of oxytocin in fear and anxiety. One theory states that oxytocin increases approach/avoidance to certain social stimuli and the second theory states that oxytocin increases the salience of certain social stimuli, causing the animal or human to pay closer attention to socially relevant stimuli.|$|E

That year, the museum's endowment grew from $99.6 million to $106.8 million. By issuing $383 million in tax-free construction bonds, the museum paid for its ongoing expansion and renovation, which has yielded the new Broad Contemporary Art Museum and the Resnick Exhibition Pavilion as well as other improvements.

25|$|The {{more the}} {{internet}} is incorporated into daily life, the greater the impact <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>on</b> formal language. This {{is especially true in}} modern Language Arts classes through the use of smart phones, tablets, and social media. Students are exposed to the language of the internet more than ever, and as such, the grammatical structure and slang of the internet are bleeding into their formal writing. Full immersion into a language is always the best way to learn it. Mark Lester in his book Teaching Grammar and Usage states, “The biggest single problem that basic writers have in developing successful strategies for coping with errors is simply their lack of exposure to formal written English...We would think it absurd to expect a student to master a foreign language without extensive exposure to it.” Since students are immersed in internet language, that is the form and structure they are mirroring.|$|E
25|$|Caffeine {{can have}} {{multiple}} effects at the cellular level but is primarily notable for the alertness effect that <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>on</b> people. Research has been performed involving phonological priming and TOTs {{in which participants}} took either 200mg of caffeine or a placebo. The participants answered 100 general knowledge questions, each with one correct answer. For each question, participants read 10 priming words that were displayed on a monitor {{for a short period}} of time. Each list of 10 priming words had between two and eight words that were phonologically related to the correct answer of the question, with the remaining words being unrelated. Caffeinated participants had fewer TOT experiences than the placebo group, suggesting better memory recall. However, in the unrelated condition, the caffeinated group did not do as well as the placebo group in their ability to retrieve words. The results suggest that this dose of caffeine (equivalent to two cups of coffee) can temporarily hinder a person’s short-term recall of certain words. Moreover, the general advantageous effect of caffeine on attention can be ruled out.|$|E
