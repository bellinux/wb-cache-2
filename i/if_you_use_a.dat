500|$|Morrissey {{deliberately}} used archaic language when composing the voice-over style lyrics for [...] "This Charming Man". His use of {{phrases and}} {{words such as}} 'hillside desolate', 'stitch to wear', 'handsome' and 'charming' are used to convey a more courtly world than the mid-Eighties north of England, and evoke a style that has, {{in the words of}} the music critic Mat Snow [...] "nothing to do with fashion". Morrissey had already used the word 'handsome' in a song title—in [...] "Handsome Devil", the B-side to [...] "Hand in Glove"—and observed in a 1983 interview with Barney Hoskyns that he used the word to [...] "try and revive some involvement with language people no longer use. In the daily scheme of things, people's language is so frighteningly limited, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> word with more than 10 letters it's absolute snobbery." [...] Snow puts forward the case that through the use of the dated word 'charming', Morrissey sought to rebel against the then mainstream gay culture from which he felt alienated. Morrissey told Hoskyns: [...] "I hate this 'festive faggot' thing ... People listen to [...] "This Charming Man" [...] and think no further than what anyone would presume. I hate that angle, and it's surprising that the gay press have harped on more than anyone else. I hate it when people talk to me about sex in a trivial way." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} factors regarding public opinion about illegal immigration is the level of unemployment; anti-illegal immigrant sentiment is highest where unemployment is highest and vice versa. In general, some say that illegal immigrants are taking away jobs from Americans; however businesses and agricultural groups disagree and say that migrant workers are needed to fill unattractive jobs. This is further supported by a May 2006 New York Times/CBS News Poll report that 53 percent of Americans felt [...] "illegal immigrants mostly take the jobs Americans don't want". However, there are others who say that illegal immigration helps to [...] "decimate the bargaining leverage of the American worker. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> form of labor recruitment that bids down the cost of labor, that leads you to a society where a small number are very, very rich, there's nobody in the middle, and everyone is left scrambling for crumbs at the bottom. Yet there are still others who say that the U.S. [...] "has an economy that depends on illegal immigration" [...] and [...] "without illegal immigration labor, it would almost certainly not be possible to produce the same volume of food in the country." ...|$|E

5000|$|The SDES method {{does not}} address the [...] "end-to-end" [...] media encryption. For example, if user A is talking to user B via a proxy P, SDES allows {{negotiation}} of keys between A and P or between B and P, but not between A and B. For end-to-end media security you must first establish a trust relationship with the other side. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> trusted intermediate for this, the call setup delay will significantly increase, which makes applications like push-to-talk difficult. If you do this peer-to-peer, it might be difficult for you to identify the other side. For example, your operator might implement a B2BUA architecture and play the role of the other side, so that you still don't have end-to-end security. Newer, modern protocols, like ZRTP, offer end-to-end encryption for SIP/RTP calls.|$|E
50|$|As {{a general}} rule, tools which {{work well for}} rip cutting do not work well for crosscutting. Most woodworkers thus have a table saw, which is used for rip cutting, and a {{separate}} chop or miter saw, which is used for crosscutting. Crosscut power-saws should never be used for ripping a board because it is very dangerous. Circular saw blades designed for rip cutting have {{a smaller number of}} larger teeth than similar blades designed for cross cutting. There are combination blades for table saws {{that can be used for}} ripping and cross cutting but should not be used for non through cuts such as dados and rabbets. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> radial arm saw to rip you need a blade with a negative hook angle for the teeth to keep the saw from lifting the board off the saw and kicking back.|$|E

50|$|McLuhan {{talks about}} media being “hot” or “cold” and {{touches on the}} {{principle}} that distinguishes them from one another. A hot medium (i.e., radio or Movie) extends a single sense in “high definition”. High definition means the state of being well filled with data. A cool medium (i.e., Telephone and TV) is considered “low definition” because a small amount of data/information is given and has to be filled in. Hot media are low in participation and cool media are high in participation. Hot media are low in participation because it is giving most of the information and it excludes. Cool media are high in participation because it gives you information but you have to fill in the blanks and it is inclusive. He used lecturing as an example for hot media and seminars as an example for low media. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> hot medium in a hot or cool culture makes a difference.|$|E

50|$|When {{fighting}} a monster or another player, {{you can either}} use a standard attack, a skill, or an item. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> standard attack, you must randomly select a DC Die from the dice bag. After retrieving the die, the opposing player must roll a die of the same kind. Rolling the die determines the attack strength of both characters. The lowest roll wins and the winning character inflicts the amount of damage as the die reads. If the attacking player loses, the attack has no effect whatsoever. If a skill is used, an absolute damage is inflicted to the opponent, no matter {{the outcome of a}} dice roll. Skills, however, take up action points (AP). Items can also be used in combat. If you are {{fighting a}} nightmare, a nightmare will deal absolute damage automatically. A restorative item, such as a potion, can be used to restore health points (HP). An offensive item, such as a grenade, can be used to deal an absolute damage to the opponent.|$|E

Its diffusion stage spreads {{every part of}} the input to {{every part of the}} output: changing one bit of input changes half the output bits on average.

The secret key is mixed in at every stage so that an attacker cannot precalculate what the cipher does.None of this would happen <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>used</b> <b>a</b> simple one-stage scramble based on a key.
