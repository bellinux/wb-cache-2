5|$|Much {{time was}} spent on getting guitars to sound as Simon preferred. A bit of {{experimentation}} among the additional session players occurred, from which Simon would edit himself, compiling them together or often deleting them altogether. Many songs were recorded with a hand-built cigar-box guitar, which Simon bought from Mississippi blues musician Super Chikan. Analogue effects were applied before recording digitally to keep mixes simple; this method also inspired Simon while arranging the songs. Smith would burn Simon a compact disc each evening of the day’s session, and he would return {{the next day with}} notes on the recordings. This resulted in mixes being created as the album developed, rather than at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>process.</b> Simon and Ramone often listened to their recordings while driving around, noting what would need changes.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} schedule a project online in a supply chain without rescheduling or disturbing the previous schedules.

30|$|Plasmid {{maintenance}} is also {{strongly influenced by}} the induction strategy employed. It remained between 96 and 100 % before induction for all experiments, and decreased in different intensities according to the induction regimen adopted, ranging from 70 % (Exps # 2 and # 3) to 95 % (Exp # 4) at <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>processes.</b> <b>The</b> metabolic burden imposed to plasmid-carrying cells after induction causes a growth deceleration, which favors <b>the</b> growth <b>of</b> plasmid-free cells, generated by unequal partition of plasmids between daughter cells (Summers 1991). Shorter periods of induction may prevent <b>the</b> accumulation <b>of</b> plasmid-free cells, avoiding {{a reduction in the}} protein productivity with time. Glucose in the batch medium is also supposed to have a beneficial effect on plasmid maintenance, as it represses expression leakage before induction by catabolite repression (Zhang et al. 2003).|$|R

The functioning of the Brussels institutions was also amended during the fifth state reform, which resulted among other things in a guaranteed representation of the Flemish inhabitants of Brussels in the Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region.|$|E
25|$|While {{hydrophobic}} polymers beneficially repel {{water and}} contribute to chewiness, they also detrimentally attract oil. The stickiness of gum results from this hydrophobic nature, as gum can form bonds and stick when it makes contact with oily surfaces such as sidewalks, skin, hair, or the sole of one’s shoe. To make matters worse, unsticking the gum is a challenge because the long polymers of the gum base stretch, rather than break. The sticky characteristic of gum may be problematic during processing if the gum sticks to any machinery or packaging materials during processing, impeding the flow of product. Aside from ensuring that the machinery is free from lipid-based residues, this issue can be combatted by the conditioning and coating of gum toward the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>process.</b> By adding either a powder or a coating to {{the exterior of the}} gum product, the hydrophobic gum base binds to the added substance instead of various surfaces with which it may come in contact.|$|E
25|$|A network can be {{considered}} a description of the paths along which something flows. This allows a characterization based on the type of flow and the type of path encoded by the centrality. A flow can be based on transfers, where each undivisible item goes from one node to another, like a package delivery which goes from the delivery site to the client's house. A second case is the serial duplication, where this is a replication of the item which goes to the next node, so both the source and the target have it. An example is the propagation of information through gossip, with the information being propagated in a private way and with both the source and the target nodes being informed at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>process.</b> The last case is the parallel duplication, with the item being duplicated to several links at the same time, like a radio broadcast which provides the same information to many listeners at once.|$|E

At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>process,</b> a total of 17 municipalities had ratified the constitutional change and 15 had voted against ratification, while 1 municipality was awarded an extra week, although the clear majority being in favor meant that same-sex marriage would become legal in the state.

Additionally, the municipalities of Axochiapan, Cuernavaca, Mazatepec, Tepalcingo and Tlayacapan did not vote (constructive assent). The remaining municipalities voted against the change.
