As she matured into a young woman, O'Hara, like many actresses, became increasingly self-conscious, which affected her for a while. In one performance, which was watched by her father {{from the back of}} the theatre, O'Hara [...] "sensed there was someone out front watching me, perhaps critically.

500|$|Nelson's {{body was}} placed in a cask of brandy mixed with camphor and myrrh, which was then lashed to the Victory's {{mainmast}} and placed under guard. Victory was towed to Gibraltar after the battle, and on arrival the body was transferred to a lead-lined coffin filled with spirits of wine. Collingwood's dispatches about the battle were carried to England aboard , and when the news arrived in London, a messenger was sent to Merton Place to bring the news of Nelson's death to Emma Hamilton. She later recalled, They brought me word, Mr Whitby from the Admiralty. [...] "Show him in directly", I said. He came in, and with a pale countenance and faint voice, said, [...] "We have gained a great Victory." [...] – [...] "Never mind your Victory", I said. [...] "My letters – give me my letters" [...] – Captain Whitby was unable to speak – tears in his eyes and a deathly paleness over his face made me comprehend him. I believe <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>a</b> scream and fell back, and for ten hours I could neither speak nor shed a tear.|$|E
500|$|The {{actors who}} voiced the {{characters}} in the short later reprised their roles in The Simpsons series. Dan Castellaneta performed the voices of Homer Simpson, Grampa Simpson, and Krusty the Clown. Homer's voice sounds different in the shorts compared to most episodes of the half-hour show, as Castellaneta originally tried to impersonate Walter Matthau. Although he would retain this characteristic through the early episodes of the regular series, it was gradually dropped as Homer's personality evolved away from that of a stereotypical sitcom father. The producers of the show were in need of someone to do voiceovers, so rather than hire actors, they asked Castellaneta (who had already done some voice work) and Julie Kavner, both members of the Ullman Show cast, to do it. The kids still needed voices, and Nancy Cartwright, a journeyman voice actress, came in to audition. She recalled that [...] "I was already doing voicework for eight different shows at the time and thought this would just be another job. They originally wanted me for Lisa's voice, but I thought 'Nah, I don't want to be the boring middle child, I want to be a bratty 10-year old boy.' So as soon as <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>a</b> demonstration, [...] hired me on the spot." [...] Some time later, Yeardley Smith, a 22-year-old B-movie actress whose most notable accomplishment to date was featuring in the notorious 1986 Stephen King film Maximum Overdrive, was brought in to do Lisa's voice. [...] The recording of the shorts was often primitive; according to Cartwright, the dialogue for the Ullman shorts was recorded on a portable tape deck in a makeshift studio, which consisted of the video engineer suite, above the bleachers on the Ullman show set. While most of the characters' personalities are similar to what they are in the series, Lisa is simply a clone of Bart and did not have a distinct personality until a few episodes into the regular series.|$|E

Two women, one elderly and the other pregnant, were {{reported}} to have been seized by the ghost on separate occasions while walking near the churchyard; they were apparently so frightened they both died from shock a few days afterwards. A brewer's servant, Thomas Groom, later testified that, while walking through the churchyard with a companion one night, at close to 9:00pm, something rose from behind a tombstone and seized him by the throat. Hearing the scuffle, his companion turned around, at which the ghost [...] "gave me a twist round, and I saw nothing; <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>a</b> bit of a push out with my fist, and felt something soft, like a great coat." ...|$|E
2500|$|In non-verb-final {{languages}}, {{apart from}} languages like Thai and Vietnamese with very strong politeness distinctions in their grammars, gapped relative clauses tend, however, to {{be restricted to}} positions {{high up in the}} accessibility hierarchy. With obliques and genitives, non-verb-final languages that do not have politeness restrictions on pronoun use tend to use pronoun retention. English is unusual in that all roles in the embedded clause can be indicated by gapping: e.g. [...] "I saw the man who is my friend", but also (in progressively less accessible positions cross-linguistically, according to the accessibility hierarchy described below) [...] "...who I know", [...] "...who <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>a</b> book to", [...] "...who I spoke with", [...] "...who I run slower than". Usually, languages with gapping disallow it beyond a certain level in the accessibility hierarchy, and switch to a different strategy at this point. [...] Classical Arabic, for example, only allows gapping in the subject and sometimes the direct object; beyond that, a resumptive pronoun must be used. Some languages have no allowed strategies at all past a certain point—e.g. in many Austronesian languages, such as Tagalog, all relative clauses must have the shared noun serving the subject role in the embedded clause. In these languages, relative clauses with shared nouns serving [...] "disallowed" [...] roles can be expressed by passivizing the embedded sentence, thereby moving the noun in the embedded sentence into the subject position. This, for example, would transform [...] "The man who <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>a</b> book to" [...] into [...] "The man who was given a book by me". Generally, languages such as this [...] "conspire" [...] to implement general relativization by allowing passivization from all positions — hence a sentence equivalent to [...] "The man who is run slower than by me" [...] is grammatical. Note also that gapping is often used in conjunction with case-marked relative pronouns (since the relative pronoun indicates the case role in the embedded clause), but this is not necessary (e.g. Chinese and Japanese both using gapping in conjunction with an indeclinable complementizer).|$|E

2500|$|After the 2010 {{elections}} and the announcement from Rep. Mike Pence that he was stepping away from his leadership position in the House, Bachmann announced on her Facebook page her intention to seek the position of House Republican Conference Chair. As Bachmann {{is the founder of}} the House's Tea Party Caucus, her announcement caused some to see the leadership election as [...] "an early test of how GOP leaders will treat the antiestablishment movement's winners". Many among the House's Republican leadership, including Eric Cantor and the retiring Mike Pence, were quick to endorse Rep. Jeb Hensarling for the position; Speaker-to-be John Boehner remained neutral on the issue. Supporters of Bachmann's run include Reps. Steve King, John Kline, Louie Gohmert, Chip Cravaack, Erik Paulsen, as well as media personality and political commentator Glenn Beck. Listing her qualifications for the position Bachmann noted [...] "I've done an effective job speaking out at a national and local level, motivating people with our message, calling attention to deficits in Obama's policy. I was instrumental in bringing {{tens of thousands of people}} to the U.S. capitol to rally against Obama care and to attend our press conference." [...] She noted her work to keep the Tea Party within the GOP rather than having it become a third party thereby helping the party capture the House, stating [...] "I have been able to bring a voice and motivate people to, in effect, put that gavel in John Boehner's hands, so that Republicans can lead going forward. …It's important that leadership represents the choice of the people coming into our caucus….I think I have motivated a high number of people to get involved in this cycle who may have sat it out and that have made a difference on a number of these races. <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>a</b> large amount of money to NRCC and individual candidates and started Michele PAC, which raised $650,000 for members since July, so I was able to financially help about 50 people out." ...|$|E
