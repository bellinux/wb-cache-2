50|$|Before {{standard}} benchmarks were available, {{average speed}} rating of computers {{was based on}} calculations for a mix of instructions with the results given in <b>kilo</b> <b>Instructions</b> <b>Per</b> <b>Second</b> (kIPS). The most famous was the Gibson Mix, produced by Jack Clark Gibson of IBM for scientific applications. Other ratings, such as the ADP mix which does not include floating point operations, were produced for commercial applications. The thousand instructions per second (kIPS) unit is rarely used today, as most current microprocessors can execute at least a million instructions per second.|$|E
50|$|The term is {{commonly}} used in association with a numeric value such as thousand/kilo <b>instructions</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> (TIPS/KIPS), million <b>instructions</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> (MIPS), and billion <b>instructions</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> (GIPS).|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} set {{of tools}} that generate instruction set simula-tors, assemblers, and disassemblers from a single description was developed to test if retargetable development tools would work for commercial DSP processors and microprocessors. The processor instruction set was described using a language called nML. The TMS 320 C 50 DSP processor and the ARM 7 microprocessor were modeled in nML. The resulting instruction set models execute about 25, 000 <b>instructions</b> <b>per</b> <b>second,</b> and compiled <b>instruction</b> set simulation models execute about 150, 000 <b>instructions</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> The viability of this approach and the deficiencies of nML are dis-cussed. 1...|$|R
50|$|MCS-51 based {{microcontrollers}} typically {{include one}} or two UARTs, two or three timers, 128 or 256 bytes of internal data RAM (16 bytes of which are bit-addressable), up to 128 bytes of I/O, 512 bytes to 64 KB of internal program memory, and sometimes a quantity of extended data RAM (ERAM) located in the external data space. External RAM and ROM share the data and address buses. The original 8051 core ran at 12 clock cycles per machine cycle, with most instructions executing in {{one or two}} machine cycles. With a 12 MHz clock frequency, the 8051 could thus execute 1 million one-cycle <b>instructions</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> or 500,000 two-cycle <b>instructions</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> Enhanced 8051 cores are now commonly used which run at six, four, two, or even one clock per machine cycle, and have clock frequencies of up to 100 MHz, and are thus capable of an even greater number of <b>instructions</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> All Silicon Labs, some Dallas and a few Atmel devices have single cycle cores.|$|R
50|$|Several {{variants}} with {{an additional}} 16-bit digital signal processor (DSP) (for example for MP3 or OGG coding/decoding) with up to 675 million <b>instructions</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> (MIPS) and integrated USB 2.0 interface or as intellectual property exist.|$|R
50|$|The IBM AP-101 {{computers}} {{originally had}} about 424 kilobytes of magnetic core memory each. The CPU could process about 400,000 <b>instructions</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> They had no hard disk drive, and loaded software from magnetic tape cartridges.|$|R
50|$|Modern 8051 cores are {{faster than}} earlier {{packaged}} versions. Design improvements have increased 8051 performance while retaining compatibility {{with the original}} MCS 51 instruction set. The original Intel 8051 ran at 12 clock cycles per machine cycle, and most instructions executed {{in one or two}} machine cycles. A typical maximum clock frequency of 12 MHz meant these old 8051s could execute one million single-cycle instructions, or 500,000 two-cycle <b>instructions,</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> In contrast, enhanced 8051 silicon IP cores now run at one clock cycle per machine cycle, and have clock frequencies of up to 450 MHz.

50|$|The slowest System/360 model {{announced}} in 1964, the Model 30, could perform up to 34,500 <b>instructions</b> <b>per</b> <b>second,</b> with memory from 8 to 64 KB. High performance models came later. The 1967 IBM System/360 Model 91 could do up to 16.6 million <b>instructions</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> The larger 360 models could {{have up to}} 8 MB of main memory, though main memory that big was unusual—a more typical large installation might have as little as 256 KB of main storage, but 512 KB, 768 KB or 1024 KB was more common. Up to 8 megabytes of slower (8 microsecond) Large Capacity Storage (LCS) was also available.|$|R
