It considers the mechanisms by which EMU produces <b>its</b> <b>effects,</b> and the role of domestic policy‐makers and institutions in shaping national responses. It places the EMU within the context of globalization, and explores its operations within specific sectors. Its main conclusions are that the EMU is most important in affecting the tempo of domestic policy changes, and in strengthening the pressures for convergence. However, while EMU contains a neo‐liberalizing tendency exhibited most clearly in <b>its</b> <b>effects</b> on financial markets, <b>its</b> <b>effects</b> should not be perceived as limited to the Anglo‐American model of market capitalism...|$|R

5|$|Voyager 1s mission {{included}} a flyby of Titan, Saturn's largest moon, which {{had long been}} known to have an atmosphere. Images taken by Pioneer 11 in 1979 had indicated the atmosphere was substantial and complex, further increasing interest. The Titan flyby occurred as the spacecraft entered the system to avoid any possibility of damage closer to Saturn compromising observations, and approached to within , passing behind Titan as seen from Earth and the Sun. Voyager's measurement of the atmosphere's effect on sunlight, and Earth-based measurement of <b>its</b> <b>effect</b> on the probe's radio signal {{were used to determine}} the atmosphere's composition, density, and pressure. Titan's mass was also measured by observing <b>its</b> <b>effect</b> on the probe's trajectory. Thick haze prevented any visual observation of the surface, but the measurement of the atmosphere's composition, temperature, and pressure led to speculation that lakes of liquid hydrocarbons could exist on the surface.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, {{selection}} can {{be divided}} according to <b>its</b> <b>effect</b> on genetic diversity. Purifying or negative selection acts to remove genetic variation from the population (and is opposed by de novo mutation, which introduces new variation. In contrast, balancing selection acts to maintain genetic variation in a population, {{even in the absence}} of de novo mutation, by negative frequency-dependent selection. One mechanism for this is heterozygote advantage, where individuals with two different alleles have a selective advantage over individuals with just one allele. The polymorphism at the human ABO blood group locus has been explained in this way.|$|E

5|$|Besides {{the galactic}} tide, the main trigger for sending comets {{into the inner}} Solar System {{is thought to be}} {{interaction}} between the Sun's Oort cloud and the gravitational fields of nearby stars or giant molecular clouds. The orbit of the Sun through the plane of the Milky Way sometimes brings it in relatively close proximity to other stellar systems. For example, it is hypothesized that 70thousand years ago, perhaps Scholz's star passed through the outer Oort cloud (although its low mass and high relative velocity limited <b>its</b> <b>effect).</b> During the next 10million years the known star with the greatest possibility of perturbing the Oort cloud is Gliese 710. This process could also scatter Oort cloud objects out of the ecliptic plane, potentially also explaining its spherical distribution.|$|E
