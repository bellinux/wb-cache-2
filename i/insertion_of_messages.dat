Steganography is the art and science which studies how the concealment of confidential information to the media so that a man can not realize the existence of the message.

On steganography there are several methods in the <b>insertion</b> <b>of</b> <b>messages,</b> one of which is the method of spread spectrum.

40|$|AbstractMany {{protocols}} {{are designed}} to operate correctly even in the case where the underlying communication medium is faulty. To capture the behavior of such protocols, Lossy Channel Systems (LCS’s) have been proposed. In an LCS the communication channels are modeled as unbounded FIFO buffers which are unreliable {{in the sense that}} they can nondeterministically lose messages. Recently, several attempts have been made to study Probabilistic Lossy Channel Systems (PLCS’s) in which the probability <b>of</b> losing <b>messages</b> is taken into account. In this article, we consider a variant of PLCS’s which is more realistic than those studied previously. More precisely, we assume that during each step in the execution of the system, each message may be lost with a certain predefined probability. We show that for such systems the following model-checking problem is decidable: to verify whether a linear-time property definable by a finite-state ω-automaton holds with probability one. We also consider other types of faulty behavior, such as corruption and duplication <b>of</b> <b>messages,</b> and <b>insertion</b> <b>of</b> new <b>messages,</b> and show that the decidability results extend to these models...|$|R

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{proposes a}} novel steganographic method {{based on the}} compression standard according to the Joint Photographic Expert Group and an Entropy Thresholding technique. The steganographic algorithm uses one public key and one private key to generate a binary sequence of pseudorandom numbers that indicate where {{the elements of the}} binary sequence <b>of</b> a secret <b>message</b> will be inserted. The insertion takes eventually place at the first seven AC coefficients in the transformed DCT domain. Before the <b>insertion</b> <b>of</b> the <b>message</b> the image undergoes several transformations. After the insertion the inverse transformations are applied in reverse order to the original transformations. The insertion itself takes only place if an entropy threshold of the corresponding block is satisfied and if the pseudorandom number indicates to do so. The experimental work on the validation of the algorithm consists of the calculation of the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), the difference and correlation distortion metrics, the histogram analysis, and the relative entropy, comparing the same characteristics for the cover and stego image. The proposed algorithm improves the level of imperceptibility analyzed through the PSNR values.

We predict, with trepidation, that the exploit process will become commonplace and pose greater challenges to the cyber forensics examiner and legal practitioner during investigations and legal proceedings. Regrettably, the exploit complements the existing arsenal of tools for email forgery.

The watermark scrambled by Arnold Transform is embedded in the wavelet coefficients at third resolution level of the MRR. Fuzzy logic approach used in the method makes it to approximate the best possible gain with an accurate scaling factor so that the watermark remains invisible. The fuzzy input variables are computed for each wavelet coefficient in the 3 D model. The output of the fuzzy system is a single value which is a perceptual value for each corresponding wavelet coefficient. Thus, the fuzzy perceptual mask combines all these non-linear variables to build a simple, easy to use HVS model.

40|$|Digital {{steganography}} {{refers to}} the <b>insertion</b> <b>of</b> a secret <b>message</b> into a carrier file to covertly communicate the message. Steganography systems are usually composed <b>of</b> <b>insertion</b> and extraction systems. The insertion system takes a host file, a prepared message file, and an optional key to insert the message into the host for creating a cover host. The cover host is then stored or transmitted. The extraction system operates in reverse. It takes a covert host and an optional key as input and extracts the message. Many steganography systems have some forms of built in encryption and will automatically encrypt and decrypt the <b>message</b> as part <b>of</b> the process. The most common steganography systems use various image and audio formats as host files. These files are usually large and offer the bandwidth necessary for reliable hidden. Video systems are also emerging to exploit the large size of video data files and streams. Some steganography systems do not use a host file at all, but will generate a covert host based on the contents <b>of</b> the <b>message.</b> The degree <b>of</b> covertness of the host depends on {{the capabilities of the}} perceived threat.

50|$|DBMS {{may become}} a complex {{software}} system and its development typically requires thousands of human years of development effort. Some general-purpose DBMSs such as Adabas, Oracle and DB2 have been upgraded since the 1970s.

However, since their development cost can be spread over a large number of users, they are often the most cost-effective approach.

Application programmers may use a wire protocol directly, or more likely through an application programming interface.
