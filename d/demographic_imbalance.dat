25|$|The {{most serious}} <b>demographic</b> <b>imbalance</b> {{is between the}} mountainous areas of the {{interior}} and the coastal strip. The largest province, L'Aquila, is situated entirely in the interior and has the lowest population density. The movement {{of the population of}} Abruzzo from the mountains to the sea has led to the almost complete urbanisation of the entire coastal strip especially in the province of Teramo and Chieti. The effects on the interior have been impoverishment and a demographic ageing, reflected by an activity rate in the province of L'Aquila which is the lowest of the provinces in Abruzzo – accompanied by geological degradation {{as a result of the}} absence of conservation measures. In the coastal strip, on the other hand, there is such a jumble of accommodation and activities that the environment has been changed with negative effects. The policy of providing incentives for development has resulted in the setting-up of industrial zones, some of which (Vasto, Avezzano, Carsoli, Gissi, Val Vibrata, Val di Sangro) have made genuine progress, while others (Val Pescara, L'Aquila) have run into trouble after initial success. The zones of Sulmona and Guardiagrele have turned out to be more or less failures. Outside these zones, the main activities are agriculture and tourism.|$|E

In global terms, the following can be discerned: rivalry among major powers, with armed conflict between some not ruled out entirely; armed non-state actors strengthened by new technologies; global competition for natural resources; extensive <b>demographic</b> <b>imbalances</b> and migration flows; global risks associated with fragile states. In terms of European internal policy, the following trends are identified: population ageing and the challenges associated with immigrant integration; empowerment of interest-based and identity networks.

The key uncertainties referred to in the pages above include the speed and extent of the impact of climate change, the degree of cooperation or rivalry between the major powers, technological advances in artificial intelligence, the repetition of new economic crises which could spread easily in an interdependent world, and the type of harm caused by a new regional or even global terrorist organisation (a reborn Al Qaeda, for instance). All these factors could materialise to different degrees and would affect other variables, triggering various effects, which would not all be easy to predict.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper is twofold. First, the possible links between the feared decrease {{of the formation of}} savings and the strong territorial imbalances that characterised the demographic evolution are examined. Second, the authors aim to demonstrate that it makes sense {{to address the problem of}} lack of savings in the global economy above all if it is seen in relative terms, comparing it with the specific investment needs that must be met in order to mitigate economic and <b>demographic</b> <b>imbalances.</b> Attention is focused on a specific and particularly significant aspect of the problem: that of the relationship between family savings and optimal accumulation of human capital at different stages of economic development and population growth. The authors conclude that more than a problem of absolute world savings scarcity, there is a predominant redistributive problem, in the face of a marked economic and demographic dualism that takes on a worrisome destabilising potential.   JEL Codes: E 21, J 24, O 16  </p...|$|R
