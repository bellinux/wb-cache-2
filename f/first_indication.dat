5|$|The Cat's Eye was {{the first}} {{planetary}} nebula to be observed with a spectroscope by William Huggins on August 29, 1864. Huggins' observations revealed that the nebula's spectrum was non-continuous and made of a few bright emission lines, <b>first</b> <b>indication</b> that planetary nebulae consist of tenuous ionised gas. Spectroscopic observations at these wavelengths are used in abundance determinations, while images at these wavelengths {{have been used to}} reveal the intricate structure of the nebula.|$|E
5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>indication</b> of {{a change}} in weather was the sudden {{collapse}} of the market for specialized AI hardware in 1987. Desktop computers from Apple and IBM had been steadily gaining speed and power and in 1987 they became more powerful than the more expensive Lisp machines made by Symbolics and others. There was no longer a good reason to buy them. An entire industry worth half a billion dollars was demolished overnight.|$|E
5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>indication</b> of domesticated {{horses in}} England comes from archaeological {{investigations}} {{showing that the}} ancient Britons were using wheeled horse-drawn transport extensively in southwest England as early as 400 BC. Recent {{research has indicated that}} there was significant Roman involvement in mining on Exmoor. Metals including iron, tin, and copper were transported to Hengistbury Head in neighbouring Dorset for export, and Roman carvings, showing British and Roman chariots pulled by ponies phenotypically similar to the Exmoor, have been found in Somerset.|$|E

5|$|A ship sunk in {{the western}} Gulf of Mexico on October1, which was the <b>first</b> <b>indication</b> of the second {{tropical}} cyclone of the season. The storm moved slowly northeastward toward the southeastern Louisiana coastline, intensifying to its estimated peak winds of 70mph (115km/h). On October4, it passed near or over southeastern Louisiana, producing heavy rain and gusty winds in New Orleans. Flooding was observed in portions of the city, and the West Rigolets Lighthouse on Lake Pontchartrain suffered $5,000 in damage due to the storm (1868USD, $81,000 2010USD). The storm accelerated northeastward and struck near Apalachicola, Florida late on October4.|$|E
5|$|During the {{afternoon}} of July 16, 1904, a severe thunderstorm produced a strong tornado that touched down around 3:30pm EST in Chappaqua, New York. Residents reported the <b>first</b> <b>indication</b> of the thunderstorm was a large black cloud approaching the region. The sky was reportedly completely dark as torrential rain and high winds commenced. Intense lightning and loud thunder prompted people to seek shelter in their cellars. The tornado tracked directly through Chappaqua before moving towards the Hudson River. Upon reaching the river, the tornado became a waterspout that was powerful enough to uncover the river bed below it. The waterspout eventually dissipated by 4:00pm EST. The tornado was later rated as F3 on the modern-day Fujita scale.|$|E

5|$|Marrella was {{the first}} Burgess Shale fossil that Whittington re-examined, and gave the <b>first</b> <b>indication</b> that surprises were on the way. Although clearly an {{arthropod}} that walked on the sea-floor, Marella {{was very different from}} the known marine arthropod groups (trilobites, crustaceans and chelicerates) in the structure of its legs and gills, and above all in the number and positions of the appendages on its head, which are the main feature used to classify arthropods. A fossil of Marrella from the Burgess Shale has also provided the earliest clear evidence of molting.|$|E
5|$|Vizzini {{offered to}} meet with Aldisio – who had been {{appointed}} High Commissioner in August 1944 – to solve the island’s grain problem, implying he {{had the power to}} do so. There is no evidence that Aldisio and Vizzini ever met to discuss the issue. Aldiso did, however, invite , a fellow Christian Democrat and Mafia member befriended by Vizzini, to secret gatherings with Christian Democrats. The meetings were seen as a first step in a government alliance with the Mafia. Aldisio’s appointment was perceived by Mafia chieftains as a <b>first</b> <b>indication</b> of the government’s determination to subdue the separatist movement. They were now forced to reconsider their support.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} storm was first observed by a ship about 835mi (1,345km) northeast of Cayenne, French Guiana, early on August6, according to historic weather maps. However, {{the scarcity of}} observations means that its genesis may have occurred earlier than this time and been undetected operationally. With initial winds of 60mph (95km/h), the system moved generally west-northwestward and strengthened into Category1 hurricane on the modern day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale about 24hours later. The <b>first</b> <b>indication</b> of the storm {{to the east of}} Barbados was on August8 via telegraph reports. Early on August9, the cyclone struck Martinique as either a strong Category1 or a weak Category2 hurricane. The storm entered the Caribbean Sea shortly thereafter. Around 12:00UTC, the cyclone intensified into a Category3 hurricane, becoming the first major hurricane in the Atlantic basin since the second storm of 1900 and the first in the Caribbean Sea since the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane.|$|E

5|$|During the Prussian {{invasion}} of Hesse in June 1866, Victoria and Elisabeth {{were sent to}} England {{to live with their}} grandmother until hostilities were ended by the absorption of Hesse-Kassel and parts of Hesse-Darmstadt into Prussia. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, military hospitals were set up in the palace grounds at Darmstadt, and she helped in the soup kitchens with her mother. She remembered the intense cold of the winter, and being burned on the arm by hot soup. In 1872, Victoria's eighteen-month-old brother, Friedrich, was diagnosed with haemophilia. The diagnosis came as a shock to the royal families of Europe; it had been twenty years since Queen Victoria had given birth to her haemophiliac son, Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, and it was the <b>first</b> <b>indication</b> that the bleeding disorder in the royal family was hereditary. The following year, Friedrich fell from a window onto stone steps and died. It was the first of many tragedies to beset the Hesse family.|$|E
5|$|In Moscow, between November and December 1964, at two {{sessions}} of the Presidium of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee, Soviet leaders discussed {{the topic of}} Soviet military aid to North Vietnam. Although details of the discussions were not made public, the <b>first</b> <b>indication</b> of Soviet strategy in Vietnam came on 24 December 1964, when the Soviet government invited the North Vietnamese-backed National Liberation Front to open a permanent mission in Moscow. Then on 4 February 1965 McGeorge Bundy, national security adviser to President Johnson, arrived in Saigon {{to meet with the}} then U.S. Ambassador to South Vietnam, General Maxwell Taylor, to discuss the political situation in the country. Two days later on 6 February 1965, Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin arrived in Hanoi for a historic visit to North Vietnam, included in his entourage was a team of Soviet missile experts.|$|E
5|$|In the Late Archaic {{the climate}} became {{more similar to}} modern {{with the end of}} the Hypsithermal. The number of Late Archaic Sites {{increased}} in Iowa, perhaps reflective of increased populations allowed by climate change and new subsistence strategies. The Late Archaic sees the <b>first</b> <b>indication</b> of mound building in Iowa, as well as direct evidence of domesticated plants, and large, long-term settlements. The Red Ocher Culture appeared in northeast Iowa, associated with copper artifacts and mound building. Numerous Late Archaic sites have been excavated in eastern Iowa, some showing the gradual adaptation of cultigens, including squash, little barley, marsh elder, and barnyard grass. Sites with evidence for early cultigens in Iowa include the Edgewater Park Site in Coralville, the Gast Spring Site, and the Sand Run Slough West Site. In western Iowa, Late Archaic sites are common, however large bison killing or processing sites are less common than before, and there is little evidence for the use of domesticated plants.|$|E
50|$|The <b>first</b> <b>indications</b> {{of human}} {{settlement}} in the territory now covered by the Marinaleda municipality {{go back to the}} late Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods, about 5,000 years ago. Stone tools and traces of seeds and dwelling places have been found.|$|R
50|$|The <b>first</b> <b>indications</b> {{of modern}} human {{colonization}} {{of the interior}} and {{the west of the}} peninsula are found only in this cultural phase, with a few late Gravettian elements found in the Manzanares valley (Madrid) and Salemas cave (Alentejo, Portugal).|$|R
50|$|The {{region of}} Trikala has been {{inhabited}} since prehistoric times. The <b>first</b> <b>indications</b> of permanent settlement have been uncovered {{in the cave}} of Theopetra, and date back to approx. 49,000 BC. Neolithic settlements dating back to 6,000 BC have been uncovered in Megalo Kefalovriso and other locations.|$|R
5|$|The {{paintings}} depict isolated figures {{enclosed in}} spaces that are undefined, overwhelmingly claustrophobic, reductive and eerie. Coming early in Bacon's career, they are uneven in quality, but show a clear progression especially {{in how they}} utilise and present ideas he was still clearly developing and coming to terms with. Head I (actually begun {{in the winter of}} 1948) and Head II show formless pieces of flesh that broadly resemble human heads; they have half-open eyes and a pharynx, though it is positioned much higher than would be expected in a human. Heads III, IV and V show fully formed busts recognisable as men, and are characterised by a haunted atmosphere. These two broad ideas coalesce in Head VI, which is as physiologically tortured as the first two paintings, and as spectral as the middle three. In Head VI the figure has developed and is now shown wearing vestments, the <b>first</b> <b>indication</b> in Bacon's work of the influence of Velázquez, while the focus has become the open mouth and the study of the human scream.|$|E
5|$|Wodehouse's {{family and}} friends had not had any news of his {{location}} {{after the fall of}} France, but an article from an Associated Press reporter who had visited Tost in December 1940 led to pressure on the German authorities to release the novelist. This included a petition from influential people in the US; Senator W.Warren Barbour presented it to the German ambassador. Although his captors refused to release him, Wodehouse was provided with a typewriter and, to pass the time, he wrote Money in the Bank. Throughout his time in Tost, he sent postcards to his US literary agent asking for $5 to be sent to various people in Canada, mentioning his name. These were the families of Canadian prisoners of war, and the news from Wodehouse was the <b>first</b> <b>indication</b> that their sons were alive and well. Wodehouse risked severe punishment for the communication, but managed to evade the German censor.|$|E
5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>indication</b> of {{the wing}} buds is of a {{thickening}} of the hypodermis, which {{can be observed in}} insect species as early the embryo, and in the earliest stages of the life cycle. During the development of morphological features while in the embryo, or embryogenesis, a cluster of cells grow underneath the ectoderm which later in development, after the lateral ectoderm has grown dorsally to form wind imaginal disc. An example of wing bud development in the larvae, can be seen in those of White butterflies (Pieris). In the second instar the histoblast become more prominent, which now form a pocket-like structure. As of the third and fourth instars, the histoblast become more elongated. This greatly extended and evaginated, or protruding, part is what becomes the wing. By the close of the last instar, or fifth, the wing is pushed out {{of the wing}}-pocket, although continues to lie under the old larval cuticle while in its prepupal stage. It is not until the butterfly is in its pupal stage that the wing-bud becomes exposed, and shortly after eclosion, the wing begins to expand and form its definitive shape.|$|E

5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>indication</b> of the franchises' displeasure {{with their}} parent {{over this issue}} came in 2005 and {{involved}} claims by a Manhattan-based franchise that the company failed {{to take into account}} local market conditions when setting prices. E-Z Eating Corp., operator of five restaurants in New York and owned by brother-sister partners Elizabeth and Luan Sadik, had been struggling after the 9/11 terrorist attacks but had been in a company-sponsored turn around program when Burger King started its new value program in 2006. The program required all locations to carry a specific set of products at a discounted price, with limited exemptions for certain locations that met a set of criteria. The Sadiks applied for an exemption to the pricing requirement but were turned down by Burger King. In response to the denial, the Sadiks closed two of their locations without consulting Burger King and refused to implement the scheme in their other two locations. Burger King responded by suing the company in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida for breach of contract, and eventually revoked the franchise agreement for the remaining two locations in January 2006. The Sadik's responded by filing their own lawsuit in 2008 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York claiming that Burger King had engaged in a breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair in its actions towards the franchise. The actions were eventually consolidated in a single case in the Southern District Court under Judge Maricia G. Cooke, where Burger King requested and was granted a summary judgement against the Sadiks. The judgment was upheld on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in June 2009.|$|E
