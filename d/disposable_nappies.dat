25|$|Following the {{beaching}} of the MSC Napoli, as {{a result}} of severe damage incurred during European storm Kyrill, there was confusion in the press and by the authorities about whether people could be prevented from helping themselves to the flotsam which was washed up on the beaches at Branscombe. Many people took advantage of the confusion and helped themselves to the cargo. This included many BMW motorbikes and empty wine casks as well as bags of <b>disposable</b> <b>nappies</b> (diapers). The legal position under the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 is that any such finds and recovery must be reported within 28 days to the Receiver of Wreck. Failure to do so is an offence under the Merchant Shipping Act and can result in a criminal record for theft by finding. After several days, the police and Receiver of Wreck, in conjunction with the landowner and the contracted salvors, established a cordon to prevent access to the beach. A similar situation occurred after the wreck of the MV Cita in 1997.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES Male {{reproductive}} health has deteriorated in recent decades. It is proposed that increased testicular temperature in early childhood, {{due to the}} use of modern <b>disposable</b> plastic lined <b>nappies</b> (diapers), could be an important factor contributing to this decline. STUDY DESIGN Scrotal skin temperature was measured non-invasively in 48 healthy children aged 0 - 55 months (three age groups) for two 24 hour periods in randomised order (either cotton or <b>disposable</b> plastic lined <b>nappies)</b> using a portable, miniature recorder. RESULTS Mean 24 hour scrotal temperature (2880 measurements) was significantly higher in all age groups during the periods of plastic nappy use than with cotton nappies (p < 0. 001). The rectoscrotal temperature difference was significantly higher with cotton than with plastic nappy use (p < 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS Scrotal hypothermia is an important factor for normal spermatogenesis. This study shows that scrotal temperature, which closely reflects testicular temperature, is increased in boys wearing <b>disposable</b> plastic lined <b>nappies.</b> The physiological testicular cooling mechanism is blunted and often completely abolished during plastic nappy use. The present results establish the basis for further research on the impact of increased testicular temperature in infancy on later spermatogenesis...|$|R
40|$|To {{help prevent}} <b>disposable</b> <b>nappy</b> (DN) solid waste, the ‘Women's Environmental Network’ (WEN) {{developed}} the 'Real Nappies for London' (RNfL) scheme. In partnership with Local Authorities (LA), RNfL promotes {{the use of}} real nappies (RN) within 9 Boroughs of London, preventing the use of 4, 290 DNs per child, from new born to 2. 5 years of age. The scheme issued a voucher to residents who registered, redeemable for the average value of £ 45 against the purchase of RN products. Over a period of 4 years from 2012 to 2016 RNfL issued 4, 192 vouchers, of which 3, 188 were redeemed, resulting in 3, 145 tonnes of DN waste prevention. The 2012 - 2016 performance equated to a combined LA saving of £ 320, 791 based on an average landfill tax of £ 84 /t and disposal cost of £ 18 /t across LAs in England. Cost to Las for RNfL voucher processing is £ 28, 690 (£ 9 /voucher), achieving a cost effective ratio of 1 : 11. RNs are a valuable waste prevention tool working {{at the top of}} the waste hierarchy, in LAs. The resident network, built by the RNfL scheme, also provides a channel for LAs to communicate important waste messages to residents at low to no cost...|$|R

40|$|Background: The UK health service, {{nursing homes}} and public spend around £ 94 million per year on {{incontinence}} pads (absorbent products) to contain urine and/or faeces, but the research base for making informed choices between different product designs is very weak. Objectives: The aim of this trial was to compare the performance and cost-effectiveness of the key absorbent product designs {{to provide a more}} solid basis for guiding selection and purchase. A further aim was to carry out the first stage {{in the development of a}} quality of life instrument for measuring the impact of absorbent product use on users' lives. Design: The work involved three clinical trials focusing on the three biggest market sectors. Each trial had a similar crossover design in which each participant tested all products within their group in random order. Settings, participants and methods: In Trial 1, 85 women with light urinary incontinence living in the community tested three products from each of the four design categories available (total of 12 test products) : disposable inserts (pads); menstrual pads; washable pants with integral pad; and washable inserts. In Trial 2 a, 85 moderate/heavily incontinent adults (urinary or urinary/faecal) living in the community (49 men and 36 women) tested three (or two) products from each of the five design categories available (total of 14 test products) : disposable inserts (with mesh pants); disposable diapers (nappies); disposable pull-ups (similar to toddlers' trainer pants); <b>disposable</b> T-shaped diapers (<b>nappies</b> with waist-band); and washable diapers. All products were provided in a daytime and a (mostly more absorbent) night-time variant. In these first two trials, the test products were selected on the basis of data from pilot studies. In Trial 2 b, 100 moderate/heavily incontinent adults (urinary or urinary/faecal) living in 10 nursing homes (27 men and 73 women) evaluated one product from each of the four disposable design categories from Trial 2 a. Products were selected on the basis of product performance in Trial 2 a and, again, daytime and night-time variants were provided. The first phase of work to develop a quality of life tool for measuring the impact of using different pad designs was carried out by interviewing participants from Trials 1 and 2 a. Outcome measures: Product performance was characterised using validated questionnaires, which asked the participants (in Trials 1 and 2 a) or carers (all participants in Trial 2 b, except for the few who could report for themselves) to evaluate various aspects of pad performance (leakage, ease of putting on, discreetness, etc.) using a five-point scale (very good–very poor) at the end of the week (or 2 weeks for Trial 2 b) of product testing. In addition, participants/carers were asked to save individual used pads in bags for weighing and to indicate the severity of any leakage from them on a three-point scale (none, a little, a lot). These data were used to determine differences in leakage performance. Numbers of laundry items and pads used were recorded to estimate costs, and skin health changes were recorded by the participant or by the researchers (Trial 2 b). At the end of testing, participants were interviewed and ranked their preferences (with and without costs), stated the acceptability of each design (highly acceptable–totally unacceptable) and recorded their overall opinion on a visual analogue scale (VAS) of 0 – 100 points (worst design–best design). This VAS score was used with product costs to estimate cost-effectiveness. In addition, a timed pad changing exercise was conducted with 10 women from Trial 2 b to determine any differences between product designs.

Setting, participants and intervention: in Trial 1, 85 women with light urinary incontinence living in the community tested three products from each of the four design categories available (total of 12 test products) : disposable inserts (pads); menstrual pads; washable pants with integral pad; and washable inserts.

All products were provided in a daytime and a (mostly more absorbent) night-time variant. In these first two trials, the test products were selected on the basis of data from pilot studies. In Trial 2 b, 100 moderate/heavily incontinent adults (urinary or urinary/faecal) living in 10 nursing homes (27 men and 73 women) evaluated one product from each of the four disposable design categories from Trial 2 a. Products were selected on the basis of product performance in Trial 2 a and, again, day time and night-time variants were provided. The first phase of developing a QoL tool for measuring the impact of using different pad designs was carried out by interviewing participants from Trials 1 and 2 a. Main outcome measures: product performance (e. g. comfort, discreetness) was characterised using a weekly validated questionnaire. A daily pad change and leakage diary was used to record severity of leakage, numbers of laundry items and pads. Skin health changes were recorded weekly. At a final interview preferences were ranked, acceptability of each design recorded, and overall opinion marked on a visual analogue scale (VAS) of 0 - 100 points. This VAS score was used to estimate cost-effectiveness. In addition, a timed pad changing exercise was conducted with 10 women from Trial 2 b to determine any differences between product designs. Results: disposable inserts are currently the mainstay of management for lightly incontinent women (Trial 1) and they were better for leakage and other variables (but not discreetness) and better overall than the other three designs. However, some women preferred menstrual pads (6 / 85) or washable pants (13 / 85), both of which are cheaper to use. Washable inserts were worse both overall and for leakage than the other three designs (72 / 85 found them unacceptable). For disposable inserts and disposable diapers, findings from the community (Trial 2 a) and nursing home trials (Trial 2 b) were broadly similar. Leakage performance of disposable inserts was worse than that of the other designs for day and night. Pull-ups were preferred over inserts for the daytime. The new T-shaped diaper was not better overall than the traditional disposable one. However, there were important differences in performance and preference findings for men and women from both trials. Pull-ups (the most expensive) were better overall than the other designs for women during the day and for community-dwelling women during the night. Although disposable diapers were better for leakage than disposable inserts (the cheapest), women did not prefer them (except in nursing homes at night), but for men the diapers were better both overall and for leakage and were the most cost-effective design. No firm conclusions could be drawn about the performance of designs for faecal incontinence. Nursing home carers found pull-ups and inserts easier to apply (in the standing position) and quicker (in the pad change experiment) than the diaper designs; the ability to stand was associated with preference for pull-ups or inserts. The T-shaped diaper was not easier or quicker to change than the diaper. The washable products (Trial 2 a) gave diverse results: they were better for leakage at night, but were worse overall for daytime than the other designs. Three-quarters of the women (27 / 36) found them unacceptable, but nearly two-thirds of men (31 / 49) found them highly acceptable at night. Findings from the two community trials (Trials 1 and 2 a) showed that there were many practical problems in dealing with washable products but, together with the less effective and less expensive products, such as menstrual pads, they were more acceptable at home (and, in the case of washables, at night). This suggests that cost-effective management may involve combining products by using more effective (for a given user) but more expensive designs (e. g. pull-ups) when out and less effective but less expensive designs when at home. The interviews examining the impact of pad use on QoL provided themes and domains that can be further developed into a tool for further evaluation of absorbent products. Conclusions: this study showed that there were significant and substantial differences between the designs of absorbent products and for moderate/heavy incontinence some designs are better for men/women than others. There was considerable individual variability in preferences and cost-effective management may best be achieved by allowing users to choose combinations of designs for different circumstances within a budget. Further research is needed into the feasibility of providing choice and combinations of designs to users, as well as into the development of more effective washables and of specifically male disposable products. QoL measurement tools are needed for users of absorbent products, as are clinical trials of designs for community-dwelling carer-dependent men and women with moderate/heavy incontinence <br/...|$|R
5000|$|The {{method of}} holding a baby out {{to trigger the}} reflex to urinate and defecate has presumably been used by mothers since the first homo-sapiens. The English doctor Pye Henry Chavasse {{suggested}} in his 1839 book [...] "Advice to a Mother on the Management of her Children", that the baby should be held out over a pot {{at least a dozen}} times a day at 3 months old; if this were done, there need be no more nappies at 4 months. In 1912 Edward Mansfield Brockbank advised that babies should be supported on the pot from two months old.The practise was commonplace up until the fifties, when Dr Spock's method of delaying the start of toilet training until 18 months became popular.

Conclusion: Our results show no statistically significant difference in TSB level change using either nursing practice...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Nappy rash {{accounts}} for 20 % of dermatology consultations in childhood, but its causes are poorly understood. AIM: To determine {{the incidence of}} nappy rash during the first four weeks {{of life in a}} geographically defined United Kingdom (UK) population, and to study the factors associated with developing the rash. METHOD: The data are derived from self-completed questionnaires of parents in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood (ALSPAC). The response rate to a questionnaire about the child administered four weeks after delivery among parents of singleton infants was 87 % (12103 / 13902). RESULTS: The incidence of nappy rash was 25 %. Fourteen highly significant possible causal factors emerged, of which 10 were retained in a logistic regression model: dirtying of nappy, contact with doctor about other problems, history of rashes in joints or skin creases, type of nappy worn, being fed cereal, taken to mother's bed when waking at night, history of cradle cap, general state of health, previous stomach upset, and being only breast-fed. However, the relative risks were generally small. CONCLUSIONS: The likelihood of nappy rash increases with intercurrent illness and early introduction of cereals. <b>Disposable</b> <b>nappies</b> give little protection, and this finding helps to endorse a recently introduced hospital scheme arising from environmental concerns that encourages parents to use cotton nappies instead of disposables. For many babies, however, the causes of nappy rash remain unknown...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} the studies were waste {{generated}} in suburban households, in 3 -bag system. The sum of wastes generated during the four analyzed seasons (spring, summer, autumn, winter – 1 year), in the households under study, per 1 person, amounted to 170, 3 kg (in wet mass basis). For 1 person, most domestic waste was generated in autumn – 45, 5 kg per capita and the least in winter – 39, 0 kg per capita. The analysis performed of sieved composition (size fraction) showed that fractions: > 100 mm, 40 – 100 mm, 20 – 40 mm constituted totally 80 % {{of the mass of}} wastes (average in a year). The lowest fraction (< 10 mm), whose significant part constitutes ashes, varied depending on the season of year: from 3. 5 % to 12. 8 %. In the morphological composition of the households analyzed (on average in 4 seasons), biowastes totally formed over 53 % of the whole mass of wastes. A significant part of waste generated were also glass waste (10, 7 % average per year) and <b>disposable</b> <b>nappies</b> (8, 3 % average per year). The analysis of basic chemical components of biowastes showed that in case of utilizing them for production of compost, it would be necessary to modify (correct) the ratios C/N and C/P. Analysis of the chemical composition showed that the biowastes were characterized by very high moisture content and neutral pH...|$|E
40|$|To provide {{mother with}} the {{information}} on community support to enable her to successfully breastfeed her baby at home. KEY POINTS 1. Any baby unable to attach,fully breastfeed or has weight loss> 10 % shall be reviewed by the paediatrician prior to discharge and have follow up at the breastfeeding centre or community health midwife. 2. Prior to going home ensure the mother: � has been instructed on how to position her baby at the breast correctly. Those women whose baby not able to achieve attachment, or who have damaged nipples will need electric breast pump hire arranged and follow up at the Breastfeeding Centre. � is aware of hand expressing technique and has written information {{in the form of}} a booklet: Breastfeeding and Breast care. Midwives will ensure each woman has this booklet postnatally. � understands the concepts of let down reflex, baby led feeding, demand/supply breastfeeding � understands that the baby should feed 8 - 12 times in 24 hours � recognises effective nutritive sucking pattern of breastfed baby � recognises her baby’s feeding cues � is aware of settling techniques for her baby � recognises signs of adequate hydration of fully breast fed babies. 1, 2 For the first 1 - 2 days the baby only has 1 - 3 wet nappies per 24 hours and should pass several meconium stools. 3. Once the baby is receiving mature milk the mother should know to expect: � 6 - 8 wet cloth nappies (or 5 <b>disposable</b> <b>nappies)</b> � clear or pale urine � soft, yellow bowel actions, 2 - 3 per day in the first 4 - 6 weeks. 2 � bright eyes that are alert and clear � good skin tone � a period of wakeful contentment during the da...|$|E
40|$|The {{absorption}} cores in <b>disposable</b> <b>nappies,</b> incontinence {{pads and}} {{female hygiene products}} are manufactured by a dry mat-forming process. Cellulose fibers and super-absorbing particles are suspended in air and blown onto a forming wheel on which the cores are formed. It is vital {{for the quality of}} the product that the fibres and particles are evenly distributed in the suspension. The purpose of this project has been to establish a platform of scientific knowledge from which the fluid mechanics aspect of the manufacturing process can be understood. To better understand the problems relevant to the process, air/particle flows and air/fiber flows have been studied separately. A two-fluid model with a modified &# 954;-&# 949; model for the gas phase has been used to simulate a horizontal air/particle flow. An optical probe and a calibration procedure for measuring the local particle volume fraction have been developed and used to verify the models. The probe uses two optical fibres, to emit infrared light and detect light reflected by the particles. The calibration procedure {{is based on the assumption}} that light paths including reflections on more than one particle do not make a significant contribution to the probe signal. Measurements of a horizontal air/particle flow have been made to verify the simulations. The agreement between simulations and experiments is good. For the air/fiber flow, it is suggested that a two-fluid model be used together with a turbulence model for the gas phase and a transport equation for a floc characterizing scalar. This scalar may be either flocculation intensity or floc size. A technique for characterizing the flow using optical probes has been developed. Measurements of floc velocity and size distributions have been made in a production-scale facility for process research. The shape of the measured floc size distribution indicates that the mechanism for aggregating fibres into flocs is strong compared to the mechanism for breaking up flocs...|$|E
