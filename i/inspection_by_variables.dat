The single {{sampling plans}} for the <b>inspection</b> <b>by</b> <b>variables</b> and for the <b>inspection</b> <b>by</b> <b>variables</b> and attributes (all items from the sample are inspected by variables, remainder of rejected lots is inspected by attributes) were then proposed. Under the same protection of consumer the LTPD plans for <b>inspection</b> <b>by</b> <b>variables</b> are in many situations more economical than the corresponding sampling plans for inspection by attributes.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we shall {{deal with the}} AOQL single {{sampling}} plans when the remainder of rejected lots is inspected. We shall consider two types of AOQL plans – for <b>inspection</b> <b>by</b> <b>variables,</b> and for <b>inspection</b> <b>by</b> <b>variables</b> and attributes (all items from the sample are inspected by variables, remainder of rejected lots is inspected by attributes) – see Klufa (1997). These plans we shall compare with the corresponding Dodge-Romig AOQL plans by attributes. From the results of numerical investigations it follows (see Klufa (2008)) that under the same protection of consumer the AOQL plans for <b>inspection</b> <b>by</b> <b>variables</b> are in many situations more economical than the corresponding Dodge-Romig attribute sampling plans (saving of the inspection cost is 70 % in any cases). The calculation of these new plans is considerably difficult (in Klufa (2008) is only approximate solution). The problem of finding the optimal sampling plan for <b>inspection</b> <b>by</b> <b>variables</b> we shall solve in this paper by original method...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{concerns}} the acceptance sampling plans when {{the remainder of}} rejected lots is inspected. Two types of AOQL plans are considered – for <b>inspection</b> <b>by</b> <b>variables</b> and for <b>inspection</b> <b>by</b> <b>variables</b> and attributes (all items from the sample are inspected by variables, the remainder of rejected lots is inspected by attributes). These plans are compared with the corresponding Dodge–Romig AOQL plans for inspection by attributes. An algorithm allowing the calculation of these plans (with the use of software Mathematica) was presented.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis recommends certain {{changes in the}} procedures and formatting of Military Standard 414 (Sampling Procedure and Tables for <b>Inspection</b> <b>by</b> <b>Variable</b> for Percent Defective) to bring its presentation in parallel with Military Standard 105 D (Sampling Procedures and Tables for <b>Inspection</b> <b>by</b> Attributes) {{and to make the}} variables standard easier to use. The procedural changes involve eliminating the Form 1 procedure of the present standard and eliminating the average range method of estimating the lot standard deviation. The format changes involve relabeling the inspection levels, regrouping the lot size ranges, and relabeling the sample size code letters. Additions to the switching procedure for tightened and reduced inspection are also suggested. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|A {{high-resolution}} echosounder {{was used}} to acquire seismo-acoustic records of P. oceanica dead matte patches in the Gulf of Palermo. Seismo-acoustic profiling enabled detection of dead matte structures that are invisible to visual <b>inspection,</b> being hidden <b>by</b> <b>variable</b> layers of sandy sediment. The thickness of the dead matte measured reaches a maximum of 2. 2 m. The mean volume of the matte per unit area of seabed surface (MEIx) varies from 0. 2 to 2. 2 m 3 /m 2, with an average value of 1. 6 m 3 /m 2 and a total volume estimated at 73, 000 m 3. From literature data and from the volume of dead matte calculated in the present work we estimated that total carbon accumulated in the matte is about 2, 484 tons. Seismo-acoustic technologies proves to be a powerful, non-destructive method to measure the thickness, extension, volume of dead matte and its potential carbon content...|$|R

40|$|Conformity {{assessment}} {{of the distribution of}} the values of a quantity is investigated by using a Bayesian approach. The effect of systematic, non-negligible measurement errors is taken into account. The analysis is general, {{in the sense that the}} probability distribution of the quantity can be of any kind, that is even different from the ubiquitous normal distribution, and the measurement model function, linking the measurand with the observable and non-observable influence quantities, can be non-linear. Further, any joint probability density function can be used to model the available knowledge about the systematic errors. It is demonstrated that the result of the Bayesian analysis here developed reduces to the standard result (obtained through a frequentistic approach) when the systematic measurement errors are negligible. A consolidated frequentistic extension of such standard result, aimed at including the effect of a systematic measurement error, is directly compared with the Bayesian result, whose superiority is demonstrated. Application of the results here obtained to the derivation of the operating characteristic curves used for sampling plans for <b>inspection</b> <b>by</b> <b>variables</b> is also introduce...|$|E
40|$|Product {{control in}} {{statistical}} quality control is the methodology that deals with procedures for taking decisions about one or more lots of finished products manufactured by production processes. Sampling <b>inspection</b> <b>by</b> <b>variables</b> {{is one of the}} major classifications of product control and comprises procedures for deciding about the disposition of a lot of individual units based on sample measurements of units on a quality characteristic under study. These procedures are defined under the assumption that the quality characteristic is measurable on a continuous scale, and the functional form of the probability distribution must be known. Inspection procedures which have been developed under the implicit assumption that the quality characteristic is distributed as normal with the related properties are found in the literature of product control. The assumption of normality may not be realized often in practice, and it becomes indispensable to investigate the properties of sampling plans based on nonnormal distributions. In this paper, a single sampling plan by variables is formulated and evaluated when the quality characteristic is assumed to be distributed according to a Pareto distribution. A procedure is developed for determining the parameters of the plan for specified requirements to ensure protection to both the producer and consumer...|$|E
40|$|One-sided {{variables}} {{acceptance sampling}} plans {{such as the}} one presented in Schilling 1 assume that a quality characteristic of interest, X, has a normal distribution and that measurements are exact. However, when measurements contain error and standard plans are used, the probability of accepting a lot for a fixed population proportion nonconforming varies widely depending on the population and measurement error parameter values. In this dissertation we consider methods for variables acceptance sampling in the presence of measurement error and evaluate their performance under lower bound constraints on the population variance;In the late 19502 ̆ 7 s, David, Fay and Walsh 2 suggested a one-sided variables acceptance sampling method (David) for problems where the measurement error variance is known. A competitor to this plan (MLE) is one based on plugging maximum likelihood estimates for the parameters of the population into the normal cumulative distribution function and determining lot disposal based the on estimated proportion nonconforming. With great improvements in the speed of computers, other more computationally intensive plans can be compared with the earlier methods. This dissertation develops two other variables acceptance sampling plans (LRT 1 and LRT 2) where the accept/reject decision is based on the value of a likelihood ratio statistic;For a fixed sample size, each of the four plans is developed to guarantee a maximum producer 2 ̆ 7 s risk no larger than a pre-specified upper bound under the restriction that the ratio of population to measurement error variance is bounded below. The best plan gives the smallest maximum consumer 2 ̆ 7 s risk;The major findings are that the LRT 2 method generally yields smaller maximum consumer risks than the other three methods. (In some special cases, the David method yields smaller values.) This result is true across a variety of different combinations of plan parameters;Additionally, variations on the David and MLE methods are developed and compared for the situation where the measurement error variance is unknown, but can be estimated. Plans are developed for two different approaches to estimating the error variance. It is not clear which method is more useful because neither method out-performs the other in all situations. ftn 1 Schilling, Edward G.
