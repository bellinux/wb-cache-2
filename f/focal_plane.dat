5|$|The {{heart of}} the Fabry–Pérot {{interferometer}} {{is a pair of}} partially silvered glass optical flats spaced several millimeters to centimeters apart with the silvered surfaces facing each other. (Alternatively, a Fabry–Pérot etalon uses a transparent plate with two parallel reflecting surfaces.) As with the Fizeau interferometer, the flats are slightly beveled. In a typical system, illumination is provided by a diffuse source set at the <b>focal</b> <b>plane</b> of a collimating lens. A focusing lens produces what would be an inverted image of the source if the paired flats were not present; i.e. {{in the absence of the}} paired flats, all light emitted from point A passing through the optical system would be focused at point A'. In Fig.6, only one ray emitted from point A on the source is traced. As the ray passes through the paired flats, it is multiply reflected to produce multiple transmitted rays which are collected by the focusing lens and brought to point A' on the screen. The complete interference pattern takes the appearance of a set of concentric rings. The sharpness of the rings depends on the reflectivity of the flats. If the reflectivity is high, resulting in a high Q factor (i.e. high finesse), monochromatic light produces a set of narrow bright rings against a dark background. In Fig.6, the low-finesse image corresponds to a reflectivity of 0.04 (i.e. unsilvered surfaces) versus a reflectivity of 0.95 for the high-finesse image.|$|E

40|$|Future space {{missions}} {{are going to}} require large <b>focal</b> <b>planes</b> with many sensing arrays and {{hundreds of millions of}} pixels all read out at high data rates''. This will place unique demands on the electrical and electronics (EE) subsystem design and it will be critically important to have high technology readiness level (TRL) EE concepts ready to support such missions. One such omission is the Joint Dark Energy Mission (JDEM) charged with making precise measurements of the expansion rate of the universe to reveal vital clues about the nature of dark energy - a hypothetical form of energy that permeates all of space and tends to increase the rate of the expansion. One of three JDEM concept studies - the Dark Energy Space Telescope (DESTINY) was conducted in 2008 at the NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in Greenbelt, Maryland. This paper presents the EE subsystem framework, which evolved from the DESTINY science instrument study. It describes the main challenges and implementation concepts related to the design of an EE subsystem featuring multiple <b>focal</b> <b>planes</b> populated with dozens of large arrays and millions of pixels. The <b>focal</b> <b>planes</b> are passively cooled to cryogenic temperatures (below 140 K). The sensor mosaic is controlled by a large number of Readout Integrated Circuits and Application Specific Integrated Circuits - the ROICs/ASICs in near proximity to their sensor <b>focal</b> <b>planes.</b> The ASICs, in turn, are serviced by a set of "warm" EE subsystem boxes performing Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based digital signal processing (DSP) computations of complex algorithms, such as sampling-up-the-ramp algorithm (SUTR), over large volumes of fast data streams. The SUTR boxes are supported by the Instrument Control/Command and Data Handling box (ICDH Primary and Backup boxes) for lossless data compression, command and low volume telemetry handling, power conversion and for communications with the spacecraft.

25|$|Like {{the video}} camera, most {{sampling}} schemes are periodic; that is, {{they have a}} characteristic sampling frequency in time or in space. Digital cameras provide {{a certain number of}} samples (pixels) per degree or per radian, or samples per mm in the <b>focal</b> <b>plane</b> of the camera. Audio signals are sampled (digitized) with an analog-to-digital converter, which produces a constant number of samples per second. Some of the most dramatic and subtle examples of aliasing occur when the signal being sampled also has periodic content.|$|E
25|$|William Gascoigne was {{the first}} who {{commanded}} a chief advantage of the form of telescope suggested by Kepler: that a small material object could be placed at the common <b>focal</b> <b>plane</b> of the objective and the eyepiece. This led to his invention of the micrometer, and his application of telescopic sights to precision astronomical instruments. It was not till about {{the middle of the}} 17th century that Kepler's telescope came into general use: not so much because of the advantages pointed out by Gascoigne, but because its field of view was much larger than in the Galilean telescope.|$|E

This tower is still active. However, the first lighthouse of the city is located just outside the port, in Fort St. George campus. It was active from 1796 till 1844.

40|$|In {{the case}} of modern {{infrared}} <b>focal</b> <b>planes,</b> {{one of the major}} problems is related to the noise contribution of the cooled, impedance-matching device used as the preamplifier stage in the detector electronics system. An ideal preamp device should have the low-noise advantages of a buried-channel device and operate isothermally with the low-temperature detector array. The Ge JFET might provide this ideal device. A testing program with Ge JFETs is discussed. It is concluded that germanium JFETs offer an attractive alternative for cryogenic preamplifier designs. They operate well with high transconductance and low noise at LHe temperatures. It is believed that these devices point the way for the development of large, integrated-array, long wavelength, infrared <b>focal</b> <b>planes</b> which incorporate germanium detectors, germanium load resistors, and germanium preamplifiers within the same monolithic structure...|$|R
25|$|Even {{though the}} {{principles}} of focal ratio are always the same, the application to which the principle is put can differ. In photography the focal ratio varies the focal-plane illuminance (or optical power per unit area in the image) and is used to control variables such as depth of field. When using an optical telescope in astronomy, there is no depth of field issue, and the brightness of stellar point sources in terms of total optical power (not divided by area) {{is a function of}} absolute aperture area only, independent of focal length. The focal length controls the field of view of the instrument and the scale of the image that is presented at the <b>focal</b> <b>plane</b> to an eyepiece, film plate, or CCD.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{a positive}} or converging lens in air focuses a collimated beam travelling along the lens axis {{to a spot}} (known as the focal point) at a distance f from the lens. Conversely, a point source of light placed at the focal point is converted into a collimated beam by the lens. These two cases are examples of image formation in lenses. In the former case, an object at an infinite distance (as represented by a collimated beam of waves) is focused to an image at {{the focal point of}} the lens. In the latter, an object at the focal length distance from the lens is imaged at infinity. The plane perpendicular to the lens axis situated at a distance f from the lens is called the <b>focal</b> <b>plane.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ocular aberrations are {{generally}} measured using a wavefront sensor, {{and the most}} commonly used type of wavefront sensor is the Shack-Hartmann. Ocular aberrations are caused by spatial phase nonuniformities in the wavefront exiting the eye. In a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor, these are measured by placing a two-dimensional array of small lenses (lenslets) in a pupil plane conjugate to the eye's pupil, and a CCD chip at the back <b>focal</b> <b>plane</b> of the lenslets. The lenslets cause spots to be focused onto the CCD chip, and the positions of these spots are calculated using a centroiding algorithm. The positions of these spots are compared with the positions of reference spots, and the displacements between the two are used to determine the local curvature of the wavefront—an estimate of the phase nonuniformities causing aberration.|$|E

25|$|As {{previously}} stated, {{by adjusting}} the magnetic lenses such that the back <b>focal</b> <b>plane</b> of the lens rather than the imaging plane {{is placed on the}} imaging apparatus a diffraction pattern can be generated. For thin crystalline samples, this produces an image that consists of a pattern of dots {{in the case of a}} single crystal, or a series of rings in the case of a polycrystalline or amorphous solid material. For the single crystal case the diffraction pattern is dependent upon the orientation of the specimen and the structure of the sample illuminated by the electron beam. This image provides the investigator with information about the space group symmetries in the crystal and the crystal's orientation to the beam path. This is typically done without using any information but the position at which the diffraction spots appear and the observed image symmetries.|$|E
25|$|Framing camera (FC)— The framing camera uses 20mm aperture, f/7.9 {{refractive}} {{optical system}} with a focal length of 150mm. A frame-transfer charge-coupled device (CCD), a Thomson TH7888A, at the <b>focal</b> <b>plane</b> has 1024 × 1024 sensitive 93-μrad pixels, yielding a 5.5° x 5.5° field of view. An 8-position filter wheel permits panchromatic (clear filter) and spectrally selective imaging (7 narrow band filters). The broadest filter allows imaging at wavelengths ranging from 400 to 1050nm. In addition, the framing camera will acquire images for optical navigation while in the vicinities of Vesta and Ceres. The FC computer is a custom radiation-hardened Xilinx {{system with a}} LEON2 core and 8 GiB of memory. The camera will offer resolutions of 17 m/pixel for Vesta and 66 m/pixel for Ceres. Because the framing camera is vital for both science and navigation, the payload has two identical and physically separate cameras (FC1 & FC2) for redundancy, {{each with its own}} optics, electronics, and structure.|$|E
25|$|X-ray {{computed}} tomography (CT), or Computed Axial Tomography (CAT) scan, is a helical tomography technique (latest generation), which traditionally produces a 2D {{image of the}} structures in a thin section of the body. In CT, a beam of X-rays spins around an object being examined and is picked up by sensitive radiation detectors after having penetrated the object from multiple angles. A computer then analyses the information received from the scanner's detectors and constructs a detailed image of the object and its contents using the mathematical principles {{laid out in the}} Radon transform. It has a greater ionizing radiation dose burden than projection radiography; repeated scans must be limited to avoid health effects. CT is based on the same principles as X-Ray projections but in this case, the patient is enclosed in a surrounding ring of detectors assigned with 500-1000 scintillation detectors (fourth-generation X-Ray CT scanner geometry). Previously in older generation scanners, the X-Ray beam was paired by a translating source and detector. Computed tomography has almost completely replaced <b>focal</b> <b>plane</b> tomography in X-ray tomography imaging.|$|E
