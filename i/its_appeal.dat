5|$|Henry I's successors did not {{consider}} the royal touch fundamental, reducing its application. The ritual remained a marginal aspect of kingship until the 17th century, when <b>its</b> <b>appeal</b> grew to unprecedented proportions and when it suddenly became an object of scrutiny in literature.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} {{popular in the}} Thirteen Colonies of America, and <b>its</b> <b>appeal</b> survived the American War of Independence, copies being owned by Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and George Washington.|$|E
5|$|At the DAP, Hitler met Dietrich Eckart, {{one of the}} party's founders and {{a member}} of the occult Thule Society. Eckart became Hitler's mentor, exchanging ideas with him and {{introducing}} him to a wide range of Munich society. To increase <b>its</b> <b>appeal,</b> the DAP changed its name to the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (National Socialist German Workers Party; NSDAP). Hitler designed the party's banner of a swastika in a white circle on a red background.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} version received favourable reviews in Japan. GameWatch {{notes that the}} gameplay is interesting and the parody aspects of the game have <b>its</b> <b>appeals,</b> although the colourfulness of the characters might suppress the plot.|$|R

5000|$|In October 2009 {{the school}} {{was found to have}} [...] "significant faults" [...] with <b>its</b> <b>appeals</b> {{procedures}} when a government ombudsman found that members of its admissions panel were not properly trained and the clerks recording of the appeal was [...] "inadequate." ...|$|R
5|$|Branch's music {{regularly}} expresses {{religious and}} political themes emphasizing American exceptionalism. Her music has been well received among conservative commentators {{and members of the}} Tea Party movement for its political message. The use of Branch's music in the campaigns of Cain and Santorum has been seen as an indication of <b>its</b> <b>appeal</b> among outsider candidates. She has released nine singles and an EP, and is working on her debut album for release in 2013.|$|E
5|$|One of the year's best {{music videos}} was {{directed}} by Jay-Z and cost about zero dollars to make. The video has a similar impromptu charm to the many intimate, one-shot performance clips popularized by Vincent Moon's Take-Away Shows, <b>its</b> <b>appeal</b> compounded by the shock of seeing such a notoriously manicured superstar without embellishment. It's all quite endearing and personal – two words one might not often associate with this superhumanly talented and famous couple.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the book}} is on its face an {{adventure}} story, a major theme {{is the need for}} a love of education; through this, Milo applies what he has learned in school, advances in his personal development, and learns to love the life that previously bored him. Critics have compared <b>its</b> <b>appeal</b> to that of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and to L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.|$|E
50|$|In June 2014 the Texas Education Agency (TEA) revoked Honors Academy's charter, {{with funding}} {{to end in}} August that year. The TEA closed the school as part of Senate Bill 2, which targets charter schools that perform poorly in three year periods. Honors Academy {{exhausted}} <b>its</b> <b>appeals</b> with the TEA.|$|R
50|$|Because the CRC had {{attracted}} adverse {{attention from the}} government, {{with the potential to}} negatively affect reception of appeals in the Martinsville Seven case, the CRC withdrew from direct defense of Grayson in July 1950. But, the NAACP was unable to succeed with <b>its</b> <b>appeals.</b> All seven of the men were executed in February 1951.|$|R

5|$|From 2011 to 2015, {{the village}} was {{involved}} in an annexation proposal with the town of Ossining. A petition circulated in Ossining election districts 17 and 20 (comprising 1,600 people), which was signed by about 20 percent of the residents. The petition was filed in October 2013, and a public hearing was held with both government boards in December 2013. In March 2014, Briarcliff's board approved the proposal, and Ossining's board rejected it. In 2014, Briarcliff Manor {{was in the process}} of appealing the issue to the Appellate Division Court, though in May 2015 the Briarcliff board voted to discontinue <b>its</b> <b>appeal.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gough Whitlam {{saw that}} the party had little chance of being elected unless it could expand <b>its</b> <b>appeal</b> from the {{traditional}} working-class base to include the suburban middle class. He sought to shift control of the ALP from union officials to the parliamentary party, and hoped that even rank-and-file party members could be given {{a voice in the}} conference. In 1968, controversy erupted within the party when the executive refused to seat new Tasmanian delegate Brian Harradine, a Whitlam supporter who was considered a right-wing extremist. Whitlam resigned the leadership, demanding a vote of confidence from caucus. He defeated Cairns for the leadership in an unexpectedly close 38–32 vote. Despite the vote, the executive refused to seat Harradine.|$|E
5|$|Hand {{possessed a}} gift for the English language, and his {{writings}} are admired as legal literature. He rose to fame outside the legal profession in 1944 during World War II after giving a short address in Central Park that struck a popular chord in <b>its</b> <b>appeal</b> for tolerance. During a period when a hysterical fear of subversion divided the nation, Hand {{was viewed as a}} liberal defender of civil liberties. A collection of Hand's papers and addresses, published in 1952 as The Spirit of Liberty, sold well and won him new admirers. Even after he criticized the civil-rights activism of the 1950s Warren Court, Hand retained his popularity.|$|E

5|$|Initial public {{reaction}} to the May 18 eruption dealt a nearly crippling blow to tourism, an important industry in Washington. Not only was tourism down in the Mount St. Helens–Gifford Pinchot National Forest area, but conventions, meetings and social gatherings also were cancelled or postponed at cities and resorts elsewhere in Washington and neighboring Oregon not affected by the eruption. The adverse effect on tourism and conventioneering, however, proved only temporary. Mount St. Helens, perhaps because of its reawakening, has regained <b>its</b> <b>appeal</b> for tourists. The United States Forest Service and the State of Washington opened visitor centers and provided access for people to view the volcano's devastation.|$|E
5|$|Within 20 {{years of}} its construction, {{alterations}} were made that expanded the shops and changed the façades. By {{the end of the}} 18th century it had been damaged by floods, but it was rebuilt to a similar design. Over the next century alterations to the shops included cantilevered extensions on the bridge's north face. In the 20th century several schemes were carried out to preserve the bridge and partially return it to its original appearance, enhancing <b>its</b> <b>appeal</b> as a tourist attraction.|$|E
5|$|After Parliament was {{dissolved}} in June 1802, another election saw Coke again returned, although in a contested election that cost the candidates £35,000. With {{the death of}} William Pitt in 1806, the two Whig groups agreed to an alliance, which {{took the form of}} the Ministry of All the Talents; Fox was confirmed as Foreign Secretary, and Windham as Secretary for War and the Colonies. The government apparently offered Coke a peerage, which he refused, and primarily focused on the abolition of slavery, which was accomplished only after the death of Fox on 13 September 1806. Fox's death made Parliament lose some of <b>its</b> <b>appeal</b> to Coke, as they had been close friends. His attendance {{in the next two years}} was very limited, and the next occasion of note was his support of the Corn Laws, which were highly unpopular in Norfolk and led to him being physically attacked by a mob in 1815.|$|E
50|$|The Whig {{name had}} been discredited and abandoned, but former Whigs still needed to {{advertise}} that they were opposed to the Democrats. The Know Nothings had found that <b>its</b> <b>appeals</b> to anti-immigrant prejudice was faltering and their secrecy was made suspect, so they sought more open and more inclusive appeals to broaden a candidate's chances at the polls.|$|R
50|$|In 2006 {{the film}} This Film Is Not Yet Rated {{alleged that the}} MPAA gave {{preferential}} treatment to member studios {{during the process of}} assigning ratings, as well as criticizing the rating process for its lack of transparency. In response, the MPAA posted its ratings rules, policies, and procedures, as well as <b>its</b> <b>appeals</b> process, online.|$|R

5|$|Bakshi {{recognized}} Kricfalusi's talent, {{and wanted}} {{to put him in}} charge of a project that would showcase the young animator's skills. Bakshi and Kricfalusi co-wrote the screenplay Bobby's Girl as a take on the teen films of the era. Jeff Sagansky, president of production at TriStar Pictures, put up $150,000 to develop the project, prompting Bakshi to move back to Los Angeles. When Sagansky left TriStar, Bakshi was forced to pitch the film again, but the studio's new executives did not understand <b>its</b> <b>appeal</b> and cut off financing. Bakshi and Zingarelli began to develop a feature about Hollywood's Golden Age, and Bakshi Productions crewmembers worked on proposed cartoons influenced by pulp fiction. Bobby's Girl was reworked as a potential prime time series called Suzy's in Love, but attracted no serious interest.|$|E
5|$|Guardians of the Galaxy earned $11.2 {{million on}} its Thursday night pre-opening, surpassing Captain America: The Winter Soldiers gross ($10.2 million) {{for the biggest}} Thursday evening start for a movie in 2014. IMAX {{accounted}} for 17% of the total gross ($1.9 million), which was the biggest August pre-release in IMAX format. On its opening day, the film earned $37.8 million, including the Thursday night earnings. Guardians of the Galaxy was the number one movie during its opening weekend and grossed $94.3 million, setting an August weekend record. During the opening weekend, IMAX earnings amounted to $11.7 million and 3-D showings accounted for 45% of ticket sales. The film's success was partially attributed to <b>its</b> <b>appeal</b> to both genders: the opening weekend audience was 44% female, which is the biggest proportion ever for a MCU film; 55% of the opening-weekend audience was {{over the age of}} 25.|$|E
5|$|On 22 March, {{the vote}} on the second reading {{attracted}} a record 608 members, including the non-voting Speaker (the previous record was 530 members). Despite the high attendance, the second reading was approved by only one vote, and further progress on the Reform Bill was difficult. During the committee stage, Isaac Gascoyne put forward a motion objecting to provisions of the bill that reduced {{the total number of}} seats in the House of Commons. This motion was carried, against the government's wishes, by 8 votes. Thereafter, the ministry lost a vote on a procedural motion by 22 votes. As these divisions indicated that Parliament was against the Reform Bill, the ministry decided to request a dissolution and take <b>its</b> <b>appeal</b> to the people.|$|E
50|$|In 1996, Robotic Vision Systems, Inc. (RVSI) {{first brought}} a patent {{infringement}} lawsuit against VIEW Engineering {{related to the}} coplanarity measurement of packaged semiconductor devices. In 2000, RVSI's patent was finally declared invalid and the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California {{ruled in favor of}} VIEW Engineering.

50|$|On 22 April 2016, the FFU Committee {{announced}} that Metalist {{would not be}} allowed to participate in professional competitions because of its debts to its players. On 16 May 2016, the FFU Appeal Committee left in force the decision of the FFU Football Clubs Attestation Committee of 22 April 2016 and refused in issuing attestation for the next season for the club by declining <b>its</b> <b>appeals.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{success of}} the music {{produced}} by the movement and its passage from underground phenomenon to mainstream genre, prompted its main promoter Geoff Barton to declare the NWOBHM finished in 1981. He felt disappointed by the low quality of the new bands and frustrated by {{the ease with which}} record labels exploited enthusiasm for heavy metal. Coincidentally, in the same year, the Bandwagon was closed and the Prince of Wales pub was subsequently demolished to build a restaurant. Although the movement had lost some of <b>its</b> <b>appeal</b> for diehard fans, as evidenced by the increased popularity of American-influenced AOR releases on sales-based national polls, it retained enough vitality to launch a second wave of bands, which rose from the underground and released their first albums in 1982 and 1983.|$|E

40|$|In {{response}} to the German occupation of Belgium in World War I, future U. S. president Herbert Hoover {{and a handful of}} his colleagues in the mining engineer industry founded the Commission for Relief in Belgium (CRB). The CRB engineered one of the greatest relief movements in history partly on account of its successful public appeals; nevertheless, the success of these appeals has never been fully explained due to a remarkable dearth of scholarship on the topic. This paper seeks to fill in the gap by analyzing salient documents in the Mudd Family Papers, located in Honnold/Mudd Library’s Special Collections section. The artifacts ultimately evince that the CRB tailored <b>its</b> <b>appeals</b> to the American upper and middle classes, appropriating their respective motifs and lexicons to successfully mobilize both groups; that rumors of wartime atrocities against Belgian children augmented <b>its</b> <b>appeals</b> to the middle class; and that it issued targeted messages to its American supporters after the United States’ entry into World War I, maintaining vital public support. The findings of this paper promise to add invaluable knowledge to an exceedingly understudied historical subject...|$|R
