5|$|B.s. var.spinulosa 'Cherry Candles', bred by Bill Molyneux {{from the}} 'Birthday Candles' cultivar, is a compact plant growing to 45cm tall {{and up to}} 100cm across with cherry red-styled gold flowers, darker than its parent, 15cm <b>high</b> <b>by</b> 6cm across. It was {{released}} commercially in spring 2004, and granted PBR status in February 2005, after an application by Molyneux.|$|E
5|$|B.s. var.spinulosa 'Coastal Cushion' (= 'Schnapper Point') was {{originally}} collected by Neil Marriott and called 'Schnapper Point' {{from the same}} locality as 'Birthday Candles'. This is a more spreading plant to 50cm tall and up to 1.5–2m across with dark red-styled gold flowers (a couple of shades darker than 'Birthday Candles') 15cm <b>high</b> <b>by</b> 6cm across. It is propagated by Richard Anderson of Merricks Nursery. It {{appears to be more}} adaptable to points north than other dwarf forms – growing reliably in southeastern Queensland. This form can be very floriferous, with some plants sporting more than 40 inflorescences at any one time.|$|E
50|$|The ratio {{shift was}} {{accomplished}} by taking the W55 base ratios and changing the input shaft to intermediate shaft ratio by 7.9%, thus shifting 1, 2, 3 ratios <b>higher</b> <b>by</b> that amount. This also shifted the overdrive 5th gear <b>higher</b> <b>by</b> the same amount creating a wider and taller overdrive ratio.|$|R

5|$|B.s. var.spinulosa 'Golden Cascade' is {{yet another}} plant from the same {{locality}} as 'Birthday Candles'; this is more spreading again, to perhaps 30cm tall and up to 1.5–2m across with red-styled gold flowers 15cm <b>high</b> <b>by</b> 6cm across. It is also seen as B.spinulosa 'prostrate'. Propagated by Gondwana Nursery, this {{is a relatively new}} release.|$|E
5|$|Despite his injury, Federer {{finished}} the season on a <b>high</b> <b>by</b> defeating Richard Gasquet to clinch the Davis Cup for Switzerland {{for the first}} time in its history.

5|$|House {{prices in}} Weymouth and Portland are {{relatively}} <b>high</b> <b>by</b> UK standards, yet around {{average for the}} south of England—the average price of a detached house in 2010 was £303,622; semi-detached and terraced houses were cheaper, at £204,647 and £203,207 respectively, and an apartment or maisonette cost £155,056. The crime rate in Weymouth of 7.6 burglaries per 1000 households is {{lower than that of}} England and Wales (11.6 per 1000), but above that of Dorset (3.6 per 1000). Unemployment levels are low, particularly in summer, at 2.5% of the economically active population in July 2011, compared to the UK average of 7.7%.|$|E

He registered a 6.19 ERA, his highest ERA over a full season in his career. He also tied a career <b>high</b> <b>by</b> allowing 28 home runs.|$|E
5|$|Plante finally {{retired from}} hockey in 1975, {{after the death}} of his {{youngest}} son. He moved to Switzerland with his second wife, Raymonde Udrisard, but remained active on the North American hockey scene as an analyst, adviser, and goaltender trainer. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1978. In the fall of 1985, Plante was diagnosed with terminal stomach cancer. He died in a Geneva hospital in February 1986 and was buried in Sierre, Switzerland. When his coffin was carried from the church following the funeral mass, it passed under an arch of hockey sticks held <b>high</b> <b>by</b> a team of young hockey players from Quebec, visiting Switzerland for a tournament.|$|E

5|$|After {{the final}} hand, Lady Fingers {{questioned}} Howard {{how he could}} have made that $1000 raise, to which Howard replied that poker was all about making the wrong move at the right time. On third street, the Kid bet $1000 into a $1000 pot {{with a pair of}} 10s shows while Howard had just a Queen <b>high.</b> <b>By</b> raising $1000, Howard was possibly representing a Queen in the hole and trying to buy the pot at the point. The Kid only had to put in another $1000 into a $4000, so he was offered 4 to 1 odds, which were very favorable odds, since he only had to be right 1 in 5 times to break even. Howard seemed to be relying on implied odds to justify that raise as well as the $3000 call on fourth street.|$|E

5|$|In 1979, Swiss {{publisher}} Faksimile-Verlag Luzern requested {{permission to}} produce a full-colour facsimile of the book. Permission was initially denied, because Trinity College officials felt {{that the risk of}} damage to the book was too <b>high.</b> <b>By</b> 1986, Faksimile-Verlag had developed a process that used gentle suction to straighten a page so that it could be photographed without touching it and so won permission to publish a new facsimile. After each page was photographed, a single-page facsimile was prepared so the colours could be carefully compared to the original and adjustments made where necessary. The completed work was published in 1990 in a two-volume set containing the full facsimile and scholarly commentary. One copy is held by the Anglican Church in Kells, {{on the site of the}} original monastery.|$|E
5|$|In {{the season}} one finale, Shelby adopts Quinn and Puck's newborn daughter, Beth. She leaves Vocal Adrenaline before the {{beginning}} of the next school year. Shelby returns in the second episode of the third season, having been recruited to lead a second glee club at McKinley <b>High</b> <b>by</b> Sugar Motta's father when Sugar is refused entry into New Directions. Shelby offers to include both Quinn and Puck in Beth's life. Struggling at being a mother, she forms a romantic bond with eighteen-year-old student Puck, leading to a sexual relationship before she tells him that their relationship is a mistake and resigns from McKinley in the eighth episode. While Menzel's musical performances on the show have been lauded, Shelby's storylines were characterized as rushed, incomprehensible and polarizing by contemporary reviewers.|$|E
5|$|LeVert {{was named}} co-captain {{of the team}} along with Spike Albrecht. He opened the season with 9 assists against Hillsdale College on November 15, surpassing his {{previous}} career-high of five. On November 24, against Oregon, LeVert established a career <b>high</b> <b>by</b> making 11 free throws helping the team to a 7063 victory in the Legends Classic semifinal game. He posted a career-high 32 points and tied a career-high 4 steals on December 6 in an upset loss to NJIT. He posted 4 steals again against Minnesota on January 10. On January 17 against Northwestern, he reinjured the foot {{that he had had}} surgery on the prior May and was lost for the season. At the time of his injury, LeVert led Michigan in scoring (14.9), rebounds (4.9), assists (3.7), steals (1.7) and minutes (35.8).

5|$|Like its predecessor, no {{official}} album accompanied the motion picture; however, there are ten songs {{featured in the}} film itself and two music videos embedded in its subsequent home release. Two singles of The Sounds, Dance with Me and Rock 'n Roll, were promoted on Kimberly's car stereo. Besides these, the music video of Seven Days a Week accompanied the film's DVD. Middle of Nowhere by The Blank Theory was both heard on Evan's car radio and inserted in the DVD along with its music video. Rocky Mountain <b>High</b> <b>by</b> John Denver was covered twice in the end credits by Pete Snell and Jude Christodal. Christodal also performed My Name is Death during Brian's death and the end credits. Other songs integrated were Highway to Hell by AC/DC (on Kimberly's car AV), Jon F.

5|$|Near Tczew, {{with about}} 7,800 men—including 2,500 cavalry and hussars, the Commonwealth's elite heavy cavalry—Koniecpolski {{tried to stop}} the Swedish army from {{reaching}} Danzig. On 7–8 August, he encountered a Swedish force consisting of 10,000 men, which included 5,000 infantry, near the swamps of Motława. The Swedes wanted to provoke the Poles into attacking, then destroy them with infantry fire and artillery, but Koniecpolski decided against attacking. The Swedes then went on the attack with cavalry, but were unable to draw the Poles within range of their fire. The Swedish attacks dealt severe damage to the Polish cavalry but did not cripple the Polish army whose morale was kept <b>high</b> <b>by</b> Koniecpolski. The battle ended when Gustavus Adolphus was again wounded and the Swedes retreated.|$|E
5|$|The {{mating season}} lasts from August to February, and {{coincides with the}} arrival of the rainy season in {{northern}} Australia. The female does the bulk of the nest building, although the male does assist; this is unusual for the genus Malurus. Concealed in grass tussocks or low shrubs, the spherical nest is constructed of dried grasses and usually lined with smaller, finer grasses and hair. Nests examined in southeast Queensland tended to be larger and untidier than those in northern Australia; the former measured 1215cm <b>high</b> <b>by</b> 912cm wide and bore a partly covered 36cm diameter entrance, whereas the latter average around 1013cm in height by 68cm wide with a 24cm entrance. Construction takes around one week, and there may be an interval of up to another seven days before eggs are laid. The eggs produced are white with reddish-brown spots in clutches of three to four, and measure 14.517 x 1013mm; those of subspecies melanocephalus are a little larger than those of cruentatus. The eggs are incubated for two weeks by the female alone. The nestlings are hidden under cover for one week after hatching. The juveniles depend on parents and helpers for approximately one month. They learn to fly between 1112days after hatching. Broods hatched earlier in the season will help to raise the broods hatched later on. They will stay as a clutch group for the season after hatching.|$|E
