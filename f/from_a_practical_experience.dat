40|$|The paper {{describes}} a system development simulation in which failure and escalation {{are introduced to}} Information System students. The simulation forms part of a learning methodology that guides the students through the failure and escalating experience and learning from that experience. The learning methodology described and further developed in this paper is the eclectic combination of various aspects of Problem based learning, Interactive multimedia, Experiential learning and Role playing. The learning methodology is called PIER (an acronym for Problem based learning, Interactive learning, Experiential learning and Role play). The methodology places emphasis on genuine interaction and uses interactive multimedia simulation to support group discussions and interaction. Different events are used to simulate real life occurrences {{that will lead to}} escalation and ultimately to failure. The paper discusses results of questionnaires and observation <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>practical</b> <b>experience</b> of using the methodology and simulation in teaching escalation and failure. We end the paper with the conclusion that the interactive learning approach presented in this paper has potential in rejuvenating parts of information systems education...|$|E

40|$|A {{business}} model {{can provide a}} clear framework for how a company delivers value to its customers. The better the {{business model}} is understood, the greater the ability {{for the company to}} understand how to improve its business to continually deliver greater value to it customers. Through the process of business model innovation, companies can transform their success by delivering customer value in an entirely different way. As such, understanding business model innovation is considered critical for transformational and sustained growth of a company. Business model innovation, however, is a fairly new concept and understanding how it actually occurs in practice is rare. This project offers a unique first-hand insight (i. e. autoethnography) into the process of how business model innovation occurs in a firm (Tesera Systems Inc.) {{over a long period of}} time (~ 7 years) and continues to evolve. This project shows that the actual experience of Tesera relates very well to the theories and concepts of business model innovation (i. e. framework, drivers/needs of business model innovation, typology, ontologies) and benefits (i. e. improvements in agility, resource velocity, cost structures). In addition, this project offers learning perspectives from this business model innovation experience (i. e. crisis as opportunity, value gained from understanding implicit business model innovation, the importance of a constructionist ontology, business model innovation to guide business processes externally and internally). As such, this project helps to provide value to both the theoretical and conceptual perspectives regarding business model innovation as well as those who in business are looking to better understand business model innovation <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>practical</b> <b>experience</b> to provide their firms the opportunity for transformational change and sustained success.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the manifestations of public space in restorative justice initiatives in order to reveal its impacts on the Juvenile Justice System <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>practical</b> <b>experience</b> being developed {{in the city of}} Porto Alegre. The research focused on the discussion of effectiveness of the Youth Justice System, considering the historical orientation in punitive responses to offenses, {{at the same time that}} initiatives related to a new paradigm of justice are being constituted in the national scenario. Among these initiatives is Restorative Justice, which converges to the idea of an expansion of public space, in the forms of administering justice, since this alternative to the system adds an ethical agenda, driven by the principle of human dignity of all offenders, victims and community, guided by democratic decision-making processes, carried out by the individuals directly affected by some event that caused offense individually or collectively. It is being questioned, as well, through all the chapters, the need for democratization of Justice regarding the Youth Justice, and the possible contributions of restorative justice in this process. The research uses the dialectical-critical method and is characterized as an exploratory study based on literature review and documental analysis, constituting a case study, whose unit of analysis is the Restorative Practice Central of the Youth Court of Porto Alegre. The approach of the phenomenon is qualitative, using information also quantifiable. The subjects of the study were chosen by the criterion of participation in restorative procedures in 2008. The study concludes that Restorative Youth Justice is part of the contradictory relationship between the punitive system and the orientations of ECA and SINASE, being articulated to legitimate social demands for the democratization of youth justice, with the expansion of shared social responsibility related to violence committed by youth. O estudo ora apresentado objetivou investigar as manifestações de um espaço público nas iniciativas da Justiça Restaurativa, com vistas a desvelar suas repercussões no Sistema de Justiça Juvenil, a partir da experiência concreta no município de Porto Alegre. A pesquisa debruça-se sobre a discussão da eficácia do Sistema de Justiça Juvenil, tendo em vista a histórica orientação punitiva nas respostas aos atos infracionais, ao mesmo tempo em que são constituídas, no cenário nacional, iniciativas que agregam a concepção de um novo paradigma de justiça. Dentre essas iniciativas encontra-se a Justiça Restaurativa, que converge à ideia de ampliação de um espaço público, nas formas de realização da justiça, uma vez que essa alternativa agrega ao sistema uma pauta ética, direcionada pelo princípio da dignidade humana de todos ofensores, vítimas e comunidade, orientada por processos decisórios democráticos, levados a efeito pelos sujeitos diretamente afetados por algum fato que provocou ofensa individual ou coletivamente. Questionam-se, ainda, a necessidade da democratização da Justiça, no âmbito da Justiça Juvenil e as possíveis contribuições da Justiça Restaurativa nesse processo ao longo dos capítulos. A pesquisa utiliza o método dialético-crítico e caracteriza-se por ser de natureza exploratória que se vale de levantamento bibliográfico e análise documental, constituindo-se em um estudo de caso, cuja unidade de análise é a Central de Práticas Restaurativas do Juizado da Infância e Juventude de Porto Alegre. A abordagem do objeto de estudo é qualitativa, utilizando-se também de informações quantificáveis. Os sujeitos da pesquisa foram escolhidos pelo critério de participação em procedimentos restaurativos no ano de 2008. O estudo conclui que a Justiça Juvenil Restaurativa inscreve-se contraditoriamente na relação entre o instituído sistema punitivo e ao que preconiza o ECA e o SINASE, articulando-se à legítima demanda social pela democratização da justiça juvenil, com a ampliação da responsabilidade socialmente partilhada em relação às violências praticadas pela juventude...|$|E
40|$|Critical {{reflection}} {{is increasingly}} {{regarded as a}} necessary requirement of professional practice. Yet there are many differing perspectives on what it is, and {{how it should be}} taught in professional education, and {{it is not easy to}} see how they all relate. This is often confusing for students and educators. This potentially leads to poor standards of reflection, and little rigorous research or development of critical reflection. This thesis aims to address this problem by developing an integrated understanding of critical reflection. It draws together the different perspectives on critical reflection (including reflective practice, the concept of reflexivity, postmodernism and critical perspectives), and shows how these different understandings can be integrated under the rubric of learning from experience. Although the idea of learning from experience in fact underpins early understandings of critical reflection, this thesis demonstrates how later formulations add to and develop this conception. In doing this, the thesis traces the practical and theoretical development of critical reflection into a framework which might be used as a basis for researching professional practice experience. The thesis begins with an introduction which outlines the context of my thinking about social work knowledge, in which my thinking about critical reflection is located. The body of the thesis traces how I have developed these frameworks, <b>from</b> <b>a</b> mix of <b>practical</b> <b>experience,</b> theorizing from different perspectives, and reviews of literature, into the potential for its use as a research method. The concluding section of the thesis returns to the original outline of social work knowledge, and shows how this integrated understanding of critical reflection is also congruent with basic principles of social work. In this sense, the development of thinking about critical reflection is also a contribution to the development of social work knowledge...|$|R
