In this article we consider {{the issues that are}} likely to arise as officer conduct is scrutinized more closely using state corporate fiduciary principles. The challenge is not so much one of ensuring that fiduciary principles govern the conduct of corporate actors as it is correlating obligation with potential liability. We find in this paper that ERISA is helpful in anticipating the issues that state corporate law will confront in its <b>increasing</b> focus <b>on</b> officer <b>liability.</b> We look to ERISA to identify issues expected to arise {{as a result of the}} growing state law emphasis <b>on</b> individual <b>liability</b> and to consider alternative approaches to address those issues...|$|R

40|$|Background Few studies {{examining}} the genetic architecture of cigarette smoking {{have focused on}} adolescents or examined developmental changes in additive genetic, shared environment and unique environmental influences <b>on</b> <b>liability</b> to initiate cigarette smoking and quantity of cigarettes smoked. The {{aim of this study}} is to add to the literature <b>on</b> <b>liability</b> to initiate and use cigarettes during adolescence using a nationally representative sample. Method Data for this study came from adolescent and young adult twin pairs (ages 14 - 33) from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. We ran a series of developmental causal-contingent-common pathway models to examine whether additive genetic, shared and unique environmental influences <b>on</b> <b>liability</b> to the initiation of cigarette use are shared with those on smoking quantity, and whether their contributions change across development. Results We found evidence for a developmental shift in genetic and shared environmental contributions to cigarette use. Early in adolescence genetic and environmental influences work independently <b>on</b> <b>liability</b> to cigarette smoking initiation and quantity of cigarettes smoked, but liability to these behaviors becomes correlated as individuals age into young adulthood. Conclusions These findings provide insight into the causal processes underlying the liability to smoke cigarettes. With age, there is greater overlap in the genetic and environmental factors that influence the initiation of cigarette smoking and quantity of cigarettes smoked...|$|R

As to fair value measurement <b>on</b> <b>liabilities,</b> the use of present value will be expected to facilitate decision usefulness because of improving reality on stock and avoid recognizing unrealized profit. In consideration of the characteristics of event that creates asset retirement obligations, there are conceptually two types of obligations, which are incurred upon acquisition, or any time during the operating life of an asset, either ratably of nonratably. As practical problem, however it is difficult to identify them separately. Therefore, it is necessary to management judgments. It has been seemed that fair value measurement eliminate management discretion. But, in the sense of recognition of liabilities reflected the incurrence situation, and thus, if the quality and transparency of financial reporting will be improved, it will be the space of management discretion in present value measurement as fair value...|$|R
