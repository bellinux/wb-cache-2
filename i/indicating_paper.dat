40|$|We offer a {{clarification}} {{of the significance}} of the <b>indicated</b> <b>paper</b> of H. Cheng. Cheng's conclusions about the attractive nature of Casimir forces between parallel plates are valid beyond the particular model in which he derived them; {{they are likely to be}} relevant to other recent literature on the effects of hidden dimensions on Casimir forces.

40|$|The {{statement}} of Theorem 2. 7. 6 in the <b>indicated</b> <b>paper</b> is incorrect. For instance, if m = 0 (i. e., the base field K contains no additional derivations), it {{is inconsistent with}} Theorem 2. 7. 4 due to the distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic generic radii of convergence. Theorems 2. 7. 12 and 2. 7. 13 are incorrect for similar reasons...|$|R
