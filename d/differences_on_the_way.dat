40|$|Organizations are {{affected}} by a continuous generational change in their workforce. Members of the Millennials generations started to supplant previous generations. As per any generational change the incumbent generation is supposed {{to bring to the}} workplace peculiar traits and habits which might differ from that of the previous generation, due to the differences in significant life events that the two generations crossed. Millennials are portrayed as digital natives, i. e. individuals deeply immersed in information and communication technologies, used to intensively interact with them for a wide gamut of purposes, and dependent on them so much that when they are taken away from their devices they start to feel a sense of lack and inadequateness. The literature has studied digital natives mainly from the perspective of teaching and education. Few woks focused instead on the collaboration consequences raised by the presence of these individuals in the workforce. This paper {{is part of a larger}} research project devoted to study if the intense interaction that digital natives had with information and communications technologies produced consequences in their behaviour in professional contexts.

40|$|The way {{to ask for}} {{permission}} from others {{is one of the}} speech acts that has some unique aspects to be investigated, It is because the expression of asking {{for permission}} is differently expressed by different people in different situations. Different gender between the interlocutors may influence the way one asks for permission because men and women are different in using language. The way people ask for permission, to a greater extent, is affected by the situation in which the asking permission is expressed Different cultural background of the speakers may be responsible for producing different ways of asking for permission because each ethnic has different opinion about what politeness is. Therefore, I would like to know whether there might be some similarities and differences between the expressions of asking for permission produced by the Chinese students and the ones produced by the Javanese students. This study investigates the utterances expressed by the Chinese and Javanese students of SMU Krisyen Petra 3 in asking for permission to find out the similarities and / or <b>differences</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> they ask for permission for taking leave. To determine which language function reveals mostly, at first I as the main instrument list the data collected from 12 respondents (3 Chinese female, 3 Chinese male, 3 Javanese female, and 3 Javanese,male) through the questionnaire. Then, those utterances classified into tables by following Van Ek`s (1976) classification of the language functions in order to know what the speaker actually intends to say / to do. reveals in the asking for permission expressions is Having analyzed the data, I find out that the predominant function that seeking permission. Then, it is followed by apologizing function that is used to show that they are in the lower position and reporting function that is used to convince the authority. Next, {{it can be seen that}} there is only a slight difference among the frequency number of language functions in terms of respondents? ethic and gender difference. In a similar way, in terms of addressees? ethnic difference, there is only a slight difference, too. On the contrary, based on the addressees? gender difference, there is a big difference between the frequency number of language function reveal in the permission utterances, as well as in terms of addressees? social status difference and situation difference. Finally, it can be concluded that in order to make a polite permission that make it is granted by the authority, the addressers should pay attention to the use of certain language functions. There are 4 language functions that never occur in the permission utterances expressed to the teacher as the superior, they are suggesting a course of action, requesting others to do something, advising others to do something, and instructing/ directing others to do something. In this way, by understanding the use of language function, it is possible to create a permission which will not be assumed as sarcasm, joking, or even rudeness...|$|E

50|$|The {{rebirth of}} the idea of an {{architect}} in the Renaissance radically changed the nature of building design. The Renaissance reintroduced the classical style of architecture. Leon Battista Alberti's treatise <b>on</b> architecture raised <b>the</b> subject to a new level, defining architecture as something worthy of study by the aristocracy. Previously it was viewed merely as a technical art, suited only to the artisan. The resulting change in status of architecture and more importantly the architect is key to understanding the changes in the process of design. The Renaissance architect was often an artist (a painter or sculptor) who had little knowledge of building technology but a keen grasp of the rules of classical design. The architect thus had to provide detailed drawings for the craftsmen setting out the disposition of the various parts. This was what is called the process of design, from the Italian word for drawing. Occasionally the architect would get involved in particularly difficult technical problems but the technical side of architecture was mainly left up to the craftsmen. This change in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> buildings were designed had a fundamental <b>difference</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> problems were approached. Where the Medieval craftsmen tended to approach a problem with a technical solution in mind, the Renaissance architects started with an idea of what the end product needed to look like and then searched around for a way of making it work. This led to extraordinary leaps forward in engineering.|$|R

40|$|At first sight, Brazil and France seem pretty {{distant from}} one another, {{but on the}} map, they are not {{separated}} by the Atlantic Ocean, but by the Oyapock River, located between the state of Amapa and French Guiana (French overseas department), creating a 730 km long international border. If the distance does exist, it is very different when we finely analyze some similarities {{in the field of}} biomedical research. France is the biggest country of Western Europe and covers 1 / 5 of the European Union. Apart from Metropolitan France, the country contains overseas territories, remnants of its colonial past. Over the centuries, France has known several political systems, from Ancient History to the current Republic. According to Ernest Renan, the French nation is more an ideology than a reality, primarily based on “the desire of living together and the wish to highlight our legacy”(1). The tragic attacks of November 2015 and all the reactions over the next days illustrate this. Brazil, discovered by the Portuguese explorer Pedro Alvares during the 16 th century, is established on half of South America and is about 16 times bigger than France. This giant does not look to the past but is always moving forward. The concept of nation is really strong throughout the country, as shown by the enthusiasm of soccer players wearing the national auriverde jersey and the National Team supporters. Furthermore, they possess a strong culture of entrepreneurship defined by Stefan Zweig as the legacy of the early colonial era(2). Biomedical research is a human activity which aims to give expected solutions, and sometimes unexpected ones too, to a major and insoluble problem at a given time. This research is based on knowledge and will question it with a scientific approach, spread between what is known today and what will be known tomorrow. Ideally, the point of getting new knowledge is to improve a group of people or the entire population’s health. The researcher is a creator of knowledge but is also a pioneer, what imposes an ethical responsibility. For the last 20 years, the way how biomedical research is led has changed with the definition of “good clinical practice”. The globalization of the biomedical research is {{explained by the fact that}} we have made many improvements so far but we always need more and more patients to prove the superiority of a treatment to another. Many patents about “blockbusters treatments” expire soon, so the pharmaceutical industry speeds up to discover new ones to replace them, which explains the multiplication of clinical trials. The pharmaceutical industry and the emerging markets share common interests, which lead them to work together, increasing the phenomenon of globalization. The good clinical practice refers to standards shared by Europe, North America, Japan and Australia, about international ethical and scientific quality defining the conception, the conduct, the registration and the presentation of data during trials involving human beings. Emerging markets are not obliged to follow these standards, what implies that part of the modalities can be dissimulated. The International Conference on Harmonisation(3) has elaborated recommendations related to the research and the development of new medications which clearly aim to limit human, animal and material resources to decrease the time for the trials. The Brazilian health law respects these international standards and is the most advanced in Latin America along with the Argentinian and Mexican systems. In addition, many Brazilian doctors have studied overseas and respect these rules. However, if consensuses on theoretical notions about bioethics exist, there are still <b>differences</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> research policies are applied. If respecting all international standards about ethics (Declaration of Helsinki 1964, Belmont Report 1978, International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects and the Resolution of the National Health Council CNS 196 / 96) is required by every Brazilian scientific review and the National Commission for Ethics in Research, it is surprising that this resolution, which aimed to protect the patients, the institutions and the country, has been recently (12 / 12 / 12) dismissed(4). It is easy to acknowledge a whole scientific community of a country a dignity of principle, but it is harder to define the modalities of its implementation on the border of life (birth and death) when these nations have fundamental cultural, economical, historical and societal differences. The following examples illustrate the various ethical challenges. Geopolitics Brazil has many advantages favoring the development of biomedical research on its territory. Its situation in the Southern hemisphere with inverted seasons compared to Europe allows trials all along the year. Its proximity with the US and Canadian pharmaceutical companies, compared to Asia, is more convenient for logistics. The incidence of many diseases is pretty similar to Europe and North America with a high incidence of cardiovascular diseases (42...|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{a growing}} number of studies have {{investigated}} the cues used by children to selectively accept testimony. In parallel, several studies with adults have shown that the fluency with which information is provided influences message evaluation: adults evaluate fluent information as more credible than dysfluent information. It is therefore plausible that the fluency of a message could also influence children’s endorsement of statements. Two experiments were designed to test this hypothesis with 3 to 5 -year-olds where the auditory fluency of a message was manipulated by adding different levels of noise to recorded statements. The results show that 4 and 5 -year-old children, but not 3 -year-olds, are more likely to endorse a fluent statement than a dysfluent one.

In this paper, it is proven that GLP is capable of compensating the aliasing of MS, unlike ATW, and analogously to component substitution (CS) fusion methods, thanks to the decimation and interpolation stages present in its flowchart. Experimental results will be presented in terms of quality/distortion global score indexes (SAM, ERGAS and Q 4) for increasing amounts of aliasing, measured by the amplitude at Nyquist frequency of the Gaussian-like lowpass filter simulating the average MTF of the individual spectral channels of the instrument.

They say that coincident entities may {{differ in their}} persistence conditions and in the sortals they fall under. But how can they differ in these ways, given that they share all their microphysical properties? What grounds those differences, if not their microphysical properties? Do those <b>differences</b> depend only <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> we conceptualise those objects? Are they primitive facts about reality? Neither option is pleasant for the pluralist, but what else can she say? To respond to the grounding problem, the pluralist should first tell a story about what material objects are. If that story explains how the modal and sortal properties of objects are grounded, {{in a way that}} allows for differences between coincident objects, then she has a response to the problem. That is precisely my aim in this paper...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{comparative}} study of the heroines' efforts to have self-fulfilment in life through job and love in two different novels, Villette and Namaku Hiroko. It examines the background or conditions of each heroine which lead them to have the idea of self-fulfilment and their struggle to have self-fulfilment. Since there are two heroines, {{it is assumed that}} there are some similarities and dissimilarities between both of them. To show those similarities and dissimilarities, a literary approach, by using conflict and characterization, is applied. Besides, library reaserch is also conducted to collect criticisms and books. The first similarity between both heroines, Lucy Snowe and Hiroko, is that they face hard conditions or surroundings which lead them to have the idea of self-fulfilment. The idea of self-fulfilment, as a matter of fact, reveals that both of them are encouraged to have a job and a "heterosexual love". The second similarity is that both of them have to encounter many conflicts in their job and love. Yet, their struggles to have self-fulfilment through their job and love are not exactly <b>the</b> same <b>way.</b> Lucy's struggle to become a teacher is not as complex as Hiroko's struggle to achieve a steady job. Another <b>difference</b> is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> heroines gain a heterosexual love. However, both heroines' strong-determination enable them to solve all the conflicts they encounter. As a result, they are able to have self-fulfilment through their job and love. Nevertheless, the roles of the opposite sex's love, Paul's love to Lucy and Yoshida's love to Hiroko, also contribute to their self-fulfilment...|$|R
40|$|Many {{real-world}} optimization {{problems are}} subject to dynamic environments that require an optimization algorithm to track the optimum during changes. Ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithms {{have proved to be}} powerful methods to address combinatorial dynamic optimization problems (DOPs), once they are enhanced properly. The integration of ACO algorithms with immigrants schemes showed promising performance <b>on</b> different DOPs. <b>The</b> principle of immigrants schemes is to introduce new solutions (called immigrants) and replace a small portion in the current population. In this paper, immigrants schemes are specifically designed for the dynamic vehicle routing problem (DVRP). Three immigrants schemes are investigated: random, elitism- and memory-based. Their <b>difference</b> relies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> immigrants are generated, e. g., in random immigrants they are generated randomly whereas in elitism- and memory-based the best solution from previous environments is retrieved as the base to generate immigrants. Random immigrants aim to maintain the population diversity in order to avoid premature convergence. Elitism- and memory-based immigrants aim to maintain the population diversity and transfer knowledge from previous environments, simultaneously, to enhance the adaptation capabilities. The experiments are based on a series of systematically constructed DVRP test cases, generated from a general dynamic benchmark generator, to compare and benchmark the proposed ACO algorithms integrated with immigrants schemes with other peer ACO algorithms. Sensitivity analysis regarding some key parameters of the proposed algorithms is also carried out. The experimental results show that the performance of ACO algorithms depends <b>on</b> <b>the</b> properties of DVRPs and that immigrants schemes improve the performance of ACO in tackling DVRPs...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{recognize}} familiar faces across different viewing conditions contrasts with the inherent difficulty {{in the perception of}} unfamiliar faces across similar image manipulations. It is widely believed that this difference in perception and recognition is based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> neural representation for familiar faces being less sensitive to changes in the image than it is for unfamiliar faces. Here, we used an functional magnetic resonance-adaptation paradigm to investigate image invariance in face-selective regions of the human brain. We found clear evidence for a degree of image-invariant adaptation to facial identity in face-selective regions, such as the fusiform face area. However, contrary to the predictions of models of face processing, comparable levels of image invariance were evident for both familiar and unfamiliar faces. This suggests that the marked differences in the perception of familiar and unfamiliar faces may not depend <b>on</b> <b>differences</b> in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> multiple images are represented in core face-selective regions of the human brain...|$|R
40|$|This {{article focuses}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{relevance}} {{and consequences of}} visibility of religious identity respectively difference by means of religiously connoted clothing. Based on six case studies it emphasizes the perspective of wearers of religious vestment {{in the area of}} Zürich (Switzerland). The project takes account of the fact, that the aspect of visual, respectively embodied (religious) difference is not only of relevance to Muslim headscarf wearers (though, due to eager public discussion, it became here the most obvious, and the main subject of scientific interest), but also for wearers of religious clothing belonging to other religious communities. Regarding the case studies the present article will mainly focus on three aspects of religious clothing: firstly, it will address one important motive (among others) for wearing religious dress. Secondly, the individual perceptions of visual <b>difference</b> based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> specific <b>way</b> of sartorial self-presentation will be thematised — especially regarding their involvement with their social environment. Finally, various individual strategies for coping with tensions based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> experience of visual difference will be demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|Based {{on our own}} values, {{developed}} {{either by}} nature or nurture or by both, the work presented here takes as its premise the notion that positive benefits can accrue from international and cross-cultural experiences (1). We formally acknowledge our bias in favour of internationalisation as a 21 st century imperative for institutions of HE (2). In common with other public service providers, universities suffer constrained autonomy, disputed values and aims, and increasing performance demands (3). ‘New managerialism’ {{in the public sector}} is a term referring to “ideologies” and the “actual use”(4) of private sector practice, technology and values. However, values of internationalism and the ideals of international co-operation, aim for a world order of peace and social justice. Connecting three apparently disparate areas are the assertions that values, attitudes and ethics, clustered by some under ‘culture’, are prominent not only in comprehensive internationalisation strategy but also in entrepreneurial and innovative behaviour (5). The effect of values and beliefs on university decision making is strong (6). Sporn defined the ‘strength’ of a university culture as the degree of fit between values, structure and strategy (7). Bartell requires that internationalisation utilises the power of the culture within which it occurs (6). Knight (8) suggests that improved intercultural understanding in graduates, is regarded as a strong and legitimate motive for internationalisation by many academics. Simons (9) names the first of his four ‘levers of control’ ‘beliefs systems’ which are the values, mission and credos of the organisation. Peters & Waterman (10) explain that better-performing companies have a well-defined articulation of values and also the content of those values, which makes the difference. It can be argued that the ‘clearly competing agendas’ (11) of globalisation (marketisation) and internationalisation (values) could be reconciled by the fact that internationally-minded students, high quality staff and desirable institutional partners will be attracted only by ‘truly’ internationalised organisations that have followed the holistic, comprehensive route. Instead, the rise of managerialism has pushed universities into trying to adopt a planned approach to internationalisation, working entirely against the predominant values of academics. Schumpeter’s defnition of “pure” entrepreneurship (12) : “the doing of new things or the doing of things that are already done in a new way” emphasises the value of autonomy and flexibility, similar to ‘academic freedom’ and therefore appealing to the strong values of many university staff. Management is increasingly a cultural rather than technical activity (13). This article describes an experiment in the UK to establish a “campus community” (14). It is an idea for multicultural campuses to develop spaces for the ‘non-mobile majority’ to experience <b>difference</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to global citizenship. Here we reflect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> experience, in which outcomes are affected by the depth of student engagement, which is in turn related to fundamental motivations for and attitudes towards learning, employment and internationalism: the students’ values. The “campus community” developed into a full structure of “communities of practice” or social collaborations, often digitally-based, and peer-support, which drove increasing levels of engagement in international activity by students. Highly-engaged students and staff shared values and spread them more widely through a network of communication, transforming the experience of others. Thematic analysis of this initiative leads us to identify different forms of motivation, levels of engagement and entrepreneurial behaviour in both students and staff, combining to define a set of values and behaviours driving a social collaboration’s culture and performance...|$|R
