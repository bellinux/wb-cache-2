40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{the effect of}} {{isothermal}} forging process parameters on the microstructure and the mechanical properties of TA 15 titanium alloy was researched. The results of the tests indicate that, {{in the range of}} temperature of 850 ºC~ 980 ºC and deformation degree of 20 %~ 60 %, with the increase of temperature or deformation, as the reinforcement of deformation recrystallization, the primary α-phase tends to the spherical shape and secondary α-phase transforms from the acicular shape to fine and spherical shape with disperse distribution, which enhance the tensile properties at room and high temperature. With the increment of <b>forging</b> <b>times,</b> the spheroidization of primary α-phase aggrandizes and secondary α-phase transforms from spherical and acicular shape to wide strip shape, which decrease the tensile properties at room and high temperature. The preferable isothermal forging process parameters are temperature of 980 ºC, deformation degree of 60 %, and few <b>forging</b> <b>times...</b>|$|R

5000|$|In {{the first}} round, the four smiths are {{presented}} with a starting material that they must use to forge a blade. In some episodes, they all begin with the same material; in others, they may choose from an assortment of metal objects or must salvage their material from a source such as a junked car or lawnmower. Willis states one set of criteria concerning blade or blade/tang length, and often a second set for a feature that must be incorporated, such as serrations or a fuller groove; not all competitions require a special feature. The smiths are typically given 10 minutes to sketch out their designs, but this time is occasionally extended or omitted altogether. Following the design period, they are given a set length of <b>time</b> to <b>forge</b> their blades. The <b>forging</b> <b>time</b> is three hours in most episodes, but may be extended to four hours if the extra feature poses a sufficient challenge, such as being required to forge a billet with modern damascus steel methods and use it for the blade. Once time expires, the judges evaluate the blades based on Willis' criteria and inspect their workmanship, quality, and design.|$|R

40|$|Abstract ─ In this paper, {{we present}} Forge, an optimal {{algorithm}} for gate sizing using the Elmore delay model. The algorithm utilizes Lagrangian relaxation with a fast gradient-based pre-processing step that provides an effective set of initial Lagrange multipliers. Com-pared {{to the previous}} Lagrangian-based approach, Forge is consid-erably faster and {{does not have the}} inefficiencies due to difficult-to-determine initial conditions and constant factors. We compared the two algorithms on 30 benchmark designs, on a Sun UltraSparc- 60 workstation. On average <b>Forge</b> is 200 <b>times</b> faster than the previ-ously published algorithm. We then improved Forge by incorporating a slew-rate-based convex delay model, which handles distinct rise and fall gate delays. We show that <b>Forge</b> is 15 <b>times</b> faster, on aver-age, than the AMPS transistor-sizing tool from Synopsys, while achieving the same delay targets and using similar total transistor area. ...|$|R

A thread of publications progressively reduced the size of m for which affine signatures can be <b>forged</b> in polynomial <b>time.</b> The current bound is log m ∼ 1 3 log N where N is the public rsa modulus. In this paper we consider a slightly different problem: instead of minimizing m’s size we try to minimize its entropy. We show that affine signatures on 1 log N 4 entropy-bit messages can be <b>forged</b> in polynomial <b>time.</b> This problem has no specific cryptographic impact but allows to better understand how malleable the rsa function is. We also exhibit a second sub-exponential time technique (faster than factoring) for creating affine modular relations between integers containing three messages of log N. size...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{the high}} level of {{investment}} needed in countries such as e. g. Europe and Asia, there is an increasing demand for machines for the manufacture of rails, railway wheels and railway axles. At the moment railway axles are in most cases forged in a series of different forming processes. In an initial rolling process for example possible defects in the starting material are closed {{in order to get a}} homogenous microstructure. In a subsequent forging process, due to the low depth penetration capacity of the plants used, only the contouring of the axle is carried out. The SMS Meer presentation shows that using the SMX hydraulic radial forging machine from SMS Meer it is possible to produce railway axles in a single forming process. This means that pore-free railway axles with an excellent microstructure can be produced from conventional continuous cast material without any upstream rolling process being required. Using the hydraulic radial forging machine, continuous cast carbon steel with defects running in an axial direction can be forged into a railway twin axle in only one heat. The high forming potential of the hydraulic radial forging machine makes this possible. The analyses with regard to microstructure, grain size and pore detection will show very good results. In the zone with the least degree of forming, a homogeneous microstructure evenly distributed across the radius was achieved. The average grain size of 8. 5 (ASTM) is likewise evenly distributed across the radius. An ultrasonic analysis of the forged axles showed that there are no pores larger than 3 mm. As these results are very promising, the <b>forging</b> <b>time</b> will be optimized in subsequent tests and the forged axles will be finish machined for a final analysis in accordance with the railway standard...|$|R
