It is also steamed individually. It is also used in combination with meat dishes such as “Sliced Pork Stir Fried with Lettuce.” Lettuce soups are also common, along with fish or minced chicken. For this preparation, fresh and crisp lettuce is chosen and the soup is consumed hot and not allowed to go tasteless. Other varieties of dishes are “Lettuce and fermented Bean Cake” and “Clear Simmered Bean Card with Lettuce and Cellophane Noodles.” Stem lettuce, which originated in China, is cooked and used as a food item.|$|E
50|$|The locative marker (-nge ~ -e ~ -Vː) {{appears on}} the locative {{complement}} of a verb <b>in</b> <b>plain</b> <b>form.</b> The objective case serves this purpose with negative verbs. Locative case is formed by lengthening the final vowel in instances of vowel-final base forms such as barnga ‘stone’ (LOC barngaa). While the Locative case can denote a variety of locative relations (such as those expressed in English by at, on, in, along, etc.), such relations may be specified using inherently locative nominals (e.g. minda ‘near’, nyirriri ‘under’) that do not themselves inflect for this case. Nominals corresponding to animate beings tend not to be marked with Locative case; Genitive is preferred for such constructions as yarramangan ‘on the horse’ (lit. ‘of the horse’). On pronouns, for which case-marking is irregular, Locative case is realized via ‘double-expression’ of Genitive case: ngada ‘I’ > ngithun ‘I(gen) = my’ > ngithunngan ‘I(gen)+gen = on me’.|$|E

In both studies, the system is limited to using eigen-face recognition algorithm with homomorphic encryption when there are better alternative face recognition algorithms. Moreover, they do not use a threshold cryptosystem, which prevents a malicious party from aiming to perform decryption by himself.

These assumptions are actually quite questionable and require careful attention. In this paper, we aim at providing solid statistical analysis methods to analyze the measurement data on testing chips and extract the statistical distribution, either Gaussian or non-Gaussian {{which could be used}} in advanced SSTA algorithms for confidence interval or error bound information. Two contributions are achieved by this paper. First, we develop a moment matching based quadratic function modeling method to fit the first three moments of given measurement data <b>in</b> <b>plain</b> <b>form</b> which may not follow Gaussian distributions. Second, we provide a systematic way to analyze the confident intervals on our modeling strategies. The confidence intervals analysis gives the solid guidelines for testing chip data collections.

The weight of gold in both cases was in the range 40 – 55 % of the full target weight (atomic percentage of about 22 %). Experiments were performed with the single beam of the Prague Asterix Laser System (PALS) at 0. 43 μm wavelength (3 ω of the fundamental wavelength), 120 Joule energy and 300 psec pulse duration.

40|$|Abstract. Rank {{and select}} queries on bitmaps are {{fundamental}} {{for the construction}} of a variety of compact data structures. Both can, in theory, be answered in constant time by spending o(n) extra bits on top of the original bitmap, of length n, or of a compressed version of it. However, while the solution for rank is indeed simple and practical, a similar result for select has been elusive, and practical compact data structure implementations avoid its use whenever possible. In addition, the overhead of the o(n) extra bits is in many cases very significant. In this paper we bridge the gap between theory and practice by presenting two structures, one using the bitmap <b>in</b> <b>plain</b> <b>form</b> and another using a compressed form, that are simple to implement and combine much lower space overheads than previous work with excellent time performance for rank and select queries. In particular, our structure for plain bitmaps is far smaller and faster for select than any previous structure, while competitive for rank with the best previous structures of similar size. ...|$|E
40|$|Bringer et al. {{proposed}} two cryptographic protocols for the computation of Hamming distance. Their first scheme uses Oblivious Transfer {{and provides}} {{security in the}} semi-honest model. The other scheme uses Committed Oblivious Transfer and is claimed to provide full security in the malicious case. The proposed protocols have direct implications to biometric authentication schemes between a prover and a verifier where the verifier has biometric data of the users <b>in</b> <b>plain</b> <b>form.</b> In this paper, we show that their protocol is not actually fully secure against malicious adversaries. More precisely, our attack breaks the soundness property of their protocol where a malicious user can compute a Hamming distance which {{is different from the}} actual value. For biometric authentication systems, this attack allows a malicious adversary to pass the authentication without knowledge of the honest user’s input with at most O(n) complexity instead of O(2 n), where n is the input length. We propose an enhanced version of their protocol where this attack is eliminated. The security of our modified protocol is proven using the simulation-based paradigm. Furthermore, as for efficiency concerns, the modified protocol utilizes Verifiable Oblivious Transfer which does not require the commitments to outputs which improves its efficiency significantly...|$|E
30|$|A direct {{solution}} to biometric template protection {{might be to}} store biometric templates on the server side <b>in</b> <b>plain</b> <b>form,</b> and, in this way, it {{may seem to be}} possible to realize biometric authentication by simply utilizing well-known authentication protocols like SSL/TLS. However, as far as security and privacy are concerned, one of the major security issues in this scenario is that any malicious behavior on server side can be very harmful because of storage of biometric data in clear. Furthermore, these standard authentication protocols use conventional cryptographic primitives like Hash, RSA, and AES that cannot be directly used since encryptions cannot be decrypted by the server alone and also biometric data are inherently noisy [9]. More precisely, when a malicious database manager obtains decryption keys, she can perform decryption alone and can access biometric templates of all users. Therefore, biometric templates should be encrypted during the enrollment phase where the private key and encryption are never given to the server and authentication should be still guaranteed. Namely, when a biometric template is encrypted during the enrollment stage, only an approximate comparison between the stored and measured biometric data should be decrypted during the authentication stage. With the conventional cryptographic mechanisms, however, this again can lead to security and privacy issues for biometric templates at the authentication stage [9].|$|E

30|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a new biometric verification and template protection system which we call THRIVE. The system includes novel enrollment and authentication protocols based on threshold homomorphic encryption where a private key is shared between a user and a verifier. In the THRIVE system, only encrypted binary biometric templates are stored in a database and verification is performed via homomorphically randomized templates, thus, original templates are never revealed during authentication. Due to the underlying threshold homomorphic encryption scheme, a malicious database owner cannot perform full decryption on encrypted templates of the users in the database. In addition, security of the THRIVE system is enhanced using a two-factor authentication scheme involving user’s private key and biometric data. Using simulation-based techniques, the proposed system is proven secure in the malicious model. The proposed system is suitable for applications where the user {{does not want to}} reveal her biometrics to the verifier <b>in</b> <b>plain</b> <b>form,</b> but needs to prove her identity by using biometrics. The system can be used with any biometric modality where a feature extraction method yields a fixed size binary template and a query template is verified when its Hamming distance to the database template is less than a threshold. The overall connection time for the proposed THRIVE system is estimated to be 336 ms on average for 256 -bit biometric templates on a desktop PC running with quad core 3.2 GHz CPUs at 10 Mbit/s up/down link connection speed. Consequently, the proposed system can be efficiently used in real-life applications.|$|E

30|$|Against fuzzy vaults [16], several {{attacks have}} been discovered. Chang et al. [198] present an {{observation}} to distinguish minutiae from chaff points attacking fuzzy vaults based on fingerprints. Since chaff points are created one-by-one, those created later tend reveal smaller empty surrounding areas which is verified experimentally, i.e., {{the security of}} a fuzzy vault highly relies on the methodology of generating chaff points. Scheirer and Boult [190] introduce an attack via record multiplicity. If more instances of a fuzzy vault (generated using different keys) are obtained minutiae are likely recoverable, i.e., unlinkability represents a major issue constructing fuzzy vaults. A method for inserting chaff points with a minimal entropy loss has been proposed in [133]. A brute force attack against fuzzy vaults was proposed in [199]. A collusion attack where the attacker is assumed to be in possession of multiple vaults locked by the same key is presented in [200]. It is demonstrated how to effectively identify chaff points which are subsequently remove to unlock the vault. In [201], vulnerabilities within the concept of a hardened fuzzy vaults are pointed out. In contrast to other concepts (e.g., the fuzzy commitment scheme) the fuzzy vault scheme does not obscure the original biometric template but hides it by adding chaff points, i.e., helper data comprise original biometric features (e.g., minutiae) <b>in</b> <b>plain</b> <b>form.</b> Even if practical key retrieval rates are provided by proposed systems, impostors may still be able to unlock vaults in case the helper data does not hide the original biometric template properly, especially if attackers are in possession of several instances of a single vault.|$|E
