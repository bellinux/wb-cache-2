Crittenden also made her debut as a writer for The Simpsons in this episode. Crittenden was taking a beginners' writing program at 20th Century Fox when former The Simpsons showrunner David Mirkin hired her on the show. Crittenden's only writing experience before that had been as an intern on the Late Show with David Letterman. 20th Century Fox introduced Crittenden to Mirkin, and Mirkin read a script of hers that he liked. When Mirkin first talked to Crittenden, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> was a really nice woman who was very mature.

25|$|Six months later, when Genie was 20 months old, her {{paternal}} grandmother {{died in a}} hit-and-run traffic accident. Her death affected Genie's father far beyond normal levels of grief, and because his son had been walking with her he held his son responsible, further heightening his anger. When the truck's driver received only a probationary sentence for both manslaughter and drunk driving, he became delusional with rage. Scientists believed these events made him feel society had failed him and convinced him {{he would need to}} protect his family from the outside world, and that in doing so he lacked the self-awareness to recognize the destruction his actions caused. Because Genie's father believed Genie was severely mentally retarded <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> needed additional protection from society, and therefore decided he needed to entirely hide her existence. He immediately quit his job and moved his family into his mother's two-bedroom house, where he insisted on leaving his mother's car and bedroom completely untouched as shrines to her, and further increased the family's isolation.|$|E

500|$|Charlene's first {{scenes were}} with Scott Robinson (played by Jason Donovan). <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> {{was trying to}} break into the Ramsay house and confronted her, which {{resulted}} in Charlene punching him. Minogue ended up punching Donovan for real during the take. Producers soon created a story arc for the characters that saw them enter into a romantic relationship. Scott and Charlene's relationship helped boost ratings for Neighbours and the show's publicist, Brian Walsh, capitalised on Minogue and Donovan's increasing popularity with viewers and rumoured off-screen romance. Of Scott and Charlene, Minogue commented [...] "People like Scott and Charlene being a couple. It's probably the most normal relationship in the show." [...] Kelly Bourne from TV Week observed that Scott and Charlene struck a chord with fans, who could identify with them.|$|E

500|$|When {{the episode}} was in production, Oakley's wife Rachel Pulido was an {{enthusiastic}} Barbie collector. Oakley therefore {{spent a lot}} of time going to Barbie conventions across the United States and met many different collectors. At one convention, Oakley met the man who owned the world's largest Barbie collection. The meeting between the two inspired the part of the episode where Lisa visits Smithers and it is revealed that Smithers is the owner of the world's largest Malibu Stacy collection. Kathleen Turner guest starred in the episode as Stacy Lovell. Mirkin thought Turner was [...] "completely game" [...] when she showed up at the recording studio to record her lines as she [...] "nailed" [...] her lines really fast. He added that he enjoyed directing her and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> had one of the best performances ever on The Simpsons.|$|E
500|$|In {{her first}} appearance, Laura San Giacomo plays Harmony Chase, {{a woman who}} hires Keith to {{investigate}} her cheating husband. The two were both series regulars on the NBC sitcom Just Shoot Me!. The two actors had maintained a close friendship after their sitcom was cancelled, and when Rob Thomas brought up a romantic storyline for Keith to Colantoni, he suggested Giacomo for the role. Giacomo accepted the role, later stating, [...] "It {{was kind of a}} no-brainer situation for me. I love Rico, love working with him, and it was just as much fun as I thought it would be." [...] In addition to sharing in-jokes about Just Shoot Me! while on set, Colantoni also remembered what a good actress <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> was in their earlier days. After the first appearance, both Colantoni and Giacomo lobbied for more storylines together. Thomas was open to the possibility, saying, [...] "I wouldn't hesitate to go back to this, because I was really happy with how it played out." [...] Giacomo would go on to appear on three episodes of the show.|$|E
500|$|... "Wake Up Dead" [...] {{features}} lyrics which {{describe a}} man who has been cheating on his wife or girlfriend and is sneaking into his house, knowing that if his wife finds out about his other lover, she will kill him. Mustaine said that [...] "Wake up Dead" [...] was written about him cheating on a girl with whom he was living. He stayed with her because he was homeless at the time and needed a place to stay. Unfortunately, {{he was in love with}} another girl and thought the one he lived with would be mad because he was cheating on her. He had to leave her because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> had intentions to kill him. [...] "The Conjuring", according to author Bob Larson, simulates a Satanic ceremony, and makes references about being the devil's advocate and his salesman. Mustaine explained the song is about black magic and contains instructions for hexes. However, because the subject matter appears incompatible to his conversion to Christianity, the song has not been played live since 2001.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, Larsson stated that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> might be {{looked upon as}} {{somewhat}} of an unusual kind of sociopath, due to her traumatic life experiences and inability to conform to social norms.|$|R

500|$|Nora Brown (widow of James H. Brown, first {{assistant}} director on The Birds and Marnie, who knew Hitchcock for several years) {{said that her}} husband would not have endorsed The Girls interpretation of events and the film's portrayal of Hitchcock would have saddened him. Gwyneth Hughes interviewed James Brown {{as part of her}} background research for the film, but he died before the film was completed. In October 2012, Nora Brown told The Daily Telegraph that she had written to Hughes expressing her anger. Hughes has said that James H. Brown backed up Hedren's claims of sexual harassment. Tony Lee Moral, author of two books about the making of the Hitchcock films in which Hedren starred, echoed Brown's comments. Writing for Broadcast in December 2012, Moral (who interviewed Jim Brown at length for his 2013 book, The Making of Hitchcock's The Birds) recalled a remark Brown made about Hitchcock. [...] "Some {{of the things that are}} expressed about [...] are highly over exaggerated. I think Hitch became upset because he thought Tippi wasn't fulfilling the star quality that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> had or was looking for." ...|$|E
500|$|After dismissing Anthony Julius, a Mishcon de Reya lawyer, Mills stated {{she would}} {{represent}} {{herself in the}} upcoming divorce hearing, with help from her sister Fiona, David Rosen, a solicitor-advocate, and Michael Shilub, an American attorney. In leaked documents, Mills complained that McCartney was often drunk, smoked cannabis, stabbed her with a broken wine glass, pushed her over a table, and pushed her into a bathtub when she was pregnant. Referring to her part in the marriage, Mills {{said that she had}} been a full-time wife, mother, lover, confidante, business partner and psychologist to McCartney. McCartney's lawyers studied Mills's book: Life Balance: The Essential Keys to a Lifetime of Wellbeing (2006), as it contradicted many of her claims, such as when she praised McCartney for [...] "Bringing me breakfast in bed every morning, no matter how he feels, and I do the dinner, so we've got that agreement. It's thoughtfulness". Mills's father reconciled with his daughter after meeting her and McCartney, when they introduced him to his granddaughter, Beatrice. After their separation, he said that it [...] "took guts to represent yourself at the High Court", and that he was proud of his daughter, even though <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> would be [...] "torn to shreds" [...] by McCartney's lawyers.|$|E
500|$|On their seventy-second {{day on the}} island, Nikki and Paulo join Locke when he ventures back to the Pearl Station, {{hoping to}} {{communicate}} with the Others. Paulo returns to the toilet to retrieve the diamonds, storing them in his underwear thereafter. As they leave, the group witnesses Mr. Eko's death and burial not far from The Pearl. Eighty-one days after the crash, Nikki finds out about Paulo hiding the diamonds from her. Furious, she releases a venomous spider on him that causes Paulo to be paralyzed for the next eight hours. As he is entering the state of paralysis, Paulo admits he only kept the diamonds from her because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> would leave him after she got them. To Nikki's dismay, the death of the venomous spider only attracted more spiders which bite Nikki, so she is also temporarily paralyzed. The pair are mistaken for dead after being discovered by the survivors. Nikki and Paulo are then buried alive by James [...] "Sawyer" [...] Ford and Hugo [...] "Hurley" [...] Reyes after tossing the diamonds in the grave with them as they consider them to be of no value on the island. Much later, Miles Straume − a psychic who can read people's thoughts from their time of death − indicates he knows about the diamonds.|$|E
