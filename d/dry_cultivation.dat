5000|$|Agriculture in Bidar {{had its own}} {{specific}} form. Drawing on the {{specification of}} the local ecology, agriculture was mostly <b>dry</b> <b>cultivation</b> or rain-dependent cultivation in which {{a wide variety of}} local sorghum (jola, the staple grain) was grown in combination with pulses, oil seeds, wheat and other cereals. Though cultivation was restricted to two periods, rabi or [...] "winter cultivation" [...] (August-January), and kharif or [...] "summer cultivation" [...] (June-September), care was taken to cultivate green manure crops of sannhemp and diancha. The cultivation and use of such manure crops helped agriculturists retain the fertility of the soil, decreased the chances of external pests and diseases entering the fields, and enabled agriculturists to be self-reliant for a very significant agricultural input.

40|$|Due to the {{changing}} climatic and environmental conditions, modifications in agricultural and water policies have been made, and irrigated agriculture has to {{face the challenge of}} making a rational and optimal use of the water resource effectively available. This urges rice farming, strongly and traditionally linked to water, to change the modalities {{for the use of the}} resource. If on one hand water saving techniques should be preferred, a different water management in paddy fields may lead to lower yields and higher production costs, with consequent repercussions on farm incomes. The paper recognizes the disagreement between environmental and economic concerns and aims at contributing to the discussion about how to reconcile them by adopting alternative irrigation strategies. From this perspective, a multi-objective linear optimization model is used to explore the trade-offs between conflicting objectives in a rice-growing area in Northern Italy. The model returns the optimal allocation of land subject to three different irrigation strategies, as those previously performed in experimental fields; in addition, a scenario analysis is run to simulate reduced resource availability. Results demonstrate the key role of prioritizing one objective over the other, while introducing cultivars more suitable for <b>dry</b> <b>cultivation</b> enables enlarging the frontier of optimal solutions...|$|E

40|$|Because of {{the rapid}} {{depletion}} of water and shortage of labor, farmers in many Asian regions are moving from puddled transplanted rice to dry-seeded rice. However, weed infestations are a serious problem in dry-seeded rice systems because <b>dry</b> <b>cultivation</b> practices and aerobic soil conditions are conducive to the germination and growth of weeds. A field {{study was conducted in}} the wet season of 2011 and the dry season of 2012 to evaluate the effect of two rice cultivars and different herbicides on weed growth and rice yield under dry-seeded rice. The rice cultivars (one hybrid and one inbred) were dry-seeded at 20 - 22 kgseedha- 1 with a combine drill fitted with knife-point openers. Rice plant densities ranged from 44 to 56 plantsm- 2 in the first season and from 67 to 77 plantsm- 2 in the second season. Weed density, weed biomass, rice panicle number, and rice yield were not influenced by the cultivars; however, they were strongly influenced by the weed control treatments. In terms of percent, the hybrid cultivar had 11 - 12 % higher yield than the inbred cultivar. Weed competition in the control plots (one hand-weeding) lowered yield by 39 - 41 % compared with the weed-free plots. All herbicides significantly reduced weed biomass compared with the control treatment, providing 75 - 93 % weed control. Herbicide-treated plots had similar grain yield and the yield in these plots was 76 - 86 % of the yield of the weed-free plots (4. 2 - 4. 4 tha- 1), suggesting further scope to improve rice yield in dry-seeded systems.

40|$|Aims Quantitative {{study of}} root growth pattern in rice (Oryza sativa) {{is of great}} {{significance}} for guiding management regulation and genetic improvement. Our objective was to elucidate the characteristics of root growth and distribution in rice under different conditions of cultivation. Methods We conducted pot experiments involving different nitrogen rates, water regimes and rice cultivars with the root shelf method. Root indices were measured at the jointing and heading stages, including total dry weight (TRW), adventitious root number (ARN), and morphological indices (length, surface area and volume) of threetypes of roots (adventitious, fine and coarse lateral roots). Important findings The observed root indices increased from the jointing stage to the heading stage in all treatments. There were significant differences in root indices among the three nitrogen rates, and each index increased with increasing nitrogen rates at both stages. In the water regime experiment, {{there was no significant}} difference in ARN between irrigation (W 2) and constant water (W 1), but the other indices of W 2 were highest at both stages. There were no significant differences in TRW and morphological indices of coarse lateral roots between W 1 and <b>dry</b> <b>cultivation</b> (W 3) at the jointing stage. The other indices at the jointing stage and all indices at the heading stage were lowest with W 3. All indices were significantly highest in the ‘Yangdao 6 ’ (V 3) cultivar, but similar in ‘Nipponbare’ (V 1) and ‘Wuxiangjing 14 ’ (V 2) cultivars. In addition, the roots extended more deeply into soil from the jointing to the heading stage, but were mainly distributed in the top 5 cm. Lower nitrogen and water supply would promote spreading of roots in the subsoil (< 5 cm) and enhance the proportions of fine and coarse lateral roots. As compared with V 3, the roots of V 1 and V 2 extended more deeply into soil. We concluded that proper nitrogen fertilization and water control could optimize the growth and distribution characteristics of different types of rice roots and this could be influenced by the specific cultivar...|$|E
