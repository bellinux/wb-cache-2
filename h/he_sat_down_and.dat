5|$|Having {{heard all}} of that, the brother took two pistols, poured more gunpowder, and {{sharpened}} the flints; {{he put the}} pistols into his belt, placed the knife between them, and slung a musket over his shoulder. He set forth. He passed through the dark forest; he came beneath the stair-like cliff; {{the moon and the}} stars were shining, so it was like a day; a silence all around him, pleasant; <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> lit his pipe. Before long a wisp of cloud showed from the direction of Mount Rumija; there came a roar and bluster, and everything happened as the sick man said. His hair rose so that three times he jammed his cap down on his head. Finally, three bulls fell down from the storm cloud and started to fight; all as it was said. He stabbed the pied bull in the neck with the knife; it staggered and fell; the light-haired bull got encouraged. Then he stabbed the dark-haired bull, and it slumped; the light-haired was finishing them off with its horns. This was not enough for him, and, fearing that the cut bulls could still rise up, he kept on striking them with the knife as long as there was a breath in their bodies. The storm cloud suddenly disappeared; together with it, the light-haired bull vanished. Again the moon and the stars shone; again a silence and blessedness. He was going back home as if flying; when he arrived he found his brother sitting by the hearth, placing logs on the fire, healthy as if he had never been sick.|$|E
25|$|By chance, at a {{reception}} Asad met Pola, an American of Polish origin who {{was destined to}} become his third wife (d. 2007). She was a young, beautiful and intelligent woman. He {{fell in love with}} her and when he came to know that she had already embraced Islam he decided to marry her, despite the difference of age and temperament. But under the rules of the Foreign Office, he was bound to get prior permission to marry a non-Pakistani national. He applied through the proper channels but the Governor-General rejected his application. So, he submitted his resignation from the Foreign Service, divorced his Arabian wife (Munira, d. 1978) and in the inspiring company of his new wife, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> wrote his extraordinary The Road to Mecca.|$|E
25|$|Furtwängler resumed conducting. On April 25, 1935, he {{returned}} to the Berlin Philharmonic with a program dedicated to Beethoven. Many people who had boycotted the orchestra during his absence came to the concert to support him. He was called out seventeen times. On May 3, in his dressing room before conducting the same program, he was informed that Hitler and his entire staff would attend the concert. He was given the order to welcome Hitler with the Nazi salute. Furtwängler was so furious that he ripped the wooden panelling off a radiator. Franz Jastrau, the manager of the orchestra, suggested that he keep his baton in his right hand all the time. When he entered the hall, all the Nazi leaders were present making the Hitler salute, but Furtwängler kept hold of his baton and began the concert immediately. Hitler probably could not have imagined that such an affront was possible but decided to put up a good show: <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> the concert went on.|$|E

500|$|Metallica wrote {{a tribute}} to Burton titled [...] "To Live Is to Die" [...] for ...And Justice for All. Burton also {{received}} a writing credit for the lyrics and bass parts that were taken from unused bass recordings done by Burton which were re-recorded by Jason Newsted. A non-Metallic{{a tribute to}} Burton is the song [...] "In My Darkest Hour" [...] by thrash metal band Megadeth. According to Dave Mustaine, due to hearing of Burton's death, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> wrote the music for the song in one sitting. The lyrics, however, are unrelated to Burton's death. Mustaine was Metallica's lead guitarist {{in the early days}} and was a close friend of Burton at the time.|$|E
500|$|By December 1972, having {{recorded}} Machine Head, Made in Japan and the yet to {{be released}} Who Do We Think We Are with Deep Purple, Gillan finally decided the workload had driven him to exhaustion. Unlike some band members, he was unhappy about Made in Japan, and disliked live albums in general. He tended {{to go into the}} studio after the rest of the band had recorded and finished the backing tracks, particularly for Who Do We Think We Are, to lay down his vocals separately. He had been continually at loggerheads with Blackmore, disagreeing about music regularly, which culminated in Gillan writing [...] "Smooth Dancer" [...] about him. While on tour in Dayton, Ohio, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> wrote a resignation letter to the band's managers, stating he intended to leave the band, effective from 30 June 1973.|$|E
500|$|Greene {{and middle}} linebacker Jack Lambert became the {{emotional}} leaders of Pittsburgh's defensive squad. Greene {{was described as}} a huge presence {{both on and off the}} field. Once, in the locker room, a teammate was loudly voicing his discontent over the long and cold practice they had just gone through as he yanked off his equipment. At a nearby locker, Greene lifted his head and silently glared at him. [...] "Believe me, that's all Joe did, he never even said anything," [...] Joe Gordon of the Steelers front office recalled. [...] "I don't think the other players saw Joe glare at him. I think the other player just felt it, and then <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> never said another word." [...] A natural leader, Greene was named the captain of the defense in 1977. His leadership was also channeled to the offense; Lynn Swann, a wide receiver, considered Greene a mentor. [...] "If you were giving less than 100 percent, he let you know one way or the other," [...] said Swann.|$|E

60|$|Grant felt {{scarcely}} {{capable of}} standing. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> heavily <b>and</b> fumbled for his pipe, while George {{turned his attention}} to the horse again.|$|R
2500|$|Cowen {{was accused}} of 'conduct unbecoming', over {{comments}} he made in the Dáil when, {{at the end of}} a heated exchange, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> spoke to Tánaiste Mary Coughlan; Dáil microphones picked up the Taoiseach using the word [...] "fuckers", though he was not referring to any opposition politician.|$|E
2500|$|A {{producer}} J.R. Rotem {{also spoke}} about {{working on the}} album, saying that 50 Cent is into [...] "soulful" [...] music, and <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> gave him numerous tacks and that on this album, 50 Cent was [...] " [...] to bring a very powerful new sound", and that is would be a [...] "remarkable project". Play-N-Skillz also confirmed working with 50 Cent for the BISD project, saying: ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{he knelt}} {{to help a}} recruit load his rifle during the Battle of Chancellorsville on Plank Road, George Right Smith was also struck in the back by a mini-ball. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> leaned back against a tree {{thinking}} he [...] "would surely die." [...] But, {{after a few minutes}} he found that the bullet had been spent after passing through his bed-roll leaving only a minor wound.|$|E
60|$|The man {{arrived in}} a few minutes. After <b>he</b> had <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> had taken the cigar Acton offered him, {{he was ready to}} talk business.|$|R

2500|$|Another of Harlow's students, William Mason, {{who also}} {{conducted}} deprivation experiments elsewhere, said that Harlow [...] "kept {{this going to}} the point where it was clear to many people that the work was really violating ordinary sensibilities, that anybody with respect for life or people would find this offensive. It's as if <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> said, 'I'm only going to be around another ten years. What I'd like to do, then, is leave a great big mess behind.' If that was his aim, he did a perfect job." ...|$|E
2500|$|With iron-like tenacity, {{he managed}} to gain his room, where <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> said: [...] "Now all organs are destroyed. Must make new". Then, he turned to Bennett, smiling: [...] "Tonight you come dinner. I must make body work". As he spoke, a great spasm of pain shook his body and blood gushed from an ear. Bennett thought: [...] "He has a {{cerebral}} haemorrhage. He will kill himself {{if he continues to}} force his body to move". But then he reflected: [...] "He has to do all this. If he allows his body to stop moving, he will die. He has power over his body".|$|E
2500|$|Chang {{paced the}} sidelines during {{changeovers}} as he risked {{not being able}} to get up if <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> ate bananas and drank water at every opportunity. He also adopted some unusual tactics in an attempt to overcome his cramps such as hitting the ball high into the air on many points to slow the game down (known as [...] "moon balls"), and began to go for more winners in order to shorten the points. [...] The success of these tactics caused Lendl, known {{to be one of the}} least easily fazed players, to lose his rhythm and also prompted him to swear at the umpire and the crowd, especially after losing a key point in the fifth set when Chang shocked him by delivering an under-arm serve.|$|E

2500|$|... 53 Then each of {{them went}} home, 1 while Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. 2 Early {{in the morning he}} came again to the temple. All the people came to him and <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> began to teach them. 3 The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery; and making her stand before all of them, 4 they said to him, ‘Teacher, this woman was caught in the very act of {{committing}} adultery. 5 Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?’ 6 They said this to test him, so that they might have some charge to bring against him. Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground. 7 When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, ‘Let anyone among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.’ 8 And once again he bent down and wrote on the ground. 9 When they heard it, they went away, one by one, beginning with the elders; and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him. 10 Jesus straightened up and said to her, ‘Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?’ 11 She said, ‘No one, sir.’ And Jesus said, ‘Neither do I condemn you. Go your way, and from now on do not sin again.’ ...|$|E
2500|$|Ryan Green came up {{with the}} idea for the game when Joel was four. He and Amy, both devout Christians, felt that the added years they had with Joel from the {{original}} diagnosis were a miracle. Prior to the idea, Green had written some smaller games that were meant to be more emotional, such as Giga Wife, which demonstrated how one's interactions with a spouse could be negatively compared to a Tamagotchi-like game. While at church, Ryan {{came up with}} the idea for That Dragon, Cancer during their reflection on the past few years, specifically recalling one night at the hospital where he was trying to stop Joel from crying but anything he did seemed to make his crying worse; only after <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> prayed to God did Joel stop crying; Ryan recalled how that reminded him of a video game with subverted game mechanics. He wanted to relay his experiences of raising Joel to a larger audience, and felt that an interactive video game would be a better medium to express a message of grace. Ryan stated that with video games [...] "you can create this world and ask the player to live in it and love what you have created". The name of the game is taken from a story that the Greens had told their other sons about Joel's illness through an allegory about how Joel was a brave knight fighting a dragon named Cancer.|$|E

60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> {{abruptly}} <b>and</b> {{heavily in}} the easy chair, seemed almost to fall into it. He leant forward with his brows {{on his hands and}} became motionless.|$|R
60|$|Ginger 'arf got up, but Sam {{gave him}} a look <b>and</b> <b>'e</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> agin, <b>and</b> then they all sat quiet while the nevy went on telling them about 'is gal.|$|R
60|$|Now <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> again paused {{before he}} went on with his talk.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> {{commenced}} to eat. Then, of a sudden, he uttered an exclamation.|$|E

60|$|The {{front door}} slammed violently, and Jackson, {{advancing}} cautiously to the window, saw {{the form of}} his wife sailing majestically up the passage. Then <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> again <b>and</b> resumed his meditations.|$|R
