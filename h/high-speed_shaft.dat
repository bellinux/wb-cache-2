Using a new approach derived from the optimum seeking methods category, genericall called Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT), the proposed control solution aims at driving the average position of the operating point near to optimality.

30|$|The {{main problem}} {{for using the}} {{framework}} oil-seal of ranging armâ€™s <b>high-speed</b> <b>shaft</b> is its premature failure, i.e., the failure before the service life of the framework oil-seal. The main causes of the premature failure for the framework oil-seal at the ranging arm shaft I are as follows: poor quality framework oil-seal, e.g., poor quality port, and defects; poor quality of self-tightening spring; the magnitude interference between port inner diameter and shaft I outer diameter is too small, which results in low radial pressure; and the material of framework oil-seal is not good, which results in wearing out at port. Design and machining: there are some misalignments at some positions, such as ranging arm, shaft I and bearing cup; there is a low degree of finish at shaft I that amounted with framework oil-seal; and inappropriate heat treatment, etc. Assembly: damage on the port of framework oil-seal, inclination of bearing cup, loose spring, different type of grease or different quantify of grease on oil-seal port and shaft surface. To overcome {{the problems associated with}} the framework oil-seal of ranging arm shaft I, and to increase the sealing reliability of <b>high-speed</b> <b>shaft</b> of ranging arm, the following measures were taken: select high quality framework oil-seals; maintain the machining precision of key components; checking and maintenance on oil leakage of the framework oil-seal.|$|E

This paper describes tests that have been conducted and methods that have been developed for turbo-Brayton components and systems to assure reliable operation. The turbomachines used in these coolers employ self-acting gas bearings to support the miniature <b>high-speed</b> <b>shafts,</b> thus providing vibration-free operation. Because the bearings are self-acting, rubbing contact occurs during initial start-up and shutdown of the machines. Bearings and shafts are designed to endure multiple stop/start cycles without producing particles or surface features that would impair the proper operation of the machines. Test results are presented for a variety of turbomachines used in these systems. The tests document extended operating life and start/stop cycling behavior for machines over a range of time and temperature scales. Contaminants such as moisture and other residual gas impurities can be a source of degraded operation if they freeze out in sufficient quantities to block flow passages or if they mechanically affect the operation of the machines. A post-fabrication bakeout procedure has been successfully used to reduce residual internal contamination to acceptable levels in a closed cycle system. The process was developed during space qualification tests on the NICMOS cryocooler. Moisture levels were sampled over a six-month time interval confirming the effectiveness of the technique.

40|$|In view of {{the problem}} that the fault signal of the rolling bearing is weak and the fault feature is {{difficult}} to extract in the strong noise environment, a method based on minimum entropy deconvolution (MED) and local mean deconvolution (LMD) is proposed to extract the weak fault features of the rolling bearing. Through {{the analysis of the}} simulation signal, we find that LMD has many limitations for the feature extraction of weak signals under strong background noise. In order to eliminate the noise interference and extract the characteristics of the weak fault, MED is employed as the pre-filter to remove noise. This method is applied to the weak fault feature extraction of rolling bearings; that is, using MED to reduce the noise of the wind turbine gearbox test bench under strong background noise, and then using the LMD method to decompose the denoised signals into several product functions (PFs), and finally analyzing the PF components that have strong correlation by a cyclic autocorrelation function. The finding is that the failure of the wind power gearbox is generated from the micro-bending of the <b>high-speed</b> <b>shaft</b> and the pitting of the # 10 bearing outer race at the output end of the <b>high-speed</b> <b>shaft.</b> This method is compared with LMD, which shows the effectiveness of this method.

5000|$|The {{plane was}} {{conceived}} as a fast light bomber and reconnaissance plane. To obtain high speed and good aerodynamics, it was powered by two M-103 inline engines in tandem in a fuselage nose, driving two contra-rotating coaxial three-blade propellers. The design had quite unusual look, with long fuselage nose and a crew cab moved rearwards, towards double tailfin. Wings had a fighter-like form and their span was rather short. The VVIA under Bolkhovitinov was enlarged to tackle the expected problems {{in the design of}} the Bolkhovitnov S. The rear engine was geared to two <b>high-speed</b> <b>shafts</b> which passed either side of the forward engine to drive the rear propeller gearbox, whilst the forward engine and gearbox drove the forward propeller via shaft through the middle of the rear propeller gearbox. The structure of the S was predominantly light alloy stressed skin, the wing having two spars with heavy flush-rivetted upper and lower skins, and the fuselage built up from pre-formed upper, lower, and side panels attached to four longerons to give a strong but relatively simple structure to build. A total of 29 electrical actuators drove the Fowler Flaps, undercarriage, (rotating 90deg to lie flat in the wing), exit flap of the large common radiator duct, and many other services. The tail unit consisted of twin fins with rudders attached to the tips of the tailplane, variable geared elevators and separate servo and trim tabs on elevators, and rudders. Detail design of the aircraft began in 1937 and construction in July [...] The first prototype S-1 was built in 1939, but it was made in order to evaluate an airframe only and therefore was powered by only one engine M-103. It was unarmed and fitted with a fixed skid landing gear. It first flew on January 29, 1940, with B.N. Kudrin at the controls. A maximum speed was 400 km/h. The second prototype S-2 was powered by two engines and was armed with a single machinegun and bombs. Four 100 kg bombs were carried vertically in a bay between pilot and a rear gunner-navigator, under a common canopy. Its state testing started from March 20, 1940, and lasted until July 1940. A maximum speed reached was 570 km/h (354 mph). The plane had good handling, except for take-off and landing, which were difficult due to high wing loading. Its range and speed were also lower than estimated. As a result, it was decided to improve the plane further. However, the plane was not developed in a favour of next Bolkhovitinov designs.|$|R

The principal goal of the present paper is to study experimentally the effect of the impact load on the dynamic behaviour of a rotor system supported on the AMB.

40|$|A primary {{problem in}} the turbine {{industry}} {{is associated with the}} mitigation of bending vibration modes of <b>high-speed</b> rotating <b>shafts.</b> This is especially pertinent at speeds approaching the critical frequencies. Here, a shaft, complete with eccentric sleeves at the free ends, is designed and developed, with a view to passively control critical speeds and vibration induced bending. In this article, using the Extended HamiltonÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s principle, the equations of motion (axial, torsional, inplane and out-of-plane bending) for a rotating flexible shaft are derived; considering non-constant rotating speed, Coriolis and centrifugal forces, with the associated boundary conditions due to the eccentric sleeves and torsional springs in angular deformations of lateral vibrations in bending. The numerical dynamic analysis showed that considering the sleeves as flexible only had a small effect upon the first critical speed of the shaft. Therefore, rigid body modelling of the sleeves is sufficient to capture the essential dynamics of the system. The derived equations of motion with the associated boundary conditions show {{that in the case of}} constant rotating speed, the eccentric sleeves are coupling xy-bending with xz-bending and also torsion. Also the derived equations of motion and the associated boundary conditions in the case of non-constant rotating speed are essentially nonlinear due to inertia terms.

40|$|Traditional {{techniques}} for balancing long, flexible, <b>high-speed</b> rotating <b>shafts</b> are inadequate over {{a full range}} of shaft speeds. This problem is compounded by limitations within the manufacturing process, which have resulted in increasing problems with lateral vibrations and hence increased the failure rates of bearings in practical applications. There is a need to develop a novel strategy for balancing these coupling shafts that is low cost, robust under typically long-term operating conditions and amenable to on-site remediation. This paper proposes a new method of balancing long, flexible couplings by means of a pair of balancing sleeve arms that are integrally attached to each end of the coupling shaft. Balance corrections are applied to the free ends of the arms in order to apply a corrective centrifugal force to the coupling shaft in order to limit shaft-end reaction forces and to impart a corrective bending moment to the drive shaft that limits shaft deflection. The aim {{of this paper is to}} demonstrate the potential of this method, via the mathematical analysis of a plain, simply supported tube with uniform eccentricity and to show that any drive shaft, even with irregular geometry and/or imbalance, can be converted to an equivalent encastre case. This allows for the theoretical possibility of eliminating the first simply supported critical speed, thereby reducing the need for very large lateral critical speed margins, as this requirement constrains design flexibility. Although the analysis is performed on a sub 15 MW gas turbine, it is anticipated that this mechanism would be beneficial on any shaft system with high-flexibility/shaft deflection...|$|R
40|$|The paper furthers the {{analysis}} of a recently proposed balancing methodology for <b>high-speed,</b> flexible <b>shafts.</b> This mechanism imparts corrective balancing moments, having the effect of simulating the fixing moments of equivalent double or single encastre mounted shafts. This is shown to theoretically eliminate/nullify the 1 st lateral critical speed (LCS), and thereby facilitate safe operation with reduced LCS margins. The paper extends previously reported research to encompass a more generalised case of multiple, concentrated, residual imbalances, thereby facilitating analysis of any imbalance distribution along the shaft. Solutions provide greater insight of the behaviour of the balancing sleeve concept, and the beneficial implications for engineering design. Specifically: 1) a series of concentrated imbalances {{can be regarded as}} an equivalent level of uniform eccentricity, and balance sleeve compensation is equally applicable to a generalised unbalanced distribution, 2) compensation depends on the sum of the applied balancing sleeve moments and can therefore be achieved using a single balancing sleeve (thereby simulating a single encastre shaft), 3) compensation of the 2 nd critical speed, {{and to a lesser extent}} higher orders, is possible by use of two balancing sleeves, positioned at shaft ends, 4) the concept facilitates on-site commissioning of trim balance which requires a means of adjustment at only one end of the shaft, 5) the Reaction Ratio, RR, (simply supported/ encastre), is independent of residual eccentricity, so that the implied benefits resulting from the ratio (possible reductions in the equivalent level of eccentricity) are additional to any balancing procedures undertaken prior to encastre simulation. Analysis shows that equivalent reductions in the order of 1 / 25 th, are possible. Experimental measurements from a scaled model of a typical drive coupling employed on an industrial gas turbine package, loaded asymmetrically with a concentrated point of imbalance, are used to support {{the analysis}} and conclusions...|$|R
40|$|An aero-engine {{bearing chamber}} is a {{structure}} {{that is used to}} contain and collect oil used in lubricating and cooling the bearings supporting the <b>high-speed</b> engine <b>shafts.</b> There are various bearings in an aero-engine. Within the bearing chambers, there are typically the bearings, rotating shafts, seals and gears (in some designs). The walls of the bearing chamber are stationary and there are vents and sumps to take out the oil, via an offtake pipe, and the sealing air. The oil collected via the sump and vents is recycled and used again in the loop. To prevent oil degradation and reduce chance of coking in the chamber, it is desired that all of the oil goes through the recycling loop, with no oil staying longer than necessary in the chamber. The sealing air is used to maintain a positive pressure to keep the oil within the chamber. The flow inside a bearing chamber is highly turbulent and consists of a rotating mixture of oil and air. A smaller amount of the oil, mostly as oil-droplets, exits at the vents and is separated from the air using de-aerators [1]. It is expected that by gravity, most of the oil collects at the sump and can be easily scavenged. This is provided the sump can be large enough. The geometry of a bearing chamber is, however, complex largely because of space limitations. It is very important that oil is not resident longer than necessary to prevent over-heating and therefore deterioration or coking. Experimental observations by Chandra & Simmons [2], have shown that bearing chambers with deep sumps perform better that those with shallow sumps. Since shallow sumps are inevitable, a number of innovative studies have been done to improve bearing chamber designs. The presence of air in the oil (e. g. as bubbles) reduces the efficiency of the scavenging pump. Other factors such as oil momentum and windage can take oil away from the off-take pipe potentially increasing oil residence volume. Chandra & Simmons [2] placed inserts such as grille cover, perforated plate, etc, on a side of the bearing wall and improvements in the residence volume were seen. In this work, we are looking at a detailed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of one of the inserts that performed well. This will aid understanding of the flow characteristics of using an insert to improve oil residence in a bearing chamber...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the direct}} current (DC) offset {{cancellation}} and S transform-based diagnosis method is verified using three case studies. For DC offset cancellation, correlated kurtosis (CK) {{is used instead}} of the cross-correlation coefficient {{in order to determine}} the optimal iteration number. Compared to the cross-correlation coefficient, CK enhances the DC offset cancellation ability enormously because of its excellent periodic impulse signal detection ability. Here, it has been proven experimentally that it can effectively diagnose the implanted bearing fault. However, the proposed method is less effective in the case of simultaneously present bearing and gear faults, especially for extremely weak bearing faults. In this circumstance, the iteration number of DC offset cancellation is determined directly by the <b>high-speed</b> <b>shaft</b> gear mesh frequency order. For the planetary gearbox, the application of the proposed method differs from the fixed-axis gearbox, because of its complex structure. For those small fault frequency parts, such as planet gear and ring gear, the DC offset cancellationâ€™s ability is less effective than for the fixed-axis gearbox. In these studies, the S transform is used to display the time-frequency characteristics of the DC offset cancellation processed results; the performances are evaluated, and the discussions are given.

More recently, interest has been growing in applying foil bearings to aircraft gas turbine engines. They offer potential improvements in efficiency and power density, decreased maintenance costs, and other secondary benefits. The goal of applying foil air bearings to aircraft gas turbine engines prompted the fabrication of this test rig. The facility enables bearing designers to test potential bearing designs with shafts that simulate the rotating components of a target engine without the high cost of building actual flight hardware. The data collected from this rig {{can be used to make}} changes to the shaft and bearings in subsequent design iterations. The rest of this article describes the new test rig and demonstrates some of its capabilities with an initial simulated shaft system. The test rig has two support structures, each housing a foil air journal bearing. The structures are designed to accept any size foil journal bearing smaller than 63 mm (2. 5 in.) in diameter. The bearing support structures are mounted to a 91 - by 152 -cm (3 - by 5 -ft) table and can be separated by as much as 122 cm (4 ft) and as little as 20 cm (8 in.) to accommodate a wide range of shaft sizes. In the initial configuration, a 9. 5 -cm (3. 75 -in.) impulse air turbine drives the test shaft. The impulse turbine, as well as virtually any number of "dummy" compressor and turbine disks, can be mounted on the shaft inboard or outboard of the bearings. This flexibility allows researchers to simulate various engine shaft configurations. The bearing support structures include a unique bearing mounting fixture that rotates to accommodate a laserbased alignment system. This can measure the misalignment of the bearing centers in each of 2 translational degrees of freedom and 2 rotational degrees of freedom. In the initial configuration, with roughly a 30. 5 -cm- (12 -in. -) long shaft, two simulated aerocomponent disks, and two 50. 8 -cm (2 -in.) foil journal bearings, the rig can operate at 65, 000 rpm at room temperature. The test facility can measure shaft displacements in both the vertical and horizontal directions at each bearing location. Horizontal and vertical structural vibrations are monitored using accelerometers mounted on the bearing support structures. This information is used to determine system rotordynamic response, including critical speeds, mode shapes, orbit size and shape, and potentially the onset of instabilities. Bearing torque can be monitored as well to predict the power loss in the foil bearings. All of this information is fed back and forth between NASA and the foil bearing designers in an iterative fashion to converge on a final bearing and shaft design for a given engine application. In addition to its application development capabilities, the test rig offers several unique capabilities for basic bearing research. Using the laser alignment system mentioned earlier, the facility will be used to map foil air journal bearing performance. A known misalignment of increasing severity will be induced to determine the sensitivity of foil bearings to misalignment. Other future plans include oil-free integral starter generator testing and development, and dynamic load testing of foil journal bearings...|$|R
