50|$|However, in {{some cases}} {{it has been shown that}} <b>declines</b> <b>of</b> one partner in a {{mutualism}} do not lead to significant declines in the other. For example, a Hawaiian vine (Freycinetia arborea) was pollinated in the nineteenth century by four species of birds. These bird species are all now either locally endangered or extinct. Despite this, F. Arborea continues to survive in reasonable abundance, but is now mainly pollinated by the recently introduced white-eye (Zosterops japonica) (Cox and Elmqvist 2000). In this case, conservation of the mutualism was not required to maintain the F. Arborea population. There are probably no published estimates <b>of</b> how frequently <b>declines</b> <b>of</b> one species do not result in <b>declines</b> <b>of</b> that species’ mutualist, due to a ‘replacement’ mutualist. However, judging by the few examples in the literature where this replacement has been reported to have happened, it seems to be a relatively rare occurrence.|$|R
40|$|Research into {{population}} <b>declines</b> <b>of</b> North American {{bird species}} has mainly {{focused on the}} fragmentation of habitat on the breeding or wintering grounds [Robinson, S. K., Thompson, F. R., Donovan, T. M., Whitehead, D. R. & Faaborg, J. (1995) Science 267, 1987 – 1990]. In contrast, research into <b>declines</b> <b>of</b> European species has mainly focused on intensification of agriculture [Donald, P. F., Green, R. E. & Heath, M. F. (2001) Proc. R. Soc. London Ser. B 268, 25 – 29] and {{the role played by}} the atmospheric deposition of pollutants, in particular, acid rain [Graveland, J. (1998) Environ. Rev. 6, 41 – 54]. However, despite widespread unexplained <b>declines</b> <b>of</b> bird populations in regions of heavy wet acid ion deposition [Sauer, J. R., Hines, J. E. & Fallon, J. (2001) The North American Breeding Bird Survey Results and Analysis 1966 – 2000 (Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, Laurel, MD) ], no North American studies have presented evidence linking such widespread terrestrial bird declines to acid rain. To address the question of the role played by acid rain in population <b>declines</b> <b>of</b> eastern North American songbird species, we combine data from several sources. We use a multiple logistic regression model to test for adverse effects of acid rain on the Wood Thrush, while controlling for regional abundance, landscape-level habitat fragmentation, elevation, soil pH, and vegetation. We show a strong, highly significant, negative effect of acid rain on the predicted probability of breeding by this species, and interactions with elevation, low pH soils, and habitat fragmentation that worsen these negative effects. Our results suggest an important role for acid rain in recent <b>declines</b> <b>of</b> some birds breeding in the eastern United States, particularly in high elevation zones with low pH soils, and show the need to consider other large-scale influences, in addition to habitat fragmentation, when addressing bird population declines...|$|R

40|$|Aging is {{characterized}} by progressive, degenerative changes in many tissues. To elucidate the relationships among degenerative changes in Caenorhabditis elegans, we developed methods to measure age-related changes quantitatively and analyzed correlations among these changes by using a longitudinal study. The age-related <b>declines</b> <b>of</b> pharyngeal pumping and body movement were positively correlated {{with each other and}} lifespan. These findings suggest that the <b>declines</b> <b>of</b> pharyngeal pumping and body movement cause a decline in survival probability or that a shared regulatory system mediates the declines in pharyngeal pumping, body movement, and survival probability. Furthermore, measurements of these processes can be used to predict lifespan and detect premature aging. The <b>declines</b> <b>of</b> physiological processes were measured in daf- 2, age- 1, daf- 16, eat- 2, and clk- 1 mutants that have altered lifespans. Each mutant strain displayed changes in one or more age-related declines, but the correlations among age-related changes were similar to WT. These measurements were used to generate a system of four stages that describes the aging process and is useful for the analysis of genetic and environmental effects on aging...|$|R
