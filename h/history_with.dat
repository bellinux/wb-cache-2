40|$|A {{measure of}} the non-coaxiality {{involved}} in progressive deformation histories is proposed {{in the form of}} the kinematical vorticity number, Wk. This number is a {{measure of the}} relative effects of rotation of material lines (relative to the instantaneous stretching axes) and of stretching of these material lines. As such, Wk, is a measure of the instantaneous degree of non-coaxiality. A detailed example is first presented in the form of a progressive simple shearing in which the shear plane rotates relative to an external coodinate system. This is followed by examples of more complicated deformation histories. Three specific types of progressive, isochoric (constant volume) deformation histories are recognized. Those for which 0 ≤ Wk 0 is a special case of these corresponding to a coaxial <b>history.</b> <b>Histories</b> <b>with</b> Wk > 0 are non-coaxial. Those <b>histories</b> <b>with</b> Wk = 1 correspond to progressive simple shearing. Those <b>histories</b> <b>with</b> 1 < Wk < ∞ are pulsating and lines that have been extended may be shortened in future increments...|$|R
