5|$|I {{remember}} {{being in the}} back part of the studio, and we were sitting there {{late at night and}} writing. I was strolling through some sounds and came upon a particular sound from a steel acoustic guitar. I played these really beautiful chord changes that eventually led to 'My All.' She started singing and I started playing, and we came up with the basis for the song. I put a little drum groove <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was one of the easier songs to write with her.|$|E
5|$|Initial Vulcanian {{activity}} {{is characterized by}} a series of short-lived explosions, lasting a few minutes to a few hours and typified by the ejection of volcanic bombs and blocks. These eruptions wear down the lava dome holding the magma <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> disintegrates, leading to much more quiet and continuous eruptions. Thus an early sign of future Vulcanian {{activity is}} lava dome growth, and its collapse generates an outpouring of pyroclastic material down the volcano's slope.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{turbines}} reached {{grid parity}} (the {{point at which}} the cost of wind power matches traditional sources) in some areas of Europe in the mid-2000s, and in the US around the same time. Falling prices continue to drive the levelized cost <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> has been suggested that it has reached general grid parity in Europe in 2010, and will reach the same point in the US around 2016 due to an expected reduction in capital costs of about 12%.|$|E

5|$|During Sanger's 1916 {{speaking}} tour, she promoted {{birth control}} clinics {{based on the}} Dutch model she had observed during her 1914 trip to Europe. Although she inspired many local communities to create birth control leagues, no clinics were established. Sanger therefore resolved to create a birth control clinic in New York that would provide free contraceptive services to women. New York state law prohibited the distribution of contraceptives or even contraceptive information, but Sanger hoped to exploit {{a provision in the}} law which permitted doctors to prescribe contraceptives for the prevention of disease. On October 16, 1916, she opened the Brownsville clinic in Brooklyn; it was an immediate success, with over 100 women visiting on the first day.Engelman, p. 79–80. A few days after opening, an undercover policewoman purchased a cervical cap at the clinic, and Sanger was arrested. Refusing to walk, Sanger and a co-worker were dragged out of the clinic by police officers.Engelman, p. 83. The clinic was shut <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was not until 1923 that another birth control clinic was opened in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Finucane {{returned}} to operations on 13 March. 602 were strengthened over {{this time by}} the arrival of Flight Lieutenant James Harry Lacey, an already established fighter pilot with considerable combat experience. Lacey commanded several Flights in 602 over the spring and summer, 1942. By coincidence, Lacey would end the war on 28 aerial victories also. He flew with Finucane and 602 on Circus 114 which targeted the railway yards at Hazebrouck. Finucane fought an Fw 190 from 23 to 8,000ft. He claimed it shot <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was witnessed by Sergeant Paul Green. Fighter Command claimed eight for the loss of six. JG 26 recorded no losses in the battle and the Germans issued a communiqué on losses. Air Chief Marshal Charles Portal requested proof from Sholto Douglas to demonstrate Fighter Command's claims were accurate. Douglas issued him with combat reports from the Kenley Wing which stated two German aircraft were seen to hit the ground and one pilot bailed out. These claims cannot be substantiated through German losses. One source records a loss of Bf 109 from I./ JG 26.|$|E
5|$|On 4 March 1941, Pattle claimed three enemy Fiat G.50bis fighters (nos 22–24) {{belonging}} to 24oGruppo. He claimed the first, while Nigel Cullen — another leading fighter ace — flew as his wingman. Escorting Blenheims to attack Italian warships, the pair were engaged by a lone G.50. Pattle engaged the Fiat and shot it down — its landing gear dropped <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> {{rolled over and}} into a mountainside just north of Himare. Pattle searched for Cullen, expecting him to be behind him but saw {{no sign of the}} Australian. He assumed Cullen had gone off to scout for more enemy aircraft after missing out on Pattle's victory. Now alone, he was attacked by another lone G.50bis while flying towards Vlorë. After a brief combat, he shot down the Fiat. It crashed into the sea southwest of Vlorë harbour. He then became involved with a third such fighter over Valona harbour and claimed to have shot this down into the sea in flames {{on the west side of}} the promontory. After his return to base, he was informed Cullen had been posted missing in action. Pattle and the squadron considered he had most likely been shot down and killed.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s it was {{apparent}} to some that this juggernaut of economic growth was slowing <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> began to become visibly apparent in the early 1970s. The United States grew increasingly dependent on oil importation from OPEC after peaking production in 1970, resulting in oil supply shocks in 1973 and 1979. Stagflation gripped the nation, and the government experimented with wage and price controls under President Nixon.|$|E

In 1989, Sacramento voters voted {{to shut down the}} Rancho Seco power plant. The salient issues were mostly economic; the plant kept breaking <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> had been shut from late 1985 to early 1988 for repairs, forcing the district to buy electricity from neighbors.|$|E
25|$|In 1912, Laue {{was called}} to the University of Zurich as an extraordinarius {{professor}} of physics. In 1913, his father was raised to the ranks of hereditary nobility; Laue then became 'Max von Laue'. In 1914 a new professor extraordinarius chair of theoretical physics had been created at the University of Berlin. Laue was offered the position but turned it <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was offered to Max Born.

25|$|Following the openers is the No. 3 or one-drop batsman. His {{job is to}} {{take over}} from the openers and {{typically}} play a careful and prolonged innings, effectively tying up {{one end of the}} batting. This brings in some stability in the batting, as new batsmen find it difficult to settle <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> helps to have a settled batsman at the other end. The best batsman of the team is usually put at number 3 or 4, to protect him from the difficulties of batting against the best bowlers on a fresh pitch and to allow him to play a long innings.|$|E

25|$|A first innings lead of 248 placed great {{pressure}} on the English batsmen, but their combined experience counted when it was required, and their captain David Gower led the fight-back with a well made 106. Robin Smith was unluckily dismissed for 96. However it was again Terry Alderman's turn with 6 for 128, 4 of them LBWs achieved through either dead straight balls or - his speciality - the late swing from leg stump making them virtually straight balls that the batsmen played across. England had made a solid 359, but their first innings had let them <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> left Australia with a comfortable target of 117 runs for victory on the last day.|$|E
25|$|I {{remember}} somebody {{yelling and}} seeing a big {{ball of fire}} {{near the top of}} the tent. And this ball of fire just got bigger and bigger and bigger. By that time, everybody was panicking. The exit was blocked with the cages that the animals were brought in and out with. And there was a man taking kids and flinging them up and over that cage to get them out. I was sitting up in the bleachers and jumped down — I was three-quarters of the way up. You jump <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was all straw underneath. There was a young man, a kid, and he had a pocketknife. And he slit the tent, took my arm and pulled me out.|$|E
25|$|On 20 August 2010 Graeme Smith {{announced}} that he was to surrender the captaincy in T20 Internationals but continue playing in the format. Cricket South Africa subsequently handed over the captaincy to his deputy Botha. Botha also took the One-Day International captaincy after the 2011 Cricket World Cup when Smith gave up his ODI captaincy. The deciding factor was that Botha had led South Africa to a series win against Australia earlier in 2010 when Smith was absent with injury. Botha's first match as permanent captain was on 7 October 2010 against Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe scored what looked like a competitive 168 however Zimbabwe's bowling attack severely let them <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was easily chased by the South Africans with seven-wickets and five-overs to spare.|$|E

25|$|After almost 80minutes of slow {{temperature}} rise, {{the primary}} loop's four main reactor coolant pumps began to cavitate as a steam bubble/water mixture, rather than water, passed through them. The pumps were shut <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> {{was believed that}} natural circulation would continue the water movement. Steam in the system prevented flow through the core, and as the water stopped circulating it was converted to steam in increasing amounts. About 130minutes after the first malfunction, {{the top of the}} reactor core was exposed and the intense heat caused a reaction to occur between the steam forming in the reactor core and the Zircaloy nuclear fuel rod cladding, yielding zirconium dioxide, hydrogen, and additional heat. This reaction melted the nuclear fuel rod cladding and damaged the fuel pellets, which released radioactive isotopes to the reactor coolant, and produced hydrogen gas that is believed to have caused a small explosion in the containment building later that afternoon.|$|E
25|$|Another MiG-21 {{trying to}} make its way away from the battle zone was being chased by Avraham Salmon. Having spotted Salmon on his tail, Vladimir Zhuravlev was {{maneuvering}} hard to deny Salmon the opportunity to shoot him down. Salmon had already fired a missile that failed to cause any damage, when Spector's 101 Squadron Mirage joined the fight and fired another pair at the MiG. Although at least one struck home, these too failed to bring the aircraft <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> continued to fly away to the northwest. Salmon continued to give chase to the vicinity of Helwan, where he managed to close {{the distance to the}} MiG and emptied his cannon into the aircraft. With both his ammunition and fuel exhausted, he departed the scene. Only years later (see below) was it revealed that Zhuravlev's aircraft had in fact crashed and its pilot killed. Spector and Salmon were both credited with a shared kill, the fifth and last of the battle.|$|E

Both options were turned <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was instead proposed to operate Melbourne as a helicopter carrier.|$|E
