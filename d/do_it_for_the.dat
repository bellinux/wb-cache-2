Hertwig described the subsequent life of her mother who unconditionally glorified her fiancé until confronted with {{his role in the}} Holocaust. Kalder committed suicide in 1983 shortly after giving an interview in Jon Blair's documentary Schindler. Hertwig's experiences in dealing with her father's crimes are detailed in Inheritance, a 2006 documentary directed by James Moll. Appearing in the documentary is Helen Jonas-Rosenzweig, one of Göth's former housemaids. The documentary details the meeting of the two women at the Płaszów memorial site in Poland. Hertwig had requested the meeting, but Jonas-Rosenzweig was hesitant because her memories of Göth and the concentration camp were so traumatic. She eventually agreed after Hertwig wrote to her, [...] "We have to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> murdered people." [...] Jonas felt touched by this sentiment and agreed to meet her.|$|E

[...] She posed nude in an Australian magazine, Black+White, that featured Olympic athletes who were set to compete in Athens in the 2004 Summer Olympics. The expensively printed magazine/book has been produced for the last three Olympic Games and, by the 2004 edition, was considered uncontroversial in Australia with its [...] "artistic" [...] approach to nude photography, and its equal coverage of male and female athletes, although it did create a stir in the United States. She also posed for the 2005 edition of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue. Of posing nude, she said, [...] "if offered the opportunity, I think that it's a personal decision.

Zayat explained, [...] "He can run anywhere... as long as he's happy and healthy... I told ... 'I want to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> sport and not worry about the money and stuff."

Over 60,000 people showed up at Monmouth Park, which featured the Bruce Springsteen song [...] "Born to Run" [...] in the post parade. Viewed as being in even better physical condition than in the Belmont, American Pharoah took the lead in the far turn and easily opened up a five-length lead over the six other horses in the race before Espinoza eased him back as second-place finisher Keen Ice made a strong finishing push. He won the race by [...] lengths with a time of 1:47.95 for the 9-furlong distance. Espinoza quipped, [...] "He was having fun, and so was I."

Hitchens said that [...] "her intention was not to help people", and she lied to donors about how their contributions were used.
