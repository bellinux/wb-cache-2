25|$|The World Rainforest Movement {{has argued}} that poor {{developing}} countries could be pressured to accept reforestation projects under the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism in order to earn foreign exchange simply {{to pay off the}} <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> <b>debt</b> to the World Bank. Tensions also exist over forest management between the sovereignty claims of nations states, arguments about common heritage of mankind and the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities; the Forest Peoples Programme (FPP) arguing the anti-deforestation programs could merely allow financial benefits to flow to national treasuries, privilege would-be corporate forest degraders who manipulate the system by periodically threatening forests, rather than local communities who conserve them. The success of such projects will also depend on the accuracy of the baseline data and the number of countries involved. Further, {{it has been argued that}} if biosequestration is to play a significant role in mitigating anthropogenic climate change then coordinated policies should set a goal of achieving global forest cover to its extent prior to the industrial revolution in the 1800s.|$|E

2500|$|In {{contrast}} to economist Kaplan, {{the author and}} polemecist Matt Taibbi of Rolling Stone Magazine paints a less favorable portrait of Romney's business career (Taibbi also disparages Romney as “self-righteously anal, thin-lipped, [...] Whitest Kids U Know”). [...] According to Taibbi, {{toward the middle of}} his career at Bain Capital, Romney moved away from helping startups, and moved toward leveraged buyouts which involved borrowing money to take over established companies in order to extract as much value as possible from those targeted companies. [...] Taibbi calls this “financial piracy”, while acknowledging that Romney’s leveraged buyouts were not hostile takeovers, and also conceding that some of Bain’s work was not [...] "evil" [...] (such as Bain's successful turnaround of Experian). [...] Taibbi blames the U.S. tax code for making leveraged buyouts possible by allowing companies like Bain to deduct <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> <b>debt</b> they use to acquire targets, and also by allowing individuals like Romney to pay much less than the ordinary tax rate on income. [...] However, the Wall Street Journal reports that Romney likely did not participate in the latter tax rate reductions.|$|E
