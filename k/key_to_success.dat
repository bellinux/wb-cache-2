A project manager from Mitsubishi assisted the team in management of attaining milestones, and according to Goldsworthy, this taught the team a lot about the practices employed by major companies regarding game development.|$|E
40|$|School foodservice {{operations}} {{make up a}} {{large portion}} of the non-commercial foodservice industry. The number of Farm to school (FTS) programs has increased considerably within the school foodservice industry and provide opportunities to source ingredients locally. Due to the Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act, school foodservice employees are faced with the challenge of providing increased amounts of produce to students. FTS programs are being used to help meet this challenge. This study focused on identifying barriers and <b>keys</b> <b>to</b> <b>success</b> when using local produce from FTS programs as well as identifying and assessing differences between barriers and <b>keys</b> <b>to</b> <b>success</b> based on geographic location, and school lunch participation rates. Interviews and a questionnaire were used to identify barriers and <b>keys</b> <b>to</b> <b>success.</b> Barriers identified through interviews included appearance, shelf life, service to students, and availability. <b>Keys</b> <b>to</b> <b>success</b> included exposure and support, service, and employee motivation. In the questionnaire, a five point Likert-type scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree) was used to assess participants 2 ̆ 7 agreement to statements about barriers and <b>keys</b> <b>to</b> <b>success.</b> The barrier items with the highest mean scores were 2 ̆ 2 local produce has a different appearance than non-local produce 2 ̆ 2 (M= 3. 67), 2 ̆ 2 the quality of local produce is better than non-local produce 2 ̆ 2 (M= 3. 61), and 2 ̆ 2 local produce is less available than non-local produce (M= 3. 34) 2 ̆ 2. <b>Keys</b> <b>to</b> <b>success</b> with the highest mean scores included 2 ̆ 2 staff encouraging students to try local produce 2 ̆ 2 (M= 4. 15), 2 ̆ 2 exposing students to local produce consistently 2 ̆ 2 (M= 4. 08), and 2 ̆ 2 presenting local produce attractively to students 2 ̆ 2 (M= 4. 08). Mean scores of agreement toward barriers and <b>keys</b> <b>to</b> <b>success</b> were compared <b>to</b> identify differences between barriers and <b>keys</b> <b>to</b> <b>success</b> based on geographic location and school lunch participation rates. Significant differences based on geographic location and school lunch participation rates were identified at the p 3 ̆c. 05 level. There were no significant differences identified between <b>keys</b> <b>to</b> <b>success</b> based on school lunch participation rates.

5|$|Diefenbaker's {{successful}} leadership race {{had been}} run by Allister Grosart, an executive for McKim Advertising Ltd. Soon {{after taking the}} leadership, Diefenbaker got Grosart to help out at Tory headquarters, and soon appointed him national director {{of the party and}} national campaign manager. Grosart appointed a national campaign committee, something which had not been done previously by the Tories, but which, according to Grosart, provided the organizational <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>success</b> in 1957. The party was ill-financed, having only $1,000,000 to wage the campaign—half what it had in 1953. Grosart divided most of that money equally by constituency, to the disgruntlement of Quebec Tories, who were used to receiving a disproportionate share of the national party's financing.|$|E
5|$|Traditional desert farming {{systems have}} long been {{established}} in North Africa, irrigation being the <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>success</b> {{in an area where}} water stress is a limiting factor to growth. Techniques that can be used include drip irrigation, the use of organic residues or animal manures as fertilisers and other traditional agricultural management practises. Once fertility has been built up, further crop production preserves the soil from destruction by wind and other forms of erosion. It has been found that plant growth-promoting bacteria play a role in increasing the resistance of plants to stress conditions and these rhizobacterial suspensions could be inoculated into the soil {{in the vicinity of the}} plants. A study of these microbes found that desert farming hampers desertification by establishing islands of fertility allowing farmers to achieve increased yields despite the adverse environmental conditions. A field trial in the Sonoran Desert which exposed the roots of different species of tree to rhizobacteria and the nitrogen fixing bacterium Azospirillum brasilense with the aim of restoring degraded lands was only partially successful.|$|E
5|$|To {{promote the}} game, Valve has {{produced}} three machinima trailers depicting {{the game in}} play. The trailers are themed around wartime propaganda news reports for both Germany and the United States. To convey this effect, the trailers make extensive usage of the Source engine's capabilities for film grain, color correction, motion blur and depth of field, as well as sepia toning. The first trailer was released {{as part of the}} game's post-release marketing on December 20, 2005. Entitled Prelude to Victory, the trailer depicted a large firefight in the game as a report from the German perspective, complete with a commentator speaking in the German language. Two further trailers were released to promote the major update to Day of Defeat: Source {{in the second quarter of}} 2006. The trailers, both from the American viewpoint, displayed how the new detonation gameplay worked, emphasising teamwork as the <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>success,</b> as well as introducing the viewer to the two new maps added by the update. To further create interest in the game, Valve has opened Day of Defeat: Source to three free weekends, the first taking place on February 10, 2006, the second on July 8, 2006 and the third on July 4, 2008, where anyone with a Steam account could download and play the game for a maximum of 48 hours free of charge.|$|E

He realises that his pointing out of Kahola's mistakes and arguing with Kahola was not his prerogative, even though Kahola was wrong. He concludes that his arguments ended up angering Kahola {{which led to the}} unfortunate curse, anger being the dreadful enemy of man. Aṣṭāvakra decides to perfect the scriptures – the Vedas, Upavedas, Nyāya, Mīmāṃsā, Dharma, Āgama and other texts. He entreats Uddālaka for instruction in the scriptures. In a short time, Aṣṭāvakra masters all that Uddālaka teaches, helped by his Ekaśruti (ability to forever remember everything that one has heard even once). Uddālaka calls Aṣṭāvakra to give him a final instruction about the Ātman, and orders him to go to the assembly of Janaka with the goal of liberating his father. Uddālaka decides to send the now-repentant Śvetaketu with Aṣṭāvakra, even though the former had insulted the latter in the past. Aṣṭāvakra determines that this task will be his Gurudakṣiṇā, and bows down to Uddālaka. Uddālaka blesses him to be victorious, and so does Sujātā. Aṣṭāvakra undertakes the ambitious journey to Mithilā, along with his uncle Śvetaketu.|$|E
