40|$|The <b>eight-toothed</b> <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> (Ips typographus) is {{the most}} serious insect pest in Central European forests. During the past two decades, extreme {{meteorological}} events and subsequent beetle infestations have killed millions of cubic meters of standing spruce trees. Not all the infested stands could be cleared in time, and priorities in management had to be set. Natural or man-made buffer zones of about 500 meters in width are frequently defined to separate differently managed stands in Central Europe. While the buffer zones seem to be effective in most of the cases, their impact has not been studied in detail. Beetle densities were therefore assessed in three case studies using pheromone traps along transects, leading from infested stands into spruce-free buffer zones. The results of the trap catches allow an estimation of the buffer zone influence on densities and the dispersal of Ips typographus. Beetle densities were found to decrease rapidly with increasing distance from the infested spruce stands. The trap catches were below high-risk thresholds within a few hundred meters of the infested stands. The decrease in catches was more pronounced in open land and in an urban area than in a broadleaf stand. Designed buffer zones of 500 [*]m width without spruce can therefore very probably help to reduce densities of spreading beetles...|$|E
40|$|The Panel on Plant Health {{performed}} a pest categorisation of the <b>eight-toothed</b> <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle,</b> Ips typographus L. (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae), for the EU. I. typographus is a well-defined and distinguishable species, recognised mainly as a pest of spruce (Picea spp.) in Eurasia. It also attacks other conifers such as Abies spp., Larix spp., Pinus spp. and Pseudotsuga menziesii. Native to Eurasia, I. typographus has spread from the native range of spruce to new areas in Eurasia where spruce has been planted, {{and is now}} widely distributed throughout the EU (22 Member states). It is a quarantine pest listed in Annex IIB of Council Directive 2000 / 29 /EC for Ireland and United Kingdom as protected zones. Coniferous wood, bark and wood packaging material are considered as pathways for the pest, which is also able to disperse by flight over tens of kilometres. The insects normally establish on fallen trees but can also mass-attack healthy trees, killing millions of spruces. The males produce pheromones that attract conspecifics of both sexes. Each male attracts one to four females; each female produces 2 – 80 offspring. The insects also inoculate pathogenic fungi to their hosts. There are one to three generations per year. The wide current geographic range of I. typographus {{suggests that it is}} able to establish anywhere in the EU where its hosts are present. Sanitary thinning or clear-felling are the major control methods. Pheromone mass trapping is presently judged unreliable because of the large dispersal capacity of the pest. Quarantine measures are implemented to prevent entry in yet uncolonised areas. All criteria assessed by EFSA for consideration as potential protected zone quarantine pest are met. The criteria for considering I. typographus as a potential regulated nonquarantine pest are not met since plants for planting are not a pathway...|$|E

Analizirana je bila učinkovitost ter selektivnost feromonov. Na treh lokacijah so bile postavljene po štiri pasti znamke Theysohnr. V vsako izmed njih je bil vstavljen feromon določenega proizvajalca, četrta pa je služila kontroli. Izveden je bil t. i. rotacijski poskus. Najučinkovitejši je bil feromon Chalcowitr, sledi mu PC - Ecolurer, najmanj učinkovit pa je bil Chalcopraxr top. Kot najselektivnejši se je izkazal Chalcopraxr top, še posebej na pomembno plenilsko vrsto Nemosoma elongatum. Najmanj selektiven je bil Chalcowitr, ki je tudi edini izmed feromonov, ki privlači tudi osmerozobega smrekovega lubadarja (Ips typographus).

The research took place in 2009 in NW of Slovenia on a plateaunamed Jelovica, on area of the big windthrow in 2006. The efficiency and selectivity were tested for each type of pheromone. Three locations were chosen and on each of them four Theysohnr pheromone traps were set. In three traps were put, separately, one sort of pheromone. The fourth trap was used for control. The rotation experiment was made. The most efficient was pheromone Chalcowitr, next was PC - Ecolurer, the least efficient was Chalcopraxr top.

40|$|The {{effect of}} climate change on the <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> Model {{simulations}} show that an increased frequency in storms and drought periods may result in more frequent and shorter outbreaks of <b>bark</b> <b>beetles.</b> Warmer summers can result in two <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> generations per summer instead of one, giving <b>bark</b> <b>beetles</b> the opportunity to attack forests twice in a single year. By Bjørn Økland, Paal Krokene and Holger Lange In a NORKLIMA project financed by the Research Council of Norway, we have focused on how climate change can affect an important species for Norwegian forestry, namely the <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> (Ips typographus). The <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> {{is one of the}} few insects in Norway capable of killing trees in large numbers, and this makes it an important species in both economic and ecological terms. Recurring outbreaks over the last few centuries have had catastrophic effects on forests in Central and Northern Europe. The most recent outbreak in southern Norway in the 1970 s killed forests equivalent to five million cubic meters of lumber, which at the time was worth about 500 million kroner (about 84 million dollars).

40|$|During {{outbreak}} periods, the European <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> and the North American {{mountain pine}} beetle {{are able to}} kill millions of coniferous trees. Throughout the 20 th century, six outbreaks have occurred in Sweden and four in British Columbia, with about 20 -year intervals in both regions. The outbreaks of the mountain pine beetles seem to grow much larger and last longer compared to the outbreaks of the <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetles.</b> Over the years, the mountain pine beetle has killed about 60 million ha forest or 550 million m 3 trees in British Columbia, which {{is at least one}} hundred times more than for the <b>Spruce</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> in Sweden. Damages of both species have increased markedly in the last forty years. About 750 <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetles</b> per m 2 are necessary to kill a healthy spruce, whereas seven times fewer, i. e., about 110 mountain pine beetles per m 2, are needed to kill a healthy pine. Furthermore, twice as many offspring per m 2 bark are produced by the <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> compared to the mountain pine beetle. An explanation for the large differences in population dynamics between these two beetle species may spring from differences in (1) the availability of host trees, (2) number of specimens required to kill a tree, and (3) reproductive success. The latter is in turn affected by the intraspecific competition, nutrient content, and occurrence of fungi...|$|R

40|$|<b>Spruce</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> (Ips typographus (Linnaeus, 1758)) is {{our most}} serious pests, {{frequently}} invading spruce stands. The most important predators of I. typographus are two species from genus Thanasimus - Thanasimus formicarius (Linnaeus, 1758) and Thanasimus femoralis (Zetterstedt, 1828). Monitoring {{of these three}} species were carried out from April to August, using pheromone traps type Theyson with pheromone lures designed for their capture. New pheromone lure attracting beetles of genus Thanasimus has been tested. It was used a total of six traps that were placed at three locations. Two traps were always placed at one location, one with pheromone lure Pheroprax attracting <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetles</b> and the second one with pheromone lure called Thanasiwit attracting beetles of the genus Thanasimus. All traps were checked once a week. A total of 10 291 of <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetles</b> were captured, 25 specimens of T. formicarius and 7 individuals of T. femoralis. <b>Spruce</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> flight activity had two generations and one sister brood. The first catches were recorded on 26 April 2015 {{and the end of}} the flight activity was recorded on 26 July 2015. The species T. formicarius flight activity was from 12 April 2015 to 2 August 2015 and during this period two generations were recorded. For T. femoralis flight activity was from 17 April 2015 until 9 August 2015, during this period we also recorded two generations, which took place before and after the flight activity of I. typographus. Laboratory work was conducted after the end of captures. From every of sample twenty individuals were dissected and then inspected using a light microscope to presence of pathogens.

40|$|This thesis {{evaluates the}} {{effectiveness}} of defensive techniques against the <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> (Ips typographus L.) with a primary focus on pheromone traps and selected factors affecting their efficacy. The factors tested are the setup system of pheromone traps and type of pheromone dispenser baits, {{the effect on the}} efficacy of pheromone traps of increasing evaporated pheromones, a comparison of the biological efficacy of different types of pheromone dispensers and an assessment of their impact on the swarming curve. In addition, an evaluation of non-traditional methods of forest protection against the <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> (water spraying of whole landings, efficacy of insecticidal sraying of whole landings, and the use of insecticidal nets) was conducted and the possibility of the <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> s sex determination was also examined. When comparing the systems of pheromone traps installation, (1) the standard way was along the stand edge with 20 m space and (2) traps concentrating in the centre of clear cut adjacent to each other with different baiting, the most effective way was found to be the standard trap arrangement and the system with traps installed in line with the dispenser in each pheromone trap. Efficacy decreased with a lower number of pheromone dispensers. The influence of increased amounts of evaporated pheromone on efficacy was tested. Pheromone traps with one, two or three dispensers were compared and it was found that a trap s efficacy was not increased with a higher amount of released pheromone. The Pheagr IT and IT Ecolure Tubus dispensers showed unchanged effectivity throughout the flight activity of <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle,</b> but other dispensers need to be replaced according to the instructions since their efficacy decreases, thus affecting the swarming curve.

50|$|Between 1987 and 2000 {{the largest}} known {{epidemic}} of <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> (Dendroctonus rufipennis) caused {{the death of}} 90% of white, Sitka, and hybrid Lutz spruce, {{almost all of the}} mature spruce trees, in a 3.2 million acre forest in the Kenai Peninsula and Copper River. The <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> {{is a part of the}} native ecosystem, mainly hosted by the white spruce of the dryer interior, in south-central Alaska where the tree loss occurred in apparently healthy old growth forest. One theory about the decimation of trees is that warmer spring and summer temperatures have allowed the beetles an annual reproductive cycle, shortened from every two to three years, while warmer winter temperatures have increased the number of beetles that live through winter to reproduce in spring. In addition to increased temperatures, increased aridity in the region has created dryer forests lowering the production of sap, a barrier defense against insect and fungal pests, in the spruces. Lutz spruces, like its primary host, the white spruce, are more susceptible to <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> damage and suffer a higher mortality rate when infected.|$|R
