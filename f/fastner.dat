40|$|National and International codes focus {{mainly on}} {{structural}} safety and serviceability of structures. Actually, other aspects are becoming of importance {{and therefore they}} will demand updating of design recommandations. One {{of them is the}} fastening technique and in particular anchorage to concrete because of its flexible use in all kinds of structures. In order to ensure their safe and economical use {{in a wide range of}} constructions, qualification, design requirements and installation procedures are to be defined. In Europe, a large number of buildings are in seismic areas and therefore have to be designed according to EC 8. As consequence, anchors must be also qualified and designed for seismic loading according to european design criteria for buildings and other structures. Up to date provisions for qualification of products and design for application of fastener in seismic areas are still in progress. The only reference codes in the world are ACI 355, for qualification of anchors, and 2006 IBC, for designing. This work aims to clarify the understanding of the fundamental principles of the seismic behaviour of <b>fastners</b> to concrete in broad range of applications (connection of partitions, facade elements, equipments especially in strategical buildings as hospitals, connections in composite structures, etc.). The authors focus their attention on the seismic capacity of anchors that transmit structural and non-structural loads from attachments into concrete members. The following crucial points have been reviewed and discussed: load cases including earthquake, cracking of concrete, requirements for ductility, overstrength and failure modes...|$|R

50|$|The company, reorganized as the Fastener Manufacturing and Machine Company, {{moved to}} Hoboken, N.J. in 1901. Gideon Sundback, a Swedish-American {{electrical}} engineer, {{was hired to}} work for the company in 1906. Good technical skills and a marriage to the plant-manager's daughter Elvira Aronson led Sundbäck to the position of head designer. The company moved to Meadville, PA, where it operated for most of the 20th century under the name Talon, Inc. After his wife's death in 1911, Sundback devoted himself to improving the fastener, and by December 1913 he had designed the modern zipper. The rights to this invention were owned by the Meadville company (operating as the Hookless Fastener Co.), but Sundback retained non-U.S. rights and used these to set up in subsequent years the Canadian firm Lightning <b>Fastner</b> Co. in St. Catharines, Ont. Sundback's work with this firm has led to the common misperception that he was Canadian and that the zipper originated in that country.|$|E
40|$|Practically every {{engineering}} {{product with}} {{any degree of}} complexity uses threaded fasteners. Although threaded fasteners are generally considered a mature technology, significant problems exist with their use. This study has investigated a number of issues with the tightening and self-loosening of threaded fasteners. - It was found that upon repeated tightening of electro-zinc plated fastners significant wear of the contact surfaces of the bolt/nut thread and nut face occured. This wear was accompanied by an increase in the friction coefficient causing a reduction in the clamp force provided for an assembly when tightened to a specific torque value. - The self-loosening characteristics of prevailing torque nuts were also investigated. It was found that there was a significant loss of prevailing torque when a <b>fastner</b> self-loosened when compared to the prevailing torque when being deliberately disassembled. The current standard test for prevailing torque nuts on re-use does not reflect this surprising result and leads to a significant over-estimate of the capability of this class of nut to resist self-loosening. This is a contribution to knowledge on this topic. - A further major original finding of this study has been that if an axial load is also acting on a joint which is experiencing transverse slip, prevailing torque nuts can continue to self-loosen leading to their possible detachment from bolts. A number of accidents have been caused by such detachments, but the cause was not understood partly because this detachment could not be reproduced on the standard loosening test. Work reported in this thesis has been found that if an external axial load is acting whilst the joint is experiencing transverse slip, under the approprioate conditions, the loosening process will continue until nut detachment occurs. - A series of tests has been completed in which the forces needed to tighten and loosen threaded fastners were measured whilst the joint was being subjected to transverse slip/vibration. Measurements were made of the frictional resistance forces in the circumfrential direction and the loosening torque acting on a <b>fastner</b> under transverse slip conditions. It was found that the loosening torque range varied between two positive limits rather than between zero and an upper limit as anticipated by the theory. It was also found that the friction coefficient in the circumfrential direction in the threads is greated than that on the nut face bearing surface during conditions of transverse slip...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} the FE stress analysis of Aileron-control bracket attachment to front-spar in SARAS composite wing. The wing is having eight aileron control brackets attached to fiont-spar between sta# 4 to sta# 21. During the actuation of the aileron. the force {{is transferred to}} the bracket by metallic tubes which are connected trough bracket. These forces are reacted by the front-spar and front-spar gussets to which the brackets are attached through fasteners. Each bracket {{should be able to}} transfer the actuator load efficiently and it is necessary to ensure the strength and stiffness of the surrounding parts for the smooth operation of the aileron. Brackets and attachment are modeled in detail and the brackets are integrated with global wing model. FE stress analysis is carried out for all three design ultimate load conditions. Failure-index of composite part is extracted on the basis of Yamada-Sun failure criteria. It is found that failure-index of front-spar which is connected with aileron-bracket to front-spar and front-spar gusset, the <b>fastner</b> forces are also extracted. Margin of safety for shear-strenth of fasteners and bearing-stress of CFC and metal connections are also positive...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to suggest {{trousers}} patterns based on an analysis of the dressing motion of persons with motor impairment, while considering ease of dressing and daily life. We analyzed the dressing and undressing of the seven subjects (four cerebral palsy patients, two spina bifida patients, and one spinal cord injury patient) with an occupational therapist. As a result, it was difficult for persons with motor impairment to pull the trousers up over the hips, and it was clarified that the posture at that time was different according to the degree of lower limb disorder. Most of the persons with motor impairment attached great importance to dressing/undressing and trousers that do not use a <b>fastner,</b> and wore trousers that use elastic cord sewn into the waist instead of a waist belt. However, persons who spent most of the day in a wheelchair did not like the elastic cord, in which the lower back appears immediately. Furthermore, they were dissatisfied with the trousers when they crawled around in rooms and corridors without using the wheelchair for movement, because these trousers would slide down below the waist. Therefore, among a group (n= 4) of persons whose posture for lifting the waist of the trousers is to have both knees touching the floor, we adapted the patterns of the trousers with the waist belt in accordance with the following three conditions. 1. The muscular strength of the arms is weak. 2. Lower extremity orthoses are being used in daily life. 3. It was possible for the person to dress himself or herself with the lower extremity orthoses attached. As a result of making trial products and wearing them, improvement in the putting on and taking off of the trousers was accepted. 筆者は、車椅子使用者を対象に、着脱時の生理的負担が少なく、着用時のシルエットが美しい、座位姿勢に適したズボンのパターン設計をめざしている．これまで多くの障害者の方に会い、ズボンの着脱動作の分析を通して着脱動作を改善する修正方法を検討してきた．本論文では現在までに得られた知見の中から、 3 つの修正方法を事例研究として報告する...|$|E
40|$|It {{seems very}} pretty, but it’s rather hard to understand! Somehow {{it seems to}} fill my head with ideas — only I don’t exactly know what they are! ” These are the {{comments}} of Alice on the poem Jabberwocky in the book Through the Looking Glass written by Lewis Carroll.

It is still unclear whether sex differences may influence long-term prognosis of TTC patients. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether sex differences do influence the short- and long-term outcomes of TTC. Methods and results: A total of 114 patients with TTC were admitted to the University Medical Centre Mannheim from January 2003 to September 2015 and entered into the TTC database of the University Medical Centre Mannheim, and retrospectively analyzed. Patients were diagnosed by the Mayo Clinic criteria. All-cause mortality over mean follow-up of 1, 529 ± 1, 121  days was revealed. Significantly more male patients died within long-term follow-up compared to female TTC patients (log-rank test; P= 0. 01). Most males died of noncardiac causes. In multivariate Cox regression analysis, the male sex (P= 0. 02, hazard ratio [HR] 2. 8, 95 % CI 1. 1 – 7. 2), the ejection fraction ≤ 35 % (P= 0. 01, HR 3. 3, 95 % CI 1. 2 – 9. 2) and glomerular filtration rate < 60  mL/min (P< 0. 01, HR 3. 1, 95 % CI 1. 4 – 7. 0) figured out as independent predictors of the adverse outcome. Conclusion: This study shows that males suffering from TTC reveal a higher long-term all-cause mortality rate than females over a 5 year follow-up period.

Most {{of the studies}} investigating the effects of atherosclerosis focused on early atherosclerotic lesions, whereas lesions in human disease, {{at the time when}} medical treatment is started, are already well established. Therefore, we set up a model of advanced atherosclerosis and investigated the effects of olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine besylate, and the combination of both on atherosclerotic lesion size and lesion composition. Materials and methods: Olmesartan medoxomil (1 mg/kg/day), amlodipine besylate (1. 5 mg/kg/day), and the combination of both was added to chow and was fed to apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-/-) mice at 25 weeks of age. Mice were sacrificed after 25 weeks of drug administration and perfused with formalin. Innominate arteries were dissected out and paraffin embedded. Serial sections were generated, and lesion sizes and their composition – such as minimal thickness of the fibrous cap, size of the necrotic core, and presence of calcification – were analyzed. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were used to detect DNA-binding activity of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) in aortic tissue. Results: Treatment with the combination of olmesartan medoxomil and amlodipine besylate led to a significant reduction in atherosclerotic lesion size in ApoE-/- mice (olmesartan medoxomil/amlodipine besylate: 122, 277 ± 6, 795 µm 2, number [n]= 14; versus control: 177, 502 ± 10, 814 µm 2, n= 9; P< 0. 001). Treatment with amlodipine besylate (n= 5) alone did not reach significance. However, a trend toward a decrease in lesion size in the amlodipine besylate-treated animals could be observed. In the histological analysis of atherosclerotic lesion composition, significantly thicker fibrous caps were found in treatment with amlodipine besylate (amlodipine: 5. 12 ± 0. 26 µm, n= 6; versus control: 3. 98 ± 0. 18 µm, n= 10; P< 0. 01). Furthermore, all sections revealed morphological signs of calcification, but no difference could be detected. Treatment with the combination of olmesartan medoxomil and amlodipine besylate showed no effect on lesion composition. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays of nuclear extracts demonstrated reduced activity of the transcription factor NF-κB when treated with olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine besylate, or their combination, as compared to controls. Conclusion: Combined treatment with olmesartan medoxomil and amlodipine besylate attenuated atherosclerotic lesion progression, possibly due to anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Our data support the hypothesis that even in advanced atherosclerosis anti-inflammatory treatment, using angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers and calcium channel antagonists of the dihydropyridine type can attenuate atherosclerotic lesion progression.
