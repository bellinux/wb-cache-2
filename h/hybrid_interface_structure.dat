40|$|In this dissertation, I {{present the}} results of my {{research}} regarding <b>hybrid</b> semiconductor <b>interfaces</b> between organic and inorganic semiconductors. Using photoemission spectroscopy, I elucidate {{the important role of}} defect-induced electronic states within the inorganic semiconductor phase. These states significantly affect both the energy level alignment and the charge carrier dynamics at the <b>hybrid</b> <b>interface.</b> I demonstrate that the behavior of these <b>hybrid</b> semiconductor <b>interfaces</b> is complex and not well characterized by current models for organic semiconductor interfaces. Specifically, I show that <b>hybrid</b> <b>interfaces</b> host unique electronic phenomena that depend sensitively on the surface structure of the inorganic semiconductor. I also demonstrate new applications of photoemission spectroscopies that enable the direct analysis of important properties of inorganic semiconductors, including charge carrier behavior near <b>hybrid</b> <b>interfaces</b> and the electronic character of defect-induced energy levels. The research presented here focuses on two different n-type inorganic semiconductors, tin disulfide (SnS₂) and zinc oxide (ZnO). SnS₂ is a layered transition metal dichalcogenide that presents an atomically flat and inert surface, ideal for sensitively probing electronic interactions at the <b>hybrid</b> <b>interface.</b> To probe the electronic structure of the SnS₂ surface, I used a variety of organic molecules, including copper phthalocyanine, vanadyl naphthalocyanine, chloro-boron subphthalocyanine, and C₆₀. ZnO has a complex surface structure that can be modified by simple experimental procedures; it was therefore used as a tunable semiconductor substrate where the effects of altered electronic structure can be observed. By carefully studying the origin of hybrid interfacial interactions, these research projects provide a first step in explicitly elucidating the fundamental mechanisms that determine the electronic properties of <b>hybrid</b> <b>interfaces...</b>|$|R

40|$|Molecular spintronics, a {{field that}} {{utilizes}} the spin state of organic molecules to develop magneto-electronic devices, has shown an enormous scientific activity {{for more than a}} decade. But, {{in the last couple of}} years, new insights in understanding the fundamental phenomena of molecular interaction on magnetic surfaces, forming a <b>hybrid</b> <b>interface,</b> are presenting a new pathway for developing the subfield of interface-assisted molecular spintronics. The recent exploration of such <b>hybrid</b> <b>interfaces</b> involving carbon based aromatic molecules shows a significant excitement and promise over the previously studied single molecular magnets. In the above new scenario, hybridization of the molecular orbitals with the spin-polarized bands of the surface creates new interface states with unique electronic and magnetic character.

Spin-polarized scanning tunneling spectroscopy is favorably considered to be an important tool to investigate these <b>hybrid</b> <b>interfaces</b> with intra-molecular spatial resolution.

40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} needs for lightweight and multifunctional materials and structures that can perform in extreme environment such as high temperature and pressure, hybrid composite laminates that are comprised of both metallic and polymeric constituents are under development. Because of the mismatch in properties of different layers in these hybrid laminates, the interfacial regions between polymer and metal are critical for durability and reliability. The objective of this work {{is to develop a}} robust and multifunctional interface between metallic foils and carbon fabric reinforced polymer matrix composite (PMC) for hybrid materials that can maintain mechanical properties at high temperature temperature, i. e. up to 200 - 300 ?C. The major focus of this Ph. D. dissertation is the fabrication and characterization of the high temperature <b>hybrid</b> <b>interface</b> between Ti/NiTi with high temperature thermosetting polymer matrix composites. Approaches derived from experimental techniques for manufacturing and characterizing are utilized. In particular, the highlight of this work is the employment of the novel laser ablation method in combination with a custom-synthesized sol-gel treatment technique to prepare the surfaces of metallic foils for strong adhesion with the polymer matrix composites. The mode I and mode II fracture toughness of the <b>hybrid</b> <b>interfaces</b> is characterized at various temperatures up to the glass transition temperature onset of the polymer matrix. To achieve this, the double cantilever beam (DCB) and four-point end notch flexure (4 - ENF) tests were performed. In-situ distributed strain measurements using Rayleigh back-scattered fiber optics and digital image correlation (DIC) are carried out during the fracture toughness tests at both room and elevated temperatures. Extensive characterization of the <b>hybrid</b> <b>interface</b> cross-section is performed using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy/nano-infrared spectra analysis. Other thermal-mechanical characterization methods employed in this work include dynamic mechanical analysis, thermomechanical analyzer, differential scanning calorimetry, and thermal gravimetric analysis. Finite element analyses (FEA) are conducted in parallel with experiments to provide assistance to understanding the fracture behavior of the <b>hybrid</b> metal-composite <b>interfaces.</b> The virtual crack closure technique with mixed-mode fracture criterions is used to model crack propagation in double cantilever beams. The influence of thermal residual stress due to curing on the crack growth at the <b>hybrid</b> <b>interface</b> is investigated. The effect of laser ablated pattern on the fracture behavior of the <b>hybrid</b> <b>interfaces</b> is studied via the extended finite element method (XFEM) ...|$|R

For the front side electrode, Zn Phthalocyaninetetraphosphonic acid Zn PTPA and Sn phthalocyanine axially substituted with tartaric acid Sn PTA have been used for the surface termination of ITO coated glass substrates.

For the back side electrode we report on the formation of buffer free charge carrier selective Mg Ag cathodes, which are applied for bulk heterojunction organic absorbers consisting of copper phthalocyanine CuPc donor and fullerene C 60 acceptor materials.
