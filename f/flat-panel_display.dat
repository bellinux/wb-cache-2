25|$|WMS {{continued}} to produce video gaming machines and, {{to a smaller}} extent, reel-spinning slots, for sale and for lease to casinos in the U.S., selected foreign markets and state lotteries. Some of WMS's product designs reflected the changing demographics of its industry. Younger players raised on video games often seek more challenging experiences, both physical and mental, than do women age 55 to 65 – the traditional audience for slot machines. Accordingly, some of the company's machines incorporate surround sound, <b>flat-panel</b> <b>display</b> screens and animated, full-color images.|$|E
25|$|A {{liquid-crystal display}} (LCD) is a <b>flat-panel</b> <b>display</b> or other {{electronically}} modulated optical device {{that uses the}} light-modulating properties of liquid crystals. Liquid crystals do not emit light directly, instead using a backlight or reflector to produce images in colour or monochrome. LCDs are available to display arbitrary images (as in a general-purpose computer display) or fixed images with low information content, which can be displayed or hidden, such as preset words, digits, and 7-segment displays, as in a digital clock. They use the same basic technology, except that arbitrary images {{are made up of}} a large number of small pixels, while other displays have larger elements.|$|E
2500|$|Normally, the {{software}} {{in a computer}} treats the computer’s display screen as a rectangular array of square, indivisible pixels, {{each of which has}} an intensity and color that are determined by the blending of three primary colors: red, green, and blue. However, actual display hardware usually implements each pixel as a group of three adjacent, independent subpixels, each of which displays a different primary color. Thus, on a real computer display, each pixel is actually composed of separate red, green, and blue subpixels. For example, if a <b>flat-panel</b> <b>display</b> is examined under a magnifying glass, the pixels may appear as follows: ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Flat-panel</b> <b>displays</b> are {{electronic}} viewing technologies used {{to enable}} people to see content (still images, moving images, text, or other visual material) {{in a range of}} entertainment, consumer electronics, personal computer, and mobile devices, and many types of medical, transportation and industrial equipment. They are far lighter and thinner than traditional cathode ray tube (CRT) television sets and video displays and are usually less than 10 cm thick. <b>Flat-panel</b> <b>displays</b> can be divided into two display device categories: volatile and static. Volatile displays require that pixels be periodically electronically refreshed to retain their state (e.g., liquid-crystal displays (LCD)). A volatile display only shows an image when it has battery or AC mains power. Static <b>flat-panel</b> <b>displays</b> rely on materials whose color states are bistable (e.g., e-book reader tablets from Sony), and as such, <b>flat-panel</b> <b>displays</b> retain the text or images on the screen even when the power is off. As of 2016, <b>flat-panel</b> <b>displays</b> have almost completely replaced old CRT displays. In many 2010-era applications, specifically small portable devices such as laptops, mobile phones, smartphones, digital cameras, camcorders, point-and-shoot cameras, and pocket video cameras, any <b>display</b> disadvantages of <b>flat-panels</b> (as compared with CRTs) are made up for by portability advantages (thinness and lightweightness).|$|R

50|$|Static <b>flat-panel</b> <b>displays</b> rely on {{materials}} whose color {{states are}} bistable. This {{means that the}} image they hold requires no energy to maintain, but instead requires energy to change. This results {{in a much more}} energy-efficient display, but with a tendency towards slow refresh rates which are undesirable in an interactive <b>display.</b> Bistable <b>flat-panel</b> <b>displays</b> are beginning deployment in limited applications (Cholesteric displays, manufactured by Magink, in outdoor advertising; electrophoretic displays in e-book reader devices from Sony and iRex; anlabels).|$|R

25|$|By {{the late}} 2000s, CRT display {{technology}} was largely supplanted worldwide by <b>flat-panel</b> <b>displays</b> such as LCD. Flat-panel television, especially LCD, {{has become the}} dominant form of television since the early 2010s.|$|R
50|$|Currently, the macroelectronics {{industry}} is dramatically {{growing in the}} similar way as the microelectronics was in early ’90s. The most visible example of macroelectronics at present is <b>flat-panel</b> <b>displays,</b> which have been rapidly replacing cathode-ray tubes as the monitors of choice for computers and televisions since 2000. The <b>flat-panel</b> <b>displays</b> have enabled applications unimaginable for cathode-ray tubes. For example, the Dolphins Stadium in Miami will soon have the world's largest high definition video display, about 15 m high and 42 m wide, comprising more than 4.6 million light-emitting diodes, showing image of more than 1.5 million pixels.|$|R
50|$|Most 2010s-era <b>flat-panel</b> <b>displays</b> use LCD and/or LED technologies. Most LCD screens are {{back-lit}} to {{make them}} easier to read or view in bright environments. <b>Flat-panel</b> <b>displays</b> are thin and lightweight and provide better linearity and {{they are capable of}} higher resolution than typical consumer-grade TVs from earlier eras. The highest resolution for consumer-grade CRT TVs was 1080i; in contrast, many <b>flat-panels</b> can <b>display</b> 1080p or even 4K resolution. As of 2016, some devices that use flat-panels, such as tablet computers, smartphones and, less commonly, laptops, use touchscreens, a feature that enables users to select onscreen icons or trigger actions (e.g., playing a digital video) by touching the screen. Many touchscreen-enabled devices can display a virtual QWERTY or numeric keyboard on the screen, to enable the user to type words or numbers.|$|R

50|$|With high {{lead content}} in CRTs and the rapid {{diffusion}} of new <b>flat-panel</b> <b>display</b> technologies, {{some of which}} (LCDs) use lamps which contain mercury, there is growing concern about electronic waste from discarded televisions. Related occupational health concerns exist, as well, for disassemblers removing copper wiring and other materials from CRTs. Further environmental concerns related to television design and use relate to the devices' increasing electrical energy requirements.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to his pioneer research on the OLED and OPV, Tang {{made a number of}} critical innovations resulting in the commercialization of a new <b>flat-panel</b> <b>display</b> technology. These innovations include [...] "the development of robust transport and luminescent materials, improved device architectures, novel color pixilation methods, and fabrication processes for the manufacture of passive-matrix OLED displays; and the adaptation of active-matrix backplane technology for high-definition OLED displays".|$|E
50|$|Motion {{interpolation}} is a common, {{optional feature}} of various modern display {{devices such as}} HDTVs and video players, aimed at increasing perceived framerate and/or alleviating display motion blur, a common problem on LCD <b>flat-panel</b> <b>displays.</b>|$|R

50|$|Because {{of these}} annoyances, AV-sync error {{is a concern}} to the {{television}} programming industry, including television stations, networks, advertisers and program production companies. Unfortunately, the advent of high-definition <b>flat-panel</b> <b>display</b> technologies (LCD, DLP and plasma), which can delay video more than audio, has moved the problem into the viewer's home and beyond control of the television programming industry alone. Consumer product companies now offer audio-delay adjustments to compensate for video-delay changes in TVs and A/V receivers, and several companies manufacture dedicated digital audio delays made exclusively for lip-sync error correction.|$|E

5000|$|Indium gallium {{zinc oxide}} (IGZO) is a {{semiconducting}} material, consisting of indium (In), gallium (Ga), zinc (Zn) and oxygen (O). IGZO thin-film transistor (TFT) {{is used in}} the TFT backplane of <b>flat-panel</b> <b>displays</b> (FPDs). IGZO-TFT was developed by Hideo Hosono's group at Tokyo Institute of Technology and Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) in 2003 (crystalline IGZO-TFT) and in 2004 (amorphous IGZO-TFT). [...] IGZO-TFT has 20-50 times the electron mobility of amorphous silicon, which has often been used in liquid-crystal displays (LCDs) and e-papers. As a result, IGZO-TFT can improve the speed, resolution and size of <b>flat-panel</b> <b>displays.</b> It is thus considered {{to be one of the}} most promising thin-film transistors for use in organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays.|$|R
