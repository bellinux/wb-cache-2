30|$|As {{concluded}} by Grassie [20], wear is a main {{material damage}} mechanism of rail corrugation. Most {{of the above}} investigations on rail corrugation were focused on the wavelength fixing mechanism. Research [1, 21, 22] shows that the wavelength fixing mechanism includes the P 2 resonance of the interaction <b>between</b> <b>wheel</b> and rail, the pinned–pinned resonance of tracks, the second torsional resonance of driven axles, and the transient dynamic interaction <b>between</b> <b>wheel</b> and rail due to initial rail surface roughness. Among these proposed mechanisms, the transient dynamic interaction <b>between</b> <b>wheel</b> and rail is widely accepted. Now, most simulation works on rail corrugation are all based on this mechanism.|$|R
25|$|This {{computation}} {{using the}} induced EMF method {{is identical to}} the computation of the mutual <b>impedance</b> <b>between</b> two dipoles (with infinitesimal conductor radius) separated by the distance a. Because the field at or beyond the edge of an antenna's cylindrical conductor at a distance a is only dependent on the current distribution along the conductor, and not the radius of the conductor, that field is used to compute the mutual <b>impedance</b> <b>between</b> that filamentary antenna and the actual position of the conductor with a radius a. This then supplies the self-impedance of the conductor itself.|$|R

50|$|One {{may also}} {{start with an}} {{infinite}} number of separate one-loop circuits. One may think of each loop as a potential well, and the current flow as a particle of sorts. Since the loops are not connected, none of the particles know about each other. There is infinite <b>impedance</b> <b>between</b> the current loops. Now if one lowers the <b>impedance</b> <b>between</b> them, then they are affected a little; and if one lowers the impedance even more, then they affected even more. At this point the potential well becomes a complicated surface with many particles bumping into each other.|$|R
40|$|The article {{deals with}} the problem of {{trailing}} weight distribution <b>between</b> <b>wheel</b> drivers and the tangent traction creating in the each gear’s contact zone to the supporting surface in full compliance with the wheel gear’s trailing weight. Exposed is a constructive solution of portable traction augmenter with the weight distribution and corresponding auxiliary traction distribution <b>between</b> <b>wheel</b> drivers. The research aim consisted in designing a portable traction augmenter maintaining the weight distribution <b>between</b> <b>wheel</b> drivers. The researched problem relates to revealing the relation <b>between</b> the <b>wheel</b> drivers’ trailing weight distribution and the tangential traction arising when these wheel drivers are rolling along the supporting surface. The considered questions can be used for wheel drivers’ optimal loading with tangential traction and consecutive efficiency improving. The obtained structural design solutions for a portable traction augmenter with distributed weight moving along the supporting surface on pneumatic tires, when tire deformation work takes place opposing to the resistance force can be used to calculate wheel drivers’ quality factors...|$|R
30|$|We purposefully {{designed}} the navigation {{portion of the}} task to be fairly easy because we wanted all participants to progress far {{enough to be able}} to have time to focus on the creation of their strategies. Furthermore, the outcome variable of interest was not whether participants could successfully navigate through the maze, but whether their solution strategy could be generalized. To create a generalizable strategy, participants must have uncovered the simple proportional relationship <b>between</b> <b>wheel</b> size and distance per motor rotation, and <b>between</b> <b>wheel</b> size and angle turned per motor rotation. Participants could conceptualize these relationships in absolute/functional terms (by reasoning about the multipliers <b>between</b> <b>wheel</b> diameter and centimeters per motor rotation or angle per motor rotation) or in relative/scaling terms (by reasoning about the scaling constants between the tested robots and other robots).|$|R

Measured differences in <b>impedance</b> <b>between</b> the two coils are used to detect flaws in the wall of the tube. Physically what happens is alternating currents in the coils generate eddy currents in the wall of the tube. The magnetic field (primarily the axial component) from the eddy currents reduces the inductance of the coils from the free space values. A flaw will alter the eddy currents, resulting in a local change in magnetic field within the tube and hence a difference in <b>impedance</b> <b>between</b> the two coils...|$|R

40|$|Conventional {{distance}} protection applies the {{positive sequence impedance}} to protect a line against short-circuit faults. Series-compensated lines may considerably change the positive sequence impedance of the fault path and cause the distance relays to maloperate.

50|$|The figure shows two {{versions}} of a simple low-pass filter, unbalanced version (A) and balanced version (B). Both circuits have exactly the same effect as filters, {{they have the same}} transfer function. However, on the unbalanced circuit, the bottom pole of the input port is connected directly to the bottom pole of the output port. Thus, the <b>impedance</b> <b>between</b> the top poles is greater than the <b>impedance</b> <b>between</b> the bottom poles from input to output. For a circuit to be balanced the impedance of the top leg must be the same as the impedance of the bottom leg so that the transmission paths are identical. To achieve this, the inductor in the balanced version is split into two equal inductors, each with half the original inductance.|$|R
