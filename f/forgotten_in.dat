40|$|Forgetting is {{a useful}} tool for {{tailoring}} ontologies by reducing the number of concepts and roles, while preserving sound and complete reasoning. Some {{attempts have been made to}} address the problem of <b>forgetting</b> <b>in</b> some relatively simple description logics (DLs) such as DL-Lite and extended EL. Ontologies in those works are mostly expressed as TBoxes rather than general knowledge bases (KBs). However, the issue of forgetting for general KBs in more expressive ontology languages, such as ALC and OWL DL, is largely unexplored. In particular, the problem of characterizing and computing forgetting is still open. In this paper, we first define semantic forgetting about concepts and roles in ALC ontologies and show several important properties of <b>forgetting</b> <b>in</b> this setting. Unlike the case of DL-Lite, the result of <b>forgetting</b> <b>in</b> an ALC ontology may not exist in general, which makes the problem of how to compute <b>forgetting</b> <b>in</b> ALC more challenging. As a result, we tackle the non-existence of the result of <b>forgetting</b> <b>in</b> ALC ontologies by first investigating <b>forgetting</b> <b>in</b> concept descriptions and then defining and studying a series of approximations to the result of <b>forgetting</b> <b>in</b> ALC ontologies. We show that <b>forgetting</b> <b>in</b> ALC ontologies can be approximated through computing forgetting for concept descriptions. Our algorithms can be embedded into an ontology editor to enhance its ability to manage and apply (large) ontologies.

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of term {{elimination}} in DL-Lite ontologies by adopting techniques from classical forgetting theory. Specifically, we generalize our previous results on <b>forgetting</b> <b>in</b> DL-Lite_core TBox to <b>forgetting</b> <b>in</b> DL-Lite_bool KBs. We also introduce query-based forgetting, a parameterized definition of forgetting, which provides a unifying framework for defining and comparing different definitions of <b>forgetting</b> <b>in</b> DL-Lite ontologies.

5|$|Although Adams has {{experimented with}} {{painting}} with watercolor and oil paints (his 1989 covers for Appleseed were rendered {{with a combination}} of ink, watercolor and color pencil), his color work is so sporadic that he says he has to relearn what he has <b>forgotten</b> <b>in</b> the interim each time, and is usually dissatisfied with the results. Because a significant portion of his income is derived from selling his original artwork, he is reluctant to learn how to produce his work digitally.|$|E
5|$|Different {{estimates}} exist of {{the amounts}} of indium contained within the ores of other metals. However, these amounts are not extractable without mining of the host materials (see Production and availability). Thus, the availability of indium is fundamentally determined by {{the rate at which}} these ores are extracted, and not their absolute amount. This is an aspect that is often <b>forgotten</b> <b>in</b> the current debate, e.g. by the Graedel group at Yale in their criticality assessments, explaining the paradoxically low depletion times some studies cite.|$|E

40|$|The {{governor}} {{architecture is}} a new method for avoiding catatrophic <b>forgetting</b> <b>in</b> neural networks that is particularly useful in online robot learning. The governor architecture uses a categorizer to identify events and excise long sequences of repetitive data that cause catastrophic <b>forgetting</b> <b>in</b> neural networks trained on robot-based tasks. We examine the performance of several variations of the governor architecture {{on a number of}} related localization tasks using a simulated robot. The results show that governed networks perform far better than ungoverned networks.

40|$|Abstract. A novel {{declarative}} {{approach of}} <b>forgetting</b> <b>in</b> answer set programming (ASP) {{has been proposed}} recently. In this paper we report a system prototype of <b>forgetting</b> <b>in</b> ASP, called LPForget. It consists of two modules: (1) Forgetting: computing the result of forgetting about certain literals in logic program under the answer set semantics; (2) CRS: application of <b>forgetting</b> <b>in</b> resolving conflict (or preference recovery) in multi-agent systems. The motivation for developing LPForget is to provide reasoning support for managing ontologies in rule-based ontology language as well as using the system for studying theoretic properties of forgetting.

5|$|Barbauld's {{career as}} a poet ended {{abruptly}} in 1812 {{with the publication of}} Eighteen Hundred and Eleven, which criticised Britain's participation in the Napoleonic Wars. She was shocked by the vicious reviews it received and published nothing else in her lifetime. Her reputation was further damaged when many of the Romantic poets she had inspired in the heyday of the French Revolution turned against her in their later, more conservative years. Barbauld was remembered only as a pedantic children's writer in the nineteenth century, and largely <b>forgotten</b> <b>in</b> the twentieth, but the rise of feminist literary criticism in the 1980s renewed interest in her works and restored her place in literary history.|$|E
5|$|Barely {{five years}} after {{upgrades}} were completed in 1888, it was suggested the fort be demolished. Debates over the fort lingered on between the Colonial Defence Committee in London, and the Local Defence Committee in Singapore for nearly a decade. The fort was finally rendered obsolete and abandoned in 1901 when the guns were removed. Instead of destroying the fort, the British thought it simpler to bury it, which was done sometime after World War I. A portion of a bastion was still visible above ground well into the 1960s, when a public park was built atop the fort for the fast-growing Katong suburbs. In the late 1960s, the bastion was finally buried when land reclamation in the East Coast took place, and its memory was soon <b>forgotten</b> <b>in</b> the ensuing decades.|$|E

5|$|Existing {{negative}} {{views about}} Peribsen's existence {{are based on}} Ramesside king lists, such as the Abydos King List, the Saqqara King List and the Royal Canon of Turin, which all omit Peribsen's name. These, however, {{are known to have}} been redacted nearly 1,500 years after his death and several 4th dynasty tombs of priests performing the funerary cult for Peribsen have been uncovered. These tombs report Peribsen's name correctly and their existence demonstrate that Peribsen was seen as a legitimate pharaoh, not subject to damnatio memoriae as Akhenaten later would be. Historians and Egyptologists therefore consider the possibility that Peribsen's name was actually <b>forgotten</b> <b>in</b> time or that his name was preserved in a distorted, misspelled form.|$|E

The jaw fragments which had been recovered in May 1945 were not tested.|$|E

The book continued to be cited, but then starting in the 1960s the original thesis by Bachelier began to be cited more than his book when economists started citing Bachelier's work.|$|E
