40|$|We {{discuss a}} simple {{transformation}} that allows to generate SU(3) structure solutions of Type IIB supergravity with RR fluxes, starting from non-Kähler solutions of Type I supergravity. The method may be applied {{also in the}} presence of supersymmetric source branes. We apply this transformation to a solution describing fivebranes wrapped on the S 2 of the resolved conifold with additional <b>flavour</b> fivebrane <b>sources.</b> The resulting solution is a generalisation of the resolved deformed conifold solution of Butti et al [1] by the addition of D 5 brane and D 3 brane sources. We propose that this solution may be interpreted in terms of a combined effect of Higgsing and cascade of Seiberg dualities in the dual field theory...|$|R
40|$|We reappraise the flavour {{changing}} neutral currents (FCNC) {{problem in}} string [...] derived supergravity models. We overview and classify possible <b>sources</b> of <b>flavour</b> violation {{and find that}} the problem often does not arise in classes of models which generate hierarchical Yukawa matrices. In such models, constraints from the K- and D-meson systems leave room for substantial flavour non-universality of the soft terms. The current B-physics experiments only begin to probe its natural range. Correlations among different observables can allow one to read off the chirality structure of <b>flavour</b> violating <b>sources.</b> We briefly discuss the lepton sector where the problem of FCNC is indeed serious and perhaps points at an additional symmetry or flavour universality.

40|$|Microorganisms are {{regularly}} associated with food spoilage and dangerous diseases; thus, not only food scientists {{are afraid of}} them. However, numerous bacteria and fungi {{are essential to the}} empirical food biotechnologies (alcoholic, lactic, mixed fermentations); they form and transform, along efficient and selective enzymatically catalysed pathways, a variety of volatile flavours specific of the respective foods. Potent flavour forming microorganisms were selected in recent years, and concerted bioprocesses for the production of natural flavours were developed. Bioengineering provides technical aids to improve the yields, such as membrane aided and two-phase processes, fed-batch procedures, gas phase feeding, and efficient in-situ removal (ISRP) to avoid inhibitory product concentrations. Novel instruments from the toolbox of biochemistry and molecular biology, such as accelerated sequencing will help to establish “white biotechnology ” as a viable and sustainable alternative for <b>flavour</b> production. <b>Sources</b> and quality of flavour...|$|R
40|$|We study {{spectral}} {{distortions of}} diffuse ultra-high energy (UHE) neutrino flavour fluxes resulting due to physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). Even large spectral differences between <b>flavours</b> at the <b>source</b> are massaged into a common shape at earth by SM oscillations, thus, any significant observed spectral differences are {{an indicator of}} new physics present in the oscillation probability during propagation. Neutrino decay and Lorentz symmetry violation (LV) are examples, and result in significant distortion of the fluxes and the well-known bounds on them, which may allow UHE detectors to probe lifetimes, the mass hierarchy and LV parameters over a broad range.

40|$|Essential oils are volatile, {{fragrant}} oils {{that occur}} in plants and in general contribute to their characteristic odors, flavors, or other properties. Studies have revealed {{that there is a}} spectrum of essential oils present in Zingibereaceae species, which are used widely as spice, <b>flavouring</b> and medicinal <b>sources.</b> The focus of current research was given to a wild species named as sp. 4 from the genus Etlingera whose most species are still in undeveloped stage. The extraction of essential oil from the rhizome material of Etlingera sp. 4 was conducted by hydro-distillation process using an all glass Clevenger-type apparatus. The compositions of essential oil isolated were further analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. In addition, the effects of storage conditions including exposure to heat and light on the quality of essential oil were observed for 3 weeks. The changes in the compositions of essential oil were monitored by comparing the area of peaks. Based on the quantitative analysis of the GC-MS results, it was discovered that extreme storage conditions will result in the loss of certain volatile oil components in essential oils. Thus, optimum storage condition must be applied on natural essential oil to preserve its freshness and potency...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine how}} light neutrinos coming from distant active galactic nuclei (AGN) and similar high energy sources {{may be used}} as tools to probe {{non-standard}} physics. In particular we discuss how studying the energy spectra of each neutrino flavour coming from such distant sources and their distortion relative to each other may serve as pointers to exotic physics such as neutrino decay, Lorentz symmetry violation, pseudo-Dirac effects, CP and CPT violation and quantum decoherence. This allows us to probe hitherto unexplored ranges of parameters for the above cases, for example lifetimes in the range $ 10 ^{- 3 }- 10 ^{ 4 } $ s/eV for the case of neutrino decay. We show that standard neutrino oscillations ensure that the different flavours arrive at the earth with similar shapes even if their <b>flavour</b> spectra at <b>source</b> may differ strongly in both shape and magnitude. As a result, observed differences between the spectra of various flavours at the detector would be signatures of non-standard physics altering neutrino fluxes during propagation rather than those arising during their production at source. Since detection of ultra-high energy (UHE) neutrinos is perhaps imminent, it is possible that such differences in spectral shapes will be tested in neutrino detectors in the near future. To that end, using the IceCube detector as an example, we show how our results translate to observable shower and muon-track event rates. Comment: 16 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
40|$|We present Suzaku {{observations}} of five hard X-ray selected nearby Seyfert 2 galaxies. All the sources were clearly detected with the pin Hard X-ray Detector {{up to several}} tens of keV, allowing for a fairly good characterization of the broad-band X-ray continuum. We find that a unique model, even including multiple components, fails to represent the spectra of all the sources. Heavy obscuration manifests itself in different <b>flavours.</b> For two <b>sources</b> there is evidence for a reflection dominated continuum; among the other three, one is "mildly" Compton thick (N_H ~ 10 ^ 24 cm- 2), while the remaining two are heavily obscured (N_H ~ 10 ^ 23. 5 cm- 2), but Compton thin. Strong, narrow, iron Kalpha lines (EW ~ 1 - 2 keV) due to neutral or mildly ionized gas, are detected in Compton thick AGN. In all of them the Kalpha line is accompanied by the Kbeta. The intensity {{and shape of the}} soft X-ray spectrum are different from object to object. Soft X [...] rays may originate from a nuclear component scattered off, or leaking through, the X-ray absorber, plus thermal X-rays from the host galaxy. Emission from circumnuclear gas photoionized by the active nucleus, parameterized with a power law plus individual narrow Gaussian lines, also provides an acceptable description of the soft X-ray spectra. The limited Suzaku XIS CCD energy resolution does not allow us to draw firm conclusions on the origin of the soft X [...] ray emission. We briefly discuss our findings in the light of AGN Unified model and the geometry of the obscuring gas. Comment: 22 pages, 3 Figures; ApJ in pres...|$|R
40|$|Cheddar {{cheese is}} a complex {{microbial}} ecosystem. The internal cheese environment, in particular of hard and semi-hard cheeses, is not conducive {{to the growth of}} many microorganisms. At the beginning of ripening the dominant microorganisms are the starter bacteria which are present at high levels (~ 109 /g). However, during ripening, non-starter lactic acid bacteria (NSLAB) grow from relatively low levels (< 103 /g) at the beginning of ripening, to 108 /g within 6 - 8 weeks. Other bacteria, e. g. enterococci and staphylococci, may also be present but in much lower numbers. In a previous study of mature and extra mature Cheddar cheeses from different manufacturers (see End of Project Report No. 1), {{it was found that the}} NSLAB population was dominated by strains of Lb. paracasei. However, their contribution to cheese <b>flavour</b> and their <b>source(s)</b> are still unclear, nor is it known if the NSLAB flora is unique to each plant. Hence, understanding the growth of this group of organisms in cheese is a key to defining their role in flavour development. The biochemistry of flavour development in cheese is poorly understood. For most cheese varieties, including Cheddar, proteolysis, which results in the accumulation of free amino acids, is of vital importance for flavour development. Increasing evidence suggests that the main contribution of amino acids is as substrates for the development of more complex flavour and aroma compounds. The manner by which such compounds are generated in cheese is currently the focus of much research. Starter bacteria have been shown to contain a range of enzymes capable of facilitating the conversion of amino acids to potential flavour compounds. However, the potential of lactobacilli (NSLAB) to produce similar enzymes has only recently been investigated. Hence, although, it is generally accepted that the cheese starter flora is the primary defining influence on flavour development, the contribution of NSLAB is also considered significant. The objectives of these studies were: - to develop a greater understanding of the behaviour of NSLAB in cheese, and - to identify suitable strains, and other cheese bacteria, to be used as starter adjuncts for flavour improvement.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{critically}} explore {{the relationship between}} authenticity, the individual, society and the food consumed within that society {{for a group of}} residents in Dorset in the United Kingdom.. The authenticity of food impacts on our understandings of the economic, social, political and environmental contexts of food and is worthy of research. As such I focused on my participants’ perceptions of the authenticity of food as something a priori; as it was perceived before other considerations, in ordered to get a primary understanding of the subject. I have positioned myself as a reflexive explorer / researcher who views the world from the position of interpretive constructionism derived from the ideas of postmodernism. I have utilized a qualitative research strategy; phenomenology and more specifically Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). My explanation of the methodology is accompanied by a description of the philosophical underpinning to the work with specific reference to Husserl, Heidegger, Gadamer, Levinas and Derrida. Data were collected using focus groups based around a meal. When I asked my focus group participants about their perspectives {{on the nature of the}} authenticity of food, they described understandings that were vested in four key areas: Family and friends; Saucing: cooking and flavour; Sourcing: where does it come from? and; Interaction with the distinctly other (people that were not friends and family). In terms of the discussion of family and friends, much of this was to do with their experiences of growing up and their relationships with their parents and grandparents. In analysis, ideas such as time, tradition, heritage and gender came to the fore. When looking at saucing, the focus was on the process of cooking and eating, and memories of <b>flavour</b> and aroma. <b>Sourcing</b> highlighted feelings of localness and led to the development of concepts relating to connectedness to those that produce the food and connection to the food itself. There were also concerns as to the provenance of food and feelings of trust and mistrust. Finally, in looking at the distinctly other, as opposed to kith and kin, participants related experiences of trust and vulnerability, authority and independence, and inclusion and exclusion. These ideas informed a discussion on the nature of hospitality in the context of the authenticity of food. In my conclusions I describe how I found my participants’ perceptions of authentic food to be constructed in a place between them as individuals and the Other and changed over time. Perceptions of authenticity were fluid and playful. I also evaluate the work using the criteria of rigour, resonance, reflexivity and relevance, where relevance is split to look at relevance to the academic community and to broader society...|$|R
40|$|Rob Chalmers explains {{the term}} open access, {{and how it}} fits into the wider “open {{movement}}” in The Conversation.. You’ll have read on this site, and perhaps others, about the push towards “open access” for journal articles. But what is open access, {{and how does it}} fit into the wider “open movement”? The topic has been much talked about of late, not least in the context of Open Access Week – a crowd-based movement promoting the push toward open access for journal articles. After decades of paying staff to generate journal content and then having to pay again to access that content, universities appear to have finally woken up. This is one of several different faces of a continuing trend towards an open exchange of information and innovation. So what are those faces, and how do these relate to “old school” or “closed” approaches of developing and exploiting intellectual property? Open Source “Open source” is often seen as the first of the open movements. Emerging out of the Free Software Movement in the 1980 s, open source provides access to the source code of computer software so others can further develop that code. The alternative, “closed” approach, still adopted by many software developers, involves hiding or encrypting a piece of software’s source code to prevent others “reverse engineering” it and creating rival or derivative products. There are many different <b>flavours</b> of open <b>source,</b> with many tricks and traps for those who aren’t aware of the detail of the conditions of access. Understanding what is or isn’t permitted when it comes to editing open-source software requires analysis of the licence terms. Consider the GNU Public Licences, which have different models for software, software used over networks, manuals and a library of exceptions for different purposes. There are more than 70 different open source licences available – some permitting restricted use in educational communities, others being more commercially oriented. All contain different provisions around rights of use, restrictions on downstream works, warranties, indemnities and other matters. Many people don’t bother trying to untangle the differences, and fail to understand what is cost-free, what is in the public domain, and whether they are required to give others access to the source code of works they create. Many benefits have flowed from the use of open-source models of software and hardware development, including the Linux operating system, Arduino electronics, and even key software embodied in nearly every mobile phone (developed by an Australian company Open Kernel Labs – acquired last month by General Dynamics). The open-source model has spilled over into biology and science. One example is molecular biologist Richard Jefferson’s sharing of his discovery of a key genetic tool – the beta-glucuronidase gene – a key indicator of gene activity used in plant genetic engineering. Jefferson gave research labs free access to this tool but also charged for its commercial use. He then invested the proceeds in the foundation of the independent non-profit institute Cambia to further promote open-source initiatives. Open Innovation “Open innovation” is a concept promoted by the author and academic Henry Chesbrough. Unsurprisingly, this approach boils down to the need to engage with other people and their perspectives to develop better products or services. Of course, open innovation has been happening since time immemorial, embraced by companies such as: Siemens, with its attempt to tap the minds of consumers, researchers and external partners to supplement internal innovation Cadbury, with a similar program to embrace innovation partnerships with universities, small to medium enterprises and other multinationals Lilly, with its open innovation drug discovery program. Open data: a patchwork quilt Newer than any of the “open” movements is the push for so-called “open data” – essentially open access to data sets rather than just research publications. There are many different groups working on this from different angles, including: the Open Data Commons, a sort-of copyright-based Creative Commons (all articles on The Conversation are Creative Commons) the Open Data Foundation, directed at enabling access to consistent metadata to inform public policy and decision-making) Open Data Protocol, for querying or updating data that can break down “silos” that prevent sharing between applications. At the moment there are no universally-accepted standards for open data. Too often researchers struggle with clunky paths to access: navigating the shoals of differing access conditions and even having to divert funding into legal resources to map and better articulate the basis on which they share data between themselves (let alone with others). The promise of understanding, innovation, efficiency and effectiveness held out by making use of “Big Data” in the public and private sector will not be fully realised until there is better progress on common standards for open data. And beyond data and data structures {{there needs to be a}} change in culture and mindset – otherwise some predict the promise will turn into a minefield. Crowdsourcing Crowdsourcing of ideas and funding is all the rage: from philanthropic purposes, to start-ups facilitated by the likes of Kickstarter, to multinational companies, which now routinely use crowdsourcing to gather innovation they can’t generate internally. The rise of crowdsourcing raises a number of understandable concerns. There’s potential for scandal: where a crowdsourced project takes money, fails or doesn’t even use it for the project; or exploitation: where those who contribute ideas to a site seeking competitive generation of ideas for a project have their ideas appropriated with no reward. Still, the signals are clear: this style of engagement is growing. Kickstarter is a good example – US$ 350 million has been pledged for more than 30, 000 projects since April 2009, with a rapid escalation this year. A plethora of other crowd-sourcing platforms have emerged with a variety of business models, some for-profit and others not – the educational not-for-profit the Khan Academy is a case in point. Proprietary path “Open” models are often cast in opposition to closed or proprietary models, which are founded on protecting and exploiting intellectual property. But this apparent opposition is an illusion. Many of the open models are actually built on intellectual property rights – it is the way in which those rights are used that differs from proprietary models. Consider “copyleft”, which uses copyright to force others who make derivative works of underlying enabling software platforms to also make their modifications or additions freely available to the benefit of all (and to enable the creation of yet further derivative works). There is nothing new about successful business models that stack proprietary approaches on top of open layers. An open conclusion Individuals can and do choose how open or closed they wish to be in their work. This does not have to be an ideologically fixed and static choice between opposites. A more natural and sophisticated stance is to blend the two approaches to best fit the context. Being open – through social networks, in research or business – is the trend and has much to commend it, but a blend of different approaches gives us a healthy innovation ecosystem.
