50|$|A {{particularly}} noteworthy {{feature in}} CAMeL-View TestRig {{is the way}} in which the descriptive equations for multi-body system models are created. All multi-body simulation formalisms used for code generation create their equations in the form of typical explicit differential equations (ODE). This is especially important in <b>Hardware-in-the-Loop</b> applications where the calculation of simulation results within a specific, defined time frame must be assured. Only then is it possible to implement complex multi-body simulation models for <b>Hardware-in-the-Loop</b> applications under stringent real-time conditions. These constraints cannot be met when using DAE-based methods.|$|E

50|$|<b>Hardware-in-the-loop</b> (HIL) simulation, or HWIL, is a {{technique}} that {{is used in the}} development and test of complex real-time embedded systems. HIL simulation provides an effective platform by adding the complexity of the plant under control to the test platform.
