500|$|The {{album cover}} {{features}} {{a photograph of}} Dylan with Suze Rotolo. It was taken in February 1963—a few weeks after Rotolo had returned from Italy—by CBS staff photographer Don Hunstein {{at the corner of}} Jones Street and West 4th Street in the West Village, New York City, close to the apartment where the couple lived at the time. In 2008, Rotolo described the circumstances surrounding the famous photo to The New York Times: [...] "He wore a very thin jacket, because image was all. Our apartment was always cold, so I had a sweater on, plus I borrowed one of his big, bulky sweaters. On top of that I put on a coat. So I felt like an Italian sausage. Every time <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> picture, I think I look fat." [...] In her memoir, A Freewheelin' Time, Rotolo analyzed the significance of the cover art: ...|$|E
500|$|Robinson protested {{against the}} major leagues' ongoing lack of {{minority}} managers and central office personnel, {{and he turned}} down an invitation to appear in an old-timers' game at Yankee Stadium in 1969. He made his final public appearance on October 15, 1972, throwing the ceremonial first pitch before Game2 of the World Series at Riverfront Stadium in Cincinnati. He gratefully accepted a plaque honoring the twenty-fifth anniversary of his MLB debut, but also commented, [...] "I'm going to be tremendously more pleased and more proud when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> third base coaching line one day and see a black face managing in baseball." [...] This wish was only fulfilled after Robinson's death: following the 1974 season, the Cleveland Indians gave their managerial post to Frank Robinson (no relation to Jackie), a Hall of Fame-bound player who {{would go on to}} manage three other teams. Despite the success of these two Robinsons and other black players, the number of African-American players in Major League Baseball has declined since the 1970s.|$|E
2500|$|Edmunds took special {{delight in}} goading {{southern}} senators into blurting out statements that would embarrass the Democratic Party. [...] To those southerners {{opposed to any}} federal role in protecting blacks' right to vote, Edmunds seemed the epitome of Yankee evil. One southern correspondent in 1880 wrote, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> man sitting almost alone in the Senate, isolated in his gloom of hate and bitterness, stern, silent, watchful, suspicious and pitiless, I am reminded of the worst types of Puritan character... You see the impress of the purer persecuting spirit that burned witches, drove out Roger Williams, hounded Jonathan Edwards for doing his sacred duty, maligned Jefferson, and like a toad squatted at the ear of the Constitution it had failed to pervert." ...|$|E
5000|$|... (…) and one {{day while}} sitting at my typewriter, (…) I wrote—just to write something: The world {{comes to an end}} but {{everybody}} in the SLA is somehow immune. Snake bit them. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> {{for a while and then}} typed: No more gas shortages. That was sort of cheerful, in a horrible sort of way.|$|R
6000|$|I saluted {{and rode}} {{off without a}} word, my heart dancing with joy that such a mission should be mine. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> long, solid line of red and blue looming through the smoke of the guns, and I shook my fist at it as I went. [...] "We shall crush them and not a man escape." ...|$|R
60|$|In my {{agitation}} my foot overset a stone, which rolled noisily {{down the}} rocks. The noise {{attracted the attention}} of the two seated below us. They turned and looked searchingly towards the place where we were concealed. Their faces were in plain sight. As <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> of the woman I felt my heart cease beating and the colour leave my face.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{could find}} it in my heart to arrest thee," [...] said Edward, [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> {{beautiful}} child, and think to what thou wouldst bring her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We have eternity {{to stretch}} our legs in," [...] replied the mystic. [...] "It {{can be an}} {{infinity}} of things. I haven't seen any of them--I've only seen the letter. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>that,</b> and say it's not criminal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I think I have,' and Violet {{pulled off}} her glove. 'There--that forget-me-not--the first ring I ever had. From the day he gave me that it has all been so strange, that now and then I have been almost afraid to awake, for fear {{it should not be}} true. But may <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> diamond {{butterfly}} of yours? It shines as if it would flash in the dark.' ...|$|E
5000|$|There was a {{very good}} {{character}} description of her, so <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> and <b>I</b> kind of built her based on me. I felt that she should be a very strong character with very good convictions, she should be a loyal friend; she should be serious about her work and she wanted to be taken seriously, not just <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> as another pretty face. Renae Jacobs ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] March admitted. [...] "It's {{terrible to}} think how {{unnecessary}} even the best and wisest of us is to the purposes of Providence. When <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> poor young fellow's face sometimes--so gentle and true and pure--I used to think the world was appreciably richer for his being in it. But are we appreciably poorer for his being out of it now?" ...|$|R
60|$|Old Mr. Scott made no answer, {{but still}} sat with wide-open eyes gazing {{from one to}} the other of us. As <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> aged, white-haired man and thought of his mother, who must have died ever so long ago, being the {{daughter}} of the young man who sat opposite to him, it was indeed difficult to believe that these things could be so.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No. Natural genius,' said Mr Dennis. 'No 'prenticing. It come by natur'. Muster Gashford {{knows my}} calling. Look at that hand of mine--many and many {{a job that}} hand has done, with a {{neatness}} and dexterity, never known afore. When <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> hand,' said Mr Dennis, shaking it in the air, 'and remember the helegant bits of work it has turned off, I feel quite molloncholy to think it should ever grow old and feeble. But sich is life!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The fear {{of instant}} death might do much," [...] {{answered}} Pearson; [...] "but when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> sheer depth on either side, {{and at the}} empty chasm between us and yonder turret, which is, I warrant you, twelve feet distant, I confess the truth, nothing short of the most imminent danger should induce me to try. Pah--the thought makes my head grow giddy!--I tremble to see your Highness stand there, balancing yourself as if you meditated a spring into the empty air. I repeat, I would scarce stand so near the verge as does your Highness, for the rescue of my life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This gentleman," [...] {{said the}} old Lord, {{pointing}} to Vivian, [...] "is my son's friend, and I am quite sure that you are all delighted to see him. He arrived here accidentally, his carriage having fortunately broken down in passing one of the streams. All those rivulets should have bridges built over them! I could look at my new bridge for ever. I often ask myself, 'Now, how can such a piece of masonry ever be destroyed?' It seems quite impossible, does not it? We all know that everything has an end; and yet, whenever <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> bridge, I often think that it can only end when all things end." ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{could not}} eat the bread or the meat, nor drink the [...] "slumgullion." [...] And when <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> melancholy vinegar-cruet, <b>I</b> {{thought of the}} anecdote (a very, very old one, even <b>at</b> <b>that</b> day) of the {{traveler}} who sat down to a table which had nothing on it but a mackerel and a pot of mustard. He asked the landlord if this was all. The landlord said: ...|$|R
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> hopeless {{struggle}} my {{eyes met}} {{those of the}} doomed man, and I could have sworn that in his I saw an expression of hopeless appeal. But whether I did or not there swept through me a sudden compassion for the fellow. He was indeed a brother-man, and {{that he might have}} killed me with pleasure had he caught me was forgotten in the extremity of his danger.|$|R
6000|$|... "Open!" [...] he {{answered}} angrily. [...] "What? may <b>I</b> not <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> which <b>I</b> am forced to swallow--I, who am {{the first of}} doctors?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{found one}} at last that Zulime thought I could afford. It {{was a small}} gold band with five opals, {{surrounded}} by several very minute diamonds, all {{of which could be}} had for the sum of thirty-eight dollars. As I bought this ring Zulime's girlish delight in it touched as well as instructed me. Each time she held her finger up for me to see (she had a beautiful hand) I regretted that I had not purchased a better ring. Why did I take a ring at thirty-eight dollars! Why not fifty dollars? But what could be expected of a man who never before had spent so much as one dollar on a piece of jewelry, a man whose chief way of earning money was to save it? Whenever <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> poor little jewel now I experience a curious mingling of shame and regret. I had so little money at that time, and the future was so uncertain! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly. This end, {{which we}} can examine, is frayed. He was cunning enough {{to do that with}} his knife. But the other end is not frayed. You could not observe that from here, but if you were on the mantelpiece you would see that it is cut clean off without any mark of fraying whatever. You can {{reconstruct}} what occurred. The man needed the rope. He would not tear it down for fear of giving the alarm by ringing the bell. What did he do? He sprang up on the mantelpiece, could not quite reach it, put his knee on the bracket--you will see the impression in the dust--and so got his knife to bear upon the cord. I could not reach the place by at least three inches--from which I infer that he is at least three inches a bigger man than <b>I.</b> <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> mark upon the seat of the oaken chair! What is it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{security}} of the British monarchy lies in such a courageous severance of its destinies from the Teutonic dynastic system. Will it make that severance? There I share an almost universal ignorance. The loyalty of the British is not to what kings are too prone to call [...] "my person," [...] not to a chosen and admired family, but to a renascent mankind. We have fought in this war for Belgium, for France, for general freedom, for civilization and the whole future of mankind, far more than for ourselves. We have not fought for a king. We are discovering in that spirit of human unity that lies below {{the idea of a}} League of Free Nations the real invisible king of our heart and race. But we will very gladly go on with our task under a nominal king unless he hampers us in the task that grows ever more plainly before us. ... That, I think, is a fair statement of British public opinion on this question. But every day when I am in London I walk past Buckingham Palace to lunch at my club, and <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> not very expressive façade and wonder--and we all wonder--what thoughts are going on behind it and what acts are being conceived there. Out of it there might yet come some gesture of acceptance magnificent enough to set beside President Wilson's magnificent declaration of war. ...|$|E
50|$|On 13 October 2008, at an inquest {{into the}} death, a police {{surveillance}} officer {{admitted that he}} had deleted a computer record of Cressida Dick's instruction that they could allow Menezes to 'run on to Tube as was not carrying anything.' At the inquest he told the court <b>that</b> 'On reflection, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> and thought <b>I</b> cannot actually say that.' The IPCC announced that it would investigate the matter 'its highest level of investigation'.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, son. <b>I</b> was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> trinket {{which you}} wear. Of course I have noted it before, but never closely. It is strange, very strange!" ...|$|R
60|$|My {{own face}} startled me, it looked so haggard and so wild. Could I present {{myself to a}} stranger, could I hope to produce the {{necessary}} impression in my favor, <b>looking</b> as <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> moment? For all I knew to the contrary, my whole future might depend upon the effect which I produced on Major Fitz-David at first sight. I rang the bell again, and {{sent a message to}} one of the chambermaids to follow me to my room.|$|R
5000|$|... “My eye {{was really}} {{sitting on my}} cheek. Now that I look back at it, every time <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> album cover, it reminds me what not to do. Not {{to take matters into}} my own hands and leave it to God.” - Bushwick Bill to DigBoston, June 19, 2013 ...|$|E
5000|$|The film marked Allen's {{second and}} final film with TriStar Pictures, {{and it was}} speculated in the press that this deal was not {{extended}} because of the filmmaker's personal problems, or that his films were not very profitable. Allen, however, denied these allegations in interviews at the time. As Zach Braff made one scene role as Nick Lipton, the son of Larry and Carol, he said: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> scene now, all I can see is the terror in my eyes".|$|E
5000|$|Magda Cordell {{has said}} that [...] "While Richard, of course, put {{together}} the well-known poster collage for the group (Just {{what is it that}} makes today's homes so different, so appealing?), some of the material in that collage came from John McHale's files, and both Terry Hamilton and I helped gather the images. We often looked for material in the studio John and I shared. Sometimes when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> poster, I think it looks a bit like the sitting room in Cleveland Square where our studio was, but this may be only my imagination".|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{not feeling}} lonely with you--not a bit. It {{is only when}} we come up to <b>that</b> place, and <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> all <b>that</b> water and all that light--" ...|$|R
2500|$|... "A {{satellite}} map is {{a beautiful}} thing. <b>I</b> ALWAYS <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> first when <b>I</b> open a newspaper because it's a read out of the elements, the currents, and wind patterns that determine our survival." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This colour {{always has}} a {{soothing}} effect on me," [...] he explained. [...] "Yellow excites me too much--makes me restless--makes me want to sail 'beyond the bourne of sunset'. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> surge of golden glow down there today till I got all worked up and thought my life had been an awful failure. I found a dead butterfly and had a little funeral--buried it in the fern corner. And I thought I hadn't been any more use {{in the world than}} that poor little butterfly. Oh, I was woeful, master. Then I got me this hollyhock and sat down here to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it alone. When a man's alone, master, he's most with God--or with the devil. The devil rampaged around me all the time <b>I</b> was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> golden glow; but God spoke to me through the hollyhock. And {{it seemed to me that}} a man who's as happy as I am and has got such a garden has made a real success of living." ...|$|R

60|$|In fact {{nothing could}} well be more simple--more utterly unpretending than this cottage. Its marvellous effect lay {{altogether}} in its artistic arrangement as a picture.
