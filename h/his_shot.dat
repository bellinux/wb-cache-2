5|$|Before {{the second}} half, no substitutions {{were made by}} either teams as Galatasaray kicked-off the match. During the third minute, Vieira picked Parlour, but <b>his</b> <b>shot</b> hit {{the outside of the}} goal. Galatasaray almost scored the opening goal, when Okan Buruk played in Hakan Şükür, whose shot hit the right post. Arsenal {{attempted}} to strike, with Sylvinho passing Hagi, and finding Henry, who in turn put in a cross for Keown, only for <b>his</b> <b>shot</b> to go over. Later throughout the match, Parlour sent a long ball into the Galatasaray midfield, but no Arsenal player was there to pick up the ball. A free-kick was given to Bergkamp after a foul on Overmars, which was cleared with a Popescu header. Galatasaray attempted an attack on the counter – Capone gave the ball to Hagi, who lost his balance while preparing to take a shot. After receiving a pass, Hagi put in a wide cross for Şükür, but he was denied a shot on target after a clearance. Arsenal had another chance, when Henry snatched the ball from Korkmaz, and entered the penalty area, only to see <b>his</b> <b>shot</b> to go off target.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool got {{the first}} half of extra time under way, but the start was slow as players {{suffered}} with cramp, Carragher in particular. In the 97th minute, Liverpool won a corner, which West Ham cleared to Liverpool defender John Arne Riise {{on the edge of the}} penalty area, but <b>his</b> <b>shot</b> went over the crossbar. Liverpool won another corner in the 99th minute, which was cleared by West Ham; the ball came back into the penalty area and Morientes headed down for Cissé, but he was unable to control the ball. Before the end of the half, Hyypiä had a chance to score after running past Scaloni and Harewood, but <b>his</b> <b>shot</b> went wide of the West Ham goal.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United {{started the}} second half in attacking fashion, as they had chances immediately. A Silvestre run down the pitch {{resulted}} in a pass that found Van Nistelrooy {{on the edge of}} the Liverpool penalty area, but <b>his</b> <b>shot</b> went high and wide of the goal. He had another chance a minute later, but despite beating the offside trap set by the Liverpool defence, he could not beat Westerveld, who saved <b>his</b> <b>shot.</b> United's attacking start to the half was underlined by a third chance in as many minutes, but Scholes' shot went wide of the Liverpool goal. However, two minutes later, United's pressure told and they scored. A move that involved Beckham, Keane and Ryan Giggs resulted in the ball being played to Van Nistelrooy, who went around Westerveld and subsequently scored to reduce Liverpool's lead to 2–1. Beckham came close to levelling the match in the 62nd minute when he had two chances to score; he was unable to get <b>his</b> <b>shot</b> on target after Liverpool failed to clear a cross from Giggs and he was unable to score with a long-range shot.|$|E

5|$|The {{first shot}} on goal was {{registered}} by Bonaventure Kalou, who forced a save out of Jens Lehmann. After 10 minutes, Shinji Ono spotted Lehmann off his line but sent his lofted shot wide of the target. This sparked Dortmund into life; they were thwarted when Patrick Paauwe intercepted Jan Koller {{just as he}} was looking to get <b>his</b> <b>shot</b> away. On 15 minutes, they came even closer to breaking the deadlock, when Amoroso picked out Tomáš Rosický; however, he shot straight at Edwin Zoetebier. On 19 minutes, Pierre van Hooijdonk came close to scoring with a free kick, which hit the right-hand post. Feyenoord's Tomasz Rząsa was then booked for dissent on 23 minutes, and following the resulting free kick, Evanílson came close to scoring, though <b>his</b> <b>shot</b> went over the crossbar after Ewerthon's pass had sent him through.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} minutes saw Arsenal replace Hleb with Reyes in {{an attempt}} to equalise, but Barcelona had the best chance during this period, only for Giuly to hit <b>his</b> <b>shot</b> straight at Almunia. Following this, Larsson impeded the Arsenal goalkeeper and was cautioned as a result.|$|E

5|$|The {{shoot-out}} {{took place}} at the end where the West Ham fans were seated, with Liverpool taking the first penalty. Hamann stepped up first and scored high to the right of Hislop. Zamora took the first penalty for West Ham, but <b>his</b> <b>shot</b> was saved by Reina. Hyypiä took the next penalty for Liverpool, but he also missed, as Hislop saved <b>his</b> <b>shot.</b> Substitute Sheringham took West Ham's next penalty and scored, <b>his</b> <b>shot</b> beating Reina high to his left to level the shoot-out at 1–1. Liverpool captain Gerrard took their next penalty and scored to make it 2–1, while Konchesky's shot was saved by Reina. Riise took the next penalty for Liverpool and scored to extend their lead to 3–1. Ferdinand was next and needed to score to keep West Ham in the shoot-out, but his penalty was saved by Reina, which meant Liverpool won the shoot-out 3–1 to win the FA Cup for the seventh time.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{then made}} their second substitution, {{bringing}} on Van Persie {{in place of}} Cesc Fàbregas. As the match entered injury time {{at the end of}} the second half, Ronaldo made yet another run down the left wing, outpacing Lauren to Rooney's through-ball. The ball broke back to Rooney 30 yards from goal, but <b>his</b> <b>shot</b> went over the bar. The second half finished with a Wes Brown cross from the right wing that made its way across the penalty area to Ronaldo, but the Portuguese could only head the ball straight at Lehmann.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{took the}} lead in the 65th minute when Jimmy Logie's pass was {{collected}} by Holton. <b>His</b> <b>shot</b> at goal rebounded into the path of Doug Lishman, who was following up, and he scored.

5|$|Beginning {{around the}} 2008–09 season, Henrik began {{to expand his}} {{skill-set}} by scoring more goals. His increased tendency to shoot was given an extra push when Daniel suffered the first major injury of his career early in the 2009–10 season, forcing Henrik to play without his brother and consequently pass less often. He recorded the first two 20-goal seasons {{of his career in}} 2008–09 and 2009–10, and increased <b>his</b> <b>shot</b> totals.|$|E
5|$|Brugge now {{needed to}} score, but they only created one more chance. Ten {{minutes before the}} end of the match, Sørensen intercepted a Hansen backpass and shot. <b>His</b> <b>shot</b> was blocked by Clemence, and a {{goal-line}} clearance by Phil Thompson prevented Brugge from equalising. The match remained at 1–0 and Liverpool won their second consecutive European Cup, becoming the first British team to retain the trophy.|$|E
5|$|Davies scored for Bolton on 21 {{minutes when}} an error by Middlesbrough goalkeeper Schwarzer allowed <b>his</b> <b>shot</b> {{to go inside}} his near post. Bolton {{continued}} to attack, and Schwarzer made a double save from winger Per Frandsen and Djorkaeff. The latter had two more chances soon after, missing the target with the first. Boro pleaded for a second penalty when Nicky Hunt pulled Job, but referee Riley did not give it.|$|E

5|$|However, Liverpool did {{score from}} their next attack. Gerrard played a {{ball into the}} West Ham penalty area, which went {{over the head of}} defender Scaloni and was met by striker Djibril Cissé, who scored to make it 2–1. Ashton came close to {{extending}} West Ham's lead in the 37th minute, but his effort went wide of the post after beating goalkeeper Reina. The last chance of the half came in the 44th minute when Liverpool defender Steve Finnan sliced a clearance straight to striker Harewood, however <b>his</b> <b>shot</b> went out for a throw-in.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after this}} match, Jardine made his Test debut against the West Indies who were touring England that season. This was West Indies' first ever Test match. The team possessed several fast bowlers who had enjoyed some {{success on the}} tour of England. Many batsmen only played them with difficulty, {{particularly}} on the occasional fast-paced pitch, but Jardine played them confidently. Jardine played {{in the first two}} Tests, both of which were won by England by an innings, but missed the third for unknown reasons. He scored 22 on his debut, but was more successful in the second Test. He scored 83: when he had scored 26, he hit his wicket when setting off for a run, but was given not out. At the time, a batsman was not out if he had completed <b>his</b> <b>shot</b> and was setting off for a run; the West Indian cricketer Learie Constantine believed that Jardine was only given not out because he told the umpire <b>his</b> <b>shot</b> was complete. Later, while he was batting with Tate, a player with whom {{he did not have a}} good relationship, Jardine was run out when Tate refused to go for a run.|$|E
500|$|Jardine {{asked me}} if I could bowl on the leg stump making the ball come up into the body all the time, so that Bradman had to play <b>his</b> <b>shots</b> to leg. [...] "Yes, I think that can be done", I said... I had no doubt of its purpose: we thought Don was frightened of sharp rising balls, and we {{reasoned}} that if he {{got a lot of}} them he would be... intimidated and eventually, having to direct <b>his</b> <b>shots</b> to leg all the time, would give a catch to one of the [...] fieldsmen".|$|R

5000|$|Mečíř was a finesse player {{whose career}} straddled the {{transition}} from wooden and metal racquets towards modern graphite composites.

His court coverage and graceful footwork earned him the nickname [...] "The Big Cat". The French called him [...] "Le Prestidigitateur" [...] (The Conjuror).|$|R
5|$|Liverpool had {{a chance}} to extend their lead in the 74th minute, but Gerrard was unable to score from a cross by Núñez, with <b>his</b> <b>shot</b> going wide of the Chelsea goal. Liverpool pressed forward and a sliding tackle from Chelsea captain John Terry {{prevented}} Baroš from shooting in the Chelsea penalty area. Chelsea were awarded a free-kick in the 79th minute which was taken by Ferreira, the ball was met by Gerrard who intended to head it clear, but scored an own goal after heading the ball into the Liverpool goal. The score was now 1–1. Chelsea made their final substitution following the goal, with Glen Johnson replacing Cole. Chelsea manager Mourinho was sent off following the goal for making a gesture towards the Liverpool fans. Chelsea nearly took the lead in the 82nd minute, but Duff's shot was saved by Dudek. Chelsea had a few chances to score in the following exchanges, but all the efforts missed the Liverpool goal. Liverpool's only chance {{in the rest of the}} half fell to Baroš, but he also put <b>his</b> <b>shot</b> wide. With the scores at 1–1, following the end of 90 minutes the match went to extra time.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{were the}} first team to take a penalty, but Gerrard's effort was saved by Heaton. Cardiff's first penalty was taken by Miller, but he also missed with <b>his</b> <b>shot</b> hitting the post. Adam took the next penalty for Liverpool, he also missed, placing <b>his</b> <b>shot</b> over the Cardiff goal. Cowie took the next penalty for Cardiff and scored to give them a 1–0 lead. Liverpool also scored with their next penalty {{courtesy}} of Kuyt to level the shoot-out at 1–1. Gestede was next for Cardiff, but his penalty hit the post. Liverpool took the lead in the shoot-out when Downing converted his penalty. Whittingham was next for Cardiff and he scored to level the shoot-out at 2–2. Johnson took the next penalty for Liverpool and scored, to give Liverpool a 3–2 lead and leave Cardiff needing to score or Liverpool would win. The Cardiff was taken by Anthony Gerrard, but he missed his penalty, which meant Liverpool won the shoot-out 3–2 and won their eighth League Cup.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United {{kicked off}} the match, but within the first two minutes they had conceded a goal. A foul on Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy by United captain Roy Keane {{resulted}} in a Liverpool penalty, which Gary McAllister subsequently scored to give Liverpool a 1–0 lead. Minutes later, Liverpool were awarded a free kick, but McAllister was unable to score, hitting Manchester United's defensive wall. United had their first chance two minutes later, but Van Nistelrooy miscued <b>his</b> <b>shot</b> in front of goal. In the 11th minute, Liverpool's lead was almost extended as United midfielder Nicky Butt almost diverted a cross from Riise into his own goal. Five minutes later, Liverpool did extend their lead; United defender Jaap Stam slipped after Liverpool striker Emile Heskey headed the ball down to Michael Owen, allowing Owen to sidestep Gary Neville and place <b>his</b> <b>shot</b> into the United goal to make the score 2–0. The frustration of the United players was beginning to show and immediately after the goal, Paul Scholes was shown a yellow card for a challenge on Dietmar Hamann.|$|E
