25|$|The 1978 album Hot Streets was {{produced}} by Phil Ramone. It was Chicago's first album with a title rather than a number; and was the band's first LP to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of the band (shot by photographer Norman Seeff) featured prominently on the cover (with the ubiquitous logo downsized). These two moves were {{seen by many as}} indications that the band had changed following Kath's death. To a degree, the band returned to the old naming scheme on its subsequent releases, although most titles would now bear Arabic numerals rather than Roman numerals. Hot Streets, the band's 12th album, peaked at No. 12 on the Billboard charts; it was Chicago's first release since their debut to fail to make the Top 10. The release also marked a move somewhat away from the jazz-rock direction favored by Kath and towards more pop songs and ballads. Dacus stayed with the band through the 1979 album Chicago 13, and is also featured in a promotional video on the DVD included in the Rhino Records Chicago box set from 2003. Again produced by Ramone, it was the group's first studio album not to contain a Top 40 hit. Dacus departed from the band shortly after the album's release.|$|E

The original cover was intended to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of Nas holding Jesus Christ in a headlock, reflecting the religious imagery of Nas's rap on [...] "Live at the Barbeque"; [...] "When I was 12, I went to hell for snuffing Jesus".|$|E

Crowther noted its [...] "devious convolutions of the plot", and praised the screenplay quality as [...] "of the best" [...] and the cast's performances as [...] "all of the first order".|$|E
500|$|Before the 2012 refurbishment, guests rode in [...] "test vehicles" [...] in a GM [...] "testing facility" [...] {{and were}} taken {{through a series}} of {{assessments}} to illustrate how automobile prototype evaluations are conducted. The highlight of the attraction was (and still is) a speed trial on a track around the exterior of the Test Track building at a top speed of 64.9 miles per hour (104.4km/h) making it the fastest Disney theme park attraction ever built. [...] After the 2012 refurbishment, guests design their own car in the Chevrolet Design Studio. Then they board a [...] "Sim-Car" [...] and are taken through the [...] "digital" [...] testing ground of the [...] "SimTrack". Throughout the ride, guests see how their designs performed in each individual test.

500|$|The lines by Pope, though {{referring}} to Theobald, {{the hero of}} The Dunciad, are a characterisation of a Grub Street hack, a stereotype popular in the 1730s denoting a man of limited writing ability who lived in poverty but nevertheless determinedly pursued a career in literature;, Therefore, the particular scribbler depicted in the painting {{would be one of}} this fraternity of [...] "witlings" [...] who banded together to protest Pope's poem. In this context it would make sense, therefore, for the poet to have the scabrous anti-Pope print, or an emblem of Pope's fight with the hack writers' patron, above him. Just as Moll Hackabout has a picture of [...] Macheath on her wall in A Harlot's Progress, this aspiring and witless poet would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of his hero, Edmund Curll, and an anti-Pope print. The emblem, in other words, identifies the poet's [...] "side" [...] in the battle between dunces and men of wit.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{response}} in the United States proved to be less favourable. In a review published in Virginia in January 1983, Edward Jones of The Free-Lance Star offered praise for the [...] "novel touch" [...] of casting a would-be-mother as the principal villain, commenting, [...] "In {{what has to be}} a new low, even for extraterrestrial-horror films, all the men end up punching this pregnant woman in the stomach. What a time to have twins!" [...] Nevertheless, Inseminoid is discarded as [...] "no more than a mix of everything-you've-ever-seen-in-a-horror-movie-and-didn't-particularly-want-to-see-again." [...] In a November 1983 edition of the Floridian newspaper Boca Raton News, Skip Sheffield branded the film [...] "horrible" [...] and [...] "cheapo", suggesting that his readers [...] "Imagine Alien without the fantastic sets, convincing special effects and literate dialogue, and you <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of Horror Planet." [...] He added his opinion that brutal violence does not guarantee narrative suspense, punning on the name Run Run Shaw in his downbeat conclusion that [...] "Horror Planet is a film to run, run away from—fast." ...|$|E
500|$|It is {{tradition}} for some alumni and other Spartan fans to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> {{taken with the}} Spartan statue to mark major life events. During graduation season there is {{a steady stream of}} recent graduates and their families posing with the statue. On weekends {{it is not uncommon to}} see newlywed couples doing the same. During the week before the annual football game against the University of Michigan Wolverines, members of the marching band take turns each guarding the statue against vandalism by fans of the rival school. The tradition is known as [...] "Sparty Watch"; a similar vigil takes place at the Michigan Diag, where the inlaid [...] "M" [...] is defended against MSU fans. During the full team walk from Kellogg Center to Spartan Stadium that takes place prior to each home football game, players and coaches toss or place pennies at the statue as they proceed past it. [...] After the final home football game the Spartan Marching Band circles the statue once before heading home to Adams Field.|$|E
