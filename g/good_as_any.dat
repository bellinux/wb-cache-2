5|$|Soon {{complications}} {{arise from}} these curses. Boomblehardt finds Sergeant Klooque's curse hilarious and decides {{that if he}} must give out money, the sergeant is as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>any</b> other. The shy Pipette throws herself at Sergeant, who unwillingly ducks and dodges, trying to avoid her. When Peter arrives, he is forced {{to get into a}} fight with the sergeant over her, at which, to his surprise, the brave sergeant cowers, dodges, and ducks. Boomblehardt continues passing out guineas, his fortune dribbling away. Then Martha chases her customers out of the inn with a broom: She too has been cursed. Everyone has fallen under the fairy's ironic curses, forced to behave in a manner contrary to his or her intrinsic nature.|$|E

25|$|In 1868 Huxley became Principal of the South London Working Men's College in Blackfriars Road. The moving {{spirit was}} a {{portmanteau}} worker, Wm. Rossiter, who {{did most of}} the work; the funds were put up mainly by F.D. Maurice's Christian Socialists. At sixpence for a course and a penny for a lecture by Huxley, this was some bargain; and so was the free library organised by the college, an idea which was widely copied. Huxley thought, and said, that the men who attended were as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>any</b> country squire.|$|E
25|$|The Central Arkansas Transit Authority {{provides}} {{bus service}} {{in and through}} the neighborhood. One Downtown to West Little Rock route travels Markham Street to Kavanaugh Boulevard providing residents access to both Downtown and the Rodney Parham Road area. Bus routes along 7th Street and Capitol Avenue provide access to the West Markham Street area and the Otter Creek Neighborhood. The bus system is radial, downtown to the outskirts and back, much like the spokes of a wheel. Therefore, to go east, north or south, the rider must first go downtown and transfer. The Capitol View/Stifft's Station neighborhood has a service level as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>any</b> residential area in metropolitan Little Rock.|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} he left hockey to fight in the war, Davidson was {{considered}} one of the top all-around players in the NHA. Noted for his skating ability, it was said that he could skate faster backwards than most players could forwards. In 1925, Maclean's named him the top right wing when it determined its all-star team of the game's greatest players, an opinion shared by his former junior coach, who stated that he was [...] "as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>any</b> player to ever patrol a wing position".|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the rivalry}} between regular and reserve officers, the 6th Division staff was an {{effective}} organisation. Brigadier John Harding, {{the chief of}} staff of XIII Corps, as the Western Desert Force was renamed on 1 January 1941, had been a student at Staff College, Camberley along with Mackay's chief of staff, Colonel Frank Berryman, at a time when O'Connor had been an instructor there. Harding later considered the 6th Division staff [...] "as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>any</b> that I came across in that war, and highly efficient." [...] Australian doctrine emphasised the importance of initiative in its junior leaders and small units were trained in aggressive patrolling, particularly at night.|$|E

500|$|In early 1911, Mertz went to London to {{meet with}} the Australian {{geologist}} and explorer Douglas Mawson. Mawson, who had served as physicist during Ernest Shackleton's 1908–09 Nimrod Expedition, was planning his own Antarctic expedition. In his application letter, Mertz wrote that he hoped Mawson would be using skis, as [...] "they have proved so good for the purpose & knowing that I am as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>any</b> one on skys." [...] While Mawson was intending to recruit only British subjects (chiefly Australians and New Zealanders), Mertz's qualifications prompted him to make an exception, and hire the Swiss as a ski instructor. First, however, he was given responsibility for the expedition's 49Greenland Huskies, aboard the expedition ship SY Aurora, bound for Hobart.|$|E
500|$|Casualty {{reports for}} the British range from 3killed and 20wounded to about 30each killed and wounded.

[...] The Americans claimed 20killed and another 20wounded, and Washington {{in a letter}} to Congress said the losses were [...] "not very considerable"; [...] however, the British reported burying 41 Americans, and Howe's official report claimed [...] "not less than fifty killed and many more wounded". General Maxwell was criticized for his leadership by a number of Washington's subordinates. [...] One foreign officer with service in the Army of Prussia commented to Henry Laurens in reference to Maxwell, [...] "Your soldiers are very good men, so <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>any</b> brave men in the world, but your officers my dear colonel, your officers..." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the captain}} and {{instigator}} of the 1888–89 Nativesthe first New Zealand team to tour the British IslesWarbrick had a lasting impact {{on the development of}} rugby in his homeland. When the Natives returned from tour they introduced a style of rugby as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>any</b> ever seen in the country. According to Ryan, [...] "their brand of sensational running style and combined forward play had never been seen in New Zealand." [...] The speculative nature of the tour, which was outside the control of an official authority, concerned many of the provincial unions and gave further momentum to efforts to form a national body. In 1892 the New Zealand Rugby Football Union was founded which would, among other things, organise any representative tours. Many of the Natives went on to contribute to rugby as representative players, administrators, or referees. Two players, Ellison and Gage, went on to captain New Zealand.|$|E

500|$|A spurt from Oxford at the Crab Tree pub made no {{impression}} on the lead. [...] Oxford were still out-rating by Cambridge three strokes per minute as they passed below Hammersmith Bridge, two lengths adrift of the Light Blues. [...] By Chiswick Steps, the lead was three lengths where Cambridge saw off another spurt, with Oxford now rowing six strokes per minute faster than their opponents. [...] Able to relax, Cambridge passed the finishing post {{three and a half}} lengths clear of Oxford in a time of 18 minutes 15 seconds, the third fastest winning time in the event's history. [...] It was Cambridge's fourth consecutive victory and the fastest winning time since the 1948 race. [...] A correspondent writing in The Times described the victory as a [...] "great success" [...] and attributed the win to Cambridge's [...] "uniformity, precision, and properly covered blades ... not to the brilliance of any individuals in the boat." [...] Jack Beresford, writing in The Observer, suggested that Cambridge's crew was [...] "as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>any</b> since the war" [...] but that while Oxford [...] "rowed gallantly and never gave up", their technique was inadequate.|$|E
500|$|Legend of Mana {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. The game's presentation was almost universally praised, especially {{its use of}} vibrant and colorful hand-drawn graphics. David Smith of IGN claimed that the graphics {{were one of the}} game's best points, and RPGamer's Andrew P. Bilyk noted that the visuals [...] "may be the most impressive two-dimensional graphics ever to grace an RPG". Andrew Pfister of Electronic Gaming Monthly praised them even more, calling them [...] "the most impressive 2D artwork ever seen on a console". Damian Thomas's RPGFan review likened the graphics to Disney animation for having [...] "a very storybook, cutesy cartoony feel to them", while Andrew Vestal of GameSpot said that the graphics were some of the most lush and ornate 2D graphics ever made. The game won an award for best graphics at the 4th Japan Game Awards from the Computer Entertainment Supplier's Association. The music in Legend of Mana was also a high point in many reviews; the reviewers for Electronic Gaming Monthly called it [...] "fantastic" [...] and [...] "wonderful". Smith of IGN's review stated that the soundtrack is [...] "as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>any</b> you'll hear today" [...] with a good mix of intensity, suspense, and subtle nuance, and Vestal of GameSpot termed it [...] "excellently orchestrated" [...] and a perfect fit for the game in each environment.|$|E
500|$|... "Redux II" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an A rating {{and noted that}} [...] "whatever reservations I may have over a three-episode story arc, this final entry {{does a good job}} of re-investing us in the show's basic ideals, returning us to a rough form of the status quo in a way that's exciting, emotionally powerful, and satisfying despite only incremental forward momentum". In addition, Handlen praised David Duchovny's performance, stating that he [...] "was on fire the whole episode". Tom Kessenich praised {{the second part of the}} episode and wrote [...] "'Redux II' is the standout hour of the two without question. With Scully on her deathbed, Mulder meets his sister only to lose her again and is put in a position where he may deal with the devil. The finale moments [...] are quite simply perfect and as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>any</b> the show ever produced." [...] Shearman and Pearson rated the episode two-and-a-half stars out of five. The two noted [...] " [...] is a likable enough little romp, but it's too leisurely to be exciting, too predictable to be revealing, and–most crucially, not really funny enough to be comedy. Vitaris gave the second part of the episode a slightly less negative review than the first, but only awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. She criticized the ending, noting that [...] "it's all wrapped up neatly yet ambiguously." [...] However, Vitaris did note that [...] "what makes 'Redux II' tolerable is Duchovny, who always hits the right notes of anger, despair, grief, relief, or emotional numbness." [...] In the 1999 FX Thanksgiving Marathon, containing fan-selected episodes, [...] "Redux II" [...] (along with [...] "Gethsemane" [...] and [...] "Redux") was presented as the [...] "Best Mythology Episode".|$|E
