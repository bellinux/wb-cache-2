5|$|Blanche Rosalie Slaughter {{was born}} in 1876 in Lynchburg, Virginia to Mary Harker and John Flavel Slaughter. She had five {{brothers}} and one sister (three other siblings died in childhood), and was educated in Lynchburg before travelling to a finishing school in Baltimore. As a child, she occasionally assisted her two older brothers, who were doctors, on their house visits or by sterilising their instruments, and also attended to pets in her neighbourhood. Following {{the death of her}} father, who had strongly opposed <b>her</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> become a doctor, she joined the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania in 1893 using money saved from her childhood allowance.|$|E

5|$|In later years, Ernest Aris would blatantly plagiarise {{not only}} the Peter Rabbit {{character}} in his The Treasure Seekers but Jemima in his Mrs. Beak Duck. Potter was restrained when alerted to the imitations: she praised his technical artistry but chastised him {{for a lack of}} originality. At the time, her eyesight was deteriorating and her days were heavily invested in operating her farm; her restraint with Aris may be attributed to <b>her</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> enlist him as a collaborator.|$|E
5|$|Melanie {{was created}} by {{producer}} Mara Brock Akil. While casting the character, Brock Akil had doubts about whether Mowry {{would be the best}} choice, given her wholesome image from starring as Tia Landry on the sitcom Sister, Sister, but hired the actress based on her strong work ethic and <b>her</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> be part of the series. Mowry considered the character to be her first adult role and felt it emphasized her individuality and maturity. She identified closely with the part, observing parallels between Melanie's relationship with Derwin and her own marriage to actor Cory Hardrict. She cited The Game as an example of women receiving more lead roles on television.|$|E
5|$|Sue reveals <b>her</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> {{become a}} mother and asks Will to be the sperm donor. When Will's fiancee, Emma, confronts her about this request, Sue admits that she wants Will's {{capacity}} for kindness for her child. Emma and Will's relationship becomes strained as he focuses on impressing Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) to win tenure, and denigrates her newest set of counseling pamphlets. He is surprised when Coach Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones) enthusiastically praises Emma for her recent pamphlet on genital sanitation, which has just been adopted by the Big Ten football teams.|$|E
5000|$|In February 2015, Charlotte Alter of TIME {{described}} Kayla Mueller as {{an ideal}} role model for Millennials, citing <b>her</b> selfless <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> end suffering, <b>her</b> activism, and her humanitarian aid work, and praising <b>her</b> <b>desire</b> not <b>to</b> be seen, but to genuinely help people. According to Alter, [...] "Mueller represented the best qualities of the millennial generationour idealism, our optimism, and our love of our familieswithout the troublesome ones." ...|$|R

5|$|The plot follows Jon Snow's {{training}} at The Wall; Eddard's arrival at King's Landing, followed by Catelyn, looking for Bran's would-be murderer; Arya reveals <b>her</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> learn sword fighting to her father; Joffrey {{is given a}} lesson in ruling the Kingdom by Cersei, and Robert longs for the glory of his past. Meanwhile, Daenerys learns she is pregnant. The episode {{was the first to}} feature Old Nan, played by Margaret John, who died before the series was broadcast; the episode is dedicated to her memory in the final credit.|$|E
5|$|After Smith's death, Emma Smith {{quickly became}} alienated from Brigham Young {{and the church}} leadership. Young, whom Emma feared and despised, was {{suspicious}} of <b>her</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> preserve the family's assets from inclusion {{with those of the}} church, and thought she would be even more troublesome because she openly opposed plural marriage. When most Latter Day Saints moved west, she stayed in Nauvoo, married a non-Mormon, Major Lewis C. Bidamon, and withdrew from religion until 1860, when she affiliated with the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, first headed by her son, Joseph Smith III. Emma never denied Smith's prophetic gift or repudiated her belief in the authenticity of the Book of Mormon.|$|E
5|$|Carpentier was {{an admirer}} of the elegance and wit {{in the work of}} satirical French writers and artists of the eighteenth century, and often {{employed}} grotesques in his descriptions to ridicule the ostentation of colonial aristocracy. Examples include Ti Noel's comparison of wax heads at a barber's shop to white men's heads being served at a banquet, or the portrayal of the decadence of Mademoiselle Floridor, a fourth-rate actress who performs for slaves as an outlet for <b>her</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> act. Carpentier further satirizes the pomp of those in power through a series of details of protocol and ceremony whose cumulative effects ridicule the object of description, {{as is the case with}} Henri Christophe's chambers.|$|E

60|$|Her words {{rang out}} shrill and venomous with her secret scorn, with <b>her</b> overpowering <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> wound {{regardless}} of consequences; in <b>her</b> woman's reckless <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> cause suffering at any cost, to cause {{it by the}} sound of her own voice--by her own voice, that would carry the poison of her thought into the hated heart.|$|R

5|$|Zenobia: {{the wife}} of Odaenathus was accused by the Augustan History of having {{formerly}} conspired with Maeonius, as Hairan I was her stepson {{and she could not}} accept that he was the heir to her husband instead of her own children. However, there is no suggestion in the Augustan History that Zenobia was involved in the event that saw her husband's murder; the act is attributed to Maeonius' degeneracy and jealousy. Those accounts by the Augustan History can be dismissed as fiction. The hints in modern scholarship that Zenobia had a hand in the assassination out of <b>her</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> rule the empire and dismay with her husband's pro-Roman policy can be dismissed as there was no reversal of that policy during the first years following Odaenathus' death.|$|E
5|$|According to Twain, {{she became}} {{depressed}} and lost <b>her</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> live after the divorce. As a distraction, {{she began to}} write a memoir, titled From This Moment On after the 1998 song of the same name. She then re-evaluated her life and noted a pattern of withholding emotions, which affected her voice for both speaking and singing. She explained {{the loss of her}} voice resulted from the cumulative stress of experiencing domestic violence in her childhood, the death of her parents, stress from her musical career, and the divorce. As a result, the singer developed dysphonia, an impairment in the ability to produce sound because of tightened muscles enveloping her voice box. In order to recover, Twain embarked on a documented journey with the series Why Not? with Shania Twain. Twain's wanted go outside her comfort zone and perform once again, while inspiring viewers to be proactive about their own problems.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Ono's {{family moved}} without her to Scarsdale, New York, an {{affluent}} town 25 {{miles north of}} mid-town Manhattan. When she later rejoined her family in the U.S., she enrolled at nearby Sarah Lawrence College. While her parents approved of her college choice, Ono said that they disapproved of her lifestyle and chastised her for befriending people they felt were beneath her. In spite of her parents' disapproval, Ono loved meeting artists, poets, and others who represented the bohemian lifestyle to which she aspired. She visited galleries and art happenings in the city; this whetted <b>her</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> publicly display her own artistic endeavors. American avant-garde artist, composer, and musician La Monte Young was her first important contact in the New York art world; he helped Ono start her career by using her Chambers Street loft in Tribeca as a performance space. After Ono set a painting on fire at one performance, her mentor John Cage advised her to treat the paper with flame retardant.|$|E

He was furious with Hernández at first as the journalistic profession at that time in Mexico had a reputation of being in the pockets of corrupt government officials.|$|R
5|$|Among the {{remarkable}} events of Tamar's reign was {{the foundation of}} the Empire of Trebizond on the Black Sea coast in 1204. This state was established by Alexios I Megas Komnenos (r. 1204–1222) and his brother, David, in the northeastern Pontic provinces of the crumbling Byzantine Empire with the aid of Georgian troops. Alexios and David, Tamar's relatives, were fugitive Byzantine princes raised at the Georgian court. According to Tamar's historian, the aim of the Georgian expedition to Trebizond was to punish the Byzantine emperor Alexios IV Angelos (r. 1203–1204) for his confiscation of a shipment of money from the Georgian queen to the monasteries of Antioch and Mount Athos. However, Tamar's Pontic endeavor can better be explained by <b>her</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> take advantage of the Western European Fourth Crusade against Constantinople to set up a friendly state in Georgia's immediate southwestern neighborhood, {{as well as by the}} dynastic solidarity to the dispossessed Komnenoi.|$|E
5|$|An infant with {{a severe}} heart {{condition}} is admitted in neonatology, and is revealed to have been abandoned in a schoolyard by his biological mother, whose identity lies between four pre-adolescents. Montgomery quickly becomes emotionally involved in the case, reliving the feelings she went through after aborting the child conceived with Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane). Shepherd and O'Malley get quarantined after an outburst at the hospital, due to a patient suspected of having the plague. Their incapacity to leave the hospital leads to numerous confessions between the two, including Shepherd's reveal of his desire to divorce his wife and reconcile with Grey. Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) takes {{a leave of absence}} from the hospital, in a continuous attempt to bond with the grieving interns, who do not approve of her relationship with O'Malley. When a patient, Giselle Toussant (Elizabeth Goldstein), is admitted to the hospital, and ultimately dies in Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson)'s care, she begins to question her abilities as a surgeon, due to the guilt over the death of both Toussant and Duquette, whom she also performed surgery on. At the conclusion of the episode, Stevens overcomes her grief and gets off the floor, which metaphorically expresses <b>her</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> move on.|$|E
5|$|Callie Torres is {{introduced}} as an orthopedic surgery resident with {{a crush on}} intern George O'Malley (T.R. Knight). The two start a relationship and Torres moves into Meredith's house (Meredith and Izzie Stevens lived there as well). Uneased at the way their relationship is progressing, O'Malley confronts her, which results in her moving into a hotel. In {{the aftermath of the}} breakup, she meets and has a one-night stand with plastic surgeon Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), who becomes her friend. Torres and O'Malley subsequently reconcile, and the two marry in Las Vegas {{on the spur of the}} moment. Confused, O'Malley confides to fellow intern Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl), about his relationship woes over alcohol, leading to a drunken sexual encounter between the two. Torres remains unaware of his sexual encounter, but becomes increasingly suspicious, and announces <b>her</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> conceive a child. Shortly thereafter, however, she discovers that O'Malley has been unfaithful, ending their marriage. Though her personal life is troubled, Torres thrives professionally when she is appointed as the hospital's Chief Resident. However, she soon begins struggling to cope in the role, and is demoted soon thereafter.|$|E

5|$|Having {{seen the}} concerto delle donne in Ferrara, Caccini created a rival group {{made up of}} his family and a pupil. This {{ensemble}} was sponsored by the Medici, and traveled as far abroad as Paris to perform for Marie de' Medici. Francesca Caccini had much success composing and singing {{in the style of the}} concerto delle donne. Beginning in 1585, rival groups were created in Florence by the Medici, Rome by the Orsini, and Mantua by the Gonzaga. There was even a rival group in Ferrara based in the Castello Estense, the very palace where the concerto delle donne performed. This group was formed by Alfonso's sister Lucrezia d'Este, Duchess of Urbino. She had lived at the Este court since 1576, and shortly after Margherita's marriage to Alfonso in 1579, Alfonso and his henchmen killed Lucrezia's lover. Lucrezia was unhappy about being replaced as the matron of the house by Margherita, and upset by the murder of her lover, leading to <b>her</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> be separate from the rest of her family during her evening entertainments.|$|E
5|$|In 269, while Claudius Gothicus (Gallienus' successor) was {{defending}} {{the borders of}} Italy and the Balkans against Germanic invasions, Zenobia was cementing her authority; Roman officials in the East were caught between loyalty to the emperor and Zenobia's increasing demands for allegiance. The timing and rationale of the queen's decision {{to use military force}} to strengthen her authority in the East is unclear; scholar Gary K. Young suggested that Roman officials refused to recognize Palmyrene authority, and Zenobia's expeditions were intended to maintain Palmyrene dominance. Another factor may have been the weakness of Roman central authority and its corresponding inability to protect the provinces, which probably convinced Zenobia {{that the only way to}} maintain stability in the East was to control the region directly. Historian Jacques Schwartz tied Zenobia's actions to <b>her</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> protect Palmyra's economic interests, which were threatened by Rome's failure to protect the provinces. Also, according to Schwartz, the economic interests conflicted; Bostra and Egypt received trade which would have otherwise passed through Palmyra. The Tanukhids near Bostra and the merchants of Alexandria probably attempted to rid themselves of Palmyrene domination, triggering a military response from Zenobia.|$|E
5|$|Resignations {{from the}} order {{can take place}} only through the {{prescribed}} channels, which include the member submitting to the Secretary General of the Order of Canada a letter notifying the chancellery of his or <b>her</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> terminate their membership, and only with the governor general's approval can the resignation take effect. On 1 June 2009, the governor general accepted the resignations of astronomer and inventor René Racine, pianist Jacqueline Richard, and Cardinal Jean-Claude Turcotte; on 11 January 2010, did the same for Renato Giuseppe Bosisio, an engineering professor, and Father Lucien Larré; and on 19 April 2010 for Frank Chauvin. It was also reported that other constituents of the Order of Canada had, in reaction to Henry Morgentaler's induction into their ranks, {{indicated that they would}} return or had returned their emblems in protest, including organizations such as the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate and Madonna House Apostolate doing so on behalf of deceased former members.|$|E
