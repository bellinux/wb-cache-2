500|$|Outside of {{neurodegenerative}} disorders, physical injuries sustained {{during a}} career {{can have an}} adverse effect on post-career life. A 1990 survey conducted jointly between the NFLPA and Ball State University found that 65% of surveyed players had suffered a major injury (defined as one that caused them to miss at least eight games): among players that played before 1959 this number was 42%, but it jumps to 72% among those who played in the 1980s. Additionally, roughly 50% of players who had played in the 1970s and 1980s reported that they retired due to injury, compared to only 32% among those who played prior to 1959. Two-thirds of players reported that injuries they had sustained limited their ability to engage in recreational activity and sports in retirement, while half said their injuries decreased their ability to perform manual labor. A <b>follow-up</b> <b>survey</b> in 1994 found that 47% of recipients reported having arthritis. These reports {{have been attributed to}} several factors, including the increase in the use of artificial turf as well as the increasing size and speed of players. Dr. James Andrews, a noted orthopedic surgeon, said that [...] "athletes are bigger, stronger and running faster, and they're tearing up knees from cutting, changing direction on a dime". Andrews also noted {{the increase in the number}} of non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries, which he attributed to the size of modern players.|$|E
2500|$|The Cameroonian Bahá'í {{community}} has initiated and cooperated {{with a number}} of projects attempting to equalize the position of women, a primary principle of the religion.

The Bahá'ís of Cameroon cooperated with an initiative of the Bahá'í International Community in cooperation with UNIFEM on a project to effect a change in the social status of women in village communities in eastern Cameroon and other countries. The changes in the community focused on the role of women but aimed strongly at educating the men. According to Tiati Zock, the national coordinator of the project in Cameroon, a survey done in early 1992 among some 45 families in each of the seven villages reported that the men made virtually all of the financial decisions alone. A <b>follow-up</b> <b>survey,</b> taken in 1993, indicated more than 80 percent of the families now make such decisions in consultation between husband and wife.

The mean age was 6. 9 months (SD 5. 7); {{the mean number of}} days between skeletal surveys was 18. 7 (SD 10. 1) Four children (8. 5 %) had signs of healing bone trauma on a <b>follow-up</b> skeletal <b>survey.</b> Three of these children (75 %) had healing rib fractures and one child had a healing proximal humerus fracture.

40|$|In Germany {{a complex}} system of {{rehabilitation}} has developed {{in which the}} occupational rehabilitation centres (Berufsförderungswerken) are allocated the occupational rehabilitation of the 'more difficult cases'. In order to investigate {{how many of those}} undergoing rehabilitation find work after completing the training measure, the occupational rehabilitation centres have been conducting so-called 'follow-up surveys' since the mid- 1960 s. In addition to short-term and medium-term <b>follow-up</b> <b>surveys</b> (six months and one year after the end of rehabilitation), it also became necessary to organise long-term <b>follow-up</b> <b>surveys</b> (three and more {{years after the end of}} rehabilitation) as a result of the general decline on the labour market and the associated increase in the length of the reintegration process. On the basis of the longitudinal study conducted in 1998 it is shown that long-term <b>follow-up</b> <b>surveys</b> give a more accurate picture of the final reintegration result. With the aid of logistical regressions, the key variables which have an effect on the reintegration result are brought out and further tasks for research are discussed. In addition to reintegration in the narrow sense, the paper also goes into the stability and quality of the reintegration (duration of employment, suitability of the employment for the disability and the level of training/education etc.). Finally, possibilities of evaluating occupational rehabilitation in occupational rehabilitation centres are discussed and a third way beyond the experimental and non-experimental approach is shown.

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the feasibility of}} using patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) for longterm conditions (LTCs) in primary care. Design: A cohort postal survey conducted from September 2010 to April 2012. Setting: Primary care practices (n= 33) in London and the North-West of England. Participants: 4484 patients with a diagnosis of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, epilepsy, heart failure or stroke were sent a survey at baseline. Main outcome: The main outcome was to {{evaluate the}} feasibility of and the recruitment strategies for collecting PROMs data in LTCs by assessing the response rates for the baseline and <b>follow-up</b> <b>surveys.</b> Secondary outcomes were the evaluation of change scores of the EQ- 5 D index and visual analogue scale (VAS) between baseline and <b>follow-up</b> <b>surveys.</b> Results: The baseline survey achieved {{a response rate of}} 38. 4 % (n= 1721 / 4485) and at follow-up 71. 5 % (n= 1136 / 1589). Response rates varied by LTC.

Current UK policy aims to assess health service performance in LTCs by means of using PROMs. It thus would be desirable to improve response rates by making the invitation to self-reports of health-related quality of life more engaging for patients.
