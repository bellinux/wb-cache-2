5|$|A {{party can}} expand into an alliance, {{with up to}} three parties combined, {{with a total of}} 18 players. Alliances are {{necessary}} to complete more difficult challenges: including missions, quests, nation or territory driven events, and defeating notorious monsters. Much of end-game play consists of alliance forces overcoming these higher level challenges and can <b>even</b> <b>allow</b> several alliances to enter into specific instances owned by a group of players (e.g. Dynamis instances entry is controlled by an hourglass item).|$|E
5|$|Grand Theft Auto clones offer {{players the}} ability to steal and drive a number of vehicles. Games have {{included}} all kinds of vehicles, such as cars, helicopters, boats, jet-skis, fixed-wing aircraft, and military vehicles. Reviewers have compared these games {{based on the number}} of vehicles they offer, with greater choice resulting in better reviews. Players can also use vehicles as weapons, either by driving into enemies, or by damaging the vehicle until it explodes. Some games allow vehicles to perform stunts. Games in the genre thus incorporate elements of driving simulation games. Some games <b>even</b> <b>allow</b> players to customize their vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Combat is an {{important}} part of 4X gameplay, because 4X games allow a player to win by exterminating all rival players, or by conquering a threshold amount of the game's universe. Some 4X games, such as Galactic Civilizations, resolve battles automatically, whenever two units from warring sides meet. This is in contrast to other 4X games, such as Master of Orion, that allow players to manage battles on a tactical battle screen. Even in 4X games with more detailed control over battles, victory is usually determined by superior numbers and technology, with battle tactics playing a smaller part. 4X games differ from other combat-focused strategy games by putting more emphasis on research and economics. Researching new technology will grant access to new combat units. Some 4X games <b>even</b> <b>allow</b> players to research different unit components. This is more typical of space 4X games, where players may assemble a ship from a variety of engines, shields, and weaponry.|$|E

5|$|The {{object of}} {{blackjack}} {{is for a}} player to defeat the dealer by obtaining a total as close to 21 as possible without accumulating a total that exceeds this number. In blackjack, the standard rule {{is that if the}} player is dealt a pair of identically ranked initial cards, known as a pair, the player is allowed to split them into separate hands and ask for a new second card for each while placing a full initial bet identical to the original wager with each. After placing the wager for the split hands the dealer gives the player an additional card for each split card. The two hands created by splitting are considered independently in competition against the dealer. Splitting allows the gambler to turn a bad hand into one or two hands with a good possibility of winning. It also allows the player to double the bet when the dealer busts. Some rules <b>even</b> <b>allow</b> for resplitting until the player has as many as four hands or allow doubling the bet after a split so that each hand has a bet double the original. The standard rules are that when a bet is doubled on a hand, the player is only allowed to draw one more card for that hand.|$|E
5|$|When the Sasanians reached Chalcedon in 615, {{it was at}} this point, {{according}} to Sebeos, that Heraclius had agreed to stand down and was about ready to become a client of the Sasanian emperor Khosrow II, allowing the Roman Empire to become a Persian client state, as well as <b>even</b> <b>allow</b> Khosrow II to choose the emperor. Things began to look even more grim for the Byzantines when Chalcedon fell in 617 to Shahin, making the Persians visible from Constantinople. Shahin courteously received a peace delegation but claimed {{that he did not have}} the authority to engage in peace talks, directing Heraclius to Khosrow, who rejected the peace offer. Still, the Persian forces soon withdrew, probably to focus on their invasion of Egypt. Yet the Persians retained their advantage, capturing Ancyra, an important military base in central Anatolia, in 620 or 622. Rhodes and several other islands in the eastern Aegean fell in 622/3, threatening a naval assault on Constantinople. Such was the despair in Constantinople that Heraclius considered moving the government to Carthage in Africa.|$|E

25|$|People {{with the}} above {{symptoms}} are commonly studied with computed tomography, or CT scan. The CT scan is very accurate (98%) in diagnosing diverticulitis. In order {{to extract the}} most information possible about the patient's condition, thin section (5mm) transverse images are obtained through the entire abdomen and pelvis after the patient has been administered oral and intravascular contrast. Images reveal localized colon wall thickening, with inflammation extending into the fat surrounding the colon. The diagnosis of acute diverticulitis is made confidently when the involved segment contains diverticula. CT may also identify patients with more complicated diverticulitis, such as those with an associated abscess. It may <b>even</b> <b>allow</b> for radiologically guided drainage of an associated abscess, sparing a patient from immediate surgical intervention.|$|E
25|$|Libraries {{are using}} open source {{software}} to develop information as well as library services. The purpose of open source {{is to provide a}} software that is cheaper, reliable and has better quality. The one feature that makes this software so sought after is that it is free. Libraries in particular benefit from this movement because of the resources it provides. They also promote the same ideas of learning and understanding new information through the resources of other people. Open source allows a sense of community. It is an invitation for anyone to provide information about various topics. The open source tools <b>even</b> <b>allow</b> libraries to create web-based catalogs. According to the IT source there are various library programs that benefit from this.|$|E
25|$|Although KFUO {{was well}} {{received}} and well supported, Maier envisioned a broader audience {{than could be}} reached by constructing local radio stations. By 1929, {{with the goal of}} spreading the gospel from coast-to-coast, he was investigating the logistics of network broadcasting. At this time, the major radio networks donated air time to the Federal Council of Churches, but no single denomination had ever produced a nationwide radio show dedicated to spreading the gospel. Having persuaded the Missouri Synod of the validity of this project, Maier contacted the National Broadcasting Company early in 1930. He was disappointed to find that NBC would not donate air time to the Lutheran Church, or any other single denomination. Worse still, they would not <b>even</b> <b>allow</b> the Lutheran Church to purchase air time. NBC’s policy, Maier was told, precluded putting religious time on a commercial basis.|$|E

25|$|A union may, in {{some limited}} circumstances, require {{employees}} to exhaust any internal appeals procedures provided under the union's constitution before filing suit. Unions and employers may also generally require employees to exhaust their {{rights under the}} grievance arbitration procedures provided for under {{the collective bargaining agreement}} before suing the employer for breach of contract. However employees do not usually have to exhaust such procedures if they are suing only the union, since very few collective bargaining agreements <b>even</b> <b>allow</b> for the filing of a grievance against the union by covered employees. To the extent that an employee might have a breach of contract claim against a union arising out of its performance of its duty to represent that employee, the courts will apply the same deferential standards and procedural requirements that they would employ if the worker sued the union on a breach of the duty of fair representation theory.|$|E
25|$|The Kut {{garrison}} {{was made}} up of the 6th (Poona) Division. Unlike a typical British division, or even an Ottoman one, Indian Army divisions had a complex make up. Battalions would be made up of companies from the various Indian ethnic and religious groups. Each group had its own dietary requirements. Hindus, for example, would never touch meat from a cow or <b>even</b> <b>allow</b> their food to be cooked in pots which had cooked cow meat. Sikhs, while allowing meat to be eaten, could not eat any animals slaughtered in accordance with a ritual, such as halal. Muslim troops required food prepared in accordance with halal. Finally, there were the British troops, whose diet was decided by Whitehall. Along the North-West Frontier, where Indian Army units traditionally were assigned, the mixed dietary needs were manageable. But in Mesopotamia, {{at the end of a}} long and poorly developed supply line, the problem was significantly more difficult. At the start of the siege, in December 1915, Townshend reported he had enough food to feed the sepoys of his division for 54 days.|$|E
25|$|Minimum wage rates {{vary greatly}} across many {{different}} jurisdictions, {{not only in}} setting a particular amount of money—for example $7.25 per hour ($14,500 per year) under certain US state laws (or $2.13 for employees who receive tips, which {{is known as the}} tipped minimum wage), $9.47 in the US state of Washington, or £7.50 (for those aged 25+) in the United Kingdom—but also in terms of which pay period (for example Russia and China set monthly minimum wages) or the scope of coverage. Currently the American federal minimum wage rests at seven dollars, twenty-five cents ($7.25) per hour. However, some states do not recognize the minimum wage law such as Louisiana and Tennessee. Other states operate below the federal minimum wage such as Georgia and Wyoming. Some jurisdictions <b>even</b> <b>allow</b> employers to count tips given to their workers as credit towards the minimum wage levels. India {{was one of the first}} developing countries to introduce minimum wage policy. It also has one of the most complicated systems with more than 1,200 minimum wage rates.|$|E

500|$|Endospores show no {{detectable}} {{metabolism and}} can survive extreme {{physical and chemical}} stresses, such as high levels of UV light, gamma radiation, detergents, disinfectants, heat, freezing, pressure, and desiccation. In this dormant state, these organisms may remain viable for millions of years, and endospores <b>even</b> <b>allow</b> bacteria to survive exposure to the vacuum and radiation in space. According to scientist Dr. Steinn Sigurdsson, [...] "There are viable bacterial spores {{that have been found}} that are 40 million years old on Earth—and we know they're very hardened to radiation." [...] Endospore-forming bacteria can also cause disease: for example, anthrax can be contracted by the inhalation of Bacillus anthracis endospores, and contamination of deep puncture wounds with Clostridium tetani endospores causes tetanus.|$|E
500|$|Fossas {{communicate}} using sounds, scents, {{and visual}} signals. Vocalizations include purring, a threatening call, and a call of fear, consisting of [...] "repeated loud, coarse inhalations and gasps of breath". A long, high yelp may function to attract other fossas. Females mew during mating and males produce a sigh {{when they have}} found a female. Throughout the year, animals produce long-lasting scent marks on rocks, trees, and the ground using glands in the anal region and on the chest. They also communicate using face and body expression, but {{the significance of these}} signals is uncertain. The animal is aggressive only during mating, and males in particular fight boldly. After a short fight, the loser flees and is followed by the winner for a short distance. In captivity, fossas are usually not aggressive and sometimes <b>even</b> <b>allow</b> themselves to be stroked by a zookeeper, but adult males in particular may try to bite.|$|E

500|$|In 1854 the United States {{pressured}} Japan {{into the}} Convention of Kanagawa, which ended Japan's isolation, but {{was considered an}} [...] "unequal treaty" [...] by the Japanese public, since the US did not reciprocate most of Japan's concessions with similar privileges. In many cases Japan was effectively forced into a system of extraterritoriality that provided for the subjugation of foreign residents {{to the laws of}} their own consular courts instead of the Japanese law system, open up ports for trade, and later <b>even</b> <b>allow</b> Christian missionaries to enter the country. Shortly after the end of Japan's seclusion, in a period called [...] "Bakumatsu" [...] (幕末, [...] "End of the Shogunate"), the first German traders arrived in Japan. In 1860 Count Friedrich Albrecht zu Eulenburg led the Eulenburg Expedition to Japan as ambassador from Prussia, a leading regional state in the German Confederation at that time. After four months of negotiations, another [...] "unequal treaty", officially dedicated to amity and commerce, was signed in January 1861 between Prussia and Japan.|$|E
500|$|Microorganisms {{are found}} in almost every habitat present in nature, {{including}} hostile environments such as the North and South poles, deserts, geysers, and rocks. They also include all the marine microorganisms of the oceans and deep sea. Some types of microorganisms have adapted to extreme environments and sustained colonies; these organisms are known as extremophiles. Extremophiles have been isolated from rocks as much as 7 kilometres below the Earth's surface, {{and it has been}} suggested that the amount of organisms living below the Earth's surface is comparable with the amount of life on or above the surface. Extremophiles have been known to survive for a prolonged time in a vacuum, and can be highly resistant to radiation, which may <b>even</b> <b>allow</b> them to survive in space. Many types of microorganisms have intimate symbiotic relationships with other larger organisms; some of which are mutually beneficial (mutualism), while others can be damaging to the host organism (parasitism). If microorganisms can cause disease in a host they are known as pathogens and then they are sometimes referred to as microbes.|$|E
