Recent proposals are going to develop at least a uniform rule about jurisdictional competence, based on the mechanism of the forum necessitatis, already envisaged by article 7 of the <b>EC</b> regulation <b>No.</b> 4 / 2009. That innovation isalso a consequence of the proposed abolition of national exorbitant fora. The paper describes the general characteristics of the mechanism, that can be used only on a subsidiary and exceptional basis, i. e. when no provision would otherwise confer jurisdiction on a Member State. Accordingly, such a mechanism departs from the principles of predictability and proximity of the head of jurisdiction, because it applies when the dispute is closely connected to a third State. In that context the use of forum necessitatis is required in order to prevent or to remedy a denial of justice that could take place (or has already taken place) in the third State. When the denial of justice would affect procedural or substantive fundamental human rights of the claimant, the forum necessitatis mechanism allows him/her to bring his/her action before the courts of the Member States. More detailed requirements as to the existence of a denial of justice are envisaged in the proposal to revise <b>EC</b> regulation <b>No.</b> 44 / 2001. In addition, the dispute must have a «sufficient connection» to the Member State of the forum; such a requirement is needed in order to provide the allocation of jurisdictional competence between Member States...|$|R

The proposal for an extension of the programme was based on the positive assessment reached in a mid-term evaluation report. Specifically, the report examined the role of the LIFE programme in the implementation and development of European environmental policy and legislation, and the actual management of LIFE III.|$|E
30|$|Restrictions {{on foreign}} entry, other discriminatory measures, and {{barriers}} to competition {{are the most}} relevant policy areas in the computation of the air transport STRI. For the Swiss air industry, barriers to entry and competition are the most relevant restrictions. For instance, only companies that are majority-owned and controlled by Switzerland, member states of the European Union, or their nationals are granted an operating license (Art. 4 (f) <b>EC</b> Regulation <b>No</b> 1008 / 2008). This provision contributes crucially to the score of the category restrictions on foreign entry. Furthermore, policy measures regarding the exemption of air carrier alliances from competition law and slot allocation systems are assessed as restrictive in the policy area barriers to competition. By law, air carriers are allowed to combine air services and to enter into code share arrangements (Art. 15 <b>EC</b> Regulation <b>No</b> 1008 / 2008). In addition, they may retain already allocated slots from one season to the next (Art. 8 <b>EC</b> Regulation <b>No</b> 793 / 2004).|$|R

25|$|There {{are several}} web {{articles}} claiming that formaldehyde has been banned from manufacture or import into the European Union (EU) under REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and restriction of Chemical substances) legislation. This {{appears to be}} misinformation, as official EU chemical databases contradict these claims as of February 19, 2010. This misconception has gained some ground. Formaldehyde is not listed in the Annex I of Regulation (<b>EC)</b> <b>No</b> 689/2008 (export and import of dangerous chemicals regulation), nor on a priority list for risk assessment. However, formaldehyde is banned from use in certain applications (preservatives for liquid-cooling and processing systems, slimicides, metalworking-fluid preservatives, and antifouling products) under the Biocidal Products Directive. In the EU, the maximum allowed concentration of formaldehyde in finished products is 0.2%, and any product that exceeds 0.05% has to include a warning that the product contains formaldehyde.|$|E

30|$|Within the European Union (EU), {{criteria}} for assessment of {{plant protection products}} (PPPs) for PBT or POP properties are given in <b>EC</b> Regulation <b>No.</b> 1107 / 2009 and assessments of individual COCs are conducted by Rapporteur Member States (RMS) of the EU {{in much the same}} way as registration of new active ingredients. There is no explicit framework or guidance for classification other than a draft document from the EU Directorate General for Health and Consumer Affairs (DG SANCO) [21], and, unlike REACH [7], there is no guidance for how studies are to be evaluated or how the relevance of the data in these studies is to be assessed. REACH recommends the use of a WoE approach for assessing data on chemicals in commerce but does not describe how this is to be done. <b>EC</b> Regulation <b>No.</b> 1107 / 2009 does not mention WoE at all. Under <b>EC</b> Regulation <b>No.</b> 1107 / 2009, if a PPP is classified as P, B, and/or T, exceeding trigger values for all three criteria ultimately results in a ban of the use of the product in the EU. Exceeding two of the criteria results in the PPP being listed for substitution with alternative pesticides that do not exceed established trigger values.|$|R
30|$|While CPY and its {{transformation}} products are not currently being formally evaluated as POPs under the SC, it has undergone simplified screening {{as an alternative}} to endosulfan. This screening suggested that CPY might meet all Annex D criteria (be a POP) but there are only equivocal or insufficient data [18]. CPY is widely used globally and some have suggested that its properties should be evaluated in the context of POPs [19].

30|$|Goals for protection, {{sometimes}} referred to as ‘assessment endpoints,’ are usually either identified explicitly or implicitly in regulations.

[8]. In the absence of more specific goals, it is logically assumed that the concern is for the general environment, not for a particular local scenario. For classification of COCs as POPs under the SC, this is a global concern. POPs identified under the SC are not permitted for use in the EU, so the environment of concern under <b>EC</b> Regulation <b>No.</b> 1107 / 2009 is that within the EU, which is the jurisdiction of regulation.
