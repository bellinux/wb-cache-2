5|$|<b>Home</b> <b>Health</b> Aide: The <b>home</b> <b>health,</b> or hospice, aide {{is not a}} {{core service}} for a hospice patient; this means it is not {{required}} that every patient on hospice receive an aide. However, most patients do receive this service, and it is often the one most depended on by the patient and family. The hospice aide typically visits anywhere from 3–7 {{days a week for}} approximately 1–2 hours at each visit. His or her functions include providing respite to the primary caregiver and physical support to the patient, including bathing, dressing, or feeding. Many times it is the hospice aide who develops the closest relationship with the patient, due to the frequency of visits. The hospice aide is not a licensed nurse and therefore can not administer medications, treat wounds, handle IV's or similar treatments.|$|E

5|$|Hospice is a {{competitive}} business. In any given service area, {{there may be}} hundreds of different non-profit and commercial providers. Hospices can be small community-based operations, part of regional and national corporations, or part of a hospital or other health system. Data from the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization indicated that in 2008 58.3% of hospice agencies were independent, with 20.8% based in hospitals, 19.7% geared for <b>home</b> <b>health</b> care and 1.3% in conjunction with nursing homes. In 2007, {{the mean number of}} patients being treated in hospice facilities on any given day was 90.2. 79.4% of hospice providers admitted fewer than 500 patients per year. The number of for-profit and non-profit providers has become more balanced as the for-profit sector has grown. In 2007, 47.1% of agencies were for-profit, with 48.6% non-profit. The remaining 4.3% were government-owned providers.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in order to identify factors influencing depression and quality of life in elderly customized <b>home</b> visiting <b>health</b> services. Methods: A total of 442 people participated as the subjects of this study. Data were collected during the period from June to September in 2010 and the measurement tool used for this study was the customized <b>home</b> visiting <b>health</b> service recording sheet recommended by the Ministry of Health. Data were analyzed using t-test, one-way ANOVA, Pearson correlation coefficients, and stepwise multiple regression with SPSS/WIN 17. 0. Results: Depression was correlated negatively with quality of life. According to the results of this research, factors influencing depression in elderly customized <b>home</b> visiting <b>health</b> services were quality of life, customized <b>home</b> visiting <b>health</b> service period, and IADL. Factors influencing quality of life in elderly customized <b>home</b> visiting <b>health</b> services were depression, joint exercise capacity, age, connection to volunteerism, IADL and ADL. Conclusion: The results of this study can be leveraged as complementary infor-mation for the effective management of customized <b>home</b> visiting <b>health</b> service subjects.

25|$|On January 23, 2006, CVS {{announced}} that it had agreed to acquire the freestanding drug store operations of supermarket chain Albertsons. The deal included the acquisition of 700 drug stores trading under the Osco Drug and Sav-On Drugs banners, mostly in the midwestern and southwestern United States (with a concentration of stores in southern California and the Chicago area), and was formally completed on June 2, 2006. Transition of Sav-On and Osco stores to the CVS brand was completed by December 2006. CVS now dominates the southern California market. Also included were Albertsons Health'n'Home (now CVS <b>Home</b> <b>Health)</b> durable medical equipment stores. Approximately 28 CVS <b>Home</b> <b>Health</b> locations are present in Arizona, California, and the Kansas City area, representing CVS's first venture into the specialized DME market.CVS had previously operated stores in southern California but completely withdrew from the market in 1993. CVS sold {{virtually all of the}} locations to Sav-On's then owner American Stores, who operated them under the name American Drug Stores. Many of the stores CVS gained in January 2006 had been the stores it owned prior to 1993. Before their re-acquisition, these stores were operated under the name Sav-On Express (the Express name was used to help customers identify these stores that did not carry all the lines of merchandise as compared to the larger, traditional Sav-On Drugs locations). CVS now operates over 6,200 stores in 43 states and the District of Columbia. In some locations, CVS now has two stores less than two blocks apart.|$|E
