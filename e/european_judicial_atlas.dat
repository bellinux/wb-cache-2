The first chapter deals with general information about judicial and police cooperation in criminal matters in the EU. It summarizes its history and discusses differences {{between the first and}} third pillar of the European Union and mentions the changes after adoption of the Lisbon Treaty which abolished the pillar structure. And thus communitarization of the third pillar has been made that has allowed deeper cooperation in criminal matters in the EU. Chapter Two describes Eurojust as a crucial institution of judicial cooperation in criminal matters in the EU. There is presented the history of Eurojust, its mission, tasks and organizational structure.

It then concludes by pointing out and situating other strategic areas where important synergies with EJT for the purpose of judicial Europeanization can be strengthened, notably enhancement of transnational judicial networks and introduction of knowledge management tools in national systems.

40|$|This article {{critically}} {{examines the}} functioning of <b>European</b> <b>judicial</b> networks as one modality of transnational dialogues between judges. In order to provide a conceptual framework, we first explore {{the meaning of the}} concepts of 'network', 'dialogue' and 'constitutional pluralism' and find that existing channels of communication between national courts and the CJEU hardly qualify as real dialogues. Then follows an in-depth examination of the practical workings of a number of well-established and active <b>European</b> <b>judicial</b> networks, which bring together judges who are more or less at the same level in their domestic judicial hierarchy and have similar functions in their respective legal systems. This involves determining who participates in judicial networks; how and to what end dialogues are conducted within these forums; and why judges may be motivated to participate in such networks. Using these insights, we argue that networks require a change in legal thinking, which is facilitated in the EU context by the constitutionalism pluralism discourse. Further, judicial networks have the potential to increase the dialogic qualities {{of the relationship between the}} CJEU and national courts, while they may at the same time affect the balance within that relationship in favour of the national courts...|$|R

40|$|Throughout {{this paper}} we have {{conducted}} a general examination of the principles under which it is regulated the newest form of <b>European</b> <b>judicial</b> assistance in criminal matters, namely, the European Investigation Order in criminal matters. The examination is focused in particular on the necessity and importance of establishing this new form of legal assistance in criminal matters between the Member States, given that it will override the order of freezing property or evidence in the European Union. When examining the general principles of this form of assistance we have noticed some imperfections of the European law, therefore we have formulated some critical opinions, supplemented by proposals of de lege ferenda. At the same time, given that up to May 22, 2017 the European legal instrument {{will have to be}} transposed into the Romanian law, we have formulated some proposals of de lege ferenda aiming at the improvement of Law no. 302 / 2004 on international judicial cooperation in criminal matters, republished, as amended and supplemented. The innovations of the work regard the examination of the general principles set out in the Preamble of the European legal instrument, the importance and the necessity for adopting this regulation, as well as formulating critical opinions supplemented by appropriate proposals de lege ferenda. The current study follows other works in the international and <b>European</b> <b>judicial</b> cooperation in criminal matters domain, published in some national and foreign publishing houses and in the volumes of international or national scientific conferences.
