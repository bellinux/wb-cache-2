60|$|The Roberta {{tightened}} to her chains {{when the}} second head of the hurricane hit, as did schooner after schooner in swift succession. The sea, white with fury, boiled in tiny, spitting wavelets. The deck of the Malahini vibrated under the men's feet. The taut-stretched halyards beat a tattoo against the masts, and all the rigging, as if smote by some mighty hand, set up a wild thrumming. It was impossible to face the wind and breathe. Mulhall, crouching with the others behind {{the shelter of the}} cabin, discovered this, and his lungs were filled in an instant with so great a volume of <b>driven</b> <b>air</b> which he could not expel that he nearly strangled ere he could turn his head away.|$|E
60|$|Pericord leaned forward, {{his long}} sallow face quivering with excitement. His white nervous hands darted {{here and there}} among the wires. Brown stood impassive with {{critical}} eyes. There was a sharp burr from the machine. The huge yellow wings gave a convulsive flap. Then another. Then a third, slower and stronger, with a fuller sweep. Then a fourth which filled the barn with a blast of <b>driven</b> <b>air.</b> At the fifth the bag of bricks began to dance upon the trestles. At the sixth it sprang into the air, and would have fallen to the ground, but the seventh came to save it, and fluttered it forward through the air. Slowly rising, it flapped heavily round in a circle, like some great clumsy bird, filling the barn with its buzzing and whirring. In the uncertain yellow light of the single lamp it was strange to see the loom of the ungainly thing, flapping off into the shadows, and then circling back into the narrow zone of light.|$|E

50|$|MiTi {{has applied}} its {{technologies}} to rotating machinery systems with both domestic aerospace and major international companies. Developed oil-free systems have included motor <b>driven</b> <b>air</b> compressors for industrial use, cryogenic turboexpanders for generation of liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen, motor <b>driven</b> <b>air</b> blowers for automotive fuel cells, motor driven blowers {{for use in}} the food and beverage industries, small gas turbine engines for UAVs and microturbine generators for distributed electricity generation using either natural gas or renewable energy sources. While conducting these research programs and working to apply the technology to product, alternative bearing coatings and test machine products have resulted. New high temperature, long life and low friction coefficient coatings were developed to support the bearing product. Also, a new tribometer was developed to evaluate the friction, wear lubrication characteristics and life of solid lubricant coatings, shaft coatings and bearing performance under realistic operating conditions of high speed, high load and high temperature conditions.|$|E

50|$|The {{teardrop-shaped}} {{air knife}} has a bulbous plenum which tapers {{down to a}} precise air discharge slot as the standard of the blower <b>driven</b> <b>air</b> knife industry. Whereas a round pipe with holes drilled has an average coefficient of discharge of 0.6 (60% efficient), the teardrop-shaped air knife is commonly 0.95 (95% efficient), which provides much higher-impact air velocity to the surface at which the air is directed with the lowest blower motor power demand. These teardrop designs are available in extruded aluminum shapes as well as fabricated carbon and stainless steels.|$|E

The square tipped wing was straight edged, with slight sweep on the leading edge but none on the rear. Flaps stretched from the ailerons to the wing root on the trailing edge and there were hydraulically <b>driven</b> <b>air</b> brakes of the circular plate type.|$|E

The lab included a high-bay area that could accommodate a full-size gas turbine for testing and development purposes, as well as a large conference room and offices for the managers, engineers and technicians who operated the facility. It was sized to enable full-scale combustion testing, which required a large, a jet-derived gas turbine <b>driven</b> <b>air</b> compressor.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{dynamics}} of an acoustically <b>driven</b> <b>air</b> bubble in water. Depending on the values of external parameters, the radial oscillations of the bubble can be either stable or chaotic. The necessary condition of chaotic behaviour is identified to be the non-zero amplitude of the bubble's afterbounces {{at the beginning of}} the next acoustic cycle, which brings memory into the system. We show that for some parameter values in the chaotic regime the dynamics can be reduced to a unimodal map. At these parameter values the periodic orbit theory is successfully applied to calculate averages of relevant physical quantities, such as the air concentration at which the bubble is in diffusive equilibrium with the surrounding liquid. Finally we investigate the convergence of the calculated quantities...|$|E
