6000|$|I seem to {{remember}} my uncle taking to shopping quite suddenly. In the Beckenham days {{and in the early}} Chiselhurst days he was chiefly interested in getting money, and except for his onslaught on the Beckenham house, bothered very little about his personal surroundings and possessions. I forget now when the change came and he began to spend. Some accident must have revealed to him this new source of power, or some subtle shifting occurred in the tissues of his brain. He began to spend and [...] "shop." [...] So soon as he began to shop, he began to shop violently. He began buying pictures, and then, oddly enough, old clocks. For the Chiselhurst house he bought nearly a dozen grandfather clocks and three copper warming pans. After that he bought much furniture. Then he plunged into art patronage, and began to commission pictures and to make presents to churches and institutions. His buying increased with a regular acceleration. Its development {{was a part of the}} mental changes that came to him in the wild excitements of the last four years of his ascent. Towards the climax he was a furious spender; he shopped with large unexpected purchases, he shopped like a mind seeking expression, he shopped to astonish and dismay; shopped crescendo, shopped fortissimo, con molto espressione until the magnificent smash of Crest Hill eroded his shopping for ever. Always it was he who shopped. My aunt did not shine as a purchaser. It is a curious thing, <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>I</b> know not what fine strain in her composition, that my aunt never set any great store upon possessions. She plunged through that crowded bazaar of Vanity Fair during those feverish years, spending no doubt freely and largely, but spending with detachment and a touch of humorous contempt for the things, even the [...] "old" [...] things, that money can buy. It came to me suddenly one afternoon just how detached she was, as I saw her going towards the Hardingham, sitting up, as she always did, rather stiffly in her electric brougham, regarding the glittering world with interested and ironically innocent blue eyes from under the brim of a hat that defied comment. [...] "No one," [...] I thought, [...] "would sit so apart if she hadn't dreams--and what are her dreams?" ...|$|E

50|$|Extensive {{clinical}} studies established that HFM is <b>due</b> <b>to</b> (<b>i)</b> impaired intestinal absorption of folates and (ii) impaired transport of folates across the blood-choroid plexus-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier. Hence, patients with HFM have very low or undetectable folate blood levels. When a modest dose of a folate {{is given by}} mouth, there is impaired intestinal folate absorption without other signs of malabsorption. The CSF folate level is usually undetectable {{at the time of}} diagnosis. Even when the blood folate level is corrected, or far above normal, the CSF folate level remains low, consistent with impaired transport across the choroid plexus. The normal CSF folate level in children over {{the first three years of}} life is in the 75 to 150 nM range. In subjects with HFM it is very difficult indeed, rarely possible, to bring the CSF folate level into the normal range even with substantial doses of parenteral folate (see below).|$|E
50|$|Most commercially {{important}} conifers in Canada, including white spruce, are {{attacked by}} Inonotus tomentosus (Fr.) Teng {{also known as}} Onnia tomentosa (Whitney 1978). This fungus produces a white pocket rot commonly called Tomentosus root rot in both roots and butts of naturally seeded or planted conifers. White spruce and black spruce {{were found to be}} the 2 most susceptible species in an inoculation test in Saskatchewan (Whitney 1964), and high losses to root rot, in large part <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>I.</b> tomentosus, affected white spruce plantations at Grand-Mère QC (Lachance 1978). In white spruce plantations, mortality in groups of 2 or 3 trees usually occurs at about age 30-35 years (Whitney 1977), but younger trees can also be killed (Whitney 1993). Occasional trees as young as 10 years of age are infected (Whitney and Timmer 1983). Seventeen white spruce plantations 43-58 years old in Ontario incurred an average of 0.7% mortality annually over a 6-year study period (Whitney 1993). Average accumulated mortality of dominant and codominant trees was 10.3% for all plantations in that study. Tomentosus root rot was found in more than half the stumps after clearcutting in a plantation at Searchmont, Ontario, but decay and stain had not yet reached stump height (Whitney 1962).|$|E
5000|$|The {{posterior}} {{function is}} given by , i.e., the posterior function {{is proportional to the}} product of the likelihood function and the prior distribution, and can be understood as a method of updating information, with the difference between [...] and [...] being the information gain concerning [...] after observing new data. The choice of the prior distribution is used to impose restrictions on , e.g. , with the beta distribution as a common choice <b>due</b> <b>to</b> (<b>i)</b> being defined between 0 and 1, (ii) being able to produce a variety of shapes, and (iii) yielding a posterior distribution of the standard form if combined with the likelihood function [...] Based on the properties of the beta distribution, an ever-larger sample size implies that the mean of the posterior distribution approximates the maximum likelihood estimator The assumed form of the likelihood function is part of the prior information and has to be justified. Different distributional assumptions can be compared using posterior odds ratios if a priori grounds fail to provide a clear choice. Commonly assumed forms include the beta distribution, the gamma distribution, and the uniform distribution, among others. If the model contains multiple parameters, the parameter can be redefined as a vector. Applying probability theory to that vector of parameters yields the marginal and conditional distributions of individual parameters or parameter groups. If data generation is sequential, Bayesian principles imply that the posterior distribution for the parameter based on new evidence will be proportional to the product of the likelihood for the new data, given previous data and the parameter, and the posterior distribution for the parameter, given the old data, which provides an intuitive way of allowing new information to influence beliefs about a parameter through Bayesian updating. If the sample size is large, (i) the prior distribution plays a relatively small role in determining the posterior distribution, (ii) the posterior distribution converges to a degenerate distribution at the true value of the parameter, and (iii) the posterior distribution is approximately normally distributed with mean [...]|$|E

5000|$|One {{interesting}} story Christened regarding the steamer Лиза Чайкина was wrote by Sergei Vorobyov in Russian language as per story of [...] "granddad", ex-crewmember of this ship. The part of more interesting text from this story will translate here: Christened (The story of [...] "granddad") I started my {{job in the}} Far East in 1940s. I was signed on the old riveted steamer «Лиза Чайкина». When I joined the ship I was young alumnus of the Nautical College and was {{signed off on the}} staff assistant stoker. Operations are simple and the same as [...] "steamed turnip": it was necessary to feed the steam boiler with coal. During four hours you feed, eight hours in the rest. And, on the circle. Assistant task: to haul the coal to the furnace... Once my shiftworker, such a healthy [...] "ambal" [...] from Kohtla-Jarve, told me (due to he was Estonian, he uttered the letters D, G, B, V, Ch as T, K, P, F, T respectively and sometimes lost R): — Pefore we entrust the [...] "Montay" [...] to you, you hafe to pe tristenet, frient. Ant it will pe, as in the sonk: [...] "For a moment he saw a plintink likht, fell - the heat (heart) is not peatink any more." [...] As per jargon amongst the stokers, the [...] "Monday" [...] was a hefty scrap and not less than one pound of weight, which broke up slag in the furnace before cleaning the boiler. — So, I was christined, - I say - the grandmother told me that a poop christined me in the village when I was four years old. And his partner immediately corrected: — So, you was christined in the Orthodox faith to be believe in Christ. And here christen in Steamship faith. That you will believe in the power of steam else. It is tradition. Without it you will not survive here. Steam will pull all the juices from you. In short, come tomorrow in the engine room after the daily watch. There all [...] "the clear" [...] will gather in full team. That he meant the whole engine team of the glorious ship «Лиза Чайкина». [...] Next day, just after the watch, I climbed down in engine room and there all my [...] "oily belly buttons" [...] brethren headed by [...] "grand-dad", I means the chief engineer, and waiting. Standing grandly and important. [...] "Grand-dad" [...] wore a tunic with wide chevrons on the sleeves for the solemnity even. And, in hand of the second engineer I observed a big white enamel mug, which was filled with not the water, not the alcohol to the brim. But I did not know details of the christening. I was thinking, if it is alcohol, - the trumped deal, <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>I</b> did not drink alcohol also and could normally stand on my feet after the watch. The [...] "grand-dad" [...] came solemnly and shouted in my ear as it was noisly in the engine room due to motors run. However, the diesel engine is more noisly now. So, he shouts me: — Shura, we are now intend to christen you as per maritime tradition and then you will our spirit man, and no any contagion or trouble will not overtake you easy. For this reason we need to make two sacraments, or possible to say — to perform only two conditions: to kiss a crank bearing of the main engine and then drink a cup of seawater. Are you ready? — Ready - I reply. And, thank God, I will hope if it is not alcohol. [...] Regarding crank bearing should be discussed separately. The fact that steam engines connecting rods attached to the pistons, located outside, rather than inside as in modern engines, and they go into the cycle of the piston not reciprocates only, that is up and down, but also too much sweeping to the sides that you have look to avoid its [...] "elbow" [...] does not hurt you if you stand close. The crank bearing is in the lower joint of the elbow and this bearing needs to be lubricated constantly with the machine oil using the oilcans. It is required the highest category skill as a funnel for the pouring was on the rod, which is hopping a dance of death. And a oilcaner, so a motorman was called in that years, was involved unwittingly into the rhythm of this pagan dance, it was independs if he like it or not. And, oilcaner was crouching and twisting when he began to follow movement of the connecting rod, and at the right time he injected the right portion of the oil using big oilcan with a large down-curved nose (outlet pipe). One wrong move, - the oilcan could be striked by the connecting rod and the entire portion of the lubricant will be on your head. So motormen and engineers were unsurpassed dancers in this sense. They were virtuosos of the deal. It is marvel if you look at them from the side. The boogie-woogie is a pathetic parody regarding what they were doing. It is possible to say that their watch passed in the rhythm of this macabre ritual dance with the accompaniment of the romped monster. And an engineer contrives to determine the temperature of a crank some times during the watch also, thus he was controlling its possible overheating. He did it using own palm. A flat of the hand could safely withstand the temperature 70 degrees. And if the temperature is higher, then it begins to burn... Then I did not know all subtleties, but I felt that I encountered the situation. This bearing was dangerous to catch by hand, but here it was necessary to touch by the lips. I took the position. All engine valetry surrounded me, the second engineer was closest and indicate the direction me by the mug to the crank bearing in front of me. I thought: [...] "How long will I fit in? This crank will hits my teeth with the star effects exactly". I stretched my lips out {{in the form of a}} pipe as far as possible and began to approach the [...] "killer". And right now, unfortunately, swayed to the left side, well, and I suddenly kissed the iron elbow so much that my eyes darkened. I woke from a stupor, and immediately the mug was served to me. I swallowed a little water with salt, my eyes climbed up on my forehead, and it burns in my mouth. It turns out, that my two upper teeth had been knocked out and hurted, became painfully due to salt. I wanted to howl. So it turned out, that I did not know who kissed whom - or I kissed the crank bearing or the crank bearing kissed me. But I survived it fully. More finally my forehead was anointed with axle-grease and said to me: — Well, now you're christened as per all rules, and no any adversities will able to hurt you. We accept you into our brotherhood of steam, coal and axle-grease, and, be healthy. [...] And, indeed, after the christening my second breath opened, and the power came from nowhere. I was not tired as before, and was able to beat off and split the outgrowths of slag to pieces by the [...] "monday". I was accustomed to the heat conditions after a week, I did not want to get out from the boiler room. And the fact, that I was christened second time - apparently, this is not in vain, because during my second voyage such situation happened that only a miracle was able to save me.|$|E
