5000|$|A few larger <b>franchise</b> <b>consulting</b> {{firms have}} {{branched}} out themselves, essentially [...] "franchising" [...] their <b>franchise</b> <b>consulting</b> businesses. And industry publications such as Franchise Business Review and Entrepreneur regularly quote high performing franchise consultants as reliable article sources. High performing franchise consultants {{are those who}} have a past performance record of providing quality matches for clients and a high success rate of their clients. But buyer beware applies - many of these highly touted franchise consultants represent franchise companies that have little, if any, name recognition.|$|E
5000|$|Much like a {{real estate}} agent, the {{franchise}} [...] "recruitment consultant" [...] typically charges no upfront fees to [...] "buyers" [...] (franchisees); instead, he or she receives {{the bulk of his}} or her income from [...] "sellers" [...] (franchisers) and thus operates as a biased conduit between the two. It is important to understand that franchisors do not employ franchise consultants, but they do employ franchise brokers who call themselves franchise consultants. They establish relationships with these <b>franchise</b> <b>consulting</b> firms. The role of the franchise consultant is to build a win-win relationship between the franchisor and the potential franchisee. Quality <b>franchise</b> <b>consulting</b> firms that have a large footprint in the franchising industry and help screen out the franchises that don't meet the high standards that are set by franchise experts.|$|E

5|$|Next, Paramount {{sought to}} <b>consult</b> <b>franchise</b> creator Gene Roddenberry. He {{turned down the}} idea of running the show, given the time that {{production}} of The Original Series had distracted him from his family. But Paramount {{told him that it}} was impossible to pursue the new series otherwise, Roddenberry began to make plans for the series—with a new cast, as he wanted to avoid retreading and recreating the same roles now seen in the film franchise. Although they had not planned on it originally, Paramount hired Roddenberry to oversee the production and fired Strangis. However, one of his ideas appeared in the premise of The Next Generation, that the Federation and the Klingons had become allies. The first announcement of a new series was made by Roddenberry publicly on October 10, 1986.|$|R
50|$|In England, the {{setbacks}} that John (considered as illegitimate and as usurping {{the throne}} {{from his brother}} Richard the Lionheart) faced against the Dauphin (heir apparent) led city-dwellers in 1215 to impose the Magna Carta on the king, a charter that instituted liberty for the cities and parliamentary checks on royal taxation. In France the Capetians held onto their power while favoring the development of strong cities as a counterbalance to strong (often over-strong) nobles. Starting with Philip IV, this was done by favouring the development of villes franches (towns granted special <b>franchises),</b> and by <b>consulting</b> with legislative assemblies known as States-General for making important decisions. In fact, the royal domain was considerably extended {{and most of the}} dukedoms progressively became appanages entrusted to the king's sons, avoiding the progressive division of the Capetians' possessions.|$|R

500|$|Although {{the target}} {{audience}} of Burning Rangers was people who enjoyed action games, the developers also wanted to attract fans of other Sonic Team games. Ohshima stressed that he was aiming at a wider audience and {{not the type of}} person who only played Sonic the Hedgehog, adding that [...] "players should recognise the Sonic Team touch immediately" [...] with Burning Rangers. The working title was Firefighter, but it was dropped as the team wanted a [...] "cooler" [...] sounding name. Naka felt that [...] "burning" [...] had a [...] "go for it!" [...] connotation in Japanese, and fit with the disaster-rescue theme. He was initially unsure about having [...] "ranger" [...] in the title as he felt that a ranger referred to park rangers in western culture. The team thought that the image of a [...] "ranger" [...] also brought to mind the Power Rangers <b>franchise,</b> and after <b>consulting</b> speakers of other languages, Burning Rangers was chosen as the game's name.|$|R
