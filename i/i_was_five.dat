[...] He stated in 2009: [...] "I think the majority of my musical influences were set in stone when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>five</b> or six years old." [...] Lytle's vocals have drawn comparisons with Neil Young.|$|E
500|$|On September 17, 1999, Eminem's mother, Deborah Nelson, filed a $10 million {{lawsuit against}} him for slander {{based on his}} claim that she uses drugs in the line [...] "I just found out my mom does more dope than I do" [...] from [...] "My Name Is". After a two-year-long trial, she was awarded $25,000, of which she {{received}} $1,600 after legal fees. Eminem was not surprised {{that his mother had}} filed the lawsuit against him, referring to her as a [...] "lawsuit queen", and alleging that [...] "That's how she makes money. When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>five,</b> she had a job on the cash register at a store that sold chips and soda. Other than that, I don't remember her working a day in her life." [...] She later filed another lawsuit against him for emotional damages suffered during the first trial, which was later dismissed.|$|E

5000|$|White {{wine was}} {{exported}} to Rome; two dolia discovered in an excavation near Rome are marked, one [...] "I am a wine from Baeterrae and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>five</b> years old", the other simply [...] "white wine of Baeterrae". It {{was occupied by}} the Moors between 720 and 752.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know that," [...] replied Mary; [...] "but then I am {{not afraid}} of work any more than I am of lonesomeness. I began to work when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>five</b> years old, and I have worked ever since,--and I like it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Faith, Sir Gervaise, I {{never had}} any to forget. My father was a captain of a {{man-of-war}} before me, and he kept me afloat from the time <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>five,</b> down to {{the day of his}} death; Latin was no part of my spoon-meat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was afraid}} you had {{forgotten}} how to do it," [...] she laughed, when at last he released her. [...] "Do you know, you haven't hugged me, Dad, since <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>five</b> years old. That's nineteen years ago. You do love me, don't you?" ...|$|E
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>five</b> or six when {{my mother}} enrolls me in a dance school {{a few blocks from}} Sunnyside.

It seems to me that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> the only one who can't.|$|R
60|$|When {{not in a}} {{catalepsy}} {{of literary}} composition, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> essentially the man of action. I laid aside my novel for future reference, and we passed out of the paddock in the following order. First, Aunt Elizabeth, as fresh as paint, going well. Next, Bob, panting and obviously doubtful of his powers of staying the distance. Lastly, myself, determined, but wishing <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>five</b> years younger.|$|R
60|$|Before <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> <b>five</b> {{minutes in}} his company, Romayne {{asked me if}} I had seen Winterfield since his visit to Ten Acres Lodge.|$|R
6000|$|... "All {{comes of}} his gaining an Archer's place at such early years," [...] said Le Balafre; [...] "I never {{was so much}} talked of, fair nephew, because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>five</b> and twenty years old before I was hors de page [passed out of the rank of the page]." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, that's what I called it. I can't {{remember}} {{when there was}} not a 'ghost-room' in our house. As far back as when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>five</b> years old we had it, and I was just getting old enough to wonder about it when we moved to the city." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And it is a {{new thing}} to me, and a very dreadful one. I am fifty years old, and more; and since <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>five,</b> have gleaned the best hours of my life in the sun of spring and summer mornings; and I never saw such as these, till now.|$|E

2500|$|Contrary to {{rumors of}} [...] "six {{and a half}} feet," [...] Rachmaninoff's {{physical}} height is documented in repeated (10 November 1918 and 30 October 1924) U.S. Immigration manifests at Ellis Island as 6'-1". However, conductor Eugene Ormandy (who teamed with Rachmaninoff in many piano and orchestra performances) recalled in 1979: [...] "He [...] was about six feet-three. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>five</b> feet-five and a half..." [...] Therefore, Rachmaninoff's height would also {{not be considered a}} physical deformity or abnormality.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> had not <b>been</b> <b>five</b> minutes out, before I met my princely superintendent.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>five</b> {{years old}} {{the first time}} I got drunk. It was on a hot day, {{and my father was}} {{ploughing}} in the field. I was sent from the house, half a mile away, to carry to him a pail of beer. [...] "And be sure you don't spill it," [...] was the parting injunction.|$|E
6000|$|... “Yes, he {{died when}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>five</b> years old. He left a little money, and John Hammond {{took me in}} and bought a boat with that {{and what he had}} saved. I was bound to stay with him until I was {{fourteen}} years old, but was soon going to leave him, for he is really too old to go out any longer.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{mine for}} being the sort of woman <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>five</b> years ago.' She laughed bitterly. 'Woman! I {{was just a little}} fool, a sulky child. My {{punishment}} is going to be worse than yours, Peter. You will not be always thinking that you had the happiness of two lives in your hands, and threw it away because you had not the sense to hold it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have no {{ambition}} for promotion, for the present, Major. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> already <b>five</b> or six {{up among}} the senior lieutenants, {{which is quite}} high enough for one of my age." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you were}} more observant," [...] said Heyst with dispassionate contempt, [...] "you {{would have known}} before <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> <b>five</b> minutes {{in the room that}} I had no weapon of any sort on me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By hitting you a rap {{with this}} pine tree here," [...] shouted Antaeus, scowling {{so that he}} made himself the ugliest monster in Africa. [...] "I am fifty times {{stronger}} than you; and now that I stamp my foot upon the ground, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>five</b> hundred times stronger! <b>I</b> <b>am</b> ashamed to kill such a puny little dwarf as you seem to <b>be.</b> <b>I</b> will make a slave of you, and you shall likewise be the slave of my brethren here, the Pygmies. So throw down your club and your other weapons; and as for that lion's skin, I intend to have a pair of gloves made of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{determined}} to make it sure. When she left to-day, I started an hour ahead of her, and hid myself {{at the edge of}} the woods. An hour after the coach arrived at Indian Spring, she came there in a brown duster and was joined by him. I'd have followed them, but the d--d hound has the ears of a squirrel, and though <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>five</b> hundred yards from him he was on his guard." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] said Miss Lowery, beaming for a moment, [...] "it ain't {{as bad as}} that--there ain't any circumstances. It's {{the first}} time I've ever been in New York except once when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>five</b> years old, and I {{had no idea it}} was such a big town. And I met Mr.--Mr. Snip on the street and asked him about a friend of mine, and he brought me here and asked me to wait." ...|$|E
6000|$|Previously to quitting the {{province}} of Nova Scotia, my father placed Harriet and myself {{in the house of}} a Mr. Marchinton, to live. This gentleman was a clergyman, who had no regular parish, but who preached in a chapel of his own. He sent us both to school, and otherwise took charge of us. I am not aware of the precise time when the prince left Halifax, but it must have been when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>five</b> or six years old--probably about the year 1798 or 1799.[2] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} have already {{satisfied}} my curiosity. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> told <b>five</b> years ago that she was dead. It {{was because of the}} date of the photograph--two years later--that I ventured to intrude upon you. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> anxious only to know the truth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope he {{will not}} be wanting me to go {{straight}} off down there again," [...] Ralph said ruefully.

60|$|Why had I done it? Did I love her? It was so {{difficult}} to analyse love: and perhaps {{the mere fact that}} I was attempting the task was an answer to the question. Certainly I had never tried to do so five years ago when I had loved Audrey Blake. I had let myself be carried on from day to day in a sort of trance, content to be utterly happy, without dissecting my happiness. But <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>five</b> years younger then, and Audrey was--Audrey.|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess I'm {{a terrible}} hayseed," [...] she said between her little gulps and sighs, [...] "but I can't help it. G--George Brown and I were sweethearts {{since he was}} eight and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>five.</b> When he was nineteen--that was four years ago--he left Greenburg {{and went to the}} city. He {{said he was going to}} be a {{policeman}} or a railroad president or something. And then he was coming back for me. But I never heard from him any more. And I--I--liked him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No,' I said. 'It was not that. I can't let {{you even}} pretend {{you think that}} was all. I love you. I always have loved you, though I did not know how much till you had gone away. After a time, I thought I had got over it. But when I met you again down here, I knew that I had not, and never should. I came back to say good-bye, but I shall always love you. It is my {{punishment}} for being the sort of man <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>five</b> years ago.' ...|$|E
60|$|And {{here was}} the one thing I had not {{calculated}} on--myself. <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> <b>five</b> years in solitary. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> hideously weak. <b>I</b> weighed eighty-seven pounds. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> half blind. And <b>I</b> <b>was</b> immediately stricken with agoraphobia. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> affrighted by spaciousness. Five years in narrow walls had unfitted me for the enormous declivity of the stairway, for the vastitude of the prison yard.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lie back quite comfortably, and don't worry," [...] said Jane Hubbard. [...] "I'm {{going to}} my room to get a book to read you to sleep. <b>I</b> shan't <b>be</b> <b>five</b> minutes. And forget about your mother. I'll look after her." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{glad that}} the subject of figure {{training}} is under consideration, because so much nonsense is talked {{on the subject of}} tight-lacing. The fun of it is, all the condemnation comes from those who don't wear stays, either from men or from women with hobbies and without waists. All who have tried tight-lacing speak approvingly of it. I would not give up my well-made, tight fitting stays for anything. The sensation of being laced in tight is an enjoyable one that only those who have experienced it can understand. <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> in corsets ever since <b>I</b> <b>was</b> eight years of age, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> now past my teens, and though <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>five</b> feet four inches tall and broad in the shoulders, I only measure nineteen inches, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> in capital health.|$|R
