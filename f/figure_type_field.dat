The objectives were to share experience/lessons learned and together do some research in new concepts/architectures that involves the use of the US PIC 1. Since June 2002 the MOU project has developed a prototype system called Evacuation Support System (EvacSys). This system uses the PIC as an &quot;electronic field medical card &quot; and addresses the problems of capturing, storing and distributing medical treatment and patient tracking information during the evacuation of a wounded soldier from field. In order to have an efficient iterative development process and to document the benefits and improvements of EvacSys, a framework for testing and evaluation has been developed – namely the MIT-F. The MIT-F defines: • Why to test (rationale) • What tests can be performed (test <b>types)</b> <b>Figure</b> 1 <b>Field</b> medics performing and documenting treatment. • What documentation can be produced (test specification) • How to test (methodology...|$|R
