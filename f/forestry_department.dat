5|$|Conservation of {{the natural}} {{environment}} is well developed in the United Kingdom. There are various public sector organisations with {{an important role in}} the stewardship of the country's flora. Scottish Natural Heritage is the statutory body responsible for natural heritage management in Scotland. One of their duties is to establish National Nature Reserves. Until 2004 there were 73, but a review carried out in that year resulted in a significant number of sites losing their NNR status, and as of 2006 there are 55. The Forestry Commission in Scotland serves as the <b>forestry</b> <b>department</b> of the Scottish Government and is one of the country's largest landowners. The Joint Nature Conservation Committee is the statutory adviser to Government on UK and international nature conservation.|$|E

25|$|When the {{position}} of the state's forestry minister and office head of Baden's <b>forestry</b> <b>department</b> was to be reappointed, Köhler intentionally decided against a member of Hubertia and put Karl Philipp in {{the position}}. Karl Phillip represented the so-called young forestry school and was knows to be very critical of the old establishment in Baden's forstry departments. He made many enemies with his destructive critique and his dogmatic lopsidedness, especially with his predecessors.|$|E
25|$|This {{report and}} the catholic men {{mentioned}} for offices in forestry provide evidence that religions orientation of applicants did not influence hiring decisions in Baden's <b>forestry</b> <b>department.</b> Furthermore, {{there was not one}} of Hubertia's members within the ranks of the foresrty officers mentioned in Hasel's notes. Due to that, there was no verifiable connection between an applicant's religious orientation and his connection to the fraternity of Hubertia, when he ran for a public forestry office.|$|E
25|$|Chhattisgarh State {{is ranked}} as the 17th-largest tea-producing state in India. The districts of Jashpur and Surguja are {{favourable}} tea production areas. In Jashpur district, the first tea plantation, Brahmnishthajaya Sogara Ashram was established {{under the direction}} of Pujya Pad Gurupad. Tea production started after two years at the Sogara Ashram. A tea processing unit was established in Sogara Ashram and the unit name set as the Aghor Tea Processing Plant. The <b>forestry</b> <b>department</b> has also started a tea plantation motivated by the Sogara Ashram. In Surguja district, a tea nursery is being developed by the Margdarshan Sansthan Agriculture College in Ambikapur, Surguja.|$|E

This paper presents the results ofa study made by the purpose of seeing in what manner the mellipherous treesbelonging to Faget <b>Forestry</b> <b>Departments</b> ensure maintenance and productionharvesting for bee families from this area. The study was made during the periodof May 2006 and April 2007, on a 19712 hectares area, in which we recorded:forestry mellipherous trees identification, the surface occupied by each specie andthe blooming period, data that we used to calculate the amount of honey that canbe obtained and the number of bee families that can be kept in the area,respectively. Analyzing the data, we concluded that forestry mellipherous treesfrom Faget <b>Forestry</b> <b>Departments</b> can ensure in normal conditions, maintenanceand production harvesting for 3800 bee families...|$|R

25|$|In the 1980s, such {{socially}} responsible forestry {{was encouraged by}} state community forestry agencies. They emphasized such projects as planting wood lots on denuded communal cattle-grazing grounds to make villages self-sufficient in fuelwood, to supply timber needed {{for the construction of}} village houses, and to provide the wood needed for the repair of farm implements. Both individual farmers and tribal communities were also encouraged to grow trees for profit. For example, in Gujarat, one of the more aggressive states in developing programmes of socioeconomic importance, the <b>forestry</b> <b>department</b> distributed 200 million tree seedlings in 1983. The fast-growing eucalyptus is the main species being planted nationwide, followed by pine and poplar.|$|E
25|$|A {{few months}} after abandoning Zhenitba, the 29-year-old Mussorgsky was {{encouraged}} to write an opera {{on the story of}} Boris Godunov. This he did, assembling and shaping a text from Pushkin's play and Karamzin's history. He completed the large-scale score the following year while living with friends and working for the <b>Forestry</b> <b>Department.</b> In 1871, however, the finished opera was rejected for theatrical performance, apparently because of its lack of any 'prima donna' role. Mussorgsky set to work producing a revised and enlarged 'second version'. During the next year, which he spent sharing rooms with Rimsky-Korsakov, he made changes that went beyond those requested by the theatre. In this version the opera was accepted, probably in May 1872, and three excerpts were staged at the Mariinsky Theatre in 1873. It is often asserted that in 1872 the opera was rejected a second time, but no specific evidence for this exists.|$|E
25|$|The {{report on}} Duke Wiser, {{mentioned}} above, {{on the other}} hand confirms Hasels point of view: Duke von Wiser, who had been given administrative powers over the <b>forestry</b> <b>department</b> in Friedrichstal, {{had been a member of}} Hubertia since 1877. Krutina {{on the other hand}}, who originated the quoted report, was just as well a member of Hubertia. If one would assume that Kurtina sides with Wiser due to their connection within their common fraternity, then we should be able to deduct supportive words instead of criticism. What surprises though is that the report itself speaks in a critical, if not negative, tone where Krutina denies Wiser any passion for his work: He refers to him as a mediocre hunter, something that is unlikely to be said between friends portraying each other outside. If there would have been unfair connections between members of Hubertia, then Krutina's reporst would likely have resulted in a more positive view of Wiser and the situation.|$|E

500|$|By the mid-1920s, {{concerns}} were being {{raised about the}} ability of the area to maintain the supply of naturally grown mallet and by 1929, stands of the naturally grown mallet had almost disappeared. [...] So, between 1925 and 1962 mallet plantations were established under the management of the <b>Forestry</b> <b>Department</b> which, during the Depression, provided employment for sustenance workers who planted some 4,000hectares (9,900 acres) of mallet, starting near 'Lol Gray' lookout. In 1933, 50 forestry workers were employed in the plantations. [...] Seven steam trains and a sawmill supported the industry within the woodland. [...] Two dams - 'Lol Gray' and the 'Old Mill Dam' provided good quality water to run the trains, as well as domestic water supplies which were carted by train to nearby towns including Narrogin.|$|E
500|$|Brown was {{influenced}} by the Progressive movement as applied to business. He paid his workers above the prevailing wage, instituted safety programs, hired a doctor to care for loggers in the camps, and, prior to [...] modern workers' compensation laws, had the company pay for hospitalization of injured workers. [...] He also attempted to improve camp conditions for the workers by banning card games and requiring the loggers to take showers, but those particular reform efforts [...] "were not well received." [...] The Brown family took considerable interest in the city of Berlin. Various family members started a public kindergarten, built a community club with a gym, swimming pool, and bowling alley, provided soup to the sick, and gave Christmas presents to local children. [...] Brown himself helped found a number of civic and business self-help organizations including the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests, established in 1901; the New Hampshire Timberlands Owners Association, a fire-protection group established in 1910; and similar fire-protection groups in Maine and Vermont. He set up a series of effective forest-fire lookout towers, possibly the first in the nation, and by 1917 had helped establish a forest-fire insurance company. [...] In 1909, after helping draft the legislation creating New Hampshire's State <b>Forestry</b> <b>Department,</b> [...] he {{became a member of the}} New Hampshire Forestry Commission; and its chair from 1910 until 1952, playing a significant role in shaping the forestry practices and laws of the state. Brown also served on the boards of several industry groups, including the American Forestry Association, Society of American Foresters, Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, and the Forest Research Council.

30|$|Educational {{advances}} have developed {{in parallel with}} technological advances. As {{a growing number of}} forestry graduates are trained in geospatial technologies, forestry companies and government benefit from their skill sets. The number of <b>forestry</b> <b>departments</b> requiring a remote sensing class as part of their degree requirements rose by 5 % (from 75 % to 80 %) between 1988 (Sader et al. 1989) and 1998 (Sader and Vermillion 2000). The same studies showed that by 1998, 10 % of <b>forestry</b> <b>departments</b> included a GIS class in their curricula, up from 5 % in 1988. By the year 2000, nearly 50 % of forestry employers expected that recent graduates had been trained in GIS during their undergraduate education (Sample et al. 1999). A review conducted in 2012 for this research showed that of the 50 universities accredited by the Society of American Foresters, 94 % (47 universities) had a dedicated geospatial technology course in their undergraduate curriculum.|$|R
