5|$|Villages {{were usually}} {{concentrated}} around irrigation reservoirs to enable {{easy access to}} water for agriculture. Houses stood immediately below the reservoir embankment, between {{the water and the}} paddy fields below. This facilitated easy control of the water supply to the fields and also supported maintenance of domestic gardens for fruit and vegetable production. A village typically consisted of a cluster of dwellings, paddy fields, a reservoir, a grazing <b>ground,</b> <b>shift</b> crop reserves and a village forest. In areas of high rainfall, a perennial watercourse often took the place of the reservoir. Inland fishing was widespread during the Anuradhapura Kingdom period because of the numerous reservoirs. Although not entirely absent, sea fishing was not common during this period mainly because of the rudimentary nature of transporting sea fish to cities which were located far inland.|$|E
50|$|Landslides {{created by}} the {{earthquake}} were common throughout Vancouver Island. Land subsidence resulted from the earthquake, most commonly around shorelines on the Strait of Georgia. This included the bottom of Deep Bay which sank between 2.7 m and 25.6 m. These measurements were reported by the Canadian Hydrographic Service. Also, a 3 m <b>ground</b> <b>shift</b> occurred on Read Island. Ships throughout the region were affected, and those on board them during the earthquake described it as similar to having run over a sand bar or striking a rock. Undersea power lines were destroyed in the long narrow Alberni Inlet and {{near the city of}} Powell River. All lighthouse keepers in the surrounding area felt the earthquake, and experienced damage including shattered windows and smashed dishes. A tsunami struck the west coast of Texada Island with two waves, the first being 2 m high and the second 1 m high. The earthquake caused a landslide near Mount Colonel Foster. One fortunate occurrence allowed researchers afterward to review the effects of the earthquake: an aerial photographic survey of Vancouver Island had commenced in 1946, soon after the earthquake, and these photographs were eventually studied by a geoscientist in the late 1970s.|$|E

40|$|Å være part i en jordskiftesak er ikke noe som hender ofte i en persons liv. Det er dermed rimelig å anta at en prosess i rettssystemet kan oppleves belastende for de involverte partene. Forhandlinger, rettsmøter og det å stå som motpart til naboer og bekjente kan være tyngende. Opplevelsen vil være subjektivt individuell, avhengig av sakens art, omfang og kompleksitet, og den vil være avhengig av rettens opptreden i forhold til den enkelte part. Problemstillingen i denne oppgaven har vært å undersøke hvor fornøyde jordskifterettens tidligere brukere er med den behandlingen de fikk i sin sak. Det er altså selve rettsprosessen som er gjenstand for undersøkelsen i denne oppgaven. Det er også satt fokus på å avdekke hva som har betydning for grad av fornøydhet. Underproblemstillingene forsøker å avdekke dette ved å fremstille elementer jeg tror kan være utslagsgivende for en god eller dårlig prosess. Bruk av advokat, elementer i prosess og sluttproduktets betydning har vært særlige viktige elementer i denne sammenheng. Hvordan man opplever en vare eller tjeneste er betinget av hvilke forventninger man har forut for situasjonen man befinner seg i. Når man kontakter jordskifteretten, har man en antagelse om at man ønsker sin eiendom forbedret. Jordskifteretten er et organ som har lovfestet at man skal sørge for at ingen lider tap som følge av å være part i en jordskiftesak. Dermed kan ikke sak fremmes dersom det vil føre til en betydelig forverring i eiendommens tilstand. Domstolen skal så langt det er mulig sørge for flest mulig fornøyde grunneiere. Tjenester som holder høy kvalitet er viktig for domstolens rennommé. Partenes tilfredshet i prosessen er å forstå ut fra hvordan man opplever sin kontakt med domstolenes institusjonelle rammer som lovverk og retningslinjer for prosess. Fornøydhet med prosess undersøkes best ved å tilnærme seg de subjektene som selv har deltatt i en sak for jordskifteretten. Jeg har gjennomført en kvantitativ undersøkelse ved hjelp av spørreundersøkelser for å forsøke å avdekke parters opplevelse av prosess. Denne studien har fokusert på partenes opplevelse av prosessen i saker for jordskifteretten. Den har blant annet avdekket at dommerens personlige egenskaper og betydningen av å få et sluttprodukt de fleste er fornøyd med, viser seg å være avgjørende for hvordan de involverte opplever sitt møte med retten. At man tar hensyn til elementer som partene mener er viktige, og forklarer hvordan man går fram i prosessen viser seg også å være viktig for partene. 3 Selv om denne studien tar for seg rettsprosessen i saker for jordskifteretten, viser resultatene av spørreskjemaundersøkelsen at sluttproduktet er svært sentralt for opplevelsen av prosessen. Det er nærliggende å begrunne det med at det til syvende og sist er sluttproduktet den individuelle part sitter igjen med, og skal leve med, i etterkant av prosessen. Abstract Being a {{party in}} the Norwegian Land Consolidation Court is not {{something}} that happens often in a person's life. It is thus reasonable to assume that a process {{in the criminal justice system}} can be experienced stressful and burdensome for the parties involved, when you are negotiating and conducting legal meetings and standing as counterparty to neighbors and acquaintances. The experience may be individual, depending on the nature, scale and complexity of the case. The experience will also depend on the Court's performance in relation to each party in a case. The approach in this thesis has been to examine how satisfied the Court's previous parties are with the service they received in their case. It is the legal process that is the subject of the survey in this thesis. There is also a focus on uncovering what the premises are for the degree of satisfaction the customers are experiencing. In this thesis I will also attempt to uncover this by presenting elements I assume is important for a good or bad process. The use of law, elements of the process and the final product's significance, is particularly important in this context. How the customer experiences a product or service depends on the expectations one has of the situation one would put up with. When one customer makes a contact with the Land Consolidation Court, one has an assumption that one wants its property improved. The Land Consolidation Court is a authority that has statutory to make sure that no one suffers loss as a result of being party to a land swap case. The case cannot be promoted if it will lead to a significant deterioration in the property's condition. The Court shall work to ensure as many satisfied property owners as possible, and services that are of a high quality are important for the Court's reputation. The parties grade of satisfaction in a <b>ground</b> <b>shift</b> process is to understand in regard to how the customer experiences his or her contact with the courts institutional frameworks and the legal framework and guidelines for the process. How satisfied the customers are with the process is best examined by approaching the subjects who have participated in a land swap case. It's been carried out a quantitative study using questionnaires/surveys to attempt to get information about the parties` experience of the process. 5 This study has focused on the parties’ experience of the process in matters of the Land Consolidation Court. It has revealed that the judge's personal qualities and the importance of getting a final product most people are satisfied with, turns out to be crucial in regard to how they experience a land swap case. Taking into account the elements that the parties consider to be important and to explain how to go forward in the process turns out to be crucial for the parties. This study deals with the whole process in cases before the Land Consolidation Court. The thesis show that the outcome of the case is of great importance in any land swap case. It is after all the end product the individual party is left with and shall live with after the process is completed...|$|E
