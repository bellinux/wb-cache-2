It {{will serve as a}} reference for ozone absorption spectra required for the long-term remote sensing <b>of</b> atmospheric <b>ozone</b> in the Huggins bands. The comparison with commonly used absorption cross section data sets for remote sensing reveals a possible bias of about 2  %. This could partly explain a 4  % discrepancy between UV and IR remote sensing data and indicates that further studies will be required to reach the accuracy goal of 1  % in atmospheric reference spectra...|$|R
40|$|The {{possible}} {{relationship between}} diabetic autonomic neuropathy, circadian blood pressure changes, and echocardiographic parameters {{was investigated in}} 27 normotensive diabetic patients (10 with and 17 without autonomic neuropathy) who underwent 24 h noninvasive ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and M-mode echocardiographic recording. The two groups were comparable for age, sex, duration of diabetes, body mass index, and metabolic control. There {{were no significant differences}} in 24 h average and <b>diurnal</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> systolic, diastolic, or mean blood pressure. The percent changes from day to night of systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressures were significantly lower in diabetics with neuropathy than in those without (P <. 04 or less). Increased left ventricular mass index (LVMI) (135. 4 +/- 10. 2 v 102. 9 +/- 6. 3; P <. 005), septal wall thickness, and posterior wall width were observed in neuropathic patients. Fractional shortening, peak velocity of early left ventricular filling (E), peak velocity of late ventricular filling (A), and their ratio (E/A) were similar in the two groups. The increased LVMI we observed may represent a possible link between diabetic autonomic neuropathy, nocturnal blood pressure levels, and higher cardiovascular mortality rate...|$|R
40|$|I {{present an}} {{analysis}} of ozonesonde data {{with a focus on}} using these data to evaluate stratospheric models of transport and chemistry. Ozonesondes are the only instruments that provide year-round profiles <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> throughout the lowermost stratosphere for middle and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. I show vertical profiles and the annual cycle <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> at selected pressure levels and stations and use TOMS data to evaluate the spatial bias of the sonde stations with respect to zonal mean <b>values</b> <b>of</b> column <b>ozone.</b> Between 10 and 30 % <b>of</b> the <b>ozone</b> column is located between 100 hPa and the tropopause at middle and high latitudes, and this region drives much of the seasonal variation <b>of</b> the <b>ozone</b> column. The sonde data allow quantification of the buildup <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> in the lowermost stratosphere of the Northern Hemisphere in winter and of its loss in late spring and summer. The amount <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> between the tropopause and 100 hPA in the Northern Hemisphere decreases from 175 t [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Data {{referring}} to an approximately 8 -year period (1999 - 2007) are analyzed {{in order to}} estimate the trend of the daily maximum hourly <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> concentration at {{the east coast of}} central Greece, where the summer background ozone concentration is high. A Kolmogorov-Zurbenko filter is applied to remove the short-term component from the raw time series <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> and meteorological variables. Regression models are developed in order to produce meteorologically adjusted ozone time series, involving the noise-free temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed as independent variables. The analysis verifies that the meteorological adjustment provides better results on estimating ozone's trend, which is found to be increasing (alpha = 0. 001) with an annual rate of 1. 34 +/- 0. 07 mu g/m(3). This trend could mainly be attributed to policy and changes in the emissions <b>of</b> <b>ozone's</b> precursors. Additionally, the short-term component <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> concentration is also meteorologically adjusted {{and its impact on the}} trend is examined. The analysis shows that its contribution is of minor importance when the ozone trend is adjusted by temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed. Moreover, the sea breeze circulation system that is frequently developed in the area influences the short-term and seasonal ozone variation, and therefore, it should be taken into account when producing meteorologically adjusted time series. The study's conclusions could be exploited by environmental and agricultural authorities in order to develop their long-term strategies towards the air quality management...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe present {{observations}} <b>of</b> {{unusually high}} <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> and N 2 O {{in the middle}} stratosphere that were observed by the airborne submillimeter radiometer ASUR in the Arctic. The observations {{took place in the}} meteorological situation of a major stratospheric warming that occurred in mid-January 2003 and was dominated by a wave 2 event. On 23 January 2003 the observed N 2 O and O 3 mixing ratios around 69 ° N in the middle stratosphere reached maximum <b>values</b> <b>of</b> ~ 190 ppb and ~ 10 ppm, respectively. The similarities of these N 2 O profiles in a potential temperature range between 800 and 1200 K with N 2 O observations around 20 ° N on 1 March 2003 by the same instrument suggest that the observed Arctic airmasses were transported from the tropics by isentropic transport. Using a linearized ozone chemistry model along idealized trajectories at different altitudes transport times between about 3 and 7 days are estimated from the difference between the Arctic and tropical O 3 mixing ratios observed in this potential temperature range. PV distributions suggest that these airmasses did not stay confined in the Arctic region which makes it unlikely that this dynamical situation lead to the formation of dynamically caused pockets <b>of</b> low <b>ozone...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{based on the results of}} daily {{measurements}} (taken at 1 p. m.) of air temperature and wind velocity and average diurnal temperatures of the air at the height of 200 cm above the ground, taken during the period from 1 st November to 31 st March in the years 1960 / 1961 - 1999 / 2000. The data were gathered at the agro-meteorological station at Lipki near Stargard, situated in the central part of the Szczecin Lowlands. For the evaluation of bioclimatic conditions, the wind chill index (WCI) was used, with the scale of heat perception defined by Maarouf and Bitzos. The perception of weather conditions was assessed during winter and spring thaw and during thawless periods. The analysis showed that the <b>diurnal</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> WCI index varied from about 370 do 1523 W m- 2. This made it possible to classify the days of this period within three categories of heat perception: comfortable, cool and cold, and a dominating category of perception during atmospheric thaw, independently of its duration, is cold. The appearance of atmospheric thaw is connected with improvement of heat perception, which is mainly illustrated by a decrease in the frequency of cold days and an increase in the frequency of cool days...|$|R
