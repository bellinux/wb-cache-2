40|$|Objective—To {{determine}} whether Mycobacterium bovis {{can be transmitted}} from experimentally infected deer to uninfected in-contact deer. Animals—Twenty-three 6 -month-old white-tailed deer. Procedure—On day 0, M bovis (2 X 108 colony-forming units) was administered by intratonsillar instillation to 8 deer; 3 control deer received saline (0. 9 % NaCl) solution. Eight in-contact deer were comingled with inoculated deer from day 21. On day 120, inoculated deer were euthanatized and necropsied. On day 180, 4 in-contact deer were euthanatized, and 4 new incontact deer were introduced. On day 360, all in-contact deer were euthanatized. Rectal, oral, and nasal swab specimens and samples of <b>hay,</b> <b>pelleted</b> feed, water, and feces were collected for bacteriologic culture. Tissue specimens were also collected at necropsy for bacteriologic culture and histologic analysis. Results—On day 90, inoculated and in-contact deer developed delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions to purified protein derivative of M bovis. Similarly, new in-contact deer developed DTH reactions by 100 days of contact with original in-contact deer. Tuberculous lesions in in-contact deer were most commonly detected in lungs and tracheobronchial and medial retropharyngeal lymph nodes. Mycobacterium bovis was isolated from nasal secretions and saliva from inoculated and in-contact deer, urine and feces from in-contact deer, and <b>hay</b> and <b>pelleted</b> feed. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—Mycobacterium bovis is efficiently transmitted from experimentally infected deer to uninfected in-contact deer through nasal secretions, saliva, or contaminated feed. Wildlife management practices that result in unnatural gatherings of deer may enhance both direct and indirect transmission of M bovis...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} measure glucose and lac-tate absorption and metabolic interrelationships in lambs either switched gradually (experiment 1) or abruptly (experiment 2) from hay to a high concentrate diet. In experiment 1, seven lambs were given primed, continuous, 3 -hour infu sions of 2 -[3 H]glucose, U-[HC]L-lactateand para-aminohippuric acid (portal blood flow indicator) before and after switching from a <b>pelleted</b> <b>hay</b> to a <b>pelleted,</b> 85 % concentrate diet. Blood samples were collected at 20 -minute intervals during infusions. In experiment 2, four lambs were abruptly switched from a <b>pelleted</b> <b>hay</b> to an all-concentrate diet. Portal and arterial blood samples were collected before and up to 1 week after the diet switch. As a result of increased concentrate intake (experiment 1) net portal absorption and turnover of L-lactate and glucose increased. Percentage of glucose derived from L-lactate decreased.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{factors that affect}} the quality of wooden fuel pellets, from raw {{materials}} to pellet production process. Among the factors, raw materials compositions, mechanical durability, moisture contents, and particle size distribution were studied. Experimental raw materials of different percent weights were introduced to industrial fuel pellet production, micro-chips in part- 1 experiment and peat in part- 2 experiment. Pellets made from these experimental raw material mixtures were tested for their mechanical strength (also known as durability) according to Swedish standards SS 187180 in Part 1 experiment, and European Technical Specification CEN/TS 15210 - 1 in Part 2 Experiment. Moisture contents of these pellets were also determined. In part- 1 experiment, particle size distributions of raw materials and final micro- chips pellets were analyzed. Mapping of pellet production process, bio-energy combine power and heating plant integrated with pellet production were illustrated along with descriptions on major processes. Selected process parameters (i. e. feed rate, drying temperature, milling temperature, <b>pellet</b> <b>machine</b> temperature) for Part 2 experiment were extracted from an industrial program, PGIM signal explorer, and combine with experiment results, thereafter analyzed with statistical methods and by use of SIMCA-P program. The results show that more fresh chips in raw material mixtures give better mechanical strength for micro-chips pellets. For pellets with 80 % fresh chips and 20 % mature chips in raw materials composition, high durability came from low drying temperature and low feed rate. For peat pellets with 20 % peat and 80 % fresh chips in raw materials composition, high durability came from high drying temperature, high feed rate, relatively higher pellet moisture content and slightly lower <b>pellet</b> <b>machine</b> temperature. The high and low are relative and based on the experiment results. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
