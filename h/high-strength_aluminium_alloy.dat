SP treatment nearly doubled the cycles to failure at the higher applied stresses when compared to the untreated specimens. The fatigue limit of the SP-treated specimens increased to 218 MPa at 107 cycles.

40|$|Summary and Conclusions Many {{research}} {{groups around the}} globe take a direct route from failure undermonotonic loading to high cycle fatigue. Surprisingly, low cycle fatigue being a border phenomenon between the aforementioned failure phenomena, is often not considered. In the present thesis, the gap between failure under monotonic loading and HCF was closed by thorough LCF analyses. As a practically relevant material, the <b>high-strength</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> Al 2024 has been chosen. The SRµCT investigations have made it evident that micro-mechanics based porous plasticity damage models are not suitable for this particular alloy due to {{a high number of}} dense particles. The particles are arranged in continuous layers throughout the micro-structure. Studying the microstructure and fracture mechanisms, it can be safely stated that bigger inclusions in Al 2024 sheets and plates are responsible for damage initiation in the LCF regime. Al 2024 thick plate, due to its underlying manufacturing process develops precipitates {{in the middle of the}} plate, creating layers within. A transition of fracture mode, from surface to internal fracture, was observed with increasing plastic range in cyclic experiments. In an ordinary low cycle regime (40 - 200 cycles), a fatal crack is generated by the propagation and frequent coalescence of small surface cracks. Eventually, a mesocrack initiates from the surface of the specimen due to the presence of bigger intermetallics. For a 100 mm thick plate the S-direction has been found to be very brittle when compared to L and T-directions (rolling directions) respectively. Although there is a ductility observed, the resulting failure occurs without macroscopic softening. An identical response was also observed in 4 mm thin sheets. For allowing symmetric strain amplitudes (R = - 1) in such sheets, a oating antibuckling guide has been proposed which successfully prevents buckling at high compressive loading without affecting adversely the mechanical behaviour of the specimen. In summary, the material behaviour in S-direction can be characterised as neither completely brittle nor completely ductile. More precisely, plastic strain accumulation as damage driving process as well as small fatigue crack growth as brittle damage mechanism can be seen for LCF. This led to a conclusion that for modelling low cycle fatigue for these materials, a material model which incorporates both these effects (coupled ductile and brittle) was required. For that purpose, a phenomenological CDM approach was considered in the present thesis. In our earlier analyses in the past, only ductile damage was taken into account. However, since the microstructural arrangement of Al 2024, as observed in our experiments favour also brittle failure modes, a fully coupled ductile-brittle model has been proposed. While ductile damage has been modelled in a similar fashion as advocated formerly by other authors (see, e. g. Lemaitre & Desmorat (2005)), a novel approach was elaborated for brittle damage. In sharp contrast to the ductile damage model, material degradation can already evolve below the yield limit. Since early work on a large number of smooth and notched specimen demonstrated that wide variations in commercial aluminium alloys caused little or no detectable differences in fatigue strength, the novel coupled damage model is also applicable to a wider range of aluminium alloys. The material parameters necessary to use the proposed model can be easily obtained from a hysteresis loop test in order to determine the cyclic stress-strain curve. The predicted LCF lifetimes for A 12024 alloy are in good agreement the respect experiments verifying the underlying assumptions...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to {{describe}} and characterize the anisotropic flow and fracture behaviour of a <b>high-strength</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy.</b> To this end,  thick plates of AA 7075 -T 651 aluminium alloy have been tested. Different specimen geometries were used to investigate various stress states. Each specimen was machined in different directions of the plate to enlighten the anisotropy of the material. For all tests, the plastic flow exhibited a slight anisotropy while the failure strain and failure modes showed a very important dependence to the loading direction. A microstructure analysis of the virgin material was performed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and electron back-scatter diffraction to identify its texture, grain shape and particle distribution. A transmission electronic microscope analysis gave information of the precipitate free zones and their composition. Tensile tests were performed on smooth axisymmetric specimens under uniaxial tension. Tensile tests were also conducted on notched axisymmetric specimens of notch radii  and  to obtain higher stress triaxiality states. Shear tests were performed on butterfly specimens and compression tests were performed on cylindrical specimens. Fracture surface analyses were carried out by SEM to identify the failure modes, supported by the microstructure analysis. Based on the plastic anisotropy observed experimentally, the Yld 2004 - 18 p anisotropic yield function proposed by Barlat et al. (2005) was chosen to model the elasto-plastic behaviour of the AA 7075 -T 651 alloy. The plastic parameters were calibrated using seven in-plane uniaxial tensile tests, a compression test in the normal direction of the plate and a shear test in the rolling direction. Numerical simulations of all the experimental tests were performed using the anisotropic elasto-plastic model. Predicted stress-strain curves were in very good agreement with the experimental curves for all tests including the tensile tests on notched specimens, which were not used in the calibration of the model. The overestimation of predicted stress level, generally observed (e. g. by Wilson, 2002) with notched specimens and isotropic pressure independent yield function, was significantly decreased when taking into account anisotropy. The stress and strain states on elements where failure is experimentally observed were evaluated. The establishment of a failure locus (relation between failure strain and stress triaxiality) was also discussed. Analytical approaches were used to gain some insight of the failure process. First, the void growth approach proposed by Rice and Tracey (1969) was extended to an anisotropic matrix. Then, the usual localization criterion (Rice, 1976) was developed with various constitutive characteristics to account for the shape of the yield function, non-associative plastic flow, large deformations and thermo-mechanical couplings. For industrial applications, a phenomenological failure criterion based on “plastic work”, called the anisotropic extended Cockcroft-Latham (AECL), was proposed. The criterion was calibrated using the seven uniaxial in-plane tensile tests and the shear test performed in the rolling direction. Numerical simulations of all tests were, once again, performed accounting for plastic anisotropy. A parameter study was carried out to enlighten the influence of parameters such as the plastic anisotropy and the failure anisotropy. The predicted failure strain and failure modes were not accurate enough to give predictive capability to this failure criterion in all material tests. Finally, this anisotropic failure criterion was also used in numerical simulations of some impact tests on AA 7075 -T 651 plates with ogival and blunt projectiles. A thermoelasto-thermoviscoplastic model with anisotropic yielding was used and as for the material tests, a parameter study was performed. Ballistic limits were predicted and compared with the experimental results obtained by Børvik et al. (2010). It was found that the anisotropy of plastic flow and failure had almost no influence at very high impact velocities, while it had a substantial effect at impact velocities close to the ballistic limit. The introduced anisotropy was not found to improve the ballistic limit prediction for all cases, and also other parameters (e. g. yield shape, temperature coefficients and contact algorithms) have a prominent influence on the predicted ballistic limit. However, supported by experimental observations of non-axisymmetric failure modes (Pedersen et al., 2011), both the plastic anisotropy and the failure anisotropy are believed to be important ingredient of the constitutive model.

Shot peening improved the plain-fatigue properties of the 7010 alloy at high applied stresses and this improvement decreased as the applied stress was reduced. A reversed trend was observed in the 8090 alloy with shot peening being beneficial to the fatigue properties at low applied stresses and detrimental at high applied stresses. The poor resistance of the 7010 alloy to fretting-fatigue was eliminated by shot peening and this was again attributed to the residual compressive stress induced by the peening treatment.

Cr-Mn and Cr-Mn-Ni steels are also susceptible to intergranular corrosion following sensitization in the temperature range of 420°-850 °C. In the case of the austenitic stainless steels, when these steels are sensitized by being heated in the temperature range of about 520° to 800 °C, depletion of chromium in the grain boundary region occurs, resulting in susceptibility to intergranular corrosion.

ENA was performed by using current noise measurement under potentiostatic control. The effect of chromate inhibitors on the noise activity of the initial state of corrosion on Al 99. 5 is surprisingly negligible. This phenomenon is discussed in the paper. The intermetallics are preferred sites for the initiation of corrosion processes. The microstructure investigation has shown that technically pure aluminium has a small content of iron rich intermetallics (Al 3 Fe). The microstructure of the <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> (e. g. AA 2024 and AA 6013) is characterised {{by a number of}} intermetallic phases (e. g. Al 2 Cu, Al 2 CuMg, Mg 2 Si). Because of the small content of additional elements in Al 99. 5 the influence of intermetallics should be negligible. Therefore, the corrosion behaviour of Al 99. 5 can be considered as a reference for medium and <b>high-strength</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys.</b> On that score, {{it is very important to}} know the liability of Al 99. 5 against crevice corrosion.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the microstructural response of an age-hardenable, <b>high-strength</b> 7449 <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> to friction stir welding. Plates in the naturally aged (T 3) and over-aged (T 79) conditions were welded using two weld tool translation speeds. Maps of precipitate volume fraction and size {{were obtained by}} spatially resolved small-angle X-ray scattering over a cross-section of the welded plate, complemented by direct observations made by transmission electron microscopy. The spatial variations of precipitate volume fraction and size were assessed quantitatively for the characteristic zones of the welds, and supported by complementary hardness measurements. The effect of initial microstructure and welding speed, in particular in the heat-affected and thermomechanically affected zones, is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The nuclear, aerospace, naval {{and missile}} {{industries}} place emphasis on materials with high structural integrity and reliable performance {{so as to}} meet certain stringent requirements in service. Strength {{is not the only}} criterion for selection. Properties such as fatigue resistance. impact toughness and fracture toughness are equally important. Electroslag refining (ESR) has been used widely and successfully over the years for improving the fatigue resistance, creep resistance, impact strength and fracture toughness of steels and alloy steels. But application of ESR to <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> is only a recent endeavour. A <b>high-strength</b> aircraft <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> IS: 7670 was therefore chosen for studies on the fatigue strength and the impact and fracture toughness. The results indicate that the fatigue resistance is considerably improved after refining and that the impact strength and fracture toughness of the refined alloy are comparable with that of the unrefined alloy...|$|R
