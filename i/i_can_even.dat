[...] "We're actually working over a year ahead of time," [...] Callaghan says {{in an interview with}} Hollywood.com. He added [...] "We work so far ahead <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>even</b> tell you the finale the finale is a really cool episode called 'Roads to Vegas.' It's like a road show and Stewie and Brian teleport themselves to Las Vegas, but in the process [...] unknowingly create a duplicate of one another." [...] In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Callaghan recalled the scene in the episode where Brian and Stewie consider joint suicide the most difficult scene for him to write in 2012.|$|E
500|$|After {{speaking}} with her friend, Swift became deeply fixated {{on the idea}} of how tragic it would be for the person one loved to wed someone else. That night, Swift experienced a dream where one of her own ex-boyfriends married another girl. To her, this signaled that she had to compose a song about interrupting a wedding. In retrospect, she concluded, [...] "For me, I like {{to think of it as}} good versus evil. And this girl is just completely – just the evil one." [...] Swift entitled the album after [...] "Speak Now" [...] because it fit the album's concept, with each song being a different confession to a person. [...] "It's called Speak Now, and that pertains to the album as a concept and as an entire theme of the record more than <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>even</b> tell you," [...] she said. The song was released as a promotional single on October 5, 2010, as part of Countdown to Speak Now, an exclusive campaign launched by the iTunes Store. During the opening week of Speak Now, Swift performed [...] "Speak Now" [...] on the Late Show with David Letterman.|$|E
500|$|In a 60 Minutes {{interview}} on March 31, 2005, Fonda reiterated {{that she had}} no regrets about her trip to North Vietnam in 1972, {{with the exception of the}} anti-aircraft-gun photo. She stated that the incident was a [...] "betrayal" [...] of American forces and of the [...] "country that gave me privilege". Fonda said, [...] "The image of Jane Fonda, Barbarella, Henry Fonda's daughter ... sitting on an enemy aircraft gun was a betrayal ... the largest lapse of judgment that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>even</b> imagine." [...] She later distinguished between regret over the use of her image as propaganda and pride for her anti-war activism: [...] "There are hundreds of American delegations that had met with the POWs. Both sides were using the POWs for propaganda ... It's not something that I will apologize for." [...] Fonda said she had no regrets about the broadcasts she made on Radio Hanoi, something she asked the North Vietnamese to do: [...] "Our government was lying to us and men were dying because of it, and I felt I had to do anything that I could to expose the lies and help end the war." ...|$|E

500|$|Coach McKay had {{won four}} {{national}} championships while coaching at USC, {{and he never}} hesitated to express his lack of awe at the NFL. He earned enemies in the league with his dismissive comments and nonchalant attitude. The league liked to promote the games as having life-or-death significance, and were undercut by a coach who would make statements such as, “You draw Xs and Os on a blackboard and that’s not so difficult. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>even</b> do it with my left hand”. Such statements made the Buccaneers’ road more difficult, as a feeling grew around the league that McKay was a newcomer who needed to be taught a lesson. Linebacker Richard “Batman” Wood echoed those sentiments: “It was a brand-new organization. Who cared about us? They wanted to devastate us, beat us in the ground. And with coach McKay coming from college, they wanted to maybe even play us a little harder." [...] Examples given of opponents using McKay’s comments {{as an excuse to}} run up the score included the reverse that Denver ran late in a 48–10 victory, and the timeout that Chuck Fairbanks called {{at the end of the}} Patriots game to enable Steve Grogan to break the NFL record of season rushing touchdowns by a quarterback. One sports analyst had predicted that McKay’s lucrative contract would encourage opposing coaches to run up the score on the Buccaneers, to be able to demonstrate to their team owners that they were deserving of similar money.|$|E
2500|$|Researchers at the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University {{described}} Gamergate as a [...] "vitriolic {{campaign against}} Quinn that quickly morph into a broader crusade against alleged corruption in games journalism" [...] which involved considerable abuse and harassment of female developers and game critics. Concerns {{have also been}} raised when juxtaposing the behavior of Gamergate supporters with their claimed message: Dr. Kathleen Bartzen Culver, a professor and media ethics expert at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, wrote that while Gamergate supporters claimed {{to be interested in}} journalism ethics, their [...] "misogynistic and threatening" [...] behavior belied this claim. [...] "Much of the conversation—if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>even</b> call it that—has been a toxic sludge of rumor, invective, and gender bias. The irony comes from people who claim to be challenging the ethics of game journalists through patently unethical behavior." ...|$|E
2500|$|Colonel Adolfo Prada was {{appointed}} {{commander of the}} Army of the Centre, the communist commanders of the I, II and III Army Corps of the Army of the Centre were relieved, the PCE's newspaper Mundo Obrero was closed [...] and Casado ordered massive arrests of communist commissars and militants. Ironically, Casado's justification for the coup was that Negrín and the PCE wanted {{to carry out a}} Communist takeover – an identical justification to the Nationalist uprising that began the Civil War – but in fact, he rose against the government because he wanted to negotiate peace and believed that removing Negrín and the Communists was a precondition to negotiations with Franco. In addition to other assurances, the British government said to him that Franco would guarantee the lives of the Republicans. Casado had said to the commander of the Republican Air Force, Hidalgo de Cisneros: “I give you my word...that I can obtain better terms from Franco than Negrín ever can. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>even</b> assure you that they will respect our ranks.”.|$|E
