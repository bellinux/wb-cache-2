40|$|This paper studies multi-agent optimal {{contracting}} with cost synergies. model synergies as {{the extent}} to which effort by one agent reduces <b>his</b> <b>colleague’s</b> marginal cost of effort. An agent’s pay and effort depend on the synergies he exerts, the synergies <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> exert on him and, surprisingly, the synergies <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> exert on each other. It may be optimal to “over-work ” and “overincentivize” a synergistic agent, due to the spillover effect on <b>his</b> <b>colleagues.</b> This result can rationalize the high pay differential between CEOs and divisional managers. An increase in the synergy between two particular agents can lead to a third agent being endogenously excluded from the team, even if his own synergy is unchanged. This result has implications for optimal team composition and firm boundaries...|$|R

5|$|As {{early as}} the 1920s Antoine Lacassagne, using {{polonium}} provided by <b>his</b> <b>colleague</b> Marie Curie, showed that the element has a specific pattern of uptake in rabbit tissues, with high concentrations, particularly in liver, kidney, and testes. More recent evidence suggests that this behavior results from polonium substituting for its congener sulfur, also in group 16 of the periodic table, in sulfur-containing amino-acids or related molecules and that similar patterns of distribution occur in human tissues. Polonium is indeed an element naturally present in all humans, contributing appreciably to natural background dose, with wide geographical and cultural variations, and particularly high levels in arctic residents, for example.|$|E
