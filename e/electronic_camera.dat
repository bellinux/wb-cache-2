25|$|Meanwhile, Vladimir Zworykin {{was also}} experimenting with the {{cathode ray tube}} to create and show images. While working for Westinghouse Electric in 1923, he began to develop an <b>electronic</b> <b>camera</b> tube. But in a 1925 demonstration, the image was dim, had low {{contrast}} and poor definition, and was stationary. Zworykin's imaging tube never got beyond the laboratory stage. But RCA, which acquired the Westinghouse patent, asserted that the patent for Farnsworth's 1927 image dissector was written so broadly that it would exclude any other electronic imaging device. Thus RCA, {{on the basis of}} Zworykin's 1923 patent application, filed a patent interference suit against Farnsworth. The U.S. Patent Office examiner disagreed in a 1935 decision, finding priority of invention for Farnsworth against Zworykin. Farnsworth claimed that Zworykin's 1923 system would be unable to produce an electrical image of the type to challenge his patent. Zworykin received a patent in 1928 for a color transmission version of his 1923 patent application, he also divided his original application in 1931. Zworykin was unable or unwilling to introduce evidence of a working model of his tube that was based on his 1923 patent application. In September 1939, after losing an appeal in the courts and determined to go forward with the commercial manufacturing of television equipment, RCA agreed to pay Farnsworth US$1 million over a ten-year period, in addition to license payments, to use Farnsworth's patents.|$|E

The stunts were co-ordinated by Terry Leonard, who had worked on many films, including Milius' previous projects and Steven Spielberg's Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981). Leonard said that Schwarzenegger, Bergman, and Lopez performed most of their own stunts, including the fights.|$|E

500|$|She was {{particularly}} affectionate towards the latter because it {{allowed her to}} appear on camera with her two children, {{and said it was}} her favorite. Certain elements of Rand's characterization were developed by Whitney and Shatner; Whitney would go to Shatner's side when their characters were put in danger – in response, Shatner would put his arms around her, such as in [...] "Balance of Terror". The character was written out of the episode [...] "Dagger of the Mind", which Whitney attributed to the romantic liaison that Kirk has with the female lead in that episode being so overt that it would have caused issues for later plots. This was because the script had Kirk and the female lead sleep with each other. Although Whitney found it difficult to watch as her character had been removed from the episode, she understood why. Part of her outfit was dictated by attempting to increase the duties of the Captain's Yeoman on screen. In order to provide support while part of an away team on a planet, Roddenberry suggested that she could wear a device on an over-the-shoulder strap which she could use as an <b>electronic</b> <b>camera.</b> He also suggested immediately that it could be expanded in order to be sold as a toy for young girls. This was part of the development process that {{led to the creation of}} the tricorder.|$|E

Malin was told [...] "Viking had already taken all the pictures we ever needed of Mars." [...] Malin thought that position was absurd. (Interview, Space.com 6/2000). Malin and Ed Danielson, a friend from Caltech days, jointly thought up a camera which {{would be able to}} resolve objects 6.5 feet across. NASA was not very interested but, in 1985, they gave Malin and Danielson $50,000 {{to come up with a}} proposal. Their design was telescope mated to an <b>electronic</b> <b>camera.</b> The camera was approved, and Malin now had to build it.|$|E
50|$|Telecines {{that use}} a {{monochrome}} CRT {{as the light}} source {{can be referred to}} as flying-spot scanners.

BBC News won the BAFTA for its actuality coverage, however the event has become remembered in television terms for Brian Hanrahan's reporting where he coined the phrase [...] "I'm not allowed to say how many planes joined the raid, but I counted them all out and I counted them all back" [...] to circumvent restrictions, and which has become cited as an example of good reporting under pressure.|$|E
2500|$|Wave {{function}} collapse is {{a forced}} expression for whatever just happened {{when it becomes}} appropriate to replace the description of an uncertain state of a system by {{a description of the}} system in a definite state. [...] Explanations for the nature of the process of becoming certain are controversial. At any time before a photon [...] "shows up" [...] on a detection screen it can only be described by a set of probabilities for where it might show up. When it does show up, for instance in the CCD of an <b>electronic</b> <b>camera,</b> the time and the space where it interacted with the device are known within very tight limits. However, the photon has disappeared, and the wave function has disappeared with it. In its place some physical change in the detection screen has appeared, e.g., an exposed spot in a sheet of photographic film, or a change in electric potential in some cell of a CCD.|$|E

50|$|With {{traditional}} film cameras, a long {{exposure is}} a single exposure, whereas with <b>electronic</b> <b>cameras</b> a long exposure {{can be obtained by}} integrating together many exposures. This averaging also permits there to be a time-windowing function, such as a Gaussian, that weights time periods {{near the center of the}} exposure time more strongly. Another possibility for synthesizing long exposure from multiple-exposure is to use an exponential decay in which the current frame has the strongest weight, and previous frames are faded out with a sliding exponential window.|$|R

50|$|The F-mount has a {{significant}} degree of both backward and forward compatibility. Many current autofocus F-mount lenses {{can be used on}} the original Nikon F, and the earliest manual-focus F-mount lenses of the 1960s and early 1970s can, with some modification, still be used to their fullest on all professional-class Nikon cameras. Incompatibilities do exist, however, and adventurous F-mount users should consult product documentation in order to avoid problems. For example, many <b>electronic</b> <b>camera</b> bodies cannot meter without a CPU enabled lens, the aperture of G designated lenses cannot be controlled without an <b>electronic</b> <b>camera</b> body, and non-AI lenses (manufactured prior to 1977) can cause mechanical damage to later model bodies unless they are modified to meet the AI specification. Many manual focus lenses can be converted to allow metering with consumer Nikon bodies by adding a Dandelion chip to the lens.|$|E

50|$|Synaptic Interface {{screenless}} video {{does not}} use light at all. Visual information completely bypasses the eye and is transmitted directly to the brain. While such systems have only been implemented in humans in rudimentary form - for example, displaying single Braille characters to blind people - success has been achieved in sampling usable video signals from the biological eyes of a living horseshoe crab through their optic nerves, and in sending video signals from <b>electronic</b> <b>cameras</b> into the creatures' brains using the same method.|$|R
40|$|This {{effort is}} a study of image-compression {{algorithms}} for an <b>electronic</b> still <b>camera.</b> An <b>electronic</b> still <b>camera</b> can record and transmit high-quality images {{without the use of}} film, because images are stored digitally in computer memory. However, high-resolution images contain an enormous amount of information, and will strain the camera's data-storage system. Image compression will allow more images to be stored in the camera's memory. For the <b>electronic</b> still <b>camera,</b> a compression algorithm that produces a reconstructed image of high fidelity is most important. Efficiency of the algorithm is the second priority. High fidelity and efficiency are more important than a high compression ratio. Several algorithms were chosen for this study and judged on fidelity, efficiency and compression ratio. The transform method appears to be the best choice. At present, the method is compressing images to a ratio of 5. 3 : 1 and producing high-fidelity reconstructed images...|$|R
