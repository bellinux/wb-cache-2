5|$|Conservapedia's {{article on}} {{evolution}} presents evolution as a naturalistic theory that lacks support and that conflicts with <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> {{the fossil record}} that creationists perceive to support creationism.

5|$|A 2013 book {{researched}} by James Taylor counters {{the popular}} {{belief that the}} Leete design was an influential recruitment tool during the war.

Though the image of Kitchener (Britain's most popular soldier) inspired several other poster designs, Taylor says he can find no <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> photographs {{of the time that}} the Leete poster was used, although a photograph from 15 December 1914 taken at the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway station in Liverpool clearly depicts Leete's depiction among other recruiting posters.|$|E

5|$|A central {{organizing}} {{concept in}} biology is that life changes and develops through evolution, {{and that all}} life-forms known have a common origin. The theory of evolution postulates that all organisms on the Earth, both living and extinct, have descended from a common ancestor or an ancestral gene pool. This universal common ancestor of all organisms {{is believed to have}} appeared about 3.5 billion years ago. Biologists regard the ubiquity of the genetic code as definitive <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> favor of the theory of universal common descent for all bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes (see: origin of life).|$|E
