40|$|The co-translational {{insertion}} of polypeptides into endoplasmic reticulum membranes may be initiated by cleavable amino-terminal insertion signals, {{as well as}} by permanent insertion signals located at the amino-terminus or in the interior of a polypeptide. To determine whether the location of an insertion signal within a polypeptide affects its function, possibly by affecting its capacity to achieve a loop disposition during its insertion into the membrane, we have investigated the functional properties of relocated insertion signals within chimeric polypeptides. An artificial gene encoding a polypeptide (THA-HA), consisting of the luminal domain of the influenza hemagglutinin preceded by its amino-terminal signal sequence and linked at its carboxy-terminus to an intact prehemagglutinin polypeptide, was constructed and expressed in in vitro translation systems containing microsomal membranes. As expected, the amino-terminal signal initiated co-translational {{insertion of}} the hybrid polypeptide into the membranes. The second, identical, interiorized signal, however, was not recognized by the signal peptidase and was translocated across the membrane. The failure of the interiorized signal to be cleaved may be attributed {{to the fact that it}} enters the membrane as part of a translocating polypeptide and therefore cannot achieve the loop configuration that is thought to be adopted by signals that initiate insertion. The finding that the interiorized signal did not halt translocation of downstream sequences, even though it contains a hydrophobic region and must enter the membrane in the same configuration as natural stop-transfer signals, indicates that the HA insertion signal lacks essential elements of halt transfer signals that makes the latter effective membrane-anchoring domains. When the amino- terminal insertion signal of the THA-HA chimera was deleted, the <b>interior</b> <b>signal</b> was incapable of mediating insertion, probably because of steric hindrance by the folded preceding portions of the chimera. Several chimeras were constructed in which the interiorized signal was preceded by polypeptide segments of various lengths. A signal preceded by a segment of 111 amino acids was also incapable of initiating insertion, but insertion took place normally when the segment preceding the signal was only 11 -amino acids long.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} collaborative work in interior decoration {{undertaken by the}} French architects Charles Percier (1764 - 1838) and Pierre-François-Léonard Fontaine (1762 - 1853), in order to argue that their shared aesthetic positioned the interior at the crux of a modem architectural discourse no longer dependent upon a Vitruvian theory of the orders. Percier and Fontaine's influential decoration book, the Recueil de décorations intérieures (1801 - 1812) serves as my {{point of departure for}} investigating their idea of interior decoration and its engagement with the complex cultural milieu of France, circa 1800, {{from the end of the}} ancien régime to the rise of a militarized empire under Napoleon Bonaparte. Approaching Percier and Fontaine's interior decoration partnership from different thematic angles, this interdisciplinary study demonstrates their vital role in shaping the unexpected contours of modem architectural thought. Against the widespread revolutionary destruction of monuments, ornament, rather than the orders, ensured architecture's survival. Percier and Fontaine's vision of the <b>interior</b> <b>signaled</b> a movement away from an architecture of monumentality towards one of mobility, a shift precipitated by the violence of political events, the disciplinary pressure of engineering and the emergence of new conceptions of history. Scholars have argued that the utilitarian techniques of engineering constituted the primary impetus behind the formation of a post-Vitruvian building culture in France. By contrast, Percier and Fontaine reaffirmed architecture's alliance with sculpture, painting and engraving, harnessing these artistic forms to new ends in their design practice. Through the Recueil, Percier and Fontaine claimed the interior-untouched by the spatial symbolics of the revolution-as architectural theory's proper terrain. Yet their publication simultaneously presented a fragile discourse of fragments, in which architecture was subject to the vagaries of fashion, commerce and history. Percier and Fontaine turned to their experiences designing theater sets in order to construct settings that would legitimize Napoleon's military conquests, beginning with the bellicose motifs at the château de Malmaison. Although the architects sought to colonize the interior as a site of Napoleonic power, it proved to be a porous and itinerant site of meaning that could not be claimed as the central domain of imperial force-or architecture alone. by Iris Moon.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{interaction}} between the shear layer over a circular cavity and the flow-excited acoustic response of the volume to shear layer instability modes. Within the fluid-resonant category of cavity oscillation, most research has been carried out on rectangular geometries and where cylinders are considered, side branch and Helmholtz oscillators are most common. In these studies, focus is generally restricted to either longitudinal standing waves or to Helmholtz resonance. In practical situations however, where the cavity is subject to a range of flow speeds, many different resonant mode types may be excited. The current work presents a cylindrical cavity design where Helmholtz oscillation, longitudinal resonance and also azimuthal acoustic modes may all be excited upon varying the flow speed. Experiments performed show how lock-on between each of the three fluid-resonances and shear-layer instability modes can been generated. A circumferential array of microphones flush mounted with the internal surface of the cavity wall was used to decompose the acoustic pressure field into acoustic modes and has verified the excitation of higher order azimuthal modes by the shear layer. One of these <b>interior</b> pressure <b>signals</b> was also used to provide a phase signal for averaging flow field measurements of the shear layer acquired using PIV.

The decadal SSH signals in the 1990 s were dominated by an increasing trend in the 30 °– 50 °S band and a decreasing trend in the central South Pacific Ocean poleward of 50 °S. In recent years since 2002 {{there has been a}} reversal in both of these trends. Spatially varying low-frequency SSH signals are also found in the tropical region of 10 °– 25 °S where the decadal SSH trend is negative in the eastern basin, but positive in the western basin. To clarify the causes for these observed spatially varying SSH signals, a 11 ⁄ 2 -layer reduced-gravity model that includes the wind-driven baroclinic Rossby wave dynamics and the responses forced by SSH changes along the South American coast was adopted. The model hindcasts the spatially varying decadal trends in the midlatitude and the eastern tropical regions well. Accumulation of the wind-forced SSH anomalies along Rossby wave characteristics is found to be important for both previously reported long-term trends and their reversals in recent years. The boundary forcing associated with the time-varying SSH signals along the South American coast is crucial for understanding the observed SSH signals of all time scales in the eastern tropical South Pacific basin, but it has little impact upon the midlatitude <b>interior</b> SSH <b>signals...</b>|$|R

To facilitate {{the understanding of the}} observed changes, a two-layer ocean model was adopted that includes first-mode baroclinic Rossby wave dynamics and barotropic Sverdrup dynamics. The NPC intensified steadily over the T/P period from 1992 to 1998. Much of this intensification is due to the persistent sea surface height (SSH) drop on the northern side of the NPC. A similar SSH trend is also found in the interior of the Alaska gyre. Both of these SSH changes are shown {{to be the result of}} surface wind stress curl forcing accumulated along the baroclinic Rossby wave characteristics initiated from the eastern boundary. In addition to the <b>interior</b> SSH <b>signals,</b> the intensity of the Alaska gyre is shown to depend also on the SSH anomalies along the Canada/Alaska coast, and these anomalies are shown to be jointly determined by the signals propagating from lower latitudes and those forced locally by the alongshore surface winds. The WSG changed interannually from a zonally elongated gyre in 1993 – 95 to a zonally more contracted gyre in 1997 – 99. This structural change is due to the interannual SSH anomalies within the WSG as a result of the baroclinic Rossby wave adjustment attenuated by eddy dissipation. Along the western boundary of the subpolar North Pacific, variability of the East Kamchatka Current (EKC) and Oyashio is in balance with that of the interior Sverdrup flow on the annual and year-to-year timescales.

In the last two decades numerous records of oxygen isotopes have been collected to assess plant ecological changes, understand terrestrial paleoclimate, and to determine the surface history of mountain belts. The δ¹⁸(O) values of these records, in general, increase from the mid-Miocene to the Recent. We suggest that these records record an increase in aridity and expansion of grasslands in midlatitude continental regions. We use a nondimensional isotopic vapor transport model coupled with a soil water isotope model to evaluate the role of vapor recycling and transpiration by different plant functional types. This analysis shows that increased vapor recycling associated with grassland expansion along with biomechanistic changes in transpiration by grasses themselves conspires to lower the horizontal gradient in the δ¹⁸(O) of atmospheric vapor as an air mass moves into continental <b>interiors.</b> The resulting <b>signal</b> at a given inland site is an increase in δ¹⁸(O) of precipitation with the expansion of grasslands and increasing aridity, matching the general observed trend in terrestrial Cenozoic δ¹⁸(O) records.

RT-PCR analysis showed weak, but wide, expression of filamin-Bvar- 1 and a similar splice variant of filamin-A (filamin-Avar- 1) in human tissues. Furthermore, alternative splice variants of filamin-B and filamin-C, from which the flexible hinge- 1 region is deleted (DeltaH 1), were induced during in vitro differentiation of C 2 C 12 mouse myoblasts. We show that both filamin-Avar- 1 and filamin-Bvar- 1 bind more strongly than their wild-type isoforms to different integrin beta subunits. The mere presence of the high-affinity binding site for beta 1 A is not sufficient for targeting the filamin-Bvar- 1 construct to focal contacts. Interestingly, the simultaneous deletion of the H 1 region {{is required for the}} localization of filamin-B at the tips of actin stress fibers. When expressed in C 2 C 12 cells, filamin-Bvar- 1 (DeltaH 1) accelerates their differentiation into myotubes.

The model reproduces the main features of the Black Sea circulation, including the river discharge effects on the mean sea level and the Bosphorus outflow. Model results show that the simulated sea surface elevation increases in spring over the whole sea, reaching a maximum in the Danube delta area. In the same region, a minimum is observed in winter. The amplitude of the seasonal oscillations (about 8 - 12 cm over the whole basin) is of the same order of magnitude as the maximum horizontal variations (about 15 - 18 cm between the coastal areas and the basin <b>interior).</b> This strong <b>signal</b> formed mostly by river discharges, along with the seasonal variability in the other forcing functions and the local dynamics creates a well-pronounced interannual variability. The performance of the model in simulating the seasonal and interannual variability is critically analyzed, with a special attention on the cold intermediate water formation and the circulation in the upper 150 m. The simulations demonstrate that the source of intermediate waters is on the shelf, and that the water mass in the core of cold intermediate layer changes with time {{as a response to the}} periodic forcing at sea surface.

40|$|The {{secretion}} of glucocorticoids {{from the}} adrenal gland is necessary for appropriate metabolism, immune regulation and responses to stress exposure. Glucocorticoid secretion occurs with defined patterns sensitive to physiological or pathological state, and communicates detailed messages to the cellular <b>interior.</b> These <b>signals</b> are conveyed {{in part by the}} genomic actions of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a ligand-activated transcription factor modifying the transcriptome by interacting with DNA. Little attention has been afforded to how GR-mediated genomic signalling interacts with the defined pattern of glucocorticoid secretion in vivo, or the varied physiological contexts in which glucocorticoid secretion occurs. In {{the first part of the}} thesis the dynamics of GR interaction with the pattern of hormone presentation is explored. Well recognised circadian glucocorticoid secretion comprises high amplitude pulses of adrenal secretory activity with an ultradian frequency (approximately one pulse/hr). The importance of the ultradian component of this secretion pattern, conserved through mammalian evolution has been previously suggested by detailed studies revealing an influence of physiological and pathophysiological state on rhythm components. By scrutiny of other systems possessing ultradian rhythms, we hypothesised a functional significance to the ultradian pattern of glucocorticoid release. The emerging hypothesis that ultradian secretion is important for appropriate gene regulation was examined. Utilising chromatin immunoprecipitation to define GR occupancy of endogenous gene regulatory regions, we describe a dynamic interaction of the GR with DNA binding sites in cell lines and animal tissues. GR responded individually to pulses of glucocorticoid exposure, and interacted with the genome in a manner defined temporally by ligand availability. The effect of this behaviour on the output of known glucocorticoid-regulated genes is discussed, incorporating the work of colleagues and collaborators using DNA binding ELISA and quantitative RT-PCR. The transcriptional program facilitated by this mode of interaction can be described as 'gene pulsing'. The second part of the thesis addresses context-dependence III glucocorticoid signalling [...] Context -dependant behavioural and physiological responses to glucocorticoid likely anse through context-dependent molecular events. Access of transcription factors to DNA of higher organisms is controlled by the chromatin environment and by the availability of other transcription factors, which can either permit or hinder binding site accessibility. We hypothesised that the population of accessible binding sites for GR genome-wide is not absolute or fixed in any given cell type. Rather, changes in the chromatin landscape could arise from signalling components activated by stimulus exposure. Such changes may permit focused targeting of GR to DNA in a manner appropriate to the context of glucocorticoid exposure. Utilising the rodent response to stress as a context different from a baseline quiescent state, we designed experiments to test whether an equivalent elevation in plasma corticosterone produces the same genome-wide pattern of GR binding regardless of context (null hypothesis). Our approach depends upon high throughput sequencing technology to define regions of enriched GR binding determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis (ChIP-seq). The thesis presents the experimental approach incorporating available preliminary data but does not address the hypothesis directly at this stage. Our results necessitate a revision of the classical view of glucocorticoid receptor function at the genome and hint at how the transcriptional program generated by GR's episodic association with the genome might be disrupted in human disease. A review of the clinical use of glucocorticoids, and the current approach to novel glucocorticoid therapeutics may be warranted. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Though transit peptides are necessary and sufficient for guiding nuclear-encoded preproteins into the chloroplast interior, the nature of sequence information of transit peptides is not fully understood due to their high divergence in length and composition. Over the last nine years, the number of proteins known or predicted to reside in the chloroplast outer envelope membrane of Arabidopsis has tripled to one hundred and seventeen. Although the functions {{for some of these}} outer envelope proteins (OEPs) have been characterized, the precise mechanism of their targeting to the chloroplast outer membrane has not been fully elucidated. Besides Toc 75, the targeting mechanisms used by OEPs that have been characterized do not involve an N-terminal transit peptide. The bioinformatics tool ChloroP can be used to predict if amino acid sequences contain an N-terminal transit peptide. Recently, ChloroP analysis and protoplast transient expression assays were used to identify a novel chloroplast targeting signal in the C-terminus of the chloroplast preprotein receptor Toc 159 in Bienertia sinuspersici (Lung and Chuong, 2012). Toc 159 was also shown to lack a canonical transmembrane domain typically present in OEPs. While the unique C-terminal targeting sequence has been partially characterized in Toc 159 (Lung et al., 2014), it left open the question of whether this type of signal is unique to Toc 159, or if it is used by other OEPs as well. In the current study, to determine if other OEPs use this novel targeting pathway, ChloroP analysis identified eight potential candidates possessing the putative C-terminal targeting signal in Arabidopsis. Transient protoplast expression assays have been performed on OEP 18, the protein predicted with the highest ChloroP score, to determine its subcellular localization and the sequences required for its targeting to chloroplasts. The primary purpose of the current study was to establish whether chloroplast outer membrane proteins other than Toc 159 use a similar C-terminal targeting signal. Overall, the data in this thesis suggest that some OEPs other than Toc 159, such as OEP 18, may use this novel targeting pathway...|$|R

AD patients develop a gradual and progressive decline in cognitive and functional abilities as well as behavioral and psychiatric symptoms, eventually leading to a vegetative state and ultimately death. In 1907, Dr. Alois Alzheimer published the first report linking the clinical features of AD to plaque and tangle neuropathology. Neurofibrillary tangles in the brain consist primarily of hyperphosphorylated tau. Neuritic plaques consist primarily of aggregated amyloid β (Aβ) peptides and are surrounded by dystrophic neurites, microglia, and reactive astrocytes. Plaques are increasingly viewed as tombstones, and do not correlate well with cognitive impairment. The progressive accumulation of soluble β-amyloid (Aβ) in vulnerable brain areas with aging does parallel the progressive dementia found in AD patients. Plaques are not considered to be responsible for the initial impairments. Therefore, reduction of Aβ is currently the leading approach of experimental therapies for AD. Purification and sequencing of Aβ from AD brain led to the cloning of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene and triggered research on trying to understand how the age-dependent accumulation of Aβ in the brain leads to the downstream pathologies and progressive dementia. Aβ is generated by two sequential cleavages of APP by β- and γ-secretases, two major forms of Aβ are produced, a long one with 42 amino acids, Aβ 42, and a shorter one with 40 amino acids, Aβ 40. Aβ 42 is more hydrophobic; it easily aggregates and associates to membranes, likely facilitating its retention intracellularly. Aβ 40 is more soluble and is mostly secreted. In 1993, the first biochemical evidence for appreciable levels of endogenous intracellular Aβ was reported in vitro. In 2000, with the development of antibodies that differentiated Aβ 42 peptide from its precursor, it was reported that Aβ 42 accumulated intracellularly in neurons even before plaque formation. Since then, several studies have implicated the accumulation of Aβ within neurons as important for AD pathogenesis. Loss of synapses occurs early in AD and is considered the best pathological correlate of cognitive decline. Several lines of evidence suggest a relationship between Aβ accumulation and synaptic dysfunction. Depressed synaptic transmission, including impaired LTP (long-term potentiation), has been reported in AD mouse models of β- amyloidosis, and occurs concomitantly with the appearance of intraneuronal Aβ accumulation even prior to appearance of extracellular plaques. This observation suggests that the intracellular accumulation of Aβ 42 may have an important role in AD pathogenesis, especially in the initial stages of the disease. Tg 2576 mice harbor the human APP transgene with the familial AD Swedish mutation and develop AD-like cerebral amyloidosis. Aβ accumulates and oligomerizes within neurons of Tg 2576 mice with aging in vivo, especially within neuronal processes and synaptic compartments. To study the cell biology of Aβ-dependent neuronal dysfunction, we turned to cultured neurons from Tg 2576 mice. Tg 2576 neurons were previously characterized to recapitulate the accumulation of Aβ with time in culture. We set out to better characterize the consequences of this aberrant Aβ 42 accumulation on synapses. In this study, we found both structural and functional alterations in pre- and postsynaptic compartments in Tg 2576 compared to wild-type neurons at 19 days in vitro (DIV). The presynaptic alterations included reductions in the number of active presynaptic compartments and in the levels of synaptophysin, a synaptic vesicle protein. The postsynaptic alterations included reductions in the levels of the glutamate receptor subunit, GluR 1, and of the postsynaptic density protein, PSD- 95. Since Aβ 42 accumulation progresses with time in culture, at 19 DIV there is higher concentration of Aβ 42 with more probability of aggregation and oligomerization than at 12 DIV. We hypothesized that the changes at 19 DIV could correspond to a more severe phenotype paralleling a later stage of disease. Therefore, we studied synapses at 12 DIV in Tg 2576 compared to wild-type neurons. Presynaptically there was no difference in the number of active compartments or in the levels of synaptophysin however, postsynaptically spines were reduced. Specifically, the postsynaptic changes included reduction in the levels of PSD- 95 and of glutamate receptors subunits GluR 1 and NR 1 at the postsynaptic density but not in total cellular lysates. These results suggest that early on the alterations at synapses are due to an impaired trafficking of glutamate receptors. The glutamate receptors are critical determinants for LTP and long-term depression (LTD), forms of synaptic plasticity thought to be involved in the establishment of new memories. Our results shed light on the consequences of Aβ acumulation on synapses, specifically on the earliest alterations that lead to synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline in AD. However, although we found Aβ 42 to be responsible for the synaptic alterations in Tg 2576 neurons, the mechanism whereby Aβ 42 affects synapses needs further clarification. Over the past few years, increasing evidence supports that intraneuronal Aβ accumulation is involved in early AD pathogenesis. Although the precise location(s) of Aβ production in neurons remains controversial, the subcellular site of Aβ 42 accumulation in AD is better accepted. Aβ 42 accumulation in the brains of Tg 2576 mice and human AD occurs especially in multivesicular endosomes (MVBs). Alterations in the endocytic pathway are among the earliest pathological changes in AD. The molecular mechanisms by which abnormalities in the endocytic pathway arise and are involved in the pathogenesis of AD remain unknown. In the brain, Aβ 42 - accumulating MVBs often localize close to degenerating synapses. Since Aβ 42 accumulation with aging occurs in the outer limiting membranes of MVBs, we hypothesized that this accumulation could alter the MVB sorting pathway in neurons. MVBs are vesicular organelles morphologically defined by a limiting membrane and characteristic inner vesicles. MVBs are considered to be late endosomes, formed by maturation of early endosomes by membrane invaginations that generate inner vesicles with an acidic pH. The inner vesicles have a different content of lipids and proteins: they are rich in cholesterol, LBPA (lysobisphosphatidic acid) and lysosomal glycoproteins. MVBs are involved in many cellular functions, including the regulated trafficking of several proteins and membrane receptors. The trafficking of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to MVBs has been the most extensively studied. EGFR upon stimulation with EGF is internalized into early endosomes. The EGF-EGFR complex is stable at the pH of early endosomes, and therefore the activated receptor follows the MVB pathway. During endosomal maturation, inward invagination of the outer membrane leads to MVB formation and traps receptors in the MVB <b>interior,</b> terminates <b>signaling</b> and promotes their subsequent degradation in the more acidic environment of inner vesicles of MVBs and lysosomes. In neurons, the functional role of MVBs is less well understood. MVBs are thought to have an important role in retrograde transport, carrying receptors from neuronal terminals to the cell body for signaling and/or degradation in lysosomes. For example, neurotrophin receptors after ligand binding are internalized presynaptically and transported in MVBs to the cell body where signaling to the nucleus can occur, thereby preventing the loss of signaling during transport. The sorting of neurotrophin receptors to MVBs has been described for TrkB, which upon brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) activation is quickly removed from the cell surface by endocytosis and delivered to the MVB sorting pathway. Since Aβ 42 accumulates especially in the outer limiting membrane of MVBs with AD pathogenesis, we postulated that this could impair MVB sorting. We set out to study the MVB sorting pathway in cultured Tg 2576 neurons following the trafficking of EGFR after EGF binding, which is well characterized. We demonstrated that Aβ accumulating Tg 2576 neurons revealed normal internalization and recycling but altered MVB sorting of EGFR upon activation. The accumulation of EGF-EGFR in MVBs of Tg 2576 compared to wild-type neurons suggested reduced degradation of EGFR. We verified altered MVB sorting and degradation of another ligand-receptor complex, BDNF-TrkB, which provided similar results. To obtain more information on the trafficking of EGFR within MVBs, we assessed the levels of phosphorylated EGFR (P-EGFR), since dephosphorylation is thought to occur at the low pH of the inner vesicles of MVBs, and found elevated P-EGFR in Tg 2576 neurons. These data suggested impairment in the trafficking of EGFR within MVBs that accumulate Aβ 42. Ubiquitination is required for trafficking of EGFR to MVBs, subsequent translocation within MVBs, and later degradation of EGFR via the MVB sorting pathway. It was therefore possible that reduced ubiquitination of EGFR might be blocking EGFR from translocating to inner MVB membranes. Instead, we found increased ubiquitin conjugated EGFR in Tg 2576 neurons, suggesting that ubiquitination of EGFR was not impaired. Therefore, we hypothesized that deubiquitination activity might be compromised. Analysis of deubiquitinating enzyme activity did reveal reduced deubiquitination in Tg 2576 neurons, although the modest change seemed insufficient for the more marked elevation in ubiquitinated EGFR. Considerable evidence over the past few years has|$|R
