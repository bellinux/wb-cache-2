Synchrotron emission pervades the Galactic plane at low radio frequencies, originating from cosmic ray electrons interacting with the Galactic magnetic field.

40|$|We have {{successfully}} developed {{a method for}} fabricating scandate-based thermionic emitters in thin film form. The primary goal of our effort is to develop thin film emitters that exhibit low work fimction, high intrinsic <b>electron</b> <b>emissivity,</b> minimum thermal activation properties {{and that can be}} readily incorporated into a microgap converter. Our approach has been to incorporate BaSrO into a SqOq matrix using rf sputtering to produce thin films. Diode testing has shown the resulting films to be electron emissive at temperatures as low as 900 K with current densities of 0. 1 mA. cm- 2 at 1100 K and saturation voltages. We calculate an approximate maximum work function of 1. 8 eV and an apparent emission constant (Richardson's constant, A*) of 36 mA. cm- 2. K- 2. Film compositional and structural analysis shows that a significant surface and subsurface alkaline earth hydroxide phase can form and probably explains the limited utilization and stability of Ba and its surface complexes. The flexibility inherent in sputter deposition suggests alternate strategies for eliminating undesirable phases and optimizing thin film emitter properties...|$|E
40|$|The {{floating}} {{potential of a}} probe, emitting a sufficiently high electron current, yields a fairly accurate approximation of the plasma potential. This is an advantage {{in comparison to the}} conventional Langmuir probe where, after determination of the electron temperature Te, the plasma potential can only be derived indirectly from the formula Vpl = Vfl + aTe, where a {{is a function of the}} ratio of the electron to the ion saturation currents (a is around 2. 4 in a magnetised hydrogen plasma). In addition, an emissive probe also works if there are electron drifts or beams in the plasma. Emissive probes are usually realised by small directly heated loops of W-wire. Drawbacks of this design are the limited lifetime, the low <b>electron</b> <b>emissivity</b> of W and the voltage drop across the wire. We have developed a new type of emissive probe, which is heated by an infrared high-power diode laser with a maximum output power of 50 W. The probe consists of a small cylinder of LaB 6. The probe was inserted into the edge region of the VINETA helicon discharge plasma. Basic features of emissive probes were verified.

40|$|Since {{the mass}} of the {{electron}} is very small relative to atomic masses, Thomson scattering of low-energy photons (hν≪ m_ec^ 2) produces thermal Doppler frequency shifts that are much larger than atomic Doppler widths. A method is developed here to evaluate the <b>electron</b> scattering <b>emissivity</b> from a given radiation field which is considerably faster than previous methods based on straightforward evaluation of the scattering integral. This procedure is implemented in our multilevel radiative code (MALI), which now takes full account of the effects of noncoherent electron scattering on level populations, {{as well as on the}} emergent spectrum. Calculations using model atmospheres of hot, low-gravity stars display not only the expected broad wings of strong emission lines but also effects arising from the scattering of photons across continuum edges. In extreme cases this leads to significant shifts of the ionization equilibrium of helium.

Very recent developments which {{are relevant to}} the underlying plasma physics are emphasized. In particular, the identity of the submegahertz emissions as fundamental, or second harmonic, the degree of correlation between <b>emissivities,</b> <b>electron</b> streams, and plasma (Langmuir) waves, paradoxes concerned with the time-ordering of these phenomena, and the role of background density irregularities and ion-acoustic turbulence in the solar wind, are discussed.

40|$|Crystalline diamond {{coatings}} and, increasingly, diamond-like {{amorphous carbon}} (DLC) films {{are used for}} tribological and protective layers for their hardness and chemical inertness. They are also under investigation for their electron emitting properties, with possible applications in field emission displays. In this study, hydrogen-free DLC films were deposited by laser ablation using a KrF excimer laser and fluences between 0. 5 and 2 J/cm 2. Information about the disorder and short range order in the films was gained via Raman spectra. As the ratio of graphitic and diamond bonds (sp 2 and sp 3) is often hidden in these measurements, other analytical methods have to be included. XPS spectra exhibit for certain films the presence of sp 3 bonds or graphitic growth. For a better determination of the sp 3 -content, a correlation with optical properties in the near IR to near UV region was established. These values depended strongly on the substrate temperature and the laser fluence. DLC formation with large sp 3 contents could be demonstrated without substrate heating. Vickers hardness values and measurements on the <b>electron</b> <b>emissivity</b> of the films are strongly correlated to the sp 3 content and the preparation method of the films.

Using a low-frequency radio telescope, the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), we measure the free-free absorption of this Galactic synchrotron emission by intervening HII regions {{along the line of}} sight. These absorption measurements allow us to calculate the Galactic cosmic-ray <b>electron</b> <b>emissivity</b> behind and in front of 47 detected HII regions in the region 250 ^∘ < l < 355 ^∘, |b| < 2 ^∘. We find that all average emissivities between the HII regions and the Galactic edge along the line of sight (ϵ_b) are in the range of 0. 24 ∼ 0. 70 K pc^- 1 with a mean of 0. 40 K pc^- 1 and a variance of 0. 10 K pc^- 1 at 88 MHz. Our best model, the Two-circle model, divides the Galactic disk into three regions using two circles centring on the Galactic centre. It shows a high emissivity region near the Galactic centre, a low emissivity region near the Galactic edge, and a medium emissivity region between these two regions, contrary to the trend found by previous studies.

40|$|Spacecraft surface {{charging}} {{can lead}} to arcing {{and a loss of}} electricity generation capability in solar panels or even loss of a satellite. The charging problem may be further aggravated by atomic oxygen (AO) exposure in Low Earth orbits, which modifies the surface of materials like polyimide, Teflon, anti-reflective coatings, cover glass etc, used on satellite surfaces, affecting materials properties, such as resistivity, secondary <b>electron</b> <b>emissivity</b> and photo emission, which govern the charging behavior. These properties are crucial input parameters for spacecraft charging analysis. To study the AO exposure effect on charging governing properties, an atomic oxygen exposure facility based on laser detonation of oxygen was built. The facility produces AO with a peak velocity value around 10 - 12 km/s and a higher flux than that existing in orbit. After exposing the polyimide test material to the equivalent of 10 years of AO fluence at an altitude of 700 - 800 km, surface charging properties like surface resistivity and volume resistivity were measured. The measurement was performed in a vacuum using the charge storage decay method at room temperature, which is considered the most appropriate for measuring resistivity for space applications. The results show that the surface resistivity increases and the volume resistivity remains almost the same for the AO exposure fluence of 5. 4 × 1018 atoms cm- 2...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA new {{generation}} of Neutral Beam systems will be required in future fusion reactors, suchas DEMO, able to deliver high power (up to 150 MW) with high neutral energy (> 1 MeV). Negative ion beams can attain this performance, resulting in a strong research focus on negativeion production from either surface or volumetric plasma sources. A novel helicon plasma source, employing on a resonant birdcage network antenna, is currentlyunder study at the Swiss Plasma Center (SPC), before installation on the Cybele negativeion source [1] at CEA-IRFM. The source delivers up to 10 kW at 13. 56 MHz, and was installedon a linear (1. 8 m length) Resonant Antenna Ion Device (RAID). Passive spectroscopic measurementsof the Ha, Hb and Hg Balmer lines {{and of all the}} diagonal Fulcher-a bands were performedwith a sensitive f/ 2 spectrometer. Multiple viewing lines setup and an absolute intensitycalibration were used to determine the plasma radiance profile, with a space resolution < 3 mm. A minimum Fisher regularisation algorithm is then applied to calculate the absolute emissivityprofile for each emission line, in cylindrical symmetry as experimentally observed. An errorestimate of the Abel-inverted profiles was performed using a Monte Carlo approach. Finally, anRF-compensated Langmuir probe measured the electron temperature and density profiles.

The charging problem may be further aggravated by the atomic oxygen (AO) exposure in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), which modifies the surface of materials like, Polyimide, Teflon, anti-reflective coating, cover glass, etc., used on satellite surface. These affect material properties, such as resistivity, secondary <b>electron</b> <b>emissivity,</b> photo emission, which govern the charging behaviour. These properties are crucial input parameters for spacecraft charging analysis. This research develops a new facility at KIT, based on a novel technique for generating atomic oxygen flux involving laser induced breakdown of molecular oxygen. High velocity AO in an evacuated nozzle is formed, where laser beam breakdowns molecular oxygen into AO injected through a pressurized pulse valve into the nozzle. The energy of AO is measured using Time of flight (TOF) technique. The generated AO flux is measured using Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM). The Mass Flow Controller (MFC) inserted in oxygen gas supply line measures the net amount of gas being injected through pulse valve. The spectral analysis of AO production wavelength (777. 6 nm) is detected using a spectrometer. The relative abundance of generated species is observed using a Quadrupole Mass Analyzer System (QMAS). The developed facility produces AO of velocity 8 ～ 14 kms- 1 having the flux in the order of 1018 atoms/m 2 /shot. This flux is used to expose spacecraft surface materials for extended period of 10 years at 800 km, equivalent to exposure of satellite surface materials to atomic oxygen fluence for the normal lifetime of the satellite in orbit. This thesis develops a new method and facility for the measurement of resistivity of atomic oxygen exposed polyimide by using surface charge decay method. The resistivity measurement is performed in vacuum using the charge storage decay method at room temperature, which is considered most appropriate for measuring the resistivity for space application. The mathematical formulation and experimental facility are indigenously developed to measure resistivity as per space requirement. We introduce a new method to measure surface and volume resistivity together, which can be further improved to measure the secondary electron characteristics. The results show that the surface resistivity increases and the volume resistivity remains almost the same for the AO exposure fluence of 5. 4 x 1018 atoms cm- 2 on polyimide film. 九州工業大学博士学位論文 学位記番号:工博甲第 311 号 学位授与年月日:平成 23 年 3 月 25 日 1.

40|$|Fluorescent lamps are {{the most}} widely used {{artificial}} light source today, responsible for approximately 70 % of the lumens delivered to our living spaces globally. The technology was originally commercialized in the 1930 's, and manufacturers have been steadily improving the efficacy of these lamps over the years through modifications to the phosphors, cathodes, fill-gas, operating frequency, tube diameter and other design attributes. The most efficient commercially available fluorescent lamp is the 25 Watt T 5 lamp. This lamp operates at 114 - 116 lumens per watt while also providing good color rendering and more than 20, 000 hours of operating life. Industry experts interviewed indicated that while this lamp is the most efficient in the market today, there is still a further 10 to 14 % of potential improvements that may be introduced to the market over the next 2 to 5 years. These improvements include further developments in phosphors, fill-gas, cathode coatings and ultraviolet (UV) reflective glass coatings. The commercialization of these technology improvements will combine to bring about efficacy improvements that will push the technology up to a maximum 125 to 130 lumens per watt. One critical issue raised by researchers that may present a barrier to the realization of these improvements is the fact that technology investment in fluorescent lamps is being reduced in order to prioritize research into light emitting diodes (LEDs) and ceramic metal halide high intensity discharge (HID) lamps. Thus, it is uncertain whether these potential efficacy improvements will be developed, patented and commercialized. The emphasis for premium efficacy will continue to focus on T 5 lamps, which are expected to continue to be marketed along with the T 8 lamp. Industry experts highlighted the fact that an advantage of the T 5 lamp {{is the fact that it}} is 40 % smaller and yet provides an equivalent lumen output to that of a T 8 or T 12 lamp. Due to its smaller form factor, the T 5 lamp contains less material (i. e., glass, fill gas and phosphor), and has a higher luminance, enabling fixtures to take advantage of the smaller lamp size to improve the optics and provide more efficient overall system illuminance. In addition to offering the market a high-quality efficacious light source, another strong value proposition of fluorescent lighting is its long operating life. In today's market, one manufacturer is offering fluorescent lamps that have a rated life of 79, 000 hours - which represents 18 years of service at 12 hours per day, 365 days per year. These lamps, operated using a long-life ballast specified by the manufacturer, take advantage of improvements in cathode coatings, fill gas chemistry and pressure to extend service life by a factor of four over conventional fluorescent lamps. It should be noted that this service life is also longer (approximately twice as long) as today's high-quality LED products. The fluorescent market is currently focused on the T 5 and T 8 lamp diameters, and it is not expected that other diameters would be introduced. Although T 8 is a more optimal diameter from an efficacy perspective, the premium efficiency and optimization effort has been focused on T 5 lamps because they are 40 % smaller than T 8, and are designed to operate at a higher temperature using high-frequency electronic ballasts. The T 5 lamp offers savings in terms of materials, packaging and shipping, as well as smaller fixtures with improved optical performance. Manufacturers are actively researching improvements in four critical areas that are expected to yield additional efficacy improvements of approximately 10 to 14 percent over the next five years, ultimately achieving approximately 130 lumens per watt by 2015. The active areas of research where these improvements are anticipated include: (1) Improved phosphors which continue to be developed and patented, enabling higher efficacies as well as better color rendering and lumen maintenance; (2) Enhanced fill gas - adjusting proportions of argon, krypton, neon and xenon to optimize performance, while also minimizing the mercury dose; (3) Improved cathode coatings to enhance <b>electron</b> <b>emissivity</b> and extend lamp life; and (4) UV-reflective glass coatings deposited between the layer of phosphor and the glass tube, to reflect any UV light back into the phosphor layer for down-conversion...|$|E
