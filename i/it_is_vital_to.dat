While it is {{generally}} ignored during infantry-limited gameplay, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>vital</b> <b>to</b> the long-range use of the Crusader tanks {{and one of the}} missions in which the player must direct artillery fire to defend a town.

5|$|There {{are several}} defences to {{trespass}} to land; licence, justification by law, necessity and jus tertii. Licence is express or implied permission, {{given by the}} possessor of land, {{to be on that}} land. If a licence is lawfully revoked, a licence-holder becomes a trespasser if they remain on the land. Justification by law refers to those situations in which there is statutory authority permitting a person to go onto land, such as the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which allows the police to enter land for the purposes of carrying out an arrest. Jus tertii is where the defendant can prove that the land is not possessed by the claimant, but by a third party, as in Doe d Carter v Barnard. The exception to this defence is if the claimant is a tenant and the defendant a landlord who had no right to give the claimant his lease. Necessity is the situation in which <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>vital</b> <b>to</b> commit the trespass; in Esso Petroleum Co v Southport Corporation, the captain of a ship committed trespass by allowing oil to flood a shoreline. This was necessary to protect his ship and crew, however, and the defence of necessity was accepted.|$|E

The Apalachicola Bay provides 35 percent of the freshwater flow to the eastern Gulf of Mexico, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>vital</b> <b>to</b> the richly productive estuaries in this region. The key to the estuary is the fluctuation in salinity levels produced by the ACF's freshwater flow. A reduced flow of fresh water into these estuaries would result in higher salinity levels, that could endanger the marine life, including that supporting major seafood industries.|$|E
25|$|Before {{understanding}} Aristotle's {{views on}} dreams, first {{his idea of}} sleep must be examined. Aristotle gives an account of his explanation of sleep in On Sleep and Wakefulness. Sleep takes place {{as a result of}} overuse of the senses or of digestion, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>vital</b> <b>to</b> the body, including the senses, so it can be revitalized. While a person is asleep, the critical activities, which include thinking, sensing, recalling and remembering, do not function as they do during wakefulness. Since a person cannot sense during sleep they can also not have a desire, which {{is the result of a}} sensation. However, the senses are able to work during sleep, albeit differently than when a person is awake because during sleep a person can still have sensory experiences. Also, not all of the senses are inactive during sleep, only the ones that are weary.|$|E

25|$|Hermeneutic {{therapists}} use {{memory and}} imagination to envision others’ experiences in their minds. As they do, possibilities {{come to the}} mind of the therapist that might not present themselves to the client: possibilities for potential re-interpretation, healing, meaning, relating, and discovery (knowledge). It is for these reasons that hermeneuts consider imagination is so vital to not only reflexive development but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>vital</b> <b>to</b> therapists as an intersubjective tool to help promote growth in clients by bringing “to mind what is presently absent", which helps establish some stability to one's knowledge and, in turn, establish personal truth and meaning about a self and his or her experiences. Finally, the knowledge produced from imagination is only constitutive of a person's (client's) identity and experiences when that person marks that knowledge as meaningful to his- or herself, thus reinforcing the impact of co-created meaning in counseling.|$|E

2500|$|The {{objective}} of the resectioning surgery is to remove the epileptogenic tissue without causing unacceptable neurological consequences. [...] In addition to identifying and localizing the extent of epileptogenic zones, ECoG {{used in conjunction with}} DCES is also a valuable tool for functional cortical mapping. [...] <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>vital</b> <b>to</b> precisely localize critical brain structures, identifying which regions the surgeon must spare during resectioning (the “eloquent cortex”) in order to preserve sensory processing, motor coordination, and speech. [...] Functional mapping requires that the patient be able to interact with the surgeon, and thus is performed under local rather than general anesthesia. [...] Electrical stimulation using cortical and acute depth electrodes is used to probe distinct regions of the cortex in order to identify centers of speech, somatosensory integration, and somatomotor processing. [...] During the resectioning surgery, intraoperative ECoG may also be performed to monitor the epileptic activity of the tissue and ensure that the entire epileptogenic zone is resectioned.|$|E
2500|$|Dysthymia has {{a number}} of typical characteristics: low energy and drive, low self-esteem, and a low {{capacity}} for pleasure in everyday life. [...] Mild degrees of dysthymia may result in people withdrawing from stress and avoiding opportunities for failure. [...] In more severe cases of dysthymia, people may even withdraw from daily activities. [...] They will usually find little pleasure in usual activities and pastimes. Diagnosis of dysthymia can be difficult because of the subtle nature of the symptoms and patients can often hide them in social situations, making it challenging for others to detect symptoms. [...] Additionally, dysthymia often occurs {{at the same time as}} other psychological disorders, which adds a level of complexity in determining the presence of dysthymia, particularly because there is often an overlap in the symptoms of disorders. [...] There is a high incidence of comorbid illness in those with dysthymia. Suicidal behavior is also a particular problem with persons with dysthymia. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>vital</b> <b>to</b> look for signs of major depression, panic disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, alcohol and substance misuse and personality disorder.|$|E

2500|$|Information {{reconciliation}} {{is a form}} {{of error}} correction carried out between Alice and Bob's keys, in order to ensure both keys are identical. It is conducted over the public channel and as such <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>vital</b> <b>to</b> minimise the information sent about each key, as this can be read by Eve. A common protocol used for information reconciliation is the cascade protocol, proposed in 1994. This operates in several rounds, with both keys divided into blocks in each round and the parity of those blocks compared. If a difference in parity is found then a binary search is performed to find and correct the error. If an error is found in a block from a previous round that had correct parity then another error must be contained in that block; this error is found and corrected as before. This process is repeated recursively, which {{is the source of the}} cascade name. After all blocks have been compared, Alice and Bob both reorder their keys in the same random way, and a new round begins. At the end of multiple rounds Alice and Bob have identical keys with high probability; however, Eve has additional information about the key from the parity information exchanged. However, from a coding theory point of view information reconciliation is essentially source coding with side information, in consequence any coding scheme that works for [...] this problem can be used for information reconciliation. Lately turbocodes, LDPC codes [...] and polar codes [...] have been used for this purpose improving the efficiency of the cascade protocol.|$|E

I, on the contrary, have been led to the opinion that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>vital</b> <b>to</b> any practical or effective policy against sweating. It is no use to attempt, in trades as complex and obscure as these with which we are dealing, to substitute outside authority for trade opinion. The only hope lies in the judicious combination of the two, each acting and reacting upon the other. A mere increase of the penal provisions and inspection would be a poor compensation for the active support of a powerful section within the trade itself. It is upon the probationary period that we rely to enable us to rally to the Trade Board and to its minimum wage the best employers in the trade. In most instances the best employers in the trade are already paying wages equal or superior to the probable minimum which the Trade Board will establish. The inquiries which I have set on foot in the various trades scheduled have brought to me most satisfactory assurances from nearly all the employers to whom my investigators have addressed themselves.|$|E
