50|$|One {{difficulty}} {{which has}} delayed GEV {{development is the}} classification and legislation to be applied. The International Maritime Organisation has studied the application of rules based on the International Code of Safety for High-Speed Craft (<b>HSC</b> <b>code)</b> which was developed for fast ships such as hydrofoils, hovercraft, catamarans and the like. The Russian Rules for classification and construction of small type A ekranoplans is a document upon which most GEV design is based. However, in 2005, the IMO classified the WISE or GEV craft {{under the category of}} ships.|$|E
40|$|The growing global {{acceptance}} of alternative fuels and electrified vehicles, accelerated by stricter emission rules, has accentuated {{the demand for}} more engineers who are adept in advanced vehicle technologies, particularly {{in the field of}} hybrid electric vehicles. Through the EcoCAR 3 challenge, the University of Waterloo Alternative Fuels Team (UWAFT) has the opportunity to produce a split parallel plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) that runs on an alternative fuel that has 85 % ethanol and 15 % gasoline (E 85). With the avant-garde design of a snowmobile engine (850 cc turbocharged, two-cylinder) with pre and post transmission motors and an 8 -speed automatic transmission, {{there is a need to}} build an equally innovative hybrid supervisory controller (HSC). This research focuses on the process followed to build pragmatic controls for its HSC that aims to optimise vehicle performance while ensuring safe operation, lowering emissions, and maximising fuel economy. The question of how an HSC built in a student team environment, which transitions through various drive modes, can ensure safety coverage has not yet been sufficiently addressed. Along with documentation that has traceability between requirements and testing of the <b>HSC</b> <b>code,</b> UWAFT’s HSC is intelligently structured for manageability, serviceability and ultimately safety. This investigation starts with methodologies adopted to ascertain traceability between requirements developed and testing done for validation and verification of the developed <b>HSC</b> <b>code</b> for automotive safety. UWAFT’s HSC is a rule-based controller developed through model-based design. Following regression testing in various environments such as SIL and HIL, the integrated <b>HSC</b> <b>code</b> is then tested in vehicle. For the integrated code to be cohesive, the rules for code partitioning to maintain its readability and how the model is managed are discussed. The preliminary results of the <b>HSC</b> <b>code</b> prove its practicality by showing effective transitions and torque splitting. Thus, by providing an HSC with incorporated safety and intelligent structure for rapid code development, a new benchmark is set for HSC developed within student team environments...|$|E
50|$|The {{design and}} safety of {{high-speed}} craft is regulated by the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Convention, Chapter 10, High Speed Craft (<b>HSC)</b> <b>Codes</b> of 1994 and 2000, adopted by the Maritime Safety Committee of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO).|$|R
40|$|Abstract�The {{application}} of stability theory {{has led to}} detailed studies {{of different types of}} vessels; however, the shortage of information relating to multihull vessels demanded further investigation. This study shows that the position of the hulls has a very influential effect on both the transverse and longitudinal stability of the tricore. <b>HSC</b> stability <b>code</b> is applied for the optimisation of the hull configurations. Such optimization criteria would undoubtedly aid the performance of the vessel for both commercial or leisure purposes an b...|$|R
40|$|The District is {{currently}} {{designated as a}} nonattainment area for both state and federal ozone, PM 101 and PM 2. 52 standards. A strategy to control air pollution is to reduce emissions from new and modified stationary sources through a New Source Review (NSR) program. The federal Clean Air Act (CAA) and its associated regulations contain requirements for the District to adopt and implement a State Implementation Plan (SIP) -approved NSR program for minor stationary sources and major stationary sources and major modifications. Similarly, the California Clean Air Act sets requirement to offset the impact of new sources. Under the California Health and Safety <b>Code</b> (<b>HSC)</b> and California <b>Code</b> of Regulations, the District is required to establish a no net increase program for emissions of nonattainment pollutants from all new or modified stationary sources which emit, or {{have the potential to}} emit, 10 tons or more per year. Rule 202, NEW SOURCE REVIEW, was first adopted on September 20, 1976 and was last amended on October 28, 2010. Rule 202 applies to both minor and major sources. Until recently, the version of Rule 202 as amended on November 20, 1984, was the District’s SIP-approved NSR rule. The 1984 version contained requirements mandated by the CAA for both NSR and Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) programs...|$|R
40|$|The air-lifted {{catamaran}} (ALC) is {{an innovative}} fast marine transportation concept, comprising the application and variation of a new, skirtless air cushion and air lubrication, thus rendering it {{a hybrid of}} a catamaran and an SES (surface effect ship). Its features and capabilities are beyond those of current, conventional high-speed monohulls and catamarans. The present paper presents pertinent studies on stability concerning this craft, including dynamic stability, stability in turning, and directional stability. The stability analysis takes into account air compressibility in the cushion, and is {{carried out in the}} time domain. Some simulated results are presented and discussed, and requirements for design and operation of the craft, based on IMO <b>HSC</b> <b>Code</b> 2000, are briefly outlined...|$|E
40|$|Thank {{you for the}} {{opportunity}} to review the draft risk characterization (RCD) and exposure assessment (EAD) documents for carbofuran, both dated March 1, 2005, prepared by the Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR). The Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) reviews risk assessments prepared by DPR under the general authority of the Health and Safety <b>Code</b> (<b>HSC),</b> Section 59004, and also under the Food and Agricultural Code (FAC), Section 13129, in which OEHHA has the authority to provide advice, consultation, and recommendations to DPR concerning the risks to human health associated with exposure to pesticide active ingredients. In addition, pursuant to Food and Agricultural Code sections 14022 and 14023, OEHHA provides review, consultation and comments to DPR on the evaluation of the health effects of candidate toxic air contaminants (TAC) included in the TAC documents.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{effective}} scene text recognition method using sparse coding based features, called Histograms of Sparse <b>Codes</b> (<b>HSC)</b> features. For character detection, {{we use the}} HSC features instead of using the Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features. The HSC features are extracted by computing sparse codes with dictionaries that are learned from data using K-SVD, and aggregating per-pixel sparse codes to form local histograms. For word recognition, we integrate multiple cues including character detection scores and geometric contexts in an objective function. The final recognition results are obtained by searching for the words which correspond to the maximum value of the objective function. The parameters in the objective function are learned using the Minimum Classification Error (MCE) training method. Experiments on several challenging datasets demonstrate that the proposed HSC-based scene text recognition method outperforms HOG-based methods significantly and outperforms most state-of-the-art methods...|$|R
40|$|A {{research}} program is developing at the University of Naples “Federico II” whose main {{purpose is to}} individuate advanced methods {{for the design of}} high-speed vessels in aluminum alloy. The evolution of the structural design in the field of the high-speed transport has led to the application of new technologies of construction. Particularly the use of aluminium seems to be particularly suitable in the realization of fast ferry designed for small and medium coastal shipping. The structural design process for such ships must satisfy some requirements, which are the strength analysis to the local and global loads and the structural optimisation of weight. First of all a general layout configuration has been drawn starting from design data and requirements for the connections between Tyrrhenian towns and near islands, of Campania, Pontino, Tuscan and Sicilian archipelagos. The internal subdivision has been obtained basing on the <b>HSC</b> 2000 <b>code.</b> Successively basing on a study that has led to a first step hull form (taking into account hydrostatic and hydrodynamic requirements), the problem of the structural analysis for such ships has been studied. It has been started from the consideration that, for an optimisation of the structural design process, a finite element method in the quasi-static form must be applied to the entire structure, in order to evaluate the “real” stresses and strains all over the hull and to identify the most critical structural elements. Finally the results obtained have been particularly discussed...|$|R
40|$|Object {{detection}} {{has seen}} huge progress in recent years, much {{thanks to the}} heavily-engineered Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features. Can we go beyond gradients and do better than HOG? We provide an affirmative answer by proposing and investigating a sparse representation for object detection, Histograms of Sparse <b>Codes</b> (<b>HSC).</b> We compute sparse codes with dictionaries learned from data using K-SVD, and aggregate per-pixel sparse codes to form local histograms. We intentionally keep true to the sliding window framework (with mixtures and parts) and only change the underlying features. To keep training (and testing) efficient, we apply dimension reduction by computing SVD on learned models, and adopt supervised training where latent positions of roots and parts are given externally e. g. from a HOG-based detector. By learning and using local representations that are much more expressive than gradients, we demonstrate large improvements over {{the state of the}} art on the PASCAL benchmark for both rootonly and part-based models. 1...|$|R
40|$|Object {{recognition}} in natural surroundings {{is one of}} the most ambitious goals of digital image processing. In our work, strategies for the analysis of traffic scenes are investigated. The Hierarchical Structure <b>Code</b> (<b>HSC)</b> is applied to this problem and it has been shown that fast object recognition is possible. The HSC provides a unified approach for contour-based and region-based descriptions of structures. Hardware is being built to compute the HSC in video real time and a library of HSC-operations has been developed to extract invariant features like structure types, shape descriptions, or relations between structures. As part of the PROMETHEUS-project, we examined a set of 141 traffic scenes in order to develop strategies for an automatic analysis. Some of them are already implemented by using the set of domain independent HSC-operations together with some newly created ones. Hereby, we could show that fast analysis of traffic scenes is possible with the HSC by using parallel hardw [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The Health & Safety <b>Code</b> (<b>HSC)</b> in California {{contains}} {{provisions that}} can exempt a recyclable material from categorization as a hazardous waste if certain strict criteria are met. The Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) is wary of "sham " recycling and requires substantial proof of beneficial reuse for a facility {{to qualify for}} this exemption under HSC 25143. 2. A large military installation in California generated 7. 9 million pounds of oil/water separator (OWS) waste in 1998. Because the OWS waste contains oily components and was presumed to fail the aquatic toxicity test, the installation recategorized the OWS waste from nonhazardous to a California hazardous waste. This change in categorization resulted in a large increase in disposal costs and volumes for the facility. In 1999, the installation began contracting the onsite recycling of the waste using a mobile gravity separation unit {{in an effort to}} control disposal costs. In 1999, CH 2 M HILL evaluated the onsite recycling process as part of the Senate Bill (SB) - 14 report/plan and suggested that the recycled water had a beneficial reuse i...|$|R
40|$|A {{consensus}} is emerging that continuous (or metric) measures {{can be useful}} in phylogenetic systematics. Many of the methods for coding such characters, how- ever, employ elements that are arbitrary and therefore should be excluded from use in cladistic analysis. The continued use of such potentially inappropriate methods can be attributed to either their simplicity or the availability of computer programs specifically designed to produce data matrices using these methods. Conversely, one of the most suitable methods, homogeneous subset <b>coding</b> (<b>HSC),</b> is underused, probably {{due to the lack of}} a suitable software implementation for this somewhat complex procedure. This paper describes TaxMan, a Web-based facility for the coding of continuous data using HSC. Data are entered using a form accessible via any internet browser and are automatically converted to a matrix suitable for input into tree-searching software. This implementation of the HSC technique provides an uncomplicated procedure for the incorporation of metric data in phylogenetic systematics. The algorithmic implementation of the HSC procedure, and interpolation of the Studentised range and maximum modulus distributions required by it, is described in detail in appendices.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{theoretical and}} scoping experimental efforts {{to investigate the}} decontamination potential of a slag remelting process for decontaminating irradiated vanadium alloys. Theoretical calculations, using a commercial thermochemical computer <b>code</b> <b>HSC</b> Chemistry, determined the potential slag compositions and slag-vanadium alloy ratios. The experiment determined the removal characteristics of four surrogate transmutation isotopes (Ca, Y - to simulate Sc, Mn, and Ar) from a V- 5 Ti- 5 Cr alloy with calcium fluoride slag. An electroslag remelt furnace {{was used in the}} experiment to melt and react the constituents. The process achieved about a 90 percent removal of calcium and over 99 percent removal of yttrium. Analyses indicate that about 40 percent of the manganese may have been removed. Argon analyses indicates that 99. 3 % of the argon was released from the vanadium alloy in the first melt increasing to 99. 7 % during the second melt. Powder metallurgy techniques were used to incorporate surrogate transmutation products in the vanadium. A powder mixture was prepared with the following composition: 90 wt % vanadium, 4. 7 wt % titanium, 4. 7 wt % chromium, 0. 35 wt % manganese, 0. 35 wt % CaO, and 0. 35 wt % Y{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }. This mixture was packed into 2. 54 cm diameter stainless steel tubes. Argon was introduced into the powder mixture by evacuating and backfilling the stainless steel containers to a pressure of 20 kPa (0. 2 atm). The tubes were hot isostatically pressed at 207 MPa (2000 atm) and 1473 K to consolidate the metal. An electroslag remelt furnace (crucible dimensions: 5. 1 cm diameter by 15. 2 cm length) was used to process the vanadium electrodes. Chemical analyses were performed on samples extracted from the slags and ingots. Ingot analyses results are shown below. Values are shown in percent removal of the four targeted elements of the initial compositions...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} demand of {{higher and higher}} speeds of ferries has been developed in recent years leading to a target ship mission profile: transport of cars and passengers along routes of about 150 / 200 nautical miles. In this context the University of Genova, Napoli and Trieste, in a joint research project, started studying some trimaran concept ships, competitors of the existing monohull high speed passenger ferries. Many investigations {{have been carried out}} about hydrodynamic and sea keeping performances aiming to improve speed and comfort of passengers. However, some of the structural design problems are still pending. As a matter of facts, in last years Classification Societies succeeded in developing quite complete codes suggesting simplified but reliable formulations for the scantling of fast units structures; High Speed Craft <b>codes</b> (<b>HSC)</b> are at present widely used for new monohull and catamaran passenger vessels. Nevertheless trimaran ships are not included and the application of HSC rules to this kind of vessels appears unfair without considering substantial differences in terms of ship’s motions and structural resistance definition. Direct calculations should then be considered for this kind of vessels particularly for the definition of the resistance of the whole structure which should take into account longitudinal, transversal and horizontal bending moments together with longitudinal and transversal torque acting on the three hulls. The definition of these loads can be performed with accuracy by using three-dimensional seakeeping analysis based on panel methods. In a preliminary stage simplified methods based on quasi-static wave approach can be sufficient for the definition of complete, three-dimensional load sets and the scantling of the main structural elements of the main and side hulls. The structural resistance can be assessed by finite element models of the structure studied under the action of the previously calculated load sets. A refinement of the model can be carried out and studied in the worst load condition. The aim {{of this paper is to}} describe the application of the above procedure to a large trimaran fast ferry. In the research framework the complete structural design of the vessel has been obtained...|$|R
