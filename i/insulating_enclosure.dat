40|$|The high {{resolution}} spectrograph of the TNG (SARG) was projected {{to cover a}} spectral range from A=O. 37 up to 0. 9 pm, with resolution ranging from R=l 9, 000 up to R= 144, 000. The dispersing element of the spectrograph is an R 4 echelle grating in Quasi-Littrow mode; the beam size is 100 mm giving an RS product of RS= 46, 000 at order centre. Both single object and long slit (up to 30 arcsec) observing modes are possible: {{in the first case}} cross-dispersion is provided by means of a selection of four grisms; interference filters are used for the long slit mode. A dioptric camera images the cross dispersed spectra onto a mosaic of two 2048 x 4096 EEV CCDs (pixel size: 13. 5 pm) allowing complete spectral coverage at all resolving power for A. <O. 8. tm. Confocal image slicers are foreseen for observations at R 76, 000; an absorbing cell for accurate radial velocities is also considered. SARG will be rigidly fixed to one of the arms of the TNG fork by means of an optical table and a special thermally <b>insulating</b> <b>enclosure</b> (temperature of all spectrograph components will be kept constant at a preset value by a distributed active thermal control system).

40|$|Several noise {{sources such}} as {{machinery}} with rotating or reciprocating parts routinely produce high levels of noise in narrow frequency ranges lying in the neighbourhood of the rotating or reciprocating frequency and their harmonics. When enclosures are used to isolate such noise sources, peak response might be observed at these frequency ranges due both to increased excitation amplitude and resonating phenomena caused by {{the interaction of the}} excitation with the acoustic modes of the enclosure. Especially in the low frequency range and for low or intermediate wall absorption, the acoustic response of the enclosure is modal and these peak responses can be intense. This paper proposes a methodology to minimize the effect of narrow-frequency-band noise by redistribution of the acoustic modes of the <b>insulating</b> <b>enclosure.</b> This can be achieved by shifting the enclosure acoustic modes away from the excitation frequency so as to make superimposed resonating phenomena less intense. For that, several variable geometric modifications of the enclosure walls are introduced. The magnitude of those modifications that will lead to sparse mode distribution in the neighbourhood of the excitation frequency is estimated by means of a combined finite element-optimisation method. The above methodology is applied to an orthogonal enclosure and two different narrow-band loads in the neighbourhood of 90 and 120 Hz are studied. It is shown that, for each frequency load, a feasible set of geometric modifications can be found so as for the neighbouring modes to be shifted and, consecutively, for resonating effects to be made less intense. Furthermore it is shown that feasible {{solution to the problem of}} simultaneous control of noise having two or more intense excitation frequencies is also attainable...|$|E

In one embodiment, the refrigeration system includes a photovoltaic panel, a variable speed compressor, an <b>insulated</b> <b>enclosure,</b> and a thermal reservoir. The photovoltaic (PV) panel converts sunlight into DC (direct current) electrical power. The DC electrical power drives a compressor that circulates refrigerant through a vapor compression refrigeration loop to extract {{heat from the}} <b>insulated</b> <b>enclosure.</b> The thermal reservoir is situated inside the <b>insulated</b> <b>enclosure</b> and includes a phase change material.

A capacitor is provided to smooth the power voltage and to provide additional current during compressor start-up.

40|$|The Australian {{branch of}} the SEED project created a new {{formalism}} for design spaces in which the fundamental structuring operator is information specificity, formally characterised as subsumption. Here design space navigation is composed as combinations of the primitive operators of resolution, unification, anti-unification, search, query and hysterical undo. The structures needed to support such a view are highly constrained in a mathematical sense {{and it is in}} these constraints that the problems for representation of geometry arise. The research challenge is to add the formal design space exploration constraints into an existing geometric representation scheme or alternatively to discover a new scheme in which the constraints are realized. Based on Typed Feature Structures (TFS), Geometric Typed Feature Structures (GTFS) are a representation scheme and method for performing the basic design space exploration operations on geometric objects. The crucial insight behind extending TFS to geometry is to discover useful algebraic structures of geometric objects affording the mathematics required of TFS. In this paper we describe Geometric Typed Feature Structures through one example of form: IOPSet.

The validity of this procedure is examined here {{in the context of the}} history of 18 O 2 /N 2 reference tanks compared over a 12 -yr time-frame. By considering differences in tank sizes, material types, and by performing additional tests, the long-term stability of the delivered gas is evaluated with respect to surface reactions, leakage, regulator effects, and thermal diffusion and gravimetric fractionation. Results are also reported for the stability of CO 2 in these tanks.

A 7 -facet reflector system, with an effective concentration ratio of 4. 7, is used to focus irradiance along a string of series connected poly-crystalline photovoltaic cells. I-V characteristics of 4 -, 6 - and 8 -cell photovoltaic receivers are measured under 1 -sun and 4. 83 -sun conditions. Under concentration, the 8 -cell photovoltaic receiver produced 23 percent more power than the 4 -cell photovoltaic receiver, which suggests that the effect of series resistance can be minimized if smaller, lower current photovoltaic cells are used.

Simulations of different combinations of dry-bulb temperature, relative humidity, and airspeeds while independently controlling chamber surface temperature (ts) can be evaluated. AThERMS is a 1. 04 x 1. 17 x 1. 04 m chamber inside a large <b>Insulated</b> <b>Enclosure</b> (IE) where air supplied by an air handling unit provides unique TEs to both AThERMS and the IE.

Analysis of velocity contours sliced in different x, y, z planes surrounding the BGT at three nominal flowrates indicated steady patterns and helped guide placement of the airspeed sensor used to derive the impact of convection on measured BGT temperature.

The experiment may also be interpreted as an investigation of whether the one-way speeds of light in the east-west and west-east directions on the rotating earth are the same. The light pulses were sent from a laser coupled to a telescope at the NASA Goddard Optical Research Facility (GORF) in Greenbelt, Maryland to the U. S. Naval Observatory (USNO) in Washington, DC. The optical path was made possible by a 30 -cm flat mirror on a water tower near GORF and a 25 -cm flat mirror on top of the Washington National Cathedral near USNO. The path length was 26. 0 km with an east-west component of 20. 7 km. The pulses were reflected back over the same path by a portable array of corner cube reflectors. The transmission and return times were measured with a stationary Sigma Tau hydrogen maser and a University of Maryland event timer at GORF, while the times of reflection were measured with a similar maser and event timer combination carefully transported to USNO. Both timekeeping systems were housed in highly <b>insulated</b> <b>enclosures</b> and were maintained at constant temperatures to within +/- 0. 1 C by microprocessor controllers.

The average annual use of household electricity was 27. 7 kWh/m² in one bedroom apartments and 29. 1 kWh/m² in two bedroom apartments. The use varied between almost zero and 90 kWh/m 2 in the different apartments.
