Fifteen days of industrial action followed, at the conclusion of which the striking staff returned to work having failed to secure any concessions from the Board. Some conditions were curtailed, and the liberal approach to various employment matters that workers had enjoyed was replaced by a hard-liner stance.

By increasing the superannuation rate to that of the age benefit for a married person, this meant that national superannuation, hospital attention, family benefits, drugs and medicines were now free of an income test.|$|R

50|$|The Callaghan Government also {{introduced}} {{a range of}} measures aimed at moderating pressures for wage rises {{and to create a}} favourable climate “for an orderly restoration of collective bargaining.” These included the granting of family income supplements to bring the incomes of lower-paid workers up to the level of social security benefits, the lowering of marginal tax rates on smaller incomes by rises <b>in</b> personal <b>allowances,</b> and <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> children’s <b>allowances</b> (which were payable to the mother). However, child tax allowances were lowered, which had the effect of reducing the take home pay of fathers. The impact of consumer price rises was also mitigated by higher income limits for free school meals, an increased milk subsidy, and a substantial reduction in the duty on petrol. In addition, electricity prices were lowered for families in receipt of supplementary benefits.|$|R

40|$|A {{total of}} 228 {{crossbred}} pigs {{were used to}} investigate the effect of gender (gilts and barrows), density at housing (0. 84 and 0. 76 m 2 /pig) and the interaction on growth performance and carcass and merit from 19. 4 to 110 kg body weight. Feed intake of gilts increased as the space allowance decreased but no effect was observed in barrows (p< 0. 05 for the interaction). However, no interaction was observed for average daily gain or feed-to-gain ratio. Barrows had 2. 4 % less (p< 0. 01) carcass lean percentage but 9 % more (p< 0. 05) intramuscular fat content than gilts. The concentration of linoleic acid in the outer layer of backfat was higher (p< 0. 05) for gilts than for barrows when pigs were allocated at 0. 84 m 2 /pig, but no differences were observed at 0. 76 m 2 /pig. Also, barrows had 2. 7 % more (p< 0. 05) total saturated fatty acids (SFA) in the outer layer of backfat and lower monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) (p< 0. 01) and linoleic acid (p< 0. 05) content in the inner layer than gilts. Housing density did not affect any of the carcass quality traits studied but an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> space <b>allowance</b> decreased (p< 0. 05) MUFA content in both layers. Pigs allocated at 0. 84 m 2 /pig tended (p< 0. 10) to have higher SFA content in the inner layer than pigs allocated at 0. 76 m 2 /pig. We concluded that gilts and barrows respond differently to space allocation in respect to feed intake and unsaturation of backfat. Housing density did not affect growth performance of pigs slaughtered at 110 kg but MUFA content decreased with <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> space <b>allowance...</b>|$|R
