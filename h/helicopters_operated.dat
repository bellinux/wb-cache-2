5|$|On 27 May 2011, {{military}} officials announced that Apaches would be deployed {{as part of}} Operation Ellamy, the ongoing military intervention in Libya. The <b>helicopters</b> <b>operated</b> from the flight deck of HMS Ocean in conjunction with French Eurocopter Tiger helicopters over Misrata. The Apaches were also to assist in Operation Unified Protector, the enforcement of an embargo and no-fly zone upon Libya. On 14 June 2011, reports of British preparation to evacuate Yemen emerged, involving Apache and Merlin helicopters operating from Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessels off the coast.|$|E
5|$|On 7 January 1992, {{a pair of}} Italian Army Agusta-Bell AB-206L LongRanger <b>helicopters</b> <b>operated</b> by ECMM {{observers}} entered Croatian {{air space}} from Hungary. The helicopters were white-painted and unarmed. They were flying from the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade to Zagreb via Kaposvár, Hungary. Authorities in Belgrade claim the helicopters were authorised to fly to Hungary, but that the pilots were warned they {{were not allowed to}} fly to Zagreb because no flights in Croatian airspace were permitted. The EC dismissed those claims, saying that the flight was approved in advance by Yugoslav air controllers. The approval was forwarded to the Yugoslav Air Force operations centre, but the order was never forwarded to the 5th Aviation Corps in Bihać, Bosnia and Herzegovina.|$|E
5|$|USS Guam and USS Trenton began transit {{from the}} coast of Oman towards Mogadishu at 22:30 (23:30 Oman time) on 2 January. The {{commander}} of Amphibious Group Two had initially proposed a seven-ship Amphibious Task Group, composed of vessels anchored at Masirah Island (off Oman) and Dubai and including four amphibious ships so that {{the full range of}} amphibious capabilities would be available for the operation. However, intervention in Kuwait seemed imminent and the commander of naval forces at Central Command did not want to divert that many ships from the Persian Gulf, thus the decision to send two of the closest ships. Although the two vessels were selected by mid-afternoon on 2 January, the transfer of some personnel from Dubai to Masirah caused a delay of eight to ten hours. Guam and Trenton carried forces from the 4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade, including a detachment of CH-53E Super Stallion helicopters—the largest <b>helicopters</b> <b>operated</b> by the US military—and two squadrons of CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters.|$|E

Together with Nanuq, Aiviq was able to hold the drilling rig stationary during the crew evacuation and later continue towing the vessel away from the coast.|$|E

500|$|In 2003 a {{detachment}} of three CH-47Ds was deployed to the Middle East {{as part of}} the Australian contribution to the invasion of Iraq. The detachment formed part of the Special Operations Task Group, and operated from Jordan to transport supplies and personnel to Australian special forces units. Two histories published in 2004 stated that the <b>helicopters</b> <b>operated</b> in Western Iraq throughout the initial stage of the conflict. A 2005 history also started that one of the tasks undertaken by the detachment was flying commandos from the 4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment to Al Asad Airbase within Iraq after the facility was captured by Special Air Service Regiment units. An uncompleted internal Army history of the deployment of Australian forces to the Iraq War—released in 2017 following a freedom of information request—stated that as the Chinooks were not equipped with missile countermeasure systems and their pilots had not been trained to insert special forces behind enemy lines, they had been prohibited from operating closer than [...] from the border between Jordan and Iraq. This history judged that [...] "it is not possible to explain the rationale" [...] for the deployment of the CH-47s given their unsuitability for operations within Iraq, and stated that the main achievement of the detachment was to free up British and American helicopters for other tasks.|$|E

2500|$|The {{shift from}} full, carrier-embarked squadrons to single- or two-helicopter flights {{operating}} from frigates forced overhauls {{of the management}} and organisational style of the FAA, with squadrons made to act with increasing independence and less experienced junior officers taking greater responsibility for the aviation activities of their assigned ship. During the 1980s, the Eurocopter Ecureuil (Squirrel) and Sikorsky S-70 Seahawk were acquired to operate from the Adelaide-class frigates. During the early 1990s, these <b>helicopters</b> <b>operated</b> aboard Australian ships deployed to support the international coalition during the Gulf War; they were used for anti-air surveillance and surface search, to deliver boarding parties to interdicted ships, and provide search-and-rescue capabilities. During 1992, FAA Sea Kings were embarked aboard [...] for Operation Solace, part of the famine-relief operation in Somalia.|$|E
