5|$|In 1951, the California Supreme Court affirmed in Stoumen v. Reilly {{the right}} of homosexuals to {{assemble}} peacefully. To assist homosexuals with legal problems, in 1951 labor activist Harry Hay started the Mattachine Society, from his living room in Los Angeles. A few years later, Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin started the Daughters of Bilitis with six other women in San Francisco, initially to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> socialize without fear of harassment or arrest. Within a few years, both organizations learned {{of each other and}} grew to have similar goals: helping assimilate homosexuals into general society, working for legal reform to repeal sodomy laws, and assisting those who were arrested. Both groups were headquartered in San Francisco by 1957.|$|E

25|$|Orville was {{actively}} involved in his community, making a point to give back and help those less fortunate. One of the big problems then and now was poverty. As a result, Jefferson County established a poor house system paid for by appropriations from each town. In 1826, Hungerford was appointed {{as one of the}} first superintendents of the poor house located on the 150-acre Dudley Farm in Le Ray, New York. People sent to the poor house would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> live and would be provided with food and rudimentary medical care in exchange for some work, usually tied in with farming, e.g., picking oakum.|$|E
25|$|In the {{continuation}} of the reading, Moses instructed that when the Israelites had settled in the land, they were to divide the land into three parts and set aside three Cities of Refuge, so that any manslayer could <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> which to flee. And if the Israelites faithfully observed all the law and God enlarged the territory, then they were to add three more towns to those three. Only a manslayer who had killed another unwittingly, without being the other's enemy, might flee there and live. For instance, if a man went with his neighbor into a grove to cut wood, and as he swung an axe, the axe-head flew off the handle and struck and killed the neighbor, then the man could flee to one of the cities of refuge and live. The second open portion ends here.|$|E

[...] In 2012 the auditorium was named Paul O’Regan Hall following a $1 million donation by the O’Regan family in honour of the late businessman and philanthropist.

The fountain is triangular and cast from Oregon sandstone. The Italianesque trefoil supports two drinking platforms with three basins each, with one platform intended for use by dogs.

Thayne Logan, a designer who worked for Linde, said that Shemanski [...] "wanted something for the little animals".

The gay couple introduced Martin and Lyon to another lesbian couple, one of whom suggested they create a social club. In October 1955, eight women — four couples — met to provide each other with a social outlet. One of their priorities was to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> dance, as dancing with the same sex in a public place was illegal. Martin and Lyon recalled later, [...] "Women needed privacy...not only from the watchful eye of the police, but from gaping tourists in the bars and from inquisitive parents and families." [...] Although unsure of how exactly to proceed with the group, they began to meet regularly, realized they should be organized, and quickly elected Martin as president. From the start they had a clear focus to educate other women about lesbians, and reduce their self-loathing brought on by the socially repressive times.|$|E
