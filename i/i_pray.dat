Rodney Jerkins is incredible, Jay of course is on it, he blessed the song, I'm happy with it.|$|E
500|$|On June 25, 2009, American {{entertainer}} Michael Jackson {{died while}} Beyoncé was touring. His death {{led her to}} perform tributes to Jackson at tour venues, including Atlanta, Georgia on July 1, 2009; and New Orleans, Louisiana on July 3, 2009. During the tribute, an image of Jackson was shown on the main screen. As Beyoncé sang an emotional rendition of [...] "Halo", she changed the lyrics to [...] "Michael I can see your Halo / <b>I</b> <b>pray</b> your music won't fade away". On January 12, 2010, Haiti was struck by an earthquake. A charity telethon called [...] took place on January 22, 2010, in which many artists, including Beyoncé, participated. She performed an acoustic version of [...] "Halo" [...] with Coldplay's lead vocalist Chris Martin playing the piano. To make the song match the night's purpose, Beyoncé weaved [...] "Haiti" [...] into its lyrics, singing [...] "Haiti, we can see your halo / You know you're my saving grace / You're everything I need and more, it's written all over your face / Haiti, we can see your halo / <b>I</b> <b>pray</b> you won't fade away".

500|$|James {{became obsessed}} with {{the threat posed by}} witches and wrote Daemonologie in 1597, a tract {{inspired}} by his personal involvement that opposed the practice of witchcraft and that provided background material for Shakespeare's Tragedy of Macbeth. James personally supervised the torture of women accused of being witches. After 1599, his views became more sceptical. In a later letter written in England to his son Henry, James congratulates the prince on [...] "the discovery of yon little counterfeit wench. <b>I</b> <b>pray</b> God ye may be my heir in such discoveries... most miracles now-a-days prove but illusions, and ye may see by this how wary judges should be in trusting accusations".|$|E
500|$|James {{was widely}} mourned. For all his flaws, he had largely {{retained}} the affection of his people, who had enjoyed uninterrupted peace and comparatively low taxation during the Jacobean era. [...] "As {{he lived in}} peace," [...] remarked the Earl of Kellie, [...] "so did he die in peace, and <b>I</b> <b>pray</b> God our king [...] may follow him". The earl prayed in vain: once in power, Charles and Buckingham sanctioned a series of reckless military expeditions that ended in humiliating failure. James had often neglected the business of government for leisure pastimes, such as the hunt; and his later dependence on favourites at a scandal-ridden court undermined the respected image of monarchy so carefully constructed by Elizabeth.|$|E
500|$|Muransky is also {{remembered for}} a cameo {{appearance}} in the 1983 film The Big Chill: [...] "I was in the theater watching it, not knowing {{what was going to}} happen. It was kind of interesting with all of (the characters) watching (the 1980 Michigan-Michigan State game). It was pretty cool. Watching [...] John Wangler go back was pretty cool. For a split-second as they're going back, I'm thinking to myself, 'Oh my God, <b>I</b> <b>pray</b> to God I'm not holding or I missed a block for a sack or something on the big screen pass.' But it was a good block, and it was a fun moment. Any time I hear 'The Big Chill,' it's good memories." ...|$|E

Schumacher also mentioned Tommy Lee Jones as a source of trouble: [...] "Jim Carrey was a gentleman, and Tommy Lee was threatened by him. I'm tired of defending overpaid, overprivileged actors. <b>I</b> <b>pray</b> I don't work with them again." [...] Carrey later acknowledged Jones was not friendly to him, telling him once off-set during the production, [...] "I hate you. I really don't like you ...

[...] "Love Without Tragedy", blends 80s pop music and guitar with a [...] "modern and fresh" [...] reggae {{inspired}} melody. Rihanna is channeling the emotions caused by her assault from Chris Brown in which can be seen through the lines [...] "Felt love struck me with a knife/ <b>I</b> <b>pray</b> that love don't strike twice", and [...] "Who knew the course of this one drive injured us fatally?" ...|$|E
500|$|Despite a {{perceived}} decline in his work's quality, the 1840s {{were the most}} financially successful of Etty's career. His income increased with further opportunities for patronage from a growing industrial class, and with few costs and all his earlier debts cleared, Etty {{was in a position}} to invest money for the first time. By 1841 Etty had around £300 invested, rising to £8500 in 1845 and £17,000 in 1849. He continued to have difficulty forming relationships with any woman other than Betsy Etty, writing in his diary in 1843 that [...] "being in sound Mind and Body I declare it to be my Firm Intention NEVER TO MARRY.

500|$|Discussing the {{progression}} from MercyMe's first album Almost There to {{the songs on}} Spoken For, [...] MercyMe's lead singer Bart Millard said in an interview: [...] "Our goal early on {{was to make sure}} our songs were 'singable' and make sure they fit on power point because we wanted to write songs for corporate worship. Spoken For is filled with songs that <b>I</b> <b>pray</b> the church will use." [...] He added that this album leaned more toward rock than Almost There. Millard said [...] of the origin of the album title: [...] "Over the last year I’ve been consumed with the idea that God is so crazy in love with us—just knowing that we are part of something bigger and we worship a God who’s in complete control no matter how good or bad things get. The phrase [...] "spoken for" [...] really stuck with me." ...|$|E
500|$|... 'Fly Like A Bird', is a kitchen-sink, hyper-produced gospel number, but {{is really}} quite moving. There is a real, human yearning for mercy in it — Mariah’s true cry for help from a place of near-suicidal despair: 'Sometimes this life can be so cold /(Lord) <b>I</b> <b>pray</b> you'll come and [...] carry me home'. But there’s {{a lot of hope}} and faith in this wounded voice: Carey keeps, with {{touching}} conviction, a firm grip on the idea that some higher, divine intelligence out there loves her, even if nobody else does; even if she is lost to herself. It comes across emotionally, because her heart is fully in it — Mimi has been beaten, humiliated, heartbroken; joys have been slapped out of her hands quicker than she could appreciate them. She’s deeply confused, and God, she really needs help. Hell: We’ve all been there.|$|E
