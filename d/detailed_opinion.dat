Expressing mild approval, he {{summarized}} his personal acceptance of the movement: [...] "If someone likes them, I'm not going to dissuade them, however, if someone doesn't like them, I'm not going to attempt convincing them otherwise". Furthermore, while noting new primitives are deserving of media attention, he wondered whether they're getting too much publicity because [...] "they are terrific as an added flavourful spice to a developed and varied rock scene, but can hardly function as the dominant trend". Focusing on EJK&HM, he labelled them [...] "Bosnia's answer to Sha Na Na", before proclaiming them an acceptable form of entertainment for the general masses and a welcome break from incoherent art rock pretentiousness. Though adding it's hard to believe this constitutes strong enough basis for a classic rock career, citing their unwillingness to freshen up their repetitive jokes and yucks as a concern for their long term career prospects. Glavan was more upbeat about Pušenje, finding them to be [...] "more musical, more talented, and {{in the context of}} an LP, simply stronger than EJK&HM". Comparing Pušenje to The Clash in addition to extolling their artistic ambition that [...] "saves them from becoming one-dimensional caricatures and additionally invokes locally flavoured stylized neorealism of Emir Kusturica's Sjećaš li se Doli Bel?", Glavan felt that, despite occasionally failing to properly articulate their inventiveness, the band has a fresh voice and a couple of great tracks off their debut album.|$|E

40|$|People {{express their}} {{opinions}} {{in various ways}} in different domains. With the growing interest in what other people think, mining opinions in texts {{has been the focus}} of attention for researchers in many different fields. Also, with the rapid development of technology and the internet, more and more multilingual and multicultural information has become available on the web. The objective of the present dissertation is exploring and automatically extracting opinions from multilingual corpora. In pursuing this objective, a bilingual opinion-annotated corpus was constructed focusing on <b>detailed</b> <b>opinion</b> factors with editorial texts. Annotated opinion factors include the holder of an opinion (Holder) and the topic of an opinion with its polarity (Positive Topic, Negative Topic). Factors used to express opinions as well as opinions across languages were investigated with the annotated corpus. The main contribution of this dissertation is the proposal of a multilingual sentiment analysis system for identifying opinion factors using a novel method that explores the linguistic structures used to express opinions. Without using pre-labeled opinion words, this multilingual sentiment analysis system directly identifies opinion factors using syntactic analysis, predicate-argument structure and pragmatic analysis. In the place of pre-labeled opinion words for each language, a clustered lexicon was constructed from bilingual dictionaries. Lexical features crucial for identifying the polarity were learned automatically. In addition to the lexical features, syntactic, morphological and contextual features were used in the learning algorithm. The syntactic structure of the sentence as well as predicate-argument structures extracted from the Propbank database were investigated and used to assign appropriate features to the target chunk. The experimental results show that the proposed system is significantly more successful than a baseline system. Experiments focusing on each novel method verify that both the clustered lexical dictionary and incorporating more linguistic structures benefit the accuracy of opinion factor extraction. The proposed system was also tested with an existing English monolingual corpus (MPQA corpus) composed of news articles, and yielded consistent results with the annotated corpus. With the experimental set-up of multilingual analysis, the way that opinions are expressed across languages was investigated and utilized to improve the results of the analysis. Experiments with cross-lingual features extracted from parallel sentences show even more improved results, which suggests cross-lingual reinforcement in identifying opinion factors with the proposed system...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: In {{fertility}} care, high-quality care is {{most often}} {{described in terms of}} effectiveness. The Institute of Medicine drew the attention to the importance of patient-centredness to quality of care. However {{in order to be able}} to evaluate the patient-centredness of fertility care, the concept ‘patient-centred fertility care’ needs to be clearly defined first of all. Patient-centred care takes into account what in care is important to patients. Because an in-depth insight into the patients’ perspective on fertility care is not provided by the literature, this called for an explorative qualitative study. The aim of this study was to define a framework for ‘patient-centred fertility care’ including rich descriptions of the patients’ perspective. Material and Methods: A total of 103 patients across 20 fertility clinics in The Netherlands and Belgium were included in 14 focus group discussions. The sample included men and women who experienced at least one of the following fertility treatments: IVF, ICSI, timed coitus or intra-uterine inseminations (with or without ovulation induction). Participants were asked to discuss their positive and negative experiences with fertility care in order to discover what ‘patient-centred fertility care’ is. Focus groups were recorded and transcribed verbatim. A basic conceptual model of the dimensions of ‘patient-centred fertility care’ was developed, based on the general model of patient-centredness (Picker Institute) and on a literature review focused on the patients’ perspective on fertility care. This model was the starting point for data analysis. Phenomenology was used to deepen our understanding of the experience of fertility patients and to create rich descriptions of their perspective. The phenomenological coding process was conducted by and discussed among two researchers independently to increase the reliability of the coding. The insights were used to adapt the model of ‘patient-centred fertility care’. Furthermore, patients were asked to draw a list with the 5 aspects of care, most important to them. Aspects were allocated to a dimension of ‘patient-centred fertility care’ through qualitative analysis. The first aspect on patients’ list resulted in 5 points for the relevant dimension; the second 4, and so on. The scores per dimension were added up and this resulted in a ranking of the dimensions of ‘patient-centred fertility care’. Results: The conceptual model of ‘patient-centred fertility care’ requires adaptation based on our qualitative research into the patients’ perspective on care. ‘Patient-centred fertility care’ is a multidimensional concept, with 10 main care dimensions: ‘accessibility’, ‘coordination and integration’, ‘physical comfort and facilities’, ‘continuity and transition’, ‘competence’, ‘emotional support’, ‘information and education’, ‘communication’, ‘patient involvement and privacy’ and ‘attitude of clinic staff’. For each dimension, patients have a <b>detailed</b> <b>opinion</b> on what they want. Based on patients’ priority listings, patients put most importance to (in order of importance) : ‘information and education’, ‘attitude of clinic staff’ and ‘competence’. Patients want timely, detailed, consistent and practical information and have concrete information needs. Patients want to be cared for by clinical staff with a friendly, empathic, understanding and devoted attitude who are trustworthy, competent, conscientious, thorough and punctual and they want monitoring of the clinic's quality. Conclusion: High-quality fertility care is also patient-centred. This study provides health care professionals with a model for the, until now rather vague, concept of ‘patient-centred fertility care’. This detailed model includes a rich description of the patients’ perspective. Further research is needed to develop a quantitative instrument to evaluate the patient-centredness of care according to this concept in European fertility clinics. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Background This {{report is}} based on {{research}} by Taylor Nelson Sofres (TNS), commissioned by the Soil Association {{and supported by the}} Welsh Development Agency and Organic Centre Wales to explore the attitudes and buying behaviour of organic consumers. The aim of the research, conducted in January and February 2003, was to increase understanding of consumer motivations in order to promote organic food more effectively and increase sales. The aim of this report is to summarise the research for the benefit of Welsh organic businesses and provide them with practical pointers for their marketing. Methodology TNS analysed the buying behaviour and attitudes of 15, 000 households using its Superpanel database and conducted a further, more <b>detailed</b> <b>opinion</b> survey in which they interviewed 4, 000 people in their homes. Key findings The market relies heavily on the purchases of a committed minority of ‘heavy buyers’ and sales through three leading retailers. Tesco, Waitrose and Sainsbury’s account for 70 per cent of organic food sales, and just 23 per cent of organic consumers account for 84 per cent of spending. Most lighter organic buyers are probably buying organic products ‘accidentally’ rather than consciously buying organic. The most important consumers for growing the market are the medium and heavy buyers whose motivations indicate a positive attitude towards organic food Heavy buyers tend to be older and better off than the UK population average, and most live in London and the South East. This is a discerning and selfconfident group of consumers, much more likely to regard themselves as connoisseurs of food and wine, to seek out eco-friendly products and to read the ingredients on packs before buying. The two most important motivations driving organic consumers are taste and health. There is a direct correlation between the extent to which consumers believe in the health and taste benefits of organic food and the number of categories they buy into. Taste and food safety concerns are the main factors in persuading people to try organic food {{for the first time and}} in encouraging buyers to increase their spending. But light consumers only become medium consumers – serious organic shoppers – when they also are persuaded of the positive health, environmental and animal welfare benefits of eating organic. A combination of delivering good-quality and great-tasting organic lines to medium consumers while communicating to them the food quality benefits in detail (ie pesticide and additive avoidance and higher nutrient content) may well be the key to expanding the body of heavy consumers. Among non-buyers, price is the main barrier to purchase, although one in seven non-buyers cites not having enough information to justify the price premium. Fruit and vegetables are the main entry point to organic purchasing. From there consumers tend to graduate to eggs and dairy products, then packaged grocery products, then meat and soft drinks. Most people first find out about organic food from a television programme or press article. Sixty per cent of organic consumers are more likely to buy organic food if it originates from the UK, compared to 1 per cent who are less likely to buy UK products and 38 per cent for whom it does not really matter. Motivation towards locally sourced products within the UK is generally not as strong as motivation towards UK products – with the exception of Wales, Scotland and the East Midlands, where support for local food is even stronger than support for UK produce generally. Key recommendations for marketing Tell the organic story: communicate product origin and all the diverse benefits of eating organic through promotional literature and on-pack information, encouragement of farm visits, building of contact with journalists Market and deliver on taste: ensure products meet consumer quality expectations, promote the full flavour of organic produce, organise promotional tastings Hit the consumer hotspots: focus marketing spend on medium and heavy consumers, the south east and the top three multiple retailers Keep it simple: don’t neglect to tell consumers how they identify organic products and how ‘organic’ differs from ‘free range’ and ‘natural’ Highlight health: communicate the highly motivational health benefits as far as advertising restrictions allow Make connections: link up with appropriate charities to accentuate wildlife and other benefits; exploit the typical sequence of buying by promoting eggs and dairy to fruit and veg consumers, meat to dairy consumers Exploit the Welshness of your product within Wales but highlight the Britishness elsewhere in the U...|$|E
40|$|Šis magistro baigiamasis darbas susideda iš trijų dalių. Pirmoje darbo dalyje analizuojama autonominių ginklų sistemų vystymosi eiga bei jų veikimo principai. Šiuo metu vyriausybės bei privačios įmonės sparčiai vysto autonominius ginklus. Tokie ginklais sugebėtų taikinio aptikimo, pasirinkimo bei puolimo stadijose veikti nepriklausomi bei nevaldomi žmogaus-operatoriaus. Taip pat tokie ginklai galėtų mąstyti ne deterministiniu, o stochastiniu būdu, bei galėtų naudoti dirbtinį intelektą, prisitaikyti prie aplinkos ir mokytis. Antroje darbo dalyje nagrinėjamas proporcingumo principas karo (tarptautinėje humanitarinėje) teisėje, jo elementai ir taikymo praktika, autonominių ginklų naudojimo grėsmes ir galimybes šio principo atžvilgiu bei dabartinio autonominių ginklų teisinio reglamentavimas. Tarptautinė humanitarinė teisė nustato proporcingumo principą, kuris įtvirtina taisyklę prieš kiekvieną puolimą įvertinti to puolimo proporcingumą, t. y. ar atsitiktinė žala, sukelta panaudotos ginkluotos jėgos, neturi akivaizdžiai viršyti tą jėgą naudojant tikėtino pasiekti tiesioginio karinio pranašumo. Kai kurie mokslininkai, teisininkai bei vyriausybinės ir nevyriausybinės institucijos teigia, kad autonominiai ginklai šio principo laikytis nesugebėtų, kadangi puolimo proporcingumo įvertinimas yra itin sudėtingas procesas, kuriam reikia turėti žmogiškąsias savybes. Autonominiai ginklai sugebėtų veikti geriau, tiksliau, efektyviau bei patikimiau negu žmonės. Tačiau yra neatmetama, kad autonominių ginklų programos gali gesti, o jų veikimas gali būti nesuderinamas su tarptautinės humanitarinės teisės principais. Todėl yra svarbu įvertinti bei ištirti, ar autonominiai ginklai galėtų laikytis proporcingumo principo. Trečioje darbo dalyje buvo sudaroma tyrimo metodologija, atliekamas tyrimas bei pateikiamos rekomendacijos, tarptautinės humanitarinės teisės reguliuotojams. Tyrimo būdais buvo pasirinkta kokybinė apklausa bei bylos analizė. Tyrimo metu nustatyta, kad autonominiai ginklai nesugebėtų laikytis proporcingumo principo, kadangi jie neturi žmogiškųjų savybių, reikalingų įvertinti puolimo proporcingumą. Karo teisės reguliuotojams pateikiama rekomendacija nustatyti, kad autonominiai ginklai, negali veikti visiškai savarankiškai karinės galios panaudojimo etape, todėl turi būti prižiūrimi žmogaus. Atlikus visus darbe keliamus uždavinius, darytina išvada, jog autonominiai ginklai nesugebėtų tinkamai pritaikyti proporcingumo principo, todėl ginamasis teiginys: autonominių ginklų panaudojimas pažeidžia proporcingumo principą, pasitvirtino. This master’s thesis {{consists}} of three parts. The first part analyzes the autonomous weapons systems development process and their operating principles. Some early types of weapons, like automatic weapons, which could operate without direct human intervention are being used for a long time. They are mostly to defend certain military objects like ships and bases. Those kind of weapons aren’t {{able to make a}} decision on their own, but rather follow a strict pre-programmed software, which tracks the criterions of possible targets, and when all the required criterions are met, the weapon engages in the attack. At the present, governmental and private companies are rapidly developing autonomous weapons. Such weapons would be capable of detecting, selecting and engaging targets independently and uncontrolled by a human operator. Also, autonomous weapons would be able to reason not only in a deterministic manner but also in stochastic. This would give the autonomous weapons an ability to make a decision, which was not pre-programmed in the software, which is controlling their behavior. Autonomous weapons would also be able to use artificial intelligence, adapt to the environment and learn on their own, which raises serious issues not limited to autonomous weapons compatibility with the current international humanitarian law, but also in the moral and ethical field. The second part analyzes the principle of proportionality in the international humanitarian (law of war) law, the elements and the practice of this principle, the possible advantages and threats in using autonomous weapons, and the current legal regulation of autonomous weapons. International humanitarian law imposes the principle of proportionality, which establishes a rule that “Launching an attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated, is prohibited. ” Some scientists, lawyers and governmental and non-governmental organizations claim that the autonomous weapons {{would not be able to}} follow this principle because measuring the proportionality of the attack is an extremely complicated process, which requires having human qualities. Nevertheless, the usage of autonomous weapons could give some advantages in the military. Because autonomous weapons do not possess some human qualities like tiredness, hunger, exhaustion, anger, they would be able to perform better, more precise, more efficient and more reliable than people. However, the usage of autonomous weapons poses some threats also. It is not excluded that the autonomous weapons would be using advanced computers, which may experience errors, crashes, viruses, and their performance may not be compatible with the principles of international humanitarian law. Therefore, it is important to evaluate and investigate whether autonomous weapons to comply with the principle of proportionality. Currently, there is no national or international treaty or law, which would ban the development and usage of autonomous weapons in its entirety, however, USA and UK have made official policies, which state, that the usage of autonomous weapons should always be monitored by humans. Some non-governmental organizations, scientists and lawyers, advocate, that the development and usage of such weapons should be banned. The third part covers the research methodology and the investigations and makes recommendations for the international humanitarian law regulators. The chosen methods of the research are a qualitative survey and case analysis. The qualitative survey research found that the autonomous weapons would not be able to comply with the principle of proportionality, because they lack human qualities, like consciousness, will and other reasoning capabilities, needed to evaluate the proportionality of the attack. Also, assessing the proportionality of the attack is one of the most difficult decisions in the battlefield, because the expected military advantage of the attack is constantly changing, it is also contextual and subjective to the commander. The experts also noticed that it is immoral and unethical to give the robots the ability to decide upon the life of a human. Therefore autonomous weapons should only be used under the watch of a human. One of the experts also notified, that the usage of autonomous weapons requires thorough testing and studying. Because of that, the expert couldn’t give the <b>detailed</b> <b>opinion</b> on autonomous weapons. The case analysis concluded, that determining the proportionality of attack is subjective and contextual. Therefore international humanitarian law has no clear standard of proportional attack. Consequently, the author is making a conclusion, that autonomous weapons would not be able to properly assess the proportionality of the military attack. The author is making a recommendation to the regulators of the international humanitarian law, that the autonomous weapons should only be developed and used in the way, that allows the human operator to directly intervene in the process of selecting and engaging the targets. After completing all the tasks of the master’s thesis, it can be concluded that the autonomous weapons would fail to properly assess the principle of proportionality, therefore the claim that the usage of autonomous weapons would violate the principle of proportionality was confirmed...|$|E

40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of last November&# 8217;s federal election Simon Crean voyaged to the wilds of south-western Sydney in search of answers for Labor&# 8217;s defeat, and {{the eyes of the}} media followed. For a few days the casual television viewer was treated to cameos of the shopping centres of Sydney&# 8217;s outer suburbs, its yawning expanses of suburban and semi-rural sprawl, its multi-car garages, walled estates and multi-storey red-brick castles. Somewhere around here, Crean and the media hoped together, could be found the elusive secrets of the &# 8216;aspirationals&# 8217;, that newly-discovered demographic whose flights of electoral fickleness have been causing political parties of all complexions such heartache. Traditionally, the electoral battlefield of Sydney has been characterised by a form of regional trench warfare, with the harbour as no-man&# 8217;s-land. Booth after booth north of Sydney Harbour has voted solidly for the Coalition for generations, while the inner- and mid-West have been and remain wastelands for the Liberals. Yet over the last decade these deeply engraved trench-lines have been suddenly out-flanked. Westwards, &# 8216;to the green fields beyond&# 8217;, Sydney&# 8217;s fast-growing outer-suburban fringe has revealed itself to be a highly volatile electoral terrain, superficially Labor in appearance but increasingly Liberal in voting behaviour. And so the national media packed its sandwiches for its brief excursion to Sydney&# 8217;s south-west. In truth, the journey was somewhat overdue. In Sydney few journalists or social commentators venture beyond the Tropic of Polished Floorboards, and sage judgements about something called generically &# 8216;the West&# 8217; are woven out of a colourful yarn of guesswork and hearsay. One strand of hoary journalistic folklore imagines Sydney&# 8217;s outer west as an undifferentiated badlands of deprivation, unemployment and boredom. Another decries it as a pilot-program for the imagined horrors of an &# 8216;Americanised&# 8217; suburban megalopolis. Recent newspaper and radio debates have agonised over the supposed dangers of what are referred to as the region&# 8217;s &# 8216;American-style gated communities&# 8217; or even &# 8216;walled camps&# 8217; - somewhat lurid descriptions for what in many cases are simply tidy housing developments pragmatically bundled together to save on amenities. In other commentaries the entirety of south-western Sydney is imaginatively reshaped in the image of its few most dysfunctional housing estates. Even the experienced Peter Botsman, head of the newly established Whitlam Institute at the University of Western Sydney&# 8217;s Parramatta campus (some thirty kilometres to the north-east), has recently been indulging in some rather Dickensian word-pictures, portraying south-western Sydney generally as a gaggle of &# 8216;lost suburbs&# 8217; perched {{at the end of a}} &# 8216;freeway of despair&# 8217;, where fragmented communities eke out a subsistence on benefits doled out from fenced &# 8216;welfare compounds&# 8217;. These are the kinds of lurid images local activists in the outer west have laboured for decades to overcome. The image of a region focused on quotidian pragmatism and the brute necessities of life is equally hard to shake. When the Urban Frontiers Program, also at the University of Western Sydney, released a detailed report on community attitudes across the broader Western Sydney region in October last year, the responses to their findings were almost as worthy of remark as the findings themselves. Asked for their positive and negative feelings, their personal concerns and the main problems of the region, almost eight hundred respondents consistently reported as positive features the region&# 8217;s community spirit, affordable housing and living space, while criticising its traffic and travel problems and the prevalence of crime and drugs. Asked to cite improvements in their suburb since they had moved in, they most often nominated improved shopping facilities, followed at some distance by public transport and roads. Given the sprawling, open-knit character of much of the region, and the most common reasons people choose to move there, none of this was too surprising. And it was accompanied by a solid vote of approval by respondents for the particular local communities of which they felt a part. Yet it led to a public bout of anguish and embarrassment as to why residents across these various localities had not said more about the presence or absence of theatres, restaurants and sundry other cultural facilities. The image of the outer West as a monolith is similarly tenacious, and not much less misguided. When asked by the Urban Frontiers researchers what community they most closely associated with, more than two-thirds of residents nominated their suburb of residence, while the remainder was more or equally split between &# 8216;Western Sydney&# 8217;, &# 8216;Sydney&# 8217; and &# 8216;no opinion&# 8217;. Sydney&# 8217;s outer south-west, in particular, has developed into a highly-variegated patchwork of distinct local communities, some rural or semi-rural, some suburban, others high-rise, and others again based around those clusters of off-the-rack &# 8216;plan homes&# 8217; aimed at space-hungry young home-buyers fired with a dream of growing families and rolling billiard-rooms. Come election-time the electorate of Macarthur - which covers the long flat plain southwards from Badgerys Creek to Campbelltown - resembles nothing so much as a motley collection of medieval villages, each writing their entry in the Domesday Book. The image of the outer south-west as a lost &# 8216;Labor heartland&# 8217; is now fading. In fact, the region has become one of the more electorally volatile areas in the country. In 1996 the seat of Macarthur swung sharply to the Liberals, by a matter of 12 per cent in two-party terms; Labor&# 8217;s primary vote fell to 32 per cent. In 1998 Labor clawed back a couple of percent, but in 2001 it suffered another big swing, and is down to 43 per cent of the two-party vote. Key factors here are the relatively recent arrival of so many residents into growth areas like Camden and Campbelltown, the extremely limited impact of non-European migration in much of the region, and the limited attachment of many residents to a &# 8216;sense of place&# 8217;. Here, it often seems, no one is &# 8216;rusted on&# 8217; to anything more ancient than the foundation of their local neighbourhood centre. More than a third of those Western Sydney residents interviewed by the Urban Frontiers researchers had moved into their neighbourhood in the last five years. And more than a half (rising to almost 70 per cent among the young) envisaged that they would move on from Western Sydney at some point. Take Penrith, for example&# 8230; Perhaps even more striking is the example of Penrith, some twenty or thirty kilometres to the north-west. Wind along the confusion of two-lane roads which substitute for a radial road network in Western Sydney to the base of the Blue Mountains, and you will find yourself in the orderly conurbation that centres upon Penrith and St Marys. In the early 1990 s Lindsay, the federal seat here, was imagined by many electoral observers to be Safe Labor. No more. In 1993 Labor still dominated the two-party-preferred vote 60 per cent to 39 per cent. In the 1996 poll, on One Nation&# 8217;s first outing, Labor&# 8217;s primary vote collapsed by more than 18 per cent, and the Liberals&# 8217; Jackie Kelly won on One Nation preferences with a modest buffer. While Labor&# 8217;s primary vote has recovered somewhat, the two-party-preferred drift has continued ever since, and Lindsay is now not too far from becoming Safe Liberal. Prior to the 1998 federal poll, which attached Lindsay reasonably securely to the Liberals for the first time, the National Tertiary Education Union commissioned Saulwick to conduct <b>detailed</b> <b>opinion</b> polling in the electorate. The results, from the union&# 8217;s perspective, were rather chastening. Few among those interviewed ranked tertiary education as an issue of great importance, despite the presence of university campuses in the locality. The great bulk of those who were concerned about the issue were self-identified Labor supporters. This is less than surprising given that, according to the research, Labor supporters in Lindsay are actually more likely than Coalition supporters to have completed a tertiary degree. Conversely, One Nation&# 8217;s support was strongest among those residents who had left high school before Year 12. In short, there was a strong correlation between education levels and voting patterns - but a correlation directly inverse to that which one might have expected to find in Western Sydney a generation ago. Number-crunching after the 2001 poll by the market-research firm Australian Development Strategies suggests that the trend noticed in Lindsay in 1998 is not an isolated one. ADS notes significant swings to Labor nationally among those holding tertiary qualifications, and surmises, reasonably enough, that it was these groups who responded most favourably to the Knowledge Nation package. Such a swing has relatively little consequence in Lindsay. Conversely, Labor&# 8217;s vote fell most markedly among tradespeople and middle-level mortgage-payers - two groups heavily over-represented in the Penrith area as a whole. Jackie Kelly was a conspicuously unsuccessful federal minister, and anyone who has endured one of her public addresses will be keenly aware of her limited political repertoire. Yet in Lindsay her personal popularity seems almost boundless. The reasons are perhaps not too hard to find. Kelly is a former New Zealand army officer who lost a technical challenge against her election in 1996, on the grounds that she had failed to take out Australian citizenship. In the by-election which followed her vote increased once more, at the expense of her competent but decidedly donnish Labor opponent, Ross Free. In the process she became a more moderate local version of Pauline Hanson: a personable, unremarkable but hard-working young woman who could claim to have overcome the obstacles placed in her path by clever CBD lawyers and well-scrubbed Labor advisers. Yet the official campaign posters of her 2001 Labor opponent, David Bradbury, contrived to make him look unnervingly like an identikit portrait of, well, a clever young CBD lawyer and well-scrubbed ministerial adviser. Clearly Labor has some work to do in the choice of its candidates here. At first blush Penrith is a solidly blue-collar town, loosely woven together out of a patchwork of struggling flat-dwellers, prospering tradespeople and cashed-up evacuees from the newly-gentrified inner-city searching for the great Australian backyard. Here the hoon&# 8217;s car of choice is still the souped-up V 8 Falcon, rather than the customised Subaru WRX. And in the liquor stores bourbon walks out the door a good deal quicker than bottled red wine. Yet the cultural antennae of the inner-city observer, so finely-tuned to the frequencies of real estate and renovation, can easily lose reception here. There are roads full of fibro cottages and those &# 8216; 60 s units, sure enough, but there are also broad streets lined with grandiose red-brick mansions with vast crew-cut lawns and cement front porticos, and in some neighbourhoods there are more backyard swimming-pools than you could poke a skimmer at. And the apparently homogenous topography now resounds to the real-estate agent&# 8217;s mantra of Position, Position, Position. Werrington Downs is definitely not Werrington. Image-wise, Emu Plains is more than a quick burn away from South Penrith. There are rural enclaves around Orchard Hills where the National Party would poll handsomely. Take the train three stops up to Glenbrook, in the foothills of the Blue Mountains, and you are suddenly in a countrified version of Sydney&# 8217;s North Shore. Stroll through the town centre and these complexities become easier to understand. Once the prime shopping strip was the long die-straight course of High St, with its shabby arcades and its narrow footpath. But in the 1980 s the vast emporium and car-park of Penrith Plaza was born, and almost instantly the rest of retail Penrith emptied itself into this vast suburban Crystal Palace, leaving the surrounding streets to the wholesale fabric dealers and the tattoo joints. On a Thursday night you can wander through the rest of Penrith almost unobserved, but stroll through the electric doors of the Plaza and you are assailed with a wall of sound and light. Of course there are all the routine talismen of the suburban shopping-centre: sportswear shops stocked to the rafters with Nike and Adidas, temporary stalls selling fluoro mobile-phone covers, men&# 8217;s clothes shops stacked with $ 100 suits and polyester polo-shirts, and long trestle-tables laid out with not-so-kosher budget CDs. But there&# 8217;s also an ABC Shop with specials on BBC TV-chefs, a Body Shop with tasteful little agitprop placards, and a gourmet deli which sells salted anchovies and prosciutto by the chunk. The made-over Grace Bros now smells of pot-pourri and perfume, and the homeware shop displays $ 700 coffee-makers in the window. All the little tokens of inner-city sophistication are insinuating themselves, one by one. Like the other main conurbations of the outer-west, Penrith is a city of new arrivals. Back in the early 90 s the local rugby league football team, the Panthers, won the premiership and the region was briefly swamped in bunting. But grab a seat in the local stadium on match day now and it&# 8217;s obvious how well the locals are reconciled to the possibility of defeat. The cheering and booing alike is curiously subdued: even the referee gets an easy time of it. On weekday evenings the first-grade players train in a neighbouring park without arousing evident interest. After more than thirty years in the &# 8216;elite&# 8217; competition the players and fans alike still feel like well-behaved newcomers. More influential than their football team, so far as the locality is concerned, are the licensed club which bears the team&# 8217;s name, and the all-pervasive network of local and junior sporting clubs which prosper in its shadow. The licensed club, which now prefers to be called &# 8216;Panthers World of Entertainment&# 8217;, makes the 20, 000 -seat football stadium look like a neighbourhood basketball court. Opened in the 1950 s by a local footballer&# 8217;s wife out of the proceeds of a lottery win, it shed its footballing cocoon in the 90 s and took wing first as the state&# 8217;s largest licensed premises, and now as a diversified business empire spanning the entire outer-west and rural NSW. The headquarters at Penrith is a veritable entertainment-industry Palace of Versailles, complete with statuary and fountains; the grounds boast an Aqua Golf course, a waterski park and 200 acres of cycling and walking tracks. The parking lot is itself one of Penrith&# 8217;s major meeting-places for local young people, and on Friday nights it echoes to the dull growl of dozens of over-tuned engines circling around and around in first gear. Bowling alone? Everybody nowadays champions the virtue of community. In the hands of political scientists the term often acquires a misty aura of post- 1960 s &# 8216;activism&# 8217;, urban environmentalism and civic planning. Out here the reality is decidedly less heroic. The Urban Frontiers survey found that a third of those residents of the region who volunteer do so in the name of their local church, while another third do so through a local sporting club. No other institutions rated so much as a blip on the radar. In the Penrith area the Panthers empire constitutes one of these two poles, while the other belongs to the region&# 8217;s growing crop of humble-looking evangelical churches, whose parishioners have renounced corporate denominational loyalty for personal scriptural commitment. The huge illuminated panther, glowing on the highway like the invitation to a vast celestial motel, perhaps stands as a marker of those primal regional virtues of family, friends and locality. The string of squat structures with their winking illuminated crosses likewise serve as markers to the region&# 8217;s characteristic sober-minded personal independence. Neither sits easily with Labor&# 8217;s new generous-spirited cosmopolitanism. Labor has a lot of learning to do.
