40|$|Expectations {{are high}} that the Physical Internet (PI) will {{contribute}} substantially to {{the improvement of}} transport chains’ efficiency and therefore to a swift reduction of freight transport related emissions. However, the PI’s ecological superiority {{still needs to be}} proven in reality. Moreover, in a synchro modal hyper-network, where routing management is decentralized, mechanisms need to be implemented that support emission minimization, both for individual flows as well as on a systems level. A standardized <b>emission</b> <b>calculation</b> tool for measuring emissions of freight transport chains ex-ante as well as ex-post is therefore necessary. Over the past decade, various approaches toward such a standard have been developed. This paper analyzes whether the currently existing approaches of <b>emission</b> <b>calculation</b> standardization are able to provide the necessary evaluations and whether they are equally able to support a successful steering of transport within the PI, so that lower emissions of freight transport can be realized compared to today’s freight transport system.

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{discussed}} possible ways {{of implementing}} effective energy conservation and GHG emission reduction measures by providing: the forecasts of mid-to-long term city-wide carbon emission rate; and {{the analysis of}} potential low-carbon transport solutions. Design/methodology/approach: According to {{the characteristics of the}} transport system in Beijing, based on the review and application analysis of existing transport energy and GHG <b>emission</b> <b>calculation</b> models, the comprehensive carbon <b>emission</b> <b>calculation</b> model established. Existing data were utilized with regression analysis to project the prospective traffic data in the baseline scenario at the target year of 2020 to calculate the emission amount. Four low-carbon scenarios were set in accordance with the goal of “low carbon transportation, green trip”, and the effectiveness of each low-carbon scenario was evaluated by comparing them with the baseline scenario in terms of the respective GHG emission rate. Findings: Under the current developing trend in policy environment and technical specifications, the total projected GHG (CO 2) emissions from transport sector at 2020 in Beijing will reach 24. 69 million t CO 2; private-vehicle is the major contributor among all transport modes at 15. 96 million t CO 2. Practical implications: Limiting the growth in private-vehicle ownership, reducing the frequency of mid-to-long range travel and the average trip distance, and prompting the public transit oriented policies are all possible solutions to reduce carbon emission. The most effective practice involves a shift in public travel behavior. Originality/value: This paper presents a method to forecast the mid-to-long term city-wide carbon emission rate; and provides some potential low-carbon transport solutions. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

In order to better represent the congestion phenomenon and the temporal and spatial evolution of traffic flow, we use a dynamic traffic assignment model, LADTA, to compute the traffic flow at street resolution.

The traffic flow outputs of LADTA are then coupled with COPERT model to calculate emissions of air pollutants(nitrogen oxides NOx for example). A sensitivity study is then carried out by varying the input parameters in the traffic emission modeling chain: the total traffic volume injected into the network, the average speed, the vehicle fleet composition, etc. The study shows that the emissions are very sensitive to these factors, especially during the transition from a free traffic network to a congested one...|$|R
