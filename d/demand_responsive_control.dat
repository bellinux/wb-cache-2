50|$|The modern {{power grid}} {{is making a}} {{transition}} from the traditional vertically integrated utility structures to distributed systems as we begin to integrate higher penetrations of renewable energy generation. These sources of energy are often diffusely distributed and intermittent by nature. These features introduce problems in grid stability and efficiency which lead to limitations {{on the amount of}} these resources which can be effectively added to the grid. In a traditional vertically integrated grid, energy is provided by utility generators which are able to respond to changes in demand. Generation output by renewable resources is governed by environmental conditions and is generally not able to respond to changes in <b>demand.</b> <b>Responsive</b> <b>control</b> over non-critical loads which are connected to the grid {{has been shown to be}} an effective strategy which is able to mitigate harmful fluctuations introduced by these renewable resources. In this way instead of letting the generation respond to changes in demand, we have the demand respond to changes in generation. This is the basis of demand response. In order to implement demand response systems, we must be able to coordinate large numbers of distributed resources through sensors, actuators, and communications protocols. To be effective, the devices need to be economical, robust, and yet still effective at managing their tasks of control. In addition, a strong control mechanism must be created which is able to coordinate over large networks of devices to manage and optimize these distributed systems both from an economic standpoint and a security standpoint in grid stabilization.|$|E
40|$|Traffic signal {{control is}} {{commonly}} used at road intersections to minimise vehicular delay. Fixed time control shows good results in conditions {{where there is a}} little fluctuation in traffic demand, however in time-varying traffic fixed time control becomes inflexible and inefficient. This may produce traffic congestion and lead to increased delays and air pollution. <b>Demand</b> <b>responsive</b> traffic signal <b>control</b> must be introduced to overcome these problems. However, all the available <b>demand</b> <b>responsive</b> traffic signal <b>control</b> methods such as Vehicle Actuated Controller (VAC), Traffic Optimisation Logic (TOL), Microprocessor Optimised Vehicle Actuation (MOVA) and Fuzzy Logic Traffic Signal Controllers (FLTSC) have been developed for non-mixed traffic conditions, considering only motor vehicles move in clearly defined lanes, neglecting motorcycles. These <b>demand</b> <b>responsive</b> traffic signal <b>controls</b> are not appropriate for the mixed traffic conditions of developing countries such as Indonesia, where the traffic streams consist of different types of vehicle with a wide variation in their static, dynamic and operating characteristics, and with a particularly high proportion (30...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{considers}} traffic assignment, {{with traffic}} controls, {{in an increasingly}} dynamic way. First, a natural way of introducing the responsive policy, Po, into steady state traffic assignment is presented. Then it is shown that natural stability results follow within a dynamical version of this static equilibrium model (still with a constant demand). We are able to obtain similar stability results when queues are explicitly allowed for, provided demand is constant. Finally we allow demand to vary with time; we consider the dynamic assignment problem with signal-settings now fixed. Here we assume that vehicles are very short and that deterministic queueing theory applies, and show that the time-dependent queueing delay at the bottleneck {{at the end of}} a link is a monotone function of the time-dependent input profile to the bottleneck. We have been unable to obtain results when dynamic <b>demand</b> and <b>responsive</b> signal <b>control</b> are combined. ...|$|R

When designing such a service, {{it is important to}} analyse and evaluate how the attractiveness and operating costs for the service depend on the type of <b>demand</b> <b>responsive</b> service used, the design parameters related to the fleet of vehicles, the structure of the transportation network and on the personal service commitments made to the passengers. In this paper, we show how simulation can be used to perform these analyses. The performed simulations also give guidelines to help operators of public transport to design the service. The evaluation is made using the LlTRES- 2 public transport modelling system.

This kind of service is related to the dial-a-ride problem. However, in order {{to improve the quality of}} service, <b>demand</b> <b>responsive</b> transport needs more flexibility. This paper tries to address this issue by proposing an original evolutionary approach. In order to propose a set of compromise solutions to the decision-maker, this approach optimizes three objectives concurrently. Moreover, in order to intensify the search process, this multi-objective evolutionary approach is hybridized with a local search. Results obtained on random and realistic problems are detailed to compare three state-of-the-art algorithms and discussed from an operational point of view.

An important way of improving existing transit services is to use innovative propulsive systems; however, this needs considerable financial resources that are not always available. Here we assess how the organizational form of the transit system may impact the environment relying on a new methodology that permits comparisons in terms of distance traveled between a traditional fixed-route and a <b>demand</b> <b>responsive</b> transit service. We apply an emission model to find the least polluting transit system under a broad range of scenarios with different road networks, service quality levels and demand densities. Results indicate that <b>demand</b> <b>responsive</b> transit services minimize emissions for high quality service level and low demand density scenarios. Furthermore, the possibility of employing smaller vans with lower emission factors guarantees additional substantial benefits in terms of atmospheric pollution for <b>demand</b> <b>responsive</b> transit services, thereby giving them a competitive advantage in virtually every case...|$|R
