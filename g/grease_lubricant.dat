40|$|Abstract. The {{characteristics}} of the 1045 steel pairs using serpentine particles as <b>grease</b> <b>lubricant</b> additive were investigated by an AMSLER friction and wear tester. The surface topographies and composition of the worn surface of 1045 steel rings were identified by SEM and XPS. The {{results show that the}} additives can form a self-repairing film on the worn metal surface. It can reduce the abrasion of the friction pairs significantly. The main elemental compositions of the film are Fe, O, Si, C and Mg, which indicates that the additives directly take part {{in the formation of the}} self-repairing film...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{concerns}} {{the research on}} self-organization of the surface of coating of hypoeutectic alloy Fe-Mn-C-B modified Si, Ni, Cr, Cu with friction with C 45 steel. The coatings were obtained by arc welding using a flux-cored wire. Tests of resistance to wear were carried out for hypoeutectic coatings with use of the friction pair pin-on-disc in the conditions of sliding friction, in model lubricating environments. The surface-active (glycerol oil) and inactive (Vaseline <b>grease)</b> <b>lubricant</b> was used. Tribological tests carried out showed that cooperation of hypoeutectic alloy coating with counterbody of C 45 steel with lubrication with surface-active lubricant results in a significant improvement in tribological properties than in case of the lubrication with surface-inactive lubricant. The resulting effect {{is related to the}} self-organization of friction surface. After deposition and wear resistance tests, the friction surface microstructure was analysed, as well as the surface and depth distribution of the elements...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a novel {{interactive}} friction-lubricant thickness {{model was}} developed to predict the evolution of coefficient of friction and the useful life of lubricant film. The developed model was calibrated by experimental results determined from pin-on-disc tests. For these experiments, a <b>grease</b> <b>lubricant</b> was applied on a Tungsten Carbide ball which slides against a disc made from AA 6082 Aluminium alloy. In the pin-on-disc tests, the lubricant film thickness decreased with time during single path sliding leading to a rapid increase in the coefficient of friction. The breakdown of lubricant was divided into three stages, namely, the Stage I low and stable coefficient of friction region, Stage II region in which the coefficient of friction sees a rapid rise, and Stage III in which the coefficient of friction reaches a plateau with a value {{similar to that of}} dry sliding. In order to characterise the evolution of coefficient of friction throughout these stages, a novel interactive friction model was developed combining the effects of sliding distance, sliding speed, contact pressure and initial lubricant amount on the evolution of the coefficient of friction. This interactive friction model can be applied to situations involving lubricant breakdown in a dynamic environment such as the metal forming industry, where the use of traditional constant coefficient of friction values present limits in predictive accuracy...|$|E

40|$|A Lamb wave-based {{technique}} {{was developed for}} detecting damages in metallic structures, such as cracks and holes in metallic beams and plates. For metallic structures with transverse cracks and holes, A 0 mode of Lamb waves was employed due to its shorter wave length compared with S 0 mode, which leads to high sensitivity to small damages. Two kinds of excitation techniques for generating comparatively pure A 0 mode using piezoelectric lead zirconate titanate (PZT) actuators were realized experimentally. In one technique, two PZT actuators with applied out-of-phase voltages were attached {{on both sides of}} the structures. While in the other technique, a kind of <b>grease</b> <b>lubricant</b> was used between the bottom surface of one PZT actuator and the surface of the specimens. Both techniques were able to enhance the component of A 0 mode and reduce the component of S 0 mode effectively. Secondly, in terms of the arrival time of the A 0 wave mode reflected from damages obtained using the wavelet analysis, the positions of damages were identified accurately. The above two techniques were then validated by identifying the transverse cracks and holes in aluminum beams and plates, respectively. Numerical simulations using the finite element method (FEM) for the wave propagation in these structures with damages were carried out. The obtained experimental and numerical results demonstrate that it is possible to identify damage position very accurately by using only sensor data of defective structures without referring benchmark signals (sensor data of intact structures) ...|$|E
