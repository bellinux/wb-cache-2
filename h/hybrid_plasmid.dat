The {{presence of the}} two plasmids confer on the cell a "killer" character, due {{to the production of}} a toxin that kills the sensitive cells. We have used one of these linear DNA molecules as a gene vector to transform K. lactis cells. <b>Hybrid</b> <b>plasmids</b> containing parts of the k 1 plasmid and the URA 3 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been constructed. We have found that the <b>hybrid</b> <b>plasmids</b> were able to transform a uracil-requiring strain of K. lactis (uraA mutant) to a prototrophic form.

40|$|A {{method has}} been {{developed}} whereby {{a very large number}} of colonies of Escherichia coli carrying different <b>hybrid</b> <b>plasmids</b> can be rapidly screened to determine which <b>hybrid</b> <b>plasmids</b> contain a specified DNA sequence or genes. The colonies to be screened are formed on nitrocellulose filters, and, after a reference set of these colonies has been prepared by replica plating, are lysed and their DNA is denatured and fixed to the filter in situ. The resulting DNA-prints of the colonies are then hybridized to a radioactive RNA that defines the sequence or gene of interest, and the result of this hybridization is assayed by autoradiography. Colonies whose DNA-prints exhibit hybridization can then be picked from the reference plate. We have used this method to isolate clones of ColE 1 <b>hybrid</b> <b>plasmids</b> that contain Drosophila melanogaster genes for 18 and 28 S rRNAs. In principle, the method can be used to isolate any gene whose base sequence is represented in an available RNA...|$|R

The resulting <b>hybrid</b> <b>plasmids</b> not only correct {{the lack of}} in vitro synthase activity in pgsA strains but also cause an amplification (6 - to 40 -fold over wild-type levels) in enzymatic activity {{in direct proportion to}} the copy number of the plasmids found in vivo. The cloned gene also corrects the abnormally low level of polyglycerophosphatides found in pgsA strains and actually increases the level of phosphatidylglycerol to above that normally found in E. coli. The degree of alteration in phospholipid composition brought about by these <b>hybrid</b> <b>plasmids</b> is not of the order expected if fluctuations in enzyme levels in vivo were an important regulatory mechanism in phospholipid metabolism. The isolated <b>hybrid</b> <b>plasmids</b> have been mapped by restriction endonuclease analysis. The presence and location of other genetic markers have also been established. The above data, along with analysis of deletion derivatives of these plasmids and subcloning of appropriate restriction fragments, have established the position of the pgsA locus on the <b>hybrid</b> <b>plasmids.</b> From this data, the position of the pgsA locus has been determined to le between flaI and uvrC on the E. coli genetic map...|$|R

40|$|Hybrid {{plasmids}} {{consisting of}} the bacterial plasmid pBR 322 and plasmid-like DNA (pl DNA) sequences from the fungus Podospora anserina are not only able to replicate in Escherichia coli {{but also in the}} fungus. This was proved by both biophysical and biological evidence involving buoyant density profiles, DNA. DNA hybridization, and restriction analysis [...] all confirming that pl DNA behaves as a true plasmid. During its amplification in P. anserina, the <b>hybrid</b> <b>plasmid</b> does not lose its prokaryotic coding capacity as shown after retransfer and subsequent cloning in E. coli. P. anserina is able to express both the eukaryotic and the prokaryotic genetic information of the <b>hybrid</b> <b>plasmid</b> because the occurrence of senescence and the production of beta-lactamase could be shown in experiments involving specific hybrid plasmids. In the same systems, it was possible to demonstrate that a <b>hybrid</b> <b>plasmid</b> containing, instead of pl DNA, a pl DNA homologous region of native mtDNA also could function as a true plasmid. This <b>hybrid</b> <b>plasmid</b> contained about 25 % of the genetic information pl DNA, which corresponds to about 6 % of the genetic information of mtDNA. Thus, the data show that hybrid plasmids may be used to shuttle genetic information between P. anserina and E. coli. hence, {{through the use of a}} mtDNA replicon, as evidenced by the pl DNA of P. anserina, another pathway in genetic engineering is established...|$|E
40|$|Anacystis nidulans R 2 is {{a highly}} transformable strain which is {{suitable}} as a recipient for molecular cloning in cyanobacteria. In an effort to produce an appropriate cloning vector, we constructed a <b>hybrid</b> <b>plasmid</b> molecule, pSG 111, which contained pBR 328 from Escherichia coli and the native pUH 24 plasmid of A. nidulans. pSG 111 replicated in and conferred ampicillin and chloramphenicol resistance to both hosts.

The stability of the sbcB <b>hybrid</b> <b>plasmids</b> and their effects on exonuclease I activity have also been determined in wild-type and recA 1 genetic backgrounds. The presence of the plasmids results in a 7 -fold increase in the level of exonuclease I in a wild-type strain and 15 -fold increase in a recA 1 strain.

Analysis by limited proteolysis indicated that the two polypeptides are related, and a number of observations support the notion that the 61, 000 -dalton protein is a precursor form of the 59, 000 -dalton mature exported protein. The identification and characterization of a protein, in addition to Trg, which is produced by a gene in close proximity to terC emphasizes the fact that the region does contain intact and active genes...|$|R

Cloning and DNA sequence analysis of the E. coli B/r replication origin revealed several base differences {{as compared to the}} E. coli K 12 sequence. The replication origin of temperature sensitive fast growing mutants, originating from a homologous exchange between chromosomal and plasmid DNA sequences were also cloned. Sequence data showed that a single base change within the promoter of the 16 kD gene of these dnaA (Ts) strains is able to suppress the inhibition of chromosomal DNA replication by the mentioned pBR 322 <b>hybrid</b> <b>plasmids.</b> Our results strongly indicate a role of the 16 kD gene promoter in control of initiation of chromosomal DNA replication...|$|R
40|$|Restriction {{analysis}} of <b>hybrid</b> <b>plasmids</b> {{from a number}} of clones allowed to screen out the plasmid p 8 - 1. A detailed {{analysis of}} this plasmid and that of the inserted DNA was made using HhaII, AluI, Sau 96 I, Sau 3 A, MspI and BspI restriction endonucleases. The results demonstrated that the inserted DNA corresponds to the 3 '-nontranslated region and to a portion of the C fragment of the light-chain immunoglobulin gene. Establishing the partial structure of the recombinant plasmid exhibited a complete coincidence of the inserted DNA 3 '-terminus and the primary structure of the light-chain mRNA synthesized by MOPC- 21 myeloma cells. This sequence corresponds to the amino acid sequence in the light-chain constant region (207 - 214 residues). The analysis of p 8 - 1 plasmid showed that nucleotides of pBR 322 plasmid at positions from 376 to 618 were deleted.

Plasmid pA 387 is about 29. 6 kb and can be cured at low frequency by protoplasting and ethidium bromide and heat treatment. Hybridization experiments showed that this plasmid is present in free form and does not integrate into the chromosome. A <b>hybrid</b> <b>plasmid</b> was constructed by cloning a 5. 1 -kb fragment of pA 387 into the Escherichia coli vector pDM 10.

After Tn 5 transposon mutagenesis, restriction endonuclease analysis, and DNA-DNA hybridization, two DNA fragments, a 9. 5 -kb KpnI fragment and a 13. 5 -kb HindIII fragment (HKI), were isolated. HKI contained EK 1, the KpnI fragment, as a subfragment flanked on both sides by short regions. Both fragments were ligated into the suicide vector pSUP 202, the broad-host-range vector pVK 101, and pUC 19.
