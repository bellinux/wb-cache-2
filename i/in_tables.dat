40|$|In {{order to}} deal with the incompleteness of {{information}} exchanges for Uighur, Kazakh, Kirghiz and Arabic languages and occurrence of double ambiguous code, it is quite necessary to supplement Uighur, Kazakh, Kirghiz letters <b>in</b> <b>table</b> 1 - 2.

With the addition of Lita, the team became known as Team Xtreme and continued to rise in popularity.

In 1997, Copeland signed a developmental deal with the WWF and began competing for the company later that year; he made his televised debut the following June under the ring name Edge. In July 1999, he won the WWF Intercontinental Championship at a house show in Toronto, making it his first title reign with the company. He and Christian, billed as brothers and later childhood friends in WWF/WWE storylines, {{went on to win}} the WWF Tag Team Championship on seven different occasions.

In 1998, Reso signed a developmental deal with the World Wrestling Federation and was rebranded as the storyline brother of Edge, Copeland's WWF persona. Reso made his debut the following year and immediately captured his first title in the company, the WWF Light Heavyweight Championship. He and Edge gained notoriety as a tag team for their participation <b>in</b> <b>Tables,</b> Ladders, and Chairs matches and winning the WWF Tag Team Championship on seven different occasions.

Results from the final tournaments, play-off matches and friendly games were all ignored. As host country, Portugal were unranked and automatically placed in Group A.

25|$|Babbage's {{motivation}} to overcome errors <b>in</b> <b>tables</b> by mechanisation {{has been a}} commonplace since Dionysius Lardner wrote about it in 1834 in the Edinburgh Review (under Babbage's guidance). The context of these developments is still debated. Babbage's own account {{of the origin of}} the difference engine begins with the Astronomical Society's wish to improve The Nautical Almanac. Babbage and Herschel were asked to oversee a trial project, to recalculate some part of those tables. With the results to hand, discrepancies were found. This was in 1821 or 1822, and was the occasion on which Babbage formulated his idea for mechanical computation. The issue of the Nautical Almanac is now described as a legacy of a polarisation in British science caused by attitudes to Sir Joseph Banks, who had died in 1820.|$|E
