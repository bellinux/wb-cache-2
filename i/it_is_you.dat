"Ultraviolet (Light My Way)" [...] {{began as}} two {{different}} demos, one variously called [...] "Ultraviolet" [...] and [...] "69" [...] (which eventually {{evolved into the}} B-side [...] "Lady with the Spinning Head") and an alternately arranged demo called [...] "Light My Way". Over {{the course of the}} recording sessions, U2 added various overdubs to the song, but producer Brian Eno believed these additions negatively impacted the track. Eno aided the group in editing down the song, and he explained his assistance as such: [...] "I'd go in and say, 'The song has gone, whatever <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>you</b> liked about this song is not there anymore. Sometimes, for example, the song would have disappeared under layers of overdubs." ...|$|E

500|$|Following Houpouët-Boigny's death, the country's {{stability}} was maintained, {{as seen by}} his impressive funeral on 7 February 1994. The {{funeral for}} this [...] "doyen of francophone Africa" [...] {{was held in the}} Basilica of Our Lady of Peace, with 7,000 guests inside the building and tens of thousands outside. The two-month delay before Houpouët-Boigny's funeral, common among members of the Baoule ethnic group, allowed for many ceremonies preceding his burial. The president's funeral featured many traditional African funerary customs, including a large chorus dressed in bright batik dresses singing [...] "laagoh budji gnia" [...] (Baoulé: [...] "Lord, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>you</b> who has made all things") and village chiefs displaying strips of kente and korhogo cloth. Baoulés are traditionally buried with objects they enjoyed while alive; Houpouët-Boigny's family, however, did not state what, if anything, they would bury with him.|$|E
500|$|As {{characters}} {{from the previous}} chapters of the game gather around to congratulate him, Conker realizes {{that he should have}} brought Berri back to life when he was negotiating with programmers. He calls them out to bring her back to life, only to realize that they have left already. Conker then gives a closing monologue, in which he discusses appreciating what one already has instead of always wanting more, stating that [...] "the grass is always greener, and you don't really know what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>you</b> have until it's gone." [...] The credits roll, and afterwards Conker is seen back at the same pub he was seen in {{at the start of the}} game, drowning his sorrows in Scotch whisky. He drunkenly exits the bar as it begins to storm outside, and leaves in the direction opposite the one he took previously.|$|E
500|$|David Julyan {{composed}} the film's synthesized score. Julyan acknowledges several synthesized soundtracks that inspired him, such as Vangelis's Blade Runner and Hans Zimmer's The Thin Red Line. While composing the score, Julyan created different, distinct sounds {{to differentiate between}} the color and black-and-white scenes: [...] "brooding and classical" [...] themes in the former, and [...] "oppressive and rumbly noise" [...] in the latter. Since he describes the entire score as [...] "Leonard's theme", Julyan says, [...] "The emotion I was aiming at with my music was yearning and loss. But {{a sense of loss}} you feel {{but at the same time}} you don't know what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>you</b> have lost, a sense of being adrift." [...] Initially, Nolan wanted to use Radiohead's [...] "Paranoid Android" [...] during the end credits, but he was unable to secure the rights. Instead, David Bowie's [...] "Something in the Air" [...] is used, although another of Radiohead's songs, an extended version of [...] "Treefingers", is included on the film's soundtrack.|$|E

500|$|Keenan and Jones {{met through}} {{a mutual friend}} in 1989. After Keenan played a tape {{recording}} for Jones of his previous band project, Jones was so impressed by his voice that he eventually talked his friend into forming their own band. They started jamming together and were {{on the lookout for}} a drummer and a bass player. Carey happened to live above Keenan and was introduced to Jones by Tom Morello, an old high school friend of Jones and former member of Electric Sheep. Carey began playing in their sessions because he [...] "felt kinda sorry for them," [...] as other invited musicians were not showing up. Tool's lineup was completed when a friend of Jones introduced them to bassist D'Amour. Early on, the band fabricated the story that they formed because of the pseudophilosophy [...] "lachrymology". Although [...] "lachrymology" [...] was also cited as an inspiration for the band's name, Keenan later explained their intentions differently: [...] "Tool is exactly what it sounds like: It's a big dick. It's a wrench. ... we are ... your tool; use us as a catalyst in your process of finding out whatever <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>you</b> need to find out, or whatever it is you're trying to achieve." ...|$|E
500|$|Weisman's science journalism style uses {{interviews}} with academic and professional authorities to substantiate conclusions, {{while maintaining the}} [...] "cool and dispassionate ...of a scientific observer rather than an activist". Weisman said he purposely avoided the activist label: [...] "Some of our finest science and nature writers only get read by people who already agree with them. It's nice to get some affirmation for whatever <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>you</b> believe is true, even if it's quite sobering, but I wanted to write something that people would read ... without minimizing the significance of what's going on, nor trivializing it, nor oversimplifying it." [...] Richard Fortey compares the book to the works of Jared Diamond, Tim Flannery and E.O. Wilson, and writes that The World Without Us [...] "narrowly avoids engendering the gloom-and-doom ennui that tends to engulf the poor reader after reading a catalogue of human rapacity". Mark Lynas in the New Statesman noted that [...] "whereas most environmental books sag {{under the weight of}} their accumulated bad news, The World Without Us seems refreshingly positive". Demonstrating the optimism on the grim subject matter Appleton quotes an ecologist from the book saying [...] "if the planet can recover from the Permian, it can recover from the human".|$|E
500|$|Some of {{the cast}} was not happy with Fincher's {{exacting}} ways and perfectionism. Some scenes required upwards of 70 takes. [...] Gyllenhaal was frustrated by the director's methods and commented in an interview, [...] "You get a take, 5 takes, 10 takes. Some places, 90 takes. But there is a stopping point. There's {{a point at which}} you go, 'That's what we have to work with.' But we would reshoot things. So there came a point where I would say, well, what do I do? Where's the risk?" [...] Downey said, [...] "I just decided, aside from several times I wanted to garrote him, that I was going to give him what he wanted. I think I'm a perfect person to work for him, because I understand gulags". Fincher responded, [...] "If an actor is going to let the role come to them, they can't resent the fact that I'm willing to wait as long as that takes. You know, the first day of production in San Francisco we shot 56 takes of Mark and Jake – and it's the 56th take that's in the movie". Ruffalo also backed up his director's methods when he said, [...] "The way I see <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> <b>you</b> enter into someone else's world as an actor. You can put your expectations aside and have an experience that's new and pushes and changes you, or hold on to what you think it should be and have a stubborn, immovable journey that's filled with disappointment and anger." ...|$|E
