Adjining the Bareacre proppaty is {{a small piece of}} land of about 100 acres, called Squallop Hill, igseeding {{advantageous}} for the cultivation of sheep, which have been found to have a pickewlear fine flaviour from the natur of the grass, tyme, heather, and other hodarefarus plants which grows on that mounting in the places where the rox and stones don't prevent them. Thistles here is also remarkable fine, and the land is also <b>devided</b> hoff by luxurient Stone Hedges--much more usefle and ickonomicle than your quickset or any of that rubbishing sort of timber: indeed the sile is of that fine natur, that timber refuses to grow there altogether. I gave Bareacres 50L. an acre for this land (the igsact premium of my St. Helena Shares)--a very handsom price for land which never yielded two shillings an acre; and very convenient to his Lordship I know, who had a bill coming due at his Bankers which he had given them. James de la Pluche, Esquire, is thus for the fust time a landed propriator--or rayther, I should say, is about to reshume the rank & dignity in the country which his Hancestors so long occupied.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the factors that affect economic growth in the Province of Banten. This research was using the multiple linear regression analysis which is used to measured the pattern of the relationships between dependent variable and independent variables. The variable GRDP is a dependent variable and the independent variable are Income Original Region, General Allocation Fund, Fund <b>Devide</b> Result, Inflation, Foreign Investment, Domestic Investment, Government Spending and Labor. The estimation result of this model, showed that from 8 variables, there were 3 variables that insignificant which were inflation, foreign investment and domestic investment to influenced GRDP Province of Banten. Another five variables which were : Income Original Region, General Alocation fund, Fund <b>Devide</b> Result, Government spending and labour that significant to influenced GRDP. In the other hand, Goodness of fit of this model had a value of R² were 0, 9867. From this model about 98, 67 % the Independent variables Income Original Region, General Allocation Fund, Fund <b>Devide</b> Result, Inflation, Foreign Investment, Domestic Investment, Government Spending and Labor expalained the relationship to GRDP of Banten. And about 1, 32 % will be explained by another variables that not obtained in this model...|$|R

40|$|Dataflow {{application}} builders such as AVS, OpenDX and MeVisLab {{are popular}} and effective tools for the rapid prototyping of visualisation algorithms. They enable researchers to build applications by graphically connecting functional modules {{together to form}} a network. A usually hidden yet important aspect of these tools is the scheduling of network execution: Most of these environments can be classified as employing event-driven or demand-driven scheduling. The scheduling strategy has important implications for the component developer. In this paper, we present our recently opensourced dataflow application builder, called <b>DeVIDE,</b> for the rapid prototyping of medical visualisation and image processing techniques. Apart from the unique interaction possibilities and ease of integration that it offers, <b>DeVIDE</b> differentiates itself from similar environments by implementing a hybrid scheduling approach that adaptively applies demand- and event-driven scheduling to a single network. In this way, ease of component development and execution efficiency can be combined...|$|R
