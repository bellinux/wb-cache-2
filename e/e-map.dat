5000|$|The {{choice of}} genes {{examined}} {{within a given}} <b>E-MAP</b> is critical to achieving fruitful results. It is particularly important that a significant subset of the genes examined have been well established in the literature. These genes are thus able to act as controls for the <b>E-MAP</b> allowing for greater certainty in analyzing the data from uncharacterized genes. Clusters organized by sub-cellular localization and general cellular processes (e.g. cell cycle) have yielded profitable results in S. cerevisiae. Data from protein-protein interaction studies can also provide a useful basis for selecting gene groups for <b>E-MAP</b> data. We would expect genes which exhibit physical interactions to also demonstrate interactions at the genetic level and thus these can serve as adequate controls for <b>E-MAP</b> data. Collins et al. (2007) carried out a comparison of <b>E-MAP</b> scores and physical interaction data from large-scale affinity purification methods (AP-MS) and their data demonstrate that an <b>E-MAP</b> approach identifies protein-protein interactions with a specificity {{equal to that of}} traditional methods such as AP-MS [...]|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} develop a richer {{understanding}} of genetic interactions, experimental approaches are shifting away from this binary classification of phenotypes as wild type or synthetic lethal. The <b>E-MAP</b> approach is particularly compelling because {{of its ability to}} highlight both alleviating and aggravating effects and this capacity is what distinguishes this method from others such as SGA and dSLAM. Furthermore, not only does the <b>E-MAP</b> identify both types of interactions but also recognizes gradations in these interactions and the severity of the masked phenotype, represented by the interaction score applied to each pair of genes.|$|E

This paper presents a case study on the use of a hybrid concept/mind mapping online strategy (<b>E-mapping)</b> to develop critical reading skills in first year Egyptian students enrolled at the American University in Cairo. Seventy students participated in the study and data were collected over two semesters. <b>E-maps</b> and assignment-specific rubrics were used to assess learning. Student feedback was collected via early and late semester surveys and a mid-semester assessment. Results show that <b>E-mapping</b> is a potentially powerful active learning tool which goes beyond developing strong reading skills and enhancing class participation. It enhances critical thinking and helps students acquire visualization skills by which they can communicate ideas using imagery. It is also an assessment tool that permits instructors to gain insight into their students’ analytical and synthetic skills.

5000|$|Generating {{data for}} the <b>E-MAP</b> depends upon the {{creation}} of thousands of double mutant strains; a study of 483 alleles, for example, resulted in an <b>E-MAP</b> with ~100,000 distinct double mutant pairs. The generation of libraries of essential gene mutants presents significant difficulties however, as these mutations have a lethal phenotype. Thus, <b>E-MAP</b> studies rely upon strains with intermediate expression levels of these genes. The decreased abundance by messenger RNA perturbation (DAmP) strategy is particularly common for the high-throughput generation of mutants necessary {{for this kind of}} analysis and allows for the partial disruption of essential genes without loss of viability. [...] DAmP relies upon the destabilization of mRNA transcripts by integrating an antibiotic selectable marker into the 3’UTR, downstream of the stop codon (figure 2). mRNA’s with 3’ extended transcripts are rapidly targeted for degradation and the result is a downregulation of the gene of interest while it remains under the control of its native promoter. In the case of non-essential genes, deletion strains may be used. Tagging at the deletion sites with molecular barcodes, unique 20-bp sequences, allows for the identification and study of relative fitness levels in each mutant strain.|$|E
5000|$|E-MAPs exploit an SGA {{approach}} {{in order to}} analyze genetic interactions in a high-throughput manner. While the method has been particularly developed for examining epistasis in S. cerevisiae, it {{could be applied to}} other model organisms as well. An <b>E-MAP</b> collates data generated from the systematic generation of double mutant strains for a large clearly defined group of genes. Each phenotypic response is quantified by imaging colony size to determine growth rate. This fitness score is compared to the predicted fitness for each single mutant, resulting in a genetic interaction score.Hierarchical clustering of this data to group genes with similar interaction profiles allows for the identification of epistatic relationships between genes with and without known function. By sorting the data in this way, genes known to interact will cluster together alongside genes which exhibit a similar pattern of interactions but whose function has not yet been identified. The <b>E-MAP</b> data is therefore able to place genes into new functions within well characterized pathways. Consider for example <b>E-MAP</b> presented by Collins et al. which clusters the transcriptional elongation factor Dst1 alongside components of the mid region of the Mediator complex, which is involved in transcriptional regulation. [...] This suggests a new role for Dst1, functioning in concert with Mediator.|$|E

Until now, {{there has been no}} reliable, systematic method to identify the cognate antigens of paraproteins. <b>E-MAP</b> is a variation of previous efforts to reconstruct the epitopes of paraproteins, with the significant difference that it provides enough epitope sequence data so as to enable successful protein database searches. We first reconstruct the paraprotein's epitope by analyzing the peptides that strongly bind. Then, we compile the data and interrogate the nonredundant protein database, searching for a close match. As a clinical proof-of-concept, we apply this technology to uncovering the protein targets of para-proteins in multiple myeloma (MM). <b>E-MAP</b> analysis of 2 MM paraproteins identified human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) as a target in both. <b>E-MAP</b> sequence analysis determined that one para-protein binds to the AD- 2 S 1 epitope of HCMV glycoprotein B.

40|$|AbstractEpistatic miniarray {{profiling}} (<b>E-MAP)</b> is {{a powerful}} tool for analyzing gene functions and their biological relevance.

Experimental results on five <b>E-MAP</b> datasets show that EMDI outperforms all single base algorithms, demonstrating an appropriate combination providing complementarity among different methods.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a Geo-information system (GIS) for Phobos, {{based on data from}} the Mars Express and Viking Orbiter missions, which includes orthoimages, global maps, terrain- and gravity field models, all referenced to the Phobos coordinate system. The data are conveniently stored in the ArcGIS software system, which provides an environment for mapping and which allows us to carry out joint data analysis and miscellaneous data cross-comparisons. We have compiled catalogs of Phobos craters using manual and automated techniques, which includes about 5500 and 6400 craters correspondingly. While crater numbers are biased by available image data resolution and illumination, we estimate that our catalog of manually detected craters contains all Phobos craters with diameters D> 250 m which is a total of 1072 and catalog of automated detected craters are complete for craters D> 400 m (360 craters). Statistical analysis of these large craters reveals a surplus of craters on the anti-Mars hemisphere, whereas differences in crater abundance between leading and trailing hemisphere cannot be confirmed. This in contrast to previous papers, where no such asymmetry was found (Schmedemann et al., 2014). But we cannot rule out remaining biases due to resolution, viewing angles or illumination effects. Using digital terrain model (DTM) derived from photogrammetry image processing we estimate depths of 25 craters larger than 2 km using geometric and dynamic heights (for discussion of Phobos crater morphometry see Kokhanov et al., 2014). We also have compiled catalogs of lineaments, and boulders. In particular, we mapped 546 individual grooves or crater chains, which extend in length from 0. 3 km to 16. 2 km.

Cross-comparisons of gravity field models against distribution patterns of grooves and boulders are currently under way and may shed light on their possible origins.

40|$|A popular {{large-scale}} {{gene interaction}} discovery platform is the Epistatic Miniarray Profile (<b>E-MAP).</b> E-MAPs benefit from quantitative output, {{which makes it}} possible to detect subtle interactions. However, due to the limits of biotechnology, <b>E-MAP</b> studies fail to measure genetic interactions for up to 40 % of gene pairs in an assay. Missing measurements can be recovered by computational techniques for data imputation, thus completing the interaction profiles and enabling downstream analysis algorithms that could otherwise be sensitive to largely incomplete data sets. We introduce a new interaction data imputation method called interaction propagation matrix completion (IP-MC). The core part of IP-MC is a low-rank (latent) probabilistic matrix completion approach that considers additional knowledge presented through a gene network. IP-MC assumes that interactions are transitive, such that latent gene interaction profiles depend on the profiles of their direct neighbors in a given gene network. As the IP-MC inference algorithm progresses, the latent interaction profiles propagate through the branches of the network. In a study with three different <b>E-MAP</b> data assays and the considered protein-protein interaction and Gene Ontology similarity networks, IP-MC significantly surpassed existing alternative techniques. Inclusion of information from gene networks also allows IP-MC to predict interactions for genes that were not included in original <b>E-MAP</b> assays, a task that could not be considered by current imputation approaches...|$|E
40|$|Background: Epistatic miniarray {{profiling}} (E-MAPs) is a high-throughput approach {{capable of}} quantifying aggravating or alleviating genetic interactions between gene pairs. The datasets resulting from <b>E-MAP</b> experiments typically {{take the form}} of a symmetric pairwise matrix of interaction scores. These datasets have a significant number of missing values- up to 35 %- that can reduce the effectiveness of some data analysis techniques and prevent the use of others. An effective method for imputing interactions would therefore increase the types of possible analysis, as well as increase the potential to identify novel functional interactions between gene pairs. Several methods have been developed to handle missing values in microarray data, but it is unclear how applicable these methods are to <b>E-MAP</b> data because of their pairwise nature and the significantly larger number of missing values. Here we evaluate four alternative imputation strategies, three local (Nearest neighbor-based) and one global (PCA-based), that have been modified to work with symmetric pairwise data. Results: We identify different categories for the missing data based on their underlying cause, and show that values from the largest category can be imputed effectively. We compare local and global imputation approaches across a variety of distinct <b>E-MAP</b> datasets, showing that both are competitive and preferable to filling in with zeros. In addition we show that these methods are effective in an <b>E-MAP</b> from a different species, suggesting that pairwise imputatio...|$|E
40|$|Epistatic or genetic interactions, {{representing}} {{the effects of}} mutations on the phenotypes caused by other mutations, can be very helpful for uncovering functional relationships between genes. Recently, the Epistasis Miniarray Profile (<b>E-MAP)</b> method {{has emerged as a}} powerful approach for identifying such interactions systematically. As part of this approach, hierarchical clustering is used to partition genes into groups {{on the basis of the}} similarity between their global interaction profiles. Here we present an original biclustering algorithm for identifying groups of functionally related genes from <b>E-MAP</b> data in a manner that allows individual genes to be assigned to more than one functional group. This enables investigation of the pleiotropic nature of gene function, a goal that cannot be achieved with hierarchical clustering. The performance of our algorithm is illustrated by applying it to two <b>E-MAP</b> datasets and an E-MAP-like in silico dataset for the yeast S. cerevisiae. In addition to identifying the majority of the functional modules reported in these studies, our algorithm uncovers many recently documented and novel multi-functional relationships between genes and gene groups...|$|E
