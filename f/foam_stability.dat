It was found that <b>foam</b> <b>stabilities</b> are controlled by both film elasticity and disjoining pressure, the relative contributions from each changing with frother type and concentration.

40|$|In many food products, such as meringues, beer or {{chocolate}} mousses, protein foams play {{an important}} structural and textural role. Wheat gluten proteins, a co-product of the industrial wheat starch isolation process, have very low solubility in water. Controlled enzymatic hydrolysis increases its solubility in aqueous media but also enhances the foaming properties. The air-water interfacial properties of wheat gluten hydrolysates were evaluated and related to their foaming properties. The use of such, for protein hydrolysates not very commonly used, techniques can be helpful to determine their air-water interfacial behavior in more complex media. <b>Foaming</b> capacity and <b>stability</b> of structurally different peptic and tryptic wheat gluten hydrolysates with degrees of hydrolysis (DH, i. e. the percentage of cleaved peptide bonds) of 2 and 6, {{were related to the}} kinetics of their adsorption at an air-water interface {{as well as to the}} properties of a compressed protein film at this interface. Foam formation increased with increasing protein concentration, as did the rate of adsorption to the air-water interface of all samples. Foams from DH 2 hydrolysates were more stable than those from their DH 6 counterparts, and this at all protein concentrations tested. However, at protein concentrations from 0. 010 % to 0. 050 % (wprot/v), peptic DH 2 and 6 hydrolysates had better <b>foaming</b> <b>stability</b> than their tryptic counterparts of the same DH. The opposite was observed when protein concentrations ranged from 0. 050 % to 0. 150 % (wprot/v).

5000|$|Sucrose {{is another}} {{ingredient}} utilized in most aerated confections. It is a disaccharide {{that consists of}} one glucose and fructose molecule. This sugar provides sweetness and bulk to the marshmallow, while simultaneously setting the foam to a firm consistency as it cools. [...] Sucrose, and sugars in general, impair {{the ability of a}} foam to form, but improve <b>foam</b> <b>stability.</b> Therefore, sucrose is used in conjunction with a protein like gelatin. The protein can adsorb, unfold, and form a stable network, while the sugar can increase the viscosity. Liquid drainage of the continuous phase must be minimized as well. Thick liquids drain more slowly than thin ones, and so increasing the viscosity of the continuous phase will reduce drainage. A high viscosity is essential if a stable foam is to be produced. Therefore, sucrose is a main component of marshmallow. But sucrose is seldom used on its own, because of its tendency to crystallize.|$|E
40|$|One of the {{pioneering}} applications of foam is in enhanced oil recovery (EOR).

30|$|Foamability and <b>foam</b> <b>stability</b> are two {{important}} properties of foam that determine its propagation during foam-based EOR. Foamability {{is defined as}} the capability of the surfactants to form foam, and <b>foam</b> <b>stability</b> is described by the variations of foam height or volume with time, following foam generation (Belhaij and Al-Mahdy 2015). In <b>foam</b> <b>stability</b> test, surfactants were tested for their ability to form stable foam and to provide suitable concentration for preparation of formulation. In this work, the foamability and <b>foam</b> <b>stability</b> of different surfactants and their mixtures were studied to screen chemical formulations for core flood studies.|$|E
30|$|Therefore, {{it can be}} {{inferred}} {{that the use of}} bulk <b>foam</b> <b>stability</b> tests should be restricted to screening out significantly lower performers.

40|$|The <b>foam</b> <b>stability</b> of protein–surfactant {{mixtures}} strongly {{depends on}} the charge of the protein and the surfactant, {{as well as on}} their mixing ratio. Depending on the conditions, the mixtures will contain free proteins, free surfactants and/or protein–surfactant complexes. To be able to compare different protein–surfactant mixtures, generic knowledge about the occurrence of each of these states and their relative contribution to <b>foam</b> <b>stability</b> is essential. In this work, the <b>foam</b> <b>stability</b> and interfacial properties of bovine serum albumin (BSA) mixed with sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) as well the binding of SDS to BSA as are studied at different molar ratios (MR). A comparison is made with ß-lactoglobulin (BLG) mixed with SDS. Both proteins and SDS are negatively charged at pH 7. The <b>foam</b> <b>stability</b> in the presence of small amounts (up to MR 1) of SDS is half the value of the pure protein solutions. The <b>foam</b> <b>stability</b> for both protein surfactant mixtures reaches a minimum at MR 20. A further increase of the MR leads to an increase of <b>foam</b> <b>stability.</b> The <b>foam</b> <b>stability</b> of BLG–SDS at MR > 20 follows the <b>foam</b> <b>stability</b> of pure SDS solutions at equivalent concentrations, while BSA–SDS mixtures have an offset and begin to increase from MR > 50. This behaviour was also reflected in the surface pressure and complex dilatational elastic moduli, and could be linked to the binding of the surfactant to the proteins. Both proteins bind SDS at high and low affinity binding sites. BSA's high affinity binding sites have a binding stoichiometry of 5. 5 molSDS/molprotein, and BLG's high affinity binding site has a stoichiometry of 0. 8 molSDS/molprotein (determined by isothermal titration calorimetry). Binding to the low affinity binding sites, occurs with a binding ratio, leading to an accumulation of free surfactants.

They observed that the <b>foam</b> <b>stability</b> and strength were similar in both bulk <b>foam</b> <b>stability</b> tests and coreflood stability tests in oil-free conditions. Also, Jones et al.

Because of this inherent difference, a new and more comprehensive approach will be used in comparing the two methods.
