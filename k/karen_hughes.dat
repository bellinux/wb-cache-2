5|$|Fay Ripley (born 26 February 1966) is an English {{actress and}} recipe author. She is a {{graduate}} of the Guildhall School of Music and Drama (1990). Her first professional role was in the chorus of a pantomime version of Around the World in 80 Days. Ripley's early film and television appearances were limited, so she supplemented her earnings by working as a children's entertainer and by selling menswear door-to-door. After her scenes as a prostitute were cut from Frankenstein (1994), Ripley gained her first major film role playing <b>Karen</b> <b>Hughes</b> in Mute Witness (1995).|$|E

He released an album under his own name in 1971 and two more in the early 1990s, and played with musicians such as JoAnne Brackeen, Joe Henderson, Takehiro Honda, Nobuyoshi Ino, <b>Karen</b> Mantler, <b>Hugh</b> Masekela, John Scofield, Jean-Luc Ponty, Sonny Rollins, and Shungo Sawada.|$|R
5|$|Ripley's early {{television}} and film career was characterised by minor roles as prostitutes or mistresses; {{in what was}} to be her film debut, she filmed two scenes as a prostitute in the film Frankenstein (Kenneth Branagh, 1994). In the first scene, her character was strangled by the creature (played by Robert De Niro's stand-in). The second scene featured De Niro himself, though Ripley's character was lying dead in a mortuary throughout. Pleased with what looked like her breakout role, Ripley bought a dress for the premiere, though she was distraught when Branagh sent her a card apologising for cutting her scenes from the finished film. The same year, she filmed the role of <b>Karen</b> <b>Hughes,</b> the sister of a mute character who believes she sees a murder, in the low-budget film Mute Witness (Anthony Waller, 1995). After Mute Witnesss British television premiere in 1999, a Daily Record critic wrote that Ripley's dramatic scenes were not as good as her comic ones.|$|E
5|$|Rolf Singer's fourth edition (1986) of his {{comprehensive}} Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy included Collybia racemosa {{in section}} Collybia, {{in addition to}} the three species that currently comprise the genus Collybia: C.tuberosa, C.cirrhata and C.cookei. A phylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer sequences of ribosomal DNA by <b>Karen</b> <b>Hughes</b> and colleagues showed that C.tuberosa, C.cirrhata and C.cookei form a monophyletic group within a larger Lyophyllum–Tricholoma–Collybia clade that includes several species of Lyophyllum, Tricholoma, Lepista, Hypsizygus and the species C.racemosa. Hughes and colleagues could not identify a clade that included all four species of Collybia. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the ribosomal DNA from the four species corroborated the results obtained from phylogenetic analysis. Based on these results, as well as differences in characteristics such as the presence of unique stem projections, fruit body pigmentation, and macrochemical reactions, they circumscribed the new genus Dendrocollybia to contain C.racemosa.|$|E

500|$|On August 13, 2007, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice {{announced}} that Ripken {{had been named}} Special Sports Envoy for the US State Department {{and that he would}} be going to China in October: [...] "...we're just delighted that somebody of Cal Ripken's stature is going to be someone who will go out and represent America so well and represent what we consider to be American values, but universal values; that hard work and diligence and the willingness to really put it all on the line every day is something that kids need to learn", said Rice. [...] "A Shortstop in China" [...] premiered on the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network on May 8, 2009, chronicling Ripken's trip to China to share the game of baseball with youth and coaches while nurturing American-Chinese diplomacy. The documentary included footage from the 11 clinics Cal and former Oriole B.J. Surhoff held from Beijing to Guangzhou. The documentary also showed Ripken accepting his appointment from Rice and featured a variety of interviews, from Ripken's wife Kelly to former Undersecretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs, <b>Karen</b> <b>Hughes.</b>|$|E

40|$|Context: Postprandial {{hyperglycemia}} is {{an important}} clinical problem in cystic fibrosis (CF), but the contribution of fat malabsorption, rapid gastric emptying, and the incretin axis has not been widely considered. Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate these aspects of gut function in nondiabetic CF patients. Design and Setting: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study at a clinical research laboratory. Patients: Five nondiabetic CF patients (three males; age, 25. 8 ± 1. 0 yr; body mass index, 20. 2 ± 1. 1 kg/m 2) with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and six healthy subjects of similar age and body mass index participated in the study. Interventions: CF patients consumed a radiolabeled mashed potato meal on 2 separate days, together with four capsules of Creon Forte (100, 000 IU lipase) or placebo. Healthy subjects consumed the meal once, without pancreatic enzymes. Main Outcome Measures: Gastric emptying was measured using scintigraphy, and blood was sampled frequently for blood glucose and plasma glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1), glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), and glucagon concentrations. Results: CF patients had more rapid gastric emptying (P < 0. 001), impaired secretion of GLP- 1 (P < 0. 01) and GIP (P < 0. 001), and greater postprandial glycemic excursions (P < 0. 001) than healthy subjects. Pancreatic enzyme supplementation normalized gastric emptying and GLP- 1 secretion and tended to increase glucagon (P = 0. 08), but did not completely restore GIP secretion or normalize postprandial blood glucose. There was an excellent correlation between gastric emptying and blood glucose concentration at 60 min (R = 0. 75; P = 0. 01). Conclusions: Pancreatic enzyme supplementation plays an important role in incretin secretion, gastric emptying, and postprandial hyperglycemia in CF. Paul Kuo, Julie E.

5000|$|The period {{beginning}} in the mid-1960s, {{with the passing of}} Civil Rights legislation and its repercussions, came the rise of an [...] "agenda" [...] theater comparable to that of the 1930s. Many of the major playwrights from the mid-century continued to produce new works, but were joined by names like Sam Shepard, Neil Simon, Romulus Linney, David Rabe, Lanford Wilson, David Mamet, and John Guare. Many important dramatists were women, including Beth Henley, Marsha Norman, Wendy Wasserstein, Megan Terry, Paula Vogel and María Irene Fornés. The growth of ethnic pride movements led to more success by dramatists from racial minorities, such as black playwrights Douglas Turner Ward, Adrienne Kennedy, Ed Bullins, Charles Fuller, Suzan-Lori Parks, Ntozake Shange, George C. Wolfe and August Wilson, who created a dramatic history of United States with his cycle of plays, The Pittsburgh Cycle, one for each decade of the 20th century. Asian-American theater is represented in the early 1970s by Frank Chin and achieved international success with David Henry Hwang's M. Butterfly. Latino theater grew from the local activist performances of Luis Valdez's Chicano-focused Teatro Campesino to his more formal plays, such as Zoot Suit, and later to the award-winning work of Cuban Americans Fornés (multiple Obies) and her student Nilo Cruz (Pulitzer), to Puerto Rican playwrights José Rivera and Miguel Piñero, and to the Tony Award-winning musical about Dominicans in New York City, In the Heights. Finally, the rise of the gay rights movement and of the AIDS crisis led to a number of important gay and lesbian dramatists, including Christopher Durang, Holly <b>Hughes,</b> <b>Karen</b> Malpede, Terrence McNally, Larry Kramer, Tony Kushner, whose Angels in America won the Tony Award two years in a row, and composer-playwright Jonathan Larson, whose musical Rent ran for over twelve years.|$|R
5000|$|In 1994 Athey {{became a}} figure in a culture war, as {{conservative}} politicians fought to bar artwork with visible gay and feminist content from receiving public funding. Controversy regarding {{the nature of his}} work was part of a series of battles regarding work by especially gay artists—such as a lawsuit filed by the NEA Four (<b>Karen</b> Finley, Holly <b>Hughes,</b> Tim Miller and John Fleck), and legal battles around the exhibition of work of Robert Mapplethorpe, David Wojnarowicz, Andres Serrano and Joel-Peter Witkin. Excerpts from Four Scenes in a Harsh Life were staged at Patrick's Cabaret in Minneapolis on March 5, 1994, with support from the Walker Art Center. The Walker's Performing Arts Director, John Killacky remembers that [...] "the sold-out performance was well received by an audience of about one hundred. Post-show discussions with the artist, attended by 80 people, were thoughtful and engaging. Theatre and dance critics had been invited, none chose to attend." [...] During one scene in this performance, Athey made light cuts in co-performer Darryl Carlton's (stage name Divinity Fudge) back, placed strips of absorbent paper towel on the cuts and then, using a pulley, hoisted the blood-stained cloths into the air. Local art critic/reporter Mary Abbe (who had not witnessed the performance) wrote a news account of complaints concerning the performance; this story appeared {{on the front page of}} the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. The report quoted the Walker's director Kathy Halbreich and performing arts director John Killacky, audience members, and Minnesota state health officials. The supervisor of the AIDS epidemiology unit in Minnesota's state health department said that [...] "it did not appear that audience members were endangered." [...] That story was picked up by the Associated Press and quickly made national headlines. The then-widespread anxiety about AIDS combined with a shocked reaction from those unfamiliar with S&M-related art: some critics and lawmakers, including Jesse Helms, falsely described his performances as exposing audience members to HIV-infected blood.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Karen</b> <b>Hughes,</b> {{a former}} adviser to George W.

[...] Brad Bannon of US News and World Report wrote, [...] "The [...] insults may also have an ironic backlash. Ryan, Akin, Mourdock, and Koster are poster boys for the need for more women in Congress, so Republican attacks on women may mean the election of more women." [...] The conservative blog Hot Air linked Akin's remarks to a ten percent shift in US public opinion polls toward supporting legalizing abortion in all circumstances. In a column in Salon, Joan Walsh wrote, [...] "suddenly Americans had to try to imagine how doctors or hospital administrators or law enforcement officials would decide what was 'legitimate rape,' as opposed to something else.

[...] In the interview which was set to play in the Middle East and South Asia, Ellison stressed global inclusiveness and quoted verse 49:13 of the Qur'an [...] "Oh humanity, We created you from a single pair..." [...] Ellison also accepted the Bush administration's request {{to be part of a}} [...] "teleconference with <b>Karen</b> <b>Hughes,</b> the State Department's undersecretary for public diplomacy.
