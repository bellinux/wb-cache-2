5|$|The film is Cooper's {{feature film}} debut. Costa's {{confident}} nature and backstory of being unwillingly {{moved to the}} film's setting of North Pasadena from Queens, New York was developed based on Cooper's auditions, where it was felt he <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> being from New York City, despite originating from Ohio.|$|E
5|$|By {{incorporating}} R infused beats in {{the music}} and not including her image on the cover artwork, marketing for the song <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> Madonna as a black artist. That impression {{did not last long}} as Madonna would later convince Sire executives to shoot a music video for the song. The low-budget video directed by Ed Steinberg showed Madonna and her friends in a club singing and dancing to the song. The video helped to further promote the song and Madonna as an artist.|$|E
5|$|Her friendships {{were limited}} to her ladies-in-waiting, and in {{particular}} Dona Josefina da Fonseca Costa. She was well liked by her attendants, a good judge {{of the character of}} visitors and courtiers, unpretentious, generous, kindly and an affectionate mother and grandmother. She dressed and acted modestly, only wearing jewelry for occasions of state, and <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> being somewhat sad. She had no interest in politics and occupied her time writing letters, reading, doing needlework, and attending to religious obligations and charitable projects. She possessed a beautiful voice, and often practiced her singing skills. Her appreciation for music also meant that she enjoyed opera and balls.|$|E

5|$|Mentmore Towers {{was chosen}} from twenty {{different}} locations for Wayne Manor, as Nolan and Crowley liked its white floors, which <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> the manor {{as a memorial}} to Wayne's parents. The building chosen to represent Arkham Asylum was the National Institute for Medical Research building in Mill Hill, northwest London, England. The St Pancras railway station and the Abbey Mills Pumping Stations were used for Arkham's interiors. University College London was used for courtrooms. Some scenes, including the Tumbler pursuit, were filmed in Chicago at locations such as Lower Wacker Drive and 35 East Wacker. Authorities agreed to raise Franklin Street Bridge for a scene where access to the Narrows is closed.|$|E
25|$|Lieutenant Colonel William Harold Dunn (1898–1955) wrote {{a medical}} and {{psychiatric}} report {{on him in}} prison to evaluate him as a suicide risk: He <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> clinging to his own theories in a fanatical and unyielding fashion and to have been little influenced by the unfolding during {{the trial of the}} cruelty and crimes of the party.|$|E

On 3 December he was transferred from Chita to Gyumri, and served in a tank battalion. According to his colleagues, he <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> a normal person and had no problems with the service.|$|E

25|$|Visually the car {{was quite}} different. The {{bodywork}} was now rectangular in cross section and spanned the full width over the wheels. Although actually higher, this increased width <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> a much lower and sleeker car, accentuated by the long stabilising tailfin and the purposeful raised ridges over the engine camboxes. This Blue Bird was clearly a design of the Modernist '30s, not the brute heroism of the '20s.|$|E
25|$|A Steadicam rig was {{employed}} {{during the filming}} of Return of the Jedi, in conjunction with two gyroscopes for extra stabilization, to film the background plates for the speeder bike chase. Steadicam inventor Garrett Brown operated the shot, walking through a redwood forest, running the camera at one frame per second. When projected at 24 frames per second, it <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> {{flying through the air}} at perilous speeds.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, lesser scandals {{tarnished}} Local Government Minister Kerry Hickey, and candidates Phil Koperberg and Aaron Beasley. This, {{coupled with an}} announcement by Attorney-General Bob Debus {{that he would be}} leaving state politics, <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> a Labor government in disarray. The following month, backbencher Steven Chaytor revealed that he had been charged with assaulting his girlfriend. An Independent Commission Against Corruption investigation was launched into MPs Cherie Burton and John Aquilina after a Burton staffer was found to have embezzled government funds.|$|E

25|$|Moore {{returned}} to the UK in 1968, and took up an appointment in London as Chairman of Dean Witter (International). The Moores set up residence in the suburb of Wimbledon where their three children (one daughter and two sons) were born. Moore became active in local Conservative politics and was elected {{to serve as a}} Councillor in the London Borough of Merton in 1971. He initially <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> being a liberal conservative. For example, he opposed the withdrawal of free school milk from the Borough's children which was happening {{as the result of the}} policy of Margaret Thatcher, then Secretary of State for Education.|$|E
25|$|The Luftwaffe's {{general picture}} of the VVS was entirely correct in many aspects in the {{military}} field; this was later confirmed {{in the early stages}} of Barbarossa and in post-war British and American studies, and also in the Eastern Bloc. Soviet sources confirm that the VVS was in a state of reorganisation before the attack, and were retraining on modern machines which made it unready for a major conflict. The deductions about Soviet tactical-operational limitations were to a large degree, accurate. In aircraft types, equipment and training, ground organisation, supply system at the operational level, the dispersal of effort and the operational commands immobility, <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> an air force with limited striking power.|$|E
25|$|Though {{government}} had {{been dominated by}} the Conservative Party {{for more than a}} decade, the new century saw much favourable legislation enacted in Ireland's interest. An electoral swing to the Liberal Party in the 1906 general election renewed Redmond's opportunities for working with government policy. The Liberals, however, did not yet back his party's demands for full Home Rule, which contributed to a renewal of agrarian radicalism in the ranch wars of 1906–1910. Redmond's low-key and conciliatory style of leadership <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> weakness but reflected the problem of keeping together a factionalised party. He grew in stature after 1906 and especially after 1910. As far as Redmond was concerned, the Home Rule movement was interested in promoting Irish nationality within the British Empire, {{but it was also a}} movement with a visceral antipathy to the English and their colonies.|$|E

25|$|On {{the morning}} of 26 August, while the BEF II Corps was engaged at the Battle of Le Cateau, Sir John French had a hostile meeting with Joffre and Lanrezac at Saint-Quentin. Lanrezac was only reluctantly persuaded by {{his chief of staff}} to attend, and before Joffre’s arrival he was {{observed}} loudly criticising both GQG and the BEF, making a poor impression on the junior officer who witnessed it. Lanrezac had his pince nez hanging from his ear “like a pair of cherries” and <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> being bored whilst Joffre was speaking. However, he assured Joffre that Fifth Army would be ready to counterattack {{as soon as he was}} out into open country where he could use his artillery. French complained of Lanrezac’s behaviour, to which Lanrezac shrugged and gave a vague and academic reply. Joffre stayed for lunch (Lanrezac declined to do so), at which the atmosphere improved, as Joffre confessed that he too was dissatisfied with Lanrezac.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Saret Koheh {{made good}} on the threats of the “Night Letter” posted in Kamdesh {{beginning}} the campaign season of 2007. It also confronted Lieutenant Colonel Kolenda commanding American forces {{in the area in}} Naray, with the fact that COIN operations in Nuristan were facing a crisis. AAF operations in the area were expanding, involving a greater proportion of the local population, and were being supported by Taliban organizations in Pakistan. American forces were strung out in a thinly held and poorly supplied picket line from Naray to Kamdesh along the Landay-Sin River. The American forces were too outnumbered to survive in sustained combat with the local population. Something had to be done to put the Americans and the Afghans of Nuristan on the same side. The first effort in a new COIN campaign was made by First Lieutenant Dave Roller. He decided that the appearance of American soldiers in their “battle rattle” war gear <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> soulless killing machines. Encased in armor, helmets, and weapons, Americans appeared to be looking for a fight. As a contrast Dave attended his next meeting with the Kamdesh village leaders dressed in a T-shirt and shorts. When he spoke to them he discussed their common values as leaders of families and communities working toward a better future for their children. Mawlawi Abdul Rahman of Kamdesh was a local elder much impressed with this new approach. He began building a consensus of village elders in support of the Afghan government. Through {{the rest of the summer}} and fall of 2008, Captain Joey Hutto, the new commander of COP Keating, and his troops expanded this initiative. Hutto had worked for years on COIN campaigns in Central America, and put his skills to good use in Nuristan.|$|E

500|$|Phoebe Hearst {{also built}} other {{structures}} including The Gables—a storybook dwelling for overflow guests—and a [...] "Honeymoon Cottage". The castle was habitable in 1902, completely finished in 1904. It {{was featured in}} American Homes and Gardens in 1906, a three-page spread; the same space given the house in Architectural Review in 1904. The writer in Architectural Review criticized the quaint wooden carvings which <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> [...] "pastry and perfume", but praised the most {{important aspects of the}} structure: ...|$|E
500|$|Getty was a private, {{reserved}} person, which, {{combined with}} his tendency to delegate to ministers, sometimes <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> an uncaring aloofness. [...] During the Principal Group affair, which he left {{primarily in the}} hands of Treasurer Dick Johnston and Consumer and Corporate Affairs Minister Elaine McCoy, a photographer captured a shot of Getty playing golf while his press secretary had said that he was [...] "working out of the office". [...] This was typical of his strained relationship with the media, which Adair attributed to the Premier's awkwardness and the media's unfairness.|$|E
500|$|Providence Hall, a {{red brick}} {{building}} with a tower, housed classrooms, the college library, and the refectory. [...] It was built in 1832. [...] The name was suggested by Moses Allen, who was President of the Board and the son-in-law John McMillan, the college's founder. [...] It had three floors plus a basement, but a peak on the roof <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> a fifth floor. [...] From 1832 to 1890 it was a meeting place for Presbyterian Church of Canonsburg. [...] In 1966, it was razed to build a junior high school.|$|E
