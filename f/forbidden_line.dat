In 1864 William Huggins noticed that many nebulae showed only emission lines rather than a full spectrum like stars. From the work of Kirchhoff, he concluded that nebulae must contain [...] "enormous masses of luminous gas or vapour." [...] However, there were several emission lines that could not be linked to any terrestrial element, brightest among them lines at 495.9nm and 500.7nm. These lines were attributed to a new element, nebulium, until Ira Bowen determined in 1927 that the emission lines were from highly ionised oxygen (O+2). These emission lines could not be replicated in a laboratory because they are forbidden lines; the low density of a nebula (one atom per cubic centimetre) allows for metastable ions to decay via <b>forbidden</b> <b>line</b> emission rather than collisions with other atoms.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} late-time (t > 200 days after peak brightness) spectra of Type Iax supernovae (SNe Iax), a low-luminosity, {{low-energy}} class of thermonuclear stellar explosions observationally similar to, but distinct from, Type Ia supernovae. We present new spectra of SN 2014 dt, {{resulting in the}} most complete published late-time spectral sequence of a SN Iax. At late times, SNe Iax have generally similar spectra, all with a similar continuum shape and strong forbidden-line emission. However, there is also significant diversity where some late-time SN Iax spectra display narrow P-Cygni features and a continuum indicative of a photosphere in addition to strong narrow <b>forbidden</b> <b>lines,</b> while others have no obvious P-Cygni features, strong broad <b>forbidden</b> <b>lines,</b> and weak narrow <b>forbidden</b> <b>lines.</b> Finally, some SNe Iax have spectra intermediate to these two varieties with weak P-Cygni features and broad/narrow <b>forbidden</b> <b>lines</b> of similar strength. We find that SNe Iax with strong broad <b>forbidden</b> <b>lines</b> {{also tend to be}} more luminous and have higher-velocity ejecta at peak brightness. We estimate blackbody and kinematic radii of the late-time photosphere, finding the latter an order of magnitude larger than the former. We propose a two-component model that solves this discrepancy and explains the diversity of the late-time spectra of SNe Iax. In this model, the broad <b>forbidden</b> <b>lines</b> originate from the SN ejecta, while the photosphere, P-Cygni <b>lines,</b> and narrow <b>forbidden</b> <b>lines</b> originate from a wind launched from the remnant of the progenitor white dwarf and is driven by the radioactive decay of newly synthesized material left in the remnant. The relative strength of the two components accounts for the diversity of late-time SN Iax spectra. This model also solves the puzzle of a long-lived photosphere and slow late-time decline of SNe Iax.

50|$|In spectroscopy, a {{forbidden}} mechanism (forbidden transition or <b>forbidden</b> <b>line)</b> is a {{spectral line}} associated with absorption or emission of light by atomic nuclei, atoms, or molecules which undergo a transition {{that is not}} allowed by a particular selection rule but is allowed if the approximation associated with that rule is not made. For example, in a situation where, according to usual approximations (such as the electric-dipole approximation for the interaction with light), the process cannot happen, but {{at a higher level}} of approximation (e.g. magnetic dipole, or, electric quadrupole) the process is allowed but at a much lower rate.|$|E

Nor did they appear to be stars that had evolved off the main sequence into giant or supergiant stars. It is now thought that they are main sequence stars that have absorbed or are absorbing matter, most likely from a companion star, and are surrounded by a compact dusty shell. These stars are thought to be significant contributors to interstellar dust.|$|E

5000|$|Forbidden {{emission}} {{lines have}} been observed in extremely low-density gases and plasmas, either in outer space or in the extreme upper atmosphere of the Earth. In space environments, densities may be only a few atoms per cubic centimetre, making atomic collisions unlikely. Under such conditions, once an atom or molecule has been excited for any reason into a meta-stable state, then it {{is almost certain to}} decay by emitting a forbidden-line photon. Since meta-stable states are rather common, forbidden transitions account for a significant percentage of the photons emitted by the ultra-low density gas in space. Forbidden transitions in highly charged ions resulting in the emission of visible, vacuum-ultraviolet, soft x-ray and x-ray photons are routinely observed in certain laboratory devices such as electron beam ion traps [...] and ion storage rings, where in both cases residual gas densities are sufficiently low for <b>forbidden</b> <b>line</b> emission to occur before atoms are collisionally de-excited.

In this study we observe UV resonance line absorption in the central stars of PNe produced by the nebular gas, and from the same ions that emit optical <b>forbidden</b> <b>lines.</b> We then compare the derived absorption column densities with the emission measures determined from ground-based observations of the nebular <b>forbidden</b> <b>lines.</b> We find for our sample of PNe that the collisionally excited <b>forbidden</b> <b>lines</b> yield column densities that are in basic agreement with the column densities derived for the same ions from the UV absorption lines.

An additional sample of objects with larger abundance discrepancy factors will need to be studied before a stronger statement can be made that recombination line abundances are not correct.

Using the analytic model of Shu and coworkers and Hollenbach and coworkers as a basis, we examine the characteristics of photoevaporative outflows with hydrodynamic simulations. General results from the simulations agree well with the analytic predictions, although some small differences are present. Most importantly, the flow of material from the disk surface develops at smaller radii than in the analytic approximations, and the flow velocity from the disk surface is only one-third the sound speed. A detailed presentation of observational consequences of the model is given, including predicted line widths, blueshifts, and integrated luminosities of observable sulfur and nitrogen emission lines.

40|$|The first {{observation}} of the Ne III 36. 02 micron <b>forbidden</b> <b>line</b> in a planetary nebula, NGC 6543, is presented. Since the dominant form of neon in medium-excitation to high-excitation planetary nebulae is Ne III, the abundance of this ion is important in determining the total neon abundance.

However, current atomic parameters lead to a Ne III abundance in NGC 6543 which is 4. 5 times the cosmic neon abundance and 2. 6 times the abundance from optical line studies. Although such a high abundance cannot be ruled out immediately, inaccuracies in the infrared level collision strengths are suspected because resonances were neglected in their calculation. The 36 micron line is also useful as a temperature probe when combined with the Ne III 3868 -A <b>forbidden</b> <b>line.</b> When compared to Ne III 15. 56 micron <b>forbidden</b> <b>line</b> fluxes, a temperature-insensitive density estimate may be obtained.
