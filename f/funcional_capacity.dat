The project is divided into drawings and written part including the <b>funcional</b> <b>capacity</b> calculation and electromotor output. Further the part includes proposal of key dimensions of the conveyer with the soilidity control of the worm, solving of the suspended bearings, assemble issues, maintenance and potencial exchange of the worm due to abrasion...|$|E
40|$|The {{aging process}} is {{characterized}} by the loss of functional capacities and difficult to carry out the daily activities. This loss is, in general, consequence of low muscle use. Because of this, our aim in the presente study was to verify the effects of adapted capoeira practiced by 60 years and older women on anthropometrics parameters and <b>funcional</b> <b>capacities.</b> Twelve women voluntaries aging 70. 8 ï‚± 6. 0 year were evaluated on body weight, height, body mass index (BMI), skin fold thickness and functional capacities as flexibility, strengh, resistance, agility and equilibrium. So, they were subbmited to training with adapted capoeira 60 min/day, twice a week, during 12 weeks and evaluated again. Differences between weight, height and BMI before and after training were not significative (p> 0. 05). Agility improved 9. 3 % (p< 0. 05), resistance increased 33. 8 %, flexibility increased 68. 1 % and equilibrium increased 83. 5 % (p< 0. 001). We concluded that, besides anthropometric measures had not shown differences, there was improvement on four of functional capacities, showing that adapted capoeira can help the elderly people to maintain their independence...|$|R
