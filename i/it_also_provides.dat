5|$|An {{alternative}} is to test respondents at the researcher's facility with opening statements or a full-blown mock trial instead of reading a case summary over the telephone. The higher cost of a mock trial allows for a more realistic portrayal of the real trial and (researchers hope) more accurate data. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>provides</b> a better opportunity to question the subjects, {{before and after the}} trial simulation. On the other hand, telephone surveys provide a larger and more representative sample of the jury pool. Diamond indicates that since both methods have advantages, SJS practitioners commonly rely on both in the same case.|$|E

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>provides</b> a {{powerful}} toolkit for studying strongly coupled quantum field theories. Much of {{the usefulness of}} the duality results {{from the fact that it}} is a strong-weak duality: when the fields of the quantum field theory are strongly interacting, the ones in the gravitational theory are weakly interacting and thus more mathematically tractable. This fact has been used to study many aspects of nuclear and condensed matter physics by translating problems in those subjects into more mathematically tractable problems in string theory.|$|E

5|$|When he {{developed}} his scheme for organizing {{all of his}} novels and stories into a single sequence called La Comédie humaine, Balzac placed La Peau de chagrin {{at the start of}} the section called Études philosophiques ("Philosophical Studies").

But <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>provides</b> a bridge to the realism of the Études des mœurs ("Study of Manners"), where the majority of his novels were located.|$|E
5|$|Last Exile {{is set on}} {{the fictional}} world of Prester. Prester's two nations of Anatoray and Disith are {{separated}} by a turbulent region of the sky known as the Grand Stream and are engaged in eternal conflict according to the code of chivalric warfare. A superior faction known as the Guild enforces these rules. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>provides</b> the two nations with technology but, unknown to them, has dishonorable intentions, to preserve {{the status quo and}} enforce its dominance of both sides. Although the story is set in the future, the technology employed differs from that in a typical space opera. Instead, the show's retro-futuristic dieselpunk setting resembles nineteenth-century Europe {{at the height of the}} Industrial Revolution. Inhabitants of Prester operate aerial vehicles known as vanships in the world's Golden Age of Aviation; although the technology is primitive, the aerial vehicles use a form of antigravity (developed by the Guild) and lighter-than-air methods of flight rather than the use of wings.|$|E
