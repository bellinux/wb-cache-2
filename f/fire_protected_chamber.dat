40|$|A {{numerical}} {{method is}} presented to determine the thermal conductivity of homogeneous insulation material using boundary temperature measurements. In this inverse analysis the direct problem consists of non-linear partial differential equation that is semidiscretized vla the variational form of the heat conduction problem. The inverse problem is reduced to minimization of a regularized functional of residuals solved by numerical gradient methods. Tikhonov and mesh coarsing regularizations are used. This method {{is known as the}} Regularized Output Least Squares Method (RLS). The accuracy of the predicted results is examined from an illustrated 1 -D case of a <b>fire</b> <b>protected</b> steel plate. Transient test temperature of the steel plate is simulated. Noise of randomly varying amplitude is added to the simulated temperature. Results show that good estimations on the thermal conductivity can be obtained without measuring temperature inside the insulation material.

An experimental fire simulation results in railway tunnel indicate that the temperature distribution of laminar flame, the smoke concentration and flow velocity can be expressed by the fully developed smoke flow downwind. Through numerical simulation, it is concluded that the turbulent flow field models are better and have good consistency with the experimental results. The phenomenon of tunnel fire, the development and distribution of smoke flow can not only provide great support on the <b>fire</b> <b>protecting</b> and ventilation plan, but also give better reference to the pedestrian evacuation and the design of disaster prevention and mitigation...|$|R

The testing reported in this paper suggests that it is not necessary to apply fire protection to each side of a penetrating steel member since the resulting temperature rise of the member is insufficient to cause ignition...|$|R
