5|$|Silicon tombac: <b>high-strength</b> alloy made of copper, zinc and silicon. Often {{used as an}} {{alternative}} for investment casted steel parts.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>high-strength</b> steel alloys (for example, 41xx steels) contain 0.25% to 8% {{molybdenum}}. Even {{in these}} small portions, more than 43,000 tonnes of molybdenum are used {{each year in}} stainless steels, tool steels, cast irons, and high-temperature superalloys.|$|E
5|$|Boron fibers (boron filaments) are <b>high-strength,</b> {{lightweight}} {{materials that are}} used chiefly for advanced aerospace structures {{as a component of}} composite materials, as well as limited production consumer and sporting goods such as golf clubs and fishing rods. The fibers can be produced by chemical vapor deposition of boron on a tungsten filament.|$|E
5|$|Cadmium electroplating, {{consuming}} 6% of {{the global}} production, {{is used in the}} aircraft industry to reduce corrosion of steel components. This coating is passivated by chromate salts. A limitation of cadmium plating is hydrogen embrittlement of <b>high-strength</b> steels from the electroplating process. Therefore, steel parts heat-treated to tensile strength above 1300 MPa (200 ksi) should be coated by an alternative method (such as special low-embrittlement cadmium electroplating processes or physical vapor deposition).|$|E
5|$|Cobalt is {{primarily}} {{used in the}} preparation of magnetic, wear-resistant and <b>high-strength</b> alloys. The compounds, cobalt silicate and cobalt(II) aluminate (CoAl2O4, cobalt blue) give a distinctive deep blue color to glass, ceramics, inks, paints and varnishes. Cobalt occurs naturally as only one stable isotope, cobalt-59. Cobalt-60 is a commercially important radioisotope, used as a radioactive tracer and for the production of high energy gamma rays.|$|E
5|$|Uses {{for regular}} glass fiber include mats and fabrics for thermal insulation, {{electrical}} insulation, sound insulation, <b>high-strength</b> fabrics or heat- and corrosion-resistant fabrics. It {{is also used}} to reinforce various materials, such as tent poles, pole vault poles, arrows, bows and crossbows, translucent roofing panels, automobile bodies, hockey sticks, surfboards, boat hulls, and paper honeycomb. It has been used for medical purposes in casts. Glass fiber is extensively used for making FRP tanks and vessels.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from its}} use in {{fertilisers}} and energy-stores, nitrogen is a constituent of organic compounds as diverse as Kevlar used in <b>high-strength</b> fabric and cyanoacrylate used in superglue. Nitrogen is a constituent of every major pharmacological drug class, including antibiotics. Many drugs are mimics or prodrugs of natural nitrogen-containing signal molecules: for example, the organic nitrates nitroglycerin and nitroprusside control blood pressure by metabolizing into nitric oxide. Many notable nitrogen-containing drugs, such as the natural caffeine and morphine or the synthetic amphetamines, act on receptors of animal neurotransmitters.|$|E
5|$|Elemental boron is a {{metalloid}} that {{is found}} in small amounts in meteoroids but chemically uncombined boron is not otherwise found naturally on Earth. Industrially, very pure boron is produced with difficulty because of refractory contamination by carbon or other elements. Several allotropes of boron exist: amorphous boron is a brown powder; crystalline boron is silvery to black, extremely hard (about 9.5 on the Mohs scale), and a poor electrical conductor at room temperature. The primary use of elemental boron is as boron filaments with applications similar to carbon fibers in some <b>high-strength</b> materials.|$|E
5|$|Mild steel corrodes {{more readily}} than wrought iron, but is cheaper and more widely available. Carbon steel {{contains}} 2.0% carbon or less, with small amounts of manganese, sulfur, phosphorus, and silicon. Alloy steels contain varying amounts of carbon {{as well as other}} metals, such as chromium, vanadium, molybdenum, nickel, tungsten, etc. Their alloy content raises their cost, and so they are usually only employed for specialist uses. One common alloy steel, though, is stainless steel. Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed 'HSLA' or <b>high-strength,</b> low alloy steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost.|$|E
5|$|USS Theodore Roosevelt {{and later}} {{carriers}} have slight structural differences {{from the earlier}} Nimitz carriers such as improved protection for ordnance stored in their magazines. Other improvements include upgraded flight deck ballistic protection, first installed on USS George Washington, and the <b>high-strength</b> low-alloy steel (HSLA-100) used for constructing ships starting with USS John C. Stennis. More recently, older ships have had their flight decks upgraded with a new non-slip material fitted on new-build ships, to improve safety for both crew members and aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Boron is {{primarily}} used in chemical compounds. About {{half of all}} boron consumed globally is an additive in fiberglass for insulation and structural materials. The next leading use is in polymers and ceramics in <b>high-strength,</b> lightweight structural and refractory materials. Borosilicate glass is desired for its greater strength and thermal shock resistance than ordinary soda lime glass. Boron compounds are used as fertilizers in agriculture and in sodium perborate bleaches. A small amount of boron {{is used as a}} dopant in semiconductors, and reagent intermediates in the synthesis of organic fine chemicals. A few boron-containing organic pharmaceuticals are used or are in study. Natural boron is composed of two stable isotopes, one of which (boron-10) has a number of uses as a neutron-capturing agent.|$|E
5|$|Development of the I-212, {{one such}} variant, began in 1947 as a twin-engined, all-metal, two-seat jet fighter. The round, {{streamlined}} fuselage was optimized to reduce drag and house the {{considerable amount of}} equipment and fuel required by the VVS. It had mid-mounted straight laminar flow wings and the engine nacelles were mounted {{in the middle of}} the wing, with the wing spars continued by banjo rings around the engines. The cruciform tail unit was swept at 45°. To save weight, the main load-bearing structures of the airframe were constructed from V-95 aluminum alloy and <b>high-strength</b> steel. Elektron (a magnesium alloy) was used for many components and castings. The aircraft used a tricycle undercarriage with the main wheels retracting into the fuselage. Hydraulically actuated air brakes were fitted either side of the rear fuselage.|$|E
5|$|The F-22 {{is among}} {{only a few}} {{aircraft}} that can supercruise, or sustain supersonic flight without using fuel-inefficient afterburners; it can intercept targets which subsonic aircraft would lack the speed to pursue and an afterburner-dependent aircraft would lack the fuel to reach. The Raptor's high operating altitude is also a significant tactical advantage over prior fighters. The use of internal weapons bays permits the aircraft to maintain comparatively higher performance over most other combat-configured fighters {{due to a lack}} of aerodynamic drag from external stores. The F-22's structure contains a significant amount of <b>high-strength</b> materials to withstand stress and heat of sustained supersonic flight. Respectively, titanium alloys and composites comprise 39% and 24% of the aircraft's structural weight.|$|E
5|$|The {{contract}} {{for construction of}} the pontoon bridge was awarded in August 1991 to a consortium, Arbeidsfellesskapet Salhus Bru, which consisted of Norwegian Contractors, Aker Entreprenør, Veidekke and Kværner Eureka. The components were built in Moss and Fredrikstad and then shipped to Lonevågen, a branch of Osterfjorden which was suitable to connect the parts. There were problems welding the <b>high-strength</b> low-alloy steel, {{which resulted in the}} work being halted for several days before an agreement was reached between the contractor and the Public Roads Administration. On 26 January 1994, the steel frame which would be used to fasten the pontoon bridge to the cable-stayed bridge, came adrift during transport in Skagerrak, and was severely damaged, causing a delay in the project. As the bridge had the longest laterally unsupported span in the world, the construction was watched by many international delegations.|$|E
5|$|Sheffield has an {{international}} reputation for metallurgy and steel-making. Many innovations in these fields {{have been made}} in Sheffield, for example Benjamin Huntsman discovered the crucible technique in the 1740s at his workshop in Handsworth. This process was rendered obsolete in 1856 by Henry Bessemer's invention of the Bessemer converter. Thomas Boulsover invented Sheffield Plate (silver-plated copper) in the early 18thcentury. Stainless steel was invented by Harry Brearley in 1912, and the work of F. B. Pickering and T. Gladman throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s was fundamental to the development of modern <b>high-strength</b> low-alloy steels. Further innovations continue, with new advanced manufacturing technologies and techniques being developed on the Advanced Manufacturing Park by Sheffield's universities and other independent research organisations. Organisations located on the AMP include the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC, a research partnership between the Boeing Company and the University of Sheffield), Castings Technology International (CTI), The Welding Institute (TWI), and William Cook Group.|$|E

25|$|Skin {{exposure}} symptoms include: pain, redness, burns, blisters, and scarring of tissue. A serious skin {{exposure to}} <b>high-strength</b> phosphoric acid can even cause death.|$|E
25|$|Plywood {{is used in}} many {{applications}} that need high-quality, <b>high-strength</b> sheet material. Quality in this context means resistance to cracking, breaking, shrinkage, twisting and warping.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} Mercedes 190, the W124 {{was the first}} {{serially}} manufactured car in history to see widespread use of light-weight <b>high-strength</b> steels, which today are a standard in car design.|$|E
25|$|<b>High-strength</b> {{aluminium}} alloys have the tensile strength of medium strong steel alloys while providing significant weight advantages. Therefore, aluminium forged parts are mainly used in aerospace, automotive industry {{and many other}} fields of engineering especially in those fields, where highest safety standards against failure by abuse, by shock or vibratory stresses are needed. Such parts are for example chassis parts, steering components and brake parts. Commonly used alloys are AlSi1MgMn (EN AW-6082) and AlZnMgCu1,5 (EN AW-7075). About 80% of all aluminium forged parts are made of AlSi1MgMn. The <b>high-strength</b> alloy AlZnMgCu1,5 is mainly used for aerospace applications.|$|E
25|$|From {{the tower}} foundation, towers of single or {{multiple}} columns are erected using <b>high-strength</b> reinforced concrete, stonework, or steel. Concrete is used most frequently in modern suspension bridge construction {{due to the}} high cost of steel.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the huge}} cost of {{importing}} steel, the towers were constructed on a cheaper radical design of super <b>high-strength</b> reinforced concrete. <b>High-strength</b> concrete is a material familiar to Asian contractors and twice as effective as steel in sway reduction; however, it makes the building twice as heavy on its foundation as a comparable steel building. Supported by 23-by-23 metre concrete cores and an outer ring of widely spaced super columns, the towers use a sophisticated structural system that accommodates its slender profile and provides 560,000 square metres of column-free office space. Below the twin towers is Suria KLCC, a shopping mall, and Dewan Filharmonik Petronas, {{the home of the}} Malaysian Philharmonic Orchestra.|$|E
25|$|The Vektor R4 is a South African {{variant of}} the Galil ARM assault rifle with several modifications; notably, both the stock and {{magazine}} are made of a <b>high-strength</b> polymer and the stock was lengthened, adapting the weapon for the average South African soldier.|$|E
25|$|According to GM, the Cruze's body {{structure}} is 65percent <b>high-strength</b> steel. MacPherson struts are utilized {{in the front}} suspension with a solid torsion beam axle for the rear, avoiding the cost and complexity needed for a modern multi-link independent rear suspension used by some more expensive rivals.|$|E
25|$|The Hiduminium alloys or R.R. alloys are {{a series}} of <b>high-strength,</b> {{high-temperature}} aluminium alloys, developed for aircraft use by Rolls-Royce ("RR") before World War II. They were manufactured and later developed by High Duty Alloys Ltd.. The name Hi-Du-Minium is derived from that of High Duty Aluminium Alloys.|$|E
25|$|The Duralumin alloys {{had already}} {{demonstrated}} <b>high-strength</b> aluminium alloys. Y alloy's virtue was {{its ability to}} maintain high strength at high temperatures. R.R alloys were developed by Hall & Bradbury at Rolls-Royce, partly to simplify the manufacture of components using them. A deliberate heat treatment process of multiple steps was used to control their physical properties.|$|E
25|$|The {{design was}} {{finalised}} in early 1956. Metropolitan-Vickers {{was hired to}} build the machine, which included a 150tonne pulse transformer, the largest built in England to that point. A serious issue arose when the required <b>high-strength</b> steels needed for the electrical components were in short supply, but a strike in the US electrical industry caused a sudden glut of material, resolving the problem.|$|E
25|$|An aquarist owns fish or {{maintains}} an aquarium, typically constructed of glass or <b>high-strength</b> acrylic. Cuboid aquaria are {{also known as}} fish tanks or simply tanks, while bowl-shaped aquaria are also known as fish bowls. Size can range from a small glass bowl to immense public aquaria. Specialized equipment maintains appropriate water quality and other characteristics suitable for the aquarium's residents.|$|E
25|$|Compressed air {{energy storage}} {{can also be}} {{employed}} {{on a smaller scale}} such as exploited by air cars and air-driven locomotives, and can use <b>high-strength</b> carbon-fiber air storage tanks. In order to retain the energy stored in compressed air, this tank should be thermally isolated from the environment; else, the energy stored will escape under the form of heat since compressing air raises its temperature.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, the {{structure}} was repaired permanently using post-tensioning. The living room flagstone floor blocks were individually tagged and removed. Blocks were joined {{to the concrete}} cantilever beams and floor joists, <b>high-strength</b> steel cables were fed through the blocks and exterior concrete walls and tightened using jacks. The floors and walls were then restored, leaving Fallingwater’s interior and exterior appearance unchanged. The cantilevers now had sufficient support, and the deflection stopped.|$|E
25|$|Silicones {{are often}} used in {{waterproofing}} treatments, molding compounds, mold-release agents, mechanical seals, high temperature greases and waxes, and caulking compounds. Silicone is also sometimes used in breast implants, contact lenses, explosives and pyrotechnics. Silly Putty was originally made by adding boric acid to silicone oil. Other silicon compounds function as high-technology abrasives and new <b>high-strength</b> ceramics based upon silicon carbide. Silicon is a component of some superalloys.|$|E
25|$|Kevlar is the {{registered}} trademark for a para-aramid synthetic fiber, related to other aramids such as Nomex and Technora. Developed by Stephanie Kwolek at DuPont in 1965, this <b>high-strength</b> material was first commercially {{used in the}} early 1970s {{as a replacement for}} steel in racing tires. Typically it is spun into ropes or fabric sheets that can be used as such or as an ingredient in composite material components.|$|E
25|$|Salvage divers from Halliburton first {{detached}} the bow {{from the}} rest of the vessel because it may have contained unexploded torpedo warheads and because it could break off and destabilise the lifting. The divers installed two large hydraulic suction anchors into the seabed and attached a <b>high-strength</b> tungsten carbide abrasive saw that was pulled back and forth over the bow between the anchors. It took ten days to detach the bow.|$|E
25|$|In Oakland, California at the East Bay Municipal Utility District’s main {{wastewater}} treatment plant (EBMUD), food waste is currently codigested with primary and secondary municipal wastewater solids and other <b>high-strength</b> wastes. Compared to municipal wastewater solids digestion alone, food waste codigestion has many benefits. Anaerobic digestion of food waste pulp from the EBMUD food waste process provides a higher normalized energy benefit, compared to municipal wastewater solids: 730 to 1,300 kWh per dry ton of food waste applied compared to 560 to 940 kWh per dry ton of municipal wastewater solids applied.|$|E
