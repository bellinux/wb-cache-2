5|$|Four Mets' first-round picks {{have won}} {{championship}}s with the franchise. No first-round picks {{were on the}} 1969 championship team. Outfielders Lee Mazzilli (1973) and <b>Darryl</b> <b>Strawberry</b> (1980), shortstop Wally Backman (1977), and pitcher Dwight Gooden (1982) played in the 1986 World Series for the Mets' second championship team. Three first-round draft picks {{have gone on to}} win the Rookie of the Year Award with the Mets: Jon Matlack in 1972, Strawberry in 1983, and Gooden in 1984. Gooden {{went on to win the}} Cy Young Award in 1985, his second season, after placing second in the voting his rookie year.

5|$|In 1965, Rick Monday became MLB's {{first draft}} pick after being {{selected}} by the Kansas City Athletics. Royce Lewis is the most recent first overall pick; he was drafted by the Minnesota Twins in 2017. Overall, 23 of the 50 picks before 2015 {{have participated in the}} All-Star Game, and three (Bob Horner, <b>Darryl</b> <b>Strawberry,</b> and Bryce Harper) have won the Rookie of the Year Award. Twenty-five of the fifty picks before 2015 have been drafted from high schools, one has been drafted out of the Independent American Association, and the others were drafted from universities. To date, Arizona State University and Vanderbilt University are the only schools from which multiple number-one overall draft picks have been chosen. No first overall pick was inducted into the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame until 2016, when Ken Griffey, Jr. was inducted with a record 99.3% of votes cast.|$|E
5|$|The New York Mets {{concluded}} {{the regular season}} {{with a record of}} 100–60 while the Dodgers had a 94–67 record. The Mets had won ten of the eleven head-to-head regular season contests and were the favorite in the series. On October 4, 1988, Hershiser posted eight scoreless innings in Game 1 of the 1988 NL Championship Series (bringing his unofficial total of consecutive scoreless innings to 67) before surrendering runs in the 9th inning. In both the third and sixth inning the Mets got two runners on base only to have the third out recorded on infield grounders to Hershiser. In the ninth inning, Gregg Jefferies led off with a single on a sinker down the middle and reached second base on a ground out in a hit and run play with Keith Hernandez. Jefferies, a rookie, recorded his third hit in four at bats in his first ever appearance against Hershiser. With Jefferies on second, <b>Darryl</b> <b>Strawberry</b> posted an RBI double on a pitch he described as up in the strike zone. Strawberry had fouled off four fastballs before getting what Lasorda called a hanging curveball. After Hershiser gave up a run in the ninth inning 100 pitches into his performance, pitching coach Perranoski removed him from the game by signaling for a double switch before getting to the mound to talk to Hershiser. The Dodgers' bullpen had led the league in saves that year. Howell had recorded 18 consecutive scoreless innings in relief. Howell's scoreless streak was longer in calendar days, his last runs allowed occurring on August 11. It had been 35 days since anyone had scored a run against Hershiser. Controversially, Mets pitcher David Cone attributed Hershiser's success to luck after the Mets rallied to score against him in the ninth inning. The Mets went on to add two more runs on Gary Carter's shallow fly ball that center fielder John Shelby could not secure until it first hit the ground. The ball bounced out of his glove as he lunged for the catch, yielding the tying and winning runs. Despite the results, Hershiser's scoreless inning streak in the regular season was still intact at 59 consecutive innings, as the runs scored against him on October 4 were in the postseason.|$|E

50|$|While {{the team}} around the 1986 {{championship}} was strong, they also became infamous for off-the-field controversy. Both Strawberry and Gooden were youngsters who wound up burning out long before their {{time because of}} various substance abuse and personal problems. Hernandez's cocaine abuse {{was the subject of}} persistent rumors even before he joined the Mets, but he publicly acknowledged his addiction in 1985 and made a successful recovery. Lenny Dykstra's reputation was recently tainted by allegations of steroid use and gambling problems.Instead of putting together a winning dynasty, the problems caused the Mets to soon fall apart.Despite <b>Darryl</b> <b>Strawberry's</b> numerous off-the-field mishaps, he remains the Mets' all-time leader in home runs and runs batted in.|$|R

25|$|In 1986, Ryan's Astros {{faced the}} New York Mets in the National League Championship Series. Ryan had a shaky start in Game2, taking the loss. He {{returned}} in Game5, throwing 9 innings of 2-hit, 1-run, 12-strikeout ball, {{but one of}} those hits was a <b>Darryl</b> <b>Strawberry</b> home run which tied the game at 1–1, as Dwight Gooden matched Ryan pitch for pitch. Ryan got a no-decision as his Astros lost in 12 innings.|$|E

In 2004, Anderson starred in the Royal Court Theatre's production of Rebecca Gilman's play The Sweetest Swing in Baseball, as artist Dana Fielding who assumes the personality of the troubled baseball player <b>Darryl</b> <b>Strawberry</b> – a role for which she earned rave reviews.|$|E
50|$|The Yankees {{clinched}} the series with a six-run third off of Scott Erickson. Jim Leyritz led off the inning {{with a home}} run, then Derek Jeter and Wade Boggs hit consecutive one-out singles. Second baseman Roberto Alomar's error on Bernie Williams's ground ball let Jeter score and put runners on first and third. After Tino Martinez hit into a fielder's choice at home, Cecil Fielder's three-run home run put the Yankees up 5-0. <b>Darryl</b> <b>Strawberry's</b> home run then made it 6-0. Though Erickson and three relievers held the Yankees scoreless {{for the rest of}} the game, Andy Pettitte pitched 5 2/3 shutout innings before Todd Zeile's home run in the sixth put the Orioles on the board. Eddie Murray's leadoff home run in the eighth made it 6-2 Yankees. In the ninth, John Wetteland relieved Pettitte and allowed a two-out two-run home run to Bobby Bonilla before Cal Ripken grounded out to end the series and send the Yankees to the World Series.|$|R
5000|$|He had 15 {{home runs}} by the All-Star break, the most ever by a Mets rookie {{in the first}} half, ahead of Benny Agbayani (11 in 1999) and Ike Davis (11 in 2010). [...] After he commented during a TV {{interview}} that he loved hitting fastballs, he began seeing a lot more breaking balls, and hit only four more on the season. Still, his 19 home runs stood as a Mets rookie record until <b>Darryl</b> <b>Strawberry's</b> 26 in [...] His rookie fielding percentage was a below-league-average [...]947, however, he had nine outfield assists. For his efforts, he was selected to 1965 Topps All-Star Rookie Team. His 1966 Topps baseball card was imprinted with a gold trophy symbol.

50|$|<b>Darryl</b> Eugene <b>Strawberry</b> Sr. (born March 12, 1962) is an American former {{professional}} baseball right fielder and an ordained Christian minister and author. Strawberry {{is well known}} for his 17-year career in Major League Baseball (MLB). Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Strawberry {{was one of the most}} feared sluggers in the sport, known for his prodigious home runs and his intimidating presence in the batter's box with his 6-foot-6 frame and his long, looping swing that elicited comparisons to Ted Williams.|$|R
25|$|However, the {{signature}} {{game of the}} series was Game 6. Needing a win to get to Mike Scott (who had been dominant in the series) in Game 7, the Astros jumped off to a 30 lead {{in the first inning}} but neither team would score again until the 9th inning. In the 9th, starting pitcher Bob Knepper would give two runs, and once again the Astros would look to Dave Smith to close it out. However, Smith would walk Gary Carter and <b>Darryl</b> <b>Strawberry,</b> giving up a sacrifice fly to Ray Knight, tying the game. Despite having the go-ahead runs on base, Smith was able to escape the inning without any further damage.|$|E
25|$|Whatever the {{reasoning}} behind the decision was, McNamara called upon his closer Schiraldi {{in the bottom of}} the eighth inning for a potential two-inning save. Lee Mazzilli, pinch hitting for Jesse Orosco, who recorded the final out of the eighth, led off the inning with a single. Lenny Dykstra then reached on an attempted sacrifice to put two runners on. Wally Backman followed with another bunt to move Mazzilli and Dykstra into scoring position, and Schiraldi intentionally walked Keith Hernandez to load the bases for Gary Carter. Schiraldi ran up a 3-0 count on Carter, but Carter swung at the next pitch and flied to left, deep enough to score Mazzilli and tie the game. With Dykstra now on third, <b>Darryl</b> <b>Strawberry</b> stood in with a chance to drive in the go-ahead run. Instead, Strawberry flied out to end the inning.|$|E
25|$|There was no scoring {{until the}} 14th inning when the Mets {{would take the}} lead on a Wally Backman single and an error by left fielder Billy Hatcher. The Astros would get the run back {{in the bottom of}} the 14th when Hatcher (in a classic goat-to-hero-conversion-moment) hit one of the most {{dramatic}} home runs in NLCS history, off the left field foul pole. In the 16th inning, <b>Darryl</b> <b>Strawberry</b> doubled to lead off the inning and Ray Knight drove him home in the next at-bat. The Mets would score a total of three runs in the inning to take what appeared an insurmountable 74 lead. With their season on the line, the Astros would nonetheless rally for two runs to come to within 76. Kevin Bass came up with the tying and winning runs on base; however Jesse Orosco would strike him out, ending the game.|$|E
50|$|The Yankees struck {{first on}} Bernie Williams's two-run {{home run in}} the top of the first off of Rocky Coppinger. The Orioles cut the lead to 2-1 in the bottom of the inning on Rafael Palmeiro's {{sacrifice}} fly with runners on first and third off of Kenny Rogers. <b>Darryl</b> <b>Strawberry's</b> leadoff home run next inning made it 3-1 Yankees, but Chris Hoiles's lead off {{home run in the}} third again cut their lead to one. Paul O'Neill's two-run home in the fourth extended the Yankees' lead to 5-2, but in the bottom of the inning, Rogers allowed a walk and single to put runners on first and third with no outs for the Orioles. David Weathers in relief allowed an RBI single to B.J. Surhoff and groundout to Hoiles that again cut the Yankees' lead to one. Weathers and three relieved held Baltimore scoreless for the rest of the game while the Yankees padded their lead in the eighth. Williams hit a one-out double off of Alan Mills, who was relieved by Jesse Orosco. After Tino Martinez singled, Armando Benitez relieved Orosco and allowed an RBI groundout to Cecil Fielder before Strawberry's second home run of the game made it 8-4 Yankees. The Orioles in the bottom of the inning hit three straight leadoff singles to load the bases with no outs off of Mariano Rivera, who struck out Hoiles and Brady Anderson, then got Todd Zeile to pop up to short to end the inning. John Wetteland retired the Orioles in order in the ninth to give the Yankees a 3-1 series lead.|$|R
25|$|Still {{trailing}} 3–0 {{and having}} only one hit {{to show for}} their outing so far, the New York bats came alive {{in the bottom of}} the sixth against Hurst. After recording the first out, pinch hitter Lee Mazzilli and Mookie Wilson recorded back to back hits and Tim Teufel drew a walk to load the bases. Keith Hernandez singled to drive in Mazzilli and Wilson, and Gary Carter followed with a liner to right that Evans dove to try to catch but could not come up with. Pinch runner Wally Backman, who came in to run for Teufel, scored the tying run but Hernandez, who had to wait and see if the ball was going to be caught by Evans, got a late jump and was thrown out as Evans was able to relay the throw to Spike Owen. Hernandez got into an argument with right field umpire Dale Ford, claiming that his delay in ruling on Evans' play caused him to wait too long before advancing. With two outs, Hurst faced <b>Darryl</b> <b>Strawberry</b> and retired him.|$|E
25|$|Having {{only one}} base runner since the third inning, the Red Sox mounted {{a rally in}} the top of the eighth. Bill Buckner led off with a single. Jim Rice {{followed}} with one, and Evans hit a double after that to drive Buckner and Rice in and cut the lead to one. Davey Johnson brought in Jesse Orosco to try and stop the rally with the tying run now in scoring position. Orosco retired Gedman on a lineout, struck Henderson out, and induced a groundout to pinch hitter Don Baylor to strand Evans in scoring position. McNamara brought in Al Nipper, who started and lost Game 4, to pitch the bottom half. <b>Darryl</b> <b>Strawberry</b> led off with a home run to make the score 7-5. Knight singled and advanced to second on a groundout by Dykstra. Santana was intentionally walked to get to the pitcher's spot, and Orosco helped his cause by singling to center to drive in Knight. Steve Crawford then came in to face Wilson and hit him, loading the bases. Backman then grounded into a force retiring Santana, and Hernandez grounded out and ended the inning.|$|E
