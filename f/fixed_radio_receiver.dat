40|$|Studies are {{underway}} at JPL {{in the emerging}} area of Satellite Sound Broadcast Service (SSBS) for direct reception by low cost portable, semi portable, mobile and <b>fixed</b> <b>radio</b> <b>receivers.</b> This paper addresses the portable reception of digital broadcasting of monophonic audio with source material band limited to 5 KHz (source audio comparable to commercial AM broadcasting). The proposed system provides transmission robustness, uniformity of performance over the coverage area and excellent frequency reuse. Propagation problems associated with indoor portable reception are considered in detail and innovative antenna concepts are suggested to mitigate these problems. It is shown that, with the marriage of proper technologies a single medium power satellite can provide substantial direct satellite audio broadcast capability to CONUS in UHF or L Bands, for high quality portable indoor reception by low cost <b>radio</b> <b>receivers...</b>|$|R

50|$|Colonel Green had an {{artificial}} leg {{that made it}} difficult to walk, so he used a small electric car, which he equipped with a <b>radio</b> <b>receiver,</b> to travel around the estate grounds.

50|$|The {{information}} {{produced by}} the receiver {{may be in the}} form of sound, images, or data. A <b>radio</b> <b>receiver</b> may be a separate piece of electronic equipment, or an electronic circuit within another device. <b>Radio</b> <b>receivers</b> are components of communications, broadcasting, remote control, and network systems. In consumer electronics, the terms <b>radio</b> and <b>radio</b> <b>receiver</b> are often used specifically for receivers designed to reproduce sound transmitted by radio broadcasting stations, historically the first mass-market commercial radio application.|$|R
40|$|To study {{horseshoe}} crab Limulus polyphemus spawning behavior and migration over a large-spatial extent (> 100 km), we arrayed <b>fixed</b> station <b>radio</b> <b>receivers</b> throughout Delaware Bay and deployed radio transmitters and archival tags on adult {{horseshoe crab}}s {{prior to their}} spawning season. We tagged and released 160 females and 60 males in 2004 and 217 females in 2005. The array covered approximately 140 km of shoreline. Recapture rates were > 70 % with multi-year recaptures. We categorized adult age by carapace wear. Older females tended to spawn {{earlier in the season}} and more frequently than young females, but those tendencies were more apparent in 2004 when spawning overall occurred earlier than in 2005 when spawning was delayed possibly due to decreased water temperatures. Timing of initial spawning within a year was correlated with water temperature. After adjusting for day of first spring tide, the day of first spawning was 4 days earlier for every 1 degree (°C) rise in mean daily water temperature in May. Seventy nine % of spawning occurred during nighttime high tides. Fifty five % of spawning occurred within 3 d of a spring tide, which was slightly higher than the 47 % expected if spawning was uniformly distributed regardless of tidal cycle. Within the same spawning season, males and females were observed spawning or intertidally resting at more than one beach separated by > 5 km. Between years, most (77 %) did not return to spawn at the same beach. Probability of stranding was strongly age dependent for males and females with older adults experiencing higher stranding rates. Horseshoe crabs staging in the shallow waters east of the channel spawned exclusively along the eastern (NJ) shoreline, but those staging west of the channel spawned throughout the bay. Overall, several insights emerged from the use of radio telemetry, which advances our understanding of horseshoe crab ecology and will be useful in conserving the Delaware Bay horseshoe crab population and habitats[Current Zoology 56 (5) : 563 – 574, 2010]...|$|R
