25|$|Researchers in the United States have {{undertaken}} field evaluations of <b>in-vehicle</b> devices that monitor driver behaviours and fuel consumption. Studies that tested {{the use of}} <b>in-vehicle</b> monitoring in emergency medical services (EMS) reported substantial improvements in driver behaviour through <b>in-vehicle</b> monitoring systems that gave drivers real-time feedback. The researchers reported that the technology demonstrated sustained cost savings in regards to vehicle maintenance and required minimal retraining of drivers. Another study of EMS drivers reported similar results and recommended gradual implementation of <b>in-vehicle</b> monitoring, with attention to defusing potential concerns regarding a punitive approach to corrective action.|$|E
25|$|The <b>in-vehicle</b> eCall is {{generated}} either manually by the vehicle occupants or automatically via activation of <b>in-vehicle</b> sensors after an accident. When activated, the <b>in-vehicle</b> eCall device will establish an emergency call carrying both voice and data {{directly to the}} nearest emergency point (normally the nearest E1-1-2 public-safety answering point, PSAP). The voice call enables the vehicle occupant {{to communicate with the}} trained eCall operator. At the same time, a minimum set of data will be sent to the eCall operator receiving the voice call.|$|E
25|$|A 2009 FHWA {{intelligent}} systems study {{suggested that a}} combined infrastructure-based and <b>in-vehicle</b> warning could be highly effective in reducing crossing path crashes and fatalities at signalized intersections.|$|E
25|$|Several {{operating}} systems for smart devices, such as smartphones, tablet computers, smart TVs, and <b>in-vehicle</b> infotainment (IVI) systems, {{are based on}} Linux. Major platforms for such systems include Android, FirefoxOS, Mer and Tizen.|$|E
25|$|Android {{has become}} the {{dominant}} mobile operating system for smartphones, running on 79.3% of units sold worldwide during {{the second quarter of}} 2013. Android is also a popular operating system for tablets, and Android smart TVs and <b>in-vehicle</b> infotainment systems have also appeared in the market.|$|E
25|$|GPS based methods. An {{increasing}} number of vehicles are equipped with <b>in-vehicle</b> satnav/GPS (satellite navigation) systems that have two-way communication with a traffic data provider. Position readings from these vehicles are used to compute vehicle speeds. Modern methods may not use dedicated hardware but instead Smartphone based solutions using so called Telematics 2.0 approaches.|$|E
25|$|Mechanical vehicle {{switching}} minimizes inter-vehicle spacing or headway distance, but it {{also increases}} the minimum distances between consecutive junctions. A mechanically switching vehicle, maneuvering between two adjacent junctions with different switch settings, cannot proceed from one junction to the next. The vehicle must adopt a new switch position, and then wait for the <b>in-vehicle</b> switch's locking mechanism to be verified. If the vehicle switching is faulty, that vehicle {{must be able to}} stop before reaching the next switch, and all vehicles approaching the failed vehicle would be affected.|$|E
25|$|Most {{designers}} avoid track switching, instead advocating vehicle-mounted switches or conventional steering. Those designers {{say that}} vehicle-switching permits faster switching, so vehicles can be closer together. It also simplifies the guideway, makes junctions less visually obtrusive {{and reduces the}} impact of malfunctions, because a failed switch on one vehicle {{is less likely to}} affect other vehicles. Other designers point out that track-switching simplifies the vehicles, reducing the number of small moving parts in each car. Track-switching replaces <b>in-vehicle</b> mechanisms with larger track-moving components, that can be designed for durability with little regard for weight or size.|$|E
25|$|The Land Transport Authority (LTA) in Singapore {{implemented}} an Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) {{scheme to}} deter traffic congestion during peak hours at various roads. The ERP scheme requires electronic gantries {{to be placed}} over the road at designated locations and that cars be equipped with an <b>In-Vehicle</b> Unit (IU), a rectangular device pasted on the inside bottom right of the front windscreen from the driver's view, which will deduct the toll price from a CashCard. The CashCard must be inserted into the device, and {{failure to do so}} is in violation of law. There is no charge for entering the area during certain non-peak times.|$|E
25|$|The minimum {{set of data}} {{contains}} {{information about}} the incident, including time, precise location, the direction the vehicle was traveling, and vehicle identification. The pan-European eCall aims to be operative for all new type-approved vehicles as a standard option. Depending on the manufacturer of the eCall system, it could be mobile phone based (Bluetooth connection to an <b>in-vehicle</b> interface), an integrated eCall device, or a functionality of a broader system like navigation, Telematics device, or tolling device. eCall {{is expected to be}} offered, at earliest, by the end of 2010, pending standardization by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute and commitment from large EU member states such as France and the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Advancing {{technology}} {{since the}} mid-2000s led to chasers more commonly targeting less amenable areas (i.e. hilly or forested) {{that were previously}} eschewed when continuous wide visibility was critical. These advancements, particularly <b>in-vehicle</b> weather data such as radar, also led {{to an increase in}} chasing after nightfall. Most chasing remains during daylight hours with active storm intercepting peaking from mid-late afternoon through early-to-mid evening. This is dictated by a chaser's schedule (availability to chase) and by when storms form, which usually is around peak heating during the mid-to-late afternoon but on some days occurs in early afternoon or even in the morning. An additional advantage of later season storms is that days are considerably longer than in early spring. Morning or early afternoon storms tend to be associated with stronger wind shear and thus most often happen earlier in the spring season or later during the fall season.|$|E
500|$|Several Microsoft related brands {{also appear}} in the game. Alan and Alice Wake's car shows that it has the Microsoft-powered Ford Sync <b>in-vehicle</b> {{entertainment}} system. An Xbox 360 console {{can be seen in}} one section of the game, with the box of the fictional Night Springs video game next to it, which are collectibles in [...] "The Writer" [...] DLC episode. In multiple sections of the game, Microsoft Tag bar codes can be seen; these can be scanned in real life by the user with the appropriate software on their mobile device. When scanned, these tags redirect players to a phone number with the voicemail from one of the game's character, or to a Verizon-sponsored web site where users gain access to exclusive Alan Wake extras for their console. This functionality is only available in the United States.|$|E

2500|$|Roads in the United Kingdom form {{a network}} of varied quality and capacity. Road {{distances}} are shown in miles or yards and UK speed limits are indicated in miles per hour (mph) or {{by the use of}} the national speed limit (NSL) symbol. Some vehicle categories have various lower maximum limits enforced by speed limiters. Enforcement of UK road speed limits increasingly uses speed guns, automated <b>in-vehicle</b> systems [...] and automated roadside traffic cameras. A unified numbering system is in place for Great Britain, whilst in Northern Ireland, there is no available explanation for the allocation of road numbers.|$|E
2500|$|Real-time traffic {{data can}} also be used in the design of new roadways or {{modification}} of existing systems as the data could [...] be used to provide accurate origin-destination studies and turning-movement counts for uses in transportation forecasting and traffic operations. Such technology would also lead to improvements for transport engineers to address problems whilst reducing the cost of obtaining and compiling data. Tolling is another prospect for VII technology as it could enable roadways to be automatically tolled. Data could be collectively transmitted to road users for <b>in-vehicle</b> display, outlining the lowest cost, shortest distance, and/or fastest route to a destination on the basis of real-time conditions.|$|E
2500|$|AVL {{technology}} is predominately used when applying vehicle tracking to fleet or driver management solutions. [...] The use of Automatic Vehicle Location {{is given in}} the following scenario; A car breaks down {{by the side of}} the road and the occupant calls a vehicle recovery company. The vehicle recovery company has several vehicles operating in the area. [...] Without needing to call each driver to check his location the dispatcher can pinpoint the nearest recovery vehicle and assign it to the new job. [...] If you were to incorporate the other aspects of vehicle telematics into this scenario; the dispatcher, rather than phoning the recovery vehicle operative, could transmit the job details directly to the operative’s mobile data device, who would then use the <b>in-vehicle</b> satellite navigation to aid his journey to the job.|$|E
2500|$|The second-generation (2001-2003) Oldsmobile Aurora {{was very}} well {{equipped}} from the factory, as was expected of a luxury vehicle.

2500|$|However, [...] {{concentrations}} in vehicles and near roadways are appreciably {{higher than those}} measured at monitors in the current network. In fact, <b>in-vehicle</b> concentrations can be 2–3 times higher than measured at nearby area-wide monitors. Near-roadway (within about [...] ) concentrations of NO2 have been measured to be approximately 30 to 100% higher than concentrations away from roadways. Individuals who spend time on or near major roadways can experience short-term NO2 exposures considerably higher than measured by the current network. Approximately 16% of U.S. housing units are located within [...] of a major highway, railroad, or airport (approximately 48 million people). This population likely includes {{a higher proportion of}} non-white and economically-disadvantaged people. Studies show a connection between breathing elevated short-term NO2 concentrations, and increased visits to emergency departments and hospital admissions for respiratory issues, especially asthma. NO2 exposure concentrations near roadways are of particular concern for susceptible individuals, including asthmatics, children, and the elderly.|$|E
