5|$|In {{spite of}} the {{negative}} reception, the Wii version has had some positive reception. While Official Nintendo Magazine UK <b>editor</b> Tom East similarly bemoaned the motion controls, {{he felt that the}} multiplayer still held up, as it becomes balanced since the other players would have the same problems with the controls. 1UP.com <b>editor</b> Justin Haywald agreed, stating that while it made single player modes difficult, the game was meant to be played with friends. Game Informer <b>editor</b> Matt Helgeson, however, found the motion controls to be good, commenting that other developers should learn from Nintendo. In spite of this, fellow Game Informer <b>editor</b> Matthew Kato described the controls as being only so-so. GameShark <b>editor</b> Danielle Riendeau, however, described the controls as excellent, though adding that it occasionally misreads her shots. In the first four days of the Wii version's release in Japan, Mario Power Tennis sold 56,000 copies. By January 3, 2010, it had sold 205,070 copies in Japan.|$|E

5|$|The StarCraft II <b>Editor</b> is a campaign, map, and mod <b>editor.</b> It is {{far more}} {{sophisticated}} than StarCrafts StarEdit and s World <b>Editor</b> for creating custom maps and campaigns, {{and it is the}} first <b>editor</b> by Blizzard to feature built-in mod creation and usage support. Updated art and data from the original StarCraft that were not used, along with models and data that were scrapped during the development process (including those made as April Fools jokes) will be available in the <b>editor.</b> Unlike previous editors made by Blizzard, it is the first to have Internet connectivity features such as map publishing, retrieval, and online activation of the <b>editor</b> client. Lead producer Chris Sigaty has stated that the <b>editor</b> gives players the ability to create role-playing, Hero-type units and structures resembling those from WarCraft III.

30|$|Alarmingly, in {{addition}} to the differences between <b>editors</b> and managers, there is also a sharp rift among <b>editors</b> of the same social group—a growing tension between senior <b>editors</b> and junior <b>editors.</b> Compared with senior <b>editors,</b> most junior <b>editors</b> are confronted with more challenges, including signing contracts based on shorter time periods, taking more challenging tasks with intense work pressure, and receiving fewer opportunities for promotion, but facing more severe financial repercussions if they fail to meet their annual workload or generate the amount of profit specified in their contracts. Therefore, the internal differences within knowledge workers, embodied in the division between <b>editors</b> and managers, as well as the division of <b>editors</b> in the same social group, have widened and become increasingly obvious.|$|R

50|$|Vector <b>editors</b> {{are often}} contrasted with bitmap <b>editors,</b> and their {{capabilities}} complement each other.

Bitmap <b>editors</b> are {{more suitable for}} retouching, photo processing, photorealistic illustrations, collage, and illustrations drawn by hand with a pen tablet. Recent versions of bitmap <b>editors</b> such as GIMP and Adobe Photoshop support vector tools (e.g. editable paths), and vector <b>editors</b> such as Adobe Fireworks, Adobe FreeHand, Adobe Illustrator, Affinity Designer, Animatron, Artboard, Autodesk Graphic (formerly iDraw), CorelDRAW, Sketch, Inkscape, sK1 or Xara Photo & Graphic Designer have adopted raster effects that were once limited to bitmap <b>editors</b> (e.g. blurring).|$|R
