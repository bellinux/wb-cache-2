5|$|Amy starts {{becoming}} more afflicted {{by the image}} of the Angel in her eye, and the Doctor instructs her to keep <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed,</b> preventing her from seeing it. Octavian has the clerics guard Amy while he, the Doctor, and River make for a secondary control room {{on the other side of}} the oxygen factory. During this, the Doctor learns that River is Octavian's prisoner, promised a full pardon if she helped capture the Angel. Octavian is killed by an Angel but this allows the Doctor and River to enter and secure the control room. They analyze the crack the Doctor saw and confirm that the leaking energy came from an explosion in time, and are able to narrow the date of the explosion's epicenter.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Amy and {{the clerics}} find the Angels {{moving away from}} the primary control room. One cleric goes to investigate, and finds the crack has grown wider, but then is soon {{consumed}} by it. Amy remembers this cleric, but none of the others do, as he had been erased from time. The crack continues to grow, and soon the other clerics are similarly consumed. The Doctor directs Amy to keep <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed</b> and work her way to the secondary control room, hoping that the Angels will not recognise that her eyes are shut. Amy falters and trips, but as the Angels move in, River is able to teleport her to the secondary control room, rescuing her.|$|E
5|$|The next day, a Nazi U-boat appears and {{intercepts}} the ship. Belloq and Dietrich {{seize the}} Ark and Marion but cannot locate Jones, who stows away aboard the U-boat and travels {{with them to}} {{an island in the}} Aegean Sea. Once there, Belloq plans to test the power of the Ark before presenting it to Hitler. Jones reveals himself and threatens to destroy the Ark with a panzerfaust, but Belloq calls his bluff and Jones surrenders rather than destroy such an important historical artifact. The Nazis take Indy and Marion to an area where the Ark will be opened and tie them to a post to observe. Belloq performs a ceremonial opening of the Ark, which appears to contain nothing but sand, all that remains of the Ten Commandments. Suddenly, angelic ghost-like beings emerge from the Ark. Indy cautions Marion to keep <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed</b> and not to observe what happens next. Belloq and the others look on in astonishment as the apparitions are suddenly revealed to be angels of death. A vortex of flame forms above the Ark and shoots bolts of fiery energy into the gathered Nazi soldiers, killing them all. As Belloq, Toht and Dietrich all scream in terror, the Ark turns its fury on them: Dietrich's head shrivels up, Toht's face is melted off his skull and Belloq's head explodes. Flames then engulf the remains of the doomed assembly, save for Indy and Marion, and the pillar of fire rises into the sky. The Ark's lid is blasted high into the air before dropping back down onto the Ark and sealing it. Jones and Marion find their ropes burned off and embrace.|$|E

50|$|Instrument myopia, {{sometimes}} called microscope myopia, {{is a form}} of myopia that occurs when someone is looking into an optical instrument such as a microscope. The person focusses his or <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closer</b> than needed for the image produced by the instrument.|$|R

25|$|On September 7, 1927, Philo Farnsworth's image {{dissector}} camera tube transmitted its first image, a simple straight line, at his laboratory at 202 Green Street in San Francisco. By September 3, 1928, Farnsworth had developed the system sufficiently to hold a demonstration for the press. This {{is widely regarded as}} the first electronic television demonstration. In 1929, the system was further improved by elimination of a motor generator, so that his television system now had no mechanical parts. That year, Farnsworth transmitted the first live human images with his system, including a three and a half-inch image of his wife Elma ("Pem") with <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed</b> (possibly due to the bright lighting required).|$|E
500|$|The {{black-and-white}} {{music video}} was noted to have predominantly dark, brooding, hazy, mysterious and sun-stroked imagery, and portrays Del Rey evoking her distinguished personality. Using a minimalist and melancholy approach, it features several artistic shots of California scenery and cameo appearances {{by two men}} portrayed as bad boy archetypes. Del Rey engages in 1960s apparition, numerous swaying and twirling actions, and sings with <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed</b> throughout the music video. CBS Corporation writer Courtney E. Smith described the clip as [...] "the yin and yang of youthful hope, the kind Hollywood lives by attracting, and cynical industry, the kind Hollywood thrives on but hides".|$|E
500|$|In Stockholm, Sweden, a {{group of}} identically dressed masked men, each handcuffed to a briefcase, are {{attacked}} in a subway. They are all killed, with one also having his hand cut off, and his briefcase taken. The attacker opens the briefcase and removes the box of diamonds it contains. Investigating the attack, Agent Phil Coulson discovers that the briefcases were randomly assigned, so no one knew which contained the diamonds, and that the attacker carried it out with <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed.</b> Civilian recruit and S.H.I.E.L.D. trainee Skye believes that extrasensory perception may be involved, but Coulson and Agent Melinda May doubt that such abilities exist. Using social media, the team discovers that the thief, who has been behind several other similar crimes, is former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Akela Amador. Coulson had trained Amador, and until now had believed her dead.|$|E

50|$|The {{book ends}} with Billy (now called Bill) caring for Barbara {{in his own}} home. At {{the very end of}} the book, Barbaras eyes open and she {{comments}} on a flock of Barn Swallows flying past. While <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>close</b> again, the ending seems promising for her imminent recovery.|$|R
500|$|During an {{interview}} with Ryan Seacrest on his radio show On Air with Ryan Seacrest, Rihanna revealed that she found [...] "You da One" [...] to be a highly addictive to listen to after she heard the final cut, saying You da One' {{is one of those}} records that became very addictive for me. I could not stop listening to this song. It's very infectious." [...] The artwork for the single was shot in black-and-white, the same technique which was used for Rihanna's previous single's artwork, [...] "We Found Love". [...] "You da Ones artwork displays the singer with her head tilted back and <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed</b> holding a cigarette between her lips. It prompted a mixed reaction from Sarah Anne Hughes for The Washington Post; while she noted that Rihanna looks [...] "perfectly coiffed," [...] she criticized the inclusion of the cigarette, and called it a [...] "social taboo." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of Fanaa, Kajol worked {{intermittently}} {{through the rest of}} the decade. She next starred in her husband's directorial debut, the drama U Me Aur Hum (2008) as Piya, a woman suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Devgn described Kajol's participation in the project by saying, [...] "She is always thorough with the nitty-gritties of her character before she begins shooting. Since the screenplay work happened at home, Kajol was present for all the sittings and even gave her inputs." [...] Upon release, the film performed moderately well at the box office and earned positive critical reviews for her performance. Udita Jhunjhunwala noted, [...] "Kajol completely comes into her own here as an ailing woman unaware of her vulnerability and delicate situation. She is superb." [...] Raja Sen added, [...] " [...] can span through happy-breezy with <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed,</b> and so the first half doesn't even pose her a challenge, but when Alzheimer's strikes Piya and she begins to forget all that matters in her life, Kajol raises the bar strikingly high." [...] The following year, Kajol received another Best Actress nomination at the Filmfare Awards ceremony.|$|E
500|$|Most of the Weeping Angels are not statue props {{but young}} women wearing masks, costumes, and paint that took {{two to three}} hours to apply. Director Adam Smith called them [...] "an {{absolute}} nightmare to film with" [...] because {{it took a long time}} for them to get ready and they had to stand still for long periods of time. In the climactic scene Gillan had to walk with <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed,</b> which she said was difficult and challenging as the ground was uneven and muddy. She stated that [...] "it was the most scary thing" [...] when she had to trip over a step and fall, even though she was aware of the crash mat. As she was not able to express herself through her eyes, Gillan had to make herself more animated to convey emotion. The scene in which the Doctor, Amy and River are horizontal in mid-air when the gravity field fails on the Byzantium was achieved by using wires and powerful wind machines. The blue in Amy's bedroom was an idea of Adam Smith to show that it was inspired by the TARDIS from Amy's encounter with the Doctor when she was young.|$|E
6000|$|Carl saw Ruth's {{head drop}} an inch, and <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>close</b> to a slit as she {{inspected}} him with sudden surprise. He {{knew that it}} had just occurred to her who he was. Their eyes exchanged understanding. [...] "She does get things," [...] he thought, and said, lightly: ...|$|R
60|$|She {{stepped forward}} with <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> nearly <b>closed,</b> like a sleep-walker in a beatific dream.|$|R

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by lead writer and {{executive}} producer Steven Moffat. He designed the two-part episode as a more action-oriented sequel to [...] "Blink", an episode he had written for the third series. He compared the relationship to the film Alien and its sequel Aliens, with the former being more low-key and the latter more [...] "highly coloured". Moffat thought that Aliens was [...] "the best conceived movie sequel ever" [...] and decided {{to use it as}} a model. He also intended to portray the Angels and their actions differently; in [...] "Blink" [...] they were barely surviving and resembled scavengers, while in [...] "The Time of Angels" [...] he wanted them to have a plan that could become [...] "almost like a war". The two-part story was intended to show the worst possible instance that could occur with the Weeping Angels, which was the inability to see, as explored in the second part, [...] "Flesh and Stone", when Amy must keep <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed.</b> Executive producer Piers Wenger thought that the Delirium Archive, the museum the Doctor and Amy visited at the beginning of the episode, needed to be explained, therefore Moffat named it [...] "the final resting place of the Headless Monks" [...] and sent it to him via text message. The Headless Monks themselves appeared in the mid-series finale of the next series, [...] "A Good Man Goes to War".|$|E
2500|$|In another version, Kali {{stipulates}} he {{will only}} marry the apsara if she keeps <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed</b> {{while they are}} in the forest (presumably making love). However, Kali leaves after their marriage and the birth of their son Svarocisa. Svarocisa grows up to become a very learned scholar of the Vedas and learns to speak the languages of all creatures from one of his three wives. He later marries a goddess and fathers Svarocisa Manu, one of the progenitors of mankind. (See Progeny) ...|$|E
2500|$|On February 5, 2009, Castor {{was found}} guilty of second degree murder in the {{poisoning}} death of David and of attempted second degree murder for overdosing her daughter Ashley with drugs and vodka. With a [...] "jam-packed" [...] courtroom, most were focused on Castor. She, however, had <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed</b> as the verdicts were read. Her lead defense counsel, Keller, announced that Castor would appeal the verdict, including challenging the inclusion of evidence regarding the death of her first husband, for which Castor had not been charged.|$|E

2500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Earth Intruders" [...] was {{directed}} by Michel Ocelot. It features Björk's face floating in the background, first upside down, then upright, singing with <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed.</b> In the foreground, {{a large group of}} silhouetted tribal warriors dance in time to the music. The video features psychedelic colours and patterns imposed on an earthy backdrop. The video ends with Björk's face slowly fading into the middle of a glade, her eyes being opened just as she sings the last lyric. Ocelot stated that Björk had originally wanted Kirikou to be featured as a 20-year-old in the video. It was accomplished within strict time constraints through a combination of live-action, silhouette animation, 3D computer graphics, traditional animation, cut-outs and other special effects. [...] "Kirikou" [...] was danced by Legrand Bemba-Debert in a costume made, based on Ocelot's ideas, by paper sculptor Anne-Lise Kœhler. The full video was made available in the iTunes Store on April 24, 2007. It was nominated for the 2007 Q Award for Best Video.|$|E

50|$|In {{one last}} {{glimpse of the}} killer's sadistic nature, after the credits, a clip is shown of the face {{of one of his}} bound victims in close up.

After a period of {{prolonged}} hyperventilation, the film ends as <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>close.</b>|$|R
