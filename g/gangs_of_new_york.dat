5|$|Also in 2002, DiCaprio {{appeared}} in Martin Scorsese's <b>Gangs</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> a historical film {{set in the}} mid-19th century in the Five Points district of New York City. Director Scorsese initially struggled selling his idea of realizing the film until DiCaprio became interested in playing protagonist Amsterdam Vallon, a young leader of the Irish faction, and thus, Miramax Films got involved with financing the project. Nonetheless production on the film was plagued by blown-out budgets and producer-director squabbles, resulting in a marathon eight-month shoot and, at US$103 million, the most expensive film Scorsese had ever made. Upon its release, <b>Gangs</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> became a financial and critical success. DiCaprio's acting was well-received but was overshadowed by Daniel Day-Lewis' performance among most critics.|$|E
5|$|Scorsese's complex filmmaking {{commitments}} to multiple film projects {{resulted in an}} early legal challenge before filming of Silence could be initiated. In August 2012, Cecchi Gori Pictures sued Scorsese over an alleged breach of contract agreements related to Silence. According to the company, in 1990 Scorsese signed a written agreement to direct Silence. Scorsese was supposed to shoot the film following 1997's Kundun, and Cecchi Gori Pictures had apparently invested more than $750,000 for this purpose. However, Scorsese chose to make Bringing Out the Dead, <b>Gangs</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> and The Aviator first.|$|E

5|$|Verbinski cast James Gandolfini as Carl Hanratty, Ed Harris as Frank Abagnale, Sr., and Chloë Sevigny as Brenda Strong. Verbinski {{dropped out}} because of DiCaprio's {{commitment}} on <b>Gangs</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> Lasse Hallström was in negotiations to direct by May 2001, but dropped out in July 2001. At this stage Harris and Sevigny left the film, but Gandolfini was still attached. Spielberg, co-founder of DreamWorks, offered the job of director to Miloš Forman, and considered hiring Cameron Crowe. During this negotiation period, Spielberg began to consider directing the film himself, eventually dropping projects such as Big Fish and Memoirs of a Geisha. Spielberg officially committed to directing in August 2001.|$|E

5000|$|Since the {{earliest}} days <b>of</b> <b>gang</b> activity, <b>New</b> <b>York</b> and Chicago {{have always been the}} east coast and Midwest centers of underworld activity, and with the wealth and power obtained from Prohibition, the crime bosses bought political influence and started to gain more power. The <b>New</b> <b>York</b> and Chicago bosses began establishing their influence over underworld rules and policies across the United States, giving them control over the smaller gangs in other cities and territories, always moving forward towards organization and control on a national level. The idea for a nationally organized crime syndicate was started by bosses Arnold [...] "The Brain" [...] Rothstein and John [...] "The Fox" [...] Torrio <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> By the mid-1920s, a <b>new</b> generation <b>of</b> underworld leaders had seen the potential of organizing crime on a national level and began to move in that direction. Younger, intelligent and highly motivated gangsters such as Charlie [...] "Lucky" [...] Luciano and Meyer [...] "The Brain" [...] Lansky began to exert their power and influence in the underworld and Americanize its traditions and business practices. These new like-minded leaders began to strengthen their underworld ties by aligning themselves in joint business ventures, without including the older and more established leaders. A common ideology of business, crime and politics, usually referred to as the Big 3, fast became the [...] "Holy Trinity" [...] among these new leaders and while cooperating with each other they used it as one of their basic operating principles.|$|R

25|$|With a {{production}} budget {{said to be}} in excess of $100 million, <b>Gangs</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> was Scorsese's biggest and arguably most mainstream venture to date. Like The Age of Innocence, it was set in 19th-century New York, although focusing {{on the other end of}} the social scale (and like that film, also starring Daniel Day-Lewis). The film also marked the first collaboration between Scorsese and actor Leonardo DiCaprio, who since then has become a fixture in later Scorsese films. The production was highly troubled, with many rumors referring to the director's conflict with Miramax boss Harvey Weinstein. Despite denials of artistic compromise, <b>Gangs</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> revealed itself to be the director's most conventional film: standard film tropes that the director had traditionally avoided, such as characters existing purely for exposition purposes and explanatory flashbacks, here surfaced in abundance. The original score composed by regular Scorsese collaborator Elmer Bernstein was rejected at a late stage for a score by Howard Shore and mainstream rock artists U2 and Peter Gabriel.|$|E
