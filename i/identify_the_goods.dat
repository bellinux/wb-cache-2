40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is to offer a theory of the {{constitutive}} value of intellectual character due to its transformative influence. The specific transformative influence ascribed to intellectual character is that it counteracts self-deceptive mechanisms and disposes agents to obtain true beliefs and to avoid false beliefs. The true beliefs such character reliably produces are accurate representations, and not merely of empirical inputs but also conceptual schemes. Agents {{do not appear to}} require such accurate representations to fulfill various desires, or to achieve certain aspects of mental, social and physical well-being as identified by some psychologists. Consequently, agents do not require intellectual character to achieve a variety of things some have identified as good. Nonetheless, a distinction can be made between achieving <b>the</b> <b>good</b> and <b>identifying</b> <b>the</b> <b>good,</b> and it can also be acknowledged that <b>the</b> <b>good</b> is itself a matter of dispute. That is, {{there are a number of}} competing notions of <b>the</b> <b>good,</b> which appear to be influenced by various conceptual schemes, and this makes the identification of <b>the</b> <b>good</b> difficult. Intellectual character can fulfill a valuable role in the attempt to settle such disputes through its ability to facilitate true beliefs concerning <b>the</b> <b>good.</b> In fact, intellectual character is necessary to assure agents that their beliefs concerning <b>the</b> <b>good</b> are true due to the imperceptible mechanisms of self-deception. This assurance is itself valuable for any agent who wants to <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> due to <b>the</b> indispensable role of true belief in attempts to <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> <b>good.</b> Even further, identification of <b>the</b> <b>good</b> is valuable for any agent who wants to achieve <b>the</b> <b>good,</b> since <b>the</b> attempt to <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> better facilitates achievement of <b>the</b> <b>good.</b> Consequently, <b>the</b> assurance that intellectual character is necessary for is valuable for agents who both want to <b>identify</b> and achieve <b>the</b> <b>good,</b> and for this reason such character is constitutively valuable...|$|R

The method was applying the emerging technology into the traditional supermarket shopping system, which improved the profitability and management level of supermarkets.|$|E

In a typical RFID enabled logistics and supply chain application, there exist RFID readers to detect and <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> with RFID tags attached.

Many algorithms and models to improve the RFID reading have been proposed, yet most of them focus on addressing the problem in a single reading node. In this paper, we introduce a P 2 P model to identify and remove inaccurate reading of RFID data by utilizing the information exchanged among related nodes along the business processing route of each RFID tagged item. The successful deployment of this model will ease the demand for high accurate reading of each RFID reading node while reducing the total cost of the RFID network.
