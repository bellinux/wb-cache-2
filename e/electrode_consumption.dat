Liquid overall recirculation and mixing were induced only by hydrogen microbubbles electrochemically generated from the cathode. This application {{was carried out in}} a 20 L external-loop air liftreactor both under semi-batch and continuous flow conditions.

The effects of conductivity and pH agreed with the literature.

Although the Al(OH) 3 produced by the anodic Al dissolution is more effective in coagulating the pollutants in wastewater, the passivation of Al anodes and impermeable film formed on cathodes may and does interfere with the performance of electro-coagulation and electro-flotation (Holt et al. 2005).

40|$|Synopsis: {{increasing}} {{the production rate}} of an Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) while also lowering overall cost can be a difficult challenge. The current situation at OneSteel in Australia is natural gas is less expensive than electricity to melt steel. The question then becomes {{how to use the}} natural gas efficiently. During the bore in and melting stages of the first and second buckets of scrap, the transfer of energy from the gas burners to the scrap metal is very high. Once the scrap has partially melted and a flat bath is obtained, the energy transfer drops dramatically. Determining the optimum time to turn off the gas burners to obtain maximum energy efficiency became the goal. GrafTech International's ArchiTech system can be used to measure electrical harmonics generated by the arc in the furnace. As the scrap is melted in the furnace, the harmonics generated decrease. OneSteel and GrafTech used this signal to develop a control loop to determine when to turn off the burners allowing them to maximize production rates. Power on time decreased, allowing for higher production rates and lower energy costs. Other consumables, such as graphite <b>electrodes</b> and refractory <b>consumption</b> should also decrease...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The aim is {{to build}} a {{mathematical}} model of the electric arc of arc furnace (EAF). The model should clearly show the relationship between the main parameters of the arc. These parameters determine the properties of the arc and the possibility of optimization of melting mode. Methodology. We have built a fairly simple model of the arc, which satisfies the above requirements. The model is designed for the analysis of electromagnetic processes arc of varying length. We have compared the results obtained when testing the model with the results obtained on actual furnaces. Results. During melting in real chipboard under the influence of changes in temperature changes its properties arc plasma. The proposed model takes into account these changes. Adjusting the length of the arc is the main way to regulate the mode of smelting chipboard. The arc length is controlled by the movement of the drive electrode. The model reflects the dynamic changes in the parameters of the arc when changing her length. We got the dynamic current-voltage characteristics (CVC) of the arc for the different stages of melting. We got the arc voltage waveform and identified criteria by which possible identified stage of smelting. Originality. In contrast to the previously known models, this model clearly shows the relationship between the main parameters of the arc EAF: arc voltage Ud, amperage arc id and length arc d. Comparison of the simulation results and experimental data obtained from real particleboard showed the adequacy of the constructed model. It was found that character of change of magnitude Md, helps determine the stage of melting. Practical value. It turned out that the model can be used to simulate smelting in EAF any capacity. Thus, when designing the system of control mechanism for moving the electrode, the model takes into account changes in the parameters of the arc and it can significantly reduce <b>electrode</b> material <b>consumption</b> and energy consumption during smelting...|$|R
40|$|Oxygen {{consumption}} of collagenase-liberated rat adipocytes {{was measured by}} two different techniques: a microspectrophotometric method using hemoglobin as indicator of respiration and a technique using the oxygen electrode. These two completely different techniques gave similar values for oxygen consumption. With the spectrophotometric method, the oxygen {{consumption of}} single fat cells was determined. A close positive correlation (r = greater than 0. 90) between oxygen consumption and fat cell size was observed in each tissue examined. With the oxygen <b>electrode</b> technique, oxygen <b>consumption</b> of adipocyte suspensions from young (40 days, 180 g) and old (90 days, 480 g) rats was examined. Fat cells of the suspensions were separated into classes of different size by a flotation technique. A significant positive correlation between fat cell size and oxygen consumption was observed in both young (r = 0. 88) and old (r = 0. 95) rats. However, the slope was much steeper in young rats. At a cell weight of 0. 1 microgram the oxygen consumption was 0. 364 and 0. 086 microL O 2 / 10 (6) cells/min- 1 in young and old rats, respectively. In the literature, a number of separate metabolic pathways {{have been found to}} be related positively to fat cell size and negatively to age. We conclude that these scattered metabolic observations are in agreement with integrated data on energy expenditure as evaluated from oxygen consumption. Estimations of the energy expenditure of adipose tissue indicates that this tissue is responsible for about 1 % and 0. 5 % of the total energy expenditure in young and old rats, respectively...|$|R
