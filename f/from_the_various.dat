5|$|At {{the start}} of the conclave, electors from the zelanti faction {{attempted}} to elect Giuseppe Renato Imperiali, but this was not possible because of his unpopularity with both France and Spain. Following this attempt cardinals representing the Bourbons insisted that no serious attempt to elect a new pope take place until all cardinals who were traveling had arrived, and until the electors had received instructions <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>various</b> Catholic monarchs.|$|E

5|$|In between General Council sessions, {{approximately}} 300 {{elected representatives}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>various</b> districts and foreign mission areas meet as the General Presbytery. When the General Council {{is not in}} session, the General Presbytery acts as the official policy-making body of the Assemblies of God. A 20-member Executive Presbytery, led by the Executive Leadership Team, meets bimonthly and functions as the Assemblies of God's board of directors. Executive Presbyters are responsible to the General Presbytery and are ex officio members of that body.|$|E

5|$|Since the Confederacy was founded, {{among other}} things, on states' rights, one {{important}} factor in Davis's choice of cabinet members was representation <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>various</b> states. He depended partly upon recommendations from congressmen and other prominent people. This helped maintain good relations between the executive and legislative branches. This also led to complaints as more states joined the Confederacy, however, because there were more states than cabinet positions.|$|E

5|$|A {{coincidental}} upswing in {{the fortunes}} of several studios was publicly explained by Code proponents such as the Motion Picture Herald as proof positive that the code was working. Another fortunate coincidence for Code supporters was the torrent of famous criminals such as John Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson, and Bonnie and Clyde that were killed by police shortly after the PCA took power. Corpses of the outlaws were shown in newsreels around the country, alongside clips of Al Capone and Machine Gun Kelly in Alcatraz. Among the unarguably positive aspects of the Code being enforced was the money it saved studios in having to edit, cut, and alter films to get approval <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>various</b> state boards and censors. The money saved was in the millions annually. A spate of more wholesome family films featuring performers such as Shirley Temple took off.|$|E

5|$|A {{government}} inquiry {{was undertaken}} {{to determine the}} future use of the pipelines, and took evidence <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>various</b> stakeholders, most of whom presented the case that favored their companies or industry. The inquiry concluded that the pipelines should be sold for continued use in transporting petroleum. An auction for the pipelines was announced in 1946, {{which was designed to}} give preference to bidders who intended to use them for moving petroleum. 16 bids were received, with the highest cash bidders being companies hoping to use the pipelines for natural gas. Assessing the different bids proved difficult and the discussions became enmeshed in national politics, with companies seeking support from various Washington politicians. Meanwhile, a threatened national coal strike raised concerns over the availability of natural gas, strengthening the arguments of the natural gas lobby.|$|E
5|$|After outrunning Duckworth on 26 December, Willaumez sailed for the South Atlantic, {{intending}} to {{pass into the}} Indian Ocean and cruise off the Cape of Good Hope {{in anticipation of the}} arrival of the British China Fleet. The China Fleet was a large annual convoy of East Indiamen that originated in Canton and passed through the Malacca Straits, across the Indian Ocean, around the Cape of Good Hope and then north through the Atlantic Ocean, arriving in British waters six to eight months after departure. During the passage, the convoy gathered ships <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>various</b> British colonies in the Indian Ocean and by the time it passed the southern tip of Africa it often contained dozens of vessels. By combining the heavy armaments of the East Indiamen with a strong Royal Navy escort, the China Fleet became a formidable target for French raiding squadrons: at the Battle of Pulo Aura in February 1804, an unescorted China Fleet drove off a powerful French squadron under Contre-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Durand Linois after a sharp encounter.|$|E
5|$|By this time, Agesilaus's army, after {{brushing}} off {{attacks from}} the Thessalians during its march through that country, {{had arrived in}} Boeotia, where it was met by an army gathered <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>various</b> states of the anti-Spartan alliance. Agesilaus's force from Asia, composed largely of emancipated helots and mercenary veterans of the Ten Thousand, was augmented by half a Spartan regiment from Orchomenus, and another half a regiment that had been transported across the Gulf of Corinth. These armies met each other at Coronea, in Theban territory; as at Nemea, both right wings were victorious, with the Thebans breaking through {{while the rest of}} the allies were defeated. Seeing that the rest of their force had been defeated, the Thebans formed up to break back through to their camp. Agesilaus met their force head on, and in the struggle that followed a number of Thebans were killed before the remainder were able to force their way through and rejoin their allies. After this victory, Agesilaus sailed with his army across the Gulf of Corinth and returned to Sparta.|$|E

5|$|During the Napoleonic Wars, the Caribbean Sea was {{initially}} an important theatre of naval conflict, as ships operating <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>various</b> French, British, Spanish and Dutch colonies preyed on enemy trade. During 1809 and 1810 however, the Royal Navy launched {{a series of}} co-ordinated amphibious operations that eliminated the French and Dutch colonies and brought {{the conflict in the}} Caribbean to an end. With the threat of attacks on British trade in the region significantly reduced, the Royal Navy correspondingly reduced their presence in the Caribbean and the remaining British ships were distributed to observe trouble spots in the region, which in 1812 included the independent nation of Haiti.|$|E
5|$|In April 2012, it was {{announced}} that the Nickelodeon Suites Resort in Orlando would be reviving Double Dare as a nightly live stage presentation, Double Dare Live. As part of the Studio Nick feature of the hotel, shows were performed each night exclusively for the resort's guests. The show featured elements and updates <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>various</b> versions of Double Dare, including remixed music, physical challenges and an obstacle course similar to the TV show. Like the most recent formats of the program, eight contestants were selected to participate for the game-playing teams, while additional audience members played other physical challenges throughout the program. Previews of Double Dare Live began on May 21, 2012, with an official launch date of May 25. The production continued until Nickelodeon Suites Resort Orlando rebranded as a Holiday Inn Resort on June 1, 2016. A scaled-down version of Double Dare Live, called Double Dare Challenge, was presented at Nickelodeon Universe in Mall of America from June 13 to September 24, 2016, and ran again from June 16 to September 30, 2017.|$|E
5|$|In late 1812, Alceste was {{decommissioned}} {{and placed}} in ordinary at Deptford. Between February and July 1814 she was converted at Deptford into a troopship; in this role, she was recommissioned in May 1814 under Commander Faniel Lawrence, and sailed with troops to North America. Following the British decision to attack New Orleans; Alceste left Pensacola on 8 December 1814, {{in tandem with the}} 50 other vessels under Vice-Admiral Alexander Cochrane. The point chosen to land the troops was at the head of Lake Borgne which was subsequently discovered to be guarded by five American gunboats, a sloop and a schooner. On 14 December, Cochrane dispatched nearly 1,000 men in 42 barges <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>various</b> ships under his command, including Alceste. After rowing for almost 24 hours, the British stopped just out of range to rest and eat breakfast before launching their attack. The conflict, known as the Battle of Lake Borgne, resulted in the capture of all the American vessels, at a cost of 94 British and 41 American dead and wounded.|$|E

5|$|Many {{details of}} Monitors history and {{insights}} of everyday crew life {{have been discovered}} from correspondence sent <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>various</b> crew members {{to family and friends}} while serving aboard the ironclad. In particular the correspondence of George S. Geer, who sent more than 80 letters, often referred to as The Monitor Chronicles, to his wife Martha during the entire time of Monitors service provide many details and insights into every chapter of the ironclad's short-lived history, offering a rare perspective of a sailor's experience on the naval front during the Civil War. The letters of Acting Paymaster William F. Keeler to his wife Anna also corroborate many of the accounts of affairs that took place aboard the Monitor. The letters of Geer and Keeler are available for viewing and are housed at the Mariners' Museum in Virginia. Other crew members were interviewed later in life, like Louis Stodder, one of the last crew members to abandon Monitor minutes before she sank in a storm at sea, who was the last surviving crew member of Monitor and lived well into the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Other leisure {{facilities}} include the Keelman's Way, a 14-mile designated cycle and walking route which stretches from Wylam station to Bill Quay and which passes along the riverbank at Felling Shore. Named from the keelboats used to transport coal <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>various</b> collieries in the area, the route was extended into Newburn in 2012 when a Gateshead blue plaque was laid {{in memory of}} its creator, Councillor Roy Deane. Also at Felling Shore, at Green Lane, is Friar's Goose marina and the adjacent Friar's Goose Water Sports Club, a privately owned and increasingly popular club predominantly attended by middle-aged patrons who undertake various activities such as sailing, yachting and angling on the River Tyne. Felling Cricket Club has been based at High Heworth Lane at Felling since 1961 and compete locally, {{and there are a}} wide selection of public houses, including the Wheatsheaf at Carlisle Street, the Blue Bell in Victoria Square, the Portland Arms at Split Crown Road and the Pear Tree Inn at Sunderland Road which are all locally listed as places of special local interest.|$|E
5|$|The Touchet Formation was {{originally}} identified at {{the confluence of}} the Touchet River with the Walla Walla River. It is also found at some distance up the Touchet River Valley. The number of layers observed decreases as one progresses up-valley, indicating that the floodwater lakes varied in depth and distance upstream <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>various</b> flood dams. Clastic dike intrusions are observed in some locations penetrating the layers vertically; the dikes are infilled with uniform-size fine-grained materials and are indications that the period between floods was long enough that the deposits dried, forming vertical cracks and allowing wind-blown eroded materials to infill the cracks.|$|E

5|$|The {{academic}} {{study of}} language is conducted within many different disciplinary areas and from different theoretical angles, {{all of which}} inform modern approaches to linguistics. For example, descriptive linguistics examines the grammar of single languages, theoretical linguistics develops theories {{on how best to}} conceptualize and define the nature of language based on data <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>various</b> extant human languages, sociolinguistics studies how languages are used for social purposes informing in turn the study of the social functions of language and grammatical description, neurolinguistics studies how language is processed in the human brain and allows the experimental testing of theories, computational linguistics builds on theoretical and descriptive linguistics to construct computational models of language often aimed at processing natural language or at testing linguistic hypotheses, and historical linguistics relies on grammatical and lexical descriptions of languages to trace their individual histories and reconstruct trees of language families by using the comparative method.|$|E
5|$|The museum {{contains}} information {{relating to}} the history of the site and some of the artefacts discovered during the excavations. These include carved coffin lids, medieval mosaic tiles, pottery, scribe's writing equipment and domestic items <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>various</b> buildings on the site such as buttons, combs and wig curlers. Two medieval skeletons recovered in the excavations are on display, including one showing signs of Paget's disease of bone. Standing in the museum is a reconstruction of the cloister arcade as it had been built following the fire of 1236. It consists of moulded pointed arches with springer blocks, voussoirs and apex stones, supported on triple shafts with foliate capitals and moulded bases. Above the capitals, at the bases of the arches, are sculptures that include depictions of human and animal heads. The human heads consist of two canons with hoods and protruding tonsures, other males, and females with shoulder-length hair. In one spandrel is a seated figure with an outstretched arm holding a book. Other carvings depict such subjects as fabulous beasts, and an otter or a snake.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{contributed to}} {{numerous}} weather-related traffic accidents, {{at least one}} of them classified as major. Around 20 collisions occurred on the night of August 19 across the San Francisco Peninsula. Two crashes on Interstate 80 forced the closure of four lanes for 30 minutes, while California State Route 9 was blocked in Saratoga by a large tree which fell due to saturated soil. It is unclear how many injuries resulted <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>various</b> incidents. Thunderstorms associated with the storm system left about 78,000 electric customers in Sonoma County without power after lightning struck a power substation. The outages lasted up to a few hours. Lightning also knocked three workers unconscious in a vineyard near Lodi; they were in good condition after hospitalization.|$|E
