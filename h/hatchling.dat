5|$|In Super Metroid, {{just after}} giving the <b>hatchling</b> to a Federation {{research}} station, Samus tracks the <b>hatchling</b> (stolen by Ridley) to a newly rebuilt Space Pirate base on Zebes. She travels deep underground, eventually finding the now-fully-grown Metroid, then battling a newly rebuilt {{and more powerful}} Mother Brain. The Metroid <b>hatchling</b> sacrifices itself to save Samus, and Samus in turn defeats Mother Brain and escapes as the entire planet is destroyed.|$|E
5|$|At birth, a {{rattlesnake}} <b>hatchling</b> {{has only a}} small button or 'primordial rattle' which is firmly attached {{to the tip of}} the tail. The first segment is added when the <b>hatchling</b> sheds its skin for the first time. A new section is added each time the skin is shed until a rattle is formed. The rattle grows as the snake ages but segments are also prone to breaking off and hence the length of a rattle is not a reliable indicator of the age of a snake.|$|E
5|$|Several {{juvenile}} Psittacosaurus {{have been}} found. The smallest is a P. mongoliensis <b>hatchling</b> conserved in the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), {{which is only}} 11 to 13centimetres (4–5inches) long, with a skull 2.8centimetres (1in) in length. Another <b>hatchling</b> skull at the AMNH is only 4.6centimetres (1.8inches) long. Both specimens are from Mongolia. Juveniles discovered in the Yixian Formation are approximately {{the same age as}} the larger AMNH specimen.|$|E
5|$|During routine {{maintenance}} work at Karori Sanctuary in late 2008, a tuatara nest was uncovered, with a <b>hatchling</b> found the following autumn. This {{is thought to}} be the first case of tuatara successfully breeding in the wild on the New Zealand mainland in over 200 years.|$|E
5|$|The recent {{discovery}} of a tuatara <b>hatchling</b> on the mainland indicates that attempts to re-establish a breeding population on the New Zealand mainland have had some success. The total population of tuatara {{is estimated to be}} greater than 60,000, but less than 100,000.|$|E
5|$|Psittacosaurus {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{completely}} known dinosaur genera. Fossils of hundreds of individuals have been collected so far, including many complete skeletons. Most age classes are represented, from <b>hatchling</b> through to adult, which has allowed several detailed studies of Psittacosaurus growth rates and reproductive biology. The abundance of this dinosaur in the fossil record has led to the labelling of Lower Cretaceous sediments of east Asia the Psittacosaurus biochron.|$|E
5|$|Along the way, {{she finds}} a Metroid egg that hatches in front of her. A Metroid <b>hatchling</b> floats out of the broken shell and {{imprints}} onto Samus, thinking that she is its mother. Unable to commit to her mission of extermination, Samus spares its life. She exits the tunnels while the Metroid helps clear the way. Reaching the planet's surface, Samus and the infant Metroid board the gunship together, setting the plot for Super Metroid.|$|E
5|$|Artificial {{lighting}} discourages nesting and {{interferes with}} the hatchlings' ability to navigate to the water's edge. Females prefer nesting on beaches free of artificial lighting. On developed beaches, nests are often clustered around tall buildings, perhaps because they block out the man-made light sources. Loggerhead hatchlings are drawn toward the brighter area over the water which is the consequence of the reflection of moon and star light. Confused by the brighter artificial light, they navigate inland, away from the protective waters, which exposes them to dehydration and predation as the sun rises. Artificial lighting causes {{tens of thousands of}} <b>hatchling</b> deaths per year.|$|E
5|$|The Virginia Aquarium & Marine Science Center (formerly the Virginia Marine Science Museum) is {{a popular}} {{aquarium}} near the oceanfront that features the 300,000-gallon Norfolk Canyon Aquarium, containing sand tiger, nurse and brown sharks, as well as sting rays and other large open-ocean dwellers. There is also a 70,000-gallon sea turtle aquarium, sea turtle <b>hatchling</b> laboratory, hands-on ocean exploration exhibits, jellyfish and octopus aquariums, and even a life-size model of a humpback whale. Other features include the Owls Creek salt marsh and a nature trail.|$|E
5|$|The loggerhead {{sea turtle}} is omnivorous, feeding mainly on bottom-dwelling invertebrates, such as gastropods, bivalves, and decapods. It has a greater list of known prey than any other sea turtle. Other food items include sponges, corals, sea pens, polychaete worms, sea anemones, cephalopods, barnacles, brachiopods, isopods, Portuguese men o' war, insects, bryozoans, sea urchins, sand dollars, sea cucumbers, starfish, fish (eggs, juveniles, and adults), <b>hatchling</b> turtles (including members of its own species), algae, and {{vascular}} plants. During migration through the open sea, loggerheads eat jellyfish, floating molluscs, floating egg clusters, squid, and flying fish.|$|E
5|$|American {{paddlefish}} are smooth-skinned {{and almost}} entirely cartilaginous. Their eyes {{are small and}} directed laterally. They have a large, tapering operculum flap, a large mouth, and a flat, paddle-shaped rostrum that measures approximately one-third of their body length. During {{the initial stages of}} development from embryo to <b>hatchling,</b> American paddlefish have no rostrum. It begins to form shortly after hatching. The rostrum is an extension of the cranium, not of the upper and lower jaws or olfactory system as with the long snouts of other fishes. Other distinguishing characteristics include a deeply forked heterocercal caudal fin and dull coloration, often with mottling, ranging from bluish gray to black dorsally grading to a whitish underbelly.|$|E
5|$|The near {{simultaneous}} {{appearance of}} nodosaurids in both North America and Europe {{is worthy of}} consideration, because at the time, they were separated from each other by a huge body of water. Europelta is the oldest nodosaurid from Europe; it {{is derived from the}} lower Albian Escucha Formation. The oldest western North American nodosaurid is Sauropelta, from the lower Albian Little Sheep Mudstone Member of the Cloverly Formation, at an age of 108.5±0.2million years. Eastern North American fossils seem older. Teeth of Priconodon crassus have been derived from the Arundel Clay of the Potomac Group of Maryland, which dates near the Aptian–Albian boundary. A Propanoplosaurus <b>hatchling</b> was uncovered {{from the base of the}} underlying Patuxent Formation, dated to the upper Aptian, making Propanoplosaurus the oldest nodosaurid.|$|E
5|$|A few Macroolithus eggs {{preserve}} embryonic {{remains of}} oviraptorids inside. Two eggs containing embryos {{found in the}} Upper Cretaceous Nanxiong Formation near Ganzhou, Jiangxi were referred to M. yaotunensis in 2008. One of these embryos shows a much greater degree of bone development (ossification) than the other; it preserves ossified hind limbs and several vertebrae. The fact that the cervical vertebrae not only have ossified centra and neural arches, but also have ossified zygapophyses, led Cheng et al. to conclude that this embryo may in fact represent a <b>hatchling,</b> since in modern chickens and skuas these zygaphyses are cartilaginous until hatching. Also, the embryo's foot anatomy (specifically, the proportions of its metatarsals) resembles that of the oviraptorid Heyuannia huangi, indicating that these eggs belong to H. huangi or a similar species. The other egg has a much less developed embryo, with only the hind limbs preserved. While this does not permit comparison on the species level, the tibia (shinbone) confirms {{that it is an}} oviraptorosaur.|$|E
5|$|Like all azhdarchid pterosaurs, Hatzegopteryx was {{probably}} a terrestrially foraging generalist predator. It is significantly larger than any other terrestrial predator from Maastrichtian Europe; due to its large size in an environment otherwise dominated by island dwarf dinosaurs, with no large hypercarnivorous theropods in the region, {{it has been suggested}} that Hatzegopteryx played the role of an apex predator in the Haţeg Island ecosystem. The robust anatomy of Hatzegopteryx suggests that it may have tackled larger prey than other azhdarchids, including animals too large to swallow whole; similarly, some modern storks (particularly the marabou stork and the jabiru) are known to attack and kill large prey such as flamingoes, and occasionally children, with their beaks. Meanwhile, other giant azhdarchids like Arambourgiania would probably have instead fed on small prey (up to the size of a human), including <b>hatchling</b> or small dinosaurs and eggs. Another pterosaur, Thalassodromeus, has similarly been suggested to be raptorial.|$|E
5|$|To {{support the}} lambeosaurine affinities of Eolambia, Kirkland {{conducted}} a phylogenetic analysis; the tree recovered by his analysis, which accordingly places Eolambia {{as the most}} basal lambeosaurine, is reproduced below. Despite the evidence he cited {{in support of this}} position, Kirkland also noted a seemingly inconsistent trait. As observed in the juvenile ilium he initially described, the antitrochanter – a projection on the ilium that limits the greater trochanter of the femur – is more poorly developed than would be expected for a basal hadrosaurid. Michael Brett-Surman noted that adults may have had a better-developed antitrochanter. On the other hand, the derived lambeosaurine Hypacrosaurus has a well-developed antitrochanter even at the <b>hatchling</b> stage. Kirkland noted the possibility that basal hadrosaurids developed their antitrochanter later in life than derived hadrosaurids such as Hypacrosaurus. He thus remarked that adult Eolambia specimens would resolve this issue.|$|E
5|$|Sandgrouse are monogamous. The {{breeding}} season usually coincides with {{a crop of}} seeds after the local rainy season and at this time, the feeding flocks tend to break up into pairs. The nesting site is a slight depression in the ground, sometimes lined with {{a few pieces of}} dry foliage. Most typically, three cryptic eggs are laid, though occasionally there may be two or four. Incubation duties are shared and in most species, the males incubate at night while the females sit on the eggs during the day. The eggs usually hatch after 20–25 days. The precocial chicks are covered with down and leave the nest as soon as the last <b>hatchling</b> has dried out. The parents do not provide them with food and they learn, with parental guidance, what is edible and what is not. The chicks obtain their water from the soaked downy feathers on the adults breasts. At first the chicks are too small and young to thermoregulate, and are provided with shade during the hottest part of the day and brooded at night. They remain with their parents, as a family group, for several months.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hatchling</b> {{birds of}} some species {{have a special}} kind of natal down {{feathers}} (neossoptiles) which are pushed out when the normal feathers (teleoptiles) emerge.|$|E
25|$|Dal Sasso & Maganuco {{have tried}} to {{determine}} the absolute age of the <b>hatchling.</b> The fact that the fontanelle had not closed yet, poses an upper age limit of about five weeks. An even lower limit is indicated {{by the lack of}} any tooth replacement, which with Archosauria begins after a few weeks at the latest. The most exact age is given {{by the size of the}} yolk sac, which indicates a probable age of three days, with an upper limit of a week. Despite its very young age, the <b>hatchling</b> was able to walk, as is shown by the complete ossification of the ilium. However, this does not imply Scipionyx was precocial as even with altricial birds this pelvis bone fully ossifies within a few days after hatching.|$|E
25|$|Greater rheas have a fluffy, tattered-looking plumage, that is gray or brown, {{with high}} {{individual}} variation, The head, neck, rump, and thighs are feathered. In general, males are darker than females. Even in the wildparticularly in Argentinaleucistic individuals (with white body plumage and blue eyes) {{as well as}} albinos occur. <b>Hatchling</b> greater rheas are grey with dark lengthwise stripes.|$|E
25|$|The {{body parts}} of the large lepidosaurian in the stomach had been made more {{digestible}} by biting them into pieces. According to Dal Sasso & Maganuco the <b>hatchling</b> would certainly have been incapable of achieving this and they considered it a strong indication of parental care as it was improbable the animal had by chance encountered a carcass neatly ripped apart into easily swallowed bits by predators or scavengers.|$|E
25|$|Misty and Annabelle {{investigate}} a monster problem in New York's Chinatown and ask Elsa Bloodstone for assistance. They {{discover that the}} Ghost Boys gang have been using Brood hatchlings to carry out hits in the neighborhood. Valkyrie, Misty and Elsa track a <b>hatchling</b> to an underground lair, where Hai Dai ninjas are bio-engineering Brood eggs. The three aided by No-Name of the Brood defeat the Hai Dai and their master, Zheng Bao Yu. Afterwards, Bao Yu turns to Caroline for protection.|$|E
25|$|The type {{specimen}} of Scansoriopteryx heilmanni (specimen number CAGS02-IG-gausa-1/DM 607) represents the fossilized {{remains of a}} <b>hatchling</b> maniraptoran dinosaur, {{similar in some ways}} to Archaeopteryx. A second specimen, the holotype of Epidendrosaurus ninchengensis (IVPP V12653), also shows features indicating it was a juvenile. The specimen is partially disarticulated, and most bones are preserved as impressions in the rock slab, rather than three-dimensional structures. Because the only known specimens are juvenile, the size of a full-grown Scansoriopteryx is unknownthe {{type specimen}} is a tiny, sparrow-sized creature.|$|E
25|$|Because the holotype is a <b>hatchling</b> {{of perhaps}} {{only a few}} days old, it is hard to {{determine}} the build of the adult animal but some general conclusions can be reliably made. Scipionyx was a small bipedal predator. Its horizontal rump was balanced by a long tail. The neck was relatively long and slender. The hindlimbs and especially the forelimbs were rather elongated. Dal Sasso & Maganuco considered it likely that a coat of primitive protofeathers was present, as these are also known from some direct relatives.|$|E
25|$|In a 2001 {{review of}} hadrosaur eggshell and <b>hatchling</b> {{material}} from Alberta's Dinosaur Park Formation, Darren Tanke and M. K. Brett-Surman concluded that hadrosaurs nested {{in both the}} ancient upland and lowlands of the formation's depositional environment. The upland nesting grounds may have been preferred by the less common hadrosaurs, like Brachylophosaurus and Parasaurolophus. However, the authors were unable to determine what specific factors shaped nesting ground choice in the formation's hadrosaurs. They suggested that behavior, diet, soil condition, and competition between dinosaur species all potentially influenced where hadrosaurs nested.|$|E
25|$|Another method {{targeting}} the snail host, mechanical disturbance of snail habitat, has been also tried {{in some areas}} of North America and Lake Annecy in France, with promising results. Some work in Michigan suggests that administering praziquantel to <b>hatchling</b> waterfowl can reduce local swimmer's itch rates in humans. Work on schistosomiasis showed that water-resistant topical applications of the common insect repellent DEET prevented schistosomes from penetrating the skin of mice. Public education of risk factors, a good alternative to the aforementioned interventionist strategies, can also reduce human exposure to cercariae.|$|E
25|$|The holotype of Scipionyx {{represents}} {{a very small}} individual, the preserved length being just 237 millimetres. In 2011 dal Sasso & Maganuco estimated its total length, including the missing tail section, at 461 millimetres. The specimen was not much smaller than known embryos or hatchlings of Lourinhasaurus and Allosaurus, theropods of considerable magnitude. However, given its affinities with the Compsognathidae, {{it is likely that}} the adult size of Scipionyx did not surpass that of the largest known compsognathid, Sinocalliopteryx of 237 centimetres length. As the <b>hatchling</b> would have fitted within an egg about eleven centimetres long and six centimetres wide, this would have implied a rather high egg size compared to the adult body length.|$|E
25|$|The {{food items}} found allow to {{reconstruct}} {{a sequence of}} food intakes: first a four to five centimetres long fish; secondly a smaller fish of two to three centimetres; next a ten to twelve centimetres long lizard; then a fifteen to forty, depending on the identification, centimetres long lepidosaurian lizard; and finally some indeterminate vertebrate(s). Together they represent a varied diet showing that Scipionyx was an opportunistic generalist. That swift lizards had been caught and sea fish washed ashore had been gathered necessitating a prolonged patrolling of the flood line, both indicate a good mobility. If the prey animal in the stomach really was forty centimetres long, {{it is highly unlikely}} that the equally-sized <b>hatchling</b> had been able to subdue it, indicating parental care.|$|E
25|$|Varricchio et al. {{also found}} {{evidence}} for iterative laying, where the adult might lay {{a pair of}} eggs every one or two days, and then ensured simultaneous hatching by delaying brooding until all eggs were laid. MOR 363 was found with 22 empty (hatched) eggs, and the embryos found in the eggs of MOR 246 were in very similar states of development, implying {{that all of the}} young hatched simultaneously. The embryos had an advanced degree of skeletal development, implying that they were precocial or even superprecocial. The authors estimated 45 to 65 total days of adult nest attendance for laying, brooding, and hatching. The authors found no evidence that the young remained in the nest after hatching and suggested that they dispersed like <b>hatchling</b> crocodiles or megapode birds instead.|$|E
25|$|In {{describing}} Scansoriopteryx, Czerkas & Yuan cited {{evidence for}} an arboreal (tree-dwelling) lifestyle. They noted that, unlike all modern bird hatchlings, the forelimbs of Scansoriopteryx are {{longer than the}} hind limbs. The authors argued that this anomaly indicates the forelimbs {{played an important role}} in locomotion even at an extremely early developmental stage. Scansoriopteryx has a well-preserved foot, and the authors interpreted the hallux as reversed, the condition of a backward-pointing toe being widespread among modern tree-dwelling birds. Furthermore, the authors pointed to the short, stiffened tail of the Scansoriopteryx specimen as a tree-climbing adaptation. The tail may have been used as a prop, much like the tails of modern woodpeckers. Comparison with the hands of modern climbing species with elongated third digits, like iguanid lizards, also supports the tree-climbing hypothesis. Indeed, the hands of Scansoriopteryx are much better adapted to climbing than the modern tree-climbing <b>hatchling</b> of the hoatzin.|$|E
25|$|The {{vertebral}} column of Scipionyx probably includes ten cervical vertebrae and thirteen dorsal vertebrae; {{due to the}} fact the specimen is just a <b>hatchling,</b> the differentiation between the two categories has not fully developed, making any distinction rather arbitrary. With certainty five sacral vertebrae are present. The fossil has preserved just nine tail vertebrae; likely fifty or more had been originally present. The neck vertebrae are opisthocoelous. The axis is pneumatised as a pneumatopore, an opening through which a diverticulum of the air sack of the neck base could reach its hollow interior, is visible on its side. The third, fourth and fifth vertebrae also show pneumatopores but the consecutive series lacks them, which is surprising as it had been assumed the pneumatisation process would have started at the back, working itself forward. Contrary to what was stated by the 1998 study, the cervical ribs are very elongated, with a length of up to three vertebral centra.|$|E
25|$|The {{bones in}} the stomach region had not been etched by the stomach acid, {{indicating}} this meal {{was less than a}} day old. It is possible that the stomach exit was too narrow to let these remains pass and that the acid was used to extract calcium from the bones, a much-needed nutrient for a young growing animal. The subsequent digestive tract with most extant vertebrates is incapable of further digesting bones. Afterwards the remains would then have been regurgitated. However, the presence of vertebrae in the intestines suggests that the exit was wide and that non-avian theropods in this respect were more like present Lepidosauromorpha than extant Archosauria who regurgitate. This is also confirmed by a high bone content in the coprolites of large theropods. Fish contains much calcium and {{it is possible that the}} <b>hatchling</b> instinctively sought it out; alternatively, it could have been preferentially fed fish by its parents. The presence of skin in the faeces was to be expected as this is not easily digested.|$|E
25|$|The {{first book}} in the series started with the attack on Arya (an elf) who was {{carrying}} a dragon's egg, by Durza(a shade), a servant of Galbatorix. Only two other Dragon eggs remain in the citadel in Ilirea, which had been renamed Urû'baen by Galbatorix. Arya attempted to send the egg to Brom, but the remaining Eldunarí altered the spell making the egg go to Eragon, because {{they believed that the}} egg might hatch for him (revealed in the final book), who finds the egg while on a hunting trip. A few days later, the egg hatches and Eragon touches it, giving him a silver mark on his palm and making Eragon a Dragon Rider through their bond. The <b>hatchling</b> chooses the name Saphira from a list of dragon names Eragon reads to her. Eragon's cousin, Roran, leaves for a job to earn money so he can start a family with his beloved, Katrina. His uncle, Garrow, is killed by King Galbatorix's servants, the Ra'zac, and Eragon flees Carvahall with Brom to hunt down the Ra'zac, unaware that Brom is his father. Brom gives Morzan's sword, Zar'roc, to Eragon.|$|E
