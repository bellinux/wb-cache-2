Acknowledging the harm caused to nature by humans, the Advisory Board asked {{for the implementation of}} [...] "a set of ecologic skills unknown in this country today". A call to arms was raised for exploring new methods of active protection and restoration of plant and animal life in the national parks: [...] "Americans have shown a great capacity for degrading and fragmenting native biotas. So <b>far</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> not exercised much imagination or ingenuity in rebuilding damaged biotas. It will not be done by passive protection alone." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Hezbollah leader, Nasrallah, said in {{his third}} {{televised}} speech since the conflict began that [...] "In the beginning, we started to act calmly, we focused on Israel military bases and we didn't attack any settlement, Hizbullah militants had destroyed military bases, while the Israelis killed civilians and targeted Lebanon's infrastructure."

2500|$|Hugo Gernsback's New York City {{radio station}} began a regular, if limited, {{schedule}} of live television broadcasts on August 14, 1928, using 48-line images. Working {{with only one}} transmitter, the station alternated radio broadcasts with silent television images of the station's call sign, faces in motion, and wind-up toys in motion. Speaking later that month, Gernsback downplayed the broadcasts, intended for amateur experimenters. [...] "In six months we may have television for the public, but so <b>far</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> not got it."

As security guards, Pete said [...] "we ain't into that security", but that they agreed after the beer offer. He also claimed that, other than being told to [...] "just keep people off the stage", Cutler gave the Hells Angels very little specific instructions for stage security: [...] "They didn't say nothing to us about any of that." [...] And although the Angels are not security guards, [...] "If we say we're going to do something, we do it. If we decide to do it, it's done.

2500|$|Asteroid mining {{has also}} been seriously considered. A NASA design study {{evaluated}} a 10,000 ton mining vehicle (to be assembled in orbit) that would return a 500,000 ton asteroid fragment to geostationary orbit. Only about 3,000 tons of the mining ship would be traditional aerospace-grade payload. The rest would be reaction mass for the mass-driver engine, which could be arranged to be the spent rocket stages used to launch the payload. Assuming that 100% of the returned asteroid was useful, and that the asteroid miner itself couldn't be reused, that represents nearly a 95% reduction in launch costs. However, the true merits of such a method would depend on a thorough mineral survey of the candidate asteroids; thus <b>far,</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> only estimates of their composition. One proposal is to capture the asteroid Apophis into earth orbit and convert it into 150 solar power satellites of 5 GW each or the larger asteroid 1999 AN10 [...] which is 50x the size of [...] Apophis and large enough to build 7,500 5-Gigawatt Solar Power Satellites ...|$|E

Rae joined the Liberal Party in April 2006 (he had previously been a Liberal in the 1960s) before launching a centrist campaign that month.

2500|$|So <b>far</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> spoken only of {{the office}} of Prime {{properly}} so called, which ends like the other Little Hours. It is followed by some prayers which are called the office of the chapter, and are composed in the Roman Liturgy of the reading of the martyrology, of a prayer, [...] "Sancta Maria et omnes sancti" [...] ("May holy Mary and all the Saints..."), a prayer concerning work, [...] "Respice in servos tuos [...] [...] [...] Dirigere et sanctificare" [...] ("Look upon thy servants... Direct and sanctify"), and a blessing. This addition to Prime is a legacy bequeathed by the monks to the secular clergy. As has been said above, originally after Prime the monks had to betake themselves to manual work or reading. The office therefore ended with a prayer for their work [...] "... et opera manuum nostrarum dirige super nos et opus manuum nostrarum dirige" [...] ("...and direct thou the works of our hands over us; yea, the work of our hands do thou direct."), and the prayer [...] "Dirigere". Later the reading of the martyrology, the necrology, the rule, and a prayer for the dead were added.|$|E
