5|$|The Canadiens {{entered the}} 1980s <b>in</b> <b>transition,</b> as Dryden, Lemaire and team captain Yvan Cournoyer {{announced}} their retirements in 1979, and Serge Savard followed suit in 1981. A trade during the 1982–83 season sent Rod Langway and Doug Jarvis to the Washington Capitals. Among their replacements were Swedish star Mats Naslund and forward Guy Carbonneau. Bob Gainey {{was appointed by}} the club to succeed Savard as team captain. Guy Lafleur remained the team's offensive star, recording his 1,000th career point in 1981 in just 720 games, the fastest anyone had reached that milestone in NHL history, and a record that stood until broken by Wayne Gretzky in 1984.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{scientific}} themes mark the play's position {{at a major}} turning-point in Verne's ideology.

The play, by exploring science in both positive and negative lights, shows Verne <b>in</b> <b>transition</b> between the two points of view.|$|E

5|$|When Parseghian {{arrived at}} Northwestern, its {{football}} program was <b>in</b> <b>transition.</b> Bob Voigts had quit {{as head coach}} in February 1955, leaving his assistant Lou Saban to guide the team. Under Saban, a former Browns teammate of Parseghian's, Northwestern finished at 0–8–1, the worst-ever record in its history at the time. Ted Payseur, the school's athletic director, resigned after the season under pressure from alumni {{and was replaced by}} Stu Holcomb. One of Holcomb's first moves was to fire Saban and replace him with Parseghian.|$|E
5|$|GA is {{regulated}} by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), although regulatory powers are being increasingly transferred to the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). The main focus is on standards of airworthiness and pilot licensing, and {{the objective is to}} promote high standards of safety. At the lighter end of the GA spectrum some regulatory authority is devolved to representative bodies, and gliding is <b>in</b> <b>transition</b> from a self-regulatory model to more formal governance by EASA. Airspace regulation necessary to protect an increasing number of CAT operations has reduced the area in which GA flights can be freely conducted. The growth in CAT is also making access to larger airports more difficult for the GA sector, and smaller aerodromes are vulnerable to closure and re-development for more profitable uses. The UK planning system has no remit to consider the national significance of GA public transport operations, and generally does not favour the development of smaller aerodromes catering to the GA market. The planning process has become a mechanism for addressing local aerodrome-related environmental issues which, particularly regarding noise, are the main subjects of public criticism levelled at GA.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, he was {{inspired}} to write music again {{after the birth of}} his first child, Michael, with fellow R singer and then-girlfriend Angie Stone. He also traveled back to the South, spending time in South Carolina and in his hometown of Richmond, Virginia, while reconnecting himself with the African-American musical history that had originally inspired him. Shortly after his son's birth and the release of his first live album Live at the Jazz Cafe (1998) through EMI Records, he began preparation for the recording of songs for Voodoo. In several interviews after its release, he cited his son's birth as an inspirational source and creative muse for him. A dedication to his son Michael and daughter Imani was included in the album's liner notes, which were co-written by D'Angelo and writer/musician Saul Williams. In a press video accompanying the release of Voodoo, D'Angelo suggested that he was attempting to create a new sound for him that was <b>in</b> <b>transition.</b>|$|E

5|$|Lōʻihi is {{following}} the pattern of development that is characteristic of all Hawaiʻian volcanoes. Geochemical evidence from Lōʻihi lavas indicates that Lōʻihi is <b>in</b> <b>transition</b> between the preshield and shield volcano stage, providing valuable clues to the early development of Hawaiian volcanoes. In the preshield stage, Hawaiian volcanoes have steeper sides and {{a lower level of}} activity, producing an alkali basalt lava. Continued volcanism is expected to eventually create an island at Lōʻihi. Lōʻihi experiences frequent landslides; the growth of the volcano has destabilized its slopes, and extensive areas of debris inhabit the steep southeastern face. Similar deposits from other Hawaiian volcanoes indicate that landslide debris is an important product of the early development of Hawaiian volcanoes. Lōʻihi is predicted to rise above the surface in 10,000 to 100,000 years.|$|E
5|$|The British Empire {{had been}} <b>in</b> <b>transition</b> since the 1920s, {{and the pace}} {{accelerated}} {{in the wake of}} the Second World War. More and more member states demanded independence, and a series of crises erupted during the 1950s, including the 1952 Mau Mau Uprising in Kenya and the Suez Crisis of 1956. During the same period immigration into Britain from the Indian subcontinent and the Caribbean was on the increase, causing some resentment among elements of the native population. At the time Kneale was working on his scripts black communities in Nottingham and London came under attack from mobs of white Britons; Kneale became keen to develop the serial as an allegory for the emerging racial tensions that culminated in the Notting Hill race riots of August and September 1958.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} settlements date {{to around}} AD700. Aalborg's {{position at the}} narrowest point on the Limfjord made it an important harbour during the Middle Ages, and later a large industrial centre.

Budolfi Church, now a cathedral, dates {{from the end of the}} 14th century and Aalborghus Castle, a royal residence, was built in 1550. Today, Aalborg is a city <b>in</b> <b>transition</b> from a working-class industrial area to a knowledge-based community. A major exporter of grain, cement, and spirits, its thriving business interests include Siemens Wind Power, Aalborg Industries, and Aalborg Portland. These companies have become global producers of wind turbine rotors, marine boilers and cement.|$|E

5|$|The economic, {{social and}} {{cultural}} dislocation of ordinary people, the economic hardship of an economy <b>in</b> <b>transition,</b> and the pressures of meteorological disasters all contributed to growing problems in Central Europe. The failure {{of most of the}} governments to deal with the food crisis of the mid-1840s, caused by the potato blight (related to the Great Irish Famine) and several seasons of bad weather, encouraged many to think that the rich and powerful had no interest in their problems. Those in authority were concerned about the growing unrest, political and social agitation among the working classes, and the disaffection of the intelligentsia. No amount of censorship, fines, imprisonment, or banishment, it seemed, could stem the criticism. Furthermore, it was becoming increasingly clear that both Austria and Prussia wanted to be the leaders in any resulting unification; each would inhibit the drive of the other to achieve unification.|$|E
5|$|The first {{buildings}} were {{completed in the}} Gothic style, including the church. The refectory (dining hall) shows an architectural style <b>in</b> <b>transition</b> between earlier Romanesque and contemporary Gothic. A fine High Gothic chapter house was built of best quality hard limestone. The church was rebuilt sometime before 1650 in a late Gothic style with a prominent vaulted ceiling. The cloister was rebuilt around 1617, and is of a simple design with little adornment surrounding a High Renaissance arcade. The final phase of building took place around 1650, with a new doorway for the church, completed in late Renaissance and Plateresque style full of detail. Because of its prosperity and the multiple expansion projects, Santa María de Óvila exhibited examples of every Spanish religious architectural style used from 1200 to 1600. However, even at its height, Óvila remained {{one of the smallest}} Cistercian monasteries in the region of Castile.|$|E

40|$|Building on {{register}} data describing monthly {{labour market}} status {{for the whole}} Norwegian population 1992 - 95, we estimate grouped competing risk hazard rate models for transitions between employment, unemployment and non-participation. The models impose no parametric restrictions on either calendar time- or spell duration effects. There is a substantial business cycle element <b>in</b> all <b>transition</b> rates apart from transitions from employment to non-participation. Conditioned on observed covariates, {{there is a strong}} negative duration dependence <b>in</b> <b>transitions</b> from unemployment to employment. Economic incentives play an important role <b>in</b> <b>transitions</b> from unemployment to employment, as well as <b>in</b> <b>transitions</b> from employment to nonparticipation. A 10 per cent increase in the unemployment benefit replacement ratio reduces the transition rate from unemployment to employment with 4 - 7 per cent, while it reduces the transition rate from unemployment to non-participation with 10 - 13 per cent. Access to a particularly generous voluntary early retirement scheme increases the hazard rate from employment to non-participation with 40 - 80 per cent. More human capital entails higher job-to-job transition rates and lower transition rates to unemployment and non-participation. It is also associated with higher transition rates from unemployment to employment...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the determinants of bank profitability <b>in</b> the early <b>transition</b> countries of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), and <b>in</b> the late <b>transition</b> countries of the former USSR. We apply a GMM technique for the period covering 2000 – 2013. The results show that profitability persists and the determinants of bank profitability vary across transition countries. Particularly, the banking sector of early transition countries is more competitive. However, the impact of credit risk on bank profitability is positive <b>in</b> early <b>transition</b> countries, but negative <b>in</b> late <b>transition</b> countries. Government spending and monetary freedom negatively influence bank profitability only <b>in</b> late <b>transition</b> countries. Moreover, better capitalised banks are more profitable <b>in</b> early <b>transition</b> countries implying that these banking sectors are more robust. A range of possible approaches that governments can take to further develop banking sectors are discussed...|$|R
