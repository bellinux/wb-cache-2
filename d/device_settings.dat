25|$|Siri {{features}} a new design where the assistant fades {{in with the}} background app being blurred. While speaking, visual vocal waves appear, that form into a spinning circle as the device communicates with Apple's servers. Siri can now control a limited set of <b>device</b> <b>settings,</b> including Bluetooth. The assistant can alternatively send the user directly to the settings menu if their query cannot be controlled by voice, or otherwise, displays an error if the request can't be processed. For searching the Internet, Bing became the default search engine, and Siri's web resources were expanded to include Wikipedia. Siri was also more deeply connected into Twitter, offering full tweet search.|$|E
500|$|As {{with all}} {{previous}} generations of iPhone and iPad hardware, {{there are four}} buttons and one switch on the fourth-generation iPad. [...] With the device in its portrait orientation, these are: a [...] "home" [...] button {{on the face of}} the device under the display that returns the user to the home screen, a wake/sleep button on the top edge of the device, and two buttons on the upper right side of the device performing volume up/down functions, under which is a switch whose function varies according to <b>device</b> <b>settings,</b> generally functioning either to switch the device into or out of silent mode or to lock/unlock the orientation of the screen. Externally, the fourth-generation iPad is identical to its predecessor apart from the differences between dock connectors used and change of manufacturers that produce the display. In addition, the Wi-Fi only version weighs 652 grams while the cellular model weighs 662 grams– 2 grams heavier than their respective predecessors. The display responds to other sensors: an ambient light sensor to adjust screen brightness and a 3-axis accelerometer to sense orientation and switch between portrait and landscape modes. Unlike the iPhone and iPod Touch's built-in applications, which work in three orientations (portrait, landscape-left and landscape-right), the iPad's built-in applications support screen rotation in all four orientations, including upside-down. Consequently, the device has no intrinsic [...] "native" [...] orientation; only the relative position of the home button changes.|$|E

40|$|This {{introduction}} {{provides an}} overview of material- or device-centered approaches to the study of public participation, and articulates the theoretical contributions of the four articles that make up this special section. Set against the background of post-Foucaldian perspectives on the material dimensions of citizenship and engagement - perspectives that treat matter as a tacit, constituting force in the organization of collectives and are predominantly concerned with the fabrication of political subjects - we outline an approach that considers material engagement as a distinct mode of performing the public. The question, then, is how objects, <b>devices,</b> <b>settings</b> and materials acquire explicit political capacities, and how they serve to enact material participation as a specific public form. We discuss the connections between social studies of material participation and political theory, and define the contours of an empiricist approach to material publics, one that takes as its central cue that the values and criteria particular to these publics emerge as {{part of the process of}} their organization. Finally, we discuss four themes that connect the articles in this special section, namely their focus on 1) mundane technologies, 2) experimental <b>devices</b> and <b>settings</b> for material participation; 3) the dynamic of effort and comfort, and 4) the modes of containment and proliferation that characterize material publics...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a functionally reduced WWW server {{based on an}} 8051 microcontroller. The web server can be embedded in a device and used to remotely, over the Internet, inspect and/or control its state.

Viewing the page with any popular browser, the user can change the <b>device’s</b> <b>settings</b> and submit another HTTP request. Having received it, the web server will make the changes requested by the user. The server software is functionally limited and aimed at minimal memory requirements. Therefore, a somewhat simplified version of the TCP and IP protocols has been implemented. Nevertheless, the server reliably responds to requests generated by a number of popular web browsers running on a remote host. 1...|$|R

40|$|Confidentiality {{is a most}} {{significant}} and least understood security issue in cyber-physical systems. Many aspects of the system can jeopardize confidentiality. A great deal of research and effort is spent in integrity and confidentiality through authentication and encryption. However, even with the authentication mechanism working properly, the system's confidential information can be breached through unrestricted information flow or other implicit deducible information channels at the cyber-physical boundary. This paper conducts an information flow analysis using security models of confidentiality {{at different levels of}} the advanced electric power grid using cooperating FACTS devices. Taking only the FACTS <b>device's</b> <b>settings</b> and control operations as confidential information, even if the information flow satisfies certain security models, confidential information may still be deducible by observation or inference. The information flow analysis in this paper raises awareness that authentication itself is not enough to protect the confidentiality of a cyber-physical system. The analysis of the architecture of FACTS power system can be extended to many other cyber-physical systems...|$|R
