In 1945, he received a letter from Dean Mark Ingraham of the College of Letters and Science requesting his return to the university to teach in the coming academic year. His appointment was not extended when he did not commit to returning. In a talk given there several years later, Feynman quipped, [...] "It's great to be back at the only university that ever <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> to fire me." ...|$|E
500|$|During an {{interview}} with entertainment website Digital Spy Dennis discussed Paul's later relationships in depth. Paul's relationship with Lyn Scully (Janet Andrewartha) was short lived, he mistreated her but ultimately in a twist for the character, he did the right thing. Dennis describes this as: [...] "The Lyn story was quite sincere, but he <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> {{on the day of}} the wedding to tell her that he was no good. So he obviously cared about Lyn, but then she came back and haunted him." [...] His relationship with Rebecca Napier (Jane Hall) at times can be fiery, of this Dennis said: [...] "I want to see Paul and Rebecca be like Angie and Dirty Den. I think Rebecca is capable of that. She plays a fiery character and is a very strong. Paul needs somebody who is absolutely there for him and adores him, but will take no shit from him and stand up and fight as hard as she does." ...|$|E

500|$|Varietys Cynthia Littleton [...] "loved seeing Bernard in Grizzly Adams mode" [...] in {{the season}} five finale, while Ryan McGee from Zap2it {{compared}} Bernard's appearance to both Moses and the Gorton's Fisherman. McGee said [...] "It’s a gorgeous, gorgeous scene, even if it stands as a meta-criticism of the angst and turmoil of the show’s major characters". Alan Sepinwall from The Star-Ledger called it [...] "one of the best, most moving scenes of the finale". Noel Murray from The A.V. Club thought the scene was useful as it allowed the characters to leave the show, but also it caused him to question whether opting out was the right or wrong thing to do. The Huffington Post's Jay Glatfelter thought their decision not to participate [...] "all but solidified them as the 'Adam and Eve' [...] from the caves", although this was shown {{not to be the}} case in season six. Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune listed the pair amongst her favourite characters of the series, commenting [...] "Few things made [...] happier than seeing them comfortably ensconced in their retirement cabin with Walt's dog, Vincent. They <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> to give up the whole island rat race, and their optimistic, straightforward attitudes and down-to-earth humor grounded Lost and gave us a window into normalcy, which, goodness knows, we needed sometimes".|$|E

60|$|And now, my friends, {{if any of}} you {{are tempted}} to follow Jacob's example, take warning betimes. You will be tempted.

They had spontaneous humor, sentiment, a fluent and admirable technic.sic <b>The</b> idiom <b>has</b> enough modern pepper in it to constantly stimulate the ear; but the music is not forced, {{any more than it}} is portentous. A young composer of talent disported himself in these pieces, and his audience was duly grateful.

50|$|The {{simplest}} {{sort code}} and thereby impossible to break.

60|$|She accordingly, it is said, {{attempted}} to induce Menesius {{to alter the}} arrangements which he had made for Peter, so as to release him from restraint, and allow him to do as he pleased.
