5|$|During this period, Copeland {{received}} {{far more}} personal {{attention from the}} Bradley family than her mother could <b>give</b> <b>each</b> of her six children. Raised in a lapsed Christian household, when Copeland lived with the Bradley family, she attended their synagogue and celebrated Shabbat with them, enjoying their family's closeness. In addition to Bradley's intensive ballet training, her husband, a modern-dance teacher, served as Copeland's pas-de-deux instructor and partner. The summer before her fifteenth birthday, Bradley began to homeschool Copeland for 10th grade to free up more time for dance. At fifteen years old, Copeland won {{first place in the}} Los Angeles Music Center Spotlight Awards at the Chandler Pavilion in March 1998. Copeland said {{it was the first time}} she ever battled nervousness. The winners received scholarships between $500 and $2500. Copeland's victory in the 10th annual contest among gifted high school students in Southern California secured her recognition by the Los Angeles Times as the best young dancer in the Greater Los Angeles Area.|$|E
5|$|It {{was in the}} Kabaty Woods, at Pyry, on 25 and 26 July 1939 {{with war}} looming that, on {{instructions}} from the Polish General Staff, the Cipher Bureau's chiefs, Lt. Col. Gwido Langer and Major Maksymilian Ciężki, the three civilian mathematician-cryptologists, and Col. Stefan Mayer, chief of intelligence, revealed Poland's achievements to cryptanalytical representatives of France and Britain, explaining how they had broken Enigma. They undertook to <b>give</b> <b>each</b> country a Polish-reconstructed Enigma, along with details of their equipment, including Zygalski sheets and Rejewski's cryptologic bomb. In return, the British pledged to prepare two full sets of Zygalski sheets for all 60 possible wheel orders. The French contingent consisted of Major Gustave Bertrand, the French radio-intelligence and cryptology chief, and Capt. Henri Braquenié of the French Air Force staff. The British sent Commander Alastair Denniston, head of Britain's Government Code and Cypher School, Dilly Knox, chief British cryptanalyst and Commander Humphrey Sandwith, head of the Royal Navy's intercept and direction-finding stations.|$|E
5|$|The Danish {{scientist}} Nicolas Steno (1669) pioneered experimental {{investigations of}} crystal symmetry. Steno {{showed that the}} angles between the faces are the same in every exemplar of {{a particular type of}} crystal, and René Just Haüy (1784) discovered that every face of a crystal can be described by simple stacking patterns of blocks of the same shape and size. Hence, William Hallowes Miller in 1839 was able to <b>give</b> <b>each</b> face a unique label of three small integers, the Miller indices which remain in use today for identifying crystal faces. Haüy's study led to the correct idea that crystals are a regular three-dimensional array (a Bravais lattice) of atoms and molecules; a single unit cell is repeated indefinitely along three principal directions that are not necessarily perpendicular. In the 19th century, a complete catalog of the possible symmetries of a crystal was worked out by Johan Hessel, Auguste Bravais, Evgraf Fedorov, Arthur Schönflies and (belatedly) William Barlow (1894). From the available data and physical reasoning, Barlow proposed several crystal structures in the 1880s that were validated later by X-ray crystallography; however, the available data were too scarce in the 1880s to accept his models as conclusive.|$|E

5|$|To <b>give</b> <b>each</b> world a theme, {{they were}} each {{designed}} {{with a particular}} gameplay element in mind. This approach created a structure where players would be introduced to new gameplay mechanics frequently. The intention {{was to keep the}} game engaging and continually expand the depth of gameplay as players progressed through the game. The first stage of each world is designed to be a simple puzzle that teaches players the new mechanic. Initially, the development team were creating large stages that would take a fairly long time to complete. However, they later decided that players should be able to complete them quicker, and thus the level structure was changed and the amount of content per stage was reduced. Story elements were also added to encourage players to keep playing. Creating an intuitive and easy control scheme was an important factor as the development team wanted to ensure that the action of creating boxes was comfortable and fun. The development team had considered implementing a multiplayer mode for BoxBoy!. Utimately, the feature was excluded as they believed that making a fun single-player experience should be the priority.|$|E
5|$|Under manager George Scherger, the Sounds {{started the}} 1979 season poorly, before {{rallying}} to win 20 of 31games in late May and June. They entered {{the last day}} of the first half of the season in first place, but lost their game to cross-state rivals the Memphis Chicks and finished in second place. The Sounds and Chicks met again on {{the last day of}} the second half in a split doubleheader; both games were won by Nashville. The two teams then faced-off in a best-of-three series to determine the Western Division champion. The Sounds won the series, two games to one, before advancing to the Southern League championship series against the Columbus Astros. Nashville captured their first Southern League championship by defeating the Astros, three games to one. Schmittou wanted to <b>give</b> <b>each</b> player a $1,000 bonus for winning the pennant, but as that would have been against the National Association's rules, he settled for buying them championship rings instead. Geoff Combe, with a league-leading 27saves, won the league's Most Outstanding Pitcher Award. The Sounds compiled an 83–61 record that season. During the All-Star Break between the halves of the season, Nashville played host to the Southern League All-Star Game. The contest pitted a team of the league's All-Stars against the major league Atlanta Braves. The All-Stars defeated the Braves, five to two. Nashville's Duane Walker was named the game's MVP.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} the classic problem of envy-free division of a heterogeneous good ("cake") among several agents. It is known that, when the allotted pieces must be connected, the problem cannot {{be solved by}} a finite algorithm for 3 or more agents. Even when the pieces may be disconnected, no bounded-time algorithm is known for 5 or more agents. The impossibility result, however, assumes that the entire cake must be allocated. In this paper we replace the entire-allocation requirement with a weaker partial-proportionality requirement: the piece <b>given</b> to <b>each</b> agent must be worth for it at least a certain positive fraction of the entire cake value. We prove that {{this version of the}} problem is solvable in bounded time even when the pieces must be connected. We present bounded-time envy-free cake-cutting algorithms for: (1) <b>giving</b> <b>each</b> of n agents a connected piece with a positive value; (2) <b>giving</b> <b>each</b> of 3 agents a connected piece worth at least 1 / 3; (3) <b>giving</b> <b>each</b> of 4 agents a connected piece worth at least 1 / 7; (4) <b>giving</b> <b>each</b> of 4 agents a disconnected piece worth at least 1 / 4; (5) <b>giving</b> <b>each</b> of n agents a disconnected piece worth at least (1 -ϵ) /n for any positive ϵ.
