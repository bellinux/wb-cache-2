40|$|Overview: Inflammatory Breast Cancer (IBC) is a {{rare and}} very {{aggressive}} type of cancer that tends to develop at a younger age, compared with other subtypes of breast cancer. Because a distinct lump may not be noticeable, correct diagnosis takes longer and, therefore, successful treatment may hinder a patient’s prognostics. This study aims to conduct a systematic review of research articles on IBC. Methods: This is a systematic review of studies in the PubMed database to April 2013, which fit the <b>eligibility</b> <b>criterion</b> of “Inflammatory Breast Neoplasms ” (MeSH Terms), filtered by Languages (English OR Portuguese OR Spanish). Findings: Of the 119 studies identified, 25 complied with the <b>eligibility</b> <b>criterion</b> for the disease, diagnostics, treatment and prognostics. Conclusion: Despite methodological differences, findings evidence that although IBC presents particular features (lower survival rate and worse prognostics than most types of breast cancer), very few studies examine its epidemiology and specific risk factors in depth and use any other therapeutic approaches than those commonly used for other breast cancer subtypes. Therefore, further investigation of the disease’s aggressiveness is still necessary. Key words: inflammatory breast neoplasms, medical oncology...|$|R
