OBJETIVO: Demonstrar a casuística e avaliar os resultados e complicações com a técnica de FE no Serviço de Otorrinolaringologia da Universidade Federal de Uberlândia. PACIENTES E MÉTODOS: De janeiro de 2001 a janeiro de 2004, 67 pacientes foram submetidos à FE, sendo que 7 à "técnica dos triângulos". As idades variaram entre 38 a 59 anos (média de 48, 3 anos), sendo 65 (97 %) do sexo feminino. RESULTADOS: Destes, 56 pacientes apresentaram resultado satisfatório, 2 apresentaram déficit estético notado pelo cirurgião e pelo paciente. Dos 7 pacientes submetidos à "técnica dos triângulos", todos apresentaram resultado satisfatório. Todos apresentaram melhora da ptose lateral do terço lateral e glabelar das sobrancelhas e diminuição das rugas verticais e frontais. A cirurgia revisional foi necessária em 2 pacientes nos quais ocorreu recorrência da ptose. Houve um paciente que apresentou paralisia do ramo frontal do nervo facial unilateral. Com a "técnica dos triângulos", 5 pacientes apresentaram cicatriz visível {{no local}} das incisões. CONCLUSÃO: A FE é uma técnica que produz resultados satisfatórios na grande maioria dos casos, com baixo índice de complicações. <b>Endoscopic</b> <b>forehead</b> <b>lift</b> (EFL) {{represents}} a significant progress, even replacing the classic coronal and pretriquial techniques.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2001 to January 2004, 67 patients were submitted to EFL, and 7 of these were submitted to the so called "triangles technique". Their ages ranged between 38 and 59 years; and 65 (97 %) were females. RESULTS: Of these, 56 patients presented satisfactory result and 2 presented aesthetic deficits noticed by the surgeon and the patient. Of the 7 patients submitted to the "triangles’ technique", all showed satisfactory results. All the patients had improvements on their ptosis of the lateral and glabellar third of the brows and reduction in vertical and frontal wrinkles. Revision surgery was necessary in 2 patients that had ptosis recurrence. There was one unilateral paralysis of the front branch of the facial nerve.

Midface lifting technique included temporal 2. 5 cm and 1. 5 cm vertical intraoral incision, midface subperiosteal undermining and midface elevation with cable sutures Bichat’s fat to DTF. Age mediana of patients who underwent endoscopic front lift was 46, patients who had endoscopic front lift and midface lift procedure age mediana was 40. Postoperative complication rate was 7. 5 % and included frontal branch weakness (n= 2), hematoma (n= 1), infraorbital nerve paresthesia (n= 1) and asymmetrical smile (n= 1). The main question is the quality of the results. We have reviewed 49 patients who were followed 6 months or more. Preoperative and postoperative life-size photographs were analyzed. The mean elevation mediana at medial canthus was 2. 2 mm, at medial limbus 2. 3 mm, at lateral limbus 2. 5 mm, at lateral canthus 2. 9 mm. Midface – lift effect resulted cheek elevation from 1. 07 till 4. 71 mm lip corner elevation 1. 03 mm to 3. 27 mm. We observed cheek elevation, improving nasolabial line, increasing volume of malar region, elevating lip angles in patients after endoscopic midface lift. [ [...] . ]...|$|R

40|$|The <b>{{forehead}}</b> <b>lift</b> (elevation of {{the forehead}} andbrow) is becoming {{recognized as an}} essential ele-ment in the rejuvenation of the aging face.

The reasons for this increased interest in brow lifting are multiple. Cosmetic surgeons are increasingly {{aware of the need}} to evaluate all facial features as a unit rather than considering only the cheek, neck, and eyelids. The proper positioning of the forehead and brow is an essen-tial component in the overall synergy of the face. Furthermore, the limited goal of elevation of low brows has been supplanted by the need to improve forehead rhytids and muscle imbalance, as well as to correct upper-eyelid aesthetics and lateral temporal laxity. 2,...|$|R

40|$|Patients {{with thick}} skin mainly exhibit the aging {{processes}} of sagging, whereas patients with thin skin develop wrinkles or volume loss. Asian skin is usually thicker {{than that of}} Westerners; and thus, the sagging of skin due to aging, rather than wrinkling, is the chief problem {{to be addressed in}} Asians. Asian skin is also relatively large in area and thick, implying that the weight of tissue to be lifted is considerably heavier. These factors account for the difficulties in performing a facelift in Asians. Facelifts can be divided into <b>forehead</b> <b>lift,</b> midface lift, and lower face lift. These can be performed individually or with 2 - 3 procedures combined...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: A clear {{knowledge}} of {{the location of the}} maxillo-facial foramina is essential for clinicians while performing endoscopic surgeries and regional nerve blocks. In the present study, a detailed analysis of the supraorbital foramen (SOF) and supraorbital notch (SON) of South Indian skulls is reported and the data are compared with those from other races and regions. Methods: Anatomical variation of SOF/SON was studied in 83 adult human skulls bilaterally, using “travelling Vernier’smicroscope”. The skulls belonged to the cadavers of South Indian origin. The parameters used were distanced between the SON/SOF and the nasal midline; distance between the SON/SOF and the frontozygomatic suture (FZS); shape and height of the SOF; transverse diameter of the SON; the presence of accessoryforamina (ACF) and their number; as well as the location and distance from the main SON/SOF. Results: SON was more frequently found than the SOF. Themean distance of SON/SOF to the nasal midline was 22. 24 mmon the right side and 22. 2 mm on the left side. The mean distanceof SON/SOF to the frontozygomatic suture was 29. 34 mm on theright side and 28. 7 mm on the left side. While the mean height ofSOF was 3. 5 mm on the right side and 3. 04 mm on the left side. Also, the mean transverse diameter of SON was 5. 17 mm on theright side and 5. 58 mm on the left side. The accessory supraorbitalforamina were observed in 66. 25 � 0 of cases. Conclusion: There is a difference in the position and dimensions of SOF /SON between different races and people of different regions.

40|$|The skin is the {{principal}} interface between {{the body and the}} surrounding world and thus serves as a protective barrier against trauma, temperature extremes and radiation. With receptors for pressure, movement, heat and cold, it also acts as sensory organ and through sweat secretion plays a role in thermoregulation and electrolyte metabolism. Not all of these functions are relevant to facial skin, however, cosmetic aspects are of vital importance. Disorders primarily affect the protective skin function in defect and scar areas. For operative correction, the following principles should be applied: Minimization of scar development by adherence to indicated incision lines in the face, preferred use of local skin flaps for defect coverage in order to obtain optimal results regarding texture, complexion and sensitivity of skin, as well as consideration of aesthetic units. Recent developments in this field are tissue culture, occlusive dressings, and the use of growth factors. Age-related skin changes with impairment of cosmetic function are characterized by the development of creases and looseness of skin. Rejuvenation has become an important segment of skin surgery. For surface treatment, especially of creases and acne scars, various types of laser treatment are employed. Deeper lines can be filled with filler materials. The integration of the superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) into face lift procedures has lead to more viable and natural results. Due to protruding tissue, blepharoplasty of the upper lid is often carried out in combination with <b>forehead</b> <b>lift</b> and eyebrow lift procedures. The optimized use of growth factors and synthetic materials, which serve as a matrix, are aimed at skin replacement which mimics the quality and functions of skin as closely as possible. On the whole, however, the reconstruction of defect through local tissue transfer is still considered as the treatment of choice...|$|R

The aims of this paper are to describe an endoscopically assisted technique of surgery, with emphasis on the subperiosteal, single-portal approach; to review the outcome of the surgery, and to define the indications for its use. Materials and Methods: We describe here a case series of ten patients, in whom a minimally invasive technique was employed for the removal of a forehead lipoma via an endoscopic, single-portal, subperiosteal approach. Results: The patients&#x 2032; age ranged from 26 to 54 years and the dimensions of the masses removed ranged from 1. 0 x 0. 5 cm to 3. 0 x 3. 0 cm.
