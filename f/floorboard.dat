25|$|Underbones are small-displacement {{motorcycles}} with a step-through frame, {{descendants of}} the original Honda Super Cub. They are differentiated from scooters by their larger wheels and their use of footpegs instead of a <b>floorboard.</b> They often have a gear shifter with an automatic clutch.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{countermeasures}} {{were taken to}} prevent {{the activities of the}} ninja.

25|$|From their inception, Vespa scooters {{have been}} known for their painted, pressed steel unibody which {{combines}} a complete cowling for the engine (enclosing the engine mechanism and concealing dirt or grease), a flat <b>floorboard</b> (providing foot protection), and a prominent front fairing (providing wind protection) into a structural unit.|$|E
25|$|Inevitably, the {{accumulated}} bodies beneath his <b>floorboards</b> attracted insects {{and created a}} foul odour — particularly throughout summer months. On occasions when Nilsen disinterred victims from beneath the <b>floorboards,</b> {{he noted that the}} bodies would be covered with pupae and infested with maggots; some victims' heads had maggots crawling out of eye sockets and mouths. Although Nilsen placed deodorants beneath the <b>floorboards</b> and sprayed insecticide about the flat twice daily, both the odour of decay and the presence of flies remained.|$|R
50|$|The {{upper floors}} with the {{exception}} of the toilet and service wet areas are made out of timber boarding supported on timber floor joist. Timber <b>floorboards</b> are thin horizontal structural members laid horizontally on the floor joist and joined to one another by the traditional tongue and groove method. The timber floor joists and <b>floorboards</b> used to be exposed and constitute the ceiling of the room below. The <b>floorboards</b> are now covered with concrete for fire safety reasons. The floor joists are beveled and moulded.|$|R

25|$|Superintendent Spence informs Hercule Poirot of {{the case}} of Mrs McGinty, an elderly charwoman, {{apparently}} killed by her lodger, James Bentley, for her savings of £30, which she kept under a <b>floorboard.</b> Bentley is convicted and to be executed for the crime, but Spence does not think he is guilty. Poirot agrees {{to go to the}} town of Broadhinny and investigate the murder further. Poirot finds that Mrs McGinty often worked as a cleaner at the houses of people in the village. No one wants to talk to Poirot, and most believe Bentley is the killer.|$|E
25|$|At the 2015 North American International Auto Show a more refined, {{hardcore}} {{and limited}} production {{version of the}} GT350 was unveiled called the GT350R, it still has the GT350's 5.2-liter flat-plane crank V8, making a rated 526hp and 429lb.-ft. of torque, but items like the air conditioning, the stereo, the trunk <b>floorboard,</b> all the carpeting, the rear seats, and the backup camera have been removed. The GT350R is also equipped with carbon-fiber wheels that each weigh approximately 15 pounds less than the aluminum wheels on the GT350. Overall, the GT350R is 130lbs. lighter than the GT350. A larger splitter and rear wing help improve downforce, with the wing drawing the car's weight balance more rearwards. A Torsen limited-slip differential with a 3:73 axle ratio helps handling further. Serial #001 was sold at the 2015 Barrett-Jackson Scottsdale Auction for $1,000,000 with the proceeds to benefit the JDRF.|$|E
25|$|At {{the next}} race in Spain, Williams brought in test driver David Coulthard as Hill's new teammate. Hill took the team's first {{victory of the}} season, by almost half a minute over Schumacher's Benetton, while Coulthard would retire due to an {{electrical}} problem. In Montreal, both Williams cars finished in the points {{for the first time}} that season, with Hill finishing second and Coulthard finishing fifth. In France, Nigel Mansell replaced Coulthard (in the first of four appearances), at the behest of Renault. At Silverstone, Damon Hill accomplished what had eluded his father, twice Formula One World Champion Graham Hill, by winning the British Grand Prix. Hill closed the points gap with Schumacher, who was disqualified from first at Spa after the Stewards found <b>floorboard</b> irregularities on his Benetton. He was banned for the next two races, and Hill capitalised on this with wins in Italy and a Williams 1–2 in Portugal.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} {{features}} Lee {{in a warehouse}} and begins with her burying a photograph beneath {{a hole in the}} floorboards. After she walks away singing [...] "Under your spell again, I can't say no to you" [...] while looking directly in the camera, the hole in the <b>floorboard</b> slowly covers up. As she walks by a bookcase, she touches the books placed on it and they start smoking. Then she goes to her desk to write in a diary, while the floorboards and items surrounding her begin to melt. After finishing with the writing, she walks by a mirror and takes a look at herself as it starts to melt. As she begins to play a baby grand piano, the piano and the room surrounding her begin to catch on fire until rain begins to fall and extinguishes the flames. The room appears to be burnt and wasted. As the sun begins to shine through the windows of the building, a small vine grows from the <b>floorboard</b> and expands across the room, and blue flowers begin to blossom from the vines above the piano.|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} mixed reviews. Allmusic's Zac Johnson {{wrote that}} it was [...] "too casual and off-the-cuff", but called it a [...] "wonderful, dusty summertime front-porch album, full of whiskey drawls and sly smiles, <b>floorboard</b> stomps and screen-door creaks". Jon Caramanica of Rolling Stone criticized the slower songs as stagnant, but complimented the upbeat songs. [...] Soul Journey also garnered significant acclaim. John Harris of Mojo magazine described the album as [...] "pretty much perfect", and Uncuts Barney Hoskyns favorably compared it to Bob Dylan and The Band's The Basement Tapes. Will Hermes of Entertainment Weekly wrote that Welch has [...] "never sounded deeper, realer, or sexier." [...] Soul Journey peaked at No.107 on the Billboard charts, and reached No.3 for Independent Albums.|$|E
500|$|Halo 2s soundtrack was {{composed}} primarily by Martin O'Donnell and his musical partner Michael Salvatori, {{the team that}} had composed the critically acclaimed music of Halo.

You want to make everything that was cool even better, and leave out {{all the stuff that}} was weak." [...] O'Donnell made sure that no part of the game would be completely silent, noting [...] "Ambient sound {{is one of the main}} ways to immerse people psychologically. A dark room is spooky, but add a creaking <b>floorboard</b> and rats skittering in the walls and it becomes really creepy." [...] Halo 2, unlike its predecessor, was mixed to take full advantage of Dolby 5.1 Digital surround sound.|$|E

2500|$|Wilford's {{assistant}} Claude {{emerges from}} the engine, shoots Namgoong, and invites Curtis inside where he meets an aging Wilford. Wilford reveals to Curtis that his revolution was actually orchestrated by himself and Gilliam to reduce the population and maintain {{the balance of the}} sealed ecosystem, and subsequently orders the elimination of 74% of the remaining tail passengers. He explains the importance of using fear and chaos to maintain a necessary order and leadership on the train. After letting Curtis experience being alone {{for the first time in}} seventeen years, Wilford asks Curtis to replace him. Curtis appears ready to accept, when Yona runs in and pulls up a <b>floorboard,</b> showing Curtis that small children from the tail section, including Andy and Timmy, are being trapped as replacement parts for [...] "extinct" [...] machinery; the tail section only serves to provide this resource to the engine. Curtis subdues Wilford and sacrifices an arm to save Timmy from this work, though Andy refuses to be saved.|$|E
2500|$|Kelly {{asked the}} studio for a {{straight}} acting role {{and he took}} the lead role in the early mafia melodrama: Black Hand (1950). This exposé of organized crime is set in New York's [...] "Little Italy" [...] during late 19th century, and focuses on the Black Hand, a group which extorts money upon threat of death. In real-life incidents upon which this film is based, it was the Mafia, not the Black Hand, who functioned as the villain. Even in 1950, however, Hollywood had to tread gingerly whenever dealing with big-time crime, it being safer to go after a [...] "dead" [...] criminal organization than a [...] "live" [...] one. There followed Summer Stock (1950) – Garland's last musical film for MGM – in which Kelly performed the celebrated [...] "You, You Wonderful You" [...] solo routine with a newspaper and a squeaky <b>floorboard.</b> In his book [...] "Easy the Hard Way", Joe Pasternak, head of one of the other musical units within MGM, singled out Kelly for his patience and willingness to spend as much time as necessary to enable the ailing Garland to complete her part.|$|E
2500|$|Mark Kermode, in The Observer, labeled Pan's Labyrinth as {{the best}} film of 2006, {{describing}} it as [...] "an epic, poetic vision in which the grim realities of war are matched and mirrored by a descent into an underworld populated by fearsomely beautiful monsters". Stephanie Zacharek wrote that the film [...] "works on so many levels {{that it seems to}} change shape even as you watch it", and Jim Emerson called the film [...] "a fairy tale of such potency and awesome beauty that it reconnects the adult imagination to the primal thrill and horror of the stories that held us spellbound as children". Roger Ebert reviewed the film after his surgery and put it on his Great Movies list on 27 August 2007; when he compiled his belated top ten films of 2006, Pan's Labyrinth was #1, with him stating [...] "But even in a good year I'm unable to see everything. And I'm still not finished with my 2006 discoveries. I'm still looking at more 2007 movies, too, and that list will run as usual in late December. Nothing I am likely to see, however, is likely to change my conviction that the year's best film was Pan's Labyrinth." [...] The New Yorkers Anthony Lane took special note of the film's sound design, saying it [...] "discards any hint of the ethereal by turning up the volume on small, supercharged noises: the creak of the Captain's leather gloves... the nighttime complaints of <b>floorboard</b> and rafter...." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sergeant 1st Class Orville P. Snorkel—Beetle's platoon {{sergeant}} and nemesis; {{introduced in}} 1951. [...] Sarge {{is known to}} frequently beat up Beetle for any excuse he can think of, leaving Beetle a shapeless pulp. Once, in the February 2, 1971 strip, he even shoved Beetle through a knothole in the <b>floorboard.</b> [...] Sarge is too lovable to be a villain, however. [...] Obese, snaggle-toothed, and volatile, Sarge can be alternately short-tempered and sentimental. He and Beetle {{seem to have a}} mutual love/hate relationship; much of the time there's an implied truce between them. [...] They share an uneasy alliance that sometimes borders on genuine (albeit unequal) friendship. In some early strips Sarge was married, but he was later retconned into an unmarried Army lifer, who knows next to nothing about civilian life. Despite his grouchiness and bossiness, Sarge does have a soft side, which he usually keeps concealed. He is from Pork Corners, Kansas. He was also known to be very foul-mouthed, even compared {{to the rest of the}} cast. One strip had Chaplain Staneglass suggesting that Sarge try to stop the Camp Swampy soldiers from swearing, only for Major Greenbrass to rebuke him, with Sarge in the meantime proceeding to swear up a storm after accidentally pricking himself with a tack he intended to put on a message billboard as Greenbrass tells Staneglass that said list of swears was [...] "just for a tack prick." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kirkcaldy {{became a}} centre for iron {{founding}} and linen manufacturing—specialising in coarser material (i.e. sailcloth). Although {{when the market}} for sail cloth started to dip, Michael Nairn for instance began to focus more towards floorcloth, which he started to produce in his new purpose built Scottish <b>floorboard</b> factory at Pathhead Sands, famously nicknamed [...] "Nairn’s folly" [...] for what would become universally known as linoleum. Linoleum was first introduced by the Scottish Linoleum Company (later Barry, Ostlere and Shepherd), due to the expired patent of Frederick Walton in 1877. Although the Michael Nairn & Co Ltd have since become famous, for their Trade Mark and being the world producers of the cloth. The cloth made from cork, wood flour and linseed oil, saw production conicide with the jute mills of Dundee - with some already present in the town, particularly the West Bridges Mill in Linktown. This made Kirkcaldy easily recognisable from the queer-like smell of the odour {{of one of the}} principal ingredients, linseed oil. The Nairns, as a family, became philanthropists bequeathing land for public and commercial use, {{over the course of several}} decades, as [...] "good deeds" [...] to the citizens of Kirkcaldy, with examples such as two public parks (Beveridge and Ravenscraig) and a museum, art gallery and library complex. Other industries such as coal, pottery, flour, malt, printing, light electrical engineering and furniture manufacturing flourished. Carpets, whose production coincided with linoleum, were also made in the town for a brief time by the firm Victoria Carpets until they moved their production to Kidderminster in 1901. The burghs of Pathhead, Linktown, Gallatown and Sinclairtown were also officially merged into the royal burgh of Kirkcaldy in 1876.|$|E
