40|$|Many large {{projects}} {{held over}} the last few decades in Europe have been based on the enhancement of community goods as a strategy to put in place sustainable urban regeneration. The inclusive nature of these goods and the social importance of the related decision-making processes suggests the need to involve the relevant community and to take into account its intentions and wishes regarding planning and organization. Therefore, before even starting to plan possible interventions, it is crucial to know what the members of the community think about the good in terms of social appreciation, in order to achieve socially sustainable choices. This paper offers a method to measure the social appreciation of community goods and describes the following: (a) deliberative <b>esteem</b> <b>value</b> technology to measure the social appreciation based on a combination between stated preference techniques and deliberative methods; (b) the criterion and methodology of the valuation technique proposed; and (c) an experimental application of the valuation technique pertinent to the specific case of the East Elevated Expressway of Rome...|$|E
40|$|This {{exploratory}} study identifies {{the dimensions of}} enduring involvement with wine. This article outlines the conceptualisation and measurement of enduring involvement of consumers with wine in regard to its value order {{in the hierarchy of}} needs. A convenience sample yielded 140 useable surveys after questionnaires were administered to pre-qualified consumer respondents. Data were analysed using the Predictive Analytics SoftWare statistical software package and its add-on feature, AMOS 18. It was found that wine consumers exhibit varying dimensions of enduring involvement according to the characteristics of the hierarchical order of need. The dimensions of enduring involvement identified to be associated with wine as a social and <b>esteem</b> <b>value</b> order product were: pleasure/interest, wine-related lifestyle/enjoyment and self-image/sign value. We conclude that enduring involvement is the more important of the two variants (situational and enduring) of the involvement paradigm. When harnessed by wine marketers, this may therefore boost sales and customer loyalty. Marketers need to know the drivers of wine consumers in relation to the product they buy. This will help in communicating the best strategies to adopt for consumers and how they are applied. ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to open again the {{discussion}} on the social function of Appraisal, as nowadays are quite noticeable the negative effects on the communities’ wellbeing caused by a systematic and prearranged trend towards a strong restriction of its task, up to deny, in some considerable occasions, the dignity of autonomous Science, which should play an important role for ensuring the fulfilment of a only goal: the economic justice. In order to explain this character of Appraisal, the first part of this contribution focuses on the description of some special and still relevant terms and concepts, that could be considered as different kind of value. In a certain way, these notions must be considered as real postulates derived from Economics. Inside the fundamental classification of value in its four main economic meanings (use value, <b>esteem</b> <b>value,</b> exchange value, cost value), it’s possible to find the sub-variation of the exchange value and the different meanings of the other ones. In order to avoid misunderstandings these last concepts, logically independent, must be kept quite separate from each others. This synthesis points out the strong relationship between Appraisal and Economics. In order to identify and assess value, Appraisal refers to Economics as this subject investigates the character of value and the process by which it could be determined. In this way the main theoretical issues are immediately solved. Starting from the idea that the occupation of an entire field of interest of Economics cannot be considered as unimportant as only the Appraisal allows to acknowledge the opinions of value and the method to express it, the second part of the paper deals with the problems that the Appraisal must be able to solve. At this level, it will be put in evidence the importance of its theory of value and its specific postulates with a special reference to the theory of ordinariness...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} to an emergent area on consumer value co-creation {{in a rapidly}} growing and exciting ‘new’ service market, Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) health services. The market for CAM health services is experiencing strong growth as consumers look for greater value, choice and control in managing their health. Despite the growth in this large health service market there is a paucity of research from a service marketing and consumer behaviour perspective. Yet, understanding what CAM consumers’ value and how they co-create value with CAM health services has important managerial implications. The purpose {{of this research is}} to explore what value CAM consumers’ gain and how they co-create value from their consumption experiences with CAM health services. The research adopts an interpretive approach employing an exploratory case study research strategy, using qualitative methods and an adapted version of the visual elicitation technique ZMET. The research process is semi-longitudinal and is conducted in three phases over a 12 month period. Sixteen CAM consumers with ‘lifestyle’ health complaints who use CAM health services participated in the study. The findings reveal eight consumer value components including: quality of care, treatment efficiency, physical environment, <b>esteem</b> <b>value,</b> social value, spiritual value, ethics and play. A consumer value model for CAM health services and potentially all health care services is proposed. Significantly this research found that CAM consumers co-create value on three levels according to their: approach to health care, preferred ‘consumer value co-creation relationship styles’ and engagement in ‘consumer value co-creation activities’. Consequently this thesis presents a typology of consumer value co-creation in CAM health services and develops a consumer value co-creation framework that can potentially be used for all health services. This research {{contributes to}} service marketing and consumer behaviour theory by extending the concepts of ‘consumer value’ and ‘value co-creation’ to incorporate findings from the CAM health service sector. The managerial implications of this research could help guide both CAM health care and mainstream medical practices to provide better health services and ultimately improved health outcomes for health care consumers. Future research could implement the unique three phase semi-longitudinal process and visual methods developed in this research, in various health care and service settings...|$|E

40|$|Educators and {{the general}} American public {{continue}} to favor character education programs in public schools, but many are unsure how best to teach values. Currently, and in the past, literature-based approaches to character education have received advocacy because of the values stories contain {{and because of the}} nature of story itself. Story is universal and uniquely character-molding and is a time-honored method to fostering understanding. This fact can be gleamed in religious and secular traditions alike, having been used and advocated by as wide array of individuals as Jesus Christ and N. Scott Momaday. Numerous bases—spiritual, historical, psychological, and philosophical—exist for using story. Stories are powerful, emotionally provocative, and effective not only in exploring the meaning of various values, but also in providing particular benefits, such as organizing ideas or enhancing awareness. For these reasons, literature-based approaches to character education can become the ideal foundation for imparting an understanding of universally <b>esteemed</b> <b>values</b> and building character traits...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} Nietzsche?s {{criticism}} on European civilization in Christian moral teaching {{as seen in}} some of Friedrich Nietzsche?s literary works. I will utilize Sartre atheist existentialism particularly on its discussion about human contingency, atheism, and nihilism. For Nietzsche, to criticize European civilization simple means to criticize the basic foundation from which the civilization developed which is morality. Nietzsche?s criticism on Christian moral teaching can be sum {{up in one of}} his famous statement; God is dead. Nietzsche?s "God is dead" thesis is objectified to revaluate Christian moral teachings. This thesis starts from Nietzsche criticism on the belief in Savior and the concept of human nature in Christianity. Nietzsche states that these two belief and concept are false. Man, according to Nietzsche, is in his nature innocent, therefore he needs no Savior to redeem his sins. More than psycological refutation, he proposes historical refutation that is able to bring God to the final death (requiem aeternam deo). Man is simply to be there. At that point, man is free, {{yet at the same time}} man is nothing (nihilism). The problem is not how man should understand his nothingness or nihilism but how man should live with it. To overcome this nihilism, Nietzsche proposes two ways. First, he marks the death of God in psychological and historical level. Second, he takes back all power to decide what is truth and untruth that owned by the churches and priests as the mouthpiece of God on earth. As a consequence, man is free to decide what is truth and untruth, and to <b>esteem</b> <b>values</b> and moral. At this point, Nietzsche wants to deconstruct Christian moral teachings. The slave morality, according to Nietzsche, belongs to Christian moral teachings because it is based on love that is commanded by God. On the contrary, Nietzsche proposes the master morality. For Nietzsche, the individual who exercise master morality has to go beyond accepted morality to create a new morality for himself. The master morality begins with self affirmation to power. It is the will to power, and the man who is able to exercis the will to power deserves to be called the overman. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a career is subject to an interaction and exchange process between employer and employee. In addition, the changing nature and meaning of a career in today’s competitive labor market has stimulated researchers to relate this with the psychological contract theory (e. g. Herriot, 1998; Sparrow & Cooper, 1998). However, the research domain of career self-management and the potential influence on the perception and evaluation of the psychological contract and on career activities offered by the organization in particular, has not been explicitly explored yet. Studies of Kossek et al. (1998) and Sturges et al. (2000) show that employees who actively manage their own career, hold higher expectations towards their employer, since they develop a clear idea on what their career objectives are and on {{how they want to}} achieve them. Hence, hypotheses are formulated that address the relationship between career self-management and (1) the perception and evaluation of the psychological contract, (2) the <b>esteemed</b> <b>value</b> and perception of career activities offered by the employer. To test our hypotheses, a cross-sectional survey among 491 employees of six Belgian organizations has been conducted. Our results suggest that the extent to which employees manage their own career has a significant impact on (1) the perception and evaluation of promises exchanged with their employer and (2) the importance they attach to career activities and the evaluation they make of the career activities offered by the company. First, employees who actively manage their own career, believe their employer has made more promises to them relating to different content domains of the psychological contract. Secondly, employees who actively manage their own career, are more positive on the fulfillment of their psychological contract. More specifically, this conclusion {{can be applied to the}} two dimensions of the psychological contract that are job-related, i. e. career development opportunities, job content. Thirdly, employees who actively manage their own career, attach more importance to the career activities offered by the company. In particular those career activities that consist of real guidance and steering from the organization. Furthermore, these employees also evaluate the provision of career management practices in the organization more positively. Our findings are discussed in view of the literature on career selfmanagement and psychological contracts and they add new important insights. ...|$|R

40|$|Healthy, fit {{and slim}} are highly <b>esteemed</b> <b>values.</b> Access to {{nutrition}} knowledge and healthy food {{has made it}} possible for many to try to change lifestyle. The principles are simple, eat a little less and lighter, and move a little more. Despite this, many fail. An increasing number are developing obesity and lifestyle diseases (NCDs). The thesis questions the principles and explores other ways to understand lifestyle change. Based on a literature study, the thesis documents that science of body and food are generalized from the concepts of corpus and nutrition, developed in nutrition science and related fields. This knowledge is based on one theory (atomic theory), studied in one context (laboratory) and in one perspective (from the outside, as recorded by researchers). The understanding of lifestyle is mainly based on intervention studies exploring changes in behavior indirectly, by measuring anatomy and physiology. This confined knowledge of body, food and lifestyle is the formal and valid knowledge in textbooks, national guidelines and health information. Based on field research in lifestyle courses, the thesis examines the meaning of body, food and lifestyle as practice. Through participatory observations and interviews the participants' knowledge of body, food and lifestyle is brought to the forefront. It is characterized by diverse meanings depending on the situation, relationship and context, being at the same time practical and reflexive. Praxis knowledge is developed through interaction with other people, nature and society, within the framework of economics, culture and language. The thesis shows that it is not valid to generalize from narrow theories of corpus, nutrition and behavior to existential and social phenomenon of body, food and lifestyle, as done in the nutrition principles of lifestyle change. The blurred terminology may be one explanation of why the NCD strategies have failed. The thesis presents a new practice theory of body, food and lifestyle, based on empirical data and supported by theories of social neurology, body sociology and bio-semiotics. Practice theory makes it possible to understand the interaction between biology, society and individual action, which is the great challenge of NCD. The thesis argues for a new term, shift, taking into account human characteristics as inertia, necessity and relatedness. Two examples show how practice theory and shift can realize health policy and new health initiatives. PhD i sosiologiPhD in Sociolog...|$|R
