For instance, we like Black Flag as much as early Bob Dylan and Dinosaur Jr. as much as Hank Williams... To us, hard-core punk is also folk music. We draw a close parallel between the two. We'll play both in the same set <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> chance. We don't have any biases as far as music is concerned.|$|E

Nonetheless, he was reappointed as Minister of Finance on 23 September, as part of the Tsipras' second cabinet. Chouliarakis, the interim Minister of Finance, was retained in the finance ministry as an Alternate Minister of Finance. Later in September, {{in an interview with the}} Financial Times, Tsakalotos said that it was [...] "absolutely critical that we get something on debt relief." [...] He added: [...] "By the second quarter of 2016, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> positive review, bank recapitalisation and debt relief, I don’t see any reason why there shouldn’t be a return to growth." [...] He also said that the new government would make serious attempts to crack down on tax evasion: [...] "It will be a central aspect of our policies, which will determine the success of the government, because it’s the only way the Greek people will accept difficult measures that show we’re all in the same boat." ...|$|E
500|$|From {{the very}} {{beginning}} of the series, fans had expressed dislike towards the character of Duncan. However, he decided to keep playing the character. In a later interview, he said, [...] "Obviously, I acted because I wanted the fans to like the experience. You want your performance to be liked. You don't want to suck. You don't want people to think you suck. That wasn't the goal." [...] Towards the end of the airing of the first season, he stated, [...] "I'm going to be there in every episode next season <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> second season. So people will either continue to hate me or things will change. Things are going to change for Duncan anyway, as the season resolves. There are going to be different sides of him that you're going to get to see." [...] Before going into the filming of season two, Thomas had told Dunn that he was being written off the show, and Dunn did not react badly to the news, as by that point, it [...] "was actually a decision" [...] for him to return for the second season at all.|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to the news confirming the development of HeartGold and SoulSilver, fans posted their reactions and commentary on the Internet. In particular, IGN editor Jack DeVries reasoned that {{the primary reason for}} the updated games was to be compatible with Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, allowing players to collect old Pokémon species that were previously unobtainable in the new games. He also expressed skepticism that the new titles could match the quality of the originals; stating, [...] "For me, Gold/Silver were amazing because they introduced so many new features that have since become standards for the series. It was the first, and only, time the Pokémon games have made such a significant expansion. These days we're lucky <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> new feature that invisibly changes the strategic elements of the game." [...] He reminisced over the qualities that made Gold and Silver truly unique, including the full color support, internal clock, Pokémon breeding, and PokéGear. Several months later, after DeVries had played through some of the game, he wrote, [...] "so far I like what I see, even if it all feels very familiar and formulaic at this point." ...|$|E
