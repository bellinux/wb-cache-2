50|$|My 50 {{years as}} a {{political}} cartoonist has been unique in one respect in that I have always finished the drawing completely without submitting the idea to the editor beforehand. The normal procedure is for the cartoonist to submit two or three rough sketches, one of which the editor may O.K. for completion. This latter method <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>time</b> waster, and causes the artist {{to depend on the}} judgement of others with regard to his own work. Eventually the artist loses the ability to distinguish a good idea from a poor one. It is a bad habit to be too dependent on others.|$|E

Although it was structurally completed, the money to complete it ran out and the project was eventually abandoned {{after the death of}} Charles II in February 1685. [...] Wren had cheerfully assured the King that the house would be complete in a year, to which Charles, who was feeling his age, made his famous reply that [...] "a year <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>time</b> in my life".
