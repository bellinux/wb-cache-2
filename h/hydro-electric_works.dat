Modern water works were also established at Jammu and Srinagar. The Church Missionary Society set up in Kashmir in the time of Maharaja Ranbir Singh, also contributed much to the promotion of public health and education. It opened its own schools and hospitals in the valley and ran them on modern lines. A great spill channel was constructed in 1904 to divert the flood waters of the a number Jhelum. It was followed by the construction of smaller channels and several irrigation canals in both the provinces of Jammu and Kashmir. The longest and most important of these was the Ranbir Canal in Jammu with a total length of 251 miles including that of its tributaries, it was fully completed in 1911 at the cost of Rs[...] This Canal also helped in propelling the turbines of the Jammu hydro-electric installation. Besides, 250 tanks were constructed in the Kandi areas of Jammu with a view to removing the great distress of the residents of these arid tracks. The power obtained from the <b>hydro-electric</b> <b>works</b> established at Mohara in 1907 was used not only for lighting and industrial purposes but also for dredging operations which were carried out in the Jhelum below Baramulla to remove silt and boulders.|$|E
50|$|Lawrence {{was educated}} at Prince Alfred College, and Adelaide University, {{where he was}} a {{brilliant}} student, winning the Angas Engineering Exhibition in 1892 and sharing the Angas Scholarship for Engineering with Alfred Chapple the following year.He went to England around 1895 and studied at University College London winning a Gilchrist Scholarship in 1896. He studied under Professor Beare (another PAC alumnus), and Professor S. P. Thompson, then gained valuable experience at Callenders Cables & Construction works in Erith, Kent. He continued his studies on the Continent, where he was impressed by Swiss electrical engineering practices, then returned to Adelaide on the Star of Australia in June 1900, only to find that his father had recently died. There was practically no electrical work available in Adelaide at that time, so in November 1900 he took up a position as Assistant Engineer of State Tramways with the New South Wales Government, which was embarking on an ambitious tramway scheme on Sydney, then in 1903 proceeded to New Zealand as electrical engineer for the city of Christchurch. He was successively engineer to the Christchurch Tramway Construction Company, lecturer in electrical engineering at Canterbury College, engineer in charge of the Rotorua district, and in 1910 was appointed assistant electrical engineer to the New Zealand Government, under Evan Parry B.Sc. (1865-1938). He was responsible for the installation of the Lake Coleridge hydro-electric power plant of 8,000 horsepower (around 6 MW) capacity, the first hydro-electric installation in the Dominion, and for the system's commercial development. Mr. Parry returned to England in 1918, and Birks was appointed chief electrical engineer, responsible for the construction of <b>hydro-electric</b> <b>works,</b> which in the North Island alone amounted to £10,300,000 for plant of a total capacity of 165,000 h.p., and about 2,000 miles km of new 110,000 volt transmission lines. A similar system was planned for the South Island.|$|E

The new {{structure}} permitted {{the replacement of}} several locks and to stabilize {{the course of the}} Meuse. It incorporates a <b>hydro-electric</b> plant. <b>Work</b> began on the project in 1928, with metal fabrications made locally by Cockerill.

In 1973 the Oliver Chilled Plow <b>Works</b> <b>hydro-electric</b> plant was demolished {{to make room}} for the construction of the Century Center which was completed in 1977. Currently the West Race still exists as a canal North of Jefferson Boulevard and South of Colfax Avenue on the banks of Century Center between Pier Park and Island Park. In the early 1980s, the East Race canal was re-excavated and turned into a man made whitewater kayaking course known as the East Race Waterway.|$|R
40|$|On July 1, 1984 the Bonneville Power Administration and the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife {{entered into}} an {{agreement}} to initiate fish habitat enhancement work in the Joseph Creek subbasin of the Grande Ronde River Basin in northeast Oregon. In July of 1985 the Upper and Middle Grande Ronde River, and Catherine Creek subbasins {{were included in the}} intergovernmental contract, and on March 1, 1996 the Wallowa River subbasin was added. The primary goal of ''The Grande Ronde Basin Fish Habitat Enhancement Project'' is to access, create, improve, protect, and restore riparian and instream habitat for anadromous salmonids, thereby maximizing opportunities for natural fish production within the basin. This project provided for implementation of Program Measure 703 (C) (1), Action Item 4. 2 of the Northwest Power Planning Council's Columbia River Basin Fish and Wildlife Program (NPPC, 1987), and continues to be implemented as offsite mitigation for mainstem fishery losses caused by the Columbia River <b>hydro-electric</b> system. All <b>work</b> conducted by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife is on private lands and therefore requires that considerable time be spent developing rapport with landowners to gain acceptance of, and continued cooperation with this program throughout 10 - 15 year lease periods. This project calls for passive regeneration of habitat, using riparian enclosure fencing as the primary method to restore degraded streams to a normative condition. Active remediation techniques using plantings, off-site water developments, site-specific instream structures, or whole channel alterations are also utilized where applicable. Individual projects contribute to and complement ecosystem and basin-wide watershed restoration efforts that are underway by state, federal, and tribal agencies, and local watershed councils. Work undertaken during 2000 included: (1) Implementing 2 new projects in the Grande Ronde drainage, and retrofitting one old project that will protect an additional 1. 3 miles of stream and 298. 3 acres of habitat; (2) Conducting instream work activities in 3 streams to enhance habitat and/or restore natural channel dimensions, patterns or profiles; (3) Improving fish passage in Bear Creek to restore tributary and mainstem access; (4) Planting and seeding 6. 7 stream miles with 7, 100 plants and 365 lbs. of seed; (5) Establishing 18 new photopoints and retaking 229 existing photopoint pictures; (6) Monitoring stream temperatures at 12 locations on 6 streams; (7) completing riparian fence, water gap and other maintenance on 98. 7 miles of project fences. Since initiation of the project in 1984 over 62 miles of anadromous fish bearing streams and 1, 910 acres of habitat have been protected, enhanced and maintained...|$|R
