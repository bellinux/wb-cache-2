5|$|<b>I</b> <b>believe</b> in all sincerity {{that if you}} do not deflate the {{opposition}} candidate before your own campaign gets started, the odds are you are doomed to defeat. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> it is a smear to attack an individual on matters that have no relationship whatsoever to the campaign... {{but it is not a}} smear if you point out the record of your opponent.|$|E
5|$|It is, <b>I</b> <b>believe,</b> universally {{agreed that}} the only way to keep Indians from harassing the country is to visit them. But we find, by experience, that burning their empty towns has not the desired effect. They can soon build others. They must be {{followed}} up and beaten, or the British, whom they draw their support from, totally driven out of their country. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> if Detroit was demolished, it would be a good step toward giving some, at least, temporary ease to this country.|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>believed</b> {{nothing of}} that part; but <b>I</b> <b>believed,</b> as it was, that {{whatever}} was done, Amy had done it; and that, in short, Amy {{had made her}} away; and <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> it the more, because Amy came no more near me, but confirmed her guilt by her absence.|$|R

5|$|To me Reform Judaism is {{an irresistible}} conviction. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> {{it to be}} the {{religion}} of the Jewish future, while I regard orthodoxy as a survival that may have a galvanized life now and then, but on the whole is doomed.|$|E
5|$|But how, {{it may be}} asked, can any {{analogous}} principle {{apply in}} nature? <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> it can and does apply most efficiently, from the simple circumstance that the more diversified the descendants from any one species become in structure, constitution, and habits, by so much will they be better enabled to seize on many and widely diversified places in the polity of nature, and so be enabled to increase in numbers.|$|E
5|$|<b>I</b> <b>believe</b> few plays {{have ever}} adventured {{into the world}} under greater {{disadvantage}} than this. First, as it succeeded a comedy which, for the continued space of twenty-eight nights, received as great (and as just) applauses, as ever were bestowed on the English Theatre. And secondly, as it is co-temporary with an entertainment which engrosses the whole talk and admiration of the town.|$|E

60|$|A {{man must}} be terribly weak and profoundly desperate to be able, under such circumstances, to beard the Warden in solitary. Or {{he may be}} both, and, in addition, he may have faith. I know now that I had the faith and so acted on it. <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> what Morrell had told me. <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> in the lordship of the mind over the body. <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> that not even a hundred days in the jacket could kill me.|$|R

5|$|<b>I</b> <b>believe</b> that my large {{statue in}} ceramic, the Tueuse ("The Murderess"), is an {{exceptional}} piece such as no ceramist has made until now and that, in addition, {{it would look}} very well cast in bronze (without retouching and without patina). In this way the buyer would not only have the ceramic piece itself, but also a bronze edition with which to make money.|$|E
5|$|<b>I</b> <b>believe</b> that, {{beyond a}} doubt, {{we are now}} facing the best {{opportunity}} we have had in 15 years to build a lasting peace in the Middle East.

5|$|I {{spend my}} time out in the open, on the shingle beach {{when the weather is}} bad or the fishing boats go out, or I go into the {{countryside}} which is very beautiful here, that I find perhaps still more charming in winter than in summer and, naturally I work all the time, and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> that this year I am going to do some serious things.|$|E

40|$|When I {{was a young}} man, I {{was doing}} a lot of civil rights, civil liberties, and indigent {{criminal}} defense work, and <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> in the constitutionalized adversarial system. <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> in the constitutional rights of the Fifth Amendment and the Sixth Amendment, due process of law, the right to the effective assistance of counsel, the right to trial including an advocate {{who was going to be}} your champion against a hostile world. <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> in the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> in the right to confront witnesses against you, the privilege against self-incrimination, equal protection of the laws, and of the right of autonomy of each of us to decide the important things in his or her life...|$|R

5|$|In 1889, Huxley wrote:Therefore, {{although}} it be, as <b>I</b> <b>believe,</b> demonstrable {{that we have}} no real knowledge of the authorship, or of the date of composition of the Gospels, as they have come down to us, and that nothing better than more or less probable guesses can be arrived at on that subject.|$|E
5|$|The {{design was}} {{reviewed}} by the Commission of Fine Arts, and in an April 29, 1976, letter, Commission member J. Carter Brown praised the design: <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> {{this would be a}} superb design for United States Coinage, rooted as it is in a great tradition, being based on the 'Liberty Cap cent' of 1794, following Augustin Dupré's Libertas Americana medal commemorating Saratoga and Yorktown (1777–1781).|$|E
5|$|These were {{difficulties}} {{which seemed}} rather {{to require the}} superior force of a Wycherley, or a Congreve, than of a raw and unexperienced pen; for <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> I may boast that none ever appeared so early upon the stage. However, such was the candour of the audience, the play was received with greater satisfaction than I should have promised myself from its merit, had it even preceded the Provoked Husband.|$|E
