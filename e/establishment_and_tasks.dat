As {{the result of this}} study, the current process may be shortened considerably to create new profit when the new communication technology is applied. Therefore, for such profit creation, the process improvement solution for the field of cadastral application of communication system used with total station, GPS operation software, Network-GPS, Ntrip, Wibro and Zig-bee, among the applicable solutions for cadastral surveying field with the recently used latest communication technology. In conclusion, the conceptual process <b>establishment</b> <b>and</b> <b>task</b> processing for current cadastral surveying working processor may be simplified as applying the information technology. Especially, as most of current cadastral surveys are consisted of the total station, GPS, and the CAD-type software which controls and measures them, they apply the primary information technology, and depend on the 3 voices of observer, leader and computer operator for shape editing and Geo-Coding processing. As the wireless internet based Wibro communication is applied for this working processor, the mutual processing could be applied with wireless internet.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{how much of}} the variation in rat urinary aeroallergen (RUA) levels may be explained by differences in site and exposure group in research <b>establishments</b> <b>and</b> we identify <b>task</b> categories associated with high RUA levels. In this population 73 % of the variability in RUA levels could be explained by exposure group, site and their interaction term. Exposure group alone explained the majority of the variation (69 %). The task category associated with the highest RUA level was cleaning out, followed by indirect contact with rats and handling rats. The task categories associated with the lowest levels were slide production, post mortem and experiments. These results may help choose appropriate exposure measures for epidemiological studies in research establishments in the future and may help reduce the incidence of laboratory animal allergy...|$|R
