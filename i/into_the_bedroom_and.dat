5|$|The rebels {{moved into}} Magomero {{in the early}} evening, while Livingstone {{and his wife were}} {{entertaining}} some dinner guests. The estate official, Duncan MacCormick, was in another house nearby. A third building, occupied by Emily Stanton, Alyce Roach and five children, contained a small cache of weapons and ammunition belonging to the local rifle club. The insurgents quietly broke into the Livingstone's house and injured him during hand-to-hand fighting, prompting him to take refuge in the bedroom, where his wife attempted to treat his wounds. The rebels forced their way <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom,</b> <b>and</b> after capturing his wife, decapitated Livingstone. MacCormick, who had been alerted, was killed by a rebel spear. The attackers took the women and children of the village prisoner but shortly released them unhurt, having reportedly treated them well. It has been suggested that Chilembwe may have hoped to use the women and children as hostages, but this remains unclear. The attack on Magomero, and in particular the killing of Livingstone, had great symbolic significance for Chilembwe's men. The two Mauser rifles captured from the plantation formed the basis of the rebel armoury {{for the rest of the}} uprising.|$|E
25|$|The {{northwest}} side {{can be broken}} down into three sections, each corresponding to the interior room it encloses. All the sections are plank construction with slab exterior. Each of the three sections contains a window. The first window looks <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>and</b> a double hung two-over-two sash measuring ten inches high by eight inches wide. The second window looks into the bathroom, and is identical to the bedroom window. The third window, looking into the kitchen, is a two-over-two casement measuring ten inches high by fourteen inches wide.|$|E
25|$|Mosby had {{his closest}} brush with death on December 21, 1864, near Rector's Crossroads in Virginia. While dining {{with a local}} family, Mosby was fired on through a window, and the ball entered his abdomen two inches below the navel. He managed to stagger <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>and</b> hide his coat, which had his only {{insignia}} of rank. The commander of the Union detachment, Maj. Douglas Frazar of the 13th New York Cavalry, entered the house and—not knowing Mosby's identity—inspected the wound and pronounced it mortal. Although left for dead, Mosby recovered {{and returned to the}} war effort once again two months later.|$|E

50|$|The {{opposite}} side of the house has rooms along what may have been a former verandah. A verandah at the rear has been extended into a timber deck. The interior of the building has walls of tongue and groove timber boards and timber floors. The core rooms have high ceilings and the doors that open from <b>the</b> main room <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms</b> <b>and</b> study have decorative transoms. The ceilings of all rooms on the perimeter of the house have raked ceilings, which suggests that the house has evolved from a four-room core and verandahs. The kitchen and bathroom are modern.|$|R

You will never want to leave your room. The informative lecture will satisfy all your beet curiosity, and the dawn goose walk will tug at your heart strings. Table making never seemed so possible.

25|$|Rev. Parris {{runs back}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>and</b> various villagers arrive: {{the wealthy and}} {{influential}} Thomas and his wife, Ann Putnam, respected local woman Rebecca Nurse, and the Putnam's neighbor, farmer Giles Corey. The villagers, who had not heard the argument, assume that the hymn had caused Betty's screaming, Tensions between them soon emerge. Mrs. Putnam is a bereaved parent seven times over; she blames witchcraft for her losses and Betty's ailment. Rebecca is rational and suggests a doctor be called instead. Mr. Putnam and Corey have been feuding over land ownership. Parris is unhappy with his salary and living conditions as minister, and accuses Proctor of heading a conspiracy to oust him from the church. Abigail, standing quietly in a corner, witnesses all of this.|$|E
25|$|On November 28, Arbuckle testified as the defense's final witness. Arbuckle was simple, direct, and unflustered in both {{direct and}} cross examination. In his testimony, Arbuckle claimed that Rappe (whom he {{testified that he}} had known {{for five or six}} years) came into the party room (1220) around noon that day, and that some time {{afterward}} Mae Taub (daughter-in-law of Billy Sunday) asked him for a ride into town, so he went to his room (1219) to change his clothes and discovered Rappe in the bathroom vomiting in the toilet. Arbuckle then claimed Rappe told him she felt ill and asked to lie down, and that he carried her <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>and</b> asked a few of the party guests to help treat her. When Arbuckle {{and a few of the}} guests re-entered the room, they found Rappe on the floor near the bed tearing at her clothing and going into violent convulsions. To calm Rappe down, they placed her in a bathtub of cool water. Arbuckle and Fischbach then took her to room 1227 and called the hotel manager and doctor. After the doctor declared that Rappe was just drunk, Arbuckle then drove Taub to town.|$|E
500|$|After Wilde {{left the}} court, {{a warrant for}} his arrest was applied for on charges of sodomy and gross indecency. Robbie Ross found Wilde at the Cadogan Hotel, Knightsbridge, with Reginald Turner; both men advised Wilde to go at once to Dover {{and try to get}} a boat to France; his mother advised him to stay and fight. Wilde, lapsing into inaction, could only say, [...] "The train has gone. It's too late." [...] Wilde was arrested for [...] "gross indecency" [...] under Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885, a term meaning {{homosexual}} acts not amounting to buggery (an offence under a separate statute). At Wilde's instruction, Ross and Wilde's butler forced their way <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>and</b> library of 16 Tite Street, packing some personal effects, manuscripts, and letters. Wilde was then imprisoned on remand at Holloway where he received daily visits from Douglas.|$|E

6000|$|The cobbler {{shrugged his}} shoulders, and Swithin rushed upstairs. The rooms were empty. The {{furniture}} remained, but all {{signs of life}} were gone. One of his own bouquets, faded, stood in a glass; the ashes of a fire were barely cold; little scraps of paper strewed the hearth; already the room smelt musty. He went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms,</b> <b>and</b> {{with a feeling of}} stupefaction stood staring at the girls' beds, side by side against the wall. A bit of ribbon caught his eye; he picked it up and put it in his pocket--it was a piece of evidence that she had once existed. By the mirror some pins were dropped about; a little powder had been spilled. He looked at his own disquiet face and thought, 'I've been cheated!' ...|$|R
500|$|At around 3:20 p.m. on June 23, 1989, Sherron King {{returned}} {{from work to}} her apartment in Washington Terrace, Utah to find the body of her daughter Charla in the bedroom with a nightgown wrapped around her head and panties stuffed in her mouth. After calling the police, she was instructed to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation and discovered that Charla had been strangled {{to death with a}} telephone cord. Charla's foster grandmother Bertha Poster stated that she had dropped Charla off at the apartment at about 1:30 p.m. after visiting the mall. Charla had been planning to celebrate her 12th birthday at an amusement park on the next day. Prosecutors believe that John entered the house with intent on sexually molesting the girl. When she caught him in the house, Prosecutors believe, he chased her <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom,</b> <b>and</b> placed her underwear in her mouth. He raped her, placed a nightgown over her head, and strangled her to death.|$|E

40|$|<b>Bedrooms</b> are <b>the</b> primary {{place of}} relaxation, {{where we all}} retire {{to take a good}} sleep and refresh, away from the world <b>and</b> worries. <b>The</b> <b>bedroom</b> {{interior}} design is extremely important in order to provide that instant feel of relaxation and here are a few tips: the first thing that meets the eyes are the colors used on the walls, carpets and bed set so, they all must be soothing in pastel colors in order to provide a relaxing effect. ANCIENT BEDROOMS We had <b>the</b> view <b>into</b> <b>the</b> opulent <b>and</b> over-decorated <b>Bedrooms</b> of <b>the</b> Royals <b>and</b> their beds which might not have been as comfortable as they looked like first hand - now we have a peek <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms</b> <b>and</b> beds of people who lived many centuries ago. Some of them must have been quite comfortable with the appropriate bedding but then, thinking of the hygiene in these times, makes feel shiver. In ancient times people never thought about good designing, people just wanted things to look shining hence, that time people were not that aware of designing the rooms in a proper manner...|$|R
