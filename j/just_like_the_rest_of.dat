5|$|By this time, the Soviet {{pilots were}} {{familiar}} with Hartmann's radio call sign of Karaya 1, and the Soviet Command had put a price of 10,000 rubles on the German pilot's head. Hartmann, for a time, used a black tulip design around the engine cowling near the spinner of his aircraft, so Soviet personnel consequently nicknamed him Cherniy Chort ("Black Devil"). However, Hartmann's opponents were often reluctant to stay and fight if they noticed his personal design. As a result, this aircraft was often allocated to novices, who could fly it in relative safety. On 21 March, it was Hartmann who scored JG52s 3,500th victory of the war. Adversely, the reluctance of the Soviet airmen to fight caused Hartmann's kill rate to drop. Hartmann then had the tulip design removed, and his aircraft painted <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> his unit. Consequently, in the following two months, Hartmann amassed over 50 victories.|$|E

Lugnvik was incorporated into the city in 1954 and Östersund was <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> Jämtland affected by the Rehn-Meidner-model, though {{not in the same}} way. The Swedish Keynesian politic was launched in order to improve the mobility of the labour force.

As an urban area Östersund was affected by the Million Programme and urban districts like Körfältet were created.|$|E

Sḵwxwú7mesh culture has been drastically changed from their pre-European contact. [...] Despite these attempts, their culture remains intact and thriving. Some cultural practices and customs are not done in the same fashion, but still occur.

2500|$|The {{fire and}} the long siege had taken their toll on the city. The Spanish left in 1577 and under the Agreement of Veere, Protestants and Catholics were given equal rights, though in {{government}} the Protestants clearly had the upper hand and Catholic possessions once seized were never returned. To restore the economy and attract workers for the brewing and bleaching businesses (Haarlem was known for these, thanks to the clean water from the dunes), the Haarlem council decided to promote the pursuit of arts and history, showing tolerance for diversity among religious beliefs. This attracted a large influx of Flemish and French immigrants (Catholics and Hugenots alike) who were fleeing the Spanish occupation of their own cities. [...] Expansion plans soon replaced plans of rebuilding the destroyed city walls. <b>Just</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the country, the Golden Age in the United Provinces had started.|$|E

Of late, {{he had been in the}} habit of getting his breakfast at Farmer Brown's house every morning, so now when he began to run from Shadow the Weasel he just naturally ran in the direction of Farmer Brown's house from force of habit.

All men are interested in Montaigne in proportion as all men find more of themselves in him, and all men see but one image in the glass which the greatest of poets holds up to nature, an image which at once startles and charms them with its familiarity. Fabulists always endow their animals with the passions and desires of men. But if an ox could dictate his confessions, what glimmer of understanding should we find in those bovine confidences, unless on some theory of pre existence, some blank misgiving of a creature moving about in worlds not realized? The truth is, that we recognize the common humanity of Rousseau in the very weakness that betrayed him into this conceit of himself; we find he is <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> us in this very assumption of essential difference, for among all animals man {{is the only one}} who tries to pass for more than he is, and so involves himself in the condemnation of seeming less.|$|E
