5|$|A Newsboy Hero is an American silent short drama film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. A standard melodrama, it has the alcoholic John Bailey return home in a drunken state. He strikes his wife and by this act drives {{his wife and child}} from the house. They go out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> and fall asleep, but are saved by a newspaper boy and taken home. John searches for them, but believes they are dead after reading a newspaper story and decides to commit suicide. He is saved {{by a member of the}} Salvation Army and then is reunited with his family. The only known credit in the production is that of Marie Eline as the couple's child, Marie. The film was released on February 24, 1911, and it received mixed reviews by critics over its melodramatic plot, but the actors strong skills was the strongest redeeming factor in the negative reviews. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|Continuing north, {{they soon}} {{run out of}} gas, but receive help from the Aurora Boreanaz, who instructs them to stay at a nearby cabin. The two survive {{the night in the}} cabin and set out on foot the next morning. They finally make it to Santa's workshop, only to find a dark, gloomy factory in a dreary, polluted, lifeless wasteland; Santa a sickly and {{depressed}} old man, the elves all horribly mutated and inbred due to Santa's attempts {{to keep up with the}} increasing gift demands year after year, and the reindeer carnivorous, feral monsters that eat the elves who wander out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> to die of exhaustion. Santa suddenly collapses and is too sick to deliver the presents. Brian and Stewie agree to do it, but end up wasting an hour and a half at their first house after the family discover their presence, before discovering they were in the wrong house. Realizing that they will not be able to complete the delivery in time, and understanding firsthand the impossibility of Santa's job, Stewie and Brian abandon the delivery in lieu of another plan.|$|E

25|$|As for her {{relationship}} with Lee, it’s clear that Hohoff provided more than just editorial guidance. One winter night, as Charles J. Shields recounts in Mockingbird: A Portrait of Harper Lee, Lee threw her manuscript out her window and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow,</b> before calling Hohoff in tears. “Tay told her to march outside immediately {{and pick up the}} pages,” Mr. Shields writes.|$|E
25|$|Brody died, as did five {{passengers}} {{aboard the}} train. The lead car caught fire and was eventually destroyed. Damage {{was estimated at}} $3.7million. Passengers who escaped or were evacuated and were not injured were taken to a nearby climbing gym called The Cliffs, where {{they were able to}} stay warm until buses arrived. Nine passengers were taken to Westchester Medical Center, with one of them in very serious condition. A police helicopter with thermal imaging equipment scanned the nearby Kensico Cemetery in search of survivors who might have wandered away from the scene and collapsed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow,</b> but found none. There were a total of six deaths and fifteen injuries.|$|E
25|$|Grooming {{attachments}} – Attachments {{for large}} groomers include: a front blade, a tiller, a renovator and track setter. The leading front blade repositions snow {{in front of}} the machine for trailing equipment to recondition. The renovator digs <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> pack to aerate and mix the old and new snow up to 30cm deep, as needed. The tiller attached behind the machine conditions the snow into aa soft, granular consistency, ready for its comb, which packs the snow into a finished surface. For setting classic tracks, the groomer trails special pans, which mould the tracks. Attachments for snowmobiles perform the same functions at a smaller scale and include a roller to compact the snow over a wide swath and a drag to level the snow behind the roller.|$|E

The first sight that met his bewildered gaze was three pair of {{expanded}} eyeballs and three double rows of grinning teeth, {{a few feet from}} his face. Uttering a cry of terror, he fell back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hole, <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> closed over him, and he was gone! ...|$|R

500|$|Store Frøen's rural {{surroundings}} {{shaped the}} nature of Nansen's childhood. In the short summers the main activities were swimming and fishing, while in the autumn the chief pastime was hunting for game in the forests. The long winter months were devoted mainly to skiing, which Nansen began to practice {{at the age of}} two, on improvised skis. [...] At the age of 10 he defied his parents and attempted the ski jump at the nearby Huseby installation. This exploit had near-disastrous consequences, as on landing the skis dug deep <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow,</b> pitching the boy forward: [...] "I, head first, described a fine arc in the air ... hen I came down again I bored <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> up to my waist. The boys thought I had broken my neck, but as soon as they saw there was life in me ... a shout of mocking laughter went up." [...] Nansen's enthusiasm for skiing was undiminished, though as he records, his efforts were overshadowed by those of the skiers from the mountainous region of Telemark, where a new style of skiing was being developed. [...] "I saw this was the only way", wrote Nansen later.|$|E
500|$|The Germans {{are waiting}} with loudhailers and orders {{to head for}} a hot bath.

I showed him the corpses all around him; they too had wanted to rest here... I yelled against the wind...I felt I was not arguing with him, but with death itself, with the death he had already chosen." [...] An alert sounds, the camp lights go out, and Eliezer, exhausted, follows the crowd to the barracks, leaving his father behind. He wakes at dawn on a wooden bunk, remembering that he has a father, and goes in search of him.|$|E
500|$|In 1841 and 1842, Louis Agassiz {{drilled holes}} in the Unteraargletscher in the Alps; these were drilled with iron rods and did not produce cores. [...] The deepest hole {{achieved}} was 60m. [...] On Erich von Drygalski's Antarctic expedition in 1902 and 1903, 30m holes were drilled in an iceberg south of the Kerguelen Islands and temperature readings were taken. [...] The first scientist to create a snow sampling tool was James E. Church, described by Pavel Talalay as [...] "the father of modern snow surveying". [...] In the winter of 1908–1909, Church constructed steel tubes with slots and cutting heads to retrieve cores of snow up to 3m long. [...] Similar devices are in use today, modified to allow sampling {{to a depth of}} about 9m. [...] They are simply pushed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> and rotated by hand.|$|E

500|$|Believing {{that the}} {{defenders}} were completely destroyed at the inlet, the Chinese stopped their attacks {{and proceeded to}} loot the US positions for food and clothing. As the morning came on 28 November, the 3rd Battalion, 31st Infantry counterattacked the PVA 239th Regiment at the inlet, sending the surprised Chinese back in a complete rout. In the afternoon, Almond flew into the perimeter of RCT-31, convinced that RCT-31 {{was strong enough to}} begin its attack north and deal with whatever [...] "remnants" [...] of Chinese forces that were in their way. Almond ordered Colonel Allan D. Maclean, the commander of RCT-31, to resume the offensive north while presenting Silver Stars to three of Maclean's officers. In disgust, Lieutenant Colonel Don C. Faith, Jr., the commander of the 1st Battalion, 32nd Infantry, threw his medal <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow.</b>|$|E
500|$|The classic {{style is}} often used on {{prepared}} trails (pistes) that have pairs of parallel grooves (tracks) cut <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow.</b> It {{is also the most}} usual technique where no tracks have been prepared. With this technique, each ski is pushed forward from the other stationary ski in a striding and gliding motion, alternating foot to foot. With the [...] "diagonal stride" [...] variant the poles are planted alternately {{on the opposite side of}} the forward-striding foot; with the [...] "kick-double-pole" [...] variant the poles are planted simultaneously with every other stride. At times, especially with gentle descents, double poling is the sole means of propulsion. On uphill terrain, techniques include the [...] "side step" [...] for steep slopes, moving the skis perpendicular to the fall line, the [...] "herringbone" [...] for moderate slopes, where the skier takes alternating steps with the skis splayed outwards, and, for gentle slopes, the skier uses the diagonal technique with shorter strides and greater arm force on the poles.|$|E
500|$|The rescuers {{concealed}} {{the fate}} of the snowshoe party, informing the rescued immigrants only that they did not return because they were frostbitten. Patty and Tommy Reed were soon too weak to cross the snowdrifts, and no one was strong enough to carry them. Margret Reed faced the agonizing predicament of accompanying her two older children to Bear Valley and watching her two frailest be taken back to Truckee Lake without a parent. She made rescuer Aquilla Glover swear on his honor as a Mason that he would return for her children. Patty Reed told her, [...] "Well, mother, if you never see me again, do the best you can." [...] Upon their return to the lake, the Breens flatly refused them entry to their cabin but, after Glover left more food, the children were grudgingly admitted. The rescue party was dismayed to find that the first cache station had been broken into by animals, leaving them without food for four days. After struggling on the walk over the pass, John Denton slipped into a coma and died. Ada Keseberg died soon afterwards; her mother was inconsolable, refusing to let the child's body go. After several days' more travel through difficult country, the rescuers grew very concerned that the children would not survive. Some of them ate the buckskin fringe from one of the rescuer's pants, and the shoelaces of another, to the relief party's surprise. On their way down from the mountains, they met the next rescue party, which included James Reed. Upon hearing his voice, Margret sank <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow,</b> overwhelmed.|$|E

50|$|The {{origins of}} the snow-based dessert by this name are hard to verify, but the {{technique}} of using snow as a main ingredient in a dessert is very old. Common ingredients for this variety are a dairy based ingredient, sugar and a flavouring agent. In adding {{a small amount of}} dairy-based liquid and a flavouring agent (similar to ice cream ingredients) <b>into</b> clean <b>snow,</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> melts and congeals into a simple ice cream substitute.|$|R

40|$|Measurements of snow {{temperature}} distribution {{indicated that the}} temperature was considerably higher {{in the vicinity of}} the station than in <b>the</b> natural <b>snow</b> layers far from it.

A narrow stance is more common for riders looking for quicker turn edge-hold (i.e. small radius turns).
