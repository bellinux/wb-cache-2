5|$|The {{length of}} the {{peninsula}} makes accurate weather prediction difficult for the town; when driving down Melody Line, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> find it sunny between one set of tunnels, rainy between another, and foggy between yet another. Ikata's position, stretching out into the ocean, also makes it a frequent target for typhoons.|$|E
5|$|Registered daffodils {{are given}} a {{division}} number and colour code such as 5W-W ('Thalia'). In horticultural usage <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> also find another unofficial division of 'Miniatures', which, although drawn from the other 13 divisions, have their miniature size in common. These are sometimes referred to by nurseries as 'Division 14'. Over 140 narcissus cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.|$|E
5|$|Quolls are {{carnivorous}} marsupials. They {{are primarily}} nocturnal, sleeping in hollowed-out logs or rocky dens and {{coming out to}} hunt during the night, though on rare occasions they can be seen looking for prey during the day. They are mostly ground-dwelling, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> see a quoll climbing a tree. Quolls mark their territory several kilometres away from their dens. A male's territory often overlaps many females' territories, and male and female quolls only meet for mating. Quolls have communal toilet areas, usually on an outcropping used for marking territory and social functions. These communal latrines may have up to 100 droppings in them.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the world, {{different}} seasoning {{and spices}} {{are used to}} augment the flavor of fried chicken. Because of the versatility of fried chicken, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> flavor the chicken's crisp exterior {{with a variety of}} spices ranging from spicy to savory. Depending on regional market ubiquity, local spice variations may be labeled as distinct from traditional Southern U.S. flavors, or may appear on menus without notation. With access to chickens suitable for frying broadening on a global scale with the advent of industrialized poultry farming, many localities have added their own mark on fried chicken, tweaking recipes to suit local preferences.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the highly}} skilled nature {{required}} for playing the agung, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> see agung players have friendly rivalries during a performance, using tricks {{in an attempt to}} throw others off-beat. For instance, if the p’nanggisa’s elaborations are so elusive that the p’mals has a hard time ornamenting or if the reversed happens and the p’mals ornaments to the point the p’nanggisa’s performance is engulfed, the player that cannot keep up is usually embarrassed, becoming the butt of jokes. Normally agung players switch off after each piece, but during instances like this where one player cannot handle the part being played, players either remain at their gongs or switch during the performance. It is also possible for agung players to switch places with the dabakan after two pieces. Even though the players compete, they still understand they are a single entity, closely accompanying the melody, employ different variations without destroying the music’s basic patterns.|$|E
5|$|The {{large number}} of {{instruments}} that some bands rely on in recording their studio albums can be a hindrance for live performances. While Orphaned Land are able to perform onstage with twenty musicians in their homeland of Israel, they {{have to rely on}} a computer to replicate the roles of the guest musicians for concerts elsewhere. Some folk metal acts confine themselves to studio recordings and are not known to perform any live concerts. This includes Folkearth, and Falkenbach. Other folk metal bands expand their regular roster to include more musicians and consequently, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> find bands in the genre featuring six or more members in their line-up. Some of the sextets in the genre are Schandmaul, Cruachan, Korpiklaani, Turisas, and Midnattsol, while septets include Ithilien, Subway to Sally, In Extremo, and Lumsk. Both Silent Stream of Godless Elegy and Eluveitie boast eight members each while the line up of Mägo de Oz totals nine performers. Even when a band includes members dedicated to folk instruments, they might still rely on guest musicians to further enhance their sound. As an example, Lumsk added thirteen guest musicians to the band's seven members on their debut album Åsmund Frægdegjevar. At times, guest musicians are known to become full-fledged members of the band, {{as was the case in}} Skyforger and Turisas.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{the large}} size of the contrabass's strings, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> see players using plectra made from a leather shoe or boot heel.

25|$|Generally, {{the city}} is sunny during the year, but rain is fairly common during the spring and in the summer.
