5000|$|This {{is a major}} {{break with}} older ideas, because {{different}} detection events do not agree on {{the position of a}} photon. It must be emphasized, however, that whether localizability can be established is based only on an indirect deduction, the result of a statistical analysis, which expresses the deviation for the detection. Localizability is therefore not an immediate fact by which an object can be described simply as a point mass condensed at a spot in space. Instead, it is seen to depend largely on a purely conventional means of taking into account the deviation of the detected signals. This convention seems natural to our common sense, but it leads to unambiguous results — a definite position for a physical object — only in cases where Newtonian mechanics is a good approximation.

This result is motivated by the recent developments on the non-equilibrium stationary measures by Derrida et al. (J. Statist.
