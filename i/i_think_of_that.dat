Due to the [...] "quality of entries", 20 entries were deemed winners in the end, and their creators received a [...] "Good Game T-Shirt for their outstanding efforts and unique ideas". However, Troy received a gaming console as his prize. As part of the Good Game Game competition, two internships at Infinite Interactive were offered to the entrants. The 20 winners were interviewed by the panel {{for one of the}} internships, with Zac Duff being named the final winner of the prize. He started at the company in August that year and worked on Office Wars. Phase 2 involved Good Game setting up 4 tasks, which sought viewers' [...] "ideas on how we should start to shape the game". Tasks included things like naming the corporation and its type of business, and naming the 5 statistics and skills of the player. The top ideas were chosen by the GG team, and voted on in the Good Game forum. Six people were awarded console prizes for their efforts. Timothy Randall, one of the 6 winners, was named the winner of the 2nd internship for Infinite Interactive in this phase. Phase 3 involved coming up with the company logo design, the company's corporate website design, the title music track for the game, and the game's backstory: the history of Wagglemax company & the corporate profiles of the characters. Good Game added a series of [...] "great exercises and tips taken from the Creativity Boot Camp session at the 2008 Game Developers Conference" [...] in order to encourage creativity and inspiration. The entire 90-page Game Design word document is available on the show's website, as is both the game's trailer and a download link for the prototype. Blender was used for [...] "all of the environment work", {{as well as some of}} the 3D model animations. Steve Fawkner, CEO Infinite Interactive said, [...] "Office Wars is one of those ideas that just makes you say 'why didn't <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> before?' It contains that wonderful mix of novelty, familiarity and inspiration that we were hoping to find in the Good Game Game project.".|$|E
