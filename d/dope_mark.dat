40|$|The {{strongly}} interacting Hubbard {{model on}} the square lattice is reduced to the low energy Plaquette Boson Fermion Model (PBFM). The four bosons (an antiferromagnon triplet and a d-wave hole pair), and the fermions are defined by the lowest plaquette eigenstates. We apply the Contractor Renormalization method of Morningstar and Weinstein to compute the boson effective interactions. The range- 3 truncation error {{is found to be}} very small, signaling short hole-pair and magnon coherence lengths. The pair-hopping and magnon interactions are comparable, which explains the rapid destruction of antiferromagnetic order with emergence of superconductivity, and validates a key assumption of the projected SO(5) theory. A vacuum crossing at larger <b>doping</b> <b>marks</b> a transition into the overdoped regime. With hole fermions occupying small Fermi pockets and Andreev coupled to hole pair bosons, the PBFM yields several testable predictions for photoemmission, tunneling asymmetry and entropy measurements.

However, her performance did not stand as she had failed an out-of-competition drug test in early December, two weeks before the event. She received a four-year ban from competition for her use of stanozolol (a performance-enhancing steroid. Her ban came at a time when numerous Romanian athletes were punished for <b>doping</b> infractions, <b>marking</b> a determined effort by Iolanda Balaş, the president of the Romanian Athletics Federation (FRA), to clean up the national athletics scene. In spite of this, the FRA opted to give Olteanu a two-year ban for her failed test, superseding the longer four-year ban set in place by the International Association of Athletics Federations. She became eligible for competition again in December 1998.|$|R
40|$|AbstractRecent {{experimental}} studies argued that, if carefully annealed, electron-doped (n-type) cuprates become superconducting (SC) in non-doped {{as well as}} weakly <b>doped</b> samples, in <b>marked</b> contrast to the conventional recognition. This metallic (SC) behavior {{is not likely to}} be understood by means of the t-J or Hubbard models, because their ground states at half filling are insulating with antiferromagnetic (AF) orders, even for moderately frustrated cases. Thus, we systematically study a d-p model including in-plain oxygen-p and copper-d orbitals, using a variational Monte Carlo method with refined correlation factors. It is found that an AF order becomes robust as charge transfer gap Δ or coulomb interaction on Cu sites Ud becomes large. As O-to-O hopping integral t′ becomes large, the AF ordered state tends to be unstable...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the structural and magnetic phase transitions in EuTi 1 -xNbxO 3 with synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS), and magnetization measurements. Upon Nb-doping, the Pm- 3 m to I 4 /mcm structural transition shifts to higher temperatures {{and the room}} temperature lattice parameter increases while {{the magnitude of the}} octahedral tilting decreases. In addition, Nb substitution for Ti destabilizes the antiferromagnetic ground state of the parent compound and long range ferromagnetic order is observed in the samples containing more than 10 % Nb. The structural transition in pure and <b>doped</b> compounds is <b>marked</b> by a step-like softening of the elastic moduli in a narrow temperature interval near TS, which resembles that of SrTiO 3 and can be adequately modeled using the Landau free energy model employing the same coupling between strain and octahedral tilting order parameter as previously used to model SrTiO 3.

40|$|Abstract. From {{analysis}} of the in-plane resistivity ρab(T) of La 2 −xSrxCuO 4, we show that normal state transport in overdoped cuprates can be delineated into two regimes in which the electrical resistivity varies approximately linearly with temperature. In the low temperature limit, the T-linear resistivity extends over a very wide <b>doping</b> range, in <b>marked</b> contrast to expectations from conventional quantum critical scenarios. The coefficient of this T-linear resistivity scales with the superconducting transition temperature Tc, implying that the interaction causing this anomalous scattering is also associated with the superconducting pairing mechanism. At high temperatures, the coefficient of the T-linear resistivity is essentially doping independent beyond a critical doping pcrit = 0. 19 at which {{the ratio of the}} two coefficients is maximal. Taking our cue from earlier thermodynamic and photoemission measurements, we conclude that the opening of the normal state pseudogap at pcrit is driven by the loss of coherence of anti-nodal quasiparticles at low temperatures...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} doping in the {{two-dimensional}} Hubbard model is studied within finite temperature exact diagonalization combined with cluster dynamical mean field theory. By employing a mixed basis involving cluster sites and bath molecular orbitals for {{the projection of}} the lattice Green's function onto 2 x 2 clusters, a considerably more accurate description of the low frequency properties of the self-energy is achieved than in a pure site picture. The transition from Fermi-liquid to non-Fermi-liquid behavior for decreasing hole doping is studied {{as a function of}} Coulomb energy, next-nearest neighbor hopping, and temperature. In particular, the self-energy component Sigma_X associated with X=(pi, 0) is shown to exhibit an onset of non-Fermi-liquid behavior as the hole doping decreases below a critical value delta_c. The imaginary part of Sigma_X(omega) then develops a collective mode above E_F, which exhibits a distinct dispersion with doping. Accordingly, the real part of Sigma_X(omega) has a positive slope above E_F, giving rise to an increasing particle-hole asymmetry as the system approaches the Mott transition. This behavior is consistent with the removal of spectral weight from electron states close to E_F and the opening of a pseudogap which increases with decreasing doping. The phase diagram reveals that delta_c = 0. 15 [...] . 0. 20 for various system parameters. For electron doping, the collective mode of Sigma_X(omega) and the concomitant pseudogap are located below the Fermi energy which is consistent the removal of spectral weight from hole states just below E_F. The critical <b>doping</b> which <b>marks</b> the onset of non-Fermi-liquid behavior, is systematically smaller than for hole doping. Comment: 18 pages, 21 figure...|$|R

40|$|We have {{observed}} that a change in bulk sulfur (S) content imposed by <b>doping</b> has a <b>marked</b> effect on ductility of copper shaped-charge jets as measured by breakup times and length-to-diameter ratios of the particulated jet. Baseline material was Oxygen-Free-Electronic (ofe) copper with a S concentration of 3 - 4 ppM. Several liners were doped using a Cu sulfide powder pack method to increase the S level up to 9 ppM, while keeping other impurities and microstructure unchanged. Using flash x-ray radiographs to record the formation of jets, both the length-to-diameter ratios of the jet particles and breakup times were measured. Increasing the bulk S content of ofe Cu to 9 ppM, the breakup times decreased from 186 to 147 {mu}s, while the length-to- diameter ratios observed at 260 {mu}s decreased from 8 : 1 to 5 : 1. Since the solubility of S in Cu at the processing temperatures is extremely low, we conclude that the bulk rise in S content is due to S segregating to the grain boundaries. Thus, the decrease in ductility of liners doped with S appears {{directly related to the}} S content at the grain boundaries...|$|R
40|$|The {{phase diagram}} of a {{correlated}} material {{is the result}} of a complex interplay between several degrees of freedom, providing a map of the material's behavior. One can understand (and ultimately control) the material's ground state by associating features and regions of the phase diagram, with specific physical events or underlying quantum mechanical properties. The phase diagram of the newly discovered iron arsenic high temperature superconductors is particularly rich and interesting. In the AE(Fe 1 -xTx) 2 As 2 class (AE being Ca, Sr, Ba, T being transition metals), the simultaneous structural/magnetic phase transition that occurs at elevated temperature in the undoped material, splits and is suppressed by carrier doping, the suppression being complete around optimal doping. A dome of superconductivity exists with apparent equal ease in the orthorhombic / antiferromagnetic (AFM) state as well as in the tetragonal state with no long range magnetic order. The question then is what determines the critical doping at which superconductivity emerges, if the AFM order is fully suppressed only at higher doping values. Here we report evidence from angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) that critical changes in the Fermi surface (FS) occur at the <b>doping</b> level that <b>marks</b> the onset of superconductivity. The presence of the AFM order leads to a reconstruction of the electronic structure, most significantly the appearance of the small hole pockets at the Fermi level. These hole pockets vanish, i. e. undergo a Lifshitz transition, at the onset of superconductivity. Superconductivity and magnetism are competing states in the iron arsenic superconductors. In the presence of the hole pockets superconductivity is fully suppressed, while in their absence the two states can coexist. Comment: Updated version accepted in Nature Physic...|$|R
