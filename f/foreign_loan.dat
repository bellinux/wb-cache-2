25|$|On 24 August 1854, {{during the}} Crimean War, the Ottoman Empire took its first foreign loans. The empire entered into {{subsequent}} loans, partly {{to finance the}} construction of railways and telegraph lines, and partly to finance deficits between revenues and the lavish expenditures of the imperial court, such as {{the construction of new}} palaces on the Bosphorus strait in Constantinople. Some financial commentators have noted that the terms of these loans were exceptionally favourable to the British and French banks (owned by the Rothschild family) which facilitated them, whereas others have noted that the terms reflected the imperial administration's willingness to constantly refinance its debts. A large amount of money was also spent for building new ships for the Ottoman Navy during the reign of Sultan Abdülaziz (r. 1861–1876). In 1875, the Ottoman Navy had 21 battleships and 173 warships of other types, which formed the third largest naval fleet in the world after those of the British and French navies. All of these expenditures, however, put a huge strain on the Ottoman treasury. In the meantime, a severe drought in Anatolia in 1873 and flooding in 1874 caused famine and widespread discontent {{in the heart of the}} empire. The agricultural shortages precluded the collection of necessary taxes, which forced the Ottoman government to declare a sovereign default on its <b>foreign</b> <b>loan</b> repayments on 30 October 1875 and increase taxes in all of its provinces, including the Balkans.|$|E

[...] The new Soviet government insisted that if the AYA suspended relief, the ARA arrange a <b>foreign</b> <b>loan</b> for them of about $10,000,000 1923 dollars; the ARA was unable to do this, and continued to ship in food past the grain being sold abroad.|$|E

2500|$|Chinese {{characters}} are primarily morphosyllabic, meaning that most Chinese morphemes are monosyllabic and are written {{with a single}} character, though in modern Chinese most words are disyllabic and dimorphemic, consisting of two syllables, {{each of which is}} a morpheme. In modern Chinese 10% of morphemes only occur as part of a given compound. However, a few morphemes are disyllabic, some of them dating back to Classical Chinese. Excluding <b>foreign</b> <b>loan</b> words, these are typically words for plants and small animals. They are usually written with a pair of phono-semantic compound characters sharing a common radical. Examples are 蝴蝶 húdié [...] "butterfly" [...] and 珊瑚 shānhú [...] "coral". Note that the 蝴 hú of húdié and the 瑚 hú of shānhú have the same phonetic, 胡, but different radicals ("insect" [...] and [...] "jade", respectively). Neither exists as an independent morpheme except as a poetic abbreviation of the disyllabic word.|$|E

[...] As a way out, Mustapha Khaznadar proposed that Sadok Bey take out the country's first ever <b>foreign</b> <b>loan.</b> Accordingly, on 6 May 1863, he concluded a loan with the French banker Erlanger {{in the amount of}} 35m francs. [...] However by the time various intermediariesincluding Mustapha Khaznadar himselfhad extracted their fees from the gross amount, only 5,640,914 was ultimately paid over to the Bey's Treasury.

The proportion was estimated from a sample calculation to amount to 17% of the <b>foreign</b> <b>loan</b> words and words from regional forms of English. Many of these had only a single recorded usage, but it ran against what was thought to be the established OED editorial practice and a perception that he had opened up the dictionary to [...] "World English".|$|E

With no other recourse, Sadok Bey was persuaded by Khaznadar to take out yet another <b>foreign</b> <b>loan,</b> on which Khaznadar once again made {{substantial}} commissions. [...] As Nassim Shamama had fled in June 1864, the following month a loan of 5m francs was arranged with a Jewish financier named Morpurgo from Alexandria, of which only 0.5m {{found their way to}} the treasury. A new contract was signed with the Erlanger Bank on 1 November 1864 for 15m francs guaranteed by customs revenues. A further 10m francs was subscribed several weeks later by the Oppenheim Bank, guaranteed by the tax on olive trees. As loan after loan was subscribed on terms very favourable to lenders, the Paris market was euphoric, and loans to Tunisia as well as to Egypt and the Ottoman Empire were known as “turban securities.” The newspapers carried upbeat accounts of the commercial opportunities. As the Tunisian economy collapsed, La Semaine financière wrote of the 1865 loan: “Today, the Bey of Tunis is under the moral protection of France, which takes an interest in the Tunisian people’s prosperity, since this prosperity also implies Algeria’s safety”.|$|E

60|$|As Washington beheld one hostile {{armament}} {{after another}} winging {{its way to}} the South, and received applications from that quarter for assistance, which he had not the means to furnish, it became painfully apparent to him, that the efforts to carry on the war had exceeded the natural capabilities of the country. Its widely diffused population, and the composition and temper of some of its people, rendered it difficult to draw together its resources. Commerce was almost extinct; there was not sufficient natural wealth on which to found a revenue; paper currency had depreciated through want of funds for its redemption until it was nearly worthless. The mode of supplying the army by assessing a proportion of the productions of the earth, had proved ineffectual, oppressive, and productive of an alarming opposition. Domestic loans yielded but trifling assistance. These considerations Washington was continually urging upon the attention of Congress in his full and perspicuous manner; the end of which was to enforce his opinion that a <b>foreign</b> <b>loan</b> was indispensably necessary to a continuance of the war. His earnest counsels and entreaties were at length successful in determining Congress to seek aid both in men and money from abroad. Accordingly, on the 28th of December they commissioned Lieutenant-colonel John Laurens, special minister at the court of Versailles, to apply for such aid. The situation he had held, as aide-de-camp to the commander-in-chief, had given him an opportunity of observing the course of affairs, and acquainting himself with the wants and resources of the country; and he was instructed to confer with Washington, previous to his departure, as to the objects of his mission. Scarce had Colonel Laurens been appointed when a painful occurrence proved the urgent necessity of the required aid.|$|E
