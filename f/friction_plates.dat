25|$|A {{magnetic}} particle clutch {{is a special}} type of electromagnetic clutch which does not use <b>friction</b> <b>plates.</b> Instead, it uses a fine powder of magnetically susceptible material (typically stainless steel) to mechanically link an otherwise free wheeling disc attached to one shaft, to a rotor attached to the other shaft. The {{magnetic particle}} clutch was invented in 1947 by Ukrainian-American Jacob Rabinow.|$|E
50|$|One-way sprag {{clutches}} {{have also}} been used for the same purpose, but are generally not adjustable for disengagement force. Early Honda Shadow models used a design wherein a sprag clutch is connected to just half of the clutch <b>friction</b> <b>plates,</b> allowing the clutch to slip during heavy backloading sufficiently to prevent rear-wheel lockup, while still allowing moderate engine compression braking with the remaining <b>friction</b> <b>plates.</b>|$|E

50|$|Attached to the {{transaxle}} is a Power Transfer Unit (PTU), {{which is}} connected to a rear axle through a propeller shaft. The PTU also feeds torque through itself to the front axle. At the rear axle, torque was first sent through a viscous coupling before reaching the final drive gearset. This coupling contained <b>friction</b> <b>plates</b> and an oil just viscous enough so that pressure affected how many plates were connected and active (and therefore, how much power was being delivered to the rear wheels).|$|E

50|$|A {{torque limiter}} is an {{automatic}} device that protects mechanical equipment, or its work, from damage by mechanical overload. A torque limiter may limit the torque by slipping (as in a <b>friction</b> <b>plate</b> slip-clutch), or uncouple the load entirely (as in a shear pin). The action of a torque limiter is especially useful to limit any damage due to crash stops and jams.|$|R
50|$|Motorcycles {{typically}} {{employ a}} wet clutch with the clutch {{riding in the}} same oil as the transmission. These clutches are usually {{made up of a}} stack of alternating plain steel and <b>friction</b> <b>plates.</b> Some plates have lugs on their inner diameters that lock them to the engine crankshaft. Other plates have lugs on their outer diameters that lock them to a basket that turns the transmission input shaft. A set of coil springs or a diaphragm spring plate force the plates together when the clutch is engaged.|$|E
5000|$|For 1987, the {{push-button}} {{four-wheel drive}} {{system on the}} wagon was changed; a new Real-Time 4WD system featured an automatic viscous coupling unit that shifted power to the rear wheels automatically when needed. The coupling featured 67 individual <b>friction</b> <b>plates,</b> surrounded by a heat sensitive silicon oil, which would distribute power to the rear driveshaft when a difference in both front/rear wheels was present. [...] Real-Time 4WD models are recognizable by the charcoal grey center covers, covering the lug nuts which were exposed on FWD models.|$|E
50|$|The damping {{rate for}} {{frictional}} dampers {{has less than}} ideal behaviour for car suspension. An ideal suspension would offer more damping to greater suspension forces, with less damping at low speeds for a smoother ride. Frictional dampers though had a mostly constant rate. This was even greater when stationary, owing to stiction between stationary plates. For larger bumps the damping may even be reduced. This is particularly a problem for fast driving, when repeated high forces may cause the <b>friction</b> <b>plates</b> to heat up and lose their efficiency.|$|E
50|$|This type {{is similar}} to a <b>friction</b> <b>plate</b> clutch. Over-torque will cause the plates to slip. A simple example is found in a fixed-spool fishing reel, where the {{slipping}} torque is set by means of a large hand nut in order that the reel will turn and allow more line to unwind before the line breaks under the pull of a fish.|$|R

With {{the help}} of the {{orthogonal}} experiment and the friction-wear mechanism by car as the research object of the clutch driven platen <b>friction</b> <b>plate</b> of Chongqing Changan CX 20 auto power take-off installation, the optimization of clutch friction materials is studied.

It was analyzed for the abrasion mechanism of the clutch driven platen <b>friction</b> <b>plate</b> between the flywheel and the pressure plate,and discussed for the relationship of driven platen friction-plate heat recession-performance and the driven plate material at high temperature. The results show that the friction factor of the optimized driven platen lining materials do not change.

50|$|A {{standard}} tuned {{mass damper}} for wind turbines consists of an auxiliary mass which {{is attached to the}} main structure by means of springs and dashpot elements. The natural frequency of the {{tuned mass damper}} is basically defined by its spring constant and the damping ratio determined by the dashpot. The tuned parameter of the tuned mass damper enables the auxiliary mass to oscillate with a phase shift with respect to the motion of the structure. In a typical configuration an auxiliary mass hung below the nacelle of a wind turbine supported by dampers or <b>friction</b> <b>plates.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{variant of}} the THM400 known as a THM375 is a THM400 with a long output shaft that mates to the smaller THM350 drive shaft yoke. It can be {{identified}} by [...] "375-THM" [...] cast into the tailhousing. Internally the clutch packs originally had fewer <b>friction</b> <b>plates.</b> THM375s were found in some 1971-76 Buicks. Some [...] "Heavy Duty" [...] THM350s were also designated THM375-B. Another variant is the 3L80HD, {{often referred to as}} a Turbo 475. The 3L80HD has a straight-cut planetary gear set. There is no externally visible way to determine whether the transmission contains the straight-cut planetary gear set. The THM425 front wheel drive transmission shares almost all its internal parts with the THM400. Checker Motors Corporation Motor Company used the Chevrolet version of the THM400 for its [...] "A" [...] series taxi and Marathon models until the end of production in 1982.|$|E
50|$|Above {{a certain}} engine speed - when the bike is {{properly}} in motion, so the gearbox input shaft is also rotating quickly and so allowing {{the engine to}} accelerate further by way of clutch slip - the outward pressure of the weighted <b>friction</b> <b>plates</b> is sufficient that the clutch will enter full lock-up, {{the same as a}} conventional plate-clutch with a fully released lever or pedal. After this, there is no clutch slip, and the engine is locked to and providing all of its available power to the transmission; engine rpm is now dependent on the road speed and the current gear ratio (under either user control in a semi-auto, or reliant on road speed (and sometimes load/throttle position) in a CVT setup). In a typical CVT, the gear ratio will be chosen so the engine can reach and maintain its maximum-power speed as soon as possible (or at least, when at full throttle, in a partially load-dependent system), but in a semi-auto the rider is responsible for this choice, and they can ride around all day in top gear (or first) if they so prefer. Also, when the engine is turning fast enough to lock the clutch, it will stay fully engaged until the RPMs fall below that critical point again, even if the throttle is fully released. Below the lock-up point, partially or fully releasing the throttle can lead to the RPM falling off rapidly, thanks to the feedback loop of lower engine speed meaning less friction pressure. This toggle-like mode of operation can lead to certain characteristic centrifugal-clutch-automatic behaviour, such as being able to freewheel rapidly downhill from a standstill, with engine braking only being triggered by turning the throttle briefly (and not then cancellable without braking to quite a slow, gear-dependent pace), and lockup triggering at a lower speed with full versus minimal throttle.|$|E
