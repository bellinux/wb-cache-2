[...] One editor, highlighting the technical simplicity of Lawson's recipes, noted that [...] "her dishes require none of the elaborate preparation called for by most TV chefs".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the BBC, Benz described Darla as strong: [...] "I have an amazing stunt double, Lisa Hoyle who looks exactly like me. She’s just brilliant and fearless and she does about 90 per cent of the stunts. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>part</b> of the element of Darla is how strong she is and how fierce she can be and Lisa definitely adds to that element. I would be a doing huge disservice to Darla if I didn’t allow her to do the work that she does and to help add to that element that’s so important to Darla, which is her strength." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 2014, Kreisberg {{described}} the episodes as {{very important to}} both Barry and Oliver {{and what they are}} going thorough, while also promising [...] "one of the biggest surprises for Arrow of all time in The Flash episode". Guggenheim added, [...] "It's like the bomb underneath the table, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>part</b> of the fun is waiting to see when Oliver is going to learn what the audience learns on Flash." [...] It was later announced that another secret would be revealed in the final moments of The Flash episode that will help [...] "introduce the next phase of The Flash in a big way". In the episode, Oliver runs into an ex-girlfriend, last seen pregnant with his child in season two of Arrow and had been told by Oliver's mother Moira to tell him that she'd lost the baby and disappear. It is revealed to the viewers that she has a child and it's presumed to be Oliver's. After the airing of the episode, Guggenheim confirmed that indeed it was Oliver's child. At the end of the episode, Robbie Amell, who played Ronnie Raymond—Caitlin's former fiancée presumed dead after the particle accelerator explosion—appears as Firestorm using his powers.|$|E
6000|$|Certainly <b>I</b> <b>think</b> some <b>part</b> of me {{must have}} been saying in the train: [...] "Leave go of her. Get away from her. End this now." [...] I can't have been so stupid as not to have had that in my mind....|$|R
50|$|As for why so {{many people}} still resist what the facts clearly show, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> in <b>part,</b> {{the reason is that the}} truth about the climate crisis is an {{inconvenient}} one that means we are going to have to change the way we live our lives.|$|R

2500|$|With his clipped speech, cool {{smile and}} a {{cigarette}} dangling impudently from his lips, Laurence Harvey established himself as the screen's perfect pin-striped cad. He could project such utter boredom that willowy debutantes would shrivel in his presence. He could also exude such charm that the same young ladies would gladly lend him their hearts, which were usually returned utterly broken... The image Mr Harvey carefully fostered for himself off screen was not far removed {{from some of the}} roles he played. [...] "I'm a flamboyant character, an extrovert who doesn't want to reveal his feelings", he once said. [...] "To bare your soul to the world, I find unutterably boring. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>part</b> of our profession is to have a quixotic personality." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nkrumah {{returned}} to London in May 1945 and {{enrolled at the}} London School of Economics as a PhD candidate in anthropology. He withdrew after one term {{and the next year}} enrolled at University College, with the intent to write a philosophy dissertation on [...] "Knowledge and Logical Positivism". His supervisor, A. J. Ayer, declined to rate Nkrumah as a [...] "first-class philosopher", saying, [...] "I liked him and enjoyed talking to him but he did not seem to me to have an analytical mind. He wanted answers too quickly. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>part</b> of the trouble may have been that he wasn't concentrating very hard on his thesis. It was a way of marking time until the opportunity came for him to return to Ghana." [...] Finally, Nkrumah enrolled in, but did not complete, a study in law at Gray's Inn.|$|E
2500|$|The band {{expected}} a less personal {{treatment for the}} film and were at times uncomfortable with {{the extent to which}} Guggenheim probed into their history. Responding to the band's concerns, Guggenheim said, [...] "I tell the story that's in front of me, warts and all. In the rock 'n' roll business, it's about adding layers. My process strips layers away. Rock stars are more comfortable creating an aura and mystique." [...] Despite U2's discomfort, they allowed Guggenheim to have creative control over the film. He remarked, [...] "They said from the beginning, we want you to make the movie that you want to make and they let me make the movie I wanted to make. It was pretty astounding. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>part</b> of it is the trust we gained doing It Might Get Loud, they sort of let me have a free hand." [...] Bono said that it was the least involved the band had ever been in a U2 project. Additional filming took place on 27 May at Burton Cummings Theatre in Winnipeg during the band's rehearsals for the Glastonbury Festival 2011. A rough cut of the movie was shown to the group in July, much to their satisfaction. According to Guggenheim, [...] "They were over the moon. They loved it." [...] The only request the band made was that the film should be shortened in length, and Guggenheim agreed.|$|E

"I think we're all radio-heads {{as well as}} music-heads, so there's a part of us that doesn't want to see {{radio as}} a medium die. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that's <b>part</b> of what we're doing, trying to reinvigorate people's passion for radio and trust in it as a medium where they can find out about music." ...|$|R

"No," [...] said Tom, {{stepping}} into the boat; [...] "I fear the man is drowned; he was carried down the Ripple, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> when <b>part</b> of the Mill fell with the crash of trees and stones against it; I've shouted again and again, {{and there has been}} no answer. Give me the oars, Maggie." ...|$|R

5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>part</b> of {{what made}} me a comedy writer is the {{blocking}} out {{of some of the}} really ugly, painful things in my childhood and covering it up with a humorous attitude ... do something to laugh until I was able to forget what was hurting.|$|E
5000|$|My {{family was}} very shy with {{feelings}} and never spoke about them, but we evolved a little bit. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>part</b> {{of the reason}} I was attracted to theater was because I wanted {{to be close to}} stories because they could help me relate to my family.|$|E
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> the fun <b>part</b> {{comes with}} {{coming up with}} ideas and characters. The hardest part for me is still {{learning}} how to draw well. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> there have been any easy parts of designing for me.|$|R

5000|$|About the {{concluding}} of this action film period, Voss said: [...] "Roundabout '97, the Asian market collapsed for action movies. And now <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>part</b> {{of the problem}} is all the DV films. There's more movies now than ever, and competition for the entertainment dollar. These movies aren't recouping the way they used to." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} in 2017, she said she doubted for her worth as a singer: <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>part</b> of what sparked my panic attacks was not feeling confident enough to believe in myself … I told myself that this was exactly where I {{was supposed to be}} and if other people believed in me, I had to start believing in myself.|$|E
5000|$|Squerciati {{liked her}} character's [...] "energy and happiness" [...] and said, [...] "I'm hoping that she {{maintains}} {{some of that}} joy. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>part</b> of it is because she's green, but another {{part of it is}} because she's a driven, joyful person. She knows what she wants." [...] Squerciati liked that Burgess was not the perfect officer and made mistakes, as she found it very relatable.|$|E
30|$|Yes. Absolutely. <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> and <b>part</b> of {{that vision}} is {{the vision of}} excellence, I guess and that, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> is really the real challenge. You know, you always have the {{percentage}} of instructors that are really excited about what they’re doing, and really engaged, {{and then you have}} a group that, you know, they go in, they do their job, but that’s it. And to engage them in—in being more proactive to engage the students and get the students involved, that’s the challenge, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> the {{economic}} arguments are clear. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> being <b>part</b> of a 500-million trading bloc is significant for us. <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> as <b>I</b> {{was saying to}} you a little earlier, {{that one of the}} issues {{is that a lot of}} people will invest here in the UK because it is the UK in Europe. If we were not in Europe, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> there would be firms and companies who would be looking to say, do they need to develop a mainland Europe presence rather than a UK presence? So <b>I</b> <b>think</b> there are definite benefits for us in economic terms.|$|R

50|$|I {{will say}} that I'm not, I don't want to sound that like I'm anti-drug, because I'm not anti-drug. I {{happen to be a}} drug addict. And when I take a drug, I can't stop. And um, or if I have a drink, I {{continue}} drinking until I black out. So, I had to stop. But, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>part</b> of {{that has to do with}} my, perhaps my environment, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> a great deal of it has to do with genetic physical causes.|$|R

6000|$|Last night I saw “Lord Dundreary.” <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it—the <b>part</b> and the [...] player, not the play—quite admirable.

My face became with laughing [...] like what Falstaff says he will make Prince Henry’s face, “like a [...] wet cloak ill laid up”(74) (Phillimore).|$|R
5000|$|... "Whatever {{happened}} - and I didn't see it - <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>part</b> of {{what did}} happen is he hit the ground and his head hit the cricket pitch...

[...] "St Kilda's Jim O'Dea received a 10-match suspension for the incident, but Peter McKenna recalls that the initial fear as Greening's teammates ran towards their prostrate young wingman was that they would find him dead." ...|$|E

5000|$|Actress Lee Grant, {{who acted}} {{with him and}} later filmed a {{documentary}} about him and his family, notes that even after he achieved worldwide stardom, his father would not acknowledge his success. He said [...] "nothing. Ever." [...] Douglas's wife, Anne, similarly attributes his tough childhood to the energy he devotes to acting: He was reared by {{his mother and his}} sisters and as a schoolboy he had to work to help support the family. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>part</b> of Kirk's life has been a monstrous effort to prove himself and gain recognition in the eyes of his father... Not even four years of psychoanalysis could alter the drives that began as a desire to prove himself.|$|E
