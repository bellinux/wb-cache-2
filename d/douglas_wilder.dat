5|$|The Civil Rights Movement gained many {{participants}} in the 1960s. It achieved the moral force and support to gain passage of national legislation with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In 1964 the United States Supreme Court ordered Prince Edward County and others to integrate schools. In 1967, the Court also struck down the state's ban on interracial marriage with Loving v. Virginia. From 1969 to 1971, state legislators under Governor Mills Godwin rewrote the constitution, after goals such as the repeal of Jim Crow laws had been achieved. In 1989, <b>Douglas</b> <b>Wilder</b> became the first African American elected as governor in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{uncertainty}} in forecasting when and if Emily would make its northeast turn, Virginia Governor <b>Douglas</b> <b>Wilder</b> {{declared a state of}} emergency and put the National Guard on alert. In Virginia Beach, residents of seaside homes and low-lying areas were recommended to evacuate, while a mandatory evacuation was ordered for Tangier Island in the Chesapeake Bay. Residents in mobile homes and on campgrounds were also advised to seek shelter. At least 750people left their homes, 711 of whom resided in storm shelters. The Norfolk International Airport was closed for 13hours, and rail service was suspended. To the north, officials in Ocean City, Maryland, declared a phase-one emergency ahead of the storm; beaches were closed, and tourists were recommended to leave. About 100,000people evacuated from the coast of Maryland; 3,600 stayed in storm shelters. In Delaware, 892people used storm shelters after voluntarily evacuating. Beaches in New Jersey closed due to threatening waves. About 20,000people also evacuated from Fire Island, New York. Across the Atlantic coast, 33emergency shelters were opened in response to Emily, though most evacuees instead relied on hotels or the homes of friends and relatives to ride out the storm.|$|E

50|$|Camp Mills was {{expanded}} to a containment with wooden buildings for the accommodation {{of thousands of}} troops, who arrived from training camps across the United States. At Camp Mills the units waited until they could be scheduled for embarkation whereupon they would travel by trains of the Long Island Rail Road to board ferryboats for the overseas piers in Brooklyn or Hoboken and loaded onto troop ships. Those ships transported troops primarily to the ports of Liverpool, England, or Brest, France. Facilities at Camp Mills included a hospital, warehouses, bakery, delousing plant and other facilities. It eventually consisted of about 1,200 buildings with a capacity of 46,000, including space for 40,000 transients (about half in barracks, half in tents), a 500 inmate detention camp and 5,500 members of a permanent garrison. A {{very large number of}} American soldiers shipped out to France from Camp Mills, at its peak in September 1918, over 31,000 troops were stationed there. Notable individuals who were assigned during World War I were: <b>Douglas</b> MacArthur, <b>Wild</b> Bill Donovan, Joyce Kilmer and Father Duffy among them. F.

5000|$|Scholar Bruce Allen Murphy {{published}} a heavily-researched biography of <b>Douglas</b> in 2003, <b>Wild</b> Bill: The Legend and Life of William O. Douglas. [...] In it, {{he wrote that}} Douglas had long falsified much of his early life, including {{the nature of his}} childhood illness, the economic suffering of his family, his military service during World War I, and his performance at Columbia Law School. [...] James Ryerson, writing for The New York Times Book Review, accepted Murphy's conclusions and stated that, [...] "In his 1974 autobiography, Go East, Young Man, Douglas repeated many of these outright lies, introduced new ones and liberally embellished other key details of his life story." [...] However, another scholar working on a Douglas biography, David J. Danelski, {{as well as some of}} Douglas's past associates, said that while Douglas may have exaggerated at times, Murphy's biography had not proven the worst such incidences.|$|R
25|$|<b>Douglas</b> <b>Wilder</b> is {{the founder}} of the United States National Slavery Museum, a {{non-profit}} organization based in Fredericksburg, Virginia. The museum has been fundraising and campaigning since 2001 to establish a national museum on slavery in America.

From that time, taxes on the land had not been paid and the property was at risk of being sold at auction by the city of Fredericksburg.|$|E
25|$|After the {{successful}} performance by U.S. and coalition {{forces in the}} Persian Gulf War, President George H.W. Bush's approval ratings were 89%. His re-election was considered very likely. As a result, several high-profile candidates, such as Mario Cuomo, refused to seek the Democratic nomination. In addition, Senator Al Gore refused to seek the nomination {{due to the fact}} his son was struck by a car and was undergoing extensive surgery as well as physical therapy. However, Tom Harkin, Paul Tsongas, Jerry Brown, Bob Kerrey, <b>Douglas</b> <b>Wilder</b> and Bill Clinton chose to run as candidates.|$|E
25|$|From the 1920s to the 1960s, {{the state}} was {{dominated}} by the Byrd Organization, with dominance by rural counties aligned in a Democratic party machine, but their hold was broken over their failed Massive Resistance to school integration. After World War II, the state's economy thrived, with a new industrial and urban base. A statewide community college system was developed. The first U.S. African-American governor since Reconstruction was Virginia's <b>Douglas</b> <b>Wilder</b> in 1990. Since the late 20th century, the contemporary economy has become more diversified in high-tech industries and defense-related businesses. Virginia's changing demography makes for closely divided voting in national elections {{but it is still}} generally conservative in state politics.|$|E

It blooms in late April to early May. Habitat: Found in open woods of valleys, hills and mountains as well as meadows and rocky areas. Medicinal value: The bulb of this plant is edible and was a particular favorite of the Nez Perce Indians. It was eaten either raw or cooked and has a sweet, nutlike flavor.
