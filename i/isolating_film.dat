It is potentially possible to use graphene or graphene-polymer composite to make a wideband saturable absorber for laser mode locking. Furthermore, comparing with the SWCNTs, as graphene has a 2D structure it should have much smaller non-saturable loss and much higher damage threshold.

The physical and mechanical properties of the films were determined by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and tensile testing. Water vapor permeability (WVP) measurements revealed that the water vapor transmission rates are slightly influenced by sonication conditions and nanoparticle loading. The DMA results showed that, at high sonication levels, addition of nanoparticles prevented protein agglomeration. The thermal stability of the materials revealed the presence of 3 – 4 degradation stages in oxidizing the protein films. The addition of nanoparticles strengthens the WPI film, as evidenced by tensile stress analysis. Sonication improved nanoparticle distribution in film matrix; such films can potentially become effective packaging materials to enhance food quality and safety. D. M. Kadam, M. Thunga, S. Wang, M.

30|$|In {{order to}} analyse the aging {{characteristics}} of the nanocellulose and their effects on the molecular level, {{a part of the}} treated paper samples and <b>isolated</b> <b>films</b> of nanocelluoses were analysed after artificial aging in a closed vessel system (ASTM standard D 6819 - 02 e 3 [31, 32]) for 6 or 20  days. For the samples, the molar mass distribution and the carbonyl groups generated during aging were analysed [34, 35]. In this setup, the complete sample (10 – 20  mg total) was analysed after a carbonyl group derivatization step followed by dissolution and SEC–MALLS analysis. The BNC and NFC were thus analysed as part of the whole sample. However, the concentration of BNC and NFC respectively is clearly below 10 % and hence affects the overall molar mass only to a minor extent. In general, a standard deviation of 15 % has to be expected for the samples analysed, as they are either very high in molar mass (BNC) or not easy to dissolve (book paper sample and newsprint). In addition, the rag paper sample showed an exceptionally high inhomogeneity.|$|R
40|$|THESIS 7425 The {{focus of}} this thesis was to develop two {{products}} for use in agrochemical applications, using the naturally occurring microtubular mineral, halloysite.

The halloysite samples were characterised using a number of techniques such as scanning electron microscopy.

Various physical and chemical clean up procedures were applied to the mineral to remove debris and increase the proportion of intact tubules.

The kinetics of pectin leaching from the mixed films, incubated in 0. 05 M acetate-phosphate buffer (pH 4. 5, 37 °C) {{in the absence of}} pectinolytic enzymes, showed that pectin HM or calcium pectinates were quickly released from the different films except from the mixed pectin/Eudragit(®) RS films. Moreover, in these cases, the leaching of pectin from Eudragit(®) RS films containing up to 10 % w/w (related to Eudragit(®) RS polymer content) of pectin HM or pectin LM, was significantly faster in the presence of enzymes than in absence. These results indicate that the associations of pectin HM or LM and Eudragit RS are likely to give more suitable coating materials for colon-specific drug delivery than the other combinations.

Use of the flat-top laser beam profile should prevent inhomogeneity in ablation.

40|$|We present {{theoretical}} {{studies of}} the spin pumping contribution to the ferromagnetic resonance linewidth for various ultrathin film ferromagnetic structures. We consider the <b>isolated</b> <b>film</b> on a substrate, with Fe on Au(100) and Fe on W(110) as examples. We explore as well the linewidth from this mechanism for the optical and acoustical collective modes of FM/Cu_ N/FM/Cu(100) structures. The calculations employ a realistic electronic structure, with self consistent ground states generated from the empirical tight binding method, with nine bands for each material in the structure. The spin excitations are generated through use of the random phase approximation applied to the system, including the semi infinite substrate on which the structure is grown. We calculate the frequency response of the system directly by examining the spectral density associated with collective modes whose wave vector parallel to the surface is zero. Linewidths with origin in leakage of spin angular momentum from the adsorbed structure to the semi infinite substrate may be extracted from these results. We discuss a number of issues, including {{the relationship between the}} interfilm coupling calculated adiabatically for trilayers, and that extracted from the (dynamical) spin wave spectrum.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the anion-controlled drug release mechanism through the cationic coating polymer Eudragit RS 30 D as a function of the anion attraction toward the polymer’s quarternary ammonium group (QAG), anion valence, and film composition. The mechanism was investigated by dissolution testing, determination of chloride ion exchange using ion chromatography, plasticizer leaching by means of differential scanning calorimetry, and water uptake by Karl Fischer titration. All experiments were performed on coated theophylline micro tablets or <b>isolated</b> <b>films</b> of various compositions using 0. 01 M sodium nitrate, sodium sulfate, disodium succinate, sodium acetate, and succinic acid as dissolution media. The mechanism of drug release involved an immediate penetration of dissolution medium into the polymer followed by an instant exchange of chloride against the medium’s anion species at completely different rates compared with the drug release. Dependent on the attraction of the anion toward the QAGs, a water flux was induced by back and forth exchanging anions. Strong attraction (nitrate, sulfate) resulted in a low water flux while weak attraction resulted in a high flux (acetate, succinic acid). The water flux increased at increasing number of QAGs. Plasticizer acted as a diluent in respect of the number of QAGs, thus higher plasticizer concentrations led to lower drug release...|$|R

SpA molecules were partly squeezed out from the film by compression; a proteinless lipid film proved to be a condensed multilayer. Contact with SpA transformed the multilayer into a loose monomolecular film. It is suggested that SpA molecules play a lipid-transporting role, removing lipids in excess from the air-water interface into the aqueous subphase and vice versa.

40|$|Three {{bacterial}} isolates (Micrococcus sp., Rhodovulum sp., and Vibrio sp.) {{from natural}} biofilms were investigated for {{their effects on}} cyprid settlement of Balanus amphitrite in laboratory bioassays. The inhibitive effect of these bacteria was clearly demonstrated by using a choice assay, in which cyprids settled preferentially on surfaces without bacterial pretreatment over those possessing a monospecies bacterial film. This result suggested that the inhibitive effect was mediated by direct larval contact with bacterial film surface rather than the perception of diffusible bacterial products. In a no-choice assay, monospecies bacterial films of different cell densities reduced cyprid settlement in a density-dependent manner. Vibrio sp. was the most potent inhibitor among the three isolates as it effectively inhibited cyprid settlement by relatively low-density films. The cells of Vibrio sp. were the smallest among the three isolates, suggesting that the correlation between bacterial cell density and cyprid settlement might not be merely due to the reduction of free-space availability. For all three <b>isolates,</b> <b>films</b> that were killed by formaldehyde or UV treatment were as potent as untreated, live films.
