Organization has been {{identified}} as an important tool for improving the vulnerable position if female <b>home</b> based <b>workers.</b> The aim of this research is to get insight into the position in the value chain of female <b>home</b> based <b>workers</b> in the context of Kathmandu and Hetauda, Nepal, and to analyze how organization affects the position in the value chain of these female <b>home</b> based <b>workers</b> and their livelihood as a whole. It is found that the female <b>home</b> based <b>workers</b> in this study are part of a captive value chain, in which the buyers hold the power and control and in which the female <b>home</b> based <b>workers</b> are highly vulnerable and powerless, as they are women with little marketing skills and knowledge, and highly dependent on the work. It is argued that organization not only helps the female <b>home</b> based <b>workers</b> directly through access to savings and credit, awareness trainings, and the development of friendships, but also to increase their competence in the value chain through skill improvement, market knowledge, and collective bargaining. It might even lead to a change in chain governance from a captive towards a relational one, in which there is more trust and mutual dependence between producer and buyer. Furthermore, it is argued that organization is essential for creating an enabling environment for the <b>home</b> based <b>workers</b> to live and work. Advocating for more inclusive policies and government programs and working together with trade unions and NGOs can contribute significantly to this...|$|R

The requirement also stipulated the extent to which the technical standards established by national and international organisations can be regarded as “rules of the art.” In a directive of 10 November 1970, the Minister of Labour and Social Affairs recommended to the higher authorities for work protection of the [...] "Lander" [...] to bring in the directive published, in agreement with the Ministry of Labour, by the German Engineers' Association on the evaluation of work station noise in relation to loss of hearing, in order to improve safeguards for workers against the noises in question. In September 1971, an ordinance was published concerning dangerous working materials; safeguarding persons using these materials against the dangers involved. In August 1971, a law came into force directed at reducing atmospheric pollution from lead compounds in four-stroke engine fuels. As a safeguard against radiation, a decree on the system of authorisations for medicaments treated with ionizing radiation or containing radioactive substances, in its version of 8 August 1967, was remodelled by a new Decree of 10 May 1971 which added some radionuclides to the list of medicaments which doctors in private practice were authorized to use.|$|E

Questions: How does <b>home</b> care <b>workers</b> experience their daily work with their clients? <b>Home</b> care <b>workers</b> daily meet many different sorts of clients with different needs, how do they handle this? What kind of support does <b>home</b> care <b>workers</b> get in their work? Method: A qualitative design with semistructured interviews. Conclusion: The most central conclusion from all of our interviews were: that <b>home</b> care service <b>workers</b> has a very stressful and demanding occupation, that the work has a low status, that the personnel has a big responsibility for the wellbeing of other people and that they often find their work satisfying and fun. To have {{someone to talk to}} and exchange ideas with was also mentioned by the informants as a vital part of feeling support in their work.

40|$|Excerpt] In 2002 only a {{small number}} of Chinese <b>home</b> care <b>workers</b> {{represented}} by 1199 SEIU United Healthcare Workers East (UHE) were involved in their union. Language, unfamiliarity with unions in the United States, and, in some cases, undocumented immigration status inhibited participation in the life of the union by the growing number of Chinese <b>home</b> care <b>workers.</b> Despite these obstacles in 2007 perhaps the most active segment of the 60, 000 <b>home</b> care <b>workers</b> in 1199 SEIU now comes from the approximately 10, 000 Chinese <b>home</b> care <b>workers.</b> Today, Chinese <b>home</b> care <b>workers</b> are consistently overrepresented at union (not just home care) rallies and demonstrations and have helped organize several home care agencies, bringing significant numbers of additional Chinese workers into the union. Currently the Chinese <b>home</b> care <b>workers</b> are organizing retirees and expanding their involvement in the political life of their communities. Chinese <b>home</b> care <b>workers</b> have extended their activism into political participation in their communities and in the union 2 ̆ 7 s political program. Eighty to ninety percent of Chinese <b>home</b> care <b>workers,</b> who earn between 7 and 10 per hour and who cannot count on regular work contribute between 5 and 10 per month on top of their union dues to the union 2 ̆ 7 s political action committee, maybe the highest percentage in the union. What makes this turnaround particularly significant is the role education and training played in the organizing. In 2003, 1199, assisted by Cornell University labor educators, launched a series of two-day training sessions for home care union activists facilitated in Cantonese and Mandarin. Chinese home care activists trained as facilitators by 1199 led the training. To date the two-day activist training has been given thirteen times for over 700 Chinese <b>home</b> care <b>workers</b> who give up precious days to complete the training. Each new training session is eagerly awaited, and each new class has a waiting list of participants ready before it starts. Of those who have completed the activist training over 100 have attended additional training to become union delegates (stewards). This article will describe how the Chinese Activist Training was conceived, designed and presented...|$|R
