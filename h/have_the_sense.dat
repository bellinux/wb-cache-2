500|$|In retrospect, {{many members}} of the cast and crew felt that the season was not the show's best. Rainn Wilson said that the season made some {{mistakes}} [...] "creatively"; for instance, he argued that the chemistry between Spader and Helms was [...] "a bit dark" [...] and that the show should have gone for a [...] "brighter and more energized" [...] relationship. Brian Baumgartner felt that the show [...] "stayed status quo , but without a key piece" [...] and [...] "didn't make a firm decision" [...] on the direction it was headed. Ben Silverman, one of the show's producers, said that [...] "it didn't <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> of purpose and focus" [...] that the next season would have.|$|E
500|$|After Alberta's {{two most}} {{prominent}} Liberals, Peter Talbot and Frank Oliver, {{made it clear}} that they were not interested, DeVeber considered himself as a possible candidate. [...] Less than two months before Alberta's formal creation, he wrote to his colleague in the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories, Alexander Cameron Rutherford, that the possibilities [...] "practically came to you and I, both of us weak enough God knows but we <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> to see it." [...] DeVeber's belief that he may be appointed premier does not appear to have been well-founded: his opposition to the introduction of party lines earned him the enmity of some Liberals, not least because it aligned him with Haultain, a Conservative. [...] In the estimation of historian L. G. Thomas, DeVeber's fellow Liberals [...] "were not inclined to take him too seriously" [...] as a potential premier.|$|E
500|$|Other home {{versions}} were well-received for {{the most}} part, with some exceptions. Of the ColecoVision version, Electronic Fun with Computers & Games noted that [...] "Q*bert aficionados will not be disappointed". Marc Brownstein of Video Games called {{it one of the}} best of the authorized versions. Warren Davis also considered the ColecoVision version the most accurate port of the arcade. Mark Brownstein judged the Atari 5200 version inferior to the ColecoVision, due to the imprecision of the Atari 5200 controller, but noted that [...] "it does tend to grow on you." [...] Video Games determined the Intellivision version as the worst of the available ports, criticizing the system's controller for being inadequate for the game. Antic magazine's David Duberman called the Atari 8-bit version [...] "one of the finest translations of an arcade game for the home computer format", and Arthur Leyenberger of Creative Computing listed it as a runner-up for Best Arcade Adaptation to the system, praising its faithful graphics, sound, movement and playability. Softline was more critical, criticizing the Atari version's controls and lack of swearing. The magazine concluded that [...] "the home computer game doesn't <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> of style of the one in the arcades ... the execution just isn't there". In 1984 the magazine's readers named the game the fifth-worst Atari program of 1983. Computer Games called the C64 version an [...] "absolutely terrific translation" [...] that [...] "almost totally duplicates the arcade game," [...] aside from its lack of synthesized speech. The stand-alone tabletop was awarded Stand-Alone Game of the Year in Electronic Games.|$|E

2500|$|He commented about Labour parliamentarians under Hugh Gaitskell (opposition leader 1955–63) that, when {{offered their}} choice of weapons, they {{invariably}} chose boomerangs. It is said that Macleod was the only Conservative debater whom Harold Wilson, Gaitskell's successor as Labour leader, was afraid of. Wilson declared “they’ll never <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> to choose him [...]” He compared Wilson to a kipper, which has two faces. John Major specifically cited Macleod's example on taking office.|$|E
2500|$|Confucius's {{political}} thought {{is based upon}} his ethical thought. He argued that the best government is one that rules through [...] "rites" [...] (lǐ) and people's natural morality, and not by using bribery and coercion. He explained {{that this is one}} of the most important analects: [...] "If the people be led by laws, and uniformity sought to be given them by punishments, they will try to avoid the punishment, but have no sense of shame. If they be led by virtue, and uniformity sought to be given them by the rules of propriety, they will <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> of the shame, and moreover will become good." [...] (Translated by James Legge) in the Great Learning (...) [...] This [...] "sense of shame" [...] is an internalisation of duty, where the punishment precedes the evil action, instead of following it in the form of laws as in Legalism.|$|E
2500|$|Trueman was {{nevertheless}} respected for his unsurpassed {{knowledge of}} the mechanics of fast bowling, and many feel {{he should have been}} used as a bowling coach for England's under-achieving teams of the 1980s and 1990s, a point once emphasised by his fellow-summariser Trevor Bailey on Test Match Special. A good example of Trueman's coaching ability had occurred in 1975 when he was approached by the Australian fast bowler Dennis Lillee for help. Lillee was having trouble with both his run-up and bowling action, problems that Trueman had already observed and mentioned on the radio. Trueman gave Lillee the technical advice that provided the solution and Lillee was soon able to recover his form, though this was at the expense of England. Trueman received criticism from many people in the England camp for helping an Australian player, especially after Lillee publicly acknowledged his debt to Trueman. Bailey, on the other hand, completely rejected this criticism and said that the [...] "prima donnas" [...] of English cricket should also <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> to consult experts like Trueman.|$|E

2500|$|Fischer is {{a proponent}} of interreligious {{dialogue}} between the worlds' religions, stating: [...] "I feel that in our period it is the challenge of religious traditions {{to do something more}} than simply reassert and reinterpret their faiths, hoping for loyal adherents to what they perceive to be the true doctrine. Looking back at the last century, with its devastating wars and holocausts and the shock of ecological vulnerability, I <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> that religious traditions must now have a wider mission, and it is in the recognition of this mission, I believe, that interreligious dialogue becomes something not only polite and interesting, but also essential."He currently sits on the Board of World Religious Leaders for the Elijah Interfaith Institute, an interreligious dialogue organization. In July 1996, he attended a five-day meeting between members of different religions held at The Abbey of Our Lady of Gethsemani in Trappist, Kentucky, where he gave a talk about Dogen, zazen, and the importance of religions coming together—despite their different philosophies—to serve humanity. Fischer has participated in interreligious pilgrimages with Father Laurence Freeman OSB and the Dalai Lama.|$|E
2500|$|From 1936 to 1941, Dyson was a Scholar at Winchester College, {{where his}} father was Director of Music. On 25 July 1943, he entered the Operational Research Section (ORS) of the Royal Air Force’s Bomber Command, [...] where he {{developed}} analytical methods to help the Royal Air Force bomb German targets during the Second World War. After the war, Dyson was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he obtained a BA degree in mathematics. [...] From 1946 to 1949, he was a Fellow of his college, occupying rooms just below those of the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, who resigned his professorship in 1947. In 1947, he published two papers in number theory. Friends and colleagues describe Dyson as shy and self-effacing, with a contrarian streak that his friends find refreshing but his intellectual opponents find exasperating. [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> that when consensus is forming like ice hardening on a lake, Dyson will do his best to chip at the ice", Steven Weinberg said of him. His friend, the neurologist and author Oliver Sacks, said: [...] "A favorite word of Freeman's about doing science and being creative is the word 'subversive'. He feels it's rather important not only to be not orthodox, but to be subversive, and he's done that all his life." ...|$|E
2500|$|The phenomenalist {{phase of}} post-Humean {{empiricism}} ended by the 1940s, for {{by that time}} it had become obvious that statements about physical things could not be translated into statements about actual and possible sense data. [...] If a physical object statement is to be translatable into a sense-data statement, the former {{must be at least}} deducible from the latter. But it came to be realized that there is no finite set of statements about actual and possible sense-data from which we can deduce even a single physical-object statement. Remember that the translating or paraphrasing statement must be couched in terms of normal observers in normal conditions of observation. There is, however, no finite set of statements that are couched in purely sensory terms and can express the satisfaction of the condition of the presence of a normal observer. According to phenomenalism, to say that a normal observer is present is to make the hypothetical statement that were a doctor to inspect the observer, the observer would appear to the doctor to be normal. [...] But, of course, the doctor himself must be a normal observer. If we are to specify this doctor's normality in sensory terms, we must make reference to a second doctor who, when inspecting the sense organs of the first doctor, would himself have to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> data a normal observer has when inspecting the sense organs of a subject who is a normal observer. And if we are to specify in sensory terms that the second doctor is a normal observer, we must refer to a third doctor, and so on (also see the third man).|$|E
