For this therapy, the biocompatibility and viability of collagen foils as scaffolds for RPE-Cells in the subretinal space of rabbit eyes was evaluated. The series of experiments included a total of 12 animals with one operated eye each. ARPE- 19 cells were cultivated on collagen foils, which have been stained with the fluorescing dye DTAF. After accessing the operating area via pars plana vitrectomy, a bleb was created by subretinally injecting balanced salt solution. Using a retinotomy on the ablated retina, the collagen foil was transplanted into the subretinal space. The observation period varied between 3 to 35 days. The enucleated rabbit eyes were evaluated both macroscopically and microscopically. After processing the histological slices with paraffin, the morphological examination was done natively, by using fluorescing light and {{with the aid of}} HE-staining. Being easily dyeable with DTAF, the sheet proved to be sturdy before and after cultivation, as well as during cutting and transplanting. Postoperative, the transplanted sheets with ARPE- 19 showed minor to none degradation after 2 weeks. Partial degradation was detectable after 3 weeks, almost complete degradation after 5 weeks.

40|$|Optical filters {{have been}} {{developed}} for the X-ray astronomy project XMM (X-ray Multi Mirror Mission) [1] of ESA, where specific CCDs will serve as focal plane cameras on board the observatory. These detectors are sensitive from the X-ray to the NIR (near infrared) spectral region. For observations in X-ray astronomy an optical filter must be placed in front of the CCD, suppressing visible and UV (ultraviolet) radiation of stars by more than 6 orders of magnitude while being highly transparent at photon energies above 100 eV. The flight model filter is designed to have an effective area of 73 mm diameter without making use of a supporting grid.

Electrical and sometimes thermal interconnection between layers is realized through connecting holes (vias), which are filled with conductive material.

A few 100 up to mare than 100 000 holes with diameters ranging from 60 to 300 micron but usually around 100 micron depending on the specific application, have to be generated in 6 '' x 6 '' or 8 '' x 8 '' ceramic green sheets.

40|$|AbstractThe use of sheet molding {{compounds}} (SMC) {{in diverse}} applications requires different specific material properties {{for each type}} of finished parts. These material properties have to be assured by a reliable quality control, which does not only have to be performed for the prefabricated SMC itself but also during the production process of the semi-finished material. This is of high importance because quality fluctuations and defects can already occur during the production of the semi-finished SMC. This results in high scrap rates as well as machine failure and can additionally cause further problems in the following process steps. Hence, an inline quality control can help to establish objective quality criteria for semi-finished SMC and can enable controlled and stable production processes. Therefore, this paper deals with quality assurance in the production process of semi-finished sheet molding compounds. Air entrapping and fiber distribution are identified as two parameters that influence the quality of the semi-finished product significantly. In addition, the early detection of a pending <b>carrier</b> <b>foil</b> failure can help to establish a stable process. The focus of this paper lies on how various, individually adapted metrology systems can be used for the detection of the respective characteristics and integrated into the production process of the semi-finished SMC. In particular, optical systems, such as area scan cameras and laser stripe sensors as well as thermographic sensors are discussed and possibilities for application-related sensor data evaluation are shown.

40|$|The work {{described}} {{here has been}} {{the development of a}} technique for fabrication of absorber patterns made of tungsten. Highly adhesive low stress tungsten layers of several micrometer thickness have been made by magnetron sputtering and subsequently patterned by reactive ion etching. Then the titanium layer together with the tungsten patterns is transferred to a carrier frame. The advantages of the subtractive patterning process of a tungsten film include good adhesion, even of tiny absorber patterns, on the mask <b>carrier</b> <b>foil</b> and the homogeneous thickness of the absorber independent of the line width across the whole mask area. As the film is deposited and patterned under vacuum conditions, less defect density can be achieved. Using the substractive process absorber patterns of only 0. 5 #mu#m width have been fabricated which are 2 mm long and 2. 5 #mu#m in height. To achieve X-ray masks with small distortions of the absorber patterns tungsten films with little internal stresses must be prepared. Low stress tungsten films with isotropic stress distribution have been manufactured by rotation of the substrates during film application. Vertical absorber structures have been prepared by reactive ion etching with both CF_ 4 and SF_ 6 as etching gases. The addition of oxygen to the etching gases improves the selectivity of etching from tungsten to titanium so that {{there is no need for}} an additional etch stopping film. Nickel has been used as masking material in reactive patterning; it excels by minimum removal rates, especially in SF_ 6 etching in the range of high generator powers. (orig.) Dissertation of K.

40|$|Photovoltaic (PV) {{technology}} {{is one of}} the most promising ways to respond to the ever increasing worldwide energy demand without causing damages to the environment. Todays PV market is dominated by silicon solar cells that are manufactured from 180 &# 956;m-thick silicon substrates. With this technology, devices with 25 % conversion efficiency have been demonstrated but, to render the technology competitive with standard energy sources, the cost per Watt peak of silicon solar cells has to be further reduced. To achieve this reduction, researchers have suggested to utilize silicon substrates with thickness below 100 &# 956;m. The driving force for this thickness reduction is two-fold: on one hand, simulations have shown that it would lead to an increase of the efficiency; on the other hand, since the cost of bare silicon still accounts for almost 33 % of the final cost of the solar cell, it would lead to a decrease of the manufacturing costs. Unfortunately, employing thinner substrates comes along with important issues in the foil production and in the processing of the foils into solar cells. Firstly, the sawing technique, which is usually employed to fabricate silicon wafers from an ingot, would waste more than 50 % of the materials due to the wearing of the saw. Secondly, when the sawing technique is utilized for the production of very thin foils, the induced stresses can cause the breakage of the thin foils. Finally, the processing of thin solar cells is complicated by the foil fragility, low weight and mechanical flexibility, which render standard techniques unsuitable for their processing into solar cells. In this work, two techniques to manufacture thin silicon solar cells were analyzed: the SLiM-cut technique and the porous silicon (PS) -based layer transfer technique. With the former, the propagation of a crack in the silicon bulk is initiated and controlled by depositing a stress-inducing layer on top of it while, with the latter, a weak PS interface is first created to control the direction of the crack propagation. In the optimization of the SLiM-cut method, different stress-inducing layer were investigated and it was found that many materials may be utilized for initiating the propagation of a crack in the silicon bulk. Amongst them, it was argued that polymers seemed to be the best choice because of their low processing temperature and the possibility to find cleaning solutions. The detachment of 7 x 7 cm 2 samples was successfully demonstrated through the dispensing of an epoxy layer. The detachment surface was then analyzed by profilometry and it was highlighted the presence of a large roughness and thickness variation. Correlation of the crack patterns in different samples and the simulation of the crack propagation via a finite element model suggested that the origins of the crack corrugations were caused by the interaction of multiple crack fronts and the presence of dynamic effects. A solution to solve both problems was suggested. The optimization of the detachment in case of the PS-based layer transfer technique, instead, was tackled through a thorough characterization of the PS interface. This characterization concerned the morphology of the layer before, during and after the reorganization stage. The investigation led to the formulation of a new theory on the reorganization that takes into account the effect of the stress on the reorganization process on the morphology of the pores. In regions subjected to a larger stress field, the pores will exhibit a smaller radius after reorganization due to the additional contribution of the deformation energy to the total free energy. Furthermore, the effect of the HF depletion was identified as an important effect allowing the formation of more porous layers in case thicker PS layers were etched. Finally, a cohesive law to model the PS interface was proposed. This cohesive law can be used, in future study, to analyze the kind of loads a general PS interface can withstand without breaking and at which conditions the interface allows the detachment of the silicon foils. The quality of the foils produced with both methods was then investigated. It was shown in this work that both techniques can be employed for the fabrication of high efficiency silicon solar cells. 1 Introduction 1. 1 Photovoltaics technology 1. 2 Thin silicon solar cells 1. 3 Rationale of the thesis 1. 4 Outline of the thesis 2 Overview on fracture mechanics 2. 1 Introduction 2. 2 Dynamic crack propagation in silicon 2. 3 Crack propagation along interfaces 2. 4 Numerical methods for the study of crack propagation 2. 4. 1 Activation criterion 2. 4. 2 Propagation direction 2. 4. 3 Geometry update 2. 5 Conclusion 3 Crack initiation in SLiM-Cut samples 3. 1 Introduction 3. 2 Finite element model for the analysis of the crack initiation 3. 3 Analysis of alternative materials 3. 3. 1 Effect of the Young’s modulus and the CTE 3. 3. 2 Effect of the thickness 3. 3. 3 Effect of the Poisson ratio 3. 4 Analysis of the notch 3. 5 Polymer-based SLiM-cut: a case study 3. 5. 1 Experimental method 3. 5. 2 Results and discussion 3. 6 Conclusion 4 Analysis of crack propagation in Slim-cut samples 4. 1 Introduction 4. 2 Analytical solution for quasi-static crack propagation in isotropic materials 4. 3 Quasi-static crack propagation in epoxy-induced spalling of silicon 4. 4 Crack surface morphology 4. 4. 1 Results 4. 4. 2 Discussion 4. 5 Guidelines for the improvement of the technique 4. 6 Conclusion 5 PS formation and characterization 5. 1 Introduction 5. 2 PS formation 5. 3 Microstructure of PS layers 5. 4 Characterization of the porosity 5. 4. 1 Gravimetric measurements 5. 4. 2 Reflectivity measurements 5. 4. 3 Spectroscopic ellipsometry 5. 4. 4 Evaluation of the porosity: a comparison between methods 5. 5 HF depletion effect during electrochemical etching 5. 6 Conclusion 6 Sintering of PS layer and optimization of the seed layer 6. 1 Sintering of PS: an overview on the theory 6. 2 Reorganization sequence 6. 2. 1 Experimental method 6. 2. 2 Results 6. 2. 3 Discussion 6. 3 Stability of thin PS layers upon annealing 6. 4 Effect of the HF depletion in sintered PS layers 6. 5 Optimization of the PS seed layer 6. 5. 1 Experimental method 6. 5. 2 Results 6. 5. 3 Discussion 6. 6 Conclusion 7 PS mechanical properties 7. 1 Mechanical simulations of epitaxial foils 7. 1. 1 Multi-scale approach 7. 1. 2 Homogenization theory 7. 2 Elastic properties of sintered PS 7. 2. 1 Low porosity layer 7. 2. 2 High porosity layer 7. 2. 3 Double layers 7. 3 Post-elastic properties of PS stacks 7. 3. 1 Strength of PS double layers 7. 3. 2 Detachment mode 7. 4 Conclusion 8 <b>Foil</b> minority <b>carrier</b> lifetime and solar cell processing 8. 1 Introduction 8. 2 Processing of SLiM-cut foils into solar cells 8. 3 Quality of SLiM-cut foils 8. 4 Processing of epitaxial foils into solar cells 8. 4. 1 Rear side conditioning 8. 5 Quality of epitaxial foils 8. 6 Comparison between SLiM-cut and epitaxial foils 8. 7 Conclusion 9 Conclusion & Outlook A Appendix A. 1 Dam & Fill technique A. 2 Dynamic mechanical analysis A. 3 Lasering setup for the notch preparation in SLiM-cut A. 4 Impulsive stimulated thermal scattering A. 5 Electron spin resonance Bibliography Publicationsnrpages: 244 status: publishe...|$|R
