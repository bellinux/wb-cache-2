Some compounds appear fanciful, or at least not immediately transparent, such as ky + luf (eat + air) to mean [...] "picnic". Grammatical features include the use of single letters (as opposed to verb conjugations) to indicate tense; the letter r indicates future tense and y indicates past. Thus, j sa = I know, j ysa = I knew, j r sa = I will know. Nouns and verbs have the same form (as do many English words: the light, I light, etc.) as do adverbs and adjectives (bel = [...] "beautiful" [...] and [...] "beautifully").

We consider the numerous advantages of using the World Wide Web, and use of information to improve teaching and practice of certain types of speech activity. Examples of the application of online resources to practice writing, speaking, listening and reading are given. As an example, certain websites are mentioned, where teachers of foreign languages may find some useful information to enhance and improve the teaching of foreign language. There are various aspects of Internet resources for practice of improvement lexical and grammatical material for different levels of foreign language. Attention is focused on good practice and opportunity of live communication with native speakers is excellent, the use of accumulated material and the ability to <b>expand</b> <b>vocabulary</b> and knowledge. For students it is important to hear not only the teacher but also a true native speaker. In addition, the English language itself, is very versatile and varied. So, the British pronunciation markedly differs from American or Australian pronunciation. Thus, the student can hear the different tones and features of pronunciation by communicating with native foreign language speakers from different countries. ?????? ????????? ????????? ????????????? ???????? ???????? ? ???????? ???????????? ???????????? ?????. ??????????????? ???????????? ???????????? ????????????? ????????? ????, ? ????????????? ?????????? ??? ???????? ???????????? ? ?????????????????? ???????? ????? ??????? ????????????. ???????? ??????? ????????????? ???????? ???????? ??? ???????? ??????, ?????????, ??????????? ? ??????. ??????????????? ????????? ??????? ????????????? ???????? ???????? ??? ???????? ????????? ???????????? ? ??????????????? ?????????? ??? ?????? ??????? ???????? ??????????? ??????. ????????????? ???????? ?? ?????? ? ??????????? ???????? ?????? ??????? ? ?????????? ?????, ??? ???????? ???????? ????????????? ????????????? ?????????, ? ????? ??????????? ?????????? ???????????? ?????? ? ??????. ??? ????????? ????? ????? ??????? ???????????? ?? ?????? ?????????????, ? ? ????????? ???????? ?????. ????? ???????, ??????? ????? ???????? ?????? ??????? ? ??????????? ????????????, ??????? ? ?????????? ????? ?? ?????? ?????...|$|E

40|$|Background Five {{to seven}} percent of young {{children}} have SLI, often including problems with word learning. SLTs currently use real objects (ROs) to re-enact daily situations and teach new words to children. With the introduction of tablets, many games have been developed and more young children use tablets. Children like playing tablet games (TGs), and playing together with an SLT might be useful in vocabulary interventions. However, studies {{on the effectiveness of}} TGs in vocabulary treatment are lacking, and no comparison has been made between TG and ROs interventions. Aims To determine if young children with SLI passively could learn the same number of words in vocabulary treatment with TGs as they could in treatment with ROs. To investigate the preference of children for TG or ROs in treatment. Method 21 children (3; 4 to 4; 7 years) with SLI participated in this randomized-controlled crossover study. Together with an SLT, children played a TG twice and played with ROs twice about ‘supermarket’ and ‘restaurant’. Group A started with the TG and group B with ROs. During interventions, the SLT used a script including eight target words which she offered to the children. Passive word learning was measured by means of a picture pointing task through pre-tests, post-tests and retention tests. Preference of participants for the material was obtained by asking the children. Results Effect of time on passive word learning was significant in TG, RO and TG_Control condition. There was interaction between time and condition between TG and TG_Control condition and between RO and RO_Control condition. Eighty-one percent of the children preferred the TG. Conclusion Children learned the same number of words in vocabulary treatment with TGs as they do in treatment with ROs. They learned significant more target than control words.

40|$|This autoethnographic study {{reports on}} the author’s {{experiences}} learning Huitepec Mixtec, or Tnu’un Davi, an Indigenous language {{from the state of}} Oaxaca, Mexico. The author engaged in a six-week intensive language study. Then, she continued learning independently and engaged in bi-weekly oral interactive pairwork with a fellow learner. Data from notes taken during class, a journal, recorded oral tasks and self-created materials is combined to reflect on the language learning experiences from a learner’s point of view. Furthermore, this data is analyzed {{from the perspective of a}} second language acquisition researcher. Diary studies reporting learner experiences learning a language are not new (see Bailey, 1991), however little has been published on learner’s experiences learning minority languages or endangered languages. As an avid language learner, language teacher and researcher, and a non-native and non-heritage language learner, my experience cannot and should not be generalized, yet it provides light into language learning phenomena and other variables at play especially for learners of Indigenous languages living in urban contexts or far away from a speech community. Some of the challenges the author faced were: a) limited access to speakers and few opportunities to communicate or practice conversation and pronunciation; b) learning an oral language primarily through text; c) the existence of multiple mutually unintelligible variants; d) an ongoing process of orthographic standardization; e) no standardized measures to assess proficiency; f) few existing learning resources, and finally; g) learning the language in a very different cultural context and in an urban environment, making it difficult to find practical uses for traditional domains and <b>expand</b> <b>vocabulary</b> to new domains. These challenges, in turn, point to opportunities for language learners and language revitalization movements. These include a) using technology to connect and seek out opportunities for oral interaction, expanding learning strategies to include oral practice; b) prioritizing self-assessment of language learning, emphasizing individual goals and needs; c) making, developing and sharing new resources; d) viewing learning and language as a process, adopting a descriptive, sociolinguistic perspective on language variation and change, and finally; e) exploring and learning about the cosmology embedded in the language, reflecting about ways to transfer and adapt traditional knowledges and apply them in an urban context, while also exploring and negotiating ways to expand the language into new domains. The presentation will describe how the author identified and approached these opportunities through narratives, digital multimedia, language learning materials and video recordings.

40|$|The {{power loom}} {{has long been}} a time and labor saving device {{resulting}} in a separation of the weaver/designer from the process of making cloth. This is evident in the Taiten shibori fabrics of the early 20 th century, the only form of Japanese loom woven shibori. Taiten fabric was woven of plain weave with heavier threads placed at intervals in the warp. When the cloth is removed from the loom the heavy threads are pulled to form a resist for dyeing. While developing my own process of woven shibori I was not able to understand why the Japanese never developed a similarly <b>expanded</b> <b>vocabulary</b> of woven pattern resist, although they had refined shibori to include extensive patterns of stitched, wrapped and tied resists. Once I realized that the taiten fabrics were made on industrial looms and then taken to dyers to be hand processed, {{it became clear that the}} weaver was not the dyer. In the case of my own woven shibori, the weaver is the dyer, allowing me to make connections between weaving, resist and dyeing. As we enter the 21 st century when Jacquard and industrial equipment is becoming accessible to the textile artist, the relationship between industrial production and hand process deserves examination. My opportunity to work in a small textile mill is resulting in a vastly <b>expanded</b> <b>vocabulary</b> of woven resist patterns for shibori. Access to jacquard looms, combined with the ability to connect designing, weaving and dyeing, is transforming the way I work and the resulting fabrics. 20 -minute presentation including images of historical taiten process and the artist’s fabrics and process...|$|R
