A good estimator not only produces an appropriate estimate but also ensures that the estimate is insensitive to other factors such as noise or uncertainty.

It is well known that the passivity properties of the dynamics allows design of velocity-free controllers using a first-order stable filter driven by measured states. When external <b>disturbance</b> <b>torques</b> are taken into account, however, the robustness properties of these passivity-based output feedback controllers cannot be readily analyzed because the Lyapunov-like function from which the controller is derived has a time-derivative that is only negative semidefinite, and therefore non-strict.

40|$|Direct current motors are an {{integral}} part of many systems. An important factor in the design of these systems is the <b>disturbance</b> <b>torque</b> on the motor 2 ̆ 7 s shaft.

40|$|Abstract Background Humans {{are capable}} of fast {{adaptation}} to new unknown dynamics that affect their movements. Such motor learning is also believed {{to be an important}} part of motor rehabilitation. Bimanual training can improve post-stroke rehabilitation outcome and is associated with interlimb coordination between both limbs. Some studies indicate partial transfer of skills among limbs of healthy individuals. Another aspect of bimanual training is the (a) symmetry of bimanual movements and how these affect motor learning and possibly post-stroke rehabilitation. Methods A novel bimanual 2 -DOF robotic system was used for both bimanual and unimanual reaching movements. 35 young healthy adults participated in the study. They were divided into 5 test groups that performed movements under different conditions (bimanual or unimanual movements and symmetric or asymmetric bimanual arm loads). The subjects performed a simple tracking exercise with the bimanual system. The exercise was developed to stimulate motor learning by applying a velocity-dependent <b>disturbance</b> <b>torque</b> to the handlebar. Each subject performed 255 trials divided into three phases: baseline without <b>disturbance</b> <b>torque,</b> training phase with <b>disturbance</b> <b>torque</b> and evaluation phase with <b>disturbance</b> <b>torque.</b> Results Performance was assessed with the maximal values of rotation errors of the handlebar. After exposure to <b>disturbance</b> <b>torque,</b> the errors decreased for both unimanual and bimanual training. Errors in unimanual evaluation following the bimanual training phase were not significantly different from errors in unimanual evaluation following unimanual training. There was no difference in performance following symmetric or asymmetric training. Changing the arm force symmetry during bimanual movements from asymmetric to symmetric had little influence on performance. Conclusions Subjects could adapt to an unknown <b>disturbance</b> <b>torque</b> that was changing the dynamics of the movements. The learning effect was present during both unimanual and bimanual training. Transfer of learned skills from bimanual training to unimanual movements was also observed, as bimanual training also improved single limb performance with the dominant arm. Changes of force symmetry did not have an effect on motor learning. As motor learning is believed to be an important mechanism of rehabilitation, our findings could be tested for future post-stroke rehabilitation systems. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{environmental disturbance}} rejection in a 2 -DOF inertial stabilization system {{by a combination}} of feedback and feedforward control. For feedback control, sliding mode control and the line of sight (LOS) stabilization are used for compensation of the nonlinearities, model uncertainties, friction and disturbances from outside environment. Although our mechanisms are carefully designed with statically balance, the center of the gravity will changed due to the configuration change during moving of the gimbal relative to an aerial vehicle. The <b>disturbance</b> <b>torque</b> from unbalance mass and gimbal geometry is unavoidable under the effect of the vibration of the aerial vehicle, which will lead to degrade the system’s accuracy. Since the acceleration of the aerial carrier, due to the <b>disturbance</b> <b>torque,</b> can be measured, a feedforward disturbance rejection can be generated to compensate the <b>disturbance</b> <b>torque.</b> The experimental results confirm the validity of the control design procedure for the two-axis gimbaled stabilization system.

40|$|A {{predictive}} temperature {{estimation technique}} {{which can be}} used to drive a model of the Sunrise/Sunset thermal 'snap' <b>disturbance</b> <b>torque</b> experienced by low Earth orbiting spacecraft is described. The twice per orbit impulsive <b>disturbance</b> <b>torque</b> is attributed to vehicle passage {{in and out of the}} Earth's shadow cone (umbra), during which large flexible appendages undergo rapidly changing thermal conditions. Flexible members, in particular solar arrays, experience rapid cooling during umbra entrance (Sunset) and rapid heating during exit (Sunrise). The thermal 'snap' phenomena has been observed during normal on-orbit operations of both the LANDSAT- 4 satellite and the Communications Technology Satellite (CTS). Thermal 'snap' has also been predicted to be a dominant source of error for the TOPEX satellite. The fundamental equations used to model the Sunrise/Sunset thermal 'snap' <b>disturbance</b> <b>torque</b> for a typical solar array like structure will be described. For this derivation the array is assumed to be a thin, cantilevered beam. The time varying thermal gradient is shown to be the driving force behind predicting the thermal 'snap' <b>disturbance</b> <b>torque</b> and therefore motivates the need for accurate estimates of temperature. The development of a technique to optimally estimate appendage surface temperature is highlighted. The objective analysis method used is structured on the Gauss-Markov Theorem and provides an optimal temperature estimate at a prescribed location given data from a distributed thermal sensor network. The optimally estimated surface temperatures could then be used to compute the thermal gradient across the body. The estimation technique is demonstrated using a typical satellite solar array...|$|E

Without resorting to discontinuous switching, this controller thus overcomes the unwinding phenomenon associated with continuous controllers based on attitude representa-tions, such as quaternions, that are not bijective. The controller requires no inertia information, no information on constant <b>disturbance</b> <b>torques,</b> and only frequency information for sinusoidal <b>disturbance</b> <b>torques.</b> For slew maneuvers, that is, ma-neuvers with a setpoint command {{in the absence of}} disturbances, the controller specializes to a continuous, nonlinear, proportional-derivative-type almost globally stabilizing controller, in which case the torque inputs can be arbitrarily bounded a priori.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an attitude control strategy {{and a new}} nonlinear tracking controller for a spacecraft carrying a large object, such as an asteroid or a boulder. If the captured object is larger or comparable in size to the spacecraft and has significant modeling uncertainties, conventional nonlinear control laws that use exact feedforward cancellation are not suitable because they exhibit a large resultant <b>disturbance</b> <b>torque.</b> The proposed nonlinear tracking control law guarantees global exponential convergence of tracking errors with finite-gain L_p stability {{in the presence of}} modeling uncertainties and disturbances, and it reduces the resultant <b>disturbance</b> <b>torque.</b> Furthermore, this control law permits the use of any attitude representation, and its integral control formulation eliminates any constant disturbance. Under small uncertainties, the best strategy for stabilizing the combined system is to track a fuel-optimal reference trajectory using this nonlinear control law because it consumes the least amount of fuel. In the presence of large uncertainties, the most effective strategy is to track the derivative plus proportional–derivative-based reference trajectory because it reduces the resultant <b>disturbance</b> <b>torque.</b> The effectiveness of the proposed attitude control methods is demonstrated by using results of numerical simulation based on an Asteroid Redirect Mission concept...|$|E
