5|$|Takumi {{felt that}} the best way to write a mystery with a good climax is to reveal various clues, and then pull them {{together}} into one conclusion, and not have multiple possible endings. He said that the biggest challenge with that was to make the gameplay and story work together; the goal was to make the player feel like they have driven the story forward themselves, with their own choices, even though the game is linear. When writing the episodes, Takumi ranked each after its importance: the first episode was the most <b>important,</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure that the player likes the game; the second episode was the second most important, to solidify the player's interest; and the finale was the third most important. In general, each scenario was finished before anything else was done; after this, characters were designed based on the scenarios, and then Takumi adjusted dialogue as needed to make sure that it fit the designs. At this point, it was also decided what scenes were going to have specific cut-in illustrations made for them; Takumi drew rough sketches of them, and also drew the storyboards for the episodes' openings, which consist of series of detailed drawings that show what is happening.|$|E

This is essential, especially given the high turnover of senior staff in municipal utilities {{as a result of}} frequent changes in municipal governments. It is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> municipal service providers more autonomous, to insulate them as much as possible from political influence, and to provide training and a career path for utility employees.|$|E

25|$|Antihypertensive {{drug use}} during {{pregnancy}} is relatively common and increasing. Only {{a small proportion}} of available antihypertensive drugs have been tested in pregnant women, and many are contraindicated. It is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the exposure of medications to the baby as small as possible. It is not clear if treating women who have mild or moderate hypertension during pregnancy with anti-hypertensive medication is beneficial.|$|E
25|$|At {{the present}} stage of CFE theory development, it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a {{distinction}} between theoretical CFE equations and an empirical CFE equation. The former are derived from condensed matter physics (albeit in contexts where their detailed development is difficult). An empirical CFE equation, on the other hand, simply attempts to represent the actual experimental form of the dependence of current i on voltage V.|$|E
25|$|Allergies to sulfonamide are common. According to data {{the overall}} {{incidence}} of adverse drug reactions to sulfa antibiotics is approximately 3%, close to penicillin; hence medications containing sulfonamides are prescribed carefully. It is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{a distinction between}} sulfa drugs and other sulfur-containing drugs and additives, such as sulfates and sulfites, which are chemically unrelated to the sulfonamide group, and do not cause the same hypersensitivity reactions seen in the sulfonamides.|$|E

And a lot of times, the words excite me as shapes, and something'll grow out of that. I used to cut these little letters out and glue them on. They just look good all lined up like teeth... sometimes they become the title of the painting.|$|E
25|$|Minimize free riding: Free riding {{occurs when}} members do less work {{because some of}} the {{benefits}} accrue to others. As others contribute ideas, individuals may feel less motivated to work hard themselves. They see their own contributions as less necessary or less likely to have much impact. To eliminate these effects, it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> group members feel that their contributions are essential for the groupâ€™s success. Additionally, it is less likely for someone to free-ride if they are in a small group.|$|E
25|$|Formulation studies involve {{developing}} a {{preparation of the}} drug which is both stable and acceptable to the patient. For orally administered drugs, this usually involves incorporating the drug into a tablet or a capsule. It is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the distinction that a tablet contains {{a variety of other}} potentially inert substances apart from the drug itself, and studies have to be carried out to ensure that the encapsulated drug is compatible with these other substances {{in a way that does}} not cause harm, whether direct or indirect.|$|E

25|$|Foote was {{enthusiastic}} {{about the prospect of}} using gunboats for reconnaissance, and promptly made preparations in January, 1863 to further navigate the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers. The idea of using gunboats for river reconnaissance was before this time a novel idea whose tactics were not thoroughly tested, and it was <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> careful reconnaissance trips, without arousing any suspicion of what was being planned. It was also uncertain how ironclads would fare against land-batteries at close range. Another of these expeditions was conducted on January 7, which was logged and reported by Lieutenant Phelps of the Conestoga.|$|E
500|$|Knut's {{remains were}} {{exhibited}} in Berlin's Museum of Natural History, although this decision has caused some controversy with fans. A full-sized sculpture covered in Knut's pelt {{was presented to}} the public on 16 February 2013. It went on display in the entrance hall of the museum where it was viewed free of charge until 5 May. It will later be used for an exhibition on climate change and environment protection. Museum spokeswoman Gesine Steiner stated that [...] "It's <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> clear we haven't had Knut stuffed. It is an artistically valuable sculpture with the original fur." ...|$|E
500|$|Hoppus and DeLonge {{took the}} songwriting {{for their first}} {{legitimate}} release very seriously. The two strove for perfection writing songs that they felt would be relatable. Blink also recorded joke tracks, as they felt that, {{in addition to the}} serious songs, [...] "it was almost as <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> people laugh." [...] DeLonge recalled that the band spent more time at the end of production on Buddha trying to perfect the joke songs rather than their serious tracks. The band's main influence on Buddha, according to DeLonge, was the Descendents. [...] "I was trying to emulate that band. Really punchy guitars, fast, simple and formulaic nursery rhyme love songs," [...] he said in 2012.|$|E

500|$|Since the A-10 flies low to {{the ground}} and at subsonic speed, {{aircraft}} camouflage is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the aircraft more difficult to see. Many different types of paint schemes have been tried. These have included a [...] "peanut scheme" [...] of sand, yellow and field drab; black and white colors for winter operations and a tan, green and brown mixed pattern. Many A-10s also featured a false canopy painted in dark gray {{on the underside of the}} aircraft, just behind the gun. This form of automimicry is an attempt to confuse the enemy as to aircraft attitude and maneuver direction. Many A-10s feature nose art, such as shark mouth or warthog head features.|$|E
500|$|T. R. Knight {{signed on}} for the pilot as O'Malley, expecting that the role might be short-lived, because he liked that the {{character}} was multi-faceted. In October 2006, news reports surfaced that Washington had insulted Knight with a homophobic slur, during an argument with Patrick Dempsey (Derek Shepherd). Shortly after, {{the details of the}} argument became public, and Knight later disclosed that the slur made him come out as gay. [...] "I was under no delusions," [...] Knight said at the time. [...] "My friends on the set knew. We talked about it. Publicly it's not my thing to call up People magazine and be like, 'Hey, you want to know something about me?'...I could've just let it slide and not said anything, but it became important. It became <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the statement." [...] The situation seemed somewhat resolved when Washington issued a statement, apologizing for his [...] "unfortunate use of words during the recent incident on-set".|$|E
500|$|As {{well as the}} {{tributes to}} DemoitiÃ©, many riders also called for {{improved}} safety for professional bike races. Many riders had been involved with crashes with race motorbikes in the previous few years, including Peter Sagan, Taylor Phinney, Greg Van Avermaet, SÃ©rgio Paulinho, Jakob Fuglsang, Jesse Sergent, Sylvain Chavanel and Stig Broeckx. Alberto Contador tweeted [...] "Regulations on motos in races are needed NOW", while other riders called for clear rules, speed limits and exams for race motorbike riders. Marcel Kittel described rider safety as an issue that needed the same priority as anti-doping. Wantyâ€“Groupe Gobert's press officer said that the motorbike rider was experienced and was not {{to blame for the}} accident. The president of cycling's governing body, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), said that there would be an emergency meeting of its Road Commission to discuss the incident; he also said that they needed to wait for the result of the police enquiry and that it was <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure that the [...] "right decisions" [...] were made.|$|E

500|$|Fruit was readily {{combined}} with meat, fish and eggs. The recipe for Tart de brymlent, a fish pie from the recipe collection Forme of Cury, includes {{a mix of}} figs, raisins, apples and pears with fish (salmon, codling or haddock) and pitted damson plums under the top crust. It was considered <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure that the dish agreed with contemporary standards of medicine and dietetics. This meant that food had to be [...] "tempered" [...] according to its nature by an appropriate combination of preparation and mixing certain ingredients, condiments and spices; fish was seen as being cold and moist, and best cooked {{in a way that}} heated and dried it, such as frying or oven baking, and seasoned with hot and dry spices; beef was dry and hot and should therefore be boiled; pork was hot and moist and should therefore always be roasted. In some recipe collections, alternative ingredients were assigned with more consideration to the humoral nature than what a modern cook would consider to be similarity in taste. In a recipe for quince pie, cabbage is said to work equally well, and in another turnips could be replaced by pears.|$|E
500|$|The game's fifth episode, [...] "Rise {{from the}} Ashes", was not {{included}} in the original version of the game; it was created four years later, as part of the Nintendo DS version of the game. The fifth episode was produced by Minae Matsukawa, under supervision of Inaba and Mikami. New music pieces for [...] "Rise from the Ashes" [...] were composed by Naoto Tanaka. When writing the episode, Takumi wanted it to link up with Edgeworth's disappearance in the second game, , so he thought about what would be the thing that would be the most damaging to Edgeworth's psyche. He decided on corruption and betrayal from within the prosecutor's office, despite the seriousness of the topic. The character Jake Marshall was created as a parallel to Godot, in an analogy between the Skye sisters and the Fey sisters. The idea to include the use of the Nintendo DS system's microphone came from American Capcom staff members; the Japanese staff did not like the idea of adding unnecessary features, but Takumi thought it was <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the American audience happy, so it was included as an optional feature.|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} the story was that while each case is a {{standalone}} episode, they are also all interlinked, forming a larger mystery, with each episode revealing {{a piece of the}} puzzle. Because Edgeworth is portrayed as a genius prosecutor, whereas Phoenix Wright is a rookie attorney, the development team felt that they needed to come up with incidents that were larger in scale for Ace Attorney Investigations, to match Edgeworth's skill level; therefore, the opponents were made [...] "more formidable" [...] compared to the ones in previous games in the series. Eshiro saw the story as {{the most important part of}} the game, and said that, while time consuming, it was <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure that it works. This was accomplished through a lot of trial and error, and several rewrites and revisions: Yamazaki would come up with an idea, which was tested to see if players had a hard time understanding it. Based on feedback from the testers, Yamazaki would rewrite and reorder some parts, and add hints. When creating the game's story, the development team took into account that some players might not have played any Ace Attorney games before. Because of this, they tried to make the game as accessible as possible, and make it playable without first having played any of the previous titles; for instance, the first part of the game is a tutorial that introduces the game and the characters. They did however add in-jokes for players who had played previous Ace Attorney games. Kay Faraday was the first new character that was created for the game, and was cited by Eshiro as one of his favorite characters.|$|E
