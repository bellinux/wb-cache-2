The VOC families studied in this work were alkenes, alkynes, halogenated alkanes and amines. Solubility predictions in the form of infinite dilution activity coefficients were made using the Modified UNIFAC Dortmund group contribution model, and were computed using a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet specifically designed for this purpose. It was found that, with the exception of cyclopentadiene, alkene activity coefficients decreased slightly with increasing temperature thereby generally deviating from ideality. Solubility of alkyne interactions with unsaturated esters increased with increasing temperature, but decreased with saturated ester interactions for the terminal alkynes. With the exception of trichloromethane <b>halogenated</b> <b>alkane</b> activity coefficients decreased with increasing temperature, thus deviating from ideality. Interactions of esters with amines yielded a decrease in activity coefficients with increasing temperature, hence also deviating from ideality...|$|E
40|$|A {{molecular}} understanding of volatile anesthetic mechanisms of action will require structural descriptions of anesthetic-protein complexes. Previous work {{has demonstrated that}} the <b>halogenated</b> <b>alkane</b> volatile anesthetics halothane and chloroform bind to the hydrophobic core of the four-α-helix bundle (Aα 2 -L 38 M) 2 (Johansson et al., 2000, 2003). This study shows that the halogenated ether anesthetics isoflurane, sevoflurane, and enflurane are also bound to the hydrophobic core of the four-α-helix bundle, using isothermal titration calorimetry. Isoflurane and sevoflurane both bound to the four-α-helix bundle with Kd values of 140 ± 10 μM, whereas enflurane bound with a Kd value of 240 ± 10 μM. The ΔH° values associated with isoflurane, sevoflurane, and enflurane binding were – 7. 7 ± 0. 1 kcal/mol, − 8. 2 ± 0. 2 kcal/mol, and – 7. 2 ± 0. 1 kcal/mol, respectively. The ΔS° values accompanying isoflurane, sevoflurane, and enflurane binding were − 8. 5 cal/mol K, − 10. 4 cal/mol K, and − 8. 0 cal/mol K, respectively. The {{results indicate that the}} hydrophobic core of (Aα 2 -L 38 M) 2 is able to accommodate three modern ether anesthetics with Kd values that approximate their clinical EC 50 values. The ΔH° values point to the importance of polar interactions for volatile general anesthetic binding, and suggest that hydrogen bonding to the ether oxygens may be operative...|$|E
40|$|This paper reviews recent {{investigations}} by Slater {{and colleagues}} into the metabolic activation of halogenated alkanes {{in general and}} carbon tetrachloride in particular. It is becoming increasingly accepted that free radical intermediates {{are involved in the}} toxicity of many such compounds through mechanisms including lipid peroxidation, covalent binding, and cofactor depletion. Here we describe the experimental approaches that are used to establish that halogenated alkanes are metabolized in animal tissues to reactive free radicals. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy is used to identify free-radical products, often using spin-trapping compounds. The generation of specific free radicals by radiolytic methods is useful in the determination of the precise reactivity of radical intermediates postulated to be injurious to the cell. The enzymic mechanism of the production of such free radicals and their subsequent reactions with biological molecules is studied with specific metabolic inhibitors and free-radical scavengers. These combined techniques provide considerable insight into the process of metabolic activation of halogenated compounds. It is readily apparent, for instance, that the local oxygen concentration at the site of activation is of crucial importance to the subsequent reactions; the formation of peroxy radical derivatives from the primary free-radical product is shown to be of great significance in relation to carbon tetrachloride and may be of general importance. However, while these studies have provided much information on the biochemical mechanisms of <b>halogenated</b> <b>alkane</b> toxicity, it is clear that many problems remain to be solved...|$|E

40|$|Vibrational sum {{frequency}} spectroscopy (VSFS) is a surface specific nonlinear technique that provides vibrational spectra of molecules at interfaces. Studies {{presented in this}} thesis use VSFS to examine surface structure of common liquids at liquid/vapor interfaces. The goal of this work is to correlate molecular structure and molecules functionality with the structure adopted by molecules at liquid surfaces. The {{first part of this}} work describes the instrumental design and components of the newly developed VSFS. New methods are developed to overcome experimental difficulties associated with data collection for an entire spectral region of interest. The methods for data analysis and spectral post processing are also presented. Surface vibrational studies of linear alkanes ranging in length from 9 to 17 carbon atoms investigated dependence of surface order on chain length. The linear alkane liquid surfaces evince a surprising degree of conformational order and this surface structure becomes more disordered as chain length increases. <b>Halogenated</b> <b>alkane</b> studies showed that replacing one terminal methyl group of linear alkanes with CH 2 X (X=Cl or Br) for chain lengths 10, 14 and 16 leads to a mixed surface layer primarily occupied by CH 2 X. These results are attributed to dipole-dipole interactions between the CH 2 X and are indicative of a higher surface activity of the halogenated ends compared to the unsubstituted ends. Additional experiments have investigated the effect of stronger interactions on the surface structure of 1 -, 3 -, and 5 -nonanols and their ketone analogs namely 1 -, 3 -, and 5 -nonanones. Results showed an increasing order as the OH or =O groups advances {{toward the center of the}} molecule. A surprising result is a slightly lower surface order for nonanones compared to nonanols hints at the relative importance of simple dipolar interactions and highly directional hydrogen bonding in determining the surface structure. In addition, vibrational studies are carried out for 1 - and 3 -octanol at liquid/vapor interfaces. The results confirm observations from the nonanols by having a higher order for the 3 -octanol. However, monolayer of 1 -octanol on aqueous surface have a much higher surface order compared to 3 -octanol. The increased order is attributed to the strong hydrogen bonding with water molecules...|$|E

With increasing public health concerns {{for the effects of}} Disinfection By-Products (DBPs), there are considerable benefits in developing Quantitative Structure and Activity Relationship (QSAR) models capable of accurately predicting Log P. In this research, Log P values of 173 DBP compounds in 6 functional classes were used to develop QSAR models, by applying 3 molecular descriptors, namely, Energy of the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (ELUMO), Number of Chlorine (NCl) and Number of Carbon (NC) by Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) analysis. The QSAR models developed were validated based on the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) principles. The model Applicability Domain (AD) and mechanistic interpretation were explored. Considering the very complex nature of DBPs, the established QSAR models performed very well with respect to goodness-of-fit, robustness and predictability. The predicted values of Log P of DBPs by the QSAR models were found to be significant with a correlation coefficient R 2 from 81 % to 98 %. The Leverage Approach by Williams Plot was applied to detect and remove outliers, consequently increasing R 2 by approximately 2 % to 13 % for different DBP classes. The developed QSAR models were statistically validated for their predictive power by the Leave-One-Out (LOO) and Leave-Many-Out (LMO) cross validation methods. Finally, Monte Carlo simulation was used to assess the variations and inherent uncertainties in the QSAR models of Log P and determine the most influential parameters in connection with Log P prediction. ^ The developed QSAR models in this dissertation will have a broad applicability domain because the research data set covered six out of eight common DBP classes, including <b>halogenated</b> <b>alkane,</b> halogenated alkene, halogenated aromatic, halogenated aldehyde, halogenated ketone, and halogenated carboxylic acid, which have been {{brought to the attention of}} regulatory agencies in recent years. Furthermore, the QSAR models are suitable to be used for prediction of similar DBP compounds within the same applicability domain. The selection and integration of various methodologies developed in this research may also benefit future research in similar fields. ...|$|E

30|$|The {{ability of}} Dehalogenimonas spp. to reductively dechlorinate high {{concentrations}} of <b>halogenated</b> <b>alkanes</b> {{has important implications for}} cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater. Abiotic transformation of these chemicals in the environment is generally quite slow. For example, the environmental half-life of 1, 2 -DCA from abiotic transformation in water was estimated to be 50 years ([Vogel et al., 1987]). Unlike chlorinated ethe nes (e.g., tetrachloroethene and trichloroethene), several of the polychlorinated etha nes and propa nes, 1, 2 -DCA in particular, are resistant to transformation by zero-valent iron ([Sarathy et al., 2010]; [Song and Carraway, 2005]), limiting physicochemical remediation approaches for cleanup.

Previous studies on reductive dechlorination of <b>halogenated</b> <b>alkanes</b> have generally been conducted in a relatively narrow range of low (e.g., 0.1 to 0.5 mM) contaminant concentrations ([Chen et al., 1996]; [De Wildeman et al., 2003]; [Fletcher et al., 2009]; [Grostern and Edwards, 2006, 2009]; [Lorah and Olsen, 1999]; [Maymó-Gatell et al., 1999]; [Yan et al., 2009 a]).

50|$|All general {{anaesthetics}} induce immobilization (absence {{of movement}} in response to noxious stimuli) through depression of spinal cord functions, whereas their amnesic actions are exerted within the brain. According to the Meyer-Overton correlation the anaesthetic potency of the drug is directly proportional to its lipid solubility, however, there are many compounds that do not satisfy this rule. These drugs are strikingly similar to potent general anaesthetics and are predicted to be potent anaesthetics based on their lipid solubility, but they exert only one constituent of the anaesthetic action (amnesia) and do not suppress movement (i.e. do not depress spinal cord functions) as all anaesthetics do. These drugs {{are referred to as}} nonimmobilizers. The existence of nonimmobilizers suggests that anaesthetics induce different components of anaesthetic effect (amnesia and immobility) by affecting different molecular targets and not just the one target (neuronal bilayer) as it was believed earlier.

The third step is the comparison of each individual property with the observed property of an unknown compound, resulting in the calculation of the fitness value for each generated compound. Depending on the fitness values, the candidates {{for the next generation}} are selected by a spinning wheel procedure during the fourth step. In the last step, these candidates are rear-ranged by genetic mutation and crossover to form the next generation.

The catalytic performance of the resulting catalyst samples in the hydrodechlorination (HDCl) of 1, 2 -dichloroethane at 220 ºC was investigated, to gain understanding of metal alloying phenomena governing the variation in ethene selectivity with time on stream (TOS).

PtCuCaH(b) catalyst, synthesised by reduction with CaH 2 at 450 ºC, showed a high selectivity towards ethene in comparison with that of catalysts synthesised by reduction with either NaH or hydrogen. In view of the chemisorption and TEM results, the significant high selectivity of this catalyst towards ethene was attributed {{to the fact that}} reduction by CaH 2 enhanced alloying of Pt and Cu.

The so obtained microheterogeneous catalyst can induce biomimetic redox processes on organic substrates in aqueous medium, using sunlight and oxygen as clean reagents. The primary photochemical process consists in the photoinduced reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) with the contemporaneous oxidation of the axial ligand to radical species.

30|$|The coupled triple enzyme {{reaction}} {{described here}} allows fast simple and sensitive detection of haloalkanes but {{depending on the}} nature of the sample to be analysed several potentially limiting conditions have to be carefully considered. It has been reported that certain dehalogenases are inhibited by halides (Schindler et al., [1999]). In the case when R. erythropolis DhaA is used, presence of halide salts in concentrations up to 80 [*]mM should not disturb the reaction (Schindler et al., [1999]). It should also be noted that the signal generation in our method can similarly be triggered by traces of alcohols in the sample. In this case, it may be advisable to preincubate the analyte solution with AOX and a catalase to oxidize the alcohol to the corresponding aldehyde and to remove the hydrogen peroxide generated. Subsequent inactivation of catalase, e.g. by addition of 3 -amino- 1, 2, 4 -triazole or 4 -hydroxypyrazole (Mac[Donald and Pispa 1980], Margoliash et al., [1960]), allows one to apply the standard procedure described above. Like other methods relying on the determination of halide content (Holloway et al., [1998], Kurtovic et al., [2007], [Marchesi 2003]), this assay does not allow to distinguish between individual alkyl halides if a multicomponent mixture of haloalkanes is present in a sample. Since different <b>halogenated</b> <b>alkanes</b> give rise to distinct sensitivity and reaction rates, knowledge of the haloalkane composition of a sample would be required.

Renal cortex has high activities of cytochrome P 450 and glutathione (GSH) S-transferase. In contrast, renal medulla has high activity of prostaglandin synthetase, which can catalyze co-oxidation of xenobiotics. While these pathways are found in many tissues and at higher activities than in kidney, several key enzymes of the mercapturic acid pathway are found at especially high activities in cells of the renal proximal tubule. Investigations {{over the last two}} decades demonstrated that GSH conjugation is not only a mechanism for detoxification of reactive electrophiles. Rather, metabolism of GSH S-conjugates to the corresponding cysteine S-conjugates represents a branch point: cysteine S-conjugates may be metabolized by the cysteine S-conjugate N-acetyl-transferase to mercapturic acids, which are nontoxic and are excreted, or they may be substrates for the pyridoxal phosphate-dependent cysteine conjugate beta-lyase, which catalyzes either a beta-elimination or a transamination reaction to produce unstable thiols. These thiols rearrange to form potent acylating species that can covalently bind to cellular macromolecules, thereby producing cytotoxicity, mutagenicity, and carcinogenicity. In addition to the beta-lyase, two other renal enzymes, L- 2 -amino (2 -hydroxy) acid oxidase and cysteine conjugate S-oxidase, can bioactivate chemicals to produce nephrotoxic species. Several <b>halogenated</b> <b>alkanes</b> and alkenes are bioactivated by these pathways. These findings show that mammalian kidney is highly active in bioactivation of xenobiotics.

Excellent correlations between biotransformation rates and the calculated activation energies (delta Hact) of the cytochrome P 450 -mediated hydrogen-atom abstractions were obtained for the in vitro biotransformation of six <b>halogenated</b> <b>alkanes</b> (1 -fluoro- 1, 1, 2, 2 -tetrachloroethane, 1, 1 -difluoro- 1, 2, 2 -trichloroethane, 1, 1, 1 -trifluro- 2, 2 -dichloroethane, 1, 1, 1, 2 -tetrafluoro- 2 -chloroethane, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2,-pentafluoroethane, and 2 -bromo- 2 -chloro- 1, 1, 1 -trifluoroethane) with both rat and human enzyme preparations: In(rate, rat liver microsomes) = 44. 99 - 1. 79 (delta Hact), r 2 = 0. 86; In(rate, human CYP 2 E 1) = 46. 99 - 1. 77 (delta Hact), r 2 = 0. 97 (rates are in nmol of product per min per nmol of cytochrome P 450 and energies are in kcal/mol). Correlations were also obtained for five inhalation anesthetics (enflurane, sevoflurane, desflurane, methoxyflurane, and isoflurane) for both in vivo and in vitro metabolism by humans: In[F(-) ]peak plasma = 42. 87 - 1. 57 (delta Hact), r 2 = 0. 86. To our knowledge, these are the first in vivo human metabolic rates to be quantitatively predicted. Furthermore, this is one of the first examples where computational predictions and in vivo and in vitro data have been shown to agree in any species. The model presented herein provides an archetype for the methodology that may be used in the future design of safer chemicals, particularly hydrochlorofluorocarbons and inhalation anesthetics...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{we found}} that Alcanivorax {{bacteria}} from various marine environments were capable of degrading <b>halogenated</b> <b>alkanes.</b> Genome sequencing of A. dieselolei B- 5 revealed two putative haloalkane dehalogenase (HLD) genes, which {{were supposed to be}} involved in degradation of halogenated compounds. In this report, we confirm {{for the first time that}} the Alcanivorax bacterium encodes a truly functional HLD named DadB. An activity assay with 46 halogenated substrates indicated that DadB possesses broad substrate range and has the highest overall activity among the identified HLDs. DadB prefers brominated substrates; chlorinated alkenes; and the C 2 -C 3 substrates, including the persistent pollutants of 1, 2 -dichloroethane, 1, 2 -dichloropropane and 1, 2, 3 -trichloropropane. As DadB displays no detectable activity toward long-chain haloalkanes such as 1 -chlorohexadecane and 1 -chlorooctadecane, the degradation of them in A. dieselolei B- 5 might be attributed to other enzymes. Kinetic constants were determined with 6 substrates. DadB has highest affinity and largest k cat/K m value toward 1, 3 -dibromopropane (K(m) = 0. 82 mM, k(cat) /K(m) = 16. 43 mM(- 1) · s(- 1)). DadB aggregates fast in the buffers with pH ≤ 7. 0, while keeps stable in monomer form when pH ≥ 7. 5. According to homology modeling, DadB has an open active cavity with a large access tunnel, which is supposed important for larger molecules as opposed to C 2 -C 3 substrates. Combined with the results for other HLDs, we deduce that residue I 247 plays an important role in substrate selection.

40|$|GST (glutathione transferase) T 1 - 1 {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the biotransformation of <b>halogenated</b> <b>alkanes,</b> which are used in large quantities as solvents and occur as environmental pollutants. Many reactions that are catalysed by GST T 1 - 1 qualify as detoxification processes, but some reactions with dihalogenated alkanes lead to reactive products more toxic than the substrates. Murine GST T 1 - 1 is particularly active with dichloromethane, which may explain the high carcinogenicity of dichloromethane in the mouse. Human GST T 1 - 1 activity is considerably lower with halogenated hydrocarbons and some related substrates. Human GST T 1 - 1 is polymorphic with a frequent null phenotype, suggesting that it is advantageous, under some circumstances, to lack the functional enzyme, which catalyses GSH conjugations that may cause bioactivation. The present study shows that amino acid residue 234 is a determinant of the differences in catalytic efficiency between the human and the rodent enzymes. The replacement of Trp 234 in human GST T 1 - 1 by arginine, found in the rodent enzyme, enhanced the alkyltransferase activity by an order of magnitude with a series of homologous iodoalkanes and some typical GST substrates. The specific activity of the alternative mutant Trp 234 →Lys was lower than for the parental human GST T 1 - 1 with many substrates, showing that a positive charge is not sufficient for increased activity. The enhanced activity of Trp 234 →Arg with alkylating agents was dependent on the substrate tested, whereas no increase of the peroxidase activity with cumene hydroperoxide was noted. Residue 234 therefore is also involved in the control of the substrate selectivity of GST T 1 - 1...|$|R
40|$|Rate {{coefficients}} k(T) for dissociative {{electron attachment}} (DEA) to molecules {{in many cases}} exhibit {{a more or less}} strong rise with increasing temperature T (the electron temperature T e and the molecular temperature T G are assumed to be in thermal equilibrium, i. e., T = T e = T G). This rise is frequently modeled by the Arrhenius equation k(T) = k A exp[− Ea/(kBT) ], and an activation energy E a is deduced from fits to the experimental data k(T). This behavior reflects the presence of an energy barrier for the anion on its path to the dissociated products. In a recent paper [J. Kopyra, J. Wnorowska, M. Foryś, and I. Szamrej, Int. J. Mass Spectrom. 268, 60 (2007) ] it was suggested that the size of the rate coefficients for DEA reactions at room temperature exhibits an exponential dependence on the activation energy, i. e., k (E a; T ≈ 300 K) = k 1 exp[−E a /E 0]. More recent experimental data for molecules with high barriers [T. M. Miller, J. F. Friedman, L. C. Schaffer, and A. A. Viggiano, J. Chem. Phys. 131, 084302 (2009) ] are compatible with such a correlation. We investigate the validity and the possible origin of this dependence by analyzing the results of R-matrix calculations for temperature-dependent rate coefficients of exothermic DEA processes with intermediate barrier toward dissociation. These include results for model systems with systematically varied barrier height as well as results of molecule-specific calculations for CH 3 Cl, CH 3 Br, CF 3 Cl, and CH 2 Cl 2 (activation energies above 0. 2 eV) involving appropriate molecular parameters. A comparison of the experimental and theoretical results for the considered class of molecules (<b>halogenated</b> <b>alkanes)</b> supports the idea that the exponential dependence of k (T = 300 K) on the activation energy reflects a general phenomenon associated with Franck–Condon factors for getting from the initial neutral vibrational levels to the dissociating final anion state in a direct DEA process. Cases are discussed for which the proposed relation does not apply. ...|$|R
40|$|Conversion of {{halogenated}} aliphatics by haloalkane dehalogenase proceeds via {{the formation}} of a covalent alkyl-enzyme intermediate which is subsequently hydrolyzed by water. In the wild type enzyme, the slowest step for both 1, 2 -dichloroethane and 1, 2 -dibromoethane conversion is a unimolecular enzyme isomerization preceding rapid halide dissociation. Phenylalanine 172 is located in a helix-loop-helix structure that covers the active site cavity of the enzyme, interacts with the Cl-beta of 1, 2 -dichloroethane during catalysis, and could be involved in stabilization of this helix-loop-helix region of the cap domain of the enzyme. To obtain more information about the role of this residue in dehalogenase function, we performed a mutational analysis of position 172 and studied the kinetics and X-ray structure of the Phe 172 Trp enzyme. The Phe 172 Trp mutant had a 10 -fold higher k(cat) /K-m for 1 -chlorohexane and a 2 -fold higher k(cat) for 1, 2 -dibromoethane than the wild type enzyme, The X-ray structure of the Phe 172 Trp enzyme showed a local conformational change in the helix-loop-helix region that covers the active site, This could explain the elevated activity for 1 -chlorohexane of the Phe 172 Trp enzyme, since it allows this large substrate to bind more easily in the active site cavity, Pre-steady-state kinetic analysis showed that the increase in k(cat) found for 1, 2 -dibromoethane conversion could be attributed to an increase in the rate of an enzyme isomerization step that preceeds halide release. The observed conformational difference between the helix-loop-helix structures of the wild-type enzyme and the faster mutant suggests that the isomerization required for halide release could be a conformational chan of the cap domain of the dehalogenase. It is proposed that Phe 172 is involved in stabilization of the helix-loop-helix structure that covers the active site of the enzyme and creates a rigid hydrophobic cavity for small apolar <b>halogenated</b> <b>alkanes...</b>|$|R

Liver injury was induced by s. c. injection of a single dose of CCl 4 (1 ml/kg). L-carnitine (50 mg/kg/day) was given i. p. for four successive days 24 hours before CCl 4 injection, and CoQ 10 (200 mg/kg) was given as a single i. p. dose 24 hours before CCl 4 injection. Animals were sacrificed 24 hours after CCl 4 injection, blood samples were withdrawn and liver tissue samples were homogenized. The levels of the following parameters were determined: hepatic reduced glutathione, serum ALT and AST, hepatic lipid peroxides, hepatic vitamin C, hepatic and serum total protein, serum albumin, serum sialic acid, serum nitrite, and serum and hepatic total LDH activities and LDH isoenzymes. The obtained data revealed that CCl 4 injection produced a significant decrease in reduced glutathione content, vitamin C, total protein and albumin levels. However, there was a significant increase in serum ALT and AST activities, lipid peroxides, sialic acid, nitric oxide, serum and hepatic total LDH activities. On the other hand, groups treated with L-carnitine or/and CoQ 10 prior to CCl 4 injection showed an improvement in most parameters when compared with cirrhotic control group.
