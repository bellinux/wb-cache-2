50|$|An {{institution}} as {{to which}} our knowledge is mainly derived from inscriptions is the <b>ephebic</b> system at Athens. There are not only records of lists of ephebi and of their guardians and instructors, but also decrees in honour of their services, especially in taking their due part in religious and other ceremonies, and resolutions of the ephebi themselves in honour of their officials. It is possible to trace in the inscriptions, which range over several centuries, how what was originally a system of physical and military training for Athenian youths from age of 18 to 20, with outpost and police duties, was gradually transformed. In later times there {{were added to the}} instructors in military exercises others who gave lectures on what we should now call arts and science subjects; so that in the Hellenistic and Roman times, when youths {{from all parts of the}} civilised world flocked to Athens as an intellectual centre, the <b>ephebic</b> system became a kind of cosmopolitan university.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Ephebic</b> Oath was an oath sworn {{by young}} men of Classical Athens, {{typically}} eighteen-year-old sons of Athenian citizens, upon induction into the military academy, the <b>Ephebic</b> College, graduation from which was required to attain status as citizens. The applicant would have been dressed in full armour, shield and spear in his left hand, his right hand raised and touching the right hand of the moderator. [...] The oath was quoted by the Attic orator Lycurgus, in his work Against Leocrates (4th century BCE), though it is certainly archaic (5th century BCE). The Ephebate, an organization for training the {{young men of}} Athens, chiefly in military matters, had existed since the 5th century but was reorganized by Lycurgus. The oath was taken in the temple of Aglaurus, daughter of Cecrops, probably {{at the age of}} eighteen when the youth underwent an examination (Greek: δοκιμασία) and had his name entered on the deme register. He was then an ephebus until the age of twenty.|$|E

The students were supervised by officials called bideioi ("overseers") and a patronomos ("guardian of law"). During the Flavian dynasty a team-based structure was introduced to the Roman agoge which put groups of students under the command of a team leader or boagos (βοαγός).

50|$|The {{youngest}} specimens seen by Pilsbry {{had three}} whorls and {{a diameter of}} 3 mm. They had the depressed contour of adults and were strongly carinate peripherally, but the carina is distinctly weaker {{in front of the}} mouth, apparently indicating that it begins when the shell has nearly two whorls and a diameter of about a millimeter. At the 3 mm stage, the columella is very broad, semicircular, with a deep excavation and rod-like inner border (see image on the right). Very late in the neanic stage the basal keel appears, the shell then being about 5 mm in diameter; the columellar area is very narrow, at first linear. The rib or convexity of the upper surface is also of late appearance, these structures belong to the third neanic substage, the second, or unicarinate, substage thus occupying the greater part of the neanic stage. The discontinuation of the upper ridge or hump initiates the <b>ephebic</b> substage. The marginal varix and the absence of any tendency of the last whorl to descend or loosen its coil anteriorly, show that this species is at its acme. It has none of the stigmata of senility which are so manifest in Potamolithus microthauma, Potamolithus hidalgoi, etc.|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} corpus is {{a collection}} of inscriptions from Athens, dated between 31 B. C. and 267 A. D. The texts were inscribed to commemorate activities of youths and their instructors in the Athenian Ephebia The Introduction outlines the editorial conventions observed, the method of presentation, which is somewhat unusual, and the difficulties encountered in completing such a massive task. The remainder of the work comprises the corpus of inscriptions. Each inscription is preceded by an introduction which should contain the descriptions, dimensions and editorial history of each fragment. For lost inscriptions or those outside Greece, some or all of these details may be missing (see p. 3). The introduction is followed by the Greek text. A graphic follows, which usually depicts readings that I made from the stone: sometimes they are from a squeeze, once or twice from a photograph, and sometimes from an earlier copy of a lost inscription. Below the graphic are the notes which discuss where applicable the more significant new readings and any problems in the text. The entry concludes with a note on the date. The various types of <b>ephebic</b> inscriptions are grouped together; and within the groups are arranged in chronological order. The agonistic inscriptions, which commemorate the athletic activities of the ephebes, are presented in the first chapter. The second contains the small number of dedications and commemorative inscriptions preserved. In the third chapter are the numerous honorary inscriptions. These are personal monuments, set up in honour of a small number of the ephebes or their teachers and often honouring a single individual. The chapters which follow contain the <b>ephebic</b> catalogues. These do not differ essentially in purpose from the honorary inscriptions: thcy were inscribed to honour ephebes and their teachers. Yet they may list any number from a dozen to several hundred ephebes at one time. In the larger catalogues, the honours are rather thinly spread, but the names of the more important <b>ephebic</b> office holders and teachers may be inscribed prominently. Sometimes the figures of the most notable individuals may be carved in relief on the stele. The corpus is essentially source material collected for the use of other epigraphers and historians. It is hoped it will prove useful in studying the prosopography and history of Athens during this much-neglected period of its history...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the Athenian ephebeia, from its creation to 200 B. C. The primary {{aim of the}} study is to examine the forces which led to the perception of a need for the ephebeia and which influenced its creation. After describing the institution and then investigating the available evidence for its foundation date, I argue that the "formal ephebeia" was created in 335 B. C. and was substantially different in form from anything which had preceded it. There were, however, some antecedent aspects of the ephebeia which can be traced to earlier times. The following two chapters examine forces in the fifth and early fourth century which contributed {{to the creation of the}} ephebeia. The first is an examination of Greek military innovation in the fourth century and of new Athenian defensive policy. The second investigates a "discourse" of educational thought which was present in the intellectual circles of Athens in the fourth century, the nature of which can be found in writings of the "Socratic" philosophers. In the fifth chapter I descrive the environment of "Lycurgan Athens" and argue that the ephebeia was a deliberately "invented tradition" which suited its ideological context. The final chapter examines all available evidence for the history of the organization from 322 to 200 B. C., charting a transformation of the institution. There are two appendices: one on the demography of late fourth century Athens and its relationship to the ephebeia, the other on the life-dates of Menander and the year of his ephebate. There are also two catalogues of inscriptions. The first provides all fourth century <b>ephebic</b> inscriptions since the publication of Reinmuth's collection (or changes to those). The second provides all published third century <b>ephebic</b> inscriptions and some from the early second century. </p...|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} <b>ephebic</b> reliefs {{displayed}} in Athens {{during the late}} first to third centuries AD feature references to a naumachia in either words or images. This paper explores the history to these reliefs {{by looking at the}} roles played by Athenian ephebes in naval displays during the late Hellenistic period, and at the changes which occurred in both terminology and display under the Roman Empire. In both the late Hellenistic and the Roman period there is a clear association made between naval activities and the memory of the battle of Salamis in 480 BC. The rituals performed by the Athenian ephebes during festivals and at sites associated with this famous sea-battle ensured its continued memory throughout this period. Yet we also find an increased emphasis on the martial nature of the ephebes’ activities, through use of the term naumachia, during the Roman period, which made the link to Salamis increasingly specific, perhaps in relation to the sponsorship and interests of Roman emperors...|$|E
40|$|Litigants in 4 th-century Athens used opponents’ {{physical}} appearance (in court and reported on previous occasions) to ‘prove’ their inferior moral character to jurors. This dissertation examines {{the implications of}} this strategy for Athenian democratic ideology and popular morality. Demosthenes’ and Aeschines’ uses of the physiognomic strategy contain the assumption that any Athenian can accurately evaluate the character of a litigant or politician from his appearance in court or in the public space of the Agora. This assumption ideologically validates democratic decision-making in Athens’ mass juries and Assembly. The first of two case studies describes the markers which Aeschines uses to demonstrate his rival Demosthenes’ kinaidia (sexual and gender deviance). In their court battles, Aeschines varies the visual indicators of kinaidia to draw on different aspects of the stereotype. In Against Timarchos, Aeschines uses supporting speaker Demosthenes’ luxurious clothing to evoke the unchecked consumption and indulgence in (shameful) pleasures which are characteristic of the kinaidos. This portrait is thematically consistent with that of Timarchos and his other supporters, who all catastrophically lack self-control. In On the Embassy, Aeschines employs Demosthenes’ body to indicate his failed masculinity. Demosthenes challenged Aeschines’ preeminent role in civic affairs because of his lesser wealth and birth. Aeschines responds by locating military and civic worth in the body, and excluding Demosthenes from both. The second case study describes the meanings and uses of <b>ephebic</b> beauty in the trial of Timarchos. Prosecution and defense competed to portray themselves as champions of youthful beauty and proper pederastic eros. However, both exploited the suspicion of ‘gold-digging’ which <b>ephebic</b> beauty raised. The speech is intended to win over a popular audience of jurors, but decorous pederasty is usually identified as a component of aristocratic discourse. However, this and other speeches in which litigants portray themselves as good pederasts and their opponents as bad lovers or beloveds suggest that the common Athenian judged a man’s morality by his good conduct in pederastic relationships. Both case studies explore the visible indicators of normative and queer masculinities on the body, and will be of interest to scholars of the history of homosexuality...|$|E
40|$|The cult of Cabiri and Great Gods {{has in his}} diachronic {{development}} a {{great number}} of regional differences and syncretisms with local cults, but some elements seems to confirm a substantial original uniformity.

The principal feature of this iconographic elements is on the one hand the relationship with the homosexual and <b>ephebic</b> sphere, and on the other hand with the Hieros Gamos ritual. This paper concern the symbology of these animals as votive gifts in the Cult of Cabiri. We find roosters on reliefs of heroon of Diodoros Pasparos in Pergamon too: this cultic place show features and structures, which seems to be connected with the cult of Cabiri and Great Gods. The aim of this paper is to clarify the role of rooster in this cult and to understand the reasons behind the choose of this symbology by the analysis of literary and iconographic sources...|$|E
40|$|Well {{known in}} Egypt ever since prehistoric times, the most regal of all animals, the lion, holds a strong {{position}} in the imaginary of Egyptian religion. The importance of the lion cult {{is evidenced by the}} number of leonine figures in the Egyptian geography and cosmogony, and more particularly so by those found in the Delta, in the "city of lions" that stood at Tell-el-Muqdâm. This small but eloquent corpus of nine greek inscriptions, set in Leontopolis, along with various accounts by authors of that time, enable us to appreciate fully the originality of this lion cult which lasted from the foundation of the major temple under Ptolemaeus Epiphanes till the reign of Elagabal, when an <b>ephebic</b> competition was installed in honour of the lion. Through these we can also get an idea of the organisation of sacred matters, the feline menagerie, as well as the politics of a few lagid kings and of the emperor concerning the religious, administrative and military centre that made up the metropolis of the nome named Leonpolite.

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} contextualize Lycurgus ’ {{use of the}} {{historical}} example of King Codrus’ self-sacrifice within Athenian social memory and public discourse. In doing so, it offers {{a solution to the}} puzzle of Lycurgus ’ calling Codrus one of the πνυμοι τ ς χρας (Lycurg. 88). I make the case that Codrus was one of the forty-two eponymous age-set heroes (Ath. Pol. 53. 4 – 7) who {{played an important role in}} the Athenian military and socio-political system. I contend that devotion to the city’s gods and heroes and knowledge of their mythology were essential parts of the religious and ideological instruction of Athenian ephebes. Consequently, Lycurgus ’ citation of the <b>Ephebic</b> Oath, the self-sacrifices of King Codrus and the daughters of Erechtheus, as well as his repeated invocation of the city’s gods and shrines, must be seen as integral elements of his indictment of Leocrates for cowardice and treason, behavior that is diametrically opposed to the hoplite ethos and religious devotion that were instilled into young ephebes. Lycurgus thus brings the jurors ’ memories of their own ephebate into the courtroom and taps into emotions and values that lie at the heart of Athenian collective identity. συλλαβντες δ οupsilonasperperispomeneτοι τοupsilongraveς φβους, πρτον μν τ ερ περ...|$|E
40|$|The {{theme of}} my {{graduation}} theses is ?The contribution {{to study and}} prevention of <b>ephebic</b> suicides?. More and more attention has been payed to problems of suicide behavior nowadays. But the prevention of suicide behavior has not been properly described yet {{and open to the}} public especially to teachers and pedagogical workers. It is necessary to focuse on a group of teenagers because there are more suicide attempts among these young people recently. Psychologists and doctors as well as teachers and pedagogical workers should pay more attention to these problems. Good knowledge of these problems and a readiness to help could often prevent suicide attempts. In the first / theoretical part I will describe problems of suicide behavior with a view to a group of teenagers. Basic terms will be explained, I will describe kinds of suicides, the influence of age, gender, seasons and week days on comitting suicides. I will define a suicide with a view to medical, psychological and sociological aspects. At the end of this part I will write about myths and facts concerning suicides and about the prevention of suicide behavior. In the second / practical part I will use a comparative method to confront case studies of teenagers who tried to commit suicide. I will search for especially pedagogical aspects and marks leading to the determination of abnormal behaviour to be able to prevent teenagers from comitting suicides...|$|E
40|$|Is there a {{connection}} between {{the success or failure of}} a text and the success or failure of its central protagonist? To answer this question, I shall explore the issue of ‘heroism’ in Apollonius’ Argonautica, a constant bugbear of modern scholarship, especially in its attempts to determine Jason’s suitability and success as a leader of the Argonautic crew. While he was once commonly lambasted as a weak figure (e. g. Wright 1932, Bowra 1933), recent scholarship has found many ways to rehabilitate Jason as a worthy hero of Apollonius’ epic: his journey imitates that of an <b>ephebic</b> rite of passage (Hunter 1988), his qualities reflect the ideal attributes of fourth-century kingship (Sandridge 2005), and his characteristics embody the qualities of Apollonius’ new modern epic, in contrast to Heracles, who reflects the outmoded nature of Homeric and cyclic epic (Heerink 2010). Jason has, in short, been transformed from a failure into a success. 	In this paper, I propose to explore these shifting perceptions of Jason and set the increasingly optimistic assessment of his character in the context of the re-evaluation of the Argonautica as a piece of literature. Once the Argonautica was no longer regarded as “a magnificent failure” (Wright 1932), but recognised as a sophisticated epic, its protagonist could no longer be dismissed as a failure either: he too had to be redeemed. The assessment of text and protagonist thus seem inextricably intertwined. After tracing these developments, I shall conclude by exploring their consequences for our approaches to ancient literature: does the assessment of a character really have to follow that of its text, and for a text to be successful, does it really need a successful protagonist? Ultimately, is failure a problem that has to be explained away at any cost to justify a text’s or a character’s worth...|$|E
40|$|The {{principal}} sanctuaries of Attica {{outside the}} asty were situated in strategically important {{positions at the}} territorial limits of Athens. It will {{be argued that the}} sanctuaries placed on the frontiers of Attica were important nodes in the social construction, expression and implementation of Athenian territoriality. Sanctuaries which accommodated polis-level cults outside the urban centre provided the Athenians with a highly visible means of demarcating and communicating the extent of their territorial sovereignty. These religious sites developed in a visually conspicuous manner {{at a time when the}} territorial and social boundaries between the Athenians and neighbouring communities were crystallising. From an early stage in the development of the sanctuary sites of Attica, they played an instrumental role in defining the extent of Athenian territory, a space imbued with meaning in terms of claims of sovereignty and membership within the Athenian community. During the Archaic period, the border sanctuaries of Attica and the cults which they accommodated were elaborated, augmenting Athenian claims to contested borderlands and enhancing the prestige of the polis. The relative ranking and status of Athens in her interpolis relations was thereby enhanced, allowing the Athenians to reduce the threat of invasion of the chora. Following the Persian Wars, the sanctuaries continued to disseminate messages of the power and status of Athens, now hegemon of the Delian League. The structures and rites of the border sanctuaries reified the hegemonic power of Athens. When, during the long and bitter conflict of the Peloponnesian War, it became necessary to control the points of access into Athenian territory along the coastline, Rhamnous and Sounion were fortified. In the Late Classical period, the military role of a number of these sanctuaries was institutionalised. Fortification walls were augmented and refurbished and <b>ephebic</b> involvement in rites and festivals attested the close connection between religious and military activity...|$|E
40|$|At {{the end of}} the 19 th cent. P. Orsi {{acquired}} for the Archaeological Museum of Syracuse a {{group of}} architectural terracottas said to come from Agrigentum, San Biagio area (on the SE slope of the Rupe Atenea). This lot, left quite unnoticed until now, consists of six antefixes of late 5 th-early 3 rd cent. B. C. Tarantine types with relief heads of Gorgo-Medusa, Pan, and Artemis Bendis, that can confirm the circulation of these products, known otherwhere in Sicily by a few specimens from Gela excavations and from surface finds. But the most noteworthy piece is a fragmentary clay sima with a lion head spout, dated around 280 - 70 B. C., that is particularly interesting both for the technique and for the subject of its decoration, depicting in low relief two <b>ephebic</b> Erotes hunting a she-bear in a rocky landscape. On one hand, it allows us to investigate how iconographic schemes and models could be disseminated by means of drawings or sketches, and/or casts or moulds, or some kind of “aides-mémoire”, in graphic or plastic form, and reassembled in new ways by toreuts, potters and coroplasts. As a matter of fact, some compositional devices of the cynegetic scene echo late 4 th cent. B. C. pictorial models (notwithstanding the rather rough execution of our relief); at the same time, we can observe an intended adaptation of some “aulic” or “heroic” motifs to a different content. On the other hand, the oddness of the subject, which seems unparalleled in Greek art, drives us to interpret on a metaphorical, rather than on a literal, level the meaning of the scene, through the well-known nexus of associations between hunting and eros, and between the wild she-bear and the “untamed” parthenos. If we accept such a metaphorical reading, we can argue that the architectural terracottas from San Biagio examined here are thematically linked, suggesting an “initiation” scenario and a general concern about maturation and “domestication” of young people, and shedding some light on their proper cultural and religious context...|$|E
