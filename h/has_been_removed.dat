Lizzie still remains recruitable.|$|E

5|$|Having {{ensured that}} {{sufficient}} tissue <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>removed</b> {{to allow the}} desired fusion of the skin, the circumciser pulls together the {{opposite sides of the}} labia majora, ensuring that the raw edges where the skin <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>removed</b> are well approximated. The wound is now ready to be stitched or for thorns to be applied. If a needle and thread are being used, close tight sutures will be placed to ensure that a flap of skin covers the vulva and extends from the mons veneris to the perineum, and which, after the wound heals, will form a bridge of scar tissue that will totally occlude the vaginal introitus.|$|E

5|$|Mercury is an {{ingredient}} in dental amalgams. Thiomersal (called Thimerosal in the United States) is an organic compound {{used as a}} preservative in vaccines, though this use is in decline. Thiomersal is metabolized to ethyl mercury. Although it was widely speculated that this mercury-based preservative could cause or trigger autism in children, scientific studies showed no evidence supporting any such link. Nevertheless, thiomersal <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>removed</b> from, or reduced to trace amounts in all U.S. vaccines recommended for children 6 {{years of age and}} under, with the exception of inactivated influenza vaccine.|$|E
5|$|The chronological list of Burges's major {{buildings}} {{is believed}} to be complete, although some minor works, or minimal additions to pre-existing structures, have not been included. The list of furniture and other works is selective. No listing is given of his extensive creations of jewellery, metalwork and stained glass.

Some bridges still remain, although the plate girder bridge over Goudhurst Road, Horsmonden <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>removed.</b>|$|E
5|$|Adult and {{juvenile}} finetooth sharks form large schools. This energetic, fast-moving predator feeds mainly on small bony fishes, often entering the surf zone {{during the day}} to hunt. The most important prey of this species in the northwestern Atlantic is the Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus), with sharks of all ages off northwestern Florida eat almost nothing else. The menhaden are swallowed whole after the head <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>removed.</b> Other known prey species include spot croaker (Leiostomus xanthurus), Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus maculatus), mullet (Mugil spp.), shrimp, and in one case a juvenile Atlantic sharpnose shark (Rhizoprionodon terraenovae), {{which may have been}} scavenged from the bycatch discard of a shrimp trawler. The finetooth shark may be preyed upon by larger sharks. Parasites documented from this species include the tapeworm Triloculatum geeceearelensis, and unidentified species in the genera Anthobothrium, Paraorygmatobothrium, and Phoreiobothrium.|$|E
5|$|All ports {{have been}} {{replaced}} with either two or four combination USB-C 3.1 ports that support Thunderbolt 3 and dual DisplayPort 1.2 signals, any {{of which can be}} used for charging. The MacBook Pro is incompatible with some older Thunderbolt 3 certified peripherals, including Intel's own reference design for Thunderbolt 3 devices. Furthermore, MacOS on MacBook Pro blocks certain classes of Thunderbolt 3 compatible devices from working by blacklisting them. Devices using HDMI, previous generation Thunderbolt, and USB will require an adapter to connect to the MacBook Pro. The models come with a 3.5 mm headphone jack, although TOSLINK functionality of older generation MacBook Pros <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>removed.</b>|$|E

5|$|Box {{lacrosse}}, {{also known}} as indoor lacrosse and sometimes shortened to boxla or simply box, is an indoor version of lacrosse played mostly in North America. The game originated in Canada, where {{it is the most}} popular version of the game played in contrast to the traditional field lacrosse game. It is played between two teams of five players and one goalie each, and is traditionally played on an ice hockey rink once the ice <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>removed</b> or covered. The playing area is called a box, in contrast to the open playing field of field lacrosse. The object of the game is to use a long handled racket, known as a lacrosse stick, to catch, carry, and pass the ball in an effort to score by ultimately hurling a solid rubber lacrosse ball into an opponent's goal.|$|E
5|$|Deep Impact. Debate {{continues}} {{about how}} much ice is in a comet. In 2001, the Deep Space 1 spacecraft obtained high-resolution images of the surface of Comet Borrelly. It {{was found that the}} surface of comet Borrelly is hot and dry, with a temperature of between , and extremely dark, suggesting that the ice <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>removed</b> by solar heating and maturation, or is hidden by the soot-like material that covers Borrelly. In July 2005, the Deep Impact probe blasted a crater on Comet Tempel 1 to study its interior. The mission yielded results suggesting that the majority of a comet's water ice is below the surface and that these reservoirs feed the jets of vaporised water that form the coma of Tempel 1. Renamed EPOXI, it made a flyby of Comet Hartley 2 on 4 November 2010.|$|E
5|$|Every {{character}} {{has been given}} their own unique ability. For example, Jazz can fire a grappling hook to reach high or distant places, Optimus Prime can command the massive Metroplex, and the Combaticons {{have the ability to}} combine into the Decepticon Bruticus. Segments in which players control Bruticus are designed to accommodate its larger size. Scale is maintained so the character towers over enemies. The Autobot Grimlock, who transforms into a dinosaur, is controlled differently than other characters. Carrying only a sword and shield, Grimlock cannot transform at will, instead accumulating rage as he battles opponents. When he gains enough rage, Grimlock is able to transform and inflict massive damage. The online cooperative campaign play featured in the first game <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>removed</b> in favor of levels that utilize each character's specific abilities.|$|E
