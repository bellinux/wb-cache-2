5|$|In the 20th century, feminist critics {{opened up}} new {{approaches}} to Gertrude and Ophelia. New Historicist and cultural materialist critics examined the play in its historical context, attempting to piece together its original cultural environment. They focused on the gender system of early modern England, pointing to the common trinity of maid, wife, or widow, with whores outside of that stereotype. In this analysis, the essence of Hamlet is the central character's changed perception of his mother as a whore because of her failure to remain faithful to Old Hamlet. In consequence, Hamlet loses his faith in all women, treating Ophelia as if she too were a whore and dishonest with Hamlet. Ophelia, by some critics, {{can be seen as}} honest and fair; however, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> to link these two traits, since 'fairness' is an outward trait, while 'honesty' is an inward trait.|$|E
50|$|February 7, 1887, the O’Neill {{bill was}} passed which amended the Contract Labor Law of 1885. It added three major {{sections}} {{to the original}} act.

5|$|To {{achieve that}} result, Varrick takes care {{to prevent the}} case from going to Florida, Alisandros' {{favorite}} battleground. It is much better for them to let jurisdiction be claimed by Chicago federal judge Harry Seawright, with whom Rogan Rothberg has some ties. A bonus from Varrick's {{point of view is}} the fact that the Chicago tort lawsuit was filed by such a minor and inexperienced firm as Finley & Figg; it is confidently assumed that Karros would make short work of them in court. The case is soon expedited on Seawright's docket with Finley & Figg's claim singled out of the tort claimants and Karros takes action to have Finley & Figg's eight death cases heard separately. The specific case singled out to serve as the test case is one in which Finley & Figg represents the widow of a man who died after taking Krayoxx but he was also taking prior to his death a mixture of some ten other drugs, so that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> to pinpoint the effect of Krayoxx.|$|E

25|$|The {{practice}} of exhibiting killer whales born in captivity is less controversial than of retaining free-born orcas, since the captive-born orcas have known no other world {{and may not}} be able to adapt to life in the wild. Captive breeding also promises to reduce incentives to capture wild orcas. However, in January 2002 the Miami Seaquarium stated that captive orcas are dying faster than they are being born, and as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> to obtain orcas captured from the wild, the business of exhibiting captive orcas may eventually disappear.|$|E
25|$|The case of Sanju Bhagat, {{also known}} as Sanjay Kumar, a man from Nagpur, India, {{attracted}} attention in 1999 {{for the length of}} time (36 years) he had carried his parasitic twin inside his body, {{and the size of the}} growth. Since Bhagat had no placenta, the growth had connected directly to his blood supply. In an extremely unusual case, a 2-year-old boy became pregnant with his parasitic twin inside his stomach feeding off him like a normal fetus would feed on its mother. The boy required a Caesarean section. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> that the fetus could survive this process due to being underdeveloped.|$|E
25|$|In versus-fighting games, a draw {{occurs when}} both players end the match through a double KO; or via time over, {{with the same}} {{percentage}} of life bar. For example, some of these games, such as Street Fighter and Tekken, require two winning rounds to win the match, and if after a third round the score ends in a 1–1 draw, the players have to fight again in an extra round. If this extra round ends in a draw, the game will end for both players. In Mortal Kombat, if a round ends when the time runs out and both players have complete life bars, the game ends for both players, because due to Mortal Kombats gameplay (in which every common hit takes block damage) <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> for a round to end tied, {{and that means the}} players were not playing for real. In the Super Smash Bros. series, if two players have equal lives {{at the end of a}} tied match a sudden death period begins with each player having 300% damage, essentially making it so a single hit can win the game.|$|E
