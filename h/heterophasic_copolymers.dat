40|$|In-situ {{measurements}} were done {{to get information}} about crack tip deformation processes in different polypropylenes. For the measurements a conventional fracture mechanics test arrangement for three point bending tests coupled with a stereo microscope and a camera was used. In this way a directly correlation of load and deflection with crack extension and crack tip opening displacement is possible and crack resistance curves (R-curves) can be achieved. On principle the method is a single specimen method. The influence of ethylene content and elastomer content on the crack opening displacement at the crack initiation point is demonstrated on different polypropylene (PP) materials: homopolymers, random copolymers, blends and <b>heterophasic</b> <b>copolymers...</b>|$|E
40|$|Sorption {{experiments}} of ethylene and propylene {{in different}} polypropylene powder samples, both homopolymer and <b>heterophasic</b> <b>copolymers</b> with different rubber content, {{have been carried}} out in a high-pressure magnetic suspension balance at 10 bars pressure and 70 [*]°C. The gross solubilities measured can be well correlated with the rubber content of the polymer samples. Solubility of ethylene and propylene in the rubber phase differ from solubility in the amorphous fraction of the homopolymer, especially the concentration ratio of propylene to ethylene differs significantly between rubber phase and amorphous fraction of the homopolymer. From the slope of monomer uptake, information on kinetics of mass-transfer can be gained. No significant differences were observed in terms of mass-transfer for ethylene and propylene. With increasing rubber content, effective diffusion coefficients increased slightly. By combined sorption studies with powder samples and compressed films, information about both effective diffusion coefficients and the effective length scale of diffusion could be gained. It could be shown, that the particle radius is not the characteristic length of diffusion in the studied powder samples. Mass transfer of nearly all samples could be described by a constant diffusion length of 120 to 130 µm, independently on particle size. This indicates that the effective scale of diffusion in polymer particles is in between microparticle and macroparticle scale used in classical particle modeling...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{migration}} behaviour of polymer additives in seventeen polypropylene (PP) samples is described. These samples {{cover the}} major types of PP used in food packaging. The diffusion coefficients of additives with relatively small molecular masses, Mr = 136 (limonene), {{as well as}} the migration of typical antioxidants used in PP up to Mr = 1178 (IRGANOX 1010) have been measured at different temperatures. In addition, the diffusion data and the percentages of xylene soluble fractions have been correlated. This enables one to predict the migration behaviour of a PP-sample by testing its “isotactic index” with xylene. The results clearly indicate that polypropylene can be subdivided, from the migration point of view, into the monophasic homopolymer (h-PP), monophasic random <b>copolymer</b> (r-PP) and <b>heterophasic</b> <b>copolymer</b> (heco-PP). The diffusion coefficients for r-PP are at least one order of magnitude higher than those of h-PP and comparable to the values for heco-PP. Upper limits for the diffusion values can be calculated based on the safety margin required by the consumer protection laws...|$|R
40|$|<b>Heterophasic</b> {{propylene}} <b>copolymers</b> (Hecoss) are versatile {{polymeric materials}} used in various applications such as automotive, packaging, construction industry among others. <b>Heterophasic</b> propylene <b>copolymers</b> consist of two main components: a polymer matrix of isotactic polypropylene and a dispersed rubbery ethylene-propylene copolymer, which is not miscible into the matrix phase. While the matrix improves stiffness, the elastomeric phase enhances the impact strength and the mechanical behavior at low temperature. <b>Heterophasic</b> propylene <b>copolymers</b> are produced in -at-least- two stage processes. In the first stage, starting from the catalyst particle, the homopolymer matrix is build, in the second stage, ethylene-propylene-rubber is polymerized into the polymer particle. The morphology of hiPP particles is of great interest {{for a number of}} reasons since the quantity of EPR, as well as the size and distribution of the rubber domains within the particles will have a great influence on the final properties of the polymer. Since the rubber formed in the second stage is sticky, rubber formation on the outer surface of the particle might lead to particle agglomeration and subsequent operational problems. Providing sufficient porosity for rubber accommodation in the heco-stage is one key element for avoiding these operational issues. Furthermore, particle morphology influences heat- and mass transfer within the polymer particles and therefore has an impact on reaction conditions at the active sites of the catalyst. The current contribution deals with the the effect of reaction conditions, in particular prepolymerization conditions, on resulting particle morphology and how the matrix particle morphology influences rubber incorporation in the heco-stage. Matrix polymerization in both bulk and gas-phase polymerization followed by a gas-phase polymerization of the rubber are discussed for two different Ziegler-Natta catalysts. The resulting particle morphology, transport properties and process kinetics are presented and compared. This research forms part of the research programme of the Dutch Polymer Institute (DPI), project 785...|$|R
40|$|Recently a wide {{spectrum}} of modifying polymeric materials have been test mixed with the bitumens used in road construction; among them, a new class of <b>heterophasic</b> polyolefin <b>copolymers</b> which show little stability when mixed with certain bitumens, especially when stored for long periods at high temperatures. The problem can be solved by adding phosphorous compounds, especially polyphosphoric acid, which shift the bitumen structure from sol to gel. In fact, it was demonstrated that the stability of polymer modified bitumens depends not only on the difference in density and viscosity between bitumen and polymer, but also on bitumen structure...|$|R
40|$|The surface {{adsorption}} of inorganic clays with ionic liquids {{has attracted}} much attention due to improve the interaction of hydrophilic clay with the hydrophobic polymers. However, successful organic adsorption strongly depends {{on the characteristics of}} ionic liquid (anion, chain size and concentration), and the reaction conditions (as polarity of solvent). In this study, such factors were analyzed and correlated with morphology, thermal and mechanical properties of the nanocomposites. The <b>heterophasic</b> ethylene-propylene <b>copolymer</b> nanocomposites were prepared by melt intercalation method in a twin screw co-rotating extruder. The halloysite nanotubes (HNT) was used as filler – natural and modified with different ionic liquids. The results showed that a better distribution and dispersion of the nanoparticles was achieved in the samples with modified HNT (m-HNT) and was more significant when the ionic liquid adsorption was conducted in a less polar solvent. The thermal stability of the nanocomposites with m- HNT was higher compared to the neat CP. Additionally, the better balance in the mechanical properties was obtained by the use of the more hydrophobic ionic liquid and higher concentration with improve of 27 % in the Young Modulus without loss in the impact properties at room temperature. These superior behaviors of ionic liquid adsorption products exhibit properties suitable for many industrial applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{target of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the structure-property relationships of <b>heterophasic</b> ethylenepropylene (EP) <b>copolymers</b> based on a single-site (metallocene) catalyst (SSC) supported with an emulsion technology developed by Borealis. The structure of these copolymers, their morphology evolution, as well as resulting mechanical properties were studied by varying the composition of the dispersed phase, i. e. the amorphous ethylene-propylene copolymer or rubber (EPR), in a systematic series of bench-scale products. Next to composition effects, an attempt was made to understand the key differences between products based on Ziegler-Natta catalysts (ZNC) and single-site catalysts (SSC) in terms of polymer structure and property profile. A remarkably different phase morphology with very good phase coupling to the matrix PP and the absence of crystallizable polyethylene in the ethylene-rich copolymers (EPR) was observed for the SSCbased grades, resulting in a high level of impact strength over a wide composition range...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} between binary combinations {{of three different}} elastomer classes commonly applied in impact modification of isotactic polypropylene (iPP) was studied. Blends based on a homogeneous ethylene-propylene (EP) random copolymer (EP-RACO) and a <b>heterophasic</b> EP impact <b>copolymer</b> comprising ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR) with different external elastomer types, one homogeneous ethylene- 1 -octene copolymer (EOC), and two hydrogenated styrenebutadiene-styrene triblock copolymers (SEBS) with different styrene content, were prepared. The phase morphology, mobility {{as a function of}} temperature, mechanical and optical properties were studied. Special effects could be achieved for the combination of two different elastomer types. The results clearly demonstrate the possibility to achieve attractive property combinations in ternary systems consisting of a crystalline PP matrix and two different types of elastomer, EPR or EOC {{on the one hand and}} SEBS on the other hand. A combination of density matching and compatibilization effects allows reaching good low temperature impact strength together with a transparency close to matrix level when selecting a butadiene-rich SEBS type...|$|R
