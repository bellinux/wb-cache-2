It was just boys and their penises, {{the same way with}} girls and vaginas and boobs. It wasn't out of desire." [...] LGBT group Stonewall released a statement praising Cumberbatch's comments, saying, [...] "Seeing someone in the public eye – especially somebody as influential as Benedict – talking positively around gay issues, is powerful for young lesbian, gay and bisexual people. It is often difficult for those growing up to find role models who demonstrate that it is equally okay to be gay or straight." ...|$|E
2500|$|Seinfeld co-creator Larry David based George {{largely on}} himself. Seinfeld and David created the {{character}} as a counterpoint to Seinfeld's character. In {{the first draft}} of the show's pilot script, called [...] "Stand-Up" [...] at the time, George's name was Bennett and he, like Jerry, was a comedian. In that same draft, the scene in the pilot in which George and Jerry discuss a woman Jerry met earlier, saw George and Jerry discussing their stand-up act. This idea however, was quickly abandoned and his name was changed to George, the real estate broker instead. George's last name comes from Michael Costanza, a college classmate of Seinfeld. [...] "Louis", George's middle name is a homage to Lou Costello, whose 1950s television series The Abbott and Costello Show, inspired Seinfelds writing style. Although he is often asked whether he wanted to play the character, Larry David has said that he was only interested in writing the show, that, not only did he not want to act on the show, but <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> him and, even if it had, he highly doubted that NBC would have approved of his being cast.|$|E

60|$|Coincident {{with this}} {{disappearance}} Jane's gardeners and {{workers in the}} alfalfa fields and stable men quit her, not even asking for their wages.

[...] "I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> insured in my life, because {{although}} I hear of fires {{every day in}} London, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> to me until lately {{that there was any}} probability of my house being burned.

He retired to his smoking-room, calling to St. Genis and to Crystal to follow him.|$|R
5000|$|Gelernter {{is known}} for his critiques of {{cultural}} illiteracy on America's college campuses. In 2015, he commented, [...] "They students know nothing about art. They know nothing about history. They know nothing about philosophy. And because they have been raised as not even atheists, they don’t {{rise to the level of}} atheists, insofar as they’ve never thought about the existence or nonexistence of God. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> to them.

"Perhaps <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> even to you, {{sharp as}} you are, that I {{could have taken}} society {{otherwise}} than at its own valuation of itself, as something much higher, more cultivated and refined than anything that I had been accustomed to.

You are the one person to whom I could speak, Lord Dorminster. You have not wished my suit well, but at least you have been clear-sighted.

5000|$|A {{letter from}} Arthur Ruppin to Hans Kohn in May 1930 states:"In the {{foundations}} of Brith Shalom one of the determining factors was that the Zionist aim has no equal example in history. The aim is to bring the Jews as second nation into a country which already is settled as a nation - and fulfill this through peaceful means. History has seen such penetration by one nation into a strange land only by conquest, but <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> that a nation will freely agree that another nation should come and demand full equality of rights and national autonomy at its side. The uniqueness of this case prevents its being, in my opinion, dealt with in conventional political-legal terms. It requires special contemplation and study. Brith Shalom should be the forum in which the problem is discussed and investigated." ...|$|R
60|$|So Christie made up {{her mind}} to accept, if this {{promotion}} was offered her; and while she waited, went through so many alternations of feeling, and was so harassed by doubts and fears that she sometimes found herself wishing <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> her.|$|E

5000|$|When {{it comes}} to the {{relationship}} between urban and rural areas, Carrefour is no exception to the rule. Generally, in all municipalities of Haiti, the urban center commonly called [...] "bouk or lavil" [...] depends on their communal sections - most often located in the mountainous areas - for their food and drinking water supply. Despite this dependence, the communal sections are still treated as the country outside. When at the town hall, the only time a resident of a communal section will hear about the town hall is before the municipal elections. Although the so-called urban dwellers live on resources from rural areas, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> to them that these resources are inexhaustible. Their contempt for the rural environment and the concentration of services in the urban area have contributed to the abandonment of the countryside: the rural exodus.|$|R

[...] "By taking such a step, even at your request, I {{should certainly}} express the opinion that the matter was one on which Parliament was entitled to expect that you should make an explanation. But my own opinion is that Parliament has no business to meddle in the matter. I do not think that every action of a minister's life should be made matter of inquiry because a newspaper may choose to make allusions to it. At any rate, if any word is said about it, it should, I think, be said in the other House." ...|$|R
