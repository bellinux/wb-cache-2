5|$|Bellinger is {{the only}} Ireland King of Arms known to have made any grants of arms. However two of his four known grants were annulled and or regranted, because their {{recipients}} were within the heraldic jurisdiction of other kings of arms. There is no <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> any Ireland Kings of Arms ever attempted to exercise control over the heraldic practice of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{different}} genera of oviraptorids {{have been}} found on or near elongatoolithid nests indicating that oviraptorid parents would brood on their eggs, most likely for extended periods of time. There is some <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> oviraptorid and troodontid eggs were cared for by the father, perhaps in a polygamous system. Given the large size of eggs relative to the parent, a mother would only lay two eggs at a time, so the eggs of a single nest may have been contributed by multiple females.|$|E
5|$|On 26 November, {{the detainees}} were deported, {{along with their}} families. Although this was an entirely German initiative—Quisling himself was left unaware {{although}} government assistance was provided—Quisling led the Norwegian public {{to believe that the}} first deportation of Jews, to camps in Poland, was his idea. A further 250 were deported in February 1943, and it remains unclear what the party's official position was on the eventual fate of the 759 Norwegian deportees. There is <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> Quisling honestly believed the official line throughout 1943 and 1944, that they were awaiting repatriation to a new Jewish homeland.|$|E
50|$|Bokermannohyla pseudopseudis is a saxicolous species. It is a generalist, {{with the}} diet {{consists}} of various arthropods, with spiders, beetles, and cockroaches {{being the most}} important food items. There is some <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> females are more choosy in their diet than males.|$|R
50|$|In {{molecular}} biology mir-200 microRNA {{is a short}} RNA molecule. MicroRNAs function to regulate the expression levels of other genes by binding and cleaving mRNAs or inhibiting translation. The miR-200 family contains miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-200c, miR-141, and miR-429. There are growing <b>evidences</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> miR-200 microRNAs are involved in cancer metastasis.|$|R

5|$|Some {{historians have}} {{suggested}} that the Games were alluded to in playwright William Shakespeare's The Merry Wives of Windsor, and used that as <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> Shakespeare may have seen the Games. But the allusion is not present in the quarto edition of 1602, making its first appearance in the posthumous First Folio of 1623, edited by Henry Condell and John Hemminges. It is therefore uncertain {{whether or not it was}} written by Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{listed the}} pyjama shark as Near Threatened, citing its small {{distribution}} {{and a recent}} increase in fishing pressure on small sharks in the region. However, there is no <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> its population has declined. There are no specific conservation measures in place for this species, though its range encompasses two marine reserves. The South African Sea Fisheries Research Institute is considering legally decommercializing the pyjama shark, which would limit {{the degree to which}} it can be targeted by commercial fisheries.|$|E
5|$|There is <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> psychoactive {{mushrooms}} {{have been}} used by humans in religious ceremonies for thousands of years. Murals dated 9000 to 7000BCE found in the Sahara desert in southeast Algeria depict horned beings dressed as dancers, clothed in garb decorated with geometrical designs, and holding mushroom-like objects. Parallel lines extend from the mushroom shapes {{to the center of the}} dancers' heads. 6,000-year-old pictographs discovered near the Spanish town of Villar del Humo illustrate several mushrooms that have been tentatively identified as Psilocybe hispanica, a hallucinogenic species native to the area.|$|E

50|$|The {{mechanism}} by which T7 DNA polymerase senses that a mismatched base has been incorporated is still a topic of study. However, some studies have provided <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> changes in tension of the template DNA strand caused by base-pair mismatch may induce exonuclease activation. Wuite et al. observed that applying tension of above 40 pN to the template DNA resulted in 100-fold increase in exonuclease activity.|$|R
40|$|Damages on the airfoil {{surface of}} {{compressor}} blades of an aircraft were analyzed. Analysis {{shows that the}} damages were caused due to impact of foreign object on the concave surface of the airfoil and hence, referred to as Foreign Object Damage (FOD). The nature of FOD <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> the blade was most probably hit by a feathery, soft, solid mass. There were no <b>evidences</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the FOD was caused by either metallic object or stones/pebbles...|$|R
5|$|Between 24 April and 1 May, the IX Army {{fought a}} desperate action {{to break out}} of the pocket in an attempt to link up with the XII Army. Hitler assumed that after a {{successful}} breakout from the pocket, the IX Army could combine forces with the XII Army and would be able to relieve Berlin. There is no <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> Generals Heinrici, Busse, or Wenck thought that this was even remotely strategically feasible, but Hitler's agreement to allow the IX Army to break through Soviet lines allowed many German soldiers to escape to the west and surrender to the United States Army.|$|E
5|$|Consistent {{condom use}} {{reduces the risk}} of HIV {{transmission}} by approximately 80% over the long term. When condoms are used consistently by a couple in which one person is infected, the rate of HIV infection is less than 1% per year. There is some <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> female condoms may provide an equivalent level of protection. Application of a vaginal gel containing tenofovir (a reverse transcriptase inhibitor) immediately before sex seems to reduce infection rates by approximately 40% among African women. By contrast, use of the spermicide nonoxynol-9 may increase the risk of transmission due to its tendency to cause vaginal and rectal irritation.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{reputation}} among his contemporaries for untruth and fantasy, Morrell has been defended by some later commentators who, while questioning his general reliability, maintain {{that not all}} his life was fraud and exaggeration. They believe that aside from the bombast and boastful tone of the account that carries his name, {{there is evidence that}} he carried out useful work, such his discovery of large-scale guano deposits which {{led to the development of}} a full-scale industry. He is believed to have died in 1838 or 1839, in Mozambique; there is, however, <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> this death might have been staged, and that he lived on in exile, possibly in South America.|$|E

5|$|During {{the period}} of English control over Scotland, there is some <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> King Edward I {{attempted}} to abolish Scottish laws that were contrary to English law, {{as he had done}} in Wales. Under Robert I in 1318, a parliament at Scone enacted a code of law that drew upon older practices, but it was also dominated by current events and focused on military matters and the conduct of the war. Nevertheless, the Act also codified procedures for criminal trials and protections for vassals from ejection from the land. From the fourteenth century, there are surviving examples of early Scottish legal literature, such as the Regiam Majestatem (on procedure at the royal courts) and the Quoniam Attachiamenta (on procedure at the baron courts), which drew on both common and Roman law.|$|E
5|$|It {{is clear}} that Othelake was no longer enjoying the office by 1420. By this time, John Kitley had been {{appointed}} to the post, though the exact date of his appointment is unknown. He was appointed by King Henry V of England on the insistence of the Earl of Ormonde. There is no <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> Kitley had any connection to Ireland, or even that he visited it, but his connection to Earl of Ormonde is interesting. Kitley was succeeded by Thomas Collyer, who had previously served as Clarenceux King of Arms and Lancaster Herald of Arms in Ordinary. Nothing is known of his career as Ireland, and he was succeeded by Thomas Ashwell.|$|E
5|$|Mental health {{consists}} of a broad scope of measurements of mental well being including depression, stress and measurements of self-worth. Numerous factors affect the prevalence of mental health disorders among women in India, including older age, low educational attainment, fewer children in the home, lack of paid employment and excessive spousal alcohol use. There is also <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> disadvantages associated with gender increase the risk for mental health disorders. Women who find it acceptable for men to use violence against female partners may view themselves as less valuable than men. In turn, this may lead women to seek out fewer avenues of healthcare inhibiting their {{ability to cope with}} various mental disorders.|$|E
25|$|A {{review in}} 2003 found the then-extant <b>evidence</b> {{sufficient}} <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> low serum levels of DHEA-S {{may be associated}} with coronary heart disease in men, but insufficient to determine whether prasterone supplementation would have any cardiovascular benefit.|$|R
40|$|Based on the {{transaction}} cost theory, this study proposes a research model that links trust, joint manufacturing activities, and supplier flexibility. In this model, supplier dependability trust and financial alignment {{are viewed as}} the key drivers of joint manufacturing activities between manufacturers and suppliers. These joint manufacturing activities, in turn, improve the supplier‟s ability to achieve manufacturing flexibility. Based on 208 responses from the suppliers in the U. S. and China, this study provides empirical <b>evidences</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> supplier dependability trust and financial alignment positively promote manufacturer-supplier joint manufacturing activities. The results also <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the joint manufacturing activities enhance supplier flexibility in a significant way...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{extends the}} {{previous}} works to further explore {{the role of}} the first order polarization tensor in electro-sensing by the weakly electric fish specifically for object discrimination and characterization. The first order polarization tensor for few objects used in the considered experiment are calculated and discussed to identify whether there are other <b>evidences</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> a weakly electric fish able to recognize the tensor when choosing or rejecting an object. Our findings in this study <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> all fish during most of the experiments face difficulties to discriminate two objects when their first order polarization tensors are almost similar depending on the types of training given to them...|$|R
5|$|Rumours {{of affairs}} did not {{surround}} only Bigge. In 1890, the sculptor Joseph Edgar Boehm died in Louise's presence at his studio in London, leading to rumours {{that the two}} were having an affair. Boehm's assistant, Alfred Gilbert, who {{played a central role}} in comforting Louise after Boehm's death, and supervised the destruction of Boehm's private papers, was rapidly promoted as a royal sculptor. Louise was also romantically linked to fellow artist Edwin Lutyens; her equerry, Colonel William Probert; and an unnamed music master. However, Jehanne Wake, Louise's biographer, argues that there is no substantial <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> Louise had sexual relationships with anyone other than her husband.|$|E
5|$|Some of Chopin's {{well-known}} pieces {{have acquired}} descriptive titles, {{such as the}} Revolutionary Étude (Op.10,No.12), and the Minute Waltz (Op.64,No.1). However, {{with the exception of}} his Funeral March, the composer never named an instrumental work beyond genre and number, leaving all potential extramusical associations to the listener; the names by which many of his pieces are known were invented by others. There is no <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the Revolutionary Étude was written with the failed Polish uprising against Russia in mind; it merely appeared at that time. The Funeral March, the third movement of his Sonata No. 2 (Op.35), the one case where he did give a title, was written before the rest of the sonata, but no specific event or death is known to have inspired it.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, the Annals of Tigernach {{states that}} Echmarcach succeeded Ímar. The Annals of the Four Masters specifies that Ímar was driven from the kingship by Echmarcach, {{who was then}} elected king by the Dubliners. After this point in Ímar's life, all that is known for certain is that he died in 1054, as recorded by the Annals of Ulster and the sixteenth-century Annals of Loch Cé. Nevertheless, since these sources style Ímar in Gaelic rí Gall ("king of the foreigners"), there may be <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that,</b> when Diarmait mac Maíl na mBó, King of Leinster (died 1072) drove Echmarcach from Dublin in 1052, Diarmait reinstalled Ímar as king.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} the name Panthers is uncertain. One {{of the most widely}} known {{theories}} is that the club were named for a squadron of Canadian airmen based near Nottingham during World War II. However, there is no <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> such a squadron existed and records indicate that the name was coined before these events could have taken place. A souvenir brochure produced to mark of the opening of the Ice Stadium in April 1939 stated that the venue's new team would be known as the Nottingham Panthers. It does not, however, explain the rationale behind the name. Three games were played by teams using the name Nottingham Panthers during the winter of 1939–40 before the name was revived in 1946.|$|E
5|$|The {{three species}} of vampire bats are all endemic to Latin America, {{and there is}} no <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> they had any Old World {{relatives}} within human memory. It is therefore impossible that the folkloric vampire represents a distorted presentation or memory of the vampire bat. The bats were named after the folkloric vampire rather than vice versa; the Oxford English Dictionary records their folkloric use in English from 1734 and the zoological not until 1774. The vampire bat's bite is usually not harmful to a person, but the bat has been known to actively feed on humans and large prey such as cattle and often leaves the trademark, two-prong bite mark on its victim's skin.|$|E
5|$|In 1111, Domnall mac Taidc {{appears to}} have forcefully seized the kingship of the Isles. Although it is {{possible}} that he had backing from Ua Briain himself, there is <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> made his move without Ua Briain's consent. Not long after this undertaking, Domnall {{appears to have}} been either forced from the Isles, or drawn back to Ireland in an attempt to capitalise on Ua Briain's failing health, only to be slain himself in 1115. The encroachment of competing Irish factions into the Isles may well have been as unpalatable to the English and Scots as the power vacuum left in the wake of Magnús' demise. Since the chronicle records that the subsequent reign of Óláfr lasted forty years, the latter's accession to the kingship appears to date to about 1112 or 1113, not long after Domnall launched his bid for the throne. In fact, the chronicle indicates that Óláfr spent his youth at the court of Henry I, King of England (died 1135), and it appears that this restoration of the Crovan dynasty, in the person of Lǫgmaðr's youngest brother, was the work of the English king.|$|E
40|$|Dividend tax reforms for REIT {{sector in}} Malaysia provide a rare {{opportunity}} to examine the impact of dividend taxation on firm valuation. It is found that dividend tax cut announcements result in positive abnormal returns. There are <b>evidences</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> REITs with a higher retail and institutional ownership representing the main beneficiaries of these tax cuts are associated with higher cumulative abnormal returns (CARs). It is also found that dividend payout increased significantly during the quarter immediately after the implementation of the first dividend tax cuts. These findings are consistent with the "old view" of dividend taxation which posits that dividend tax cut could affect firms' investment and payout policies...|$|R
