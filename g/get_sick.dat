5|$|The {{mandate and}} the limits on open {{enrollment}} were designed to avoid the insurance death spiral in which healthy people delay insuring themselves until they <b>get</b> <b>sick.</b> In such a situation, insurers would have to raise their premiums to cover the relatively sicker and thus more expensive policies, which could create a vicious cycle in which {{more and more people}} drop their coverage.|$|E
5|$|Abandoned {{by their}} father {{deep in a}} forest, young Hansel and Gretel enter a {{gingerbread}} house and are captured by a cannibalistic witch. The witch forces Hansel to continuously eat candy to fatten him up, and enslaves Gretel by ordering her to prepare the oven. The siblings outsmart her and incinerate her in the fire of the oven. In the fifteen years that follow, Hansel and Gretel become famed witch hunters, slaying hundreds of witches. The pair find that they are somehow immune to spells and curses, but the incident in the gingerbread house has left Hansel diabetic. He needs a shot of insulin every few hours or he will <b>get</b> <b>sick</b> and die.|$|E

In the meantime, Principal Seymour Skinner and Edna Krabappel attend and have a conversation which leads to them discovering that they have romantic feelings for each other. They end up kissing in Martin's pink playhouse in an act witnessed by Bart Simpson, who did not <b>get</b> <b>sick</b> since he fed his oysters to Martin's cat, along with Lisa who feigns sickness so she could leave without excuse.|$|E

500|$|... "My Happiness" [...] {{peaked at}} number 23 on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks, {{making it the}} first Powderfinger song to appear on a Billboard chart. According to Susan Groves of WHRL, part of the song's success came about because very few people knew of Powderfinger, but were drawn towards [...] "My Happiness" [...] because it was [...] "melodic, [...] pretty"—a change from what she {{described}} as [...] "middle of the road rock" [...] popular in the United States. Meanwhile, Australians were [...] "starting to <b>get</b> <b>sick</b> of My Happiness"—Cameron Adams argued in The Hobart Mercury that {{this was one of}} the reasons Powderfinger decided to focus on the offshore market.|$|E

The two eventually decided that causing Mulder to <b>get</b> <b>sick</b> in acts three and four would free up Duchovny for his episode. Walker noted, [...] "Mulder getting sick in Act Two and being in a hospital bed for Acts Three and Four was the direct result of his limited amount of time. It was easier to shoot a bunch of stuff of him in bed than having him have to be {{in a lot of different}} locations." ...|$|E

500|$|Although it {{had been}} {{reported}} {{for a number of}} years that Jackson had an abusive childhood, he first spoke openly about it in his 1993 interview with Oprah Winfrey. He grimaced when speaking of the childhood abuse at the hands of his father; he believed he had missed out on much of his childhood years, acknowledging that he often cried from loneliness. In the same interview, speaking of his father, Jackson said, [...] "There were times when he'd come to see me, I'd <b>get</b> <b>sick...</b> I'd start to regurgitate. I'm sorry... Please don't be mad at me... But I do love him." [...] In Jackson's other high profile interview Living with Michael Jackson (2003), he covered his face with his hand and began crying when talking about his childhood abuse.|$|E
500|$|With Internationalist, Powderfinger {{first set}} their sights overseas, {{appearing}} at numerous music festivals in the U.S., including South by Southwest in Texas. While in the U.S., Powderfinger played several showcase performances to record-label representatives in Los Angeles and New York City. In a later interview in Australia, Fanning said these shows were difficult {{due to the}} lack of any homegrown fan support. [...] He also said the band were not focused at the shows, and thus they did not go as well as he had hoped. Coghill, however, described the showcases, and the performances in Austin, as [...] "worthwhile" [...] and [...] "fun". After performing in the United States, Powderfinger completed a tour of Canada. Fanning described the band's overseas outlook as a necessity for an Australian-based band, as [...] "people [...] are going to <b>get</b> <b>sick</b> of you pretty quickly if you're going to do five tours a year, so that you can sustain yourself financially." ...|$|E
500|$|The move to {{the sixth}} series also meant Gaiman had to include Rory, who had ceased {{to exist in the}} {{original}} slot in the fifth series. With Rory included, Gaiman had to [...] "reshape" [...] much of {{the second half of the}} episode, featuring Amy being on the run in the TARDIS. In the original draft where Amy was the only companion, Gaiman added a [...] "heartbreaking monologue" [...] by the character, further stating [...] "you get to see what it's like to be the companion from the companion's point of view, and she got to talk about essentially in that version how sad it is, in some ways. One day something will happen to her, she'll get married, she'll get eaten by monsters, she'll die, she'll <b>get</b> <b>sick</b> of this, but he'll go on forever." [...] At a certain point, Gaiman became tired of rewriting drafts and asked Steven Moffat for help. Moffat wrote in what Gaiman called [...] "several of [...] best lines" [...] and rapidly rewrote several scenes when budget problems harmed filming locations.|$|E

500|$|Ferris Jabr of New Scientist {{approved}} of Contagion for accurately portraying the [...] "successes and frustrations" [...] of science. Jabr cites story {{elements such as}} [...] "the fact that before researchers can study a virus, they {{need to figure out}} how to grow it in cell cultures in the lab, without the virus destroying all the cells" [...] as examples of accurate depictions of science. Carl Zimmer, a science commentator, praised the film, stating, [...] "It shows how reconstructing the course of an outbreak can provide crucial clues, such as how many people an infected person can give a virus to, how many of them <b>get</b> <b>sick,</b> and how many of them die." [...] He also describes a conversation with the film's scientific consultant, W. Ian Lipkin, in which Lipkin defended the rapid generation of a vaccine in the film. Zimmer wrote that [...] "Lipkin and his colleagues are now capable of figuring out how to trigger immune reactions to exotic viruses from animals in a matter of weeks, not months. And once they've created a vaccine, they don't have to use Eisenhower-era technology to manufacture it in bulk." [...] Paul Offit, a pediatrician and vaccination expert, stated that [...] "typically when movies take on science, they tend to sacrifice the science in favor of drama. That wasn't true here." [...] Offit appreciated the film's usage of concepts such as R0 and fomites, as well as the fictional strain's origins, which was based on the Nipah virus.|$|E
