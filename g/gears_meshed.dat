40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{reliability}} when testing gear efficiency and on how <b>gear</b> <b>mesh</b> efficiency {{can be increased}} without {{detrimental effects on the}} gears. Test equipment commonly used in gear research was analysed to identify important parameters for gear efficiency testing. The effect of the bearing model's load-dependent losses on <b>gear</b> <b>mesh</b> efficiency was also investigated. Two different surface finishes of gears, ground and superfinished, were investigated to determine how two different load levels during running-in affect <b>gear</b> <b>mesh</b> efficiency and changes in surface roughness. Efficiency and gear temperature were also measured for ground and superfinished gears with dip lubrication, as well as two different forms of spray lubrication (before and after <b>gear</b> <b>mesh</b> contact). Tests on a gear test rig, showed that different assemblies of the same test setup can yield different measurements of torque loss. The applied bearing model had a significant effect on the estimated <b>gear</b> <b>mesh</b> efficiency. The mesh efficiency of ground gears is affected by the running-in procedure, with a higher running-in load resulting in a higher mesh efficiency than a lower load. This effect was not seen for superfinished gears, which show the same <b>gear</b> <b>mesh</b> efficiency for both running-in loads. Gearbox efficiency increased with spray lubrication rather than dip lubrication. The <b>gear</b> <b>mesh</b> efficiency increased, and thus gear temperatures were reduced, when superfinished gears were used rather than ground gears. A lower gear temperature was measured when gears were spray lubricated at the mesh inlet rather than the mesh outlet. QC 20170314 </p...|$|R

40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} {{which can be}} used to calculate dynamic gear tooth force and bearing forces. The model includes elastic bearings. The <b>gear</b> <b>mesh</b> stiffness and the path of contact are determined using the deformations of the gears and the bearings. This gives contact outside the plane-of-action and a time-varying working pressure angle. In a numerical example it is found that the only important vibration mode for the gear contact is the one where the gear tooth deformation is dominant. The bearing force variation, however, will be much more affected by the other vibration modes. The influence of the friction force is also studied. The friction has no dynamic influence on the gear contact force or on the bearing force in the <b>gear</b> <b>mesh</b> line-of-action direction. On the other hand, the changing of sliding directions in the pitch point is a source for critical oscillations of the bearings in the gear tooth frictional direction. These bearing force oscillations in the frictional direction appear unaffected by the dynamic response along the <b>gear</b> <b>mesh</b> line-of-action direction. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.
