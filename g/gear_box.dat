40|$|This {{report is}} a {{continuation}} of previous publications edited within the cooperation between Wikov Gear, s. r. o and IT ASCR and oriented on investigation of dynamic properties of four-planetary <b>gearing</b> <b>box</b> with fixed carrier of planet gears. Linear computing model of dynamic behaviour of <b>gearing</b> <b>box</b> {{is based on the assumption}} of solid gearing’s wheels, constant stiffness of bearings and of planets’ pins. Also the contact stiffness in gearings are supposed to be constant with the mean value. Due to the vide helical gearing with manifold contacts the periodical variability of contact stiffness is neglected. The very week support of sun wheel and elastic supports of planets and ring wheels results in the general plane motion of all wheels. periodicity of four-planetary gearing results in existence of several multiple eigen-frequencies in frequency spectrum. As the <b>gearing</b> <b>box</b> works always in connection with other aggregates, the simple models of driving and breaking systems were jointed to the input and output shafts. Eigen-frequency spectrum corresponding modes of vibrations and transfer functions among all elements were ascertained for this 20 DOF system. Numerical computing is completed by graphical records of eigen-modes as well as of transfer functions. ...|$|R
25|$|In the Australian Grand Prix, he and {{teammate}} Pedro de la Rosa {{were unable}} to qualify. In Malaysia, both the HRTs managed to qualify, with Karthikeyan starting 23rd due to a 5-place <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> penalty for Heikki Kovalainen, the start was wet and the HRTs gambled to start the race on full wet tyres, whilst the other cars started on intermediate tyres. As the rain increased that gamble paid off as other cars had to pit for full wets which promoted Karthikeyan to a points-paying tenth place before the safety car then red flag came out for heavy rain. At the restart, after a few laps more laps behind the safety car, the track was dry enough for intermediate tyres and a few drivers pitted as the safety car came back in, however Karthikeyan stayed out and was as high as 5th place at one point, before McLaren's Jenson Button crashed into him whilst they were racing for position. Karthikeyan suffered damage however, but he pitted for intermediate tyres which dropped him {{to the back of}} the field, bar teammate de la Rosa who had a served a drive-through penalty. On lap 47, Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel received a puncture after hitting Karthikeyan's front wing, whilst lapping him and Vettel was forced to pit and replaced the punctured tyre which put Vettel down from 4th place, finishing 11th; Karthikeyan finished the race in 21st, however he was given a 20-second post-race penalty for his part in the collision, which meant Karthikeyan dropped to 22nd and last, behind de la Rosa.|$|E

500|$|At {{the same}} time, the Faculty of Mechanisation and Motorisation of the Military Technical Academy named after F.E. Dzerzhinsky {{developed}} two tank models (TMM-1 and TMM-2) {{based on the}} Vickers 6-Ton tank design but with an American Hercules [...] six-cylinder water-cooled engine, improved front armour (to 15–20mm), and a driver's position on the left side. TMM stands for tank maloy moshchnosti or [...] "tank of low power". The TMM-1 was equipped with transmission details from the native [...] (...) and a ball mount for the DT tank machine gun {{in front of the}} hull, whereas the TMM-2 was equipped with an improved <b>gear</b> <b>box,</b> a steering device without clutches and a 37mm Hotchkiss gun in the right turret. Representatives from the main Soviet tank manufacturers together with officials from the RKKA Mobilization Department considered the Hercules engine to be too difficult to produce, and the engine tended to overheat inside the engine compartment. Tests of TMM-1 and TMM-2 prototypes performed in the beginning of 1932 demonstrated no advantage over the Vickers 6-Ton and the T-26 (the TMM-2's maneuverability was found to be even worse).|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the limited}} fuel allowance, the cars were towed to the start line by horses. The first car, a Rolls-Royce being driven by Charles Rolls, started at 9am, and the {{following}} 41 cars were released at one minute intervals. Due to the fuel-saving nature of the event most of the drivers began the race by letting their car coast down the initial slope under its own momentum before engaging gear. Early on the first lap of the race Rolls heard a crunching noise from his <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> and the car stopped. He claimed that upon investigation he discovered that small nuts and screws had been dropped into the gearbox, which had smashed a gear. Rolls claimed that this [...] "was a common trick abroad" [...] but voiced surprise at it happening in an English race. There was further speculation of foul play when {{it was discovered that}} Arnott's Minerva had been tampered with; two spark plugs had been smashed and an air valve bent, causing his engine to overheat. Before the race Rolls and Arnott had been two of the favourites, and The Automobile magazine said that [...] "this unfortunate incident has greatly detracted from the success of the race." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{prototype}} was manufactured from {{spare parts}} and equipment scavenged from other light tanks, and featured a rectangular turret with 16millimetre (0.6in) basic armor. The chassis {{was divided into}} four quarters, with the forward right half occupied by the engine, <b>gear</b> <b>box,</b> clutch and final drive, beside the driver. The rear half of the vehicle was taken up mostly by the turret basket and forty-six 45millimetre rounds, {{as well as two}} 60 liter (13 Imp gal) fuel tanks. Turret space was used by the tank commander-gunner and the loader, as well as the 45millimetre model 1932 anti-tank gun and two MG-13 machine guns. The main gun was originally commissioned as the Soviet 45millimetre 19K anti-tank gun in March 1932, and featured heavier ammunition and a faster rate of fire than older anti-tank guns. Starting in 1934, a newer model began to be fitted into newly assembled T-26s. Apart from the gun, the tank commander's model 1932 panoramic periscope was also scavenged from a T-26. The vehicle was powered by a Ford Model 48 engine taken from a civilian automobile, displacing 3,622cc (221 in3) and producing 85hp (63kW) at 2,000rpm. The engine was paired with a brand-new radiator and exhaust system. The Verdeja prototype used the Panzer I's Aphon PG-31 gearbox, although this worked at excessive revolutions for the engine, offering less torque which made slopes greater than 40° difficult. Possibly the most unusual features of the Verdeja were the suspension and tracks. [...] To prevent the tank's tracks slipping off the roadwheels, two track pieces were fitted together to create a central groove for the roadwheel to travel in. With a weight of under [...] the Verdeja had a maximum speed of [...] and a combat radius of [...] Following the prototype's success in testing between 10 January and 20 January 1939, Captain Verdeja was ordered to begin construction of the definitive model of the light tank.|$|E

2500|$|The unusual {{aspects of}} the design were the {{butterfly}} or V-tail and engine layout that led to its popular nickname, [...] "Twin Quad." [...] The four engines were buried in the wings, with each pair of engines connected to a single propeller via clutches and a common <b>gear</b> <b>box.</b> The engines were horizontally opposed eight-cylinder air-cooled Lycoming GSO-580s (GSO denoting Geared Supercharged and Opposed, with each engine featuring a built-in reduction <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> {{in addition to the}} common propeller <b>gear</b> <b>box).</b> The engines were rated at 400 horsepower at 3,300 rpm. The tail was unusual because unlike the vertical and two horizontal surfaces found on most aircraft, the Twin-Quad's was a two-surface V-tail similar to the tail fitted to Beechcraft's other new product at the time, the Model 35 Bonanza. The V-tail configuration was flight-tested on a twin-engine Beech AT-10.|$|E
