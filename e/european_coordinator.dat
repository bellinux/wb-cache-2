40|$|The European Commission {{has adopted}} a {{proposal}} to develop the trans-European network for freight and passenger transports (TEN-T). A multimodal core transport network for Europe has been proposed, {{as part of the}} TEN-T (including all modes of transport; roads, railways, airports and canals). As parts of the core network, ten core network corridors have been appointed. They will be used as instruments for implementing the entire core network. <b>European</b> <b>Coordinators</b> will facilitate the implementation of the core network corridors, in cooperation with corridor platforms to be established by Member States concerned. There is no overall solution to how this core network with partly appointed network corridors would be managed, and how the corridor platforms will be synthesized and inter-organized to accomplish seamless transnational transport solutions. This literature review pinpoints three areas of specific importance for future work in creating transport corridor management structures. First, broad stakeholders inclusion, where formalized partnerships in agreements are suggested. Second, several ways of communication between stakeholders to ensure common progress, and third, to complement the dominant causation processes with effectuation processes to capture the stakeholders own driving forces towards common goals.

40|$|In December 2013, the new European {{transport}} infrastructure {{policy has been}} launched through {{the adoption of the}} new TEN-T (Trans European Transport Network) guidelines, and throughout to the “Connecting Europe Facility” as the related funding instruments. The previous TEN-T regulation achieved certain successes in cross border infrastructure. However, the revision is necessary {{for the development of the}} internal market and to allow the achievement of the Europe 2020 objectives (reduction of CO 2, removing bottlenecks from transport chains that limit the smooth functioning of the European internal market and the regular flows of passengers and goods, etc.), translated as a more sustainable, green, efficient energy, safe and secure EU Transport. In order to support the implementation of the Core network Corridors, the new Regulation contains specific tools: Corridors and Coordinators. The corridors will allow bringing together all relevant stakeholders (such as Member States, regions, local authorities, infrastructure managers, port authorities, and users) under the leadership of a <b>European</b> <b>coordinator</b> and concentrate on cross border sections, intermodality and interoperability. The TENT revision aims to establish and develop an integrated trans-European transport network which covers the infrastructure for all transport modes, ensures the functioning of the internal market and strengthens economic and social cohesion. This paper introduces the WiderMoS project, an initiative promoted by the TEN-T program through the INEA “Innovation and Network Executive Agency”, and developed by 5 EU countries and 16 institutions leaded by La Spezia Port Authority, which will meet interoperability among some of the nine Priority Core Network Corridors, from west Mediterranean countries to central – north Europe, promoting the integration of {{transport infrastructure}}s (port, road and rail), information structures (info-structures: Port Community Systems and Single Window Services) and transport actors, from a Business to Business (B 2 B) point of view, in a private – public action. The main outcomes of the project are to efficiently and commercially exploit the corridors drawn by the TEN-T making European economy more competitive, efficient and smart.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} {{governance}} for developing main transport corridors in the European Union was examined {{by means of}} document- and literature studies. European Union transport policy documents were studied as well as legislation regarding development of the trans-European transport network (TEN-T). One of the most strategic parts of the TEN-T, the Scandinavian – Mediterranean (ScanMed) transport corridor, was particularly studied with documents concerning the implementation of ScanMed. Qualitative content analyses have been conducted and three themes consisting of “governance organisation”, “actors” and “governance in practical implementation process” were studied. It was concluded that {{a broad range of}} stakeholders have to contribute in order to accomplish a well-functioning transport system. Accordingly the studied policy, legislative and implementation documents all concern governance matters in various ways. Depending on the actual transport initiative, and its objectives, stakeholder involvement can vary. A framework for governance arrangements for the most strategic parts of TEN-T, the Core network corridors is set in a regulation. A <b>European</b> <b>coordinator</b> was appointed for each Core network corridor and has an important role in facilitating the implementation. Such governance structure was already foreseen in earlier policy documents. Corridor forum is a new tool aiming to bring key stakeholders together for consultative purposes and in addition working groups can be connected to the Corridor forums. The policy and legislative documents have a focus on the responsibilities and activities for the European Commission and the concerned Member states. The importance of other stakeholders such as cities, ports, regional authorities, private actors is mentioned, but their activities are not explicitly stated in these formal European documents. However, participation of various stakeholders in the ScanMed Core network corridor implementation process is tangible, especially when concrete projects are discussed. Further, in the ScanMed Core network corridor implementation process the Corridor forum is explored as a new tool for bringing stakeholders together, progressively reaching an increasing number of stakeholders, including users of infrastructure in future stages. Encompassing eight countries and several modes of transport a large number of stakeholders are indicated. The idea of future ideas laboratories acting as meeting spots for development of the transport corridor on specific topics, and bringing a variety of stakeholders together, is interesting. A key challenge for future implementation of the ScanMed Core network corridor is the large number of stakeholders concerned by a transnational and multimodal transport system. Governance design to strengthen involvement of stakeholders in European transports initiatives such as the TEN-T should be encouraged. Suitable forums for cooperation and collaboration for inclusiveness for various actors need to be elaborated, where common overarching objectives need to be agreed upon. These forums have to be developed together with concerned stakeholders so that choice of forum is suitable due to its expected function. Key stakeholders which can actively contribute to progress and new ideas need to be connected to the process. And developed working groups, ideas laboratories and similar, on a geographical basis for parts of the corridor or for a specific topic, need to be adequately bridged to a European level...|$|E

40|$|Creating the {{framework}} for cross-border infrastructure cooperation often requires the active role of a third party, an honest broker, to forge convergence of interests. It is often argued that deep European Union (EU) -style integration is a necessary, though not sufficient, condition for successful cross-border infrastructural cooperation. The EU institutions, in particular the European Commission and the European Investment Bank (EIB), have performed such a facilitating and enabling role, though not without encountering challenges along the way. However, this paper argues that the EU experience underscores the vital importance of national governments and good governance {{in the context of}} cross-border multinational infrastructure. Hence, the authors argue that deep EU-style integration is an enabling but not a strictly necessary condition for successful implementation of cross-border infrastructure projects. The authors take issue with the myth that transnational cross-border infrastructure cooperation is the result of supra-national decision-making at the EU level. For a particular cross-border infrastructure project to succeed requires tri-partite and multilateral initiatives. These may take the form of coordinators (akin to the <b>European</b> <b>Coordinators</b> for TEN-T projects) or special-purpose state-owned companies alongside the Asian (and/or other) Development Banks as co-owners. The second myth which this paper seeks to address is that the management of trans- national and cross-border infrastructure is primarily supra-national. Although additional co-financing may be sought from the European Community budget and/or the European Investment Bank, these resources always complement national budgetary allocations and private funding. Contingent liabilities always remain at the national and sub-national levels and never at the supra-national EU level. The implications for management of cross-border multinational infrastructure in Asia, where {{the framework}} for regional cooperation is not yet well articulated, are to some extent positive. Within the Asian context, the need for an honest broker can be fulfilled by multi-lateral institutions such as the Asian Development Bank and the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN ESCAP). They can appoint coordinators drawing on the growing pool of top-level decision makers in Asia. Most importantly, these initiatives can be realized within the present-day context of Asia's shallow integration...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE To develop internationally {{harmonised}} standards for programmes {{of training in}} intensive care medicine (ICM). METHODS Standards were developed by using consensus techniques. A nine-member nominal group of European intensive care experts developed a preliminary set of standards. These were revised and refined through a modified Delphi process involving 28 <b>European</b> national <b>coordinators</b> representing national training organisations {{using a combination of}} moderated discussion meetings, email, and a Web-based tool for determining the level of agreement with each proposed standard, and whether the standard could be achieved in the respondent's country. RESULTS The nominal group developed an initial set of 52 possible standards which underwent four iterations to achieve maximal consensus. All national coordinators approved a final set of 29 standards in four domains: training centres, training programmes, selection of trainees, and trainers' profiles. Only three standards were considered immediately achievable by all countries, demonstrating a willingness to aspire to quality rather than merely setting a minimum level. Nine proposed standards which did not achieve full consensus were identified as potential candidates for future review. CONCLUSIONS This preliminary set of clearly defined and agreed standards provides a transparent framework for assuring the quality of training programmes, and a foundation for international harmonisation and quality improvement of training in ICM...|$|R
