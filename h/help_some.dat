5|$|A {{small number}} of Dakota Native Americans managed to return to Minnesota in the 1880s and {{establish}} communities near Granite Falls, Morton, Prior Lake, and Red Wing. However, after this time Dakota people were no longer allowed to reside in Minnesota {{with the exception of}} the meritorious Sioux called the Loyal Mdewakanton. This separate class of Dakota did not participate in the Dakota War of 1862, since they were assimilated Christians and instead decided to <b>help</b> <b>some</b> of the missionaries escape the Sioux warriors who chose to fight.|$|E
5|$|Deane was {{commissioned}} into the Royal Army Medical Corps in 1911, {{after a period}} as house surgeon at the Adelaide Hospital, Dublin. In 1913, he was posted to India and served in Burma. He was stationed in Meerut {{at the start of}} the First World War. From there, he travelled to France with the Garhwal Brigade of the Indian Expeditionary Force, landing in Marseille in September 1914. He was deployed immediately to the Western Front, where he served first with the 20th Field Ambulance and then as medical officer of the 2nd Battalion, The Royal Leicestershire Regiment. His unit saw much active service. On 22 August 1915, he was awarded the Military Cross after running out under machine gun fire to rescue four men who had been wounded by artillery fire. A month later, his regiment participated in the Battle of Loos, and was almost entirely obliterated. He was shot dead after going to <b>help</b> <b>some</b> injured soldiers: his action earned him a mention in despatches. Deane was one of 60 RCSI doctors to receive the Military Cross in the First World War, and one of 17 to be killed in action.|$|E

5|$|Midway through season three, Kate persuades Rousseau to <b>help</b> <b>some</b> of the {{survivors}} find the Others' home, by informing her that Alex helped her escape from the Others. When they arrive, Rousseau abandons the group and watches from the bushes as Alex walks past. A few days later, Rousseau leads {{the survivors}} to the radio tower {{in order for them}} to contact a nearby freighter. En route, they encounter Ben and Alex; Ben explains to Alex who Rousseau is and the mother and daughter are reunited. Season four begins with the survivors dividing into two groups, with those who believe the people from the freighter to be dangerous, including Rousseau and Alex, joining Locke (Terry O'Quinn). After learning of the freighter crew's intentions to kill everyone on the island, Ben directs Rousseau, along with Alex and her boyfriend Karl (Blake Bashoff), to head to the Temple where the rest of the Others are located. On their way, Rousseau and Karl are shot by unseen attackers, and both are killed. The buried bodies of both are discovered by Miles (Ken Leung), Sawyer (Josh Holloway), and Claire after they leave Locke and travel back to the beach.|$|E

25|$|Many people grieve without {{professional}} <b>help.</b> <b>Some,</b> however, {{may seek}} additional support from licensed psychologists or psychiatrists.

In the United States of America, local hospice agencies may provide a first contact for those seeking bereavement support.|$|E
25|$|What really invigorates this novel, though, {{is the way}} it {{alternates}} between Claire's chapters and chapters {{narrated by}} Lola, her 50-year-old Filipino nanny. I was worried early on that Lola would be a Southeast Asian version of the Magical Negro, who exists merely to <b>help</b> <b>some</b> self-absorbed white person reach enlightenment. But she's entirely her own wonderful, troubled character, and her relationship with Claire remains complex and unresolved.|$|E

25|$|Several {{countries}} have taken measures {{to control the}} consumption of tobacco with usage and sales restrictions as well as warning messages printed on packaging. Additionally, smoke-free laws that ban smoking in public places such as workplaces, theaters, and bars and restaurants reduce exposure to secondhand smoke and <b>help</b> <b>some</b> people who smoke to quit, without negative economic effects on restaurants or bars. Tobacco taxes that increase the price is also effective, especially in developing countries.|$|E
25|$|Another {{option is}} {{self-help}} based on principles of cognitive-behavioral therapy. Using {{a book or}} a website, a person does the kinds of exercises {{that would be used}} in therapy, but they do it on their own, perhaps with some email or phone support from a therapist. A systematic analysis of trials testing this kind of self-help found that websites, books, and other materials based on cognitive-behavioral therapy could <b>help</b> <b>some</b> people. The best-studied conditions are panic disorder and social phobia.|$|E

25|$|Physical {{therapy and}} {{occupational}} therapy {{may help to}} reduce tremor and improve coordination and muscle control for some patients. A physical therapist and/or occupational therapist will evaluate the patient for tremor positioning, muscle control, muscle strength, and functional skills. Teaching the patient to brace the affected limb during the tremor or to hold an affected arm close to the body is sometimes useful in gaining motion control. Coordination and balancing exercises may <b>help</b> <b>some</b> patients. Some occupational therapists recommend the use of weights, splints, other adaptive equipment, and special plates and utensils for eating.|$|E

25|$|When the war ended, {{both the}} occupying powers and the {{families}} of the deceased began trying to learn {{what had happened to the}} bodies of those executed. In many cases it was impossible, as documentation was unavailable and what bodies and samples remained were rarely identifiable. The identities of those Stieve did his research on only became known almost 70 years after the war when a list he had compiled in 1946 for a Protestant minister trying to <b>help</b> <b>some</b> of the relatives of Plötzensee inmates find their remains. They were published in a medical journal by another researcher, Sabine Hildebrandt.|$|E

25|$|The Gräfenberg spot, or G-spot, is a debated area {{of female}} anatomy, {{particularly}} among doctors and researchers, {{but it is}} typically described as being located behind the female pubic bone surrounding the urethra and accessible through the anterior wall of the vagina; it and {{other areas of the}} vagina are considered to have tissue and nerves that are related to the clitoris. Besides the shared anatomy of the aforementioned sensory nerves, orgasm by indirect stimulation of the clitoris or G-spot area through anal penetration may be aided by the close proximity between the vaginal cavity and the rectal cavity. Direct stimulation of the clitoris, a G-spot area, or both, during anal sex can <b>help</b> <b>some</b> women enjoy the activity and reach orgasm from it.|$|E
50|$|During early 1944, the collaborationist press, such as Je suis partout, {{attacked}} Bousquet, {{accusing him}} of having served in the Vichy administration only to favour the Resistance. His cabinet director, , {{was reported to have}} also <b>helped</b> <b>some</b> Resistance networks.|$|R
