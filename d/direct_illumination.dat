2500|$|While the <b>direct</b> <b>illumination</b> is {{generally}} best sampled using eye-based ray tracing, certain indirect effects {{can benefit from}} rays generated from the lights. Caustics are bright patterns caused by the focusing of light off a wide reflective region onto a narrow area of (near-)diffuse surface. [...] An algorithm that casts rays directly from lights onto reflective objects, tracing their paths to the eye, will better sample this phenomenon. This integration of eye-based and light-based rays is often expressed as bidirectional path tracing, in which paths are traced from both the eye and lights, and the paths subsequently joined by a connecting ray after some length.|$|E

2500|$|The word {{spectrograph}} {{had become}} part of the international scientific vocabulary by 1884. Early spectrometry devices that measured the mass-to-charge ratio of ions were called mass spectrographs which consisted of instruments that recorded a spectrum of mass values on a photographic plate. A mass spectroscope is similar to a mass spectrograph except that the beam of ions is directed onto a phosphor screen. A mass spectroscope configuration was [...] used in early instruments when it was desired that the effects of adjustments be quickly observed. Once the instrument was properly adjusted, a photographic plate was inserted and exposed. The term mass spectroscope continued to be used even though the <b>direct</b> <b>illumination</b> of a phosphor screen was replaced by indirect measurements with an oscilloscope. The use of the term mass spectroscopy is now discouraged due to the possibility of confusion with light spectroscopy. Mass spectrometry is often abbreviated as mass-spec or simply as MS.|$|E

As {{part of the}} Collaborative Research Center 653 which investigates micro-structured metallic surfaces for inherent mechanical data storage, we research into a stable and reliable optical readout of the written data. Since this comprises a qualitative surface reconstruction, we use <b>directed</b> <b>illumination</b> to make the micro structures visible. Then we apply a spectral analysis to obtain image partitioning and perform signal tracking enhanced by a customized Hidden Markov Model. In this paper, we derive the algorithms used and demonstrate reading data from a surface with 1. 6 kbit/cm 2 from a micro-structured groove which varies by only 3 µm in depth (thus a “scratch”). We demonstrate the system’s robustness with experiments with real and artificially-rendered surfaces. ...|$|R

An optical detector configuration is {{used to determine the}} direction of the reflected beam. This direction describes the angular position of the surface against the measuring system. The relation between coordinate system of the tool in the illuminated spot and the reference system of the optical measuring device is determined by a second setup. Both optical angle measurement and the determination of the coordinate systems lead to the measurement of the cutting edge angles.

40|$|In this paper, a new {{algorithm}} for {{detection of}} synthesis errors due do object shading under <b>directed</b> <b>illumination</b> for object [...] based analysis [...] synthesis coding (OBASC) is presented. The idea of OBASC is to transmit luminances and chrominances only in image regions of model failure. In these regions, synthesis errors are visible between a real {{image of an}} image sequence and the decoded image synthesized from formerly transmitted parameters describing object shape, object motion, object colour, and scene illumination. In this contribution, synthesis errors due to object shading are detected by a local analysis of the luminance ratio between real anddecodedimage based {{on the model of}} diffuse reflection. The detected errors are assessed as "non disturbing", thus transmission of luminancesand chrominances is avoided for them.

This method uses a multiplexing scheme similar to the idea of the theoretical lower bound in Section 4. 1 in the paper, except that it uses high frequency sinusoidal patterns instead of checkerboard patterns since read light sources cannot produce perfect step edges.

40|$|The {{posterior}} light {{organ and}} eyestalk of the midwater shrimp, Sergestes similis Hansen, {{are capable of}} 140 ° of angular movement within the body during pitch body tilt, maintaining the organs at near horizontal orienta-tions. Counter-rotations compensate for 74 - 80 % of body inclination. These responses are statocyst mediated. Unilateral statolith ablation reduces compensation by 50 %. There is no evidence for either homo-lateral or contralateral control by the single functioning statocyst. Bilateral lith ablation abolishes counter-rotation. Light organ and eyestalk orienta-tions are unaffected by the direction of imposed body tilt. Bioluminescence is emitted downward from horizontal animals with an angular distribution similar to the distribution of oceanic light. The amount of downward directed luminescence in tilted animals decreases at large angles of body inclination due to less than total compensation by the light organs. Eye turning towards a light source is induced by upward-directed illumination. The resulting change in eyestalk orientations never amounts to more than 25 °. The turning is abolished by bilateral statolith ablation. Downward <b>directed</b> <b>illumination,</b> comparable in intensity to oceanic light, generally does not generate significant eye turning.
