40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this talk}} is to present some {{numerical}} techniques to solve the equa-tions arising in Electrocardiology. In particular we consider the Bidomain equations for the transmembrane and extracellular potentials coupled with the Luo-Rudy model that describes the ionic dynamics across the membrane at the cellular level. The Bidomain model consists of degenerate, quasi-linear, parabolic equations. It {{can be derived from}} a homogenization of the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>laws</b> for the potential in the intracellular and extracellular space. The Luo-Rudy model consists of a stiff system of ordinary differential equations. The intrinsic complexity of the coupled problem requires ad hoc numerical methods.

40|$|Since {{the energy}} density of {{lithium-ion}} batteries is reaching its ceiling so that improvements are just of minor nature, researchers have moved their focus to systems beyond lithium-ion. One {{of the most}} promising candidates besides the lithium-air technology for future energy storage both for automotive and stationary applications are lithium-sulfur batteries. The use of sulfur as an active material offers many benefits compared to lithium-ion systems. First of all sulfur is expected to deliver a specific capacity as high as 1675 Ah kg- 1 for a complete electrochemical conversion reaction with lithium. The rather low operation potential of such a cell is more than offset by such high specific capacity, which leads to a theoretical energy density of around 2600 Wh kg- 1, a value approximately 4 - 5 folds higher than for current lithium-ion cells [1]. Further sulfur is naturally abundant, low in price, non toxic and owns an intrinsic overload protection [2]. Despite all advantages of lithium-sulfur batteries and ongoing research over many decades a commercialization has not succeeded. Occurring problems are a high selfdischarge-rate, low charging efficiency and a short cycle life. All challenges in operating lithium-sulfur cells are correlated with lithium polysulfides, which are intermediate reduction products when lithium reacts with sulfur [3]. These lithium polysulfides, particularly those with longer chain length, are soluble in common liquid electrolytes. So after being formed at the cathode and the dissolution process, polysulfides are moving through the electrolyte to the anode, where they are further reduced, then moving back to the cathode generating a redox shuttle. Insoluble Li 2 S and Li 2 S 2 precipitate on the anode. This reduces the available active sulfur and results in corrosion and polarization of the anode. Recent approaches to overcome these issues are for one protecting the anode from reacting with lithium polysulfides or for another hindering the movement of lithium polysulfides with MPLs or a structuring of the cathode [4]. To adress the latter, we present a thermodynamically consistent continuum model for nanostructured sulfur carbon composite cathodes. The ideal case is investigated, where all lithium polysulfides are confined within carbon particles. Particular emphasis is put to the adsorption of Li ions on the carbon particle surface and the preceding removal of the solvation shell. We use a consistent mathematical description of charge accumulation at the interface to cover the influence of the electrochemical doublelayer. This double-layer model is derived from fundamental thermodynamic and <b>electrostatic</b> <b>laws.</b> No structural properties of the double-layer are presumed. Therefore, the double-layer model gives insight into the underlying mechanisms at the electrode-electrolyte interface. This model is applied to our previous work [5], where an unexpected transport of lithium ions against a concentration gradient into the particles was observed. We investigate the interaction between the osmotic pressure inside the particles due to the transport of lithium ions and surface processes like adsorption and desolvation. This allows to connect surface effects with the overall performance of lithium-sulfur cells. References: [1] S. S. Zhang, J. Power Sources 231, 153 - 162, (2013). [2] L. F. Nazar et al., J. Mater.

40|$|This work revisits the {{classical}} concept of electric energy {{and suggests that}} the common definition is likely to generate large errors when dealing with nanostructures. For instance, deriving the electrostatic energy in semiconductors using the traditional formula fails at giving the correct electrostatic force between capacitor plates and reveals {{the existence of an}} extra contribution to the standard electrostatic energy. This additional energy is found to proceed from the generation of space charge regions which are predicted when combining <b>electrostatics</b> <b>laws</b> with semiconductor statistics, such as for accumulation and inversion layers. On the contrary, no such energy exists when relying on electrostatics only, as for instance when adopting the so-called full depletion approximation. The same holds for charged or neutral insulators that are still consistent with the customary definition, but which are in fact singular cases. In semiconductors, this additional free energy can largely exceed the energy gained by the dipoles, thus becoming the dominant term. Consequently, erroneous electrostatic forces in nanostructure systems such as for MEMS and NEMS as well as incorrect energy calculations are expected using the standard definition. This unexpected result clearly asks for a generalization of electrostatic energy in matter in order to reconcile basic concepts and to prevent flawed force evaluation in nanostructures with electrical charges.

40|$|The paper {{studies the}} {{physical}} {{relationship between the}} main objects of the magnetic field in a continuous medium with magnetization effects. Consistently considers the following hypotheses: a hypothesis of the primacy and the physical reality of the magnetization vector field environment, a similar hypothesis about the real existence of Ampere currents (molecular currents, magnetization currents), a hypothesis of a magnetic dipole moment of the medium volume element in view of bulk density of electric currents in this volume. A more rigorous derivation of the basic differential equations of magnetostatics from the Biot-Savart-Laplace equation is proposed. The well-known works justifying basic equations of magnetostatics use a procedure wherein when proving the local differential ratio is used a transformation of some volume integral to the surface integral bounding this volume. Thus, there is a specific way to select a closed surface that is either a surface in a vacuum (beyond the medium volume under consideration), or a surface of the conductor (a normal component of currents to the surface, here, becomes zero). In the paper the control surface is arbitrarily carried out within {{the volume of the}} medium under consideration, thereby leading to the mathematically sound result. The paper analyzes the hypotheses listed above. The main feature of analysis is a succesively using concept of bilateralism surface bounding the medium volume of the arbitrary finite dimensions.
