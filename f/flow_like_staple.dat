50|$|Quark-gluon plasma {{is a very}} {{high-temperature}} {{phase in}} which quarks become free and able to move independently, rather than being perpetually bound into particles, {{in a sea of}} gluons, subatomic particles that transmit the strong force that binds quarks together. This is analogous to the liberation of electrons from atoms in a plasma. This state is briefly attainable in extremely high-energy heavy ion collisions in particle accelerators, and allows scientists to observe the properties of individual quarks, and not just theorize. Quark-gluon plasma was discovered at CERN in 2000. Unlike plasma, which <b>flows</b> <b>like</b> a gas, interactions within QGP are strong and it <b>flows</b> <b>like</b> a liquid.|$|R
