5|$|Bina Agarwal and Pradeep Panda {{illustrate}} that a woman's property status (such as owning {{a house or}} land) directly and significantly reduces her chances of experiencing domestic violence, while employment makes little difference. They argue that such immovable property increases women's self-esteem, economic security, and strengthens their fall-back positions, enhancing their options and bargaining clout. They show that property ownership is an important contributor to women's <b>economic</b> <b>well-being</b> because it reduces their susceptibility to violence.|$|E

Smaller, poorer farms might combine barns and dwelling houses, have simpler storage areas, and use the facilities of other farms for activities {{they could not afford}} to build houses for.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the Arab Revolt and its aftermath, Aleppo's {{political}} elite was divided between those who embraced the Arab nationalist movement led by Faisal and those who sought political autonomy for Aleppo and its hinterland within the Ottoman state. A number of factors distinguished the attitudes of Aleppo's elite and populace from those of Damascus. For one, the <b>economic</b> <b>well-being</b> of Aleppo's inhabitants was dependent on open, commercial access to Aleppo's Anatolian hinterland, which was predominantly populated by Turks; southwestern Anatolia was the principal market for Aleppo's goods and the principal supplier of its food and raw materials.|$|E

5|$|A 2002 study {{conducted}} by CARE International across three districts in the Central Region of Malawi considers how HIV/AIDS has affected <b>economic</b> <b>well-being</b> in rural Malawi. When skilled laborers are infected with HIV, they are usually unable to work; therefore, they often shift agricultural production on their land to less labor-intensive crops, sacrificing the opportunity to grow more profitable, labor-intensive crops such as tobacco. When family members fall ill with HIV/AIDS, their relatives invest time in their treatment and care, further reducing household productivity. In addition, when family members are infected with HIV, households often use the money they would normally invest in agriculture to cover medical expenses, further decreasing economic stability at the household level. Finally, when adults contract HIV, their children often remain home from school {{to work in the}} fields, threatening long-term productivity and economic advancement in Malawi.|$|E
5|$|Attachment {{theory has}} {{implications}} in residence and contact disputes, and applications by foster parents to adopt foster children. In the past, particularly in North America, the main theoretical framework was psychoanalysis. Increasingly attachment theory has replaced it, thus {{focusing on the}} quality and continuity of caregiver relationships rather than <b>economic</b> <b>well-being</b> or automatic precedence of any one party, such as the biological mother. Rutter noted that in the UK, since 1980, family courts have shifted considerably to recognize the complications of attachment relationships. Children tend to have attachment relationships with both parents and often grandparents or other relatives. Judgements need to take this into account along {{with the impact of}} step-families. Attachment theory has been crucial in highlighting the importance of social relationships in dynamic rather than fixed terms.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{signing the}} accords, Arafat—as Chairman of the PLO and its {{official}} representative—signed two letters renouncing violence and officially recognizing Israel. In return, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, {{on behalf of}} Israel, officially recognized the PLO. The following year, Arafat and Rabin were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, along with Shimon Peres. The Palestinian reaction was mixed. The Rejectionist Front of the PLO allied itself with Islamists in a common opposition against the agreements. It was rejected also by Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan {{as well as by}} many Palestinian intellectuals and the local leadership of the Palestinian territories. However, the inhabitants of the territories generally accepted the agreements and Arafat's promise for peace and <b>economic</b> <b>well-being.</b>|$|E

25|$|In turn, {{the role}} of {{government}} in the national economy had become associated with the assumption by the state of the responsibility for assuring its citizens of a degree of <b>economic</b> <b>well-being.</b> The system of economic protection for at-risk citizens sometimes called the welfare state grew out of the Great Depression, which created a popular demand for governmental intervention in the economy, and out of the theoretical contributions of the Keynesian school of economics, which asserted the need for governmental intervention to counter market imperfections.|$|E
25|$|While {{economic}} {{compensation is}} merely the result of scarcity, educational attainment {{may be related to}} that very economic principle as well. The attainment of a graduate degree represents the acquisition of expertise (a factor of production) that in itself may be scarce; thus leading to better financial compensation for the owner. As stated above, the upper middle class features a strong reliance on educational attainment (the ownership of expertise) for much of its social and <b>economic</b> <b>well-being.</b> The following chart further explains the strong correlation between educational attainment and personal as well as household income.|$|E

25|$|The title {{industry}} is {{highly dependent on}} real estate markets, which, in turn, are highly sensitive to mortgage interest rates and the overall <b>economic</b> <b>well-being.</b> During the housing bubble from 2000 through 2006, the industry's revenue more than doubled. As the surge in real estate transactions drove up title insurance revenue—along with a greater incidence of claims—the economic downturn that started in 2007 pared back revenue significantly for several years. To compare, the industry reported nearly $17billion in title insurance premiums in 2005, but volume fell to $9.6billion in 2009.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} a great {{acceleration}} in globalization; therefore it includes widening the social, cultural and political rules, norms and moderations. Different parts of the world gain these reforms for their <b>economic</b> <b>well-beings,</b> social and political structures, to solve their socio-economic problems and to promote economic activities in countries all around the world. In this respect, globalization is captured by capital flows, foreign investment, transnational enterprises, migration, and increasing mobility of labor including women. Because women are the largest growing part and they are getting a very high share from the economic globalization that necessitate skilled and educated labor. So women increase either their space in organizations or open enterprises for themselves. In this paper, it is showed clearly that globalization has both negative and positive impacts on women in Turkey, but it has more affirmative effect to find jobs they deserve in global market. Women in management at global level in Turkey proceed more compared to past years. Management; Globalization; Women; Enterprises; Women managers...|$|R

Protests at pipeline construction sites in North Dakota began in the spring of 2016 and drew indigenous people, calling themselves water protectors and land defenders, from throughout North America as well as many other supporters, creating the largest gathering of Native Americans in the past hundred years.|$|E
25|$|More {{women are}} living in poverty due {{to changes in the}} {{traditional}} family structure. The increase in divorce rates and single parenthood are two major contributing factors to change in the family structure. Female-headed families have the poorest economic outcomes, with <b>economic</b> <b>well-being</b> dependent on the mother’s marital status and race/ethnicity. White women generally have access to other income, through marriage or relationships with the highest income earners: white men. Whereas black women, in comparison to white women, are less likely to have white men as partners, and tend to have partners who earn less than white males, even when equally employed. The absence of second income-earning adults is what, in some cases,impedes the well-being of minority women and children.|$|E
