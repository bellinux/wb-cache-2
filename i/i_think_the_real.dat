They commented: [...] "First and foremost, this episode, as the title implies, is a nice spotlight on poor, overworked, underpaid Mrs. Krabappel. Krabappel's relationship with Principal Skinner takes center stage [...] But there's a ton more to this episode, including Grampa's story about serving as a four year old in World War I; Milhouse showing up with his uncle to give Bart a ride in a Blackhawk Helicopter; and a trip to a very thinly veiled parody of Disney World's EPCOT Center [...] that is filled with spot on parodies like the World of Tomorrow ride, which is a horribly dated 1960s take on the far future of the year 1984." ...|$|E

We were but a small country, with a population which, when the war began, was not much more than half that of France. And then, France had increased by leaps and bounds, reaching out to the north into Belgium and Holland, and to the south into Italy, whilst we were weakened by deep-lying disaffection among both Catholics and Presbyterians in Ireland. The danger was imminent and plain to the least thoughtful. One could not walk the Kent coast without seeing the beacons heaped up to tell the country of the enemy's landing, and if the sun were shining on the uplands near Boulogne, one might catch the flash of its gleam upon the bayonets of manoeuvring veterans. No wonder that a fear of the French power lay deeply in the hearts of the most gallant men, and that fear should, as it always does, beget a bitter and rancorous hatred.|$|E

40|$|Let me say, {{to finish}} this review, that the {{achievements}} of Field"s book are undeniable. He offers a paracomplete logic that preserves the principles and features that enable us to use the truth predicate as a logical device of quantification over sentences. His logic, moreover, validates an impressively high number of classical principles and contains an operator {{that can be used}} to characterize paradoxical sentences without at least apparently falling prey of new paradoxes. That is, doubtless, a remarkable feat and the use Field makes of fixed point constructions and revision rules, together with his discussion of well-known solutions to the Liar Paradox constitute a major contribution to the literature on this topic. If my remarks here pursue often what the book leaves out (rather than what it contains), that is, partly, because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>the</b> <b>real</b> philosophical significance of Field"s achievements will emerge in discussing some of the issues that could not be developed in STFP...|$|R
60|$|Such are the {{arguments}} that are used, both publicly and privately, in every discussion upon this point. They are generally full of passion and of error, and built upon facts which in themselves are most false. It cannot, I confess, be denied, that those miserable performances which go about under the names of Histories of Ireland do, indeed, represent those events after this manner; and they would persuade us, contrary to the known order of Nature, that indulgence and moderation in governors is the natural incitement in subjects to rebel. But there is an interior history of Ireland, the genuine voice of its records and monuments, which speaks a very different language from these histories, from Temple and from Clarendon: these restore Nature to its just rights, and policy to its proper order. For they even now show {{to those who have}} been at the pains to examine them, and they may show one day to all the world, that these rebellions were not produced by toleration, but by persecution,--that they arose not from just and mild government, but from the most unparalleled oppression. These records will be far from giving the least countenance to a doctrine so repugnant to humanity and good sense as that the security of any establishment, civil or religious, can ever depend upon the misery of those who live under it, or that its danger can arise from their quiet and prosperity. God forbid that the history of this or any country should give such encouragement to the folly or vices of those who govern! If it can be shown that the great rebellions of Ireland have arisen from attempts to reduce the natives to the state to which they are now reduced, it will show that an attempt to continue them in that state will rather be disadvantageous to the public peace than any kind of security to it. These things have in some measure begun to appear already; and as far as regards the argument drawn from former rebellions, it will fall readily to the ground. But, for my part, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> danger to every state is, to render its subjects justly discontented; nor is there in polities or science any more effectual secret for their security than to establish in their people a firm opinion that no change can be for their advantage. It is true that bigotry and fanaticism may for a time draw great multitudes of people from a knowledge of their true and substantial interest. But upon this I have to remark three things. First, that such a temper can never become universal, or last for a long time. The principle of religion is seldom lasting; the majority of men are in no persuasion bigots; they are not willing to sacrifice, on every vain imagination that superstition or enthusiasm holds forth, or that even zeal and piety recommend, the certain possession of their temporal happiness. And if such a spirit has been at any time roused in a society, after it has had its paroxysm it commonly subsides and is quiet, and is even the weaker for the violence of its first exertion: security and ease are its mortal enemies. But, secondly, if anything can tend to revive and keep it up, it is to keep alive the passions of men by ill usage. This is enough to irritate even those who have not a spark of bigotry in their constitution to the most desperate enterprises; it certainly will inflame, darken, and render more dangerous the spirit of bigotry in those who are possessed by it. Lastly, by rooting out any sect, you are never secure against the effects of fanaticism; it may arise {{on the side of the}} most favored opinions; and many are the instances wherein the established religion of a state has grown ferocious and turned upon its keeper, and has often torn to pieces the civil establishment that had cherished it, and which it was designed to support: France,--England,--Holland.|$|E

6000|$|And since a {{large portion}} of our {{knowledge}} is thus acquired, logicians have persisted in representing the syllogism as a process of inference or proof; though none of them has cleared up the difficulty which arises from the inconsistency between that assertion, and the principle, that if there be any thing in the conclusion which was not already asserted in the premises, the argument is vicious. For it is impossible to attach any serious scientific value to such a mere salvo, as the distinction drawn between being involved by implication in the premises, and being directly asserted in them. When Archbishop Whately says(56) that the object of reasoning is “merely to expand and unfold the assertions wrapped up, as it were, and implied in those with which we set out, and to bring a person to perceive and acknowledge the full force of that which he has admitted,” he does not, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> meet <b>the</b> <b>real</b> difficulty requiring to be explained, namely, how it happens that a science, like geometry, can be all “wrapped up” in a few definitions and axioms. Nor does this defense of the syllogism differ much from what its assailants urge against it as an accusation, when they charge it with being of no use except to those who seek to press the consequences of an admission into which a person has been entrapped without having considered and understood its full force. When you admitted the major premise, you asserted the conclusion; but, says Archbishop Whately, you asserted it by implication merely: this, however, can here only mean that you asserted it unconsciously; that you did not know you were asserting it; but, if so, the difficulty revives in this shape—Ought you not to have known? Were you warranted in asserting the general proposition without having satisfied yourself of the truth of every thing which it fairly includes? And if not, is not the syllogistic art prima facie what its assailants affirm it to be, a contrivance for catching you in a trap, and holding you fast in it?(57) ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{relationship}} between Orthodoxy and feminism {{is more complicated}} than women to run to minyan three times a day on time - acting like men, if you will. As I’ve said many times, there is a whole slew of reasons why women do not come “on time” or perhaps at all - whether it’s that they are still doing the bulk of childcare and food preparation on Shabbat, whether they are still recovering from years of alienation and a private resistance that makes reading the paper on Shabbat morning very attractive, or whether they have internalized the message that if they don’t count for minyan, it doesn’t really matter if they come anyway. But more than that, the assumption that feminist resistance entails women acting like men is misguided.For one thing, everything that men are expected to do as “Orthodox” - whether being “on time” three times a day or standing without talking from beginning to end of the service - assumes female servitude. The only reason men have been able to insist on “on time” and fulfilling all their other rigid, ritualistic obligations is because they have always been able to count on women to cook, clean and watch the kids. These assumptions persist today - not only in Orthodoxy. It is not uncommon for men to plan business trips without regard to home needs, they continue to work the longest hours they can knowing that someone at home is picking up the slack, and as such they continue to buy into notions that they should be praying in a group of ten men three times a day despite the strain these assumptions place on female labor. To wit: Nachum’s entire model for Orthodox masculinity is the “yeshiva bachur,” the single student whose every need is taken care of by - whom? The community? The mother? The wife? It doesn’t matter. There continues to be an idealization of religious practice that is fully dependent on the servitude of someone else, usually women. So if women want access to this, they have a problem. Who is serving their needs so they can freely and happily get to shul?More than that, there is a more profound point: I submit that women find the standard male practice absent of meaning. Female cultures of spirituality are emotion-filled, personal, engaging, musical, spontaneous, surrounded by people, connections, children, and friendships. Jews have been praying {{more or less the same}} way from a certain book with the same pages upon pages of words for recitation for, oh, a few thousand years give or take. So when push comes to shove and women gain access to those practices, the celebration is short lived. For this we struggled so hard? This is what we were looking for all this time? No wonder so many women say, okay, but no thanks. Women seeking access to this space from which they are systematically excluded are disappointed with their own culture. Because it is not really their culture - it is men’s culture. The Orthodox synagogue, even when women are involved, remains a men’s space based on men’s culture.Ultimately, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>the</b> <b>real</b> reason why women are not running to synagogue is found in the core of this research. If we look at Orthodox masculinity, and compare it to Orthodox femininity (leaving aside for the moment the issue of hierarchy between them and the exercise of power from one to the other), on the level of a simple collection of characteristics that we will call “male” and characteristics that we will call “female”, it becomes clear why women are not rushing into the male world. Women are socialized as carers, a role which undoubtedly entails servitude, physical restrictions, and enormous amounts of unpaid labor, but also involves love, warmth, friendship, relationship, care, flexibility, and home. Men, by contrast, are socialized as mechanistic performers, with all the accompanying status, power, strength, and freedom for sure, but the construct is emotionless, connection-less, cold, and demanding, and leaves little room for individual expression or even ambivalence. In fact, to be a man may provide personal power, and it certainly has physical, social and monetary rewards, but it does not necessarily involve freedom. Being mounted with expectations of three times a day rote repetition and performance among emotionless peers - and calling that prayer, as if it is actually a spiritual expression - is not all that attractive. It is especially not attractive to women who have experienced something else. Women who have experienced friendship, sharing, deep caring and the love between women look at what goes on between men and <b>think,</b> why would <b>I</b> want to become that? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that’s <b>the</b> <b>real</b> reason women aren’t all that interested in running to do the man’s thing in synagogue.

60|$|No, I didn't {{like those}} young countrymen, and I'm no {{believer in the}} English {{countryside}} under the Bladesover system as {{a breeding ground for}} honourable men. One hears a frightful lot of nonsense about the Rural Exodus and the degeneration wrought by town life upon our population. To my mind, the English townsman, even in the slums, is infinitely better spiritually, more courageous, more imaginative and cleaner, than his agricultural cousin. I've seen them both when they didn't think they were being observed, and I know. There was something about my Wimblehurst companions that disgusted me. It's hard to define. Heaven knows that at that cockney boarding-school at Goudhurst we were coarse enough; the Wimblehurst youngsters had neither words nor courage for the sort of thing we used to do--for our bad language, for example; but, on the other hand, they displayed a sort of sluggish, real lewdness, lewdness is the word--a baseness of attitude. Whatever we exiled urbans did at Goudhurst was touched with something, however coarse, of romantic imagination. We had read the Boys of England, and told each other stories. In the English countryside there are no books at all, no songs, no drama, no valiant sin even; all these things have never come or they were taken away and hidden generations ago, and the imagination aborts and bestialises. That, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> is where <b>the</b> <b>real</b> difference against <b>the</b> English rural man lies. It is because I know this that I do not share in the common repinings because our countryside is being depopulated, because our population is passing through the furnace of the towns. They starve, they suffer, no doubt, but they come out of it hardened, they come out of it with souls.|$|R
