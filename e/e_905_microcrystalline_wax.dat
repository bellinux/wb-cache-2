It is also permitted as a surface treatment of melons, papaya, mango and avocado. The substance was evaluated by the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) in 1990 and 1995 and by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), the latest in 1995. The JECFA established a group ADI of 20 mg/kg bw/day for mineral oils, paraffins and <b>microcrystalline</b> <b>waxes.</b> The Panel noted that all mineral oil products accumulated in tissues in a dose- and time-dependent manner {{with the exception of}} <b>microcrystalline</b> <b>waxes.</b> The Panel concluded that there is no concern for genotoxicity from <b>microcrystalline</b> <b>wax</b> (<b>E</b> <b>905).</b> The Panel also considered that the available toxicity studies with mineral hydrocarbons, closely related from a chemical point of view with <b>microcrystalline</b> <b>waxes,</b> consistently reported no effects of concern associated with the intake of <b>microcrystalline</b> <b>wax.</b> The Panel further concluded that since no long-term toxicity and carcinogenicity studies with <b>microcrystalline</b> <b>wax</b> <b>E</b> <b>905</b> were available, no ADI could be established. The Panel also concluded that the conservative exposure estimates to <b>microcrystalline</b> <b>wax</b> (<b>E</b> <b>905)</b> from its use at maximum permitted level (following quantum satis rules), resulted in a sufficient margin of safety compared to the NOAEL established by the Panel for the closely related high viscosity mineral oils, and therefore the use <b>microcrystalline</b> <b>wax</b> (<b>E</b> <b>905)</b> as a food additive with the currently authorised uses would not be of safety concern...|$|R
50|$|<b>Microcrystalline</b> <b>waxes</b> are {{a type of}} wax {{produced}} by de-oiling petrolatum, {{as part of the}} petroleum refining process. In contrast to the more familiar paraffin wax which contains mostly unbranched alkanes, <b>microcrystalline</b> <b>wax</b> contains a higher percentage of isoparaffinic (branched) hydrocarbons and naphthenic hydrocarbons. It is characterized by the fineness of its crystals in contrast to the larger crystal of paraffin wax. It consists of high molecular weight saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons. It is generally darker, more viscous, denser, tackier and more elastic than paraffin waxes, and has a higher molecular weight and melting point. The elastic and adhesive characteristics of <b>microcrystalline</b> <b>waxes</b> are related to the non-straight chain components which they contain. Typical <b>microcrystalline</b> <b>wax</b> crystal structure is small and thin, making them more flexible than paraffin wax. It is commonly used in cosmetic formulations.|$|R

Commission Regulation No 231 / 2012 established physical and chemical specifications for <b>microcrystalline</b> <b>waxes</b> to use in food, and posed a limit of 50 μg/kg for benzo(a) pyrene.

The official method for indirect determination of total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons uses unspecific spectrophotometric detection and a quite laborious, time- and solvent-consuming extraction method. A liquid-liquid partition method followed by solid-phase microextraction was developed to isolate benzo(a) pyrene from the bulk of saturated hydrocarbons in <b>microcrystalline</b> <b>waxes,</b> with the aim to have a simple and effective method to verify compliance with the legal limit.

30|$|Waxes and {{asphaltenes}} are {{the most}} important constituents of crude oils because they have a great influence on crude oil properties. Waxes are a complex mixture of solid (at ambient temperature) hydrocarbons which consist mainly of paraffin hydrocarbons {{with a small amount of}} naphthenic and aromatic hydrocarbons as well as polar compounds. There are two general classes of petroleum waxes. Waxes that are composed primarily of normal alkanes (n-alkanes) with a chain length of C 18 –C 30 and crystallize in large flat plates (macrocrystalline structures) with a melting point of 40 – 60  °C are referred to as paraffin waxes (Jowett 1984). Waxes, which consist primarily of the higher molecular weight n-alkanes within C 30 –C 60, with a high share of iso-paraffins and naphthenes, and have much higher melting point ranges (above 60 – 90  °C), are referred to as <b>microcrystalline</b> <b>waxes.</b> According to Musser and Kilpatrick (1998), paraffinic and <b>microcrystalline</b> <b>waxes</b> have molecular weight ranges of 350 – 600 and 300 – 2500, respectively.|$|R
