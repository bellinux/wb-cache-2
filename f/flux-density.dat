The model is based on a flux-tubes of varying radius that are highly structured, translationally invariant, and axisymmetric. The absorbed fractional energy is determined for different <b>flux-densities</b> and subphotospheric locations with attention given to the effects of twist. When the flux is highly concentrated into annuli efficient absorption is possible even when the mean magnetic flux density is low. The model demonstrates low absorption at low azimuthal orders even in the presence of twist which generally increases the range of wave numbers over which efficient absorption can occur. Resonance absorption is concluded to be an efficient mechanism in monolithic sunspots, fibril sunspots, and plage fields...|$|R

We study the possible periodicity of B 0605 - 085 in the total <b>flux-density,</b> spectra and opacity changes in order to compare it with jet kinematics on parsec scales. We have analyzed archival total <b>flux-density</b> variability at ten frequencies (408 MHz, 4. 8 GHz, 6. 7 GHz, 8 GHz, 10. 7 GHz, 14. 5 GHz, 22 GHz, 37 GHz, 90 GHz, and 230 GHz) together with the archival high-resolution very long baseline interferometry data at 15 GHz from the MOJAVE monitoring campaign. Using the Fourier transform and discrete autocorrelation methods we have searched for periods in the total <b>flux-density</b> light curves. In addition, spectral evolution and changes of the opacity have been analyzed. We found a period in multi-frequency total <b>flux-density</b> light curves of 7. 9 +- 0. 5 yrs. Moreover, a quasi-stationary jet component C 1 follows a prominent helical path on a similar time scale of 8 years. We have {{also found that the}} average instantaneous speeds of the jet components show a clear helical pattern along the jet with a characteristic scale of 3 mas. Taking into account average speeds of jet components, this scale corresponds to a time scale of about 7. 7 years. Jet precession can explain the helical path of the quasi-stationary jet component C 1 and the periodical modulation of the total <b>flux-density</b> light curves.

40|$|We {{present the}} results from recent VLA 8. 5 –GHz and WSRT 1. 4 and 4. 9 –GHz {{monitoring}} campaigns of the CLASS gravitational lens B 1600 + 434 and show how the observed variations argue strongly in favor of microlensing by MACHOs in the halo of a dark–matter dominated edge–on disk galaxy at z= 0. 4. The population of flat–spectrum radio sources with micro–Jy <b>flux–densities</b> detected with the Square–Kilometer–Array {{is expected to have}} dimensions of micro–arcsec. They will therefore vary rapidly as a result of Galactic scintillation (diffractive and refractive). However, when positioned behind distant galaxies they will also show variations due to microlensing, even more strongly than in the case of B 1600 + 434. Relativistic or superluminal motion in these background sources typically leads to temporal variations on time scales of days to weeks. Scintillation and microlensing can be distinguished, and separated, by their different characteristic time scales and the frequency dependence of their modulations. Monitoring studies with Square–Kilometer–Array at GHz frequencies will thus probe both microscopic and macroscopic properties of dark matter and its mass–function as a function of redshift, information very hard to obtain by any other method. ...|$|R

The low–frequency (151 MHz) selected 7 CRS sample contains all sources with <b>flux-densities</b> S 151 > 0. 5 Jy in three regions of the sky; 7 C–I and 7 C–II were chosen to overlap with the 5 C 6 and 5 C 7 surveys respectively, and cover a total sky area of 0. 013 sr.

40|$|We discuss {{about how}} the {{relative}} flux densities among the images of gravitationally-lensed active galactic nuclei (AGN), {{can be used to}} study the intrinsic AGN variability with high accuracy. Multi-frequency monitoring observations of resolved gravitational lenses can allow us to detect signals of very weak variability and also provide information about the jet opacity and structure. As an example, we investigate the variability of the <b>flux-density</b> ratio between the two lensed images of the blazar B 0218 + 357, using dual-frequency cm-wave observations. Similar to our previously reported submm-wave observations of the lensed blazar PKS 1830 - 211, we observe a clear chromatic variability, starting short before an increase in the <b>flux-density</b> of the blazar. The evolution of the <b>flux-density</b> ratios between the blazar images shows a more clear and rich structure than that of the mere lightcurves of each individual image. The accuracy in the ratio measurements is allowing us to see variability episodes in the blazar that are weaker than the natural scatter in the absolute <b>flux-density</b> measurements. A simple opacity model in the jet is used to consistently explain the difference between the flux-density-ratio evolution at the two frequencies...|$|E

40|$|Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and star-forming {{galaxies are}} well-traced {{in the radio}} part of the {{electromagnetic}} spectrum, due to emission at these wavelengths being unaffected by dust obscuration. The key processes involved in producing the radio emission are black-hole accretion and star formation, {{both of which are}} thought to be crucial in determining how galaxies evolve. Disentangling the two contributions requires multi-wavelength data, and this is the approach we use for our work on radio-quiet quasars (RQQs). In contrast to previous studies, we find that accretion-connected radio emission dominates over that due to star formation, even at very low radio <b>flux-densities.</b> The first sample we describe is selected from the VISTA Deep Extragalactic Observations (VIDEO) survey, whose depth allows the study of very low accretion rates and/or lower-mass black holes. A second sample is obtained from the Spitzer-Herschel Active Galaxy Survey, spanning a factor of ~ 100 in optical luminosity over a narrow redshift range at z ~ 1. This enables evolutionary effects to be decoupled when comparisons are made with the VIDEO sample. Using radio data from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA), we find further support that the AGN makes a significant contribution to the radio emission in RQQs.

40|$|We {{describe}} a technique for simultaneously classifying and estimating the redshift of quasars. It can separate quasars from stars in arbitrary redshift ranges, estimate full posterior distribution functions for the redshift, and naturally incorporate flux uncertainties, missing data, and multi-wavelength photometry. We build models of quasars in flux-redshift space {{by applying the}} extreme deconvolution technique to estimate the underlying density. By integrating this density over redshift one can obtain quasar <b>flux-densities</b> in different redshift ranges. This approach allows for efficient, consistent, and fast classification and photometric redshift estimation. This is achieved by combining the speed obtained by choosing simple analytical forms {{as the basis of}} our density model with the flexibility of non-parametric models through the use of many simple components with many parameters. We show that this technique is competitive with the best photometric quasar classification techniques [...] -which are limited to fixed, broad redshift ranges and high signal-to-noise ratio data [...] -and with the best photometric redshift techniques when applied to broadband optical data. We demonstrate that the inclusion of UV and NIR data significantly improves photometric quasar [...] star separation and essentially resolves all of the redshift degeneracies for quasars inherent to the ugriz filter system, even when included data have a low signal-to-noise ratio. For quasars spectroscopically confirmed by the SDSS 84 and 97 percent of the objects with GALEX UV and UKIDSS NIR data have photometric redshifts within 0. 1 and 0. 3, respectively, of the spectroscopic redshift; this amounts to about a factor of three improvement over ugriz-only photometric redshifts.

40|$|We present K-band imaging of all 49 radio {{galaxies in}} the 7 C–I and 7 C–II regions of the 7 C Redshift Survey (7 CRS). The low–frequency (151 MHz) {{selected}} 7 CRS sample contains all sources with <b>flux-densities</b> S 151 > 0. 5 Jy in three regions of the sky. We combine the K-band magnitudes of the 7 CRS radio galaxies with those from the 3 CRR, 6 CE and 6 C ⋆ samples to investigate {{the nature of the}} relationship between K-magnitude and redshift and whether there is any dependence upon radio luminosity. We find that radio galaxies appear to belong to a homogeneous population which formed the bulk of their stars at high redshifts (zf> 5) and evolved passively from then until they reach a mean present-day luminosity of 3 L⋆. We find a significant difference between the K-magnitudes of the 7 CRS and 3 CRR radio galaxies with the 7 CRS galaxies being ≈ 0. 55 mag fainter at all redshifts. The cause of this weak correlation between stellar and radio luminosities probably lies in mutual correlations of these properties with the central black hole mass. We compare the evolution-corrected host luminosities at a constant radio luminosity and find that the typical host luminosity (mass) increases by approximately 1 L ⋆ from z ∼ 2 to z ∼ 0. 5 which, although a much smaller factor than predicted by semi-analytic models of galaxy formation, is in line with results on optically-selected quasars. Our study has therefore revealed that the small dispersion in stellar luminosity of radio galaxies around 3 L ⋆ includes subtle but significant differences between the host galaxies of extreme- and moderate-power radio sources at fixed redshift, and between those of high- and low-redshift radio sources at fixed radio luminosity...|$|R

At FOM Rijnhuizen, linear plasma generators are used to investigate plasma-material interactions under high hydrogen ion <b>flux-densities</b> up to 10 (25) m(- 2) s(- 1) at low electron temperatures (&lt;= 10 eV), similar to the conditions expected in the divertor of ITER.

In the simulation, the change in sand topographic features corresponds well to the <b>flux–density</b> diagram. Sand topographic features shift at the fluxes of the boundaries between segments of the curve in the diagram (Fig.  5), which suggests that sand sheets, sand patches, and sand ripples correspond to the traffic phases of free flow, congested, and jam, respectively, depending on the degree of interference between sand particles.|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} more than 8 -yr {{monitoring}} (1988 - 1997) of the Wolf-Rayet binary WR 147 (WN 8 (h) -OB) with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) are presented. When the strong winds of the Wolf-Rayet (WR) and OB binary components collide. they produce non-thermal excess radiation in the region where the two winds interact. The binary system, monitored at 1. 4 and 5 GHz (21 and 6 cm), is not resolved by the WSRT, thus we observed the total flux density of the system. The time-averaged 5 and 1. 4 -GHz flux densities are 35. 4 +/- 0. 4 mJy and 26. 4 +/- 0. 3 mJy, respectively These give a time-averaged spectral index of alpha (5 - 1. 4 GHz) approximate to 0. 23 +/- 0. 04, where S-nu proportional to nu (alpha). The departure from the value expected for thermal radiation from a spherically symmetric stellar wind, alpha = 0. 6, call be attributed to non-thermal emission from a bow-shaped source {{to the north of}} the thermal source associated with the WN 8 star. With a possible detection at 350 WHz of 16 +/- mJy, in our separate study of the Cygnus region, the spectral energy distribution, after the contribution of the southern thermal source is subtracted, can be fitted by a synchrotron emission model which includes free-free absorption. The nonthermal emission originates in the region where the winds of the binary components collide. This region, therefore, contains a mixture of relativistic particles accelerated by shocks and thermal particles, responsible for the free-free absorption. We show, in a simplified model of the system, that additional free-free absorption may occur when the line of sight to the collision region passes through the radiophotosphere of the WR wind. The 1. 4 -GHz flux density of WR 147 varied between similar to 20 mJy and similar to 30 mJy. We attribute the irregular, stochastic variations with a typical timescale of about 60 days to inhomogeneities in the wind, with different mechanisms involved in the <b>flux-density</b> increase than in the <b>flux-density</b> decrease. A <b>flux-density</b> increase results when the inhomogeneities in the wind/clumps enter the wind collision region, fuelling the synchrotron emission. The typical timescale of the <b>flux-density</b> decrease is shorter than the timescale of synchrotron loss (similar to 10 (3) yr) or the Inverse-Compton lifetime (approximate to 4. 5 yr), but of the order of the Row time in the colliding-wind region (similar to 80 d). Therefore, we suggest that the <b>flux-density</b> decrease is due to plasma outflow from the system. Furthermore. variable free-free absorption due to large clumps passing the line of sight may also cause variations in the flux density. We observe a possible long-term <b>flux-density</b> variation oil top of the stochastic variation. This variation is fitted with a sinusoid with a similar to 7. 9 -yr period, with a reduced chi (2) of 1. 9. However. as the period of the sinusoid is too close to the monitoring time span, further monitoring is needed to confirm this lon-term variation...|$|E

This thesis plays a supporting role in the ongoing commissioning activities of the KAT- 7, whose construction started in early 2008, and which has been undergoing engineering and science verifications since late 2010. This thesis has achieved the first steps towards identifying possible <b>flux-density</b> standards for short baseline interferometers such as the KAT- 7. The systematic error for <b>flux-density</b> calibration at KAT- 7 was estimated relative to 3 C 123, and it {{was found to be}} ~ 5 % of the measured flux density. 18 (~ 47 %) of the 38 sources were identified as good flux density calibrator candidates, for their Modulation Index (MI) and Variability Index (VI) values were less than 0. 05 and all the sources in the field had less than 10 % of the peak flux density of the calibrator candidate. One source (PKS J 0837 - 1951), which showed low variability and hence appeared to be a good <b>flux-density</b> calibrator candidate (class A), was deemed to be not a good <b>flux-density</b> calibrator candidate because a strong confusing source was found within its primary beam. Eight sources had MI or VI values between 0. 05 and 0. 09 and may deserve further study as potential flux calibrator candidates. Five sources had MI or VI values greater than 0. 09 suggesting significant variability while 17 sources had only one or two observations so their suitability as potential flux calibrator candidates could not be evaluated. In addition, we used another measure of variability, the de-biased modulation index, for our sources comparing the observed modulation indices against Monte Carlo simulations.

40|$|We {{present an}} exact {{analytical}} approach for arbitrary field-dependent critical state of high-Tc superconducting strip with transport current. The sheet current and <b>flux-density</b> profiles are derived by solving the integral equations, which agree with experiments quite well. For small transport current, the approximate explicit expressions of sheet current, <b>flux-density</b> and penetration depth for the Kim model are derived {{based on the}} mean value theorem for integration. We also extend the results to the field-dependent critical state of superconducting strip in the simultaneous presence of applied field and transport current. The sheet current distributions calculated by the Kim model agree with experiments better than that by the Bean model. Moreover, the lines in the Ia-Ba plane for the Kim model are not monotonic, which {{is quite different from}} that the Bean model. The results reveal that the maximum transport current in thin superconducting strip will decrease with increasing applied field which vanishes for the Bean model. The results of this paper are useful to calculate ac susceptibility and ac loss...|$|E
30|$|A <b>flux–density</b> diagram {{is used to}} {{show the}} dynamic {{properties}} of car traffic flows. Because the average sand thickness {{in the present study}} is equivalent to the density of particles (the number of particles per unit area), Fig.  5 can be compared to a <b>flux–density</b> diagram of traffic flow. Despite the different research targets, the two models have common points. In both models, the probability of migration of particles corresponds to the velocity. The SOV model reproduces the relation between the flux and the density of particles, and it is asymmetric (fast increase and long-tailed decrease). This agrees with observations of a real highway (Sugiyama et al. 2008) and resembles {{the results of the present}} model (Fig.  5), although car traffic jams always propagate upstream. Interestingly, the curve in Fig.  5 shows an abrupt decrease around the peak before a tail. A similar abrupt decrease is seen in observations of real traffic and is interpreted as an overshoot of the free phase against the jam phase, showing a metastability bifurcation (Kanai et al. 2005).|$|E
40|$|We {{have carried}} out {{a survey of the}} {{northern}} sky for millisecond pulsars using the Green Bank 140 ft telescope at 370 MHz. Our primary goal was to find the strongest millisecond pulsars in the northern hemisphere. A secondary goal was to study empirically the repeatability of pulsar surveys with well-understood <b>flux-density</b> limits. The <b>flux-density</b> limit of our survey was 8 mJy for slow pulsars with typical pulse shapes and high Galactic latitudes. Spectra were sampled at intervals of 256 s, so pulsars with periods as short as 512 s were potentially detectable. We obtained high quality data covering 15, 900 deg 2 of sky, or 77 % of the northern hemisphere. We observed a further 1500 deg 2 with somewhat reduced sensitivity. We detected a total of 84 pulsars, including eight not previously known. The new objects include two recycled pulsars: PSR J 1022 + 1001, a 16. 5 ms pulsar in a nearly circular 7. 8 d orbit with a white dwarf companion, and PSR J 1518 + 4904, a 40. 9 ms pulsar in a [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Time-averaged <b>flux-density</b> {{spectra of}} ten pulsars have been {{obtained}} {{on the basis of}} simultaneous observations at six frequencies between 250 and 8085 MHz. The effects of interstellar scintillation on the accuracy of the measurements are discussed. All of the pulsars exhibited a power-law spectrum at high frequencies with spectral indices between negative 1. 6 and negative 3. 0. Several of the pulsars show a more positive spectral index at the low-frequency end of the data...|$|E
40|$|We present new low-frequency {{observations}} of the nearby radio galaxy Fornax A at 154 [*]MHz with the Murchison Widefield Array, microwave <b>flux-density</b> measurements obtained from WMAP and Planck data, and γ-ray flux densities obtained from Fermi data. We also compile a comprehensive list of previously published images and <b>flux-density</b> measurements at radio, microwave and X-ray energies. A {{detailed analysis of the}} spectrum of Fornax A between 154 and 1510 [*]MHz reveals that both radio lobes have a similar spatially averaged spectral index, and that there exists a steep-spectrum bridge of diffuse emission between the lobes. Taking the spectral index of both lobes to be the same, we model the spectral energy distribution of Fornax A across an energy range spanning 18 orders of magnitude, to investigate the origin of the X-ray and γ-ray emission. A standard leptonic model for the production of both the X-rays and γ-rays by inverse-Compton scattering does not fit the multiwavelength observations. Our results best support a scenario where the X-rays are produced by inverse-Compton scattering and the γ-rays are produced primarily by hadronic processes confined to the filamentary structures of the Fornax A lobes...|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} a special class of random matrices (DUE) whose spectral statistics corresponds to statistics of microscopical quantities detected in vehicular flows. Comparing the level spacing distribution (for ordered eigenvalues in unfolded spectra of DUE matrices) with the time-clearance distribution extracted from various {{areas of the}} <b>flux-density</b> diagram (evaluated from original traffic data measured on Czech expressways with high occupancies) we demonstrate that the set of classical systems showing an universality associated with Random Matrix Ensembles can be extended by traffic systems.
