25|$|The {{brushless}} wound-rotor synchronous doubly-fed (BWRSDF) {{machine is}} the only electric machine with a truly <b>dual</b> <b>ported</b> transformer circuit topology (i.e., both ports independently excited with no short-circuited <b>port).</b> The <b>dual</b> <b>ported</b> transformer circuit topology {{is known to be}} unstable and requires a multiphase slip-ring-brush assembly to propagate limited power to the rotor winding set. If a precision means were available to instantaneously control torque angle and slip for synchronous operation during motoring or generating while simultaneously providing brushless power to the rotor winding set, the active current of the BWRSDF machine would be independent of the reactive impedance of the transformer circuit and bursts of torque significantly higher than the maximum operating torque and far beyond the practical capability of any other type of electric machine would be realizable. Torque bursts greater than eight times operating torque have been calculated.|$|R

5000|$|Also to {{be noted}} {{is the way}} in which boost control is achieved, {{depending}} on the type of wastegate used. Typically manual [...] "bleed type" [...] boost controllers are only used on swing type (single port) wastegate actuators. To increase boost, pressure is taken away from the actuator control line, therefore increasing boost. <b>Dual</b> <b>port</b> swing type wastegate actuators and external wastegates generally require electronic boost control although adjustable boost control can also be achieved on both of these with an air pressure regulator, this is not the same as a bleed type boost controller. To increase boost with an external or <b>dual</b> <b>port</b> wastegate, pressure is added to the top control port to increase boost. When boost control is not fitted, this control port is open to the atmosphere.|$|E
