40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} performance characteristics of a system designed to interface between a PCI Express port and an optical packet switched network {{as well as provide}} <b>inline</b> <b>test</b> capability for the whole system. A single lane of PCI Express traffic is inverse multiplexed across eight parallel channels and retransmitted in a burst packet at aggregate data rates of 20 to 36 Gbps. Testing options include loopback self-test, data synthesis and substitution in-line with or in place of system data, and variable channel-to-channel skew. The I/O interfaces also support a range of variable analog parameters such as peak output amplitude, output amplitude swing, and common mode ranges for the input and output to evaluate the performance of or adapt to changes in the opto-electronic components. This design flexibility also allows for use of the system in more conventional electronic applications with little or no required modifications. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Process-induced {{variability}} {{has become}} a predominant limiter of performance and yield of IC products especially in a deep submicron technology. However, {{it is difficult to}} accurately model systematic process variability due to the complicated and interrelated nature of physical mechanisms of variation. In this paper, a simple and practical method is presented to decompose process variability using statistics of the measurements from manufacturing <b>inline</b> <b>test</b> structures without assuming any underlying model for process variation. The decomposition method utilizes a variant of principal component analysis and is able to reveal systematic variation signatures existing on a die-to-die and wafer-to-wafer scale individually. Experimental results show that the most dominant die-to-die variation and wafer-to-wafer variation represent 31 % and 25 % of the total variance of a large set of manufacturing inline parameters in 65 -nm SOI CMOS technology. The process variation in RF circuit performance is also analyzed and shown to contain 66 % of process variation obtained with manufacturing inline parameters.

40|$|Collar forming is a {{tractive}} compressive forming {{technique to}} turn up a closed component border, often a circular hole in a sheet metal or sheet metal component. Today, high-strength steel materials with a reduced deformation capability compared to a smoother deep drawing grade are used increasingly in collar forming due to developments in lightweight body production. This is {{at the expense of}} the constructive claim for preferably high collar heights. In many applications collar shapes requiring an expansion close to the maximum expansion possibility of the sheet metal component are produced. Negative influences on material ductility caused by batch deviations and further process deviations while handling the components can cause undesirable and irregularly appearing cracking during the collar forming process. Visual supervision by the staff at the outfeed conveyor is a limited possibility depending on the cracking type and size and further circumstances in the processing environment. If crack-containing components are not identified and sorted out early in the process chain, they can be joined to the shell or even be delivered to the customer in the corresponding assembly. The project's objective was to develop and validate a non-destructive test method to detect cracks in collar forming respectively components containing a collar automatically. The suitability of the considered test methods has been evaluated in terms of this application. Non-destructive post-process methods and an in-process method were used. Besides inductive thermal imaging, eddy current testing and electromagnetic ultrasound, noise emission analysis has been performed. Laboratory samples containing a collar of high-strength steel materials and an aluminium alloy have been consulted as objects of investigation. Samples with a wide range of both natural and artificial cracks were used to validate the test methods. Parts from serial processes have also been included. Two test concepts based on the investigations realized were created with regards to the process accompanying and integrated application of crack detection. The first concept uses an EMUS test system whose sensory components can be integrated into the transfer press' space. In the simple case, the EMUS test can be integrated into the transfer press as an own test step at the end of the process chain. The integration of the EMUS sensors directly to the collar forming tool is basically possible. In every case the sensors have to be tailored to the height and diameter of the collar geometry. The collar geometry testable with EMUS brings specific requirements. In the second test concept based on inductive thermal imaging any collar geometry can be tested if optically accessible. The necessary demand of space for mounting such a test system is significantly higher than with EMUS. Therefore this test concept cannot be integrated into the transfer press or even into the tool. The thermal imaging test system can be installed at the conveyor as a continuous <b>inline</b> <b>test</b> method. The objective of the project was achieved...|$|E
40|$|Measuring {{security}} controls across {{multiple layers of}} defense requires realistic data sets and repeatable experiments. However, data sets that are collected from real users often cannot be freely exchanged due to privacy and regulatory concerns. Synthetic datasets, which can be shared, {{have in the past}} had critical flaws or at best been one time collections of data focusing on a single layer or type of data. We present a framework for generating synthetic datasets with normal and attack data for web applications across multiple layers simultaneously. The framework is modular and designed for data to be easily recreated in order to vary parameters and allow for <b>inline</b> <b>testing.</b> We build a prototype data generator using the framework to generate nine datasets with data logged on four layers: network, file accesses, system calls, and database simultaneously. We then test nineteen {{security controls}} spanning all four layers to determine their sensitivity to dataset changes, compare performance even across layers, compare synthetic data to real production data, and calculate combined defense in depth performance of sets of controls...|$|R
40|$|The {{capabilities}} of three on-load and one off-load release mechanisms were investigated for normal, extreme and failure type release {{operations at the}} Institute for Ocean Technology. The failure of release mechanisms during maintenance and exercise drills is a well-documented occurrence. However, until very recently the possible causes of the failures have only been postulated but never tested in a systematic way. The current study aims for {{a better understanding of}} the operational performance of lifeboat release mechanisms with respect to normal, extreme and failure operational situations. Three twin fall davit on-load release mechanisms and one off-load release mechanism were tested in the experimental study. All the release mechanism design types are fully certified by the regulatory bodies. Of the three on-load release mechanisms, two were of older existing design types while the third was of a newer (next generation) design. Of the four release mechanisms tested, two of the mechanisms were new and never used outside of this study. Also, one of the never used new mechanisms was of an older design while the other was the next generation design. The never used mechanisms had a loading capacity of 6 tonnes, while the third on-load release mechanism had been in operation for some time and had a capacity of 3 tonnes. The off-load mechanism had also been in use and had a capacity of 12 tonnes. The experiments were conducted in the material testing facility of the Institute for Ocean Technology of the National Research Council of Canada and encompassed the following tests: Inline/offline on-load tests Inline/offline static tests Offline cyclic loading Offline damage release cable <b>Inline</b> off-load <b>tests</b> Results for the above mentioned tests will be presented in this report. Thus far all the results from in-line to offline, and from dynamic to static indicate that hook C, the next generation design, appears to have a higher degree of stability than the other two sample hooks. The off-load release mechanism was limited to <b>inline</b> <b>tests</b> and followed a different testing procedure as the on-load mechanisms. The off-load release mechanism worked as intended in the limited test conditions. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

40|$|Besides the {{aerospace}} industry, fibre reinforced plastics have also spread towards many further {{applications such as}} automotive, civil engineering as well as sports and leisure articles. Their superior strength and stiffness to mass ratio made them the number one material for achieving high performance. Especially continuous fibre reinforced plastics allow {{for the construction of}} structures which are custom tailored to their mechanical loads by adjusting the paths of the fibres to the loading direction. The two main constituents of CFRP are carbon fibres and matrix. Two possibilities for matrix material exist: thermosetting and thermoplastic matrix. While thermosetting matrix may yield better properties with respect to thermal loads, thermoplasticity opens a wide range of applications due to weldability, shapabilty, and compatibility to e. g. injection moulded thermoplastic materials. Thin (0. 18 mm) thermoplastic continuous fibre CFRP tapes with a width of 100 mm were examined using air-coupled ultrasound. Transducers were arranged in reflection as well as transmission setup. By slanted incidence of the ultrasound on the tape surface, guided waves were excited in the material in fibre direction and perpendicular to the fibre direction. Artificial defects – fibre cuts, matrix cuts, circular holes, low velocity impacts from tool drop, and sharp bends – were produced. Experiments on a stationary tape showed good detectability of all artificial defects by guided waves. Also the effects of variation in material properties, fibre volume content and fibre matrix adhesion being the most relevant, on guided wave propagation were examined, to allow for quality assessment. Guided wave measurements were supported by destructive analysis. Also an apparatus containing one endless loop of CFRP tape was constructed and built to simulate <b>inline</b> <b>testing</b> of CFRP tapes, as it would be employed in a CFRP tape production environment or at a CFRP tape processing facility. The influences of tape conveying speed on detectability of artificial defects as well as material properties were elaborated and recommendations for implementation in production scale inline monitoring are given...|$|R
40|$|Non-destructive testing (NDT) of fibre {{reinforced}} plastics (FRP) {{is a challenge}} due to their complex inner structures. Different NDT technologies like ultrasound, thermography or computer tomography (CT) are currently used for the inspection of FRP. Each of these testing methods has its pros and cons. CT offers detailed 3 D information about the inner structures of the materials, but is quite time-consuming. Ultrasound and thermography are fast testing technologies and therefore could be also used for inline inspection. However they have the disadvantage of less detailed information compared to CT. In order to combine the advantages and overcome the disadvantages, CT is used as reference technology for the <b>inline</b> <b>testing</b> methods. This means that ultrasonic or thermography systems are qualified by the referencing process to detect defects {{so that they can}} deliver reliable inspection results within the production process. For this purpose it is absolutely necessary to easily compare the different kind of NDT methods. This has been achieved by developing a NDT software platform for loading, visualising and analysing ultrasonic, thermographic and CT data. This platform enables the user to analyse data sets of the different technologies in one single software package and to easily compare and also combine the results. For CT data evaluation advanced and adapted algorithms have been developed and integrated in the software platform, which allow automated defect detection and porosity analysis. In addition the fibre orientation can be determined based on a new 3 D texture analysis algorithm. For 2 D evaluation of ultrasound and thermography data advanced and automated defect detection algorithms have been implemented and included into the software platform. As some defects are only visible in one of the two testing technologies, a data fusion algorithm has been developed which combines the two analysis results. Through this procedure extensive failure detection is achieved. The new machine vision platform for NDT has been tested on selected data sets generated from real as well as special test parts. The evaluation results are promising and show clearly the possibilities offered for visualisation, analysis and data fusion for CT, thermography and ultrasound inspection...|$|R

40|$|Runoff waters {{generated}} on highway construction sites can have turbidities {{in excess of}} the proposed EPA regulatory standard of 280 NTU due to large areas of exposed soil. The objective of this research was to develop best management practices (BMPs) for the use of anionic polyacrylamide (PAM) based Floc Logs, for turbidity control. Five commercially available types of PAM-based Floc Logs were evaluated in jar tests, using soil excavated from Cato Springs Research Center (CSRC, Fayetteville AR) and six types of clay from the Clay Minerals Society (Chantilly, VA). These results show that no single Floc Log type was suitable for all six types of clay, and that jar tests should be conducted using field soils to select the appropriate Floc Log type for turbidity control. Results from the jar tests were also interpreted alongside particle size distributions (PSDs) of each type of clay, which were measured by Coulter Counter. These results suggested that particle surface charge, and not PSD, was the dominant flocculation mechanism for the clays used in the jar <b>tests.</b> Subsequent <b>inline</b> channel <b>tests</b> at the CSRC and at the Bella Vista Bypass showed little to no turbidity reduction, which was attributed to insufficient PAM dosing, mixing, and/or settling time. However, results from basin-scale sedimentation tests at the CSRC showed that a single Floc Log was capable to treating more than 2, 000 L of turbid water (i. e., 95 - 99 % turbidity reduction in ~ 5 minutes) provided that the Floc Log was presoaked in tap water for 15 minutes. The Floc Log was capable to being reused without compromising turbidity reduction, provided a turbulent mixing period of at least 15 minutes. On balance, PAM-based Floc Logs were shown to be an effective tool to treat turbid water in sedimentation basins provided a period of rapid mixing...|$|R

Cleanrooms control impurities,process control controls processing, and burn-in (short term operation at extremes) and probe and test reduce escapes. Probe (wafer prober) tests the semiconductor die, prior to packaging, via micro-probes connected to test equipment. Wafer testing tests the packaged device, often pre-, and post burn-in {{for a set}} of parameters that assure operation. Process and design weaknesses are identified by applying a set of stress tests in the qualification phase of the semiconductors before their market introduction e. g. according to the AEC Q100 and Q101 stress qualifications. Parts Average Testing is a statistical method for recognizing and quarantining semiconductor die that have a higher probability of reliability failures. This technique identifies characteristics that are within specification but outside of a normal distribution for that population as at-risk outliers not suitable for high reliability applications.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{combined}} procedure {{to determine the}} forming limit diagram (Keeler-Goodwin diagram) for thick sheets is proposed. It is defined for cold rolled steel sheet Č 0147 (RSt 13 DIN 17006) with thickness of 5 mm using two different criteria: maximum uniform elongation and the criteria of tearing. For the area of one positive and one negative strain (the left part of the diagram) the curves of limit strain are determined using the method of <b>inline</b> stretch of <b>test</b> tubes with circular lateral clips of sheet with thickness of 5 mm. The curves of limit strain are gained by drawing using rough hemispherical punch of sheet strips with different widths for the same quality of the material, but with thickness of 1 mm. For the area of two positive strains (the right part), the curves of limit strain for sheet with thickness of 5 mm are determined so that, in continuation to the right end side of the limit curves, gained with stretching of the test tubes with circular lateral clips, the for material with thickness of 1 mm are drawn, retaining the same form in the process.

40|$|The {{semiconductor}} {{market was}} valued at over $ 270 billion in 2007, with projections to continue steady growth [7]. Any manufacturing process of this volume is tightly controlled to ensure high efficiency, and improvements are readily sought after. Despite semiconductor fabrication process advancements allowing circuits to contain {{larger numbers of}} transistors in smaller package sizes, {{there has not been}} any significant change in the way these circuits interface with test systems before packaging. This limitation causes the area overhead occupied by circuit contacts, known as bond pads, to become increasingly costly. To amend the situation, VLSI designers have attempted to reduce bond pads size and pitch as much as possible while retaining reliable probing accuracy [15]. Currently, there is no standard solution to assess the accuracy of probe stations <b>inline</b> with wafer <b>testing.</b> As such, a balance must be struck between overhead cost of large bond pads and operational cost spent analyzing probe performance off-line. A feedback loop on probe card performance during wafer fabrication sort could allow plants to recalibrate probe cards before a yield drop is detected, thus improving yield and saving operational costs [26]. This thesis demonstrates a proof of concept design that offers a viable solution to perform probe metrology in-line with wafer-level circuit testing.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} examine the {{reliability}} and validity of the <b>inline</b> skating skill <b>test.</b> Based on previous skating experience forty-two skaters (26 female and 16 male) were randomized into two groups (competitive level vs. recreational level). They performed the test four times, with a recovery time of 45 minutes between sessions. Prior to testing, the participants rated their skating skill using a scale from 1 to 10. The protocol included performance time measurement through a course, combining different skating techniques. Trivial changes in performance time between the repeated sessions were determined in both competitive females/males and recreational females/males (- 1. 7 % [95 % CI: - 5. 8 – 2. 6 %] – 2. 2 % [95 % CI: 0. 0 – 4. 5 %]). In all four subgroups, the skill test had a low mean within-individual variation (1. 6 % [95 % CI: 1. 2 – 2. 4 %] – 2. 7 % [95 % CI: 2. 1 – 4. 0 %]) and high mean inter-session correlation (ICC = 0. 97 [95 % CI: 0. 92 – 0. 99] – 0. 99 [95 % CI: 0. 98 – 1. 00]). The comparison of detected typical errors and smallest worthwhile changes (calculated as standard deviations × 0. 2) revealed that the skill test was able to track changes in skaters’ performances. Competitive-level skaters needed shorter time (24. 4 – 26. 4 %, all p < 0. 01) to complete the test in comparison to recreational-level skaters. Moreover, moderate correlation (ρ = 0. 80 – 0. 82; all p < 0. 01) was observed between the participant’s self-rating and achieved performance times. In conclusion, the proposed test is a reliable and valid method to evaluate inline skating skills in amateur competitive and recreational level skaters. Further studies are needed to evaluate the reproducibility of this skill test in different populations including elite inline skaters...|$|R
40|$|The {{vision of}} wood as an {{engineering}} material and a first choice in buildings, constructions and furniture production put high demands on measuring equipment which can define {{and determine the}} quality of boards and planks. The moisture content in wood is a quality factor that is all too often badly described when sawn goods is delivered, but still {{it is an important}} factor in the further processing. This thesis is a part of a project, where the objective is to find or develop measuring equipment which can determine the moisture content between 7 to 18 % MC with an accuracy of ± 1 % (90 % confidence interval). Within the frames of this thesis, three moisture content meters for <b>inline</b> use where <b>tested.</b> A test material with five wood classes was produced. Each class included approximately twenty pieces. The intention with the wood classes was to find differences between the meters in how they handle different types of wood. Two of the equipments were tested in industry and the third in the lab. The meters were calibrated with the same material within the span 8 to 17, 5 % MC. The test material was then fed through the meters and the values were logged. The results were analyzed in regard to the measuring technique or method the meter was using. According to the results, there are differences between the methods. The MC meter which is using the capacitance method shows too high values when measuring high density pieces compared to low density pieces with the same moisture content. This is a result of the nature of capacitance, which mostly depends on the amount of water and not the fraction between water and wood. The results also showed that the meter which used the shortest wavelength (microwaves) measured too high values in and around knots. The reason for this behavior is unclear, but could be explained by diffraction around the knot due to the higher density. In general, the MC meters showed good accuracy.
