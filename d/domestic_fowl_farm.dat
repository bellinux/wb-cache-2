40|$|Poultry birds. <b>Domestic</b> <b>fowl</b> and broiler are {{constantly}} in exposure of both ecto-parasites and endoparasites. The parasitic infestation badly affect {{the industry in}} various ways, low weight birds, meat with low quality in taste and nutrients, weight reduction etc. The present study shows that broiler bird is less infected by ecto-parasites and gastrointestinal; parasites as compared to <b>domestic</b> <b>fowls.</b> Among the infected ecto-parasites lice infestation is more pronounced than other. Similarly male fowl is more prone to ectoparasites than female. The same trend was observed in gastrointestinal parasites, where broiler is less affected than <b>domestic</b> <b>fowl,</b> and female is less infected than male. The study indicates that free system in <b>domestic</b> <b>fowl</b> {{is the reason for}} the heavy infestation of both the ecto and endo parasites in <b>domestic</b> <b>fowl.</b> The closed system habitat practice in <b>domestic</b> <b>fowl</b> may reduce the infestation of ecto and endo parasites in <b>domestic</b> <b>fowl.</b> A stringent action plan both form villagers and Government supporters is needed to protect the <b>domestic</b> <b>fowl</b> from parasitic infestation.

50|$|There {{are some}} controversies around {{origin of the}} Polish chicken's breed. Some state that the breed has Polish origin. These doubts might have arisen due to {{generally}} limited access to original sources documenting the Czubatka's (Polish chickens') presence {{in the history of}} Poland, caused by the fact that these testimonies are available in Polish language only. The Polish chicken breed's original, i.e. Polish, name is: Czubatka (ˈtʃubætkə). For centuries Poles kept their Czubatka <b>domestic</b> <b>fowls</b> in small <b>farms</b> scattered all over Polish territories. The full name of Polish chicken is 'Czubatka Staropolska' or 'Czubatka Dworska', where in Polish language 'Czubatka' simply indicates a hen or rooster with 'czub' (a tuft of feathers growing on top of the head), the word 'Staropolska' is an adjective meaning 'old-Polish' and the alternative nickname 'Dworska' is an adjective meaning 'court'. The Czubatka has multiple representations in Polish literature and art, and the Czubatka rooster is an iconic image symbolizing a country gentleman - character. To wind down, it is worth to mention, that the Czubatka poultry had been looking and behaving exactly like the contemporary Polish chickens do today for long (first accounts come from Middle Ages) before it was firstly introduced to Dutch breeders as the Polish chicken.|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the productivity and reproductive performance of seven free-range local <b>domestic</b> <b>fowl</b> ecotypes in Tanzania named Ching'wekwe, Mbeya, Morogoro-medium, N'zenzegere, Pemba, Tanga and Unguja. Average weekly weight measurements and growth rates were evaluated for each ecotype and sex as was egg weight, fertility and hatchability. Significant differences existed between ecotypes in all the five parameters studied. Ching'wekwe showed consistently low mean weekly weights, daily growth rate and mean egg weight contrary to Morogoro-medium and Tanga ecotypes. Egg fertility was low with only N'zenzegere and Unguja ecotypes exceeding 75 %. Hatchability was also low ranging from 55 % (Ching'wekwe and Morogoro-medium) to 74 % (Pemba). It was concluded that genetic and phenotypic diversity exists in the local <b>domestic</b> <b>fowl</b> ecotypes of Tanzania. The diversity constitutes a valuable resource for use in breeding programmes for improvement of the health and productivity of the local <b>domestic</b> <b>fowls</b> and in designing proper conservation strategies.

40|$|Summary. Mature male {{rats and}} <b>domestic</b> <b>fowl</b> were {{injected}} sub-cutaneously with 109 CdCl 2; some rats were pre-treated 24 or 2 hr previously with Zn or Se, respectively. Testis, muscle and liver samples were taken at 5, 10, 20 or 40 min post-injection. Tissues were homogen-ized and centrifuged to obtain nuclear, heavy and light mitochondrial, microsomal, {{and the resultant}} 103, 000 g supernate fractions. This supernate was partitioned by acetone which resulted in non-protein and protein-bound Cd fractions. In the liver nuclear fraction, there was only 10 % of the total 109 Cd compared to 50 and 30 % in the muscle and testis, respectively. These trends were reversed in the 103, 000 g supernate. Pre-treatment with Zn or Se reduced the 109 Cd in this fraction in the testis and muscle. In these organs, there was more 109 Cd in the mito-chondrial fractions of the <b>domestic</b> <b>fowl</b> than in the rat. Pre-treatments decreased 109 Cd in the testicular microsomes and in the protein of the 103, 000 g supernate. After 5 min, there was essentially no free element in the testis of the <b>domestic</b> <b>fowl.</b> If subcellular location is indicative, the <b>domestic</b> <b>fowl</b> and the Zn and Se pre-treated rats appear to have very different mechanisms of defence against Cd...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Rescue {{excavations}} in Gdañsk and Koobrzeg {{starting in}} the early 1990 ’s pro-vided new hand collected bird remains. The present paper deals {{with the results of}} bird re-mains analyses of three sites from Gdañsk (12 th- 18 th century) and one site from Koobrzeg (10 th- 12 th century). The most frequent bird species was <b>domestic</b> <b>fowl,</b> fol-lowed by goose, and ducks both in Gdañsk and Koobrzeg. The list of wild species con-tains White-tailed Eagle, Crane and Capercaillie most frequently. Introduced species are documented from Gdañsk in the form of one bone of peafowl and several turkey remains. The Gdañsk material exhibits a decrease in the relative frequency of <b>domestic</b> <b>fowl</b> and an increase in the relative frequency of goose over time, reflecting a gradual increase in goose breeding starting in Late Medieval time.

Three years in high school were followed by work in engineering and three years on a technical college course. From 1939, interrupted by army service during World War II, he operated as amateur radio station. In 1965, in conjunction with his son David, he started to breed Pekin Bantams and they became members of the NSW Pekin Bantam Club.
