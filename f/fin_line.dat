5000|$|The C.140 was {{powered by}} an uncowled [...] Salmson 9AB nine {{cylinder}} radial engine, mounted on duralumin bearers. In {{the case of}} a fire, the 200 L fuel tank could be jettisoned in flight. Behind the engine the fuselage was of mixed construction and a deep oval in section, with multiple longitudinal members. The pilot sat in the forward, open cockpit under the rear of the wing with the observer was close behind, about half way to the tail where there was a shallow triangular fin with a parallel edged rudder with a tip continuing the upper <b>fin</b> <b>line</b> and a lower edge reaching to the keel. The small tailplane was rectangular in plan and carried larger area, overhanging balanced elevators with a small cut-out for rudder movement. The C.140 had a tail skid undercarriage with its main wheels on a single axle, sprung to two sets of steel V-struts from the lower wing root.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{mounting}} grooves and serration patterns of <b>fin</b> <b>line</b> circuits are investigated experimentally. Our measurements {{show that the}} short-circuit ended mounting grooves degrade seriously the insertion loss of fin lines at the low frequencies of the band. The open ended mounting grooves are found better for fin lines applications and measurements. An improvement of 0. 7 dB is observed over the whole band, when the serration patterns of the <b>fin</b> <b>line</b> are placed into the open-ended mounting grooves. These results {{can be used for}} measuring the losses and for designing transitions or other <b>fin</b> <b>line</b> circuits...|$|E

The simulations follow a $ 3 times 3 times 3 = 27 $ experiment design that covers the process variability space, and 1000 statistical simulations are carried out at each node of the experiment. Both metal-gate-first and metal-gate-last technologies are considered. It is found that statistical variability is significantly dependent on the process-induced variability. The applicability of the Pelgrom law to the FinFET statistical variability, subject to long-range process variations, is also examined.

50|$|The redfin pickerel, {{like other}} fish of the Esox genus, is well adapted to sprint predation. The {{posterior}} {{positioning of the}} unpaired fins is testament to this, the dorsal <b>fin</b> <b>lining</b> up with the anal fin, and the ventral more rearward than would be found on other fish body types. The pectorals are shrunken to streamline the fish, while the caudal fin is rather large so as to provide considerable thrust. Further adaptations correlating with their rushing style is a hydrodynamic tube shaped body, a flat nose, and an unadorned head.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel broad band Spatial Power Combiner (SPC) Amplifier based on Square Coaxial (Squarax) Transmission Line (TL), able {{to tolerate the}} Thermo-Mechanical effects due to the transistor heating. In the proposed SPC, <b>Fin</b> <b>Line</b> to microstrip transitions (FLuS) are inserted into the Squarax TL, in order to connect many Monolithic Mi- crowave Integrated Circuit (MMIC) Solid State Power Ampli¯er (SSPA) while maintaining an easy integration. The proposed structure has some advantages over the traditional SPC's. The Squarax SPC geometry allows the feeding of a higher number of MMIC than in a Waveguide SPC, and its straight pro¯le allows to connect simple and low-cost square or rectangular heat-sink devices with high thermal dissipation attitude. Conversely, coaxial SPC needs apposite circular heat-sinkers that requires expensive custom production. Squarax structure ensures high power outputs and small sizes, together with theoretical DC frequency cut-o®. In this work, a 16 cards Squarax SPC in the operative bandwidth 418 GHz has been designed, able to account for 32 MMIC SSPA's.

40|$|The Muller-Lyer {{illusion}} {{is where}} the perceived length of lines is altered when the shafts are terminated by various <b>fins.</b> <b>Lines</b> appear shorter in a 'wings-in' configuration versus longer in a 'wings-out' configuration. Explanations for this effect range from low level signal processing to the misapplication of rules from higher cognitive areas. Computer models that mimic visual processing allow {{for some of these}} proposed contributing factors to be tested in isolation. The HMAX model is a current state-of-the-art object recognition model that is also biologically plausible [Mutch and Lowe, 2008 International Journal of Computer Vision 80 (1) 45 - 57]. We trained this model to perform a dual categorisation task based on relative line lengths within an image. We then measured the accuracy of the system in categorising control images versus illusory images. Our results indicate this feed-forward model replicated an overall illusory effect. 1 page(s...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the design {{based on a}} Multiphysics simulation for a waveguide X-Band Fin Taper (FT) Spatial Power Combiner. The proposed device uses <b>Fin</b> <b>Lines</b> to microstrip transition (FLuS) to convert the energy from a rectangular waveguide (WG) TE 10 fundamental mode to a microstrip (μS) transmission line (TL) quasi-TEM (q-TEM) mode, {{in order to be}} amplified by Solid-State Power Amplifiers. An alteration of the electromagnetic behavior can be produced by the temperature increase and the geometrical displacement induced by the thermal expansion of the structure due to the power dissipation of the MMIC amplifiers. A proper multiphysics model is proposed to select materials and shapes of the probes and their support (carrier), considering the thermo-mechanical operative condition. A virtual prototyping technique is proposed: electric field and S-parameters’ computation in such critical conditions are shown. The proposed study has allowed for the proper thermo-mechanical design for such amplifiers; hence, best materials and technologies have been chose...|$|R

40|$|This article {{describes}} the complete design of high performances Ka-Band small size Spatial Power Combiner (SPC) Ampli¯er. Several multiple physics aspects are treated in the proposed study as electromagnetic behavior and thermo-mechanical features. The combiner consists of quadruple <b>Fin</b> <b>lines</b> to microstrip (FLuS) transitions inserted into a WR 28 waveguide T-junction. In this structure, 16 Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit (MMIC) Solid State Power Ampli¯ers (SSPA's) are integrated.

50|$|The {{checkered}} puffer, Sphoeroides testudineus, is one {{of several}} fish species belonging to the family Tetradontidae, meaning “four teeth”. Puffers have four tooth plates arranged in quadrants, with two teeth on the bottom and two on the top (Carpenter 2002). These teeth form a strong, heavy beak capable of cracking through hard prey such as mollusks and crustaceans. Puffers are named for their ability to swell by swallowing water or air when threatened. They have no spinous dorsal fin, absent or reduced scales, sandpapery denticles on various areas of the body, and a reduced gill opening. Identification of species is determined in part through color, pattern, and the presence and number of spines and fleshy tabs, or lappets, on the skin (Robins & Ray 1986). The checkered puffer is pale tan to yellowish with a polygonal or square network of lines centered on a bulls-eye pattern on the midback in front of the dorsal <b>fin.</b> <b>Lines</b> are dark gray to olive, with small, dark brown spots on cheeks and lower sides. The abdomen is whitish and unmarked. Dark bands are present on the caudal fin.|$|R
