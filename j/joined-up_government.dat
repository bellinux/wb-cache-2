40|$|This article {{examines}} the role of regulation in reforming public services in England and Wales. Specifically it analyses the impact of public service-regulation for two important elements of the present Labour Government's modernisation agenda: <b>joined-up</b> <b>government</b> and partnerships. The rhetoric of <b>joined-up</b> <b>government</b> and partnerships is strong in government pronouncements, and embraces not only collaborative working between public sector agencies but also collaborative working {{between public and private}} sector agencies in the delivery of public services. Local housing authorities and housing associations have worked togetherfor many years to provide social housing. However, these pioneers of public-private partnerships have been, and continue to be, subject to very different regulatory regimes affecting {{the way in which they}} operate. The article argues that more <b>joined-up</b> <b>government</b> not only necessitates partnership-working between policy-makers and service-providers, but also between the key regulatory agencies which oversee the delivery ofpublic services. There are dangers, however, that rivalry between regulatory agencies and regulatory capture may frustrate moves towards <b>joined-up</b> <b>government.</b> <b>Joined-up</b> <b>government,</b> therefore, requires joined-up regulation otherwise so-called "wicked problems " that spread across the joins of government are likely to remain unsolved or at best partially solved...|$|E
40|$|<b>Joined-up</b> <b>government</b> {{is often}} viewed as a remedy for {{coordination}} problems arising in the complex multi-organisational terrain of contemporary public services. Governments extol the virtues of formal coordination mechanisms as tools of <b>joined-up</b> <b>government,</b> both locally and centrally. Such policy exhortations conceive of <b>joined-up</b> <b>government</b> from a rational-administrative perspective which implies that actors adopt coordination mechanisms as a functional response to systemic problems. This paper explores the rationale behind the selection of coordination mechanisms {{from the perspective of}} policy actors at different levels of government, using evidence from a recent study of <b>joined-up</b> <b>government</b> in the field of homelessness. It is argued that decisions about joining-up are the outcome of strategic and instrumental moves between actors, with each pursuing their own organisational interests and the outcome favouring the most powerful, motivations that are better encapsulated by a bureaucratic politics model. Key aspects dominating collaborative decision-making include prioritisation of, and a desire to protect resources for, agencies’ and departments’ own client groups; the greater ability of the most powerful actors to gain the cooperation of other bodies in order to advance their own organisational agendas; and the adoption of coordination mechanisms to reduce risk and maintain organisational surviva...|$|E
40|$|Community {{energy has}} been {{proposed}} as a new policy tool to help achieve {{the transition to a}} low-carbon energy system, but the evidence base for this strategy is partial and fragmented. We therefore present new empirical evidence from the first independent UK-wide survey of community energy projects. Our survey investigates the objectives, origins and development of these groups across the UK, their activities and their networking activities as a sector. We also examine {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} these groups, along with the opportunities and threats presented by wider socioeconomic and political contexts, in order to improve understanding of the sector's potential and the challenges it faces. We highlight several key issues concerning the further development of the sector. First, this highly diverse sector is not reducible to a single entity; its multiple objectives need <b>joined-up</b> thinking among <b>government</b> departments. Second, its civil society basis is fundamental to its success at engaging local communities, and makes the sector quite distinct from the large energy companies these community groups are aiming to work alongside. There are inherent tensions and vulnerabilities in such a model, and limits to how much these groups can achieve on their own: consistent policy support is essential...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{evidence}} {{base for}} the impact of social determinants of health has been strengthened considerably in the last decade. Increasingly, the public health field is using this as a foundation for arguments and actions to change government policies. The Health in All Policies (HiAP) approach, alongside recommendations from the 2010 Marmot Review into health inequalities in the UK (which we refer to as the ‘Fairness Agenda’), go beyond advocating for the redesign of individual policies, to shaping the government structures and processes that facilitate the implementation of these policies. In doing so, public health is drawing on recent trends in public policy towards ‘joined up government’, where greater integration is sought between government departments, agencies and actors outside of government. Methods: In this paper we provide a meta-synthesis of the empirical public policy research into joined up government, drawing out characteristics associated with successful joined up initiatives. We use this thematic synthesis as a basis for comparing and contrasting emerging public health interventions concerned with <b>joined-up</b> action across <b>government.</b> Results: We find that HiAP and the Fairness Agenda exhibit some of the characteristics associated with successful joined up initiatives, however they also utilise ‘change instruments’ that {{have been found to be}} ineffective. Moreover, we find that – like many joined up initiatives – there is room for improvement in the alignment between the goals of the interventions and their design.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether {{reforms to}} {{the machinery of}} government under New Labour can help to explain immigration policy change. Taking a new institutionalist approach, the paper argues that immigration policy change was partly shaped by processes of departmentalism, the <b>joined-up</b> <b>government</b> strategy and the consequential introduction of new policy actors into what had hitherto been a more tightly-knit policy network. The paper further argues that because the policymaking process has long been organised around the Whitehall model, departments have an organisational culture which shapes and structures the way policymakers perceive and frame a policy issue. When, however, actors move between departments - {{as a consequence of}} <b>joined-up</b> <b>government</b> - they apply knowledge and culture acquired from their previous department and transfer them to new policy areas.

40|$|Joining up {{remains a}} high {{priority}} on the e-government agenda and requires extensive transformation. Stage models are predictable patterns which exist {{in the growth of}} organizations and unfold as discrete time periods that result in discontinuity and can help e-government development towards <b>joined-up</b> <b>government.</b> Although stage models may be conceptually appealing, these models are often not empirically validated, do not transcend the level of individual organizations, and provide little practical support to policymakers. Furthermore, they do not include the dynamic capabilities needed by organizations to transform from one stage to the next stage. In this paper, a five-stage model is presented that describes the progression from stove-piped situations towards a nationwide, customer-oriented, and <b>joined-up</b> <b>government.</b> The dynamic capabilities needed for realizing each stage are identified. This model is empirically validated and helps government agencies benchmark their position, realize their role in the formation of a <b>joined-up</b> <b>government,</b> develop the necessary capabilities, and adopt centrally developed infrastructural facilities aimed at moving to the next stage. We found that growth stages are useful for providing guidance and can be used by policymakers to stimulate the developments of capabilities needed by organizations to migrate from one stage to anothe...|$|E
40|$|Identifying anti-crisis {{solutions}} {{represents one}} of the main objectives of central and local government bodies. The rigidity of the administrative structures has as a main results the incapacity of this system to react in an active and flexible manner, to the fluctuations that are been generated by the economic environment - economic crisis forcing the state to start a complex process of administrative reform, in order to increase adaptability, quantified by expanding the capacity of reaction. Special attention must be given in time of crisis to local government, and to the local development, by making a direct connection between central and local bodies, generating a complex process of coordination that must take place between those two levels and giving the possibility to applying the concept of <b>joined-up</b> <b>government</b> at the level of metropolitan areas. From the perspective of this paper, metropolitan areas should act as a middle government, responsible for the identification and implementation of the anti-crisis measures at the local and regional level, representing {{at the same time the}} place of convergence for the decentralization process and <b>joined-up</b> <b>government</b> process. From this regard, the concept of decentralization will be presented, the author going to ascertain that financial decentralization should stop at the metropolitan area level and be aimed, on the basis of the principle of specialization (one of the establishing principles of metropolitan areas), especially at the areas of responsibility delegated to exercise by the local governments, this set of core competencies representing the area of implementation of the concept of <b>joined-up</b> <b>government.</b> The applicability of the <b>joined-up</b> <b>government</b> concept can be seen as a first measure that the administrative system can generate and implement, through a comprehensive process aimed at rethinking the operation and the organization of the administrative structures.

The role of those organisms is to coordinate the implementation process of the anti-crisis policies throughout the entire region, contributing to the coherence and the effectiveness of these policies.

40|$|Abstract This article {{examines}} New Labour’s approach to <b>joined-up</b> <b>government</b> within UK urban policy. In particular, it analyses the government’s success in achieving greater degrees of integration in urban governance. It {{suggests that the}} {{growth in the number of}} multi-sectoral partnership schemes and area-based urban policies under Labour produced tensions with key elements of its <b>joined-up</b> <b>government</b> agenda. The {{article examines}} the rationale underpinning the government’s approach to ’joined-up governance ’ and explores the processes by which the government sought to encourage the reorganization of urban governance through the institutional development of strategic and single-purpose partnership bodies. It also highlights the effects of these processes on the ground through an examination of developments in the city of Sheffield. It explores changes in the structure of urban governance in the city in response to national restructuring and local agendas, highlighting the importance of local leadership in providing coherence to urban governance and indicates some democratic tensions that have arisen...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} two years the UK {{government}} has been promoting the concept of ‘joined-up government’ as a way to improve service delivery and policy making in areas which affect people’s quality of life such as health, education and employment. The recent White Paper on Modernising Government reiterates the concept stating that modernisation in the national government can be achieved devising new ways of preparing policies and programmes that are based on the close relationship of different departments and agencies both at the national and local level. In practical terms <b>joined-up</b> <b>government</b> means that better services and better policy making can be achieved tackling issues such as health and crime in an integrated fashion. The <b>joined-up</b> <b>government</b> approach to deliver better public services at the local level has focused on both area-based programmes such as Action Zones in the areas of health, education and employment, and the New Deal for Communities; and group-based programmes such as the New Deal for the Young Unemployed and the Better Government for the Older People. The first type of programmes stems from the recognition that areas of deprivation need a multi-agency and cross-sectoral approach for their regeneration. For instance the establishment of Health Action Zones is based on the notion that there is a link between health and inequalities and to improve areas of ill...|$|E

It develops a theoretical model in which regime complexes become denser over time while governmental policymaking becomes more coherent. Under this model, interactions between global regime complexes and national policymaking are twofold. On the one hand, greater policy coherence generates negotiated mandates asking for regime connections and complex density. On the other hand, regime-complex density creates more cohesive audiences, which increase incentives for national policy coherence. This co-adjustments model brings states into the discussion of institutional interactions and critically questions the desirability and feasibility of recent calls for <b>joined-up</b> <b>government</b> and whole-of-government approaches.

To date, however, there are still {{surprisingly}} few detailed empirical studies of how well JUG initiatives are performing.

Overall, it demonstrates that joining-up by centralized means has been unable to override the forces of departmentalism, which are shown to be deeply rooted in departments' approaches to policy appraisal. It then argues that addressing this problem will require a carefully designed package of centralised initiatives to minimize departmental discretion, and a series of more diffuse tools and administrative capacities to encourage departmental policy makers to coordinate. Without such a two pronged approach, Labour's pursuit of more joined-up policy making may be severely undermined...|$|E

40|$|In {{response}} to economic pressures {{and the growing}} expectation of citizens, the framework of service delivery in the public service sector has changed continually. Market-based reform strategies such as privatisation, corporatisation, <b>joined-up</b> <b>government</b> and public-private partnerships have dominated the current framework of public service delivery around the globe. The adoption of these strategies has changed not only the framework of service delivery but also the notion of accountability. The objective {{of this paper is}} to examine the way in which the notion of accountability has developed in public service delivery, focusing on the adoption of policy strategies under the market state model. Studies show that the framework of accountability in the context of public sector reform appears to be complex, especially in the era of market state model. The involvement of the private sector as a public partner in delivering public services has significantly changed the notion of accountability and we argue that to some extent accountability tends to be eclipsed due to the changes in its accountability focus...|$|E
40|$|Since {{its early}} days, e-Government {{has been the}} source of great expectations. Presently e-Government is pursued as both a way of {{increasing}} government productivity and efficiency and as a key enabler of citizen-centric, cooperative, "seamless", but polycentric, modern governance. This implies a profound transformation in the way government interacts with the governed but also the reinvention of its internal processes and organisation, including Government-to-Government (G 2 G) interactions. From this starting point, this paper investigates e-Government from a citizen’s perspective under the light of both Government-to-Citizen (G 2 C) and Citizen-to-Government (C 2 G) relations. Such a “joined-up government ” approach, which builds G 2 C and C 2 G relationships on a backbone of good G 2 G synergy, may be pivotal for improving of the services offered to citizens.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to examine}} {{an early stage of}} the institutionalization of {{accounting}} practices in devolved UK governments, concentrating on: the construction by devolved bodies of a “rational” set of planning and budgeting documents; the extent of homogeneity/heterogeneity in organizational response to seemingly similar institutional pressures; and politicians' cognition of accounting numbers. Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses neo-institutional theory to examine the planning and budgeting documents of the devolved bodies and material gathered from semi-structured interviews. Findings – The findings point to a process of nested translations, from mission through aims and objectives to targets, with accounting numbers present only in the last stage whereby time-bounded targets are formulated and used to assess achievements. Because of the negotiations around the diverging interests of actors, the translation process is neither linear nor stable. Originality/value – The paper contributes to the literature by: examining the emergence and use of new accounting and budgeting systems in political organizations; understanding the experience of institutionalization of accounting practices; and exploring the impact of accounting reform on political deliberation and <b>joined-up</b> <b>government.</b> Accounting, Budgetary control, Business planning, Government, Organizations, United Kingdom...|$|E

This paper draws on Foucault’s account of the various forms of governmental power to dissect and interrogate emerging e-government forms, as evidenced in reforms in welfare policy and administration. While the neo-liberal, neo-conservative and authoritarian character of recent welfare policy has received considerable attention, changes in welfare administration and governance are scarcely analysed.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the use of {{geographical}} information systems (GIS) within primary and secondary health care sectors in the United Kingdom in relation to wider notions of 'joined-up' government [...] a key tenet of central government initiatives aimed at addressing problems such as social exclusion and polarisation. Drawing on findings from a national-level questionnaire survey, and follow-up semi-structured interviews with key respondents from the National Health Service (NHS), we have found that there has been an increase in GIS uptake within health organisations in the last decade. However, there has been limited collaboration between NHS organisations and local authorities on projects that utilise GIS. This lack of interorganisational activity is underpinned by the lack of a service-level agreement for digital data provision within NHS organisations, ambiguous understandings of data confidentiality requirements, and a limited awareness of the benefits of joined-up working arrangements. The paper concludes with a suggestion that significant organisational and cultural changes are required to facilitate enabling contexts for enhanced collaborative use of GIS between NHS organisations and local authorities, in order to support the wider <b>joined-up</b> <b>government</b> agenda currently being promoted in the United Kingdom. ...|$|E
40|$|Privatisation and {{contracting}} out have exacerbated the silo effect {{associated with the}} existence of separate government departments and agencies. The gaps created {{by the lack of}} integration between service providers and government have led to a range of solutions known variously as whole of government, connecting government and <b>joined-up</b> <b>government.</b> These are pragmatic solutions. On the one hand they recognise the failure of current agendas to provide coordinated government services, and on the other, the reluctance of western governments to resume traditional service provision. It is significant that the models underlying much of the whole of government response in Australia originate from the joined-up approaches implemented in the UK. These focus on horizontal coordination in a unitary state (Chandler 2000). However, in a federation such as Australia, state governments are constitutionally responsible for important public services. Some of these responsibilities are shared with the federal government. Simply adopting horizontal solutions in Australia threatens to create new gaps. The challenge is to manage the accountability, governance and coordination issues arising from horizontal whole of government initiatives. This paper outlines the issues facing the Australian federation in implementing whole of government models and argues that, in the process of accommodating these initiatives within its federal structure, it is finally reinventing government...|$|E
40|$|Part 13 : Mining Approaches in Collaborative NetworksInternational audienceGovernments {{strive to}} achieve {{improvements}} in delivering public services, {{developing and implementing}} public policies, responding to crisis situations, and optimizing {{the use of public}} resources, among others. Achieving such goals requires collaboration across different levels and functions of government, and across public and private sectors in a <b>Joined-Up</b> <b>Government.</b> Establishing such collaboration requires information on prospective participants including their goals, resources, processes and services. Such information is rarely available in structured forms e. g. in databases, but instead scattered over government portals, publications and other textual sources. This paper proposes the use of semantic text mining for extracting collaboration-related information (focusing on government collaboration) from unstructured data sources. The proposed solution applies natural language processing techniques supported by the relevant domain and process ontologies. It consists of three steps: 1) extracting process-related information from textual sources, 2) creating process ontology instances from extracted information and 3) mining shared and integrated processes based on process instances and the service goal hierarchy in the domain ontology.

The analysis shows that SA HiAP had dual goals of facilitating <b>joined-up</b> <b>government</b> for co-benefits (process focus); and addressing social determinants of health and inequities through cross-sectoral policy activity (outcomes focus). Government agencies readily understood HiAP as providing tools for improving the process of intersectoral policy development, while the more distal outcome-focused intent of improving equity was not well understood and gained less traction. While some early rhetorical support existed for progressing an equity agenda through SA HiAP, subsequent economic pressures resulted in the government narrowing its priorities to economic goals. The paper concludes that SA HiAP’s initial intentions to address equity were only partially enacted and little was done to reduce inequities. Emerging opportunities in SA, and internationally, including the UN Sustainable Development Goals, may revive interest in addressing equity...|$|E
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} need for <b>joined-up</b> <b>government</b> and joint working between agencies and across sectors {{in order to address}} “wicked ” social problems and improve policy outcomes. Consequently, it has become imperative {{to understand the nature of}} policy network settings, and also the endogenous and exogenous factors that positively and negatively impact on interagency and intra-agency collaboration. From senior managers to front-line workers needing to work collaboratively to achieve outcomes, knowing the types of relationships people have with other agencies may assist in identifying where greater time could be spent improving existing relationships or making new ones. While it is easy to assume that more coordination and cooperation will automatically lead to better and more efficient policy outcomes, collaboration can often be resource intensive, slow the whole process down and actually inhibit the achievement of policy outcomes. Therefore, if agencies are going to invest time and money in collaborative efforts, they need some assurance that such investment will pay dividends. The policy implications for using network analysis within a social capital framework to study policy networks and partnerships are discussed in this article. This paper concludes by describing how a policy network/social capital framework approach could be used to examine the Strengthening Families interagency case management process used in New Zealand...|$|E
40|$|<b>Joined-up</b> <b>government</b> (JUG) {{has been}} a notable feature of many {{national}} governments, not least the UK Labour government (1997 onwards) {{with its emphasis on}} welfare modernisation, tackling engrained social problems, and evidence-based policy. This article focuses on the ways in which JUG has been implemented in England although we draw comparisons with the different approaches in Wales and Scotland, as devolution has provided an interesting natural experiment. Certainly during its early years in power, the Labour government regarded JUG as a critical mechanism to achieve its goal of narrowing the “health gap” between different social groups since the requisite policy response is, by general agreement, inter-sectoral and cross-governmental. Responsibility for tackling the health gap does not reside within one policy sector or department but rather is a total or whole government issue. This article reviews previous efforts to promote JUG in the area of health inequalities, examines the factors which have shaped JUG over the past 13 years or so, and evaluates its implementation. Although JUG has helped keep health inequalities on the policy agenda, the evidence from newly introduced structures and processes (such as targets and cross-departmental units and committees) suggests that JUG remains poorly integrated within the government machinery. Many of the basic dilemmas of JUG thus continue to apply to policies aimed at tackling health inequalities. The article draws conclusions about the impact of JUG in recent years and the likelihood of reducing health inequalities. A new approach to governance in respect of “wicked problems” (such as health inequalities) is called for...|$|E
