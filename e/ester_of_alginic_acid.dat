The brown algae, being in the division of Pheophyta, are brownish in color due to the large amounts of the caroteniod fucoxanthin masking the remaining pigments, chlorophyll a and c, β-carotene, and other xanthophylls. Cell walls are composed <b>of</b> <b>alginic</b> <b>acid</b> which can be extracted as algin or alginate, used for various industrial purposes. The brown algae {{range in size from}} small filaments to the largest marine algae. Most members of this division are almost exclusively of marine occurrence. Most of the brown algae grow in the intertidal belt and the upper littoral region (Abbott 1995). Two brown algae, Sargassum polycystum and Turbinaria ornata, which are common in southern part of Thailand (Lewmanomont 1995) were focused in this present study.|$|R
50|$|Eisenia arborea, or the {{southern}} sea palm (not {{to be confused}} with the sea palm), is a dominant species of kelp that is found in the Northern and Eastern Pacific from Vancouver Island, Canada south to Isla Magdalena, Mexico, and along the coast of Baja California. They are commonly found from the midtidal areas stretching to the subtidal areas. It is an edible seaweed, a source of nutrients for grazing marine invertebrates and a source <b>of</b> <b>alginic</b> <b>acid,</b> a food thickener. Some of the algas have a hollow stripe above its holdfast with two branches terminating in multiple blades. Eisenia arborea is studied in order to predict environmental stress in oceans intertidal zones. Hollow stripes where present when the Eisenia arborea did not receive essential nutrients for its thalli development. Eisenia arborea with hollow stripes are believed to be evolved algae in order to increase their survival in harsh living conditions. They play a huge role in determining environmental stress.|$|R
