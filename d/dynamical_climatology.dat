50|$|Carson {{joined the}} UK Meteorological Office in 1969, {{following}} his Ph.D from the Department of Applied Mathematics, University of Liverpool, {{working on the}} structure and evolution of the atmospheric boundary layer. He did early research {{on the development of}} atmospheric general circulation models. In 1982, he was appointed to Assistant Director within the Met Office, and led the Boundary Layer Research Branch and later the <b>Dynamical</b> <b>Climatology</b> Branch. For 1987-1989 Carson was seconded to the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) as their first Programme Director for atmospheric sciences. He returned to the Met. Office in January 1990 and became Director of Climate Research and then first Director of the Hadley Centre.|$|E
40|$|The Stratospheric Wind Infrared Limb Sounder (SWIRLS) {{is one of}} the {{instruments}} in the atmospheric sounder package to be flown by NASA on the Earth Observing System (EOS) B platform in the late 1990 's. SWIRLS is designed to measure the horizontal vector wind field, atmospheric temperature, and the abundances and distributions of ozone and nitrous oxide in the middle atmosphere. These measurements will constitute a <b>dynamical</b> <b>climatology</b> of the stratosphere covering time scales ranging from diurnal to interannual. In addition, the SWIRLS investigation will quantify the physical mechanisms responsible for the structure and variations of stratospheric circulation and temperature fields, including the transport of species, particularly ozone, heat and momentum. Existing data sets lack the combination of accuracy, global and temporal coverage, spatial resoultion and simultaneity required to distinguish unambiguosly between the roles of dynamical and chemical processes in determining the current distribution of ozone and its evolution in the future. The measurement objectives, measurement approach, and instrumentation of SWIRLS is described...|$|E
40|$|The {{growth and}} decay of {{continental}} ice sheets forms a key problem in <b>dynamical</b> <b>climatology.</b> Apart from knowledge about their behaviour for given external conditions, like {{the distribution of}} incoming solar energy, it is desirable {{to know something about}} their variability due to forcing with a stochastic character. This paper presents a simple model of ice-sheet variability in which the interaction between ice sheet and atmosphere is taken into account in a crude way. The model is formulated by a linear second-order differential equation describing the evolution of the ice-sheet size, and is stochastically forced by white noise representing year-to-year weather fluctuations. The results, statistics of ice-sheet size variability, are very sensitive to the model parameters prescribing the ice sheet-atmosphere interaction. For realistic values of those parameters, the standard deviation of the ice-sheet size (in north-south direction) is in the 10 - 500 km range for a large ice sheet, thus leaving much uncertainty. The main conclusion of the analysis is that stochastic forcing of ice sheets is important only if strong positive feedback between ice sheets and atmosphere exists...|$|E
40|$|In {{the scope}} of the ESA funded project "CHEOPS-GOME " (Climatology of Height-resolved Earth Ozone and Profiling Systems for GOME) a new {{up-to-date}} ozone profile climatology was gained. The Neural Network Ozone Retrieval System (NNORSY) was developed at the Center for Solar energy and Hydrogen Research (ZSW) for retrieval of total ozone columns and/or ozone profiles and applied on several satellite instruments, e. g. the TOVS (TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder) and GOME (Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment). Besides three look-up-table <b>climatologies</b> (LUTs) a <b>dynamical</b> software <b>climatology</b> based on neural network technique was developed (NN). The emphasize of this papter lies on the improvements gained by that dynamic approach. The NNORSY-CLIMATOLOGY was validated and compared to existent ozone climatologies. Examples of applications are presented. It is shown, that adding dynamical input information significantly improves the climatological ozone profile. All climatology products including software for dynamic version are freely available a...|$|R
40|$|The World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) {{was created}} to produce the first climatologically useful picture of the ocean {{circulation}} and its low-frequency variability. This goal is addressed here from the state estimate of the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) consortium, which uses {{almost all of the}} data obtained during WOCE and its aftermath along with the much improved general circulation modeling capabilities. A dynamically and data-consistent, time-evolving, state estimate is available depicting the ocean and its ice-cover over a 23 -year time-span, globally, from the sea surface to the sea floor. The resulting time-dependent 20 -year long climatology includes temperature, salinity, surface elevation, bottom pressure, sea-ice, and three components of velocity. Accompanying the state estimate are modified estimates of meteorological forcing-fields, ocean interior mixing coefficients, and initial conditions. Much spatial structure persists through the two decade averaging. Results here are primarily pictorial in nature, intended to give the wider community a sense of what is now available and useful and where more detailed analysis would be fruitful. An extended reference list is included. This preprint describes a twenty-year <b>dynamical</b> oceanic <b>climatology</b> derived from ECCO version 4, release 3. The associated fields will be made available on the ECCO data server ([URL] by NASA's Physical Oceanography and Modeling, Analysis and Prediction programs for the ECCO Consortium at MIT, AER, JPL. We thank all of the people, scientists, engineers, ships’ crews, program managers, who finally made possible the gathering of global ocean data, as well as all those who have worked on the ECCO system and models...|$|R
40|$|The general {{objective}} of the international MEDiterranean EXperiment (MEDEX) was the better understanding and forecasting of cyclones that produce high impact weather in the Mediterranean. This paper reviews the motivation and foundation of MEDEX, the gestation, history and organisation of the project, {{as well as the}} main products and scientific achievements obtained from it. MEDEX obtained the approval of World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) and can be considered as framed within other WMO actions, such as the ALPine EXperiment (ALPEX), the Mediterranean Cyclones Study Project (MCP) and, to a certain extent, THe Observing System Research and Predictability EXperiment (THORPEX) and the HYdrological cycle in Mediterranean EXperiment (HyMeX). Through two phases (2000 – 2005 and 2006 – 2010), MEDEX has produced a specific database, with information about cyclones and severe or high impact weather events, several main reports and a specific data targeting system field campaign (DTS-MEDEX- 2009). The scientific achievements are significant in fields like <b>climatology,</b> <b>dynamical</b> understanding of the physical processes and social impact of cyclones, as well as in aspects related to the location of sensitive zones for individual cases, the climatology of sensitivity zones and the improvement of the forecasts through innovative methods like mesoscale ensemble prediction systems...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{description}} {{and evaluation of}} the Chemistry-Climate Model (CCM) LMDz-REPROBUS, which couples interactively the extended version of the Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique General Circulation Model (LMDz GCM) and the stratospheric chemistry module of the REactive Processes Ruling the Ozone BUdget in the Stratosphere (REPROBUS) model. The transient simulation evaluated here covers the period 1980 – 1999. The introduction of an interactive stratospheric chemistry module improves the model <b>dynamical</b> <b>climatology,</b> with a substantial reduction of the temperature biases in the lower tropical stratosphere. However, at high latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere, a negative temperature bias, that is already present in the GCM version, albeit with a smaller magnitude, leads to an overestimation of the ozone depletion and its vertical extent in the CCM. This in turn contributes to maintain low polar temperatures in the vortex, delay the break-up of the vortex and the recovery of polar ozone. The latitudinal and vertical variation of {{the mean age of}} air compares favourable with estimates derived from long-lived species measurements, though the model mean age of air is 1 – 3 years too young in the middle stratosphere. The model also reproduces the observed "tape recorder" in tropical total hydrogen (=H 2 O+ 2 ×CH 4), but its propagation is about 30 % too fast and its signal fades away slightly too quickly. The analysis of the global distributions of CH 4 and N 2 O suggests that the subtropical transport barriers are correctly represented in the simulation. LMDz-REPROBUS also reproduces fairly well most of the spatial and seasonal variations of the stratospheric chemical species, in particular ozone. However, because of the Antarctic cold bias, large discrepancies are found for most species at high latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere during the spring and early summer. In the Northern Hemisphere, polar ozone depletion and its variability are underestimated in the simulation...|$|E
