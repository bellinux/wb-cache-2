30|$|The {{cumulative}} delay metric of SORP and DORP introduces switching delay, which is later referred by many other works. Switching delay {{is defined as}} the delay caused by switching among frequency bands. Another consideration is backoff delay that is caused by multi-flow interference within a frequency band. Cumulative delay is the sum of switching delay and backoff delay. DORP adds queuing delay caused by the transmission of other flows on the node to the {{cumulative delay}} calculation. Since SORP and DORP focus on delays, they are suitable for <b>delay-sensitive</b> <b>application.</b> They result in fairly low cumulative delay and smooth cumulative delay change in handling intersecting flows. On the other hand, WHAT metric claims to be able to capture the overall quality of a path to have multiple considerations and to enhance the network throughput. However, WHAT metric requires a tuning parameter in determining the metric value and path selection. This static, predefined tuning parameter would reduce the cognitive learning capability.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Digital {{subscriber}} lines (DSL) {{offer the}} possibility to deliver broadband services over the existing telephone network. Before deploying DSL, the subscriber loops must be tested {{to see whether they}} can support high-speed data services, and at what rate. With regards to Voice over IP, VoIP converts analog voice signals into IP packets and distributes them across a WAN. VoIP is a <b>delay-sensitive</b> <b>application.</b> For POTS-quality voice, the network must be fine tuned end-to-end before implementing VoIP. This fine-tuning should incorporate a series of optimization techniques in order to improve the overall quality of service (QoS). Furthermore traffic shaping must be used to ensure VoIP reliability. There are two essential requirements to ensure VoIP quality: minimization of end-to-end delay and jitter. In this paper, the performance of QoS architecture was analyzed [...] The basic metrics that were evaluated are the end-to-end delay of voice packets across the access network and the bandwidth consumed by a voice call...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{support of}} <b>delay-sensitive</b> <b>applications</b> like VoIP, video conferencing, video streaming, etc. on {{scheduled}} mesh networks requires careful configuration of routing and schedul-ing. We formulate a delay-optimal joint routing and scheduling optimization problem that minimizes the maximum average delay perceived by any flow under the physical interference model. Due to the non-convex {{nature of this}} proposed problem, we cannot find the globally optimal joint routing and scheduling that minimizes the maximum per flow average delay. We overcome this issue by fixing the routing which makes the problem convex and then compute the optimal scheduling that results in minimum delay. We investigate several different routing strategies and compare the per flow average min-max delay when the scheduling is computed optimally. Based on these results, we provide engineering insights on configuring a wireless network for <b>delay-sensitive</b> <b>applications.</b> Index Terms—Wireless mesh networks, scheduling, delay, throughput, non-linear optimization.

40|$|Abstract In {{view that}} {{authentication}} {{has made a}} significant determinant in handover delay, this paper presents a fast authentication mechanism for mobile stations roaming within a WiMAX–WLAN interconnected environment. Incorporating a key reuse design that pre-vents repeated transactions at a remote server, our mechanism distributes security contexts ahead of handover to a local trusted key holder which manages several sites. A target site, upon receiving a mobile station, retrieves the contexts locally for authentication purpose and thus completes handover efficiently. While employing a target prediction algorithm as an option, our mechanism distributes the contexts to target candidates as dictated, which further improves handover performance if target prediction hits and maintains its advantage even in a miss. In addition, the handover optimization design specified in WiMAX is extended to support WiFi-to-WiMAX handovers. We reason that the proposed mechanism does not com-promise the system in any sense as well. Analytical and simulation results show that, despite key pre-distribution misses, our mechanism leads to marked improvement over counterpart schemes in terms of handover delay and packet loss, meeting <b>delay-sensitive</b> <b>application</b> requirements...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the wide}} {{utilization}} of cloud computing (e. g., services, applications, and resources), {{some of the}} services, applications, and smart devices {{are not able to}} fully benefit from this attractive cloud computing paradigm due to the following issues: (1) smart devices might be lacking in their capacity (e. g., processing, memory, storage, battery, and resource allocation), (2) they might be lacking in their network resources, and (3) the high network latency to centralized server in cloud might not be efficient for <b>delay-sensitive</b> <b>application,</b> services, and resource allocations requests. Fog computing is promising paradigm that can extend cloud resources to edge of network, solving the abovementioned issue. As a result, in this work, we propose an architecture of IoT service delegation and resource allocation based on collaboration between fog and cloud computing. We provide new algorithm that is decision rules of linearized decision tree based on three conditions (services size, completion time, and VMs capacity) for managing and delegating user request in order to balance workload. Moreover, we propose algorithm to allocate resources to meet service level agreement (SLA) and quality of services (QoS) as well as optimizing big data distribution in fog and cloud computing. Our simulation result shows that our proposed approach can efficiently balance workload, improve resource allocation efficiently, optimize big data distribution, and show better performance than other existing methods...|$|R

40|$|Popular {{anonymity}} protocols such as Tor provide low communication latency but {{are vulnerable}} to traffic-analysis attacks that can de-anonymize users. Traffic-analysis resistant protocols typically do not achieve low-latency communication (e. g., Dissent, Riffle), or are restricted to {{a specific type of}} traffic (e. g., Herd, Aqua). In this paper, we present PriFi, the first practical protocol for anonymous communication in local-area networks that is provably secure against traffic-analysis attacks, has a low communication latency, and is traffic agnostic. PriFi is based on Dining Cryptographer's networks}, and uses a 3 -layer architecture which removes the usual anonymization bottleneck seen in mix networks: packets sent by the clients follow their usual path, without any additional hop that would add latency. As a second contribution, we propose a novel technique for protecting against equivocation attacks, in which a malicious relay de-anonymizes clients by sending them different information. In PriFi's architecture, this is achieved without adding extra latency; in particular, clients do not need to gossip or run consensus among themselves. Finally, we describe a technique for detecting disruption (jamming) attacks by malicious clients and a blaming mechanism to enforce accountability against such attacks. We have fully implemented PriFi and evaluated its performance with well-known datasets. Our analysis is twofold: first, we show that our architecture tolerates well client churn; second, we show that the system can be used in practice with minimal latency overhead (e. g., 70 ms for 50 clients), and is compatible with <b>delay-sensitive</b> <b>application</b> such as VoIP.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} addresses some of {{the most}} important issues in delay-sensitive communication over wireless systems and networks. Traditionally, the design of communication networks adopts a layered framework where each layer serves as a ?black box? abstraction for higher layers. However, in the context of wireless networks with <b>delay-sensitive</b> <b>applications</b> such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), on-line gaming, and video conferencing, this layered architecture does not offer a complete picture. For example, an information theoretic perspective on the physical layer typically ignores the bursty nature of practical sources and often overlooks the role of delay in service quality. The purpose of this dissertation is to take on a cross-disciplinary approach to derive new fundamental limits on the performance, in terms of capacity and delay, of wireless systems and to apply these limits to the design of practical wireless systems that support <b>delay-sensitive</b> <b>applications.</b> To realize this goal, we consider a number of objectives. 1. Develop an integrated methodology for the analysis of wireless systems that support <b>delay-sensitive</b> <b>applications</b> based, in part, on large deviation theory. 2. Use this methodology to identify fundamental performance limits and to design systems which allocate resources efficiently under stringent service requirements. 3. Analyze the performance of wireless communication networks that takes advantage of novel paradigms such as user cooperation, and multi-antenna systems. Based on the proposed framework, we find that delay constraints significantly influence how system resources should be allocated. Channel correlation has a major impact on the performance of wireless communication systems.
