50|$|Thomas Aquinas, like Maimonides, {{argued against}} both the {{conservative}} theologians and the Averroists, claiming {{that neither the}} eternity nor the finite nature of the world could be proved by logical argument alone. According to Aquinas the possible eternity {{of the world and}} its creation would be contradictory if an efficient cause were precede <b>its</b> <b>effect</b> in duration or if non-existence precedes existence in duration. But an efficient cause, such as God, which instantaneously produces <b>its</b> <b>effect</b> would not necessarily precede <b>its</b> <b>effect</b> in duration. God can also be distinguished from a natural cause which produces <b>its</b> <b>effect</b> by motion, for a cause that produces motion must precede <b>its</b> <b>effect.</b> God could be an instantaneous and motionless creator, and could have created the world without preceding it in time. To Aquinas, that the world began was an article of faith.|$|R
