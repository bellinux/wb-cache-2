The <b>difficulties</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> image method were firmly {{put in the}} past, and even the need for prototypes became largely superfluous. Furthermore, the advent of active filters eased the computation difficulty because sections could be isolated and iterative processes were not then generally necessary.|$|E
5|$|After {{its season}} in London the company {{performed}} in Vienna, Budapest, Prague and Berlin. The tour was successful, artistically and financially, {{but was not}} without untoward incident. A planned visit to St Petersburg had to be cancelled because the Narodny Dom theatre burned down, and in Vienna the Philharmonic was unequal to the <b>difficulties</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> score of Petrushka. The illustrious orchestra revolted at the rehearsal for the first performance, refusing to play for Monteux; only an intervention by Diaghilev restored the rehearsal, {{by the end of}} which Monteux was applauded and Stravinsky given an ovation. In the middle of the tour Monteux was briefly summoned back to Paris by the Concerts Colonne, which had the contractual right to recall him, to deputise for Pierné; his own deputy, Désiré-Émile Inghelbrecht, took temporary musical charge of the Ballets Russes.|$|E
5|$|Colin Renfrew {{has pointed}} out the dangers of {{applying}} modern values of art to past societies and cultures. Günter Berghaus argues that these works have often been approached {{with a set of}} post-Renaissance aesthetic values that distinguish between artists and craftsman and art and artifact, although these categories are not universal and may be inappropriate for understanding prehistoric society. Duncan Garrow has pointed to the <b>difficulties</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modern distinction drawn between form and decoration. The emphasis in studies of prehistoric art tend to be placed on decoration in objects such as ceramics and ignores the importance of form, found in objects such as weapons.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: <b>The</b> impact <b>of</b> {{preoperative}} endoscopic therapy on <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> laparoscopic Heller myotomy and <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> myotomy {{on long-term}} outcome {{has not been}} determined. This study was undertaken to determine whether preoperative therapy impacts <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> laparoscopic Heller myotomy and whether preoperative therapy or <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> myotomy impacts long-term outcomes. Methods: Since 1992, 305 patients, 56 % male, median age 49 years, underwent laparoscopic Heller myotomy and were prospectively followed. <b>The</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> laparoscopic Heller myotomy was scored by the operating surgeon for the most recent 170 consecutive patients {{on a scale of}} 1 (easiest) to 5 (most difficult). Patients scored their symptoms before and after myotomy using a Likert scale from 0 (never/not bothersome) to 10 (always/very bothersome). Results: Before myotomy, 66 % of patients underwent endoscopic therapy: 33 % dilation, 11 % Botox, and 22 % both. Preoperative endoscopic therapy did not correlate with <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> myotomy (P�NS). Median follow-up was 25 months. Regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> myotomy, dysphagia improved with myotomy (P� 0. 0001). By regression analysis, the frequency and severity of postmyotomy dysphagia correlated with neither preoperative endoscopic therapy nor <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> myotomy...|$|R
5|$|Officially, {{the only}} {{acceptable}} religious doctrines in Prague were Catholic and Utraquist, but Kepler's {{position in the}} imperial court allowed him to practice his Lutheran faith unhindered. The emperor nominally provided an ample income for his family, but the <b>difficulties</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> over-extended imperial treasury meant that actually getting hold of enough money to meet financial obligations was a continual struggle. Partly because of financial troubles, his life at home with Barbara was unpleasant, marred with bickering and bouts of sickness. Court life, however, brought Kepler into contact with other prominent scholars (Johannes Matthäus Wackher von Wackhenfels, Jost Bürgi, David Fabricius, Martin Bachazek, and Johannes Brengger, among others) and astronomical work proceeded rapidly.|$|E
5|$|Social {{commentary}} was {{a feature}} of Chaplin's films from early in his career, as he portrayed the underdog in a sympathetic light and highlighted the <b>difficulties</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poor. Later, as he developed {{a keen interest in}} economics and felt obliged to publicise his views, Chaplin began incorporating overtly political messages into his films. Modern Times (1936) depicted factory workers in dismal conditions, The Great Dictator (1940) parodied Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini and ended in a speech against nationalism, Monsieur Verdoux (1947) criticised war and capitalism, and A King in New York (1957) attacked McCarthyism.|$|E

It was therefore expected that the climbers would need to attack early in the race, in order to build up a significant lead ahead of the lengthy time trial on Stage 17. The race organisers also hoped to encourage sprinters to take part by including seven fairly flat stages.|$|E

These experiments show that <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> environment {{does have an}} impact on <b>the</b> evolvability <b>of</b> effective team behaviours; i. e. simpler environments are more conducive to <b>the</b> evolution <b>of</b> effective team behaviours than more difficult environments. ...|$|R
5|$|The Pictish {{relationship}} with Rome {{appears to have}} been less overtly hostile than their Caledonian predecessors, at least in the beginning. There were no more pitched battles and conflict was generally limited to raiding parties {{from both sides of the}} frontier until immediately prior to and after the Roman retreat from Britannia. Their apparent success in holding back Roman forces cannot be explained solely with reference to the remoteness of Caledonia or the <b>difficulties</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> terrain. In part it may have been due to the difficulties encountered in subjugating a population that did not conform to the strictures of local governance that Roman power usually depended on to operate through.|$|E
5|$|Laffoon's {{administration}} {{was confronted by}} the economic <b>difficulties</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Depression. While he proposed a number of improvements, money was not available in the state budget to implement his plans. In his first full year in office, he cut $11.5 million from the state budget, but it remained out-of-balance. The state issued additional interest-bearing warrants to cover its debts. In 1931, these warrants accounted for 24.2 percent of the state's receipts; by 1932, that number had climbed to 40.2 percent. In order to raise more funds, Laffoon proposed a 2 percent state sales tax in 1932. The proposal was extremely unpopular with merchants and private citizens, and it showed little promise of passing in the General Assembly. On March 2, 1932, a mob of 100 anti-tax protesters stormed the governor's mansion, damaging some items inside. In {{an attempt to get}} the tax passed, Laffoon agreed to seek only a 1 percent tax. The proposal passed the House, but a Senate committee refused to report it to the full chamber for a vote.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Willie and Martin {{companies}} were {{running out of}} food and encountering bitterly cold temperatures. On October 19 a blizzard struck the region, halting the two companies and the relief party. The Willie Company was along the Sweetwater River approaching the Continental Divide. A scouting party sent ahead by the main rescue party found and greeted the emigrants, gave them {{a small amount of}} flour, encouraged them that rescue was near, and then rushed onward to try to locate the Martin Company. The members of the Willie Company had just reached the end of their flour supplies. They began slaughtering the handful of broken-down cattle that still remained while their death toll mounted. On October 20 Captain Willie and Joseph Elder went ahead by mule through the snow to locate the supply train and inform them of the company's desperate situation. They arrived at the rescue party's campsite near South Pass that evening, and by the next evening the rescue party reached the Willie Company and provided them with food and assistance. Half of the rescue party remained to assist the Willie Company while the other half pressed forward to assist the Martin Company. The <b>difficulties</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Willie Company were not yet over. On October 23, the second day after the main rescue party had arrived, the Willie Company faced the most difficult section of the trail—the ascent up Rocky Ridge. The climb took place during a howling snowstorm through knee-deep snow. That night 13 emigrants died.|$|E

5|$|Richard {{gradually}} re-established royal {{authority in}} the months after the deliberations of the Merciless Parliament. The aggressive foreign policy of the Lords Appellant failed when their efforts to build a wide, anti-French coalition came to nothing, and the north of England fell victim to a Scottish incursion. Richard was now over twenty-one years old and could with confidence claim the right to govern in his own name. Furthermore, John of Gaunt returned to England in 1389 and settled his differences with the king, after which the old statesman acted as a moderating influence on English politics. Richard assumed full control of the government on 3 May 1389, claiming that the <b>difficulties</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past years had been due solely to bad councillors. He outlined a foreign policy that reversed the actions of the appellants by seeking peace and reconciliation with France, and promised to lessen the burden of taxation on the people significantly. Richard ruled peacefully for the next eight years, having reconciled with his former adversaries. Still, later events would show that he had not forgotten the indignities he perceived. In particular, the execution of his former teacher Sir Simon de Burley was an insult not easily forgotten.|$|E
5|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the internal <b>difficulties</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Umayyad Caliphate that resulted from the civil wars of the 740s and the subsequent Abbasid Revolution, the Byzantines under Emperor Constantine V (reigned 741–775) were able to regain the initiative on their eastern borders from the Arabs, and pursued an aggressive strategy. With the gradual consolidation of the Abbasid regime in the 760s and 770s, the situation became more balanced: the Arabs resumed their large-scale raids deep into Asia Minor, although the Byzantines were still capable of major counterstrikes. Thus in 778, the Byzantines, under Michael Lachanodrakon, seized the town of Germanikeia (Ma'rash), where they captured significant amounts of booty and took many Syrian Christians captive, and defeated an army sent against them by the Abbasid general Thumama ibn al-Walid. In the next year, the Byzantines took and razed the fortress city of Hadath, forcing Caliph al-Mahdi (r. 775–785) to replace the rather passive Thumama with the veteran al-Hasan ibn Qahtaba. Hasan led over 30,000 troops in an invasion of Byzantine territory, but the Byzantines offered no opposition and withdrew to well-fortified towns and refuges, until a lack of supplies forced Hasan to return home without achieving much.|$|E
5|$|The American {{official}} most {{associated with}} the conflict in Laos was Ambassador William H. Sullivan, who served from December 1964 until June 1969. He {{was also one of}} the most controversial. Considered brilliant by most and tyrannical by many, Sullivan was despised by the American high command (both Army and Air Force) in Saigon, Sullivan's demand that he alone maintain complete control over every aspect of American military operations in Laos and the stringent restrictions that he imposed upon those operations, earned him few friends among the military. Few of his detractors, however, considered the <b>difficulties</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ambassador's position. He had to balance the competing interests of the CIA, the Seventh Air Force, MACV, and the Thais, and this had to be done without alienating Souvanna Phouma, an ally in all but name who acquiesced to almost every U.S. action within his country, short of outright invasion.|$|E

5|$|Victory in the Franco-Prussian War {{proved the}} {{capstone}} of the nationalist issue. In {{the first half}} of the 1860s, Austria and Prussia both contended to speak for the German states; both maintained they could support German interests abroad and protect German interests at home. In responding to the Schleswig-Holstein Question, they both proved equally diligent in doing so. After the victory over Austria in 1866, Prussia began internally asserting its authority to speak for the German states and defend German interests, while Austria began directing more and more of its attention to possessions in the Balkans. The victory over France in 1871 expanded Prussian hegemony in the German states to the international level. With the proclamation of Wilhelm as Kaiser, Prussia assumed the leadership of the new empire. The southern states became officially incorporated into a unified Germany at the Treaty of Versailles of 1871 (signed 26 February 1871; later ratified in the Treaty of Frankfurt of 10 May 1871), which formally ended the war. Although Bismarck had led the transformation of Germany from a loose confederation into a federal nation state, he had not done it alone. Unification was achieved by building on a tradition of legal collaboration under the Holy Roman Empire and economic collaboration through the Zollverein. The <b>difficulties</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vormärz, the impact of the 1848 liberals, the importance of von Roon's military reorganization, and von Moltke's strategic brilliance all played a part in political unification.|$|E
