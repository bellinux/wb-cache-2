40|$|Abstract. One of {{the main}} {{problems}} {{in the treatment of}} textile dyeing wastewater and dye manufacture wastewater is the removal of the <b>dye</b> <b>colour.</b> The colour of wastewater from today’s new cationic dyes for polyacrylic fibres is much more difficult to treat by physical techniques such as adsorption and chemical coagulation to archive complete decolourization, because these dyes are very highly soluble in water. The aim of the present work is to study the factors affecting the rate of decolourization of a textile wastewater witch contain water-soluble green cationic dyes derivatives of compact condensed system 2 -aminopyridine. The investigated organic dyes have been treated by advanced oxidative process (AOPs). The following AOPs have been studied: Fe 2 + /H 2 O 2, O 3 and O 3 /H 2 O 2. The chemical treatability of cationic dyes from wastewater resulted from dyeing process by single ozonation and ozonation enhanced by ferrous iron salt (FeSO 4 · 7 H 2 O) has been reported. The investigated processes followed the model of pseudo-first order reaction kinetic. Also, the VIS and HPLC methods were used, to demonstrate the degradation process of green cationic dyes derivatives from 2 -aminothiazolo [4, 5 -b] pyridine...|$|E

After vigorous treatment with toluene, 4 commercial dyes yelded mutagenic extracts on Salmonella typhimurium {{in the presence of}} microsomal enzymes. Only in one case were the responsible chemicals identified as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The low bioavailability of mutagens contained in carbon black and their low mutagenic activity suggest that the risk {{associated with the use of}} these dyes is probably negligible. Soxhlet extracts with ethanol from finished leather were mutagenic on strain TA 98 of Salmonella typhimurium in the absence of S 9 mix. Analysis of extracts of leather samples at various intermediate stages of processing showed that mutagenic activity was detectable after the colouring process. The responsible compound was identified as a nitroazo <b>dye</b> (<b>Colour</b> Index: Acid Brown 83), with a mutagenic potential of about 4 revertant/micrograms. Eighteen commercial tannins containing mainly Cr(III) sulphates were assessed for genotoxicity.

40|$|Abstract. A {{simple and}} {{sensitive}} spectrophotometric method for {{the determination of}} nitrogen dioxide in air and nitrite in water, soil, some analytical grade chemicals and tooth paste has been developed. Nitrogen dioxide in air is fixed as nitrite ion in alka-line sodium arsenite or triethanolamine absorber solution. The method {{is based on the}} reaction of nitrite in aqueous medium with known excess of Neutral Red (C. I. 50040), an azine dye having a primary amino group with absorption maxima at 530 nm. In acid medium, it showed a decrease in colour intensity due to diazotization, followed by deamination. Addition of bromide ion enhances the rate of diazotization, and the reaction goes to completion almost instantaneously. Beer’s law is obeyed over the range 0 – 20 µg nitrite and the molar absorptivity is 2. 5 · 104 L mol– 1 cm– 1. The colour system is stable for 2 days. The dye can be extracted under alkaline condition in iso-amyl alcohol and the addition of methanolic sulphuric acid restores the <b>dye</b> <b>colour.</b> It showed molar absorptivity of 4. 3 · 104 L mol– 1 cm– 1.

Azure C, basic fuchsin, and particularly pyronine G are relatively harmless, but produce no vital staining.

40|$|There {{are three}} {{dominant}} contributing factors that distort short tandem repeat profile measurements, two of which, stutter and {{variations in the}} allelic peak heights, have been described extensively. Here we characterise the remaining component, baseline noise. A probabilistic characterisation of the non-allelic noise peaks is not only inherently useful for statistical inference but is also significant for establishing a detection threshold. We do this by analysing the data from 643 single person profiles for the Identifiler Plus kit and 303 for the PowerPlex 16 HS kit. This investigation reveals that although the <b>dye</b> <b>colour</b> is a significant factor, it {{is not sufficient to}} have a per-dye colour description of the noise. Furthermore, we show that at a per-locus basis, out of the Gaussian, log-normal, and gamma distribution classes, baseline noise is best described by log-normal distributions and provide a methodology for setting an analytical threshold based on that deduction. In the PowerPlex 16 HS kit, we observe evidence of significant stutter at two repeat units shorter than the allelic peak, which has implications for the definition of baseline noise and signal interpretation. In general, the DNA input mass has an influence on the noise distribution. Thus, it is advisable to study noise and, consequently, to infer quantities like the analytical threshold from data with a DNA input mass comparable to the DNA input mass of the samples to be analysed...|$|E

The efficiencies of different types of nanocrystalline semiconductors were investigated and compared with commercialised TiO 2 nanopowder. Generated hydrogen was chemically stored by use of a quinoid system, which seems to be useable for fuel cells. Solar light sensitive nanocomposites of CdSe/TiO 2 and CdSxSey/TiO 2 type were prepared and their good photocatalytic performance was demonstrated. In the visible range of 400 - 600 nm CdSxSey/TiO 2 composites show comparable good results as in the UV range, which is very promising for their use as solar light water splitters. The concept of sensitising TiO 2 with different kind of semiconductor nanoparticles, which is already known from quantum dot sensitised solar cells (QDSC), was demonstrated here for water splitting as well. Furthermore the kinetics of the storage reaction was investigated by UV-Vis spectroscopy and found to proceed via a consecutive reaction with an 1 : 1 charge transfer complex of quinone and hydroquinone as intermediate. The electron transfer process via a Fe 2 +/Fe 3 + redox couple was investigated by UV-Vis spectroscopy as well as by a dye reaction on the TiO 2 surface.

40|$|The concept {{presented}} in this paper is the utilisation of the natural flavonoids present in cotton as anchors to attach other phenolic compounds to the fiber surface. Laccase can catalyze the oxidation of flavonoids in solution producing quinones that can be further polymerised and grafted onto surface of the cotton providing yellow to brown colouration, depending on the external flavonoids used and on the reaction conditions. Factors such as temperature, time of reaction, pretreatment of cotton, mechanical agitation and the role of an organic solvent were studied in order to improve this laccase colouration reaction. After <b>dyeing,</b> <b>colour</b> measurements and fastness tests (washing, friction and weathering fastness) were performed.

40|$|Presence of {{huge amount}} of salts in the {{wastewater}} of textile dyeing industry {{is one of the}} major limiting factors in the development of an effective biotreatment system for the removal of dyes from textile effluents. Large number of textile industries are located on the coastal areas due to ease of transport to the various places in world and help in building nations economy, but on the contrary the effluents released from these industries are proving a great problem for the marine life. Therefore, industrial effluents containing dyes must be treated before their safe discharge into the environment. There are various physiochemical methods are conventionally used. These methods are effective but quite expensive leading to the production of solid sludge. Bacterial spp. capable of thriving under high salt conditions could be employed for the treatment of saline dye-contaminated textile wastewaters. Most of the Scientists used chemical coagulation, Flocculation and Precipitation techniques for the removal of dye colors from waste waters.

Appropriate American Type Culture Collection and other characterized strains served as controls. A total of 487 of the clinical strains were identified as C. albicans. The remainder were other Candida species and non-Candida yeasts. Clinical isolates and controls were grown on Sabouraud agar for 18 h at 30 °C and then transferred to YMAB. Plates were incubated for 12 to 18 h at 30 °C, and colonies were observed for yellow-green fluorescence under long-wave UV light (A 365). All control strains of C. albicans and Candida stellatoidea fluoresced, as did 480 of the 490 isolates designated as C. albicans (which included 3 strains of C. stellatoidea). Cells of C. albicans grown on YMAB produced germ tubes in serum. Only five of the other 1, 062 non-C. albicans yeasts fluoresced. The sensitivity and specificity were 98. 0 and 99. 5 %, respectively, with a predictive value of 99. 1 %.

40|$|OPAL A is paw paw pulp {{treated by}} a process {{involving}} heating and alkalinisation. OPALA can improve resolution of wounds that are resistant to standard care therapy (Mitchell, 2008), although the mechanism {{is yet to be}} determined. We hypothesised an anti-inflammatory response to OPALA, and examined this by testing its ability to inhibit 5 -lipoxygenase (5 -LOX), an enzyme involved in production of pro-inflammatory leukotrienes. 5 -LOX converts linoleic acid to a hydroperoxide, an oxidant in the oxidative coupling of 3 -methyl- 2 -benzothiazolinone and 3 -(dimethylamino) benzoic acid (Anthon & Barrett, 2001). In the presence of haemoglobin, this reaction produces an indamine dye where development of <b>dye</b> <b>colour</b> (A 598) is used as a measure of 5 -LOX activity. 5 -LOX (630 U/ml) was incubated in the absence (control) or presence of OPALA (7. 6 % solution) 1 linoleic acid (0. 38 mM). 5 -LOX activity was observed in controls, and almost abolished by OPALA. To examine the chemical profile of OPALA bioactivity, OPALA (7 ml) was freeze dried, added to silica gel (5 g pre-wet with ethyl acetate) in a column, and eluted sequentially using ethyl acetate, acetone, methanol, and water (40 ml each). Eluants were freeze-dried, reconstituted to 0. 5 ml in 0. 1 M phosphate buffer solution, and tested for inhibition of 5 -LOX. 5 -LOX activity was almost abolished by the methanol and water eluants but unaffected by the other eluants. There was no difference in potency of the methanol and water eluants for inhibition of 5 -LOX. In conclusion, OPALA has potential anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting 5 -LOX. Polar compounds in OPALA are mainly responsible for this effect. Mitchell, G. McArthur T, HollerbachK, Richardson M. (2008). AMWA conference abstract, Darwin Anthon & Barrett (2001). J Agric.
