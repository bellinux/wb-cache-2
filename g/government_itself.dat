5|$|Return to {{economic}} growth and improved structural deficits enabled Ireland and Portugal to exit their bailout programmes in July 2014. Greece and Cyprus both managed to partly regain market access in 2014. Spain never officially received a bailout programme. Its rescue package from the ESM was earmarked for a bank recapitalization fund and did not include financial support for the <b>government</b> <b>itself.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several factors {{prevented}} {{the company from}} going bankrupt that year. The Desjardins Group, which was Cirque du Soleil's financial institution at the time, covered about $200,000 of bad checks. Also, a financier named Daniel Lamarre, who worked {{for one of the}} largest public relations firms in Quebec, represented the company for free, knowing that they didn't have the money to pay his fee. The Quebec <b>government</b> <b>itself</b> also came through again, granting Laliberté enough money to stay solvent for another year.|$|E

5|$|Shortly thereafter, {{an update}} to the SEOC Act, the Child Protection Act of 1984, made {{it illegal to}} {{purchase}} pornographic materials depicting minors through the mail, or possess them, {{on the grounds that}} it encouraged child sexual abuse. While popular with voters, civil liberties advocates warned that the expanded scope of these laws could result in prosecutions of entirely innocent people who had little or nothing to do with the child-porn industry, such as parents taking photos or videos of their children in the nude. Nevertheless, investigators forged ahead and had, by the mid-1980s, shut down almost all domestic child-porn production. The <b>government</b> <b>itself</b> was thereafter the biggest marketer, in the form of materials it created to tempt buyers.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{assumption}} that man is a social animal, Saint-Just argues that in nature {{there is no need for}} contracts, legislation, or acts of force. These constructs only become necessary when a society is in need of moral regeneration and serve merely as unsatisfactory substitutes for the natural bonds of free people. Such constructs permit small groups to assume unwarranted powers which, according to Saint-Just, leads to corruption within society. Because a return to the natural state is impossible, Saint-Just argues for a government composed of the most educated members of society, who could be expected to share an understanding of the larger social good. Outside the <b>government</b> <b>itself,</b> Saint-Just asserts there must be full equality between all men, including equal security in material possessions and personal independence. Property must be protected by the state but, in order to secure universal independence, all citizens (including women) must own property.|$|E

25|$|The League {{prerogative}} {{under that}} convention to expel a League member {{found guilty of}} aggression {{was used by the}} League Assembly only once, against the Soviet <b>government</b> <b>itself,</b> on December 14, 1939, following the Soviet invasion of Finland.|$|E
25|$|The {{term was}} also used by the <b>government</b> <b>itself,</b> the press and colloquially to mean the {{executive}} branch alone, as the branch of the government was responsible for day-to-day governance of the nationwhen a Premier headed or formed a government.|$|E

25|$|Although {{ultimately}} {{only the}} Lebanese Islamists succeeded, other activities {{have had more}} long-term impact. The Ayatollah Khomeini's 1989 fatwa calling for the killing of Indian-born British citizen Salman Rushdie had international impact. The Islamic revolutionary <b>government</b> <b>itself</b> is credited with helping establish Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq.|$|E
25|$|Where {{legislative}} channels {{have been}} unresponsive, some citizens {{have turned to}} the courts to address social issues more quickly. For instance, in the 1990s, individuals, and eventually the <b>government</b> <b>itself,</b> sued tobacco companies over the health risks of cigarette smoking. The 1998 Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement provided states with long-term payments to cover medical costs to treat smoking-related illnesses.|$|E
25|$|While the Proletkult {{movement}} {{began as}} independent groups in Petrograd (October 1917) and Moscow (February 1918), {{it was not}} long before the group's patrons in the Soviet state intervened to help forge a national organization. The Soviet <b>government</b> <b>itself</b> moved from Petrograd to Moscow in March 1918 and the center of Proletkult's own organizational gravity shifted simultaneously.|$|E

25|$|On 15 July 2016, a coup d'état was {{attempted}} by the military, with aims {{to remove}} Erdoğan from government.

Reportedly, no government official was arrested or harmed, which among other factors raised the suspicion of a false flag event staged by the <b>government</b> <b>itself.</b>|$|E
25|$|In November 1989, the XIVth Congress of the Romanian Communist Party (PCR) saw Ceaușescu, then aged 71, re-elected {{for another}} five years {{as leader of the}} PCR.

The following month, Ceaușescu's <b>government</b> <b>itself</b> collapsed after a series of violent events in Timișoara and Bucharest.|$|E

Smaller Philadelphia shipyards like Neafie & Levy, however—mindful both of the rigorous conditions placed on Navy contracts, and of the recent example of an established shipyard bankrupted by such a contract—preferred other solutions.|$|E
25|$|Given {{his desire}} for peace with the Osage, Carondelet {{accepted}} Chouteau's proposal. According {{to the terms of}} the agreement between Chouteau and Carondelet, Chouteau received $2,000 annually to support twenty soldiers at the fort and a six-year monopoly on trade with the Osage, unless the Spanish <b>government</b> <b>itself</b> supplied the soldiers (in which case, Chouteau would receive the monopoly but no more).|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{within the}} Libyan <b>government</b> <b>itself,</b> an intense power {{struggle}} has emerged between Maiteeq and Thinni for {{leadership of the}} Libyan government, including conflicting orders and statements.
