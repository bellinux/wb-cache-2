5|$|Upon Presidents {{return to}} port, the U.S. Navy {{launched}} {{an investigation into}} the incident. Gathering testimony from Presidents officers and crewmen, they determined that Little Belt <b>had</b> <b>fired</b> the first shot in the encounter. In the Royal Navy investigation, Captain Bingham insisted that President <b>had</b> <b>fired</b> the first shot and continued firing for 45 minutes, rather than the five minutes Rodgers claimed. In all subsequent reports, both captains continually insisted that the other ship <b>had</b> <b>fired</b> the first shot. Reaching a stalemate, the American and British governments quietly dropped the matter.|$|E
5|$|By 04:00 on 1June, the German fleet had evaded the British {{fleet and}} reached Horns Reef; the Germans then {{returned}} to port. In {{the course of the}} battle, Stettin had suffered eight men killed and another 28 wounded. She <b>had</b> <b>fired</b> a total of 81 rounds of ammunition from her 10.5cm guns.|$|E
5|$|Vice President Burr shot Hamilton, {{delivering}} what {{proved to}} be a fatal wound. Hamilton's shot broke a tree branch directly above Burr's head. Neither of the seconds, Pendleton nor Van Ness, could determine who fired first, as each claimed that the other man <b>had</b> <b>fired</b> first.|$|E
6000|$|He <b>has</b> <b>fired</b> once, he <b>has</b> <b>fired</b> twice, but the {{whistling}} ball went wide. [...] "Ye shoot like a soldier," [...] Kamal said. [...] "Show now if ye can ride." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the firefight, later {{ballistics}} reporting {{would show}} that nineteen rounds were fired in total. Art Roderick was shown to <b>have</b> <b>fired</b> one shot from an M16A1, Bill Degan fired seven rounds from an M-16 (while moving at least 21 feet m), Larry Cooper to <b>have</b> <b>fired</b> six rounds from a 9 mm Colt submachine gun, Sammy Weaver to <b>have</b> <b>fired</b> three rounds from a [...]223 Ruger Mini-14, and Kevin Harris fired two rounds from a [...]30-06 M1917 Enfield Rifle.|$|R
50|$|Kalle Kulbok, {{a member}} of Riigikogu during the time and {{a leader of the}} Independent Royalist Party of Estonia, has said that the {{military}} preparations were centered on containment rather than attack, and Estonian army would only <b>have</b> <b>fired</b> if the Jäägrikompanii would <b>have</b> <b>fired</b> first.|$|R
5|$|Defense {{accounts}} contradicted {{the testimony}} of Behan, Claiborne and Allen, who all said that a man <b>had</b> <b>fired</b> a nickel-plated pistol first. Claiborne and Allen both said it was Holliday. Virgil, Wyatt and other witnesses testified that Holliday was carrying a shotgun. (Morgan remained bedridden throughout the trial and did not testify.) The prosecution's scenario would have required Holliday to fire with his pistol first, switch to the shotgun to shoot Tom McLaury, then switch back again to his pistol to continue firing.|$|E
5|$|During the battle, Kaiser <b>had</b> <b>fired</b> 224 heavy {{battery and}} 41 {{secondary}} battery shells; Kaiserin fired 160 and 135 respectively, Prinzregent Luitpold fired 169 and 106 respectively, and Friedrich der Grosse fired 72 and 151 shells, respectively. Kaiser was hit twice by heavy-caliber shells during the battle, the only ship {{of the class}} to have been hit; however the ship only suffered a single wounded casualty.|$|E
5|$|During {{the final}} assault, C Company, located to the south, had {{uncovered}} a second bunker system which was subsequently {{captured by the}} Australians after being hastily abandoned. More than 16,000 rounds of M60 ammunition had been fired during the fighting, along with 6,000 rounds of M16 ammunition. The artillery <b>had</b> <b>fired</b> over 1,453 rounds of 105mm and 200 rounds of 155mm high explosive in support. Over the next six days Australian pioneer and engineer demolition teams proceeded to destroy the remaining bunkers.|$|E

5000|$|On Youre Fired, {{the panel}} agreed that, while they would <b>have</b> <b>fired</b> Sandeesh for both her weak efforts and for blaming Alex over the teams loss, Palomas {{outburst}} justified her firing. On Why I Fired Them, Sugar strongly indicated he would <b>have</b> <b>fired</b> Sandeesh, <b>had</b> {{it not been}} for Palomas last-minute outburst.|$|R

5|$|Having taken heavy {{casualties}} and losing strategic superiority, Burbridge {{and his men}} conducted a disorganized withdrawal. The Confederates had succeeded in holding the rail breastworks, yet had expended most of their ammunition in doing so. Each Confederate infantryman <b>had</b> <b>fired</b> at least seventy-five rounds, with some firing significantly more. The Union commanders then ordered another charge with a cavalry regiment that reinforced the Union infantry. The unexpected fighting capabilities of the small Confederate force had temporarily created a reprieve for the salt works.|$|E
5|$|Ike Clanton, who {{had been}} {{threatening}} to kill the Earps for several months, including the day before, and Billy Claiborne were both unarmed. They ran from the fight unhurt. Wesley Fuller, a Cowboy {{who had been}} {{at the rear of the}} lot, left as soon as the firing began. Both Wyatt and Virgil believed Tom McLaury was armed and testified that he <b>had</b> <b>fired</b> at least one shot over the back of a horse. Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury exchanged gunfire with the lawmen. During the gunfight, Doc Holliday was bruised by a bullet fired by Frank that struck his holster and grazed his hip. Virgil Earp was shot through the calf, he thought by Billy Clanton. Morgan Earp was struck across both shoulder blades by a bullet that Morgan thought Frank McLaury <b>had</b> <b>fired.</b> Wyatt Earp was unhurt. Tom McLaury, his brother Frank, and Billy Clanton were killed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of the battle, Kronprinz <b>had</b> <b>fired</b> 144 armor-piercing and semi-armor-piercing rounds from her main battery guns, though the exact numbers of each are unknown. The ship did not fire her {{secondary}} 15cm or 8.8cm guns during the entire engagement. Of the four König-class ships, only Kronprinz escaped damage during the battle.|$|E
50|$|While STAR Group {{officers}} rarely <b>have</b> to <b>fire</b> their weapon, {{there have}} been some incidents in which STAR group officers <b>have</b> <b>fired</b> upon an armed suspect and killed their target as per operation guidelines.|$|R

5|$|Sheriff Behan, testifying for the prosecution, {{said the}} Cowboys had not resisted, but had thrown {{up their hands}} and turned out their coats to show they were not armed. He said that Tom McLaury threw open his coat {{to show that he}} was not armed and that the first two shots were fired by the Earp party. Sheriff Behan insisted Doc Holliday <b>had</b> <b>fired</b> first using a {{nickel-plated}} revolver, although other witnesses reported seeing him carrying a messenger shotgun immediately beforehand.|$|E
5|$|With a {{total of}} ten people killed, it was the deadliest peacetime attack in Finnish history, surpassing the {{previous}} highest count of eight in the Jokela school shooting. It was the deadliest attack on a school campus since April 2007, when Seung-Hui Cho killed 32 people during the Virginia Tech shooting. Saari <b>had</b> <b>fired</b> {{a total of}} nearly 200 shots, including shots into the air. The highest number of shots inflicted to a single victim was twenty.|$|E
5|$|After {{a series}} of night engagements between the I Squadron battleships and British destroyers, the High Seas Fleet punched through the British light forces and reached Horns Reef by 04:00 on 1 June. The German fleet reached Wilhelmshaven a few hours later; five of the I Squadron battleships took up {{defensive}} positions in the outer roadstead, and Kaiser, Kaiserin, Prinzregent Luitpold, and Kronprinz stood ready just outside the entrance to Wilhelmshaven. The rest of the fleet entered Wilhelmshaven, where Friedrich der Grosse and the other ships still in fighting condition replenished their stocks of coal and ammunition. In {{the course of the}} battle, Friedrich der Grosse <b>had</b> <b>fired</b> 72 main battery shells and 151 rounds from her secondary guns. She emerged from the battle completely undamaged.|$|E

50|$|Since {{both the}} submachine gun and the pistol <b>had</b> been <b>fired</b> {{it is likely}} that more than one person fired the shots. However, only Peters was sentenced for the actual murders since he confessed to <b>have</b> <b>fired</b> all the shots.|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of battle damage and casualties, Langsdorff decided to put into Montevideo, where repairs could be {{effected}} and the wounded men could be evacuated from the ship. Most of the hits scored by the British cruisers caused only minor structural and superficial damage but the oil purification plant, which was required to prepare the diesel fuel for the engines, was destroyed. Her desalination plant and galley were also destroyed, which would have increased the difficulty {{of a return to}} Germany. A hit in the bow would also have negatively affected her seaworthiness in the heavy seas of the North Atlantic. Admiral Graf Spee <b>had</b> <b>fired</b> much of her ammunition in the engagement with Harwood's cruisers.|$|E
5|$|Darabont's {{departure}} as showrunner in July 2011 {{during the}} second season came as surprise to many, as it came shortly after the season's premiere {{and a few days}} after that year's Comic-Con, where Darabont helped to promote the show. It was speculated that he was unable to adjust to the schedule of running a television series. However, The Hollywood Reporter reported that AMC <b>had</b> <b>fired</b> him. There had been reported difficulties in the production of the second season, including disputes over planned budget cuts and executive meddling, and it was known that Darabont and AMC had several discussions relating to these factors. However, neither Darabont, AMC, nor the cast nor crew of The Walking Dead spoke about the reasons for his firing.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the ferocity}} of the night fighting, the High Seas Fleet punched through the British {{destroyer}} forces and reached Horns Reef by 04:00 on 1June. The German fleet reached Wilhelmshaven a few hours later, where Posen and several other battleships from the I Battle Squadron took up defensive positions in the outer roadstead. Over {{the course of the}} battle, the ship <b>had</b> <b>fired</b> fifty-three 28cm shells, sixty-four 15cm rounds, and thirty-two 8.8cm shells. The ship and her crew emerged from the battle completely unscathed by enemy fire.|$|E

25|$|The Hamlet plant <b>had</b> three {{previous}} <b>fires,</b> but no {{action was taken}} to prevent recurrence or to unlock the doors. The building <b>had</b> <b>fires</b> before Imperial took over as well, although these, too, were non-fatal. The Imperial plant at Cumming, Georgia, <b>had</b> two major <b>fires,</b> one of which, in 1989, caused $1.2 million worth of damage. The Hamlet plant <b>had</b> no <b>fire</b> alarm system to warn workers farther back in the plant, {{and there were no}} sprinklers in the building.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{the ferocity}} of the night fighting, the High Seas Fleet punched through the British {{destroyer}} forces and reached Horns Reef by 04:00 on 1June. The German fleet reached Wilhelmshaven a few hours later, where Rheinland refueled and re-armed. Meanwhile, her three sisters stood out in the roadstead in defensive positions. Over {{the course of the}} battle, the ship <b>had</b> <b>fired</b> thirty-five 28cm (11in) shells and twenty-six 15cm (5.9in) rounds. The two hits from Black Prince had killed 10 men and wounded 20. Repair work followed immediately in Wilhelmshaven and was completed by 10 June.|$|E
5|$|During {{the making}} of Greed, the {{production}} company merged into Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, putting Irving Thalberg {{in charge of the}} production. Thalberg <b>had</b> <b>fired</b> Stroheim a few years earlier at Universal Pictures. Originally almost eight hours long, Greed was edited against Stroheim's wishes to about two-and-a-half hours. Only twelve people saw the full-length 42-reel version, now lost; some of them called it the greatest film ever made. Stroheim later called Greed his most fully realized work and was hurt both professionally and personally by the studio's re-editing of it.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the return}} to German waters, Helgoland and Thüringen, along with the s , , and , took up {{defensive}} positions in the Jade roadstead for the night. During the battle, the ship suffered only minor damage; Helgoland {{was hit by a}} single 15-inch shell, but sustained minimal damage. Nevertheless, dry-docking was required to repair the hole in the belt armor. Work was completed by 16 June. In the course of the battle, Helgoland <b>had</b> <b>fired</b> 63 main battery shells, and 61 rounds from her 15cm guns.|$|E
