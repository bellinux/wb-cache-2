5|$|The act {{allowed an}} <b>injured</b> <b>party</b> {{to bring a}} claim outside the normal statute of {{limitations}} period if he could {{show that he was}} not aware of the injuries himself until after the limitation period had expired and if he gained the permission of the court. After a series of problems emerged, including vagueness on a point even the House of Lords was unable to clarify and poor draftsmanship, the Act was repealed bit by bit during the 1970s, with the Limitation Act 1980 scrapping the last remaining sections.|$|E
5|$|These {{provisions}} covered both Cartledge-like {{situations and}} {{cases where the}} <b>injured</b> <b>party,</b> while aware of his injuries, does not connect them to the true cause until {{more than three years}} after the injuries were sustained. The act had a limited retrospective effect - it covered injuries that had happened before the Act came into force if an action had not been brought. If a judgment had already been made in a case, the Act could not apply to it, meaning the Act actually had no effect on the Cartledge case itself.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the passing}} of the 1963 Act, the only {{exceptions}} to the normal statute of limitations (three years after the events that caused the injury, as established by the Law Reform (Limitation of Actions, etc.) Act 1954) were if the claim was being brought for a case of mistake or fraud, in which case the statute of limitations was twelve months from when the claimant could reasonably have been expected to discover the fraud or mistake. In Cartledge v E. Jopling & Sons Ltd the claimant sued Jopling after he developed pneumoconiosis from working in the company's poorly ventilated steel mills. The injuries were sustained in October 1950 but they were not discovered until 1956, and as a result the <b>injured</b> <b>party</b> had no cause of action. Because the injuries had not been discovered until six years after they were caused, and the statute of limitations was three years after the injury itself, Cartledge was not legally allowed to bring a case.|$|E

5|$|The case {{first went}} to the High Court of Justice, where it was heard by Fulford J; {{he decided that he}} did not have the {{authority}} to overrule Bonnard, and passed the case on to the Court of Appeal after granting a temporary injunction. In the Court of Appeal, the case was heard by May, Dyson and Brooke LJJ, with Brooke delivering the judgment on 5 November 2004. In it, Brooke judged that defamation, the subject of Greene, was significantly different from breach of confidentiality, the subject in Cream. While the damage from a breach of confidentiality can never be undone, justifiying a simple test for issuing injunctions, a defamation case that is won vindicates the <b>injured</b> <b>party.</b> Making it easier to grant injunctions in defamation cases would damage the delicate balance between freedom of the press and the right to privacy; as such, despite the Human Rights Act, Bonnard is still a valid test.|$|E

40|$|The {{motives for}} the {{development}} of mass tort claims resolution facilities are laudatory. The speakers at the conference that preceded the publication of this issue of Law and ContemporaryProblems noted the desire to settle claims quickly and fairly, and {{to increase the amount of}} awards by decreasing litigation costs. Although these motives seem strongly pro-client, it is striking that the <b>injured</b> <b>parties</b> themselves are not represented in this symposium, either directly or indirectly. They are not represented directly in that the authors are all attorneys who deal with mass torts. They are not represented indirectly in that no systematic evidence about the views of the <b>injured</b> <b>parties</b> themselves is introduced. Hence, we do not know what the <b>injured</b> <b>parties</b> want from the legal system, how they feel about traditional methods of handling their claims, and how they evaluate the new facilities that have been developed to deal with their grievances...|$|R
50|$|In 1911, a motor van {{belonging}} to the American Steam Laundry Company, Kilmarnock, while proceeding along the country road between Burnhouse and East Middleton on its way towards Lugton, through the steering gear going wrong, was overturned in a ditch. All 4 occupants were thrown out {{and two of them}} were seriously injured. Lord Eglinton was passing in his car at the time and had the <b>injured</b> <b>parties</b> taken to Beith in his car. The <b>injured</b> <b>parties</b> were treated for head and body injuries after which they were driven to Lugton and entrained for Kilmarnock.|$|R
25|$|There may be {{circumstances}} in which it would be unjust to permit the defaulting party simply to buy out the <b>injured</b> <b>party</b> with damages. For example, where an art collector purchases a rare painting and the vendor refuses to deliver, the collector's damages would be equal to the sum paid.|$|E
25|$|The {{person who}} commits {{the act is}} called a tortfeasor. Although crimes may be torts, the cause of legal action is not {{necessarily}} a crime, as the harm may be due to negligence which does not amount to criminal negligence. The victim of the harm can recover their loss as damages in a lawsuit. In order to prevail, the plaintiff in the lawsuit, commonly referred to as the <b>injured</b> <b>party,</b> must show that the actions or lack of action was the legally recognizable cause of the harm. The equivalent of tort in civil law jurisdictions is delict.|$|E
25|$|Prohibition of Third-party standing: A {{party may}} only assert {{his or her}} own rights and cannot raise the claims of a third party who is not before the court; {{exceptions}} exist where the third party has interchangeable economic interests with the <b>injured</b> <b>party,</b> or a person unprotected by a particular law sues to challenge the oversweeping of the law into the rights of others. For example, a party suing over a law prohibiting certain types of visual material, may sue because the 1st Amendment rights of theirs, and others engaged in similar displays, might be damaged.Additionally, third parties who do not have standing may be able to sue under the next friend doctrine if the third party is an infant, mentally handicapped, or not a party to a contract. One example of a statutory exception to the prohibition of third party standing exists in the qui tam provision of the Civil False Claims Act.|$|E
2500|$|Dutch {{law allows}} {{associations}} (verenigingen) and foundations (stichtingen) {{to bring a}} so-called collective action on behalf of other persons, provided they can represent the interests of such persons according to their by-laws (statuten) (section 3:305a Dutch Civil Code). All types of actions are permitted, excluding a claim for monetary damages. Most class actions {{over the past decade}} have been in the field of securities fraud and financial services. The acting association or foundation may come to a collective settlement with the defendant. The settlement may also include– and usually primarily consists of– monetary compensation of damages. Such settlement can be declared binding for all <b>injured</b> <b>parties</b> by the Amsterdam Court of Appeal (section 7:907 Dutch Civil Code). [...] The <b>injured</b> <b>parties</b> have an opt-out right during the opt-out period set by the Court, usually 3 to 6 months. Interestingly, settlements involving <b>injured</b> <b>parties</b> from outside The Netherlands can also be declared binding by the Court. Notably since US courts are reluctant to take up class actions brought on behalf of <b>injured</b> <b>parties</b> not residing in the US who have suffered damages due to acts or omissions committed outside the US, it may be interesting to combine a US class action and a Dutch collective action {{to be able to come}} to a settlement that covers plaintiffs worldwide. An example of this is the Royal Dutch Shell Oil Reserves Settlement that was declared binding upon both US and non-US plaintiffs.|$|R

25|$|The debtor {{shall be}} {{responsible}} for his acts, whether intentional or negligent. The extent of responsibility for one's negligence varies with the particular nature of the affair; but such responsibility shall be lessened, if the affair {{is not intended to}} procure interests to the debtor. If there is change of circumstances which is not predictable then after the constitution of the contract, and if the performance of the original obligation arising therefrom will become obviously unfair, the party may apply to the court for increasing or reducing his payment, or altering the original obligation. If according {{to the nature of the}} contract or the expression of intent of the parties, the purpose of the contract can not be accomplished if not performed within the fixed period, and if one of the parties does not perform the contract within that period, the other party may rescind the contract without giving the notice specified in the preceding article. Unless otherwise provided by the act or by the contract, a person who is bound to make compensation for an injury shall restore the <b>injured</b> <b>party</b> to the status quo before the injury. If the restoration of the status quo ante shall be paid in money, interest shall be added from the time of the injury.|$|E
500|$|Injury to {{the ears}} has been present since Roman {{times as a}} method of {{reprimand}} or punishment - [...] "In Roman times, when a dispute arose that could not be settled amicably, the <b>injured</b> <b>party</b> cited the name of the person thought to be responsible before the Praetor; if the offender did not appear within the specified time limit, the complainant summoned witnesses to make statements. [...] If they refused, as often happened, the <b>injured</b> <b>party</b> was allowed to drag them by the ear and to pinch them hard if they resisted. [...] Hence the French expression [...] "se faire tirer l’oreille", of which the literal meaning is [...] "to have one's ear pulled" [...] and the figurative meaning [...] "to take a lot of persuading". We use the expression [...] "to tweak [...] (or pull) someone's ears" [...] to mean [...] "inflict a punishment"." ...|$|E
500|$|Louise, Lorne, and two attendants, {{were hurt}} in a sleigh {{accident}} on 14 February 1880.

The horses then panicked, and dragged the overturned carriage over more than [...] of ground. Louise was knocked unconscious when she hit her head on the iron bar supporting the roof, and Lorne was trapped underneath her, expecting [...] "the sides of the carriage to give way at any moment". Eventually, as they overtook the sleigh ahead, the horses calmed, and the occupant of that sleigh, Princess Louise's aide-de-camp, ordered an empty carriage to convey the <b>injured</b> <b>party</b> back to Rideau Hall.|$|E

50|$|In the United States, the {{definition}} of an uninsured/underinsured motorist, and corresponding coverages, are set by state laws. In some states it is mandatory. In the case of underinsured coverage, two different triggers apply: a damages trigger {{which is based on}} whether the limits are insufficient to cover the <b>injured</b> <b>party's</b> damages, and a limits trigger which applies when the limits are less than the <b>injured</b> <b>party's</b> limits. According to a 2009 survey by trade association Property Casualty Insurers Association of America, 29 states have a limits trigger while 20 states have a damages trigger. Another variation is whether a particular state requires stacking of policy limits of different vehicles or policies.|$|R

500|$|The Limitation Act 1963 [...] (1963 c.47) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that {{amended the}} statute of {{limitations}} to allow actions in some cases where the <b>injured</b> <b>party</b> had not discovered the injury until after the standard date of expiration. The Act was based on the report of the Davies Committee on Limitation of Actions in Cases of Personal Injury, created after the Court of Appeal decision in the case of Cartledge v Jopling, and the Committee notably produced their final report before Cartledge had been heard in the House of Lords. The draft bill was presented to Parliament on 6 May 1963; it was given the Royal Assent on 31 July and came into force on the same day.|$|E
500|$|The Act created {{exceptions}} to the normal statute of limitations {{in addition to the}} previous ones of fraud and mistake. It introduced an exception if 1) the permission of the court had been gained to bring a case and 2) the [...] "material facts" [...] of the case included [...] "facts of a decisive character" [...] which the claimant was not aware of until after the expiry of the statute of limitations. Where these two requirements were fulfilled, a case could be brought {{as long as it was}} within twelve months of the claimant finding out the [...] "facts of a decisive character". The same principles applied if the <b>injured</b> <b>party</b> were dead and the claim was being brought on behalf of his estate or dependants. If leave was refused to open a case, the decision could be appealed up to the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, but no further.|$|E
500|$|Following Simpson's divorce {{hearing on}} 27 October 1936, her solicitor, John Theodore Goddard, became {{concerned}} {{that there would}} be a [...] "patriotic" [...] citizen's intervention (a legal device to block the divorce), and that such an intervention would be successful. The courts could not grant a collaborative divorce (a dissolution of marriage consented to by both parties), and so the case was being handled as if it were an undefended at-fault divorce brought against Ernest Simpson, with Wallis Simpson as the innocent, <b>injured</b> <b>party.</b> The divorce action would fail if the citizen's intervention showed that the Simpsons had colluded by, for example, conniving in or staging the appearance of his adultery so that she could marry someone else. On Monday 7 December 1936, the King heard that Goddard planned to fly to the south of France to see Wallis Simpson. The King summoned him and expressly forbade him to make the journey, fearing that the visit might put doubts in Simpson's mind. Goddard went straight to Downing Street to see Baldwin, as a result of which he was provided with an aeroplane to take him directly to Cannes.|$|E

2500|$|Adolph Esmit's long {{imprisonment}} both on St. Thomas and in Copenhagen in 1686 and 1687 {{had given}} him grounds for appearing as the <b>injured</b> <b>party,</b> and for demanding some form of restitution.
