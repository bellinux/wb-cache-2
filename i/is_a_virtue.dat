Meno proposes to Socrates that the [...] "capacity to govern men" [...] may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>virtue</b> common to all people.

The first sentence of his first chapter reads, “I set fire to my Bible on the playing fields of my Cambridge boarding school one bright, windy spring afternoon in 1967.” One senses the deep—and, in my view, healthy—feeling of self-disgust with which he wrote this, for indeed it describes an act of wickedness.

[...] The Church sees sex {{as more than a}} physical act; it also affects body and soul, so the Church teaches that chastity <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>virtue</b> all people are called to acquire. It is defined as the inner unity of a person's [...] "bodily and spiritual being" [...] that successfully integrates a person's sexuality with his or her [...] "entire human nature." [...] To acquire this virtue, followers are encouraged to enter into the [...] "long and exacting work" [...] of self-mastery that is helped by friendships, God's grace, maturity and education [...] "that respects the moral and spiritual dimensions of human life." [...] The Catechism categorizes violations of the sixth commandment into two categories: [...] "offenses against chastity" [...] and [...] "offenses against the dignity of marriage".|$|E

2500|$|Christianity, as a {{religion}} of peace, is despised by Nietzsche. According to Nietzsche's account, pity has a depressive effect, loss of vitality and strength, and is harmful to life. It also preserves that which should naturally be destroyed. For a noble morality, pity is a weakness, but for Christianity, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>virtue.</b> In Schopenhauer's philosophy, which Nietzsche {{sees as the}} most nihilistic and opposed to life, pity is the highest virtue of all. But, for Nietzsche, pity [...] "... multiplies misery and conserves all that is miserable, and is thus a prime instrument of the advancement of decadence: pity persuades men to nothingness! Of course, one does not say 'nothingness.' One says 'the Beyond' or 'God' or ' true life' or 'Nirvana,' 'salvation,' 'redemption,' 'blessedness.' ... Schopenhauer was hostile to life: therefore pity became a virtue for him." [...] The moderns Leo Tolstoy and Richard Wagner [...] adopted Schopenhauer's viewpoint. Aristotle, who lived in 384-322 BC, on the other hand, recognized the unhealthiness of pity and prescribed tragedy as a purgative.

2500|$|According to his essay, [...] "Practicing Patience: How Christians Should Be Sick", in Christians Among the Virtues, he {{said that}} Christians are called to be patient {{patients}} in sickness and in health because [...] "patience is integral to the Christian life". Patience cannot be first learned while being a patient. To learn patience, Christians are to exercise the virtue through deeds, truth, practice, and living it. Hauerwas also says that patience <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>virtue</b> {{we have in common}} with God. [...] "In Him, patience has its beginning, and from Him as its source it takes its splendor and dignity." [...] He also says that God showed us the best example of patience {{when it comes to the}} life of Jesus. Because God is the foundation, Hauerwas stated that “only patience shaped by Christ is true patience". As well as this, he later emphasized that patience is not developed by human will, but given through the Holy Spirit, who gives us the capacity to love, for “without [...] in us there cannot be patience because in good men it is the [...] of God which endures all things.” In the author’s essay, he gave people a framework of how to learn to practice patience when we are not sick: ...|$|E
2500|$|Controversy {{has arisen}} over {{which of the}} {{alternative}} formulations of the test Turing intended. Sterrett argues that two distinct tests can be extracted from his 1950 paper and that, pace Turing's remark, they are not equivalent. The test that employs the party game and compares frequencies of success {{is referred to as}} the [...] "Original Imitation Game Test," [...] whereas the test consisting of a human judge conversing with a human and a machine {{is referred to as the}} [...] "Standard Turing Test," [...] noting that Sterrett equates this with the [...] "standard interpretation" [...] rather than the second version of the imitation game. Sterrett agrees that the Standard Turing Test (STT) has the problems that its critics cite but feels that, in contrast, the Original Imitation Game Test (OIG Test) so defined is immune to many of them, due to a crucial difference: Unlike the STT, it does not make similarity to human performance the criterion, even though it employs human performance in setting a criterion for machine intelligence. A man can fail the OIG Test, but it is argued that it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>virtue</b> of a test of intelligence that failure indicates a lack of resourcefulness: The OIG Test requires the resourcefulness associated with intelligence and not merely [...] "simulation of human conversational behaviour." [...] The general structure of the OIG Test could even be used with non-verbal versions of imitation games.|$|E
