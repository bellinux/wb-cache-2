5|$|Following the {{collapse}} of the Whig Party in the early 1850s, many former Whigs joined the Know Nothing, or American, Party, and Charles S. Morehead was elected governor from that party in 1855. Sectarian tensions gripped the state in the lead-up to the Civil War, and while the majority of Kentuckians favored the preservation of the Union above all <b>else,</b> <b>a</b> self-constituted group of Confederate sympathizers met at Russellville and formed a Confederate government for the state. While this provisional government never displaced the elected government in Frankfort, two men served as Confederate governors of Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|Yoshikawa {{develops}} {{misgivings about}} Asami after {{he is unable}} to reach any of the references on her résumé, such as a music producer she claimed to work for, who is missing. However, Aoyama is so enthralled by her that he pursues her anyway. She lives in an empty apartment, containing a sack and a phone. For four days after the audition, she sits perfectly still next to the phone waiting for it to ring. When it finally does, she answers pretending that she never expected Aoyama to call. After several dates, she agrees to accompany him to a seaside hotel, where a smitten Aoyama intends to propose marriage. At the hotel, Asami reveals burn scars on her body. Before making love, Asami demands that Aoyama pledge his love to her and no one <b>else.</b> <b>A</b> deeply moved Aoyama agrees. In the morning, Asami is nowhere to be found.|$|E

25|$|As a {{religious}} concept, {{it is used}} in two distinct respects: {{a belief in the}} resurrection of individual souls that is current and ongoing (Christian idealism, realized eschatology), or <b>else</b> <b>a</b> belief in a singular resurrection of the dead {{at the end of the}} world.

25|$|A pointed pseudotriangulation can {{be defined}} as a finite non-crossing {{collection}} of line segments, such that at each vertex the incident line segments span an angle of at most π, and such that no line segments can be added between any two existing vertices while preserving this property. It is not hard to see that a pointed pseudotriangulation is a pseudotriangulation of its convex hull: all convex hull edges may be added while preserving the angle-spanning property, and all interior faces must be pseudotriangles <b>else</b> <b>a</b> bitangent line segment could be added between two vertices of the face.|$|E
25|$|In {{nuclear physics}} and nuclear chemistry, a nuclear {{reaction}} is semantically {{considered to be}} the process in which two nuclei, or <b>else</b> <b>a</b> nucleus of an atom and a subatomic particle (such as a proton, neutron, or high energy electron) from outside the atom, collide to produce one or more nuclides that are different from the nuclide(s) that began the process. Thus, a nuclear reaction must cause a transformation of at least one nuclide to another. If a nucleus interacts with another nucleus or particle and they then separate without changing the nature of any nuclide, the process is simply referred to as a type of nuclear scattering, rather than a nuclear reaction.|$|E
25|$|No cricket {{had been}} {{reported}} in the infant newspaper industry before 1697 due to the Licensing of the Press Act 1662 which controlled the press until 1696, but reports were beginning to increase by the mid-1720s, though {{it would be a very}} long time indeed before coverage became anything like comprehensive. Early reports tended to be an advertisement for a scheduled match or <b>else</b> <b>a</b> brief discussion of the gambling odds rather than the actual play and it was not until 1726 that players were first mentioned by name in a newspaper report. Match reports were much more common in the 1730s and were beginning to present increased detail, sometimes including the names of patrons and players. There is, therefore, a considerably larger record of the 1730s than of the previous decades.|$|E

He participated in psychosocial {{experiment}} SFINCSS-99 (Simulation of Flight of International Crew on Space Station), which examined inter-cultural and other stress factors affecting integration of crew {{in preparation for the}} ISS spaceflights. Scott Kelly has spent the most time in space of any American. Kelly returned from the ISS on 1 March 2016 having spent 340 consecutive days in orbit.|$|E
25|$|The name of {{the file}} system {{originates}} from the file system's prominent usage of an index table, the File Allocation Table, statically allocated {{at the time of}} formatting. The table contains entries for each cluster, a contiguous area of disk storage. Each entry contains either the number of the next cluster in the file, or <b>else</b> <b>a</b> marker indicating end of file, unused disk space, or special reserved areas of the disk. The root directory of the disk contains the number of the first cluster of each file in that directory; the operating system can then traverse the FAT table, looking up the cluster number of each successive part of the disk file as a cluster chain {{until the end of the}} file is reached. In much the same way, sub-directories are implemented as special files containing the directory entries of their respective files.|$|E
25|$|The {{deployment}} failure {{added to}} {{doubts about the}} lack of lorries and transport aircraft and British domination of the terrain, which led to another change of plan. The fourth plan was for 13 September, with Sidi Barrani and the area to the south as the objective. The 10th Army, with five divisions and the tanks, would advance in mass down the coast road, occupy Sollum and advance to Sidi Barrani, through Buq Buq. Having reached Sidi Barrani, the army was to consolidate and bring up supplies, destroy a British counter-attack and resume the advance to Matruh. The Italian non-motorized infantry divisions were to use the coast road, because these divisions would be ineffective anywhere <b>else.</b> <b>A</b> similar operation had been conducted on the northern front in Ethiopia but went against theory, for which there were ample forces to execute. Graziani believed the only way to defeat the British was by mass, having overestimated their strength.|$|E

25|$|Prairie Style {{architecture}} {{was primarily}} originated by Frank Lloyd Wright, {{inspired by the}} ideas of Louis Sullivan, who served as mentor to Wright, Steele, and many other practitioners of the Prairie School. As developed by Wright, George Grant Elmslie, William Gray Purcell, Marion Mahony, Walter Burley Griffin, and others, the Prairie School of architecture rejected historical revival styles and {{was inspired by the}} flat terrain and horizon of the prairies of the Midwest. Prairie Style features crisp, rectilinear geometries with an emphasis on horizontal lines set off by occasional vertical counterpoints. Ornament should develop from the structure itself or express it rather than being added to it as an embellishment, and the architect should rely on construction materials honestly used as themselves, rather than imitating something <b>else.</b> <b>A</b> building’s internal structure should determine its exterior and be clearly expressed on the outside, in keeping with Sullivan’s famous motto of “form follows function”.|$|E
