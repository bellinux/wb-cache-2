Subsequently, in 1988, MIM tested the flotation of a stream of fine lead-bearing particles in a conventional mechanical <b>flotation</b> <b>cell,</b> a conventional column and the Jameson Cell. The Cell gave the best recoveries. This {{was thought to be}} a combination of the short residence time of the particles in the Cell {{and the fact that the}} hydrophobicity of the lead particles decreased over time.|$|E
2500|$|Froth {{flotation}} {{is achieved}} by mixing chemicals known as collectors with the ore slurry. The collectors adsorb onto the surfaces of the particles of select minerals (usually the valuable mineral that is targeted for concentration), making these minerals hydrophobic. Air is passed through the slurry in a tank known as a <b>flotation</b> <b>cell.</b> The air is broken into tiny bubbles by various mechanisms (depending {{on the design of}} the <b>flotation</b> <b>cell),</b> and the now-hydrophobic minerals attach to the bubbles, rising with them {{to the surface of the}} <b>flotation</b> <b>cell,</b> where they form a froth. The froth flows over the top edge (or [...] "lip") of the <b>flotation</b> <b>cell</b> and forms the flotation concentrate. Ideally, none of the unwanted mineral particles float, and they remain behind as the flotation tailings.|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to most types of <b>flotation</b> <b>cell,</b> the Cell introduces the feed {{and the air}} to the Cell in a combined stream via one or more cylindrical columns referred to as [...] "downcomers".

40|$|Flotation is a {{difficult}} process to run efficiently. One way to make flotation performance better is to improve cell level control. However, controlling pulp levels in <b>flotation</b> <b>cells</b> is a complex control task because of strong interactions between the levels in <b>flotation</b> <b>cells.</b> Therefore advanced controllers are needed to give good level control. This paper deals with a model of six <b>flotation</b> <b>cells</b> in series. Simulations are performed to compare different control strategies. Four control strategies are considered: one SISO controller and three different MIMO controllers including a new multivariable controller.

A conventional <b>flotation</b> <b>cell</b> has problems with recovering fine particles at high grades {{due to the}} entrainment of gangue minerals in the froth.

2500|$|Subsequently, an {{internal}} recycling system, {{referred to as}} the [...] "internal recycle control" [...] or [...] "IRC" [...] was developed. This was mainly used in integrated rectangular cells (see Figure 6), where the feed tank and tailings recycling system could easily be built in a single unit with the <b>flotation</b> <b>cell.</b> This system reduced the cell installation costs and made the cell more compact.|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{problems}} encountered with the Mark I Cell was that its performance was reduced if the feed rate to the cell varied, which was a common occurrence arising from normal fluctuations in operating concentrators. This problem was resolved by recycling some of the tailings to the cell feed via an external splitter box called an [...] "External Recycle Mechanism" [...] or [...] "ERM" [...] box separate to the <b>flotation</b> <b>cell.</b> Thus, when {{the production of the}} feed stream to the Jameson Cell decreased {{as a result of a}} fluctuation elsewhere in the concentrator, a higher percentage of the tailings was automatically recycled to the downcomers, producing a constant flow rate, hence feed pressure, to the cell. This had the added benefit of giving a proportion of the tailings (typically 40%) a second pass through the system, which resulted in higher recoveries. In coal fines flotation, this allowed a single Cell to achieve the same recovery of combustibles as had previously been achieved in some two-stage Cell systems.|$|E

50|$|There are {{a number}} of cells able to be used for the {{flotation}} of minerals. these include flotation columns and mechanical <b>flotation</b> <b>cells.</b> The <b>flotation</b> columns are used for finer minerals and they typically have a higher grade and lower recovery of minerals than mechanical <b>flotation</b> <b>cells.</b> The cells in use at the moment can exceed 300 m3.

The relative contributions to froth stability from frother in solution and solids loading in the froth were investigated in both concentrators, and links were found between both the froth half-life and bubble size {{on the top of the}} froth and the amount and nature (hydrophobicity) of particles in the concentrate. The comparison also suggests how two significantly different operating strategies for the froth phase may lead to similar outcomes in terms of froth recovery...|$|R
