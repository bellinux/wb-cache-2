500|$|In 2004, Charles re-recorded [...] "Here We Go Again" [...] as a {{duet with}} American singer-songwriter Norah Jones, who grew up {{listening}} to his music. During Jones' Billboard interview for her 2010 collaboration album ...Featuring, which included her [...] "Here We Go Again" [...] duet, she said [...] "I got a call from Ray asking if I'd be interested in singing on this duets record. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> next plane and I brought my mom. We went to his studio and did it live with the band. I sang it right next to Ray, watching his mouth for the phrasing. He was very sweet and put me at ease, which was great because I was petrified walking in there." [...] She noted in one ...Featuring interview that the only part that was not done live was a piano overlay that she added afterwards to complement Charles' keyboard. In the same interview, she noted that she had been given the opportunity to select a song from Charles' songbook to perform as a duet and felt that this one provided the best opportunity to harmonize rather than alternate vocal verses. On the record, the two singers vocalize, accompanied by Billy Preston on Hammond organ, who had at one time been the regular organist in Charles' band.|$|E
500|$|Tina fell in {{love for}} the first time with a boy named Harry. She spoke about this {{relationship}} in her 1986 interview with Rolling Stone. [...] "It was a basketball game – the school Harry attended was playing my school. I was just graduating from junior high. Well, I looked across the gym and saw Harry, and I {{fell in love}}. My heart was beating so fast. I'm a very bold person, so I ran down to the coach and said, 'Who is number 9?' I just had to have that guy. And he said, 'His name is Harry.' And then he told Harry that I had asked who he was. And Harry looked up at me, and I'll never forget it; it was love at first sight." [...] She recalls he was a playboy,"Harry was real popular and had tons of girlfriends, but eventually I got him, and we went steady for a year." [...] The reason for their break-up she says, [...] "Harry and I broke up because he started playing around. He started dating a girl named Theresa, and by the time he and I got back together, she had become pregnant. He felt he should marry her. I wish he had told me his decision himself, but he didn't. One morning <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bus to school, and my friend said, 'Did you hear that Theresa and Harry got married?' I had to go a full day without crying. At the end of the day, I cried it all out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Most famously, {{the train}} was {{depicted}} in Natsume Sōseki's 1906 novel, Botchan: [...] "I found the train station soon enough and bought myself a ticket. When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> train, it looked as dinky as a matchbox. It had hardly started to get rolling when it was already time to get off; the whole ride couldn't have taken [...] more than five minutes.

He {{returned to the}} show a month later, on May 29, performing [...] "Complicated" [...] and Oprah's favorite song from the album, [...] "Would That Make U Love Me", while also promoting Beyoncé's tour, on which he would be an opening act. Oprah revealed that Thicke's initial appearance garnered a strong reaction, noting that people called the show {{to say that they}} didn't know he would be on. Oprah explained, [...] "So what I {{wanted to do was to}} accommodate all of the people who missed it the first time... In order to do that, I had to do something I've never done before. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> phone and asked this very special guest if he would consider coming back." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{writer of}} Earth 2, Tom Taylor, {{specifically}} resurrected Lois Lane on Earth 2 {{after he was}} told to kill off the character in the Injustice comic series. Taylor stated [...] "bringing Lois in was quite a personal thing, because having to do such horrible, horrible things to her in Injustice, the first thing I asked when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> book was if I could bring back Lois. Then {{it was just a matter}} of working out exactly how." [...] Taylor received [...] "Women in Refrigerators" [...] criticism for his Injustice comic stories. Bringing back Lois as Red Tornado was Taylor's way to [...] "unfridge" [...] Lois. As Taylor noted, in Lois' first appearance as Red Tornado, Lois literally came out of a blue refrigerator. Other reasons for bringing back Lois involve Superman, Taylor commented [...] "While evil bastard Superman is out there killing and maiming and destroying, I wanted Lois to exist as the counterpoint to this. She's the beating heart at the center. She's the good Ying to Superman's evil Yang. Where there's Lois, there's hope." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tracht {{was born}} {{and grew up in}} the South Bronx (New York City) with his younger sister, Diana, and parents, Alfred and Gertrude Tracht. His father was a native New Yorker who sold dental supplies; his mother was a Lutheran {{immigrant}} from Germany who stayed home to raise her two children until they were in high school, then became a noted educator. Tracht attended DeWitt Clinton High School and graduated in 1968. He majored in broadcasting at Ithaca College and landed a job at the college radio station. [...] "From the first day <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> air, I was trying to do comedy bits and tell jokes. After my first year in college, I had this station (WYSL) in Buffalo, New York, offer me a big time job." [...] Tracht got a job at WTKO, a low-power top-40 station in Ithaca. The following year, he had moved up to night DJ at a larger station in Binghamton, New York, WENE. Tracht graduated from Ithaca College in 1972 ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Washburn, he and Cimino {{spent three}} days {{together}} in Los Angeles at the Sunset Marquis, hammering out the plot. The script eventually went through several drafts, evolving into a story with three distinct acts. Washburn did not interview any veterans to write The Deer Hunter nor do any research. [...] "I had a month, that was it," [...] he explains. [...] "The clock was ticking. Write the fucking script! But all I {{had to do was}} watch TV. Those combat cameramen in Vietnam were out there in the field with the guys. I mean, they had stuff that you wouldn't dream of seeing about Iraq." [...] When Washburn was finished, he says, Cimino and Joann Carelli, an associate producer on The Deer Hunter who went on to produce two more of Cimino's later films, took him to dinner at a cheap restaurant off the Sunset Strip. He recalls, [...] "We finished, and Joann looks at me across the table, and she says, 'Well, Deric, it's fuck-off time.' I was fired. It was a classic case: you get a dummy, get him to write the goddamn thing, tell him to go fuck himself, put your name on the thing, and he'll go away. I was so tired, I didn't care. I'd been working 20 hours a day for a month. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> plane the next day, and I went back to Manhattan and my carpenter job." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{a safety}} car {{situation}} on Lap 160 of the 2012 Daytona 500, Earnhardt Ganassi Racing driver Juan Pablo Montoya's car had a suspension part failure, and it lost control on turn 3, sharply veering {{right into a}} safety truck and jet dryer trailer, causing a massive diesel/jet fuel fire. As it was seen on video, sparks were seen emanating from Montoya's car right before its hard collision with the jet dryer trailer and left driver's side of the truck. Montoya was treated at the infield care center and released. Montoya's report over the radio after the incident was [...] "I left the pits and felt a really weird vibration and I came back in and checked the rear end {{and said it was}} okay and I got into the backstraight and we were are going fourth gear but wasn't going that fast. Every time <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> gas I could feel the rear squeezing. When I was telling the spotter to have a look how the rear was moving the car just turned right." [...] The driver of the Chevrolet Silverado Crew Cab, Duane Barnes, was taken to a local hospital for observation and was resting comfortably. He was an employee at Michigan International Speedway, a sister track of Daytona. The tracks often share jet dryer equipment on race weekends to help in case of rain such as the case on Sunday, the original scheduled start time of the race. The entire incident took about two hours to clean up before the last 40 (later extended to 42 due to a Green-white-checkered finish) laps were able to be completed.|$|E

60|$|Well, I {{went into}} the coffee-shop, and spent fourpence.
