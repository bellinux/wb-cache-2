5|$|A classic {{site for}} the study of biocolonisation from founder populations that arrive from outside (allochthonous), Surtsey was {{declared}} a nature reserve in 1965, while the eruption was still in active progress. Today only a few scientists are permitted to land on Surtsey; the only way anyone <b>else</b> <b>can</b> see it closely is from a small plane. This allows the natural ecological succession for the island to proceed without outside interference. In 2008, UNESCO declared the island a World Heritage Site, in recognition of its great scientific value.|$|E
5|$|She {{then moves}} {{out onto a}} dock, where she meets Ben Linus. Juliet is shown {{operating}} with Ethan and Goodwin (Brett Cullen) on a pregnant patient, Sabine, who dies; she is comforted by Goodwin. Juliet meets with Ben, and explains her theory that the problems with pregnant women happen at conception. She wants to test this theory by having a woman conceive off the island, but Ben refuses to let anyone off the island. When Juliet tells him that nothing <b>else</b> <b>can</b> be done and asks {{to go home and}} be with her sister, Ben informs Juliet that her sister's cancer has come back. He offers her a choice: either Juliet can go home and be with her sister as she dies, or she can stay and he will have Jacob cure her sister's cancer.|$|E

Beyond that little <b>else</b> <b>can</b> be said with any certainty at all. As a result, proponents of one theory can assign him a place in time and role with little to argue against it while others can take a wholly different perspective.|$|E

If the wife does not ask the questions, the leader of the seder asks them. And even two scholars who know the laws of Passover must ask one another (if no one <b>else</b> <b>can</b> ask).|$|E

25|$|A MapMaker is also {{available}} that can create playable levels. Levels for Story mode can be made as well as levels for Arcade mode. Created Story levels, however, cannot be played co-operatively. Maps are created by selecting and placing different pre-made tiles and rooms onto a grid. Spawn points, weapons, bags, armour, and objectives can then be placed anywhere on the level. There is a bar in {{the left side of}} the screen, representing memory, that lowers each time a tile or item is placed. When the bar depletes completely, nothing <b>else</b> <b>can</b> be placed onto the map. However, items can be deleted to increase memory. A theme can be chosen for each map such as Victorian, Industrial, Alien, and Virtual, which changes how the rooms appear.|$|E

25|$|If {{someone were}} {{to behave as}} if they {{understood}} a language which no-one <b>else</b> <b>can</b> make sense of, we might call this {{an example of a}} private language. It is not sufficient here, however, for the language to simply be one that has not yet been translated. In order to count as a private language in Wittgenstein's sense, it must be in principle incapable of translation into an ordinary language - if for example it were to describe those inner experiences supposed to be inaccessible to others. The private language being considered is not simply a language in fact understood by one person, but a language that in principle can only be understood by one person. So the last speaker of a dying language would not be speaking a private language, since the language remains in principle learnable. A private language must be unlearnable and untranslatable, and yet it must appear that the speaker is able to make sense of it.|$|E
25|$|To date, {{there is}} no {{evidence}} that Paulo Portas personally embezzled any funds from the submarines' purchase, and, since Portugal's 10-year statute of limitations for white collar crimes expired in 2014, he (or anyone <b>else)</b> <b>can</b> no longer be prosecuted even if incriminating evidence were to emerge some day. Still, the suspicions against Paulo Portas are unlikely to ever go away given the established facts that (i) he was the Minister in-charge at the time, which makes him the main figure in a controversial deal that, even if not tainted by his corruption, was disastrous for Portugal's finances; (ii) in contrast with his usual incisiveness on all other affairs of state, Paulo Portas has consistently been evasive about his role and any details of the submarines purchase; (iii) his CDS-PP party was shown to have been in close contact with one of the submarines' intermediaries (ESCOM) and to have received sizeable donations from fabricated sources shortly after (see Portucale case above); and (iv) Portas himself is on record saying he could not talk about the submarines deal on a cell phone for fear of being wiretapped, which suggests he might have had something to hide.|$|E
25|$|Saul sets David {{over his}} army. All Israel loves David, but his {{popularity}} causes Saul to fear him ("What <b>else</b> <b>can</b> he wish but the kingdom?"). Saul plots his death, but Saul's son Jonathan, {{one of those}} who loves David, warns him of his father's schemes and David flees. He goes first to Nob, where he is fed by the priest Ahimelech and given Goliath's sword, and then to Gath, the Philistine city of Goliath, intending to seek refuge with King Achish there. Achish's servants or officials question his loyalty, and David sees that he is in danger there. He goes next to the cave of Adullam, where his family join him. From there he goes to seek refuge with the king of Moab, but the prophet Gad advises him to leave and he goes to the Forest of Hereth, and then to Keilah, where is involved in a further battle with the Philistines. Saul plans to besiege Keilah so that he can capture David, so David leaves the city in order to protect its inhabitants. From there he takes refuge in the mountainous Wilderness of Ziph.|$|E

25|$|When such a {{complete}} convulsion has shaken the State, and hardly left any thing whatsoever, either in civil arrangements, {{or in the}} Characters and disposition of men's minds, exactly where it was, whatever shall be settled although in the former persons and upon old forms, will be in some measure a new thing and will labour under something of the weakness {{as well as other}} inconveniences of a Change. My poor opinion is that you mean to establish what you call 'L'ancien Régime,' If any one means that system of Court Intrigue miscalled a Government as it stood, at Versailles before the present confusions as the thing to be established, that I believe will be found absolutely impossible; and if you consider the Nature, as well of persons, as of affairs, I flatter myself you must be of my opinion. That was tho' not so violent a State of Anarchy as well as the present. If it were even possible to lay things down exactly as they stood, before the series of experimental politicks began, I am quite sure that they could not long continue in that situation. In one Sense of L'Ancien Régime I am clear that nothing <b>else</b> <b>can</b> reasonably be done.|$|E

Feodora also lacked an interest in her studies, a deficit blamed by Vicky on a lack of parental guidance, as Charlotte and Bernhard were frequently away.
