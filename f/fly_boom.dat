25|$|Prior to {{demonstration}} {{for passenger}} airlines, the Dash 80 was fitted with Boeing's <b>Flying</b> <b>Boom</b> for aerial refueling {{which served as}} a prototype for the KC-135 Stratotanker and its later derivatives.|$|R
25|$|Definitive bomber {{version of}} the B-50. Higher max takeoff weight (173,000lb (78,600kg)). Fitted with {{receptacle}} for <b>Flying</b> <b>boom</b> in-flight refueling and provision for underwing drop tanks. Modified nose glazing with 7-piece nose cone window {{was replaced by a}} single plastic cone and a flat bomb-aimer's window. A total of 222 were built.|$|R
60|$|Over a {{concrete}} bridge fled a limousine of long sleek hood and noiseless engine. These people in evening clothes were returning from an all-night rehearsal of a Little Theater play, an artistic adventure considerably illuminated by champagne. Below the bridge curved a railroad, {{a maze of}} green and crimson lights. The New York <b>Flyer</b> <b>boomed</b> past, and twenty lines of polished steel leaped into the glare.|$|R
2500|$|While the B-54 was canceled, {{production}} of less elaborate developments continued as a stopgap until jet bombers like the Boeing B-47 and B-52 could enter service. Forty-five B-50Bs, fitted with lightweight fuel tanks {{and capable of}} operating at higher weights, were built, followed by 222 B-50Ds, capable of carrying underwing fuel tanks and distinguished by a one-piece plastic nose dome. To give the Superfortress the range to reach the Soviet Union, B-50s were fitted to be refueled in flight. Most (but not all) of the B-50As were fitted with the early [...] "looped hose" [...] refueling system, developed by the British company Flight Refuelling Limited, in which the receiving aircraft would use a grapple to catch a line trailed by the tanker aircraft (normally a Boeing KB-29) before hauling over the fuel line to allow transfer of fuel to begin. While this system worked, it was clumsy, and Boeing designed the alternative <b>Flying</b> <b>Boom</b> method to refuel SAC's bombers, with most B-50Ds being fitted with receptacles for <b>Flying</b> <b>Boom</b> refueling.|$|R

6000|$|He {{closed the}} door and wabbled swiftly down the long drab hall of the [...] "railroad flat," [...] evidently trying to walk straight. The reeking {{stifling}} main room {{at the end of the}} hall was terrible as Charley's eyes. <b>Flies</b> <b>boomed</b> everywhere. The oak table, which Charley and his bride had once spent four happy hours in selecting, was littered with half a dozen empty whisky-flasks, collars, torn sensational newspapers, dirty plates and coffee-cups. The cheap brocade cover, which a bride had once joyed to embroider with red and green roses, was half pulled off and dragged on the floor amid the cigarette butts, Durham tobacco, and bacon rinds which covered the green-and-yellow carpet-rug.|$|R
50|$|Crops {{planted on}} refuge land {{includes}} alfalfa, wheat, rye grass, milo, millet, and sudan grass. With use {{restrictions on the}} use of certain pesticides on the refuge, infestations of white <b>flies,</b> and the <b>booming</b> prices of sudan grass, many cooperative farmers have switched from planting alfalfa to sudan grass over the years. Sudan grass grows like a weed in the Imperial Valley and requires little to no use of pesticides.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} seen no beauty," [...] said the generous lieutenant, laughing; [...] "but there is long Tom, as hard-featured a youth of two score and ten as ever washed in brine, who has a heart as big, ay, bigger {{than that of a}} kraaken. A bright watch to you, boy, and {{remember}} a keen eye on the battery." [...] As he was yet speaking, Barnstable crossed the gunwale of his little vessel, and it was not until he was seated by the side of his prisoner that he continued, aloud: [...] "Cast the stops off your sails, Mr. Merry, and see all clear to make a run of everything; recollect, you are short-handed, sir. God bless ye! and d'ye hear? if there is a man among you who shuts more than one eye at a time, I'll make him, when I get back, open both wider than if Tom Coffin's friend, the <b>Flying</b> Dutchman, was <b>booming</b> down upon him. God bless ye, Merry, my boy; give 'em the square-sail, if this breeze off-shore holds on till morning:--shove off." ...|$|R
