5|$|Immobile Holliday <b>junctions,</b> with {{asymmetrical}} sequences that {{lock the}} strands {{in a specific}} position, were artificially created by scientists to study their structure {{as a model for}} natural Holliday <b>junctions.</b> These <b>junctions</b> also later found use as basic structural building blocks in DNA nanotechnology, where multiple Holliday <b>junctions</b> can be combined into specific designed geometries that provide molecules {{with a high degree of}} structural rigidity.|$|E
5|$|In biology, Holliday <b>junctions</b> {{are a key}} {{intermediate}} in {{many types}} of genetic recombination, {{as well as in}} double-strand break repair. These <b>junctions</b> usually have a symmetrical sequence and are thus mobile, meaning that the four individual arms may slide through the junction in a specific pattern that largely preserves base pairing. Additionally, four-arm <b>junctions</b> similar to Holliday <b>junctions</b> appear in some functional RNA molecules.|$|E

5|$|The North Circular Road {{ceased to}} be a trunk road in 2000, when control of all roads inside Greater London passed to Transport for London (TfL). In 2004, Mayor of London Ken Livingstone promised limited {{improvements}} to the road, but received criticism for not approving earlier plans for widening the often heavily congested road at critical sections. In 2009, it was announced that major works between the Bounds Green Road and Green Lanes <b>junctions</b> would finally go ahead, having been proposed for over 90 years, and was completed the following year. The work improved the carriageway between these <b>junctions,</b> widening Telford Road to two lanes and improving all of the <b>junctions</b> along the route. Improvements were also made to walkways and cycle paths along this route. However, unlike elsewhere on the North Circular, the new <b>junctions</b> are not grade-separated and have been designed with environmental concerns in mind. The opened scheme is a reduced specification from 1960s plans, which projected this section of the North Circular to be dual carriageway.|$|E
5|$|The North Circular Road has a {{wide variety}} of styles and {{standards}} of <b>junctions</b> connecting to other roads. These range from the complex, grade-separated design at Charlie Brown's near Woodford, to at-grade <b>junctions</b> with traffic lights. The original road contained entirely at-grade junctions; many of these were improved and grade separated during the late 1970s and early 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} such motif is the double {{crossover}} (DX) complex, which contains two Holliday <b>junctions</b> {{in close proximity}} to each other, resulting in a rigid structure that can self-assemble into larger arrays. The structure of the DX molecule forces the Holliday <b>junctions</b> to adopt a conformation with the double-helical domains directly side-by-side, in contrast to their preferred angle of about 60Â°. The complex can be designed to force the <b>junctions</b> into either a parallel or antiparallel orientation, but in practice the antiparallel variety are more well-behaved, and the parallel version is rarely used.|$|E

5|$|There {{are flat}} <b>junctions</b> {{at each end}} of the station: Herne Hill North Junction, where the lines to Loughborough Junction and Brixton diverge; and Herne Hill South Junction, where the lines to West Dulwich and Tulse Hill diverge. Thameslink and Southeastern {{services}} cross each other's paths at the <b>junctions,</b> constraining capacity on both routes. The station also has a turnback siding on its eastern side, adjacent to Milkwood Road.|$|E
5|$|A {{commonly}} studied {{variation of}} the problem involves networks of interior-disjoint smooth curves, with <b>junctions</b> where three {{or more of the}} curves meet. When the <b>junctions</b> all have exactly three curves meeting at angles of 2/3 (the same conditions seen in an optimal Steiner tree or two-dimensional foam of soap bubbles) the flow is well-defined for the short term. However, it may eventually reach a singular state with four or more curves meeting at a junction, and there may be {{more than one way to}} continue the flow past such a singularity.|$|E

5|$|Mr. Nobody is a 2009 {{science fiction}} drama film written and {{directed}} by Jaco Van Dormael and starring Jared Leto, Sarah Polley, Diane Kruger, Linh Dan Pham, Rhys Ifans, Natasha Little, Toby Regbo and Juno Temple. The film tells the life story of Nemo Nobody, a 118-year-old man who is the last mortal on Earth after the human race has achieved quasi-immortality. Nemo, memory fading, refers to his three main loves and to his parents' divorce and subsequent hardships endured at three critical <b>junctions</b> in his life: at age nine, fifteen, and thirty-four. Alternate life paths branching out from each of those critical <b>junctions</b> are examined. The speculative narrative often changes course with the flick of a different possible decision at each of those ages. The film uses nonlinear narrative and the multiverse hypothesis style.|$|E
