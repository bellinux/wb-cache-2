25|$|Christian music festivals now exist {{throughout}} the world. The Greenbelt festival, founded in 1974 in the United Kingdom, {{was at one}} time {{one of the largest}} recurring Christian event in the world. Germany is host to several festivals; four of the most notable are Christmas Rock Night, Freakstock, Himmelfahrt-Festival and Rock Without Limits. In greater Europe notable festivals include Flevo and EO-Youth Day in the Netherlands, Seaside Festival in Norway, the Big Boss' Festival in Switzerland, the Song of Songs Festival in Poland, Festival Lumen in Slovakia and <b>Frizon</b> Festival in Sweden.|$|E
50|$|Although <b>Frizon</b> {{released}} shoes {{under her}} brands Maud <b>Frizon</b> and Miss Maud, she also designed footwear for Azzedine Alaia, Missoni and Sonia Rykiel among others.|$|E
50|$|In 1999 <b>Frizon</b> and De Marco {{sold the}} company and its brands to Helene Wajnblum-Liu and her husband, who added {{handbags}} and leather accessories to the line as well as expanding the chain of <b>Frizon</b> boutiques. The firm remains headquartered in Paris, with boutiques in Paris, New York, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong.|$|E
50|$|<b>Frizon</b> is a commune in the Vosges {{department}} in Grand Est in northeastern France.|$|E
50|$|That first shoe collection, {{with each}} pair hand-cut and finished, was praised by critics as sexy and unpredictable. <b>Frizon</b> was an {{immediate}} success. Building on the traditions of Beth Levine and foreshadowing the later designs of Manolo Blahnik, <b>Frizon</b> shoes were showy and extravagant, and her name {{joined the ranks of}} the haute couture boutiques. At the height of her success in the 1980s her reputation was similar to that of Blahnik today.|$|E
50|$|Neighbouring communes are Portieux to the north, Châtel-sur-Moselle in the east, Vaxoncourt to the south-east, Igney in the south, <b>Frizon</b> to the {{south-west}} and Vincey in the West.|$|E
50|$|Maud <b>Frizon</b> de Marco (born Danielle Maud Frizon; 1941 in Paris, France) is {{a fashion}} {{designer}} specializing in women's shoes. She began {{her career in}} the 1960s {{as a model for}} Parisian Haute Couture Houses of Nina Ricci, Jean Patou, and André Courrèges. At the time models had to provide their own shoes to match the clothes designers assigned them for their runway shows and photo shoots. <b>Frizon</b> disliked the available shoes from other designers, and in 1969 elected to create her own and opened her first boutique in the Saint-Germain-des-Prés district of Paris.|$|E
50|$|In 2007, This Beautiful Republic {{performed}} at several notable festivals including Lifest, Alive Festival, Godstock, Ichthus Festival, Soul Fest, <b>Frizon</b> Festival in Sweden, and Flevo Festival in The Netherlands.|$|E
50|$|<b>Frizon</b> {{often used}} {{expensive}} and everyday materials together in unusual combinations: lizard and snake, suede and satin, canvas and crocodile. Brigitte Bardot {{was a regular}} at the boutique, famous for her love of Frizon's high-heeled Russian boots.|$|E
50|$|Going on {{to serve}} as a {{freelance}} designer, Louboutin designed women's shoes for Chanel, Yves Saint Laurent, and Maud <b>Frizon.</b> In the late 1980s, he turned away from fashion to become a landscape gardener and to contribute to Vogue but missed working with shoes and set up his company in 1991.|$|E
50|$|There {{have always}} been {{elements}} within the Swedish hip hop scene that has reacted against the commercial aspects {{of the music industry}} and have tried to find alternative distribution and marketing channels for the music. The Internet has had a significant impact in how media is communicated, and through various online communities people without record deals have also been able to find audiences for their music. Examples of such communities that are centered around Swedish hip hop are <b>Frizon</b> and Whoa.nu.|$|E

5000|$|Charlotte Lobjoie was a dancer, {{although}} she apparently only {{took up the}} profession after she moved to Paris, months {{after the birth of}} Jean-Marie {{and the end of the}} war. Jean-Marie spent his first seven years with his grandparents, with whom Charlotte had no contact after moving to Paris. On 22 May 1922, Charlotte married Clément Loret, a lithographer, who declared he would support his wife's illegitimate son and would allow him to bear his own last name. According to Jean-Marie, his grandparents had [...] "treated him badly." [...] After their deaths in the mid 1920s, his aunt, Alice Lobjoie, worked to have her nephew adopted by the family of the wealthy construction magnate <b>Frizon</b> from Saint Quentin. From then on, Jean-Marie attended consecutively Catholic boarding schools in Cambrai and Saint Quentin.|$|E
50|$|In 1679, Charpentier {{had been}} singled out to compose for Louis XIV's son, the Dauphin. Writing {{primarily}} for the prince's private chapel, he composed devotional pieces for a small ensemble composed of royal musicians: the two Pièche sisters singing with a bass named <b>Frizon,</b> and instruments played by the two Pièche brothers. In short, an ensemble that, with Mlle de Guise's permission, could perform works he had earlier composed for the Guises. By early 1683, when he was awarded a royal pension, Charpentier was being commissioned to write for court {{events such as the}} annual Corpus Christi procession. In April of that year, he became so ill that he had to withdraw from the competition for the sub-mastership of the royal chapel. Speculations that he withdrew because he knew he would not win seem disproved by his autograph notebooks: he wrote nothing at all from April through mid-August of that year, strong evidence that he was too ill to work.|$|E
5000|$|Ferguson {{launched}} {{his career at}} the turn of the 1970s/80s with hand-painted leather goods and furniture. On 20 August 1980, Harper's Bazaar featured a photograph by Francesco Scavullo of the model Kelly Le Brock wrapped in Ferguson's painted leathers. One of Ferguson's first successes was a decorative wooden flapper doll for the Mudd Club, which attracted the attention of the designer Patricia Field and led to her commissioning his hand-painted leather and chiffon dresses for her boutique. He also made painted leather garments, including shawls and kilts for Maud <b>Frizon,</b> Carol Rollo at 'Riding High', and Johnny Ward. His designs were also stocked by Robert Lee Morris in his Artwear shop, a showcase for artisan jewelry and accessories. In 1981 Ferguson was highlighted by The New York Times as one of a new wave of up-and-coming British and American designers alongside 'Vivien Westwood'sic, Anna Sui, and Mary Jane Marcasiano. Although his hand-painted suede and chiffon work was described as initially seeming 'more like rags than fashion,' once it was on a figure, it came together to create a look that 'seemed at once ancient and modern'.|$|E

40|$|International audienceA {{geological}} map of Africa at 1 / 10 000 000 {{scale and}} its major ore deposits was prepared {{in the frame}} of the 35 th Colloquium on African Geology held in Orléans in June 2004. This map, co-published by the BRGM (France) and the Geological Society of Africa was realized under the scientific coordination of J. P. Milesi, J. L. Feybesse, P. Pinna, Y. Deschamps, H. Kampunzu, S. Muhongo, J. L. Lescuyer and S. F. Toteu [1]. It was provided as a paper and digital document to all participants to the congress and further distributed by the BRGM. Later this map was used as an essential input in the realization of the 2 nd edition of the Tectonic Map of Africa co-published in 2010 by CGMW and UNESCO under the scientific coordination of J. P. Milesi, D. <b>Frizon</b> de Lamote, G. de Kock and F. Toteu [2]. More than ten years later, it appeared that many regional mapping projects and very abundant scientific publications had greatly enhanced our knowledge of African geology. In the perspective of the venue of the IGC 35 in Africa, one could therefore consider {{that the time has come}} for updating the 2004 map. The project of editing an updated geological map of Africa at 1 / 10 000 000 was planned in consultation between the Scientific Chair of the IGC, the CGMW, the GSAF and the BRGM who accepted to assume the scientific coordination. Different partners joined the project to cover different parts of the map, either thematic or geographic. All these partners are associated as co-authors to the final document which will be presented at the Subsymposia 1 - 6 /CGMW of the IGC 35. This new geological map of Africa rests on a deeply reworked legend and important upgrades in large regions based on data from a number of new national geological maps published since 2004. The legend takes into account the international chronostratigraphic chart published by the International Commission on Stratigraphy. Likewise, the colors used for the different cartographic units are those recommended by the CGMW and follow a strictly chronological scheme. Superimposed symbols allow the different lithologies to be distinguished. Recent surficial formations (e. g. Quaternary desert sands) have been represented to their real geographical extension. This new map is intended to provide an updated vision of the African geology at a small scale with the aim of illustrating the main phases of the geological history of the continent...|$|E
