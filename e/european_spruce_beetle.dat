The role of the <b>European</b> <b>spruce</b> bark <b>beetle</b> in the Białowieża Forest is discussed based on the experience gained in Europe’s forests.

50|$|The <b>European</b> <b>spruce</b> bark <b>beetle</b> (Ips typographus) , is {{a species}} of beetle in the weevil {{subfamily}} Scolytinae, the bark beetles, and is found from Europe to Asia Minor and some parts of Africa.|$|R
50|$|Beetles of this tribe {{specialize}} on conifers. Many species, {{such as the}} six-spined {{engraver beetle}} (Ips sexdentatus) and the <b>European</b> <b>spruce</b> bark <b>beetle</b> (Ips typographus), produce galleries in wood for their eggs and larvae.|$|R
50|$|The <b>European</b> <b>spruce</b> bark <b>beetle</b> has a {{significant}} impact on both the ecological and economic environment of Norway spruce forests. Together with storm events, bark beetle outbreaks are thought by some {{to be one of the}} most important natural disturbances in this region. Some scientists consider this beetle to be a keystone species, in part because it has an unusually high number of relationships with other organisms in the community and because it changes its environment so drastically. Others disagree, because it is also an invasive species in the area.|$|R
5000|$|Polish {{environmentalists say}} that logging is {{threatening}} the {{flora and fauna}} in the forest, including species of rare birds, such as the white-backed woodpecker, who lost 30% of their population in forestry-managed areas in the 1990s and 2000s. Poland's state forestry board claims the logging is for protection and for ecological reasons, [...] protecting against the <b>European</b> <b>spruce</b> bark <b>beetle.</b> From 2012, the amount of wood that can be extracted by foresters annually was reduced from about [...] to just [...] and most of it is sold locally, mainly as firewood.|$|R
50|$|The {{productive}} {{forest in}} Norway {{is expected to}} increase considerably due to climate change, but not without complications. Mild winters will reduce the resistance of trees and their frost tolerance. Freeze-thaw cycles will also be more frequent during mild winters, damaging the trees. Pest invasions and diseases are expected to be more frequent as new pests can move rapidly northwards. It is also possible that insects will be able to reproduce one more generation per summer due to higher temperatures, so that for instance the <b>European</b> <b>spruce</b> bark <b>beetle</b> may damage <b>spruce</b> trees with an extra invasion per summer.|$|R
40|$|Forest {{management}} greatly {{affects the}} population {{density of the}} <b>European</b> <b>spruce</b> bark <b>beetle,</b> Ips typographus. In this study, a meta-analysis {{was used to determine}} whether infection levels of pathogens of I. typographus differ between managed and unmanaged spruce stands. The analysis used data from 10 publications and a total of 61 locations. The results indicated that infection levels of the most common pathogens (ItEPV, Gregarina typographi, and Mattesia schwenkei) are higher in unmanaged than in managed locations. The only exception is the microsporidium Chytridiopsis typographi, which is more common in managed than in unmanaged locations. Our meta-analysis indicates that pathogen levels are generally higher in unmanaged than in managed locations...|$|R
50|$|Nematodes of Micoletzkya live in {{symbiosis}} with bark beetles. The hosts include economically important species across North America and Europe such as {{the mountain}} pine beetle Dendroctonus ponderosae and <b>European</b> <b>spruce</b> bark <b>beetle</b> Ips typographus. The life history of the nematodes is closely linked to that of their hosts. Infective (dauer) larvae of Micoletzkya attach themselves onto the body surface of a beetle for transmission and resume their development in host breeding galleries. In the bark beetle galleries, nematodes go through a few free-living generations, presumably feeding on beetle-associated microorganisms and other nematodes, after which dauer larvae develop and attach to newly emerging bark beetles for transmission.|$|R
40|$|In {{the years}} 2005 – 2006, in the Karkonoski National Park there were {{conducted}} observations on infestation of spruce trees by bark beetles (Col., Curculionidae, Scolytinae). Data on bark beetle species composition {{and frequency of}} occurrence of individual species were collected. The data on development phenology of the small <b>spruce</b> bark <b>beetle</b> Ips amitinus in the upper subalpine spruce forest sites (1000 – 1250 m a. s. l.) indicated higher frequency of occurrence of this species (26. 3 %) {{when compared to the}} <b>European</b> <b>spruce</b> bark <b>beetle</b> Ips typographus. The study included analyses of population size, density, fecundity and mortality of I. amitinus. The rate of development in I. amitinus in the Karkonosze Mts. is similar to that observed in the Alps. The number of laid eggs observed was low and the reproduction success was very high at minimal mortality. Establishment of feeding galleries and egg laying lasted several weeks and 1 / 3 of feeding galleries were found in the second series of trap trees...|$|R
30|$|As {{its range}} {{extended}} {{from east to}} west progressively, the great <b>European</b> <b>spruce</b> bark <b>beetle</b> Dendroctonus micans (Kugelann) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae) headed from Georgia to Turkey. The first report on its presence in Turkey came in 1966 (Yaman and Radek 2008). In spite of the comprehensive and costly endeavors to control the beetle, it continues to damage the economy of Turkey. In more than three decades, approximately 250.000  ha have adversely been impacted and no fewer than ten million spruce trees have been killed (Yaman and Radek 2008). D. micans is a notable defoliator of species of pine trees in Turkey and {{in the rest of the}} Mediterranean (Yaman and Radek 2008). It is also found in other countries, which have spent a great deal of money for controlling it (Grégoire 1984; Yaman et al. 2010).|$|R
40|$|Entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana {{is one of}} {{many species}} of entomopathogenic fungi used as a {{biological}} protection against plant pest.

This work describes besides a detailed description of the Beauveria bassiana also other six important fungal species used for biological protection (Hirsutella, Isaria, Metarhizium, Nomuraea, Paecilomyces, Verticillium) and provides a detailed description of four available commercial biopreparations, namely BotaniGard 22 WP, BotaniGard EC, Mycotrol O, Naturalis L which can be practically used for pest suppression. The work also provides information about two products developed in the former Czechoslovakia, Boverol and Boverosil.

40|$|During {{outbreak}} periods, the <b>European</b> <b>spruce</b> bark <b>beetle</b> and the North American {{mountain pine}} beetle {{are able to}} kill millions of coniferous trees. Throughout the 20 th century, six outbreaks have occurred in Sweden and four in British Columbia, with about 20 -year intervals in both regions. The outbreaks of the mountain pine beetles seem to grow much larger and last longer compared to the outbreaks of the <b>spruce</b> bark <b>beetles.</b> Over the years, the mountain pine beetle has killed about 60 million ha forest or 550 million m 3 trees in British Columbia, which {{is at least one}} hundred times more than for the <b>Spruce</b> bark <b>beetle</b> in Sweden. Damages of both species have increased markedly in the last forty years. About 750 <b>spruce</b> bark <b>beetles</b> per m 2 are necessary to kill a healthy spruce, whereas seven times fewer, i. e., about 110 mountain pine beetles per m 2, are needed to kill a healthy pine. Furthermore, twice as many offspring per m 2 bark are produced by the <b>spruce</b> bark <b>beetle</b> compared to the mountain pine beetle. An explanation for the large differences in population dynamics between these two beetle species may spring from differences in (1) the availability of host trees, (2) number of specimens required to kill a tree, and (3) reproductive success. The latter is in turn affected by the intraspecific competition, nutrient content, and occurrence of fungi...|$|R
40|$|Bark beetle {{outbreaks}} have {{a devastating}} effect on economically important forests worldwide, thus requiring extensive application of management control strategies. The presence of unmanaged protected areas {{in close proximity}} to managed forests can instigate concerns that bark beetle infestations may spread from unmanaged into managed stands. We studied the impact of differential management of forest stands on the dispersal dynamics of the <b>European</b> <b>spruce</b> bark <b>beetle,</b> Ips typographus, making use of inferential population genetics on mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. Bayesian inferences of migration rates and a most parsimonious dispersal tree show that outgoing gene flow was consistently higher from managed to unmanaged areas. Reason for that is likely the thorough removal of potential breeding material in managed forests and thus the dispersal of the base stock beetles from these areas to unmanaged areas where breeding material is available. Our study suggests that the potential threat posed by unmanaged to managed forests in regard to I. typographus infestation needs to be carefully re-considered...|$|R
40|$|Damages by {{wind and}} by <b>European</b> <b>spruce</b> bark <b>beetle</b> (I. typographus L.) were {{compared}} {{on the basis}} of the reports about the occurrence of harmful forest agents for the period 1964 − 1991 across former regional state forest directorates. In the given period, the quantity of salvage logging (70 million m 3) was more than five times that of sanitation felling (13 million m 3). Damage intensity increased over the decades. Using a cross-correlation function between the time series, an increase in the abundance of I. typographus due to windfall was demonstrated with a delay of 1 – 3 years. Wind damage was also shown to arise as a result of disturbed stand stability after sanitation felling with a stochastic delay of 1 − 5 years. Thus, disturbance of static stability of forest stands may be considered as one of the main harmful consequences of bark beetle outbreaks for the near future. Consequences for forest management are discussed...|$|R
50|$|The adults overwinter at {{the base}} of conifers, rarely of {{deciduous}} trees. They emerge in the spring and fly to lower parts of trees to hunt bark beetles. Their common prey are pine bark beetles Tomicus piniperda and T. minor, and the <b>European</b> <b>spruce</b> bark <b>beetle,</b> Ips typographus. Often they are seen waiting their prey on the bark of fallen pine or spruce trees. Both ant beetles and bark beetles are attracted to monoterpenes from the damaged areas of the fallen trees. Stacked wood is especially attractive due to the monoterpene volatiles. The ant beetles are also attracted to specific pheromone components of bark beetles therefore they often fall into bark beetle pheromone traps. The larvae enter the scolytid galleries and feed on the immature stages of the bark beetles. The larvae grow very slowly, spending two years in the larval stage, and pupate in the fall in niches in the outer bark. Adults of T. formicarius live 4 to 10 months.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{dynamics}} of species interactions are of central {{importance for the}} understanding of ecological coexistence, community structure {{and the effects of}} bio-logical invasions. Using bark beetles that colonize the same habitat as an example, we explore species interactions in a resource-based model system with positive feedback between insect abundance and resource availability. The net interspecies interaction was found to be highly dynamic and may alternate in time between competition and mutualism. When both bark beetle species were able to kill trees (‘‘aggressive’’), our simulations showed strong facil-itations between beetle species. This may lead to escape from control by competition, and increase the frequency of outbreaks of tree-killing. The frequency of net positive interactions varied with interaction strengths and the rela-tive aggressiveness of the species and was highest when both species were strongly aggressive; which predicts disastrous outbreaks if, e. g., the <b>European</b> <b>spruce</b> bark <b>beetle</b> Ips typographus and the North American <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> Dendroctonus rufipennis should become interacting species due to introductions. In imbalanced pairs, the rel-atively less aggressive species was facilitated more often than the aggressive species. Net positive interactions did not occur for strongly inferior species, but their survival was an increasing function of interaction strength with aggressive species and availability of resources. The ben-efits for the inferior species in the model are consistent with the structure of one aggressive and several less aggressive or non-aggressive species, which is common in bark beetle communities {{in many parts of the}} world...|$|R
40|$|Six trap {{models were}} {{compared}} {{with respect to their}} ability to capture <b>European</b> <b>spruce</b> bark <b>beetles</b> and technical details in handling and use. All trap models proved to be efficient and gave high captures of beetles during operation for one summer season (2013). Ranking the trap models in descending order of total capture of beetles gave this list: Lindgren trap, Theysohn, prototype-P, Ecotrap, BEKA, and prototype-K. However, there was much variation in trapping results between localities for all trap models, and the estimated means did in most cases not differ significantly between models. The estimated mean capture of the Lindgren trap was significantly higher than for prototype-K and BEKA, but their confidence intervals were wide and they were close to being insignificantly different. The retail price of the traps vary from about 10 € (Ecotrap) to 50 - 55 € (Lindgren), while prices are not available for the two prototypes, which are not in regular production. Advantages and disadvantages concerning weight, size, robustness, draining of rain water, ease of handling and mounting are commented on in the discussion, and technical details of the traps are presented in a separate appendix (6) ...|$|R
40|$|The great <b>European</b> <b>spruce</b> bark <b>beetle</b> (Dendroctonus micans, Curculionidae: Scolytinae) and the boreal <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> (D. punctatus) are two phylogenetically and ecologically close bark beetles. They bore {{galleries}} {{into the}} bark of spruce in Europe and Asia (D. micans) and North America (D. punctatus). We analyze the mechanisms of coevolution between these species and their specific predators: D. micans-Rhizophagus grandis (Coleoptera: Monotomidae) and D. punctatus-Hapalaraea longula (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae). David Pimentel(2) suggested that a prey could evolve resistance against a longstanding associated predator. To test this hypothesis we compare the reproductive success of each predator on both prey and on the red turpentine beetle (D. valens) which is an ecologically close bark beetle outside the geographical range of the predators. R. grandis females fit their oviposition to prey availability probably relying on kairomones. It is likely (but not established) that H. longula developed a similar process. I proceed to chemical analyses (GC-MS using headspace extraction) to identify oviposition stimuli and inhibitors of each predator. Possible differences between prey {{may be linked to}} coevolution with the predator. Bioassays will be able to confirm the role of these molecules. Microorganisms could influence the survival and success of bark beetles, and perhaps also the chemical cues involved in oviposition of the predators. To emphasize their role I consider characterizing the microflora of each bark beetle and using antibiotics. D. micans adults have a reproductive diapause which has never been removed in laboratory. To get full life cycle rearing we use thermoperiods in conditioned rooms to simulate winter. (2) -Hokkanen H. & Pimentel D. (1984) New approach for selecting biological control agents.

40|$|<b>European</b> <b>spruce</b> bark <b>beetle</b> (Ips typographus) is {{a natural}} forest pest that feeds on {{coniferous}} trees, mainly on spruce. Previous studies showed that population growth of bark beetle is supported by warm and dry weather and hindered by cold and humid weather. Temperature affects development rates and influences the number of generations bark beetle may produce during one season; furthermore, it affects survival rates during the winter. Low precipitation leads to water stress of spruce trees which become more prone to bark beetle infestation. High precipitation promotes growth of mold and other natural enemies of bark beetle. The aim of the experimental part of this thesis was to analyze the relationship between population dynamics of bark beetle and weather, {{using data from the}} Šumava national park. Data did not show a significant effect of temperature and precipitation on the population growth rate of bark beetle. The growth rate was significantly correlated only with the abundance of bark beetle in the previous year. For further examination of population dynamics of bark beetle in connection with climate characteristics, it would be required to obtain better and more long-term data on bark beetle abundance; harvested bark beetle wood may be influenced by a variety of interfering (e. g [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|The <b>European</b> <b>spruce</b> bark <b>beetle</b> (Ips typographus) and the North American {{mountain}} pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) may kill millions of trees during outbreak periods. Both species have also experienced large outbreaks in recent years. But {{the magnitude of}} the outbreaks of D. ponderosae is much larger. In this review we compare the outbreak history of I. typographus in Sweden with D. ponderosae in British Columbia in Canada. We also discuss some possible explanations for the difference in outbreak magnitude between the two species. During the last fifty years (1960 - 2009), three outbreaks of I. typographus have occurred in Sweden which resulted in a volume of about 9 million m 3 of killed Norway spruces (Picea abies). During the same period D. ponderosae has killed about 600 million m 3 of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) in British Columbia. Based on a literature review we suggest two factors that may contribute to the much more severe outbreaks caused by D. ponderosae: (1) a lower colonisation density needed by D. ponderosae to overcome tree defences and (2) a higher reproductive success of D. ponderosae in killed trees. In addition, the proportion of old stands, susceptible to bark beetle attacks, is much higher in British Columbia than in Sweden...|$|R

The significant correlations between occurrence of the bark beetle infected trees and their occurrence in previous years were found.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the species composition of insect assemblages colonising stumps of Picea abies (L.) Karst. in mountain conditions. Investigations were carried out in the Eastern Sudetes (south –western Poland) in forest stands situated at 600 – 700 m above sea level. The observations were conducted on stumps left behind after felling 70 – 90 years old Norway spruces. The analysed stumps were colonised by insects from 21 families of 3 orders: Coleoptera (approximately 95 %), Diptera (5 %) and Raphidioptera (0. 2 %). There were 12 Coleoptera families determined with the dominance of Cerambycidae (almost 55 %) and Curculionidae (37 %) including Scolytinae (about 5 %). Diptera were represented by 8 families, of which most abundant was the family Rhagionidae (almost 2 %) followed by Muscidae (1. 4 %) and Syrphidae (1. 2 %). The order Raphidioptera was represented by 1 family: Raphididae (0. 2 %). The spruce stumps were mainly colonised by cambio-xylophagous species which added up to 73 % of all collected specimens. The <b>European</b> <b>spruce</b> longhorn <b>beetle</b> Tetropium castaneum (L.) was most numerous (15. 98 ± 14. 99 specimens/stump) of all observed insects as well as it showed the highest permanence of occurrence (97 % stumps).

Traps were baited with lures for attracting the <b>European</b> <b>spruce</b> bark <b>beetle</b> (Ips typographus L.) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae). Among the tested traps, four types are commercial products; Theysohn (T-trap), Ecotrap (E-trap), Lindgren funnel trap (L-trap), BEKA trap (B-trap) and two are our newly developed models; Funnel trap (P-trap) and Cross trap (K-trap). The traps {{were set up}} on ten selected sites and tested during three growing seasons (2012, 2013 and 2014). The newly developed models were compared to the commercially available models for trapping efficiency of target pest, {{easy to use and}} impact on non-target insect species. We found that the best commercially available model is the L-trap, however the bottom of L-trap is considered too shallow resulting in an accumulation of rainwater that increases the traps attractiveness for Silphids. In our experiment, the newly developed models; P-trap and K-trap performed better compared to commercially used models. P-trap caught 28 % more I. typographus and K-trap caught 57 % more beetles compared to T-trap in 2014. There are additional advantages of the newly developed traps such as easy handling, good rainwater drainage, higher collection container volume, and scale marking within the collection container.

This technology can be efficient in carrying out small-area inspections of anomalous reflectance characteristics of trees {{at a very high}} level of detail. Increased frequency and intensity of insect induced forest disturbance has established a new demand for effective methods suitable in mapping and monitoring tasks. In this investigation, a novel miniaturized hyperspectral frame imaging sensor operating in the wavelength range of 500 – 900 nm was used to identify mature Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) trees suffering from infestation, representing a different outbreak phase, by the <b>European</b> <b>spruce</b> bark <b>beetle</b> (Ips typographus L.). We developed a new processing method for analyzing spectral characteristic for high spatial resolution photogrammetric and hyperspectral images in forested environments, as well as for identifying individual anomalous trees. The dense point clouds, measured using image matching, enabled detection of single trees with an accuracy of 74. 7 %. We classified the trees into classes of healthy, infested and dead, and the results were promising. The best results for the overall accuracy were 76 % (Cohen’s kappa 0. 60), when using three color classes (healthy, infested, dead). For two color classes (healthy, dead), the best overall accuracy was 90 % (kappa 0. 80).

40|$|Bark beetle {{outbreaks}} are a {{major threat}} to forest productivity, and a robust forecast of early flight activity is necessary for inhibition or mitigation of large-scale infestations. We used spring phenology of common wild plants in a phenology-based forecasting approach for <b>European</b> <b>spruce</b> bark <b>beetle</b> Ips typographicus L. early flight activity in Bavaria, Southern Germany, and tested this novel approach against traditional thermal sum-based predictions. Our phenology-based forecast employing the 2 phenological phases of first flowering of common snowdrop Galanthus nivalis L. and leaf budburst of horse chestnut Aesculus hippocastanum L. proved to be more robust and accurate than the thermal sum-based forecast. This is explained by both bark beetle phenology and plant phenology being results of a complex control chain of environmental factors, which can be approximated by temperature sums only to a limited degree. However, our space-for-time approach demonstrates strong and unequivocal temperature sensitivity of bark beetle and plant phenology. This indicates a common pattern in bioclimatic mediation of ecophysiological processes for both plants and insects as the mechanistic foundation for forecasting. In the case of costly bark beetle activity monitoring data often characterised by gaps and irregular sampling intervals, plant phenology can thus provide an easily observable alternative or complementary predictor for early flight activity. Our results indicate that forest practitioners can benefit from simple phenological observations to improve the timing of adequate management measures to mitigate bark beetle mass infestations...|$|R
40|$|Bark beetles {{with the}} {{capacity}} to kill and colonize living trees are main pests of coniferous forests around the world. The <b>European</b> <b>spruce</b> bark <b>beetle,</b> Ips typographus, belongs {{to a group of}} bark beetles possessing facultative attack patterns. For long periods I. typographus is living in low populations only on seriously weakened hosts. However, following disturbances like storms or drought periods, the amount of suitable breading material increases dramatically and the population size of beetles may rise within a short time to epidemic levels. In the epidemic phase I. typographus behaves aggressively, attacking healthy trees and destroying large areas of Norway <b>spruce</b> forest. Bark <b>beetles</b> with this pattern of behaviour are exploiting a different ecological niche than during the endemic, low population phase: in broken or seriously weakened hosts they exploit a relatively poor source of nutrients without dealing with host defences. Instead {{they have to deal with}} a higher degree of interspecific competition. On the other hand, a living host provides breeding material, which is rich in nutrients and relatively free from interspecific competition, but there beetles have to fight the defence responses of the host tree. Host defences can be overcome by mass attack of thousands of beetles on the same tree, which is coordinated by aggregation pheromones. The trade-off between evaluating host quality and risk rating host defences is a great challenge for the pioneering beetles, that initiate an attack before any pheromone plumes exist. The host choice mechanism can be divided in several distinct steps: 1. 	habitat location during flight 2. 	host location during flight 3. 	host evaluation after landing, involving detection of host suitability and spacing between species and individuals to avoid inter- or intraspecific competition. 4. 	risk rating host defences after entrance into host phloem. The question whether the beetles’ attack behaviour is ruled by pheromone attraction alone or is guided by markers for host suitability has been an issue of debate for decades. The peripheral nervous system of bark beetles possesses olfactory receptor neurons for both pheromones, host volatiles and non-host volatiles. Several studies support the theory that non-host volatiles cues play an important role in habitat location, while host volatiles are involved in host finding and host acceptance, either alone or through modulating pheromone attraction. Host defence responses consist of physical barriers and chemical compounds that may be detrimental to invaders. Conifers maintain a certain level of preformed (constitutive) defence that can be enhanced during and after the attacks, e. g. by the increased production of defensive metabolites and development of defensive structures. The different metabolites involved in a trees defence responses may be important markers for beetles to evaluate the trees’ defensive ability, and guide them in their decision to enter a host. Because the population density is an important factor influencing the beetles’ success in overwhelming a trees defence, it has been hypothesized that it also will modulate beetles behaviour, either directly or through its influence on the beetles’ quality. This introductory paper is written to obtain an overview over the literature dealing with different aspects of host choice in bark beetle species exhibiting so called aggressive host colonisation behaviour. Different hypotheses and aspects of importance for the host choice behaviour are discussed. Finally, I propose a host choice model for the <b>European</b> <b>spruce</b> bark <b>beetle</b> Ips typographus...|$|R

Tree resistance parameters such as resin flow rate and extent of hypersensitive wound reaction in the phloem were investigated prior to and after fungal infection. Sample trees with different drought treatments (trees fully covered or semi-covered by roofs, control trees) were inoculated with E. polonica in July 2014. In order to check for areas of phloem necrosis, the outer bark around the inoculation holes was scratched off 6 weeks later. We recorded the amount of resin exudation within 12 hours overnight in August and September 2013 and 2014. Although wound reaction zones did not differ in size between tree collectives of the various treatments, fully covered trees tended to exhibit larger necrotic areas compared to control trees. The least water supplied trees showed lowest resin flow rates prior to fungal inoculation, but were the only group to show significantly enhanced resin flow five weeks after the evaluation of defence reactions. Our results agree with earlier findings that wounding and few fungal inoculations can increase tree resistance in the medium term given not too severe water stress. Further investigations will clarify how water stress affects the availability of non-structural carbohydrates for secondary metabolism, when depletion of resources eventually occurs, and at which point trees are most susceptible to bark beetle attack...|$|R

The systematic evidence of forest harmful agents and volume of salvage felling in Slovakia started at the Forest Research Institute in Zvolen in 1960. The paper focuses on the occurrence of the most relevant harmful agents and volume of salvage felling in the Slovak forests over the last decade. Within the 10 years period (2004 – 2013) salvage felling in Slovakia reached 42. 31 mil. m 3 of wood, which was 53. 2 % of the total felling. Wind and <b>European</b> <b>spruce</b> bark <b>beetle</b> Ips typographus damaged 78. 4 % of salvage wood, i. e. they were the most important pest agents. Norway spruce (Picea abies) was the most frequently damaged tree species that represented the amount of 35. 6 mil. m 3 of wood (81. 2 % of total volume of salvage felling). As Norway spruce grows mostly in mountains, these regions of Central and Northern Slovakia were most affected. At the damaged localities new forests were prevailingly established with regard to suitable ecological conditions for trees, climate change scenarios and if possible, natural regeneration has been preferred. These approaches in forest stand regeneration together with silvicultural and control measures are assumed to gradually decrease the amount of salvage felling over long term perspective...|$|R
40|$|<b>Spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> {{outbreaks}} {{have been}} reported in the Rocky Mountains of western North America since the late 1800 s. In their classic paper, <b>Spruce</b> <b>Beetle</b> in the Rockies, Schmid and Frye reviewed the literature that emerged from the extensive outbreaks in Colorado in the 1940 s. A new wave of outbreaks has affected Rocky Mountain subalpine spruce-fir forests beginning in the mid- 1980 s and continuing to the present. These outbreaks have spurred another surge of basic and applied research in the biology, ecology and management of <b>spruce</b> and <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> populations. This paper is a review of literature on <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> focusing on work published since the late 1970 s and is intended as an addendum to <b>Spruce</b> <b>Beetle</b> in the Rockies...|$|R
40|$|Conifer feeding {{bark beetles}} (Coleoptera, Curculionidae, Scolytinae) pose a serious {{economic}} threat to forest production. Volatiles released by non-host angiosperm plants (so called non-host volatiles, NHV) {{have been shown}} {{to reduce the risk of}} attack by many bark beetle species, including the <b>European</b> <b>spruce</b> bark <b>beetle,</b> Ips typographus. However, the most active blend for I. typographus, containing three green leaf volatiles (GLVs) in addition to the key compounds trans-conophthorin (tC) and verbenone, has been considered too expensive for use in large-scale management. To lower the cost and improve the applicability of NHV, we aim to simplify the blend without compromising its anti-attractant potency. Since the key compound tC is expensive in pure form, we also tested a crude version: technical grade trans-conophthorin (T-tC). In another attempt to find a more cost effective substitute for tC, we evaluated a more readily synthesized analog: dehydroconophthorin (DHC). Our results showed that 1 -hexanol alone could replace the three-component GLV blend containing 1 - hexanol, (3 Z) -hexen- 1 -ol, and (2 E) -hexen- 1 -ol. Furthermore, the release rate of tC could be reduced from 5 mg/day to 0. 5 mg/day in a blend with 1 -hexanol and (–) -verbenone without compromising the anti-attractant activity. We further show that T-tC was comparable with tC, whereas DHC was a less effective anti-attractant. DHC also elicited weaker physiological responses in the tC-responding olfactory receptor neuron class, providing a likely mechanistic explanation for its weaker anti-attractive effect. Our results suggest a blend consisting of (–) -verbenone, 1 -hexanol and technical transconophthorin as a cost-efficient anti-attractant for forest protection against I. typographus...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} and {{health status of}} waterlogged or peaty spruce (Picea abies [L. ] Karst.) forests in the summit parts of the Krkonoše Mts. in the Czech Republic were studied in 1979 – 2014. The objective was to evaluate the stand structure, dead wood, trend of the health status and productivity on four permanent research plots (PRP) in relation to air pollution (SO 2 and NOx concentrations) and climatic conditions (temperatures and precipitation amounts). Stand structure was evaluated {{on the base of}} the measured parameters of individual trees on PRP. The health status of trees was evaluated according to foliage, and their vitality was assessed according to their radial growth documented by dendrochronological analyses. The radial growth was negatively correlated with SO 2 and NOx concentrations. Stand dynamics during the observation period was characterised by increased tree mortality, the presence of dead wood and reduction of stand density from 1983 to 1992, while the most severe impairment of health status and stand stability occurred in 1982 – 1987. The foliage mass of living trees has been gradually increasing since 1988, but no pronounced improvement of tree vitality was documented after the decrease in SO 2 concentration. However, particularly physiologically weakened spruce trees were attacked by the <b>European</b> <b>spruce</b> bark <b>beetle</b> (Ips typographus). The process of forest damage is manifested not only by foliage reduction but also by symptoms of various necroses on the assimilatory organs. In terms of climatic data, the weather in April had the most important effect on radial growth. Diameter increment showed positive statistically significant correlation with temperature in growing season, but the precipitation effect was low...|$|R
40|$|Future {{changes in}} climate are {{expected}} to affect disturbance regimes across the globe, which will have important consequences for ecological and social systems. In Colorado, <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> (Dendroctonus rufipennis) outbreak {{is one of the}} most important disturbances. Future warming is expected to promote outbreak through direct effects on beetle population dynamics. However, little is known about if or how climate change will affect the host, Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii). The central goal of this research was to determine the susceptibility of Engelmann <b>spruce</b> to <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> in the context of climate variability in northwestern Colorado. To gain insight into the effects of climate on <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> outbreak, I examined a 350 - year tree-ring record of outbreak. I found <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> outbreaks were initiated by drought, which affects both beetle population dynamics and tree resistance to infestation. To understand if recent warming had affected the susceptibility of spruce, I compared historical (1940 s) and current (2001 - 2011) tree- and stand-scale constraints on outbreak. I found that stand-level constraints appear to be less restrictive of the current outbreak, likely due to drought-driven declines in host resistance. To determine how climate and forest structure interact to influence <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> outbreak, I examined landscape-level outbreak. Outbreak was constrained by forest structure, which reflects past disturbance. In particular, previous outbreak created a landscape template characterized by depleted susceptible hosts, which was less susceptible to subsequent outbreak. A better understanding of the landscape-scale patterns of outbreak requires better scientific monitoring of <b>spruce</b> <b>beetles.</b> This need motivated the development of remote sensing methods for <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> outbreak. This dissertation has revealed important insight into how climate variability alters the susceptibility of <b>spruce</b> to <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> outbreak. Notably, this dissertation highlights the importance of drought in decreasing host resistance to <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> infestation. Future changes in climate will likely promote outbreak through direct effects on host resistance and <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> population dynamics, however how disturbances interact to affect the forest structure and composition will likely be equally or more important in determining future outbreak...|$|R
40|$|The <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> is {{a native}} species in Colorado’s spruce forest ecosystem. Endemic populations are always present, and {{epidemics}} are {{a natural part of}} the changing forest. There usually are long intervals between such events as insect and disease epidemics and wildfires, giving spruce forests time to regenerate. Prior to their occurrence, the potential impacts of these natural disturbances can be reduced through proactive forest management. The <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> (Dendroctonus rufipennis) is {{responsible for the death of}} more spruce trees in North America than any other natural agent. <b>Spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> populations range from Alaska and Newfoundland to as far south as Arizona and New Mexico. The subalpine Engelmann spruce is the primary host tree, but the beetles will infest any spruce tree species within their geographical range, including blue spruce. In Colorado, the beetles are most commonly observed in high-elevation spruce forests above 9, 000 feet. At endemic or low population levels, <b>spruce</b> <b>beetles</b> generally infest only downed trees. However, as <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> population levels in downed trees increase, usually following an avalanche or windthrow event – a high-wind event that topples trees over a large area – the beetles also will infest live standing trees. <b>Spruce</b> <b>beetles</b> prefer large (16 inches in diameter or greater), mature and over-mature spruce trees in slow-growing, spruce-dominated stands. However, at epidemic levels, or when large-scale, rapid population increases occur, <b>spruce</b> <b>beetles</b> may attack trees as small as 3 inches in diameter. Attacks also have been observed in krummholz – trees near timberline that exhibit stunted growth due to harsh conditions. Life History <b>Spruce</b> <b>beetles</b> have a life cycle of one to three years, and a two-year life cycle is the most common. Adult <b>spruce</b> <b>beetles</b> usually are dark brown to black with reddish-brown or black wing covers. They are cylindrical in shape and Figure 1.
