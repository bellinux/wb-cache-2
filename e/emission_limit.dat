500|$|The European Commission (EC) {{claimed that}} Alcan is in breach of their {{operating}} licence as the station {{has failed to}} [...] "significantly reduce its emissions". The UK Government contested the allegations, as the power station and smelter combined then provided 650 jobs and a contribution of £100,000,000 to the local economy, in an area heavily affected {{by the loss of}} traditional heavy industry. They lost the court case over it and on 22 April 2010, the European Court of Justice ruled that the plant was subject to the <b>emission</b> <b>limit</b> values of the European directive on Large Combustion Plants. As a consequence, the station has to have at least £200 million worth of adaptations made to it so that it conforms to the directive, or be shut down. A date has not yet been given for it to conform, but two options for saving the station are the CCS project, or a switch from coal to biomass as a fuel.|$|E

The persisting air quality problems suggest that standard emissions testing in the laboratory may not accurately capture the on-road emissions of light-duty vehicles. To address this hypothesis, we present the first comprehensive on-road emissions test of light-duty vehicles based on state-of-the-art Portable Emission Measurement Systems (PEMS). We find that nitrogen oxides emissions of gasoline vehicles as well as carbon monoxide and total hydrocarbon emissions of both diesel and gasoline vehicles generally stay below the respective <b>emission</b> <b>limits.</b> By contrast,However, Average nitrogen oxides emissions of diesel vehicles (0. 93 ± 0. 39 grams per kilometer [g/km]), including modern Euro 5 diesel vehicles (0. 62 ± 0. 19 g/km), exceed <b>emission</b> <b>limits</b> by 320 ± 90 %. On-road carbon dioxide emissions surpass laboratory emission levels by 21 ± 9 % and exceed the fleet-average emission target for passenger cars by 32 ± 20 %. These findings suggest that the current emissions testing fails to accurately capture the on-road emissions of light-duty vehicles.
