However, it burrows underground and is rarely seen except during the breeding season when it is abundant. It is an explosive breeder; males call <b>from</b> <b>flooded</b> <b>ditches</b> and large temporary pools of rainwater. Eggs are laid in still water.|$|R
40|$|Revised edition. "Methods of irrigating grain {{crops are}} {{restricted}} somewhat {{because of the}} fact that such crops cover the entire surface of the plot on which they are grown. Objections to the flooding methods, based on loss of water by evaporation, have less weight in the irrigation of grain than of other crops, grain fields seldom being irrigated after the seed is planted until the grain is high enough to protect the soil from sun and wind. Grain usually is the first crop grown on irrigated farms. For such farms flooding usually is better than other methods, since the preparation of the land for it is easier than for other methods. <b>Flooding</b> <b>from</b> field <b>ditches</b> is the usual method of handling water in irrigating grain, but the border and basin methods are also adapted to such crops. These methods are described in detail in this bulletin, which also discusses the proper time to irrigate, the quantity of water required, and the cost of growing grain under irrigation.

5000|$|The ditch {{originally}} extended, roughly in a semi-circle, {{for some}} [...] from the River Monnow opposite Chippenham Fields, westwards and then northwards to {{the vicinity of}} the later Drybridge House. The defence comprised a water-filled ditch some 35 to 40 feet (10-12m) wide, with an embankment some 5 feet (1.5m) high {{on the side of the}} settlement, topped by a wooden palisade. [...] It was probably possible to <b>flood</b> the <b>ditch</b> <b>from</b> the River Monnow. [...] A mediaeval stone bridge across the ditch was in direct line with that of Monnow Street, in Monmouth, and the Monnow Bridge across the river. It carried the road from the town westwards towards the village of Wonastow.|$|R

40|$|Agricultural {{practices}} {{can result}} in differences in organic matter (OM) and agricultural chemical inputs in adjacent ditches, but its indirect effects on OM composition and its inherent consequences for ecosystem functioning remain uncertain. This study determined the effect of agricultural practices (dairy farm grasslands and hyacinth bulb fields) on OM degradation by microorganisms and invertebrates with a consumption and food preference experiment {{in the field and}} in the laboratory using natural OM collected from the field. Freshly cut grass and hyacinths were also offered to control for OM composition and large- and small mesh-sizes were used to distinguish microbial decomposition and invertebrate consumption. Results show that OM decomposition by microorganisms and consumption by invertebrates was similar throughout the study area, but that OM collected <b>from</b> <b>ditches</b> adjacent grasslands and freshly cut grass and hyacinths were preferred over OM collected <b>from</b> <b>ditches</b> adjacent to a hyacinth bulb field. In the case of OM collected <b>from</b> <b>ditches</b> adjacent hyacinth bulb fields, both microbial decomposition and invertebrate consumption were strongly retarded, likely resulting from sorption and accumulation of pesticides. This outcome illustrates that differences in agricultural practices can, in addition to direct detrimental effects on aquatic organisms, indirectly alter the functioning of adjacent aquatic ecosystems...|$|R
