5|$|Charles Enderlin {{was born}} in 1945 in Paris; his {{grandparents}} were Austrian Jews who had left the country in 1938 when Germany invaded. After briefly studying medicine, he moved to Jerusalem in 1968 where he became an Israeli national. He began working for France2 in 1981, serving as their bureau chief in <b>Israel</b> <b>from</b> 1990 {{until his retirement in}} 2015. Enderlin is {{the author of several books}} about the Middle East, including one about Muhammad al-Durrah, Un Enfant est Mort: Netzarim, 30 Septembre 2000 (2010). Highly regarded among his peers and within the French establishment, he submitted a letter from Jacques Chirac, during the Philippe Karsenty libel action, who wrote in flattering terms of Enderlin's integrity. In 2009 he was awarded France's highest decoration, the Légion d'honneur.|$|E
5|$|Hezbollah {{says that}} its {{continued}} hostilities against Israel are justified as reciprocal to Israeli operations against Lebanon and as retaliation {{for what they}} claim is Israel's occupation of Lebanese territory. Israel withdrew from Lebanon in 2000, and their withdrawal was verified by the United Nations as being in accordance with resolution 425 of 19 March 1978, however Lebanon considers the Shebaa farms—a 26-km² (10-mi²) piece of land captured by <b>Israel</b> <b>from</b> Syria in the 1967 war and considered by the UN to be Syrian territory occupied by Israel—to be Lebanese territory. Additionally, Hezbollah claims that three Lebanese prisoners are being held in Israel. Finally, Hezbollah consider Israel to be an illegitimate state. For these reasons, they justify their actions as acts of defensive jihad.|$|E
5|$|Israeli {{salad is}} {{typically}} made with finely chopped tomatoes and cucumbers dressed in olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper. Variations include {{the addition of}} diced red or green bell peppers, grated carrot, finely shredded cabbage or lettuce, sliced radish, fennel, spring onions and chives, chopped parsley, or other herbs and spices such as mint, za'atar and sumac. Although popularized by the kibbutzim, versions of this mixed salad were brought to <b>Israel</b> <b>from</b> various places. For example, Jews from India prepare it with finely chopped ginger and green chili peppers, North African Jews may add preserved lemon peel and cayenne pepper, and Bukharan Jews chop the vegetables extremely finely and use vinegar, without oil, in the dressing.|$|E

5|$|Palestinian groups used to {{initiate}} few attacks on Israeli targets {{from both the}} West Bank and Jordan before the Six-Day War, some of which caused Israel to retaliate which {{became known as the}} Reprisal operations. Following the seizure of the West Bank from Jordan in the June 1967 Six-Day War, Israel destroyed the existing Palestinian group Fatah networks there. In early 1968, however, Fatah guerrillas began raiding <b>Israel</b> <b>from</b> bases on the Jordanian side of the river. Most of these attacks were blocked by the Israel Defense Forces. At times, Jordanian Army infantry and artillery units gave the Fatah squads covering fire, leading to frequent direct skirmishes between the IDF and the Jordanian Army.|$|E
5|$|The Eshmun Temple was {{improved}} {{during the}} early Roman Empire with a colonnade street, but declined after earthquakes and fell into oblivion as Christianity replaced paganism and its large limestone blocks were used to build later structures. The temple site was rediscovered in 1900 by local treasure hunters who stirred the curiosity of international scholars. Maurice Dunand, a French archaeologist, thoroughly excavated the site from 1963 {{until the beginning of}} the Lebanese Civil War in 1975. After the end of the hostilities and the retreat of <b>Israel</b> <b>from</b> Southern Lebanon, the site was rehabilitated and inscribed to the World Heritage Site tentative list.|$|E

There is now a local style with a wide selection of cakes and pastries that includes influences from other cuisines and combines traditional European ingredients with Mediterranean and Middle Eastern ingredients, such as halva, phyllo dough, dates, and rose water.|$|E

5|$|Ashdod {{has seen}} {{much of its}} growth {{as the result of}} {{absorption}} of immigrants. The first settlers were Jewish immigrants from Morocco and Egypt. In the 1960s Ashdod accepted a large number of immigrants from Romania, followed by a large number from Georgia (then part of the Soviet Union) in the 1970s. More than 60,000 Russian Jews from the former Soviet Union who immigrated to Israel in the 1990s following the collapse of the Soviet Union settled in Ashdod. Recent demographic figures suggest that about 32% of the city's population are new immigrants, 85% of whom are originally from the former Soviet Union. During the 1990s the city absorbed a large number of Beta Israel immigrants from Ethiopia, and in more recent years Ashdod absorbed a large number of immigrants from the United States, United Kingdom, France, Argentina, and South Africa. Many of the 60,000 Marathi-speaking Bene <b>Israel</b> <b>from</b> Maharashtra, India who moved to Israel also settled there. Ashdod also receives a significant amount of internal migration, especially from the Gush Dan region.|$|E
5|$|By October 6 the Egyptian naval {{task force}} was at Bab-el-Mandeb where they broke radio silence. When Operation Badr began at 14:00, Rear Admiral Fuad Abu Zikry {{authorized}} the fleet {{to proceed with}} the blockade via a codeword. Egyptian submarines and destroyers intercepted ships traveling through Bab-el-Mandeb destined for Eilat, and all Israeli maritime navigation in the Red Sea ceased. The blockade was a strategic success for Egypt, while the Israeli Navy and Air Force were incapable of lifting the blockade due to the long distance between Israel and Bab-el-Mandeb. Mines were laid {{at the entrance to the}} Gulf of Suez to prevent <b>Israel</b> <b>from</b> transporting oil from the Sinai fields to Eilat. Historian Gammal Hammad claims that a blockade was also enforced in the Mediterranean, while other sources dispute this. News of the blockade was censored in Israel.|$|E
5|$|Emerging {{from among}} the Palestinian {{refugees}} who fled or were expelled from their villages {{as a result of}} the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, in the mid-1950s the fedayeen began mounting cross-border operations into <b>Israel</b> <b>from</b> Syria, Egypt and Jordan. The earliest infiltrations were often to access the lands agricultural products they had lost {{as a result of the}} war, or to attack Israeli military, and sometimes civilian targets. The Gaza Strip, the sole territory of the All-Palestine Protectorate—an Palestinian state declared in October 1948, became the focal point of the Palestinian fedayeen activity. Fedayeen attacks were directed on Gaza and Sinai borders with Israel, and as a result Israel undertook retaliatory actions, targeting the fedayeen that also often targeted the citizens of their host countries, which in turn provoked more attacks.|$|E

5|$|It is {{estimated}} that there were 1,800 Jews in Albania {{at the end of}} the Second World War, eleven times the number of Jews that were living in the country in 1939. The Jewish community in Kosovo never fully recovered from the war. Few Jews remained in Kosovo and many emigrated to Israel during the communist period. Similarly, most Jews in Albania decided to emigrate following the communist takeover. About 300 remained in the country until the early 1990s. The official Albanian census of April 1989 recorded 73 Jews living in the country. With the fall of Communism, Albania eased restrictions on religion and foreign travel, which resulted in virtually the entire Jewish community of the country emigrating to <b>Israel.</b> <b>From</b> December 1990 to June 1991, 350 Albanian Jews were airlifted from Albania to Israel in what was codenamed Operation Flying Carpet. Most of Albania's 60 remaining Jews left in 1997, after the country became engulfed in a brief civil war.|$|E
