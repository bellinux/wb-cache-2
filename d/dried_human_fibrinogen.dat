40|$|A GROWING INTEREST in fibrinolytic agents {{has given}} rise to a variety of methods for {{assessing}} the activity of such agents in vitro. The fibrin plate assay 1 is a useful technic employing the natural substrate. Other methods, 2 using formed fibrin clots, have also been devised, as well as tech-nics employing other substrates such as casein. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the possibility of measuring fibrinolytic activity by the change in turbidity resulting from the dissolution of suspended particles of fibrin under the influence of fibrinolytic enzymes. METHOD In this work, fibrin of either human or bovine origin was used as the substrate. How-ever, fibrin from any source may be used if desired.

Aim: Compare pediatric liver transplants with ex-situ liver transection (reduction or split) with or without the <b>human</b> <b>fibrinogen</b> and thrombin sponge. Methods: Was performed a prospective analysis of 21 patients submitted to liver transplantation with ex-situ liver transection with the application of the <b>human</b> <b>fibrinogen</b> and thrombin sponge in the wound area (group A) and retrospective analysis of 59 patients without the sponge (group B).

40|$|Introduction Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) frequently {{involves the}} loss of tolerance to citrullinated antigens, which {{may play a role}} in pathogenicity. Citrullinated fibrinogen is commonly found in inflamed synovial tissue and is a frequent target of autoantibodies in RA patients. To obtain insight into the B-cell response to citrullinated fibrinogen in RA, its autoepitopes were systematically mapped using a new methodology. Methods <b>Human</b> <b>fibrinogen</b> was citrullinated in vitro by peptidylarginine deiminases (PAD), subjected to proteolysis and the resulting peptides were fractionated by ion exchange chromatography. The peptide composition of the citrullinated peptide-containing fractions was determined by high resolution tandem mass spectrometry. The recognition of these fractions by patient sera was subsequently analyzed by imaging surface plasmon resonance on microarrays. Results In total about two-thirds of the 81 arginines of <b>human</b> <b>fibrinogen</b> were found to be susceptible to citrullination by the human PAD 2, the human PAD 4 or the rabbit PAD 2 enzymes. Citrullination sites were found in all three polypeptide chains of fibrinogen, although the α-chain appeared to contain most of them. The analysis of 98 anti-citrullinated protein antibody-positive RA sera using the new methodology allowed the identification of three major citrullinated epitope regions in <b>human</b> <b>fibrinogen,</b> two in the α- and one in the β-chain. Conclusions A comprehensive overview of citrullination sites in <b>human</b> <b>fibrinogen</b> was generated. The multiplex analysis of peptide fractions derived from a post-translationally modified protein, characterized by mass spectrometry, with patient sera provides a versatile system for mapping modified amino acid-containing epitopes. The citrullinated epitopes of <b>human</b> <b>fibrinogen</b> most efficiently recognized by RA autoantibodies are confined to three regions of its polypeptides...|$|R
40|$|Staphylocoagulases of Staphylococcus aureus (40 strains {{originally}} {{isolated from}} horses, dogs, cats, cows, sheep, opossums, pigs, humans, and a goat) and Staphylococcus intermedius (19 isolates from dogs and 1 pigeon strain) were tested for their affinity to prothrombins of either bovine or human origin. The tests used were the coagulase tube test (using human, bovine, or equine fibrinogen with either bovine or human prothrombim {{as the source}} of coagulase-reacting factor) and a chromogenic assay which enabled quantification of the amidolytic activity of the staphylocoagulase-prothrombin complex. S. intermedius showed weak specificity for human prothrombin, with 15 % of the coagulases clotting <b>human</b> <b>fibrinogen,</b> 25 % clotting equine fibrinogen, and 40 % clotting bovine fibrinogen. However, 65 % of coagulases clotted equine fibrinogen, 75 % of coagulases clotted <b>human</b> <b>fibrinogen,</b> and 100 % of coagulases clotted bovine fibrinogen when bovine prothrombin was used. The animal isolates of S. aureus displayed more diverse specificity toward prothrombin than S. intermedius strains.

40|$|The {{ability of}} 111 Streptococcus agalactiae strains to bind to <b>human</b> <b>fibrinogen</b> was quantified. We {{correlated}} {{the percentages of}} bacteria that bound to immobilized fibrinogen with fibrinogen-binding (fbs) gene characteristics of strains and with clinical origin, serotypes, and phylogenetic positions of strains. Percentages varied from 0. 4 to 29. 9 %. Fifty-five strains (49. 5 %) had the fbsB gene sensu stricto described by Gutekunst et al. (Infect. Immun., 72 : 3495 - 3504, 2004), allowing adhesion to <b>human</b> <b>fibrinogen,</b> {{and all of the}} other strains had an fgag variant gene. Ninety strains (81. 1 %) had a fbsA gene and 55 of them also had the fbsB gene. The other 21 strains (18. 9 %) had a truncated form of fbsA without the fbsB gene sensu stricto. The numbers of 48 -nucleotide repeat sequences (rs) in the fbsA gene varied from 2 to 26. The population of strains with the highest ability to bind to <b>human</b> <b>fibrinogen</b> significantly more frequently had the fbsB gene sensu stricto and 4 to 7 rs in the fbsA gene (P < 0. 05). However, the single strain that carried the highest number of rs (26 rs) in the fbsA gene showed high fibrinogen-binding activity (24. 3 %). Strains exhibiting significantly higher levels of binding to <b>human</b> <b>fibrinogen</b> belonged to a phylogenetic group of strains associated with neonatal meningitis, currently known as the ST- 17 clone, that is mostly composed of serotype III strains. These findings indicate that S. agalactiae strains possess a wide variety of fbs gene content that markedly influences the ability of strains to bind to <b>human</b> <b>fibrinogen.</b> Variations in the configuration and the expression of the Fbs proteins may therefore partly explain the variability of virulence in S. agalactiae species...|$|R

40|$|Background: Cardiac surgery using {{cardiopulmonary}} bypass is {{a complex}} procedure, sometimes accompanied with excessive bleeding. The nature and pathophysiology of this bleeding is multifactorial and not completely understood. Fibrinogen is a final step in the coagulation cascade and its substitution can alter postoperative hemorrhage. Aims: To investigate different aspects of plasma coagulation in cardiac surgery. Firstly, to assess potential changes in coagulation factor levels during surgery {{and its relation to}} bleeding. Secondly, to study plasma’s potential to generate thrombin postoperatively. Thirdly, to compare two different regiments to dose anticoagulant heparin in regard to thrombin building capacity. Fourthly, to investigate effects of recombinant <b>human</b> <b>fibrinogen</b> ex vivo. Material and methods: In study I, coagulation factor activities were measured before and after surgery in a cohort of 57 patients undergoing first time elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). Study II comprises the same cohort, now measuring thrombin generation potential using calibrated automated thrombography (CAT). Study III is a prospective trial, randomizing 60 elective CABG patients to either anticoagulation with weight-based heparin dosing or using heparin and protamine titration with a bedside device. In study IV, plasma of 10 cardiac surgery patients was spiked with various concentrations of <b>human</b> plasma derived <b>fibrinogen</b> or recombinant <b>human</b> <b>fibrinogen.</b> Ex vivo clot formation was assessed by rotational thromboelastometry. Results: There is pronounced variation in level of individual coagulation factors after surgery. Concentration of fibrinogen and FXIII showed a weak correlation to bleeding volume 12 hours post surgery. Pronounced deterioration of thrombin generation capacity was found, possibly caused by persistent heparin effect and/or heparin rebound. Different heparin dosing regiments had no effect on per- and postoperative plasma’s thrombin generation capacity or on bleeding volume. Ex vivo, there is no difference between the new recombinant <b>human</b> <b>fibrinogen</b> concentrate and the one plasma derived regarding clot formation ability. Conclusions: Postoperative decline (or rise) of individual coagulation factors does not seem to affect the postoperative bleeding volume, with reservation for fibrinogen and FXIII. Heparin effect is still present at 2 and 4 hours after surgery, affecting thrombin generation. More precise heparin and protamin dosing does not influence this phenomenon.

METHODS: A three-dimensional (3 D) molecular model of <b>human</b> <b>fibrinogen</b> receptor GPIIb-IIIa was generated by InsightII, a distance geometry-based homologous modeling package. The structure of <b>human</b> <b>fibrinogen</b> receptor GPIIb-IIIa was built by the InsightII/Homology module using the corresponding of integrin alphaVbeta 3 (PDB filecode 1 JV 2) as the template. Then the primary structures were optimized by energy minimization. Subsequently the structural model was docked with its antagonist decorsin (PDB filecode 1 dec). RESULTS: A good substratereceptor interaction model was achieved. The interaction sites with decorsin converge at domain 8 (βA domain of β 3 subunit) of GPIIb-IIIa. The direct interatomic contacts were made between 16 GPIIb/IIIa residues and 10 decorsin amino-acid residues. These included van der Waals contacts, electrostatic interaction, hydrogen bond, and salt bridge. Residues in contact were concentrated in four dispersed regions of human GPIIb-IIIa: the RGD reaction motif (118 - 132 of GPIIIa), the span from 210 to 213 of GPIIIa, Thr 182 residue and Asp 251 residue of GPIIIa; and they were distributed over five segments of decorsin: Asp 10 residue, Asn 18 and Lys 19 residues, Arg 28 residue, RGD motif, and Asp 35 -Pro 36 -Tyr 37 segment.

Methods: Patients undergoing elective aortic surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass {{were randomly assigned}} to receive FCH or placebo. Study medication was administered to patients with a 5 min bleeding mass of 60 - 250 g after separation from bypass and surgical haemostasis. A standardized algorithm for allogeneic blood product transfusion was followed if bleeding continued after study medication. Results: 519 patients from 34 centres were randomized, of whom 152 (29 %) met inclusion criteria for study medication. Median (IQR) pretreatment 5 min bleeding mass was 107 (76 - 138) and 91 (71 - 112) g in the FCH and placebo groups, respectively (P= 0. 13). More allogeneic blood product units were administered during the first 24 h after FCH, 5. 0 (2. 0 - 11. 0), when compared with placebo, 3. 0 (0. 0 - 7. 0), P= 0. 026. Fewer patients avoided transfusion in the FCH group (15. 4 %) compared with placebo (28. 4 %), P= 0. 047. The FCH immediately increased plasma fibrinogen concentration and fibrin-based clot strength.

The aim of the current study was to analyse potential virulence factors of B. fragilis, by investigating the contribution of three genes putatively involved in capsule biosynthesis, and by examination of fibrinogen binding and degradation. A novel plasmid DNA transformation protocol exploiting the anti restrictive property of Ocr protein was developed which allowed for the transformation of wild-type and mutant B. fragilis NCTC 9343 strains. The current study is the first report of successful DNA transformation in strain NCTC 9343 by electroporation. B. jfragilis is capable of within-strain variable expression of micro, small, and large capsules. Data presented herein indicate that the putative transcriptional regulator, upcY, is necessary for expression of the micro capsule polysaccharide biosynthesis locus, PS C/ 8, the putative wzz-like capsular polysaccharide processing gene, Bf 1708, is required for micro capsule biosynthesis, and the putative glycosyltransferase, Bj 2782, is necessary for large capsule expression. DNA inversion of the Bj 2782 promoter was shown to regulate large capsule production in strain NCTC 9343. Fibrinogen is the structural protein used in fibrin abscess formation, a pathological host response to B. ji-agilis intra-abdominal infections.

Rat or human LDL or <b>human</b> <b>fibrinogen</b> was injected i. v. 5 {{days after the}} start of infusion, and 24 hr later the radioactivity of aortic walls was determined. Body weight was almost constant in control rats and moderately decreased in a dose-dependent way by angiotensin II. Diastolic blood pressure decreased slightly over 6 days in control rats and increased transiently at the lowest dose of angiotensin II and progressively with two higher concentrations. All three angiotensin II concentrations significantly increased the uptake of rat and human LDL and of fibrinogen by aorta. The increase was dose related for rat LDL but not for <b>human</b> LDL or <b>fibrinogen.</b> In spontaneously hypertensive rats of the same age in which blood pressure was higher than in angiotensin II-infused rats, protein uptakes were not increased. The blood content of aortic walls was negligible and not altered by angiotensin II. Therefore, the uptake of atherogenic plasma proteins by rat aorta is increased by angiotensin II, but this effect may be independent of its pressor action...|$|R

Gov'tCopyright © 2013 American Chemical SocietyLectin binding {{has been}} studied using the {{particle}} plasmon light-scattering properties of gold nanoparticles printed into an array format. Performance of the kinetic assay is evaluated from {{a detailed analysis of}} the binding of concanavalin A (ConA) and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) to their target monosaccharides indicating affinity constants in the order of KD ∼ 10 nM for the lectin-monosaccharide interaction. The detection limits for the lectins following a 200 s injection time were determined as 10 ng/mL or 0. 23 nM and 100 ng/mL or 0. 93 nM, respectively. Subsequently, a nine-lectin screen was performed on the porcine and <b>human</b> <b>fibrinogen</b> glycoproteins. The observed spectra of lectin-protein specific binding rates result in characteristic patterns that evidently correlate with the structure of the glycans and allow one to distinguish between glycosylation of the porcine and <b>human</b> <b>fibrinogens.</b> The array technology has the potential to perform a multilectin screen of large numbers of proteins providing information on protein glycosylation and their microheterogeneity.
