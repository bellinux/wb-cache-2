5|$|Dead Island, {{originally}} {{announced in}} 2007 by Techland, is an action role-playing survival horror video game. Set in a zombie-infested tropical island called Banoi, the game focuses heavily on melee combat. According to Techland, {{it was a}} game about killing zombies, not a game focused on delivering an <b>emotional</b> <b>experience.</b> Until 2011, Techland declined to give new information regarding the game as requested by the game's publisher, Deep Silver. With the lack of new information surrounding the game, many critics believed that the game had been quietly cancelled. The game was released on February 16, 2011, approximately four years after the game's initial announcement.|$|E
25|$|The insular cortex, in {{particular}} its most anterior portion, {{is considered a}} limbic-related cortex. The insula has increasingly {{become the focus of}} attention for its role in body representation and subjective <b>emotional</b> <b>experience.</b> In particular, Antonio Damasio has proposed that this region plays a role in mapping visceral states that are associated with <b>emotional</b> <b>experience,</b> giving rise to conscious feelings. This is in essence a neurobiological formulation of the ideas of William James, who first proposed that subjective <b>emotional</b> <b>experience</b> (i.e., feelings) arise from our brain's interpretation of bodily states that are elicited by emotional events. This is an example of embodied cognition.|$|E

40|$|Orientation: The {{positive}} organisational behaviour movement emphasises {{the advantages}} of psychological strengths in business. The psychological virtues of positive <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences</b> can potentially promote human strengths to {{the advantages of}} business functioning and the management of work conditions. This is supported by Fredrickson’s broaden-and-build theory that emphasises the broadening of reactive thought patterns through experiences of positive emotions. Research purpose: A preliminary psychometric evaluation of a positive measurement of dimensions of <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences</b> in the workplace, by rephrasing the Kiefer and Barclay Toxic <b>Emotional</b> <b>Experiences</b> Scale. Motivation for the study: This quantitative Exploratory Factor Analysis investigates the factorial structure and reliability of the Positive <b>Emotional</b> <b>Experiences</b> Scale, a positive rephrased version of the Toxic <b>Emotional</b> <b>Experiences</b> Scale. Research approach, design and method: This Exploratory Factor Analysis indicates an acceptable three-factor model for the Positive <b>Emotional</b> <b>Experiences</b> Scale. These three factors are: (1) psychological recurrent positive state, (2) social connectedness and (3) physical refreshed energy, with strong Cronbach’s alphas of 0. 91, 0. 91 and 0. 94, respectively. Main findings: The three-factor model of the Positive <b>Emotional</b> <b>Experiences</b> Scale provides a valid measure in support of Fredrickson’s theory of social, physical and psychological endured personal resources that build positive emotions. Practical/Managerial implications: Knowledge gained on positive versus negative <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences</b> could be applied by management to promote endured personal resources that strengthen positive <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences.</b> Contribution/value-add: The contribution of this rephrased Positive <b>Emotional</b> <b>Experiences</b> Scale provides a reliable measure of assessment of the social, physical and endured psychological and personal resources identified in Fredrickson’s broaden-and-build theory. Application of this Positive <b>Emotional</b> <b>Experiences</b> Scale as a diagnostic tool may allow businesses to work towards more positive <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences</b> in the workplace. </p...|$|R

The participants' <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences</b> are: satisfaction, disappointment, hope, fear, joy, distress, boredom, interest, pride, reproach, self-reproach, like and dislike with different eliciting conditions. These results show that all students' <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences</b> are based on their appraisal in terms of a goal structure present in the mathematics classroom and in the school setting...|$|R
25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that in certain {{situations}} people share personal or emotional information with non-intimate others, data shows that the target of the social sharing is usually a close relative or an intimate other, about 85% of the time. However, a paradox arises when considering the secondary social sharing of emotions; on the one hand, socially sharing an <b>emotional</b> <b>experience</b> with an intimate other presupposes confidentiality, yet in the majority of cases those experiences become the subject of secondary sharing to other people.|$|E

25|$|In 1954 Leon Festinger, a {{well known}} social psychologist, {{presented}} his influential social comparison theory, which proposes that people seek to obtain accurate self-evaluations by comparing themselves to similar others. Furthermore, people turn to their social environment {{to search for}} clarification when faced with obscure or confusing environmental situations or sensations. Thus extending this theory to emotions would posit that after experiencing emotional situations that {{do not conform to}} held expectations or that are ambiguous, one would be expected to later share that <b>emotional</b> <b>experience</b> with others.|$|E

5000|$|Through {{the use of}} multidimensional scaling, psychologists can map out similar <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences,</b> {{which allows}} a visual {{depiction}} of the [...] "emotional distance" [...] between experiences. A further step can be taken {{by looking at the}} map's dimensions of the <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences.</b> The <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences</b> are divided into two dimensions known as valence (how negative or positive the experience feels) and arousal (how energized or enervated the experience feels). These two dimensions can be depicted on a 2D coordinate map. This two-dimensional map was theorized to capture one important component of emotion called core affect. [...] Core affect is not the only component to emotion, but gives the emotion its hedonic and felt energy.|$|R
40|$|Patient care evokes {{emotional}} responses such as uncertainty, grief {{and pride in}} medical students. There {{is a need for}} opportunities to share and express such emotions because they influence students' professional development and well-being. There is a trend towards introducing mentor programmes into medical curricula. It remains unknown whether students are willing and able to share their <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences</b> within this formal setting. We set out to explore how medical students share their <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences</b> and why. We used thematic analysis, including purposeful sampling, parallel processes of data collection and constant comparative analysis, maintaining an audit trail for validation purposes. The study had a constructivist, interactional design and used Goffman's dramaturgical theory as an interpretive framework. Nineteen students participated in individual, semi-structured interviews. Participants' narratives revealed a preference for sharing <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences</b> away from people who might expect them to uphold formal behaviour. They deliberately decided with whom to share their <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences.</b> Participants had a preference to talk to fellow students working in the same department, or family and friends outside medical school. Participants found it difficult to uphold behaviours that they thought patients, preceptors or the organisation expected of them as future doctors. In adjusting their behaviour to meet those expectations, they became attuned to how to best present themselves based on the people present. This influenced how they chose which <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences</b> to share with who...|$|R
25|$|From {{the above}} {{evidence}} {{it can be}} concluded that exposure to the social sharing of an emotion is itself an emotion-eliciting event, it would follow that the listener too would later share that experience with other people. Christophe et Rimé called this subsequent phenomenon secondary social sharing of emotions. In other words, the receiver of the social sharing will consequently experience some kind of emotion, so the receiver will then become a transmitter of the narration as a part of their <b>emotional</b> <b>experience</b> of hearing the story.|$|E
25|$|Much of Magnétophone's {{music from}} the early singles to the first LP is notable for its 'challenging' nature (the pounding, broken, {{distorted}} beats and unrecognisable bass textures of 'I Hear Blonde Falcons' being a case-in-point), {{and it is clear}} that the band at this stage were often concerned with creating original audio 'objects' that have questionable worth outside of pure abstract appreciation; other tracks from this time more clearly reference rock'n'roll's more simple appeal, and the balancing of these two ethics across a record creates a unique and unsettling audio and <b>emotional</b> <b>experience.</b>|$|E
25|$|The amygdaloid complex {{helps us}} {{interpret}} <b>emotional</b> <b>experience</b> and act appropriately. This {{is conducive to}} directing the individual's attention to the most pertinent stimuli in a potentially dangerous situation so that the individual can take self-protective measures. Proper amygdaloid complex function requires input from the thalamus, which creates a thalamoamygdala pathway capable of bypassing the intense scrutiny of incoming stimuli to enable quick responses in a potentially life-threatening situation. Typically, situations assessed as non-threatening are disregarded. In sleep paralysis, however, those pathways can become over-excited and move {{into a state of}} hyper-vigilance in which the mind perceives every external stimulus as a threat.|$|E
40|$|While {{numerous}} {{studies have examined the}} relationships between facial actions and emotions, they have yet to account for the ways that specific spontaneous facial expressions map onto <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences</b> induced without expressive intent. Moreover, previous studies emphasized that a fine-grained investigation of facial components could establish the coherence of facial actions with actual internal states. Therefore, this study aimed to accumulate evidence for the correspondence between spontaneous facial components and <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences.</b> We reinvestigated data from previous research which secretly recorded spontaneous facial expressions of Japanese participants as they watched film clips designed to evoke four different target emotions: surprise, amusement, disgust, and sadness. The participants rated their <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences</b> via a self-reported questionnaire of 16 emotions. These spontaneous facial expressions were coded using the Facial Action Coding System, the gold standard for classifying visible facial movements. We corroborated each facial action that was present in the <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences</b> by applying stepwise regression models. The results found that spontaneous facial components occurred in ways that cohere to their evolutionary functions based on the rating values of <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences</b> (e. g., the inner brow raiser might be involved in the evaluation of novelty). This study provided new empirical evidence for the correspondence between each spontaneous facial component and first-person internal states of emotion as reported by the expresser...|$|R

25|$|The {{specific}} pathway {{through which}} the threat-activated vigilance system acts is not well understood. One possibility is that the thalamus receives sensory information and sends it on the amygdala, which regulates <b>emotional</b> <b>experience.</b> Another is that the amygdaloid complex, anterior cingulate, and the structures in the pontine tegmentum interact to create the vision. It is also highly possible that SP hallucinations could result {{from a combination of}} these. The anterior cingulate has an extensive array of cortical connections to other cortical areas, which enables it to integrate the various sensations and emotions into the unified sensorium we experience.|$|E
25|$|One {{study found}} that introverts have more blood flow in the frontal lobes of their brain and the {{anterior}} or frontal thalamus, which are areas dealing with internal processing, such as planning and problem solving. Extraverts have more blood flow in the anterior cingulate gyrus, temporal lobes, and posterior thalamus, which are involved in sensory and <b>emotional</b> <b>experience.</b> This study and other research indicates that introversion-extraversion is related to individual differences in brain function. A study on regional brain volume found {{a positive correlation between}} introversion and grey matter volume in the right prefrontal cortex and right temporoparietal junction, as well as a positive correlation between introversion and total white matter volume.|$|E
25|$|From the Renaissance on, some {{individuals}} wanted {{not only to}} record events, as in medieval chronicles and itineraries, but also to put down their own opinions and express their hopes and fears, without any intention to publish these notes. One of the early preserved examples is the anonymous Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris that covers the years 1405–49, giving subjective commentaries on the current events. Famous 14th- to 16th-century Renaissance examples, which appeared much later as books, were the diaries by the Florentines Buonaccorso Pitti and Gregorio Dati and the Venetian Marino Sanuto the Younger. Here we find records of even less important everyday occurrences together with much reflection, <b>emotional</b> <b>experience</b> and personal impressions.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} developments in the theory of emotions has been the perceptual model. Supporters of this model maintain that <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences</b> represent evaluative properties, {{in much the same way}} that perceptual experiences represent non-evaluative properties. Because of this, supporters of the perceptual model hold that <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences</b> can play a similar epistemic role to that played by perceptual experiences: they can constitute justifying reasons with respect to beliefs or judgements. In this paper I want to raise some doubts about this picture of the epistemic role of <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences,</b> doubts which are grounded in a significant disanalogy between emotions and perceptions. In the first section of the paper I outline the perceptual model of emotion. In the second and third parts I raise some problems for the account, suggesting that emotions are not themselves reasons for evaluative judgements. And in the final part of the paper I respond to a possible objection, and explain how <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences</b> can still play a role in the justification of our evaluative judgements even if they are not reasons for those judgements...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the hypothesis that}} cognitive reappraisal is ineffective {{for people who have}} either a low sense of independence or a high sense of interdependence.

The respondents were 314 students, who completed scales aessing cultural self-construal (independence and interdependence) ，use of cognitive reappraisal and suppression，and daily <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences.</b> The results indicate that the use of cognitive reappraisalis negatively related to daily experiences of negative emotions only for interindependent individuals. Furthermore，there is support for a model that includes both processes where cultural self-construal is directly associated with <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences</b> and processes that are mediated by the use of emotion regulation strategies. These findings suggest two possibilities; the first is that daily use of cognitive reappraisal is effective regardless of cultural self-construal and the second is that the relations between cultural self-construal and <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences</b> can be partly explained by the use of emotion regulation strategies...|$|R
