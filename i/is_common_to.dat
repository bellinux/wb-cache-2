5|$|A Markov {{chain is}} a type of Markov process that has either {{discrete}} state space or discrete index set (often representing time), but the precise definition of a Markov chain varies. For example, it <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>to</b> define a Markov chain as a Markov process in either discrete or continuous time with a countable state space (thus regardless of the nature of time), but it is also common to define a Markov chain as having discrete time in either countable or continuous state space (thus regardless of the state space).|$|E

5|$|Another common {{condition}} is otitis externa (outer ear infections), which <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>to</b> {{a variety of}} spaniels, as the long floppy ears trap moisture, making them more prone to recurrent infections than dogs with more upright ears. The infections {{can be caused by}} a variety of reasons including mites, ear fungi and generally dirt and germs. Treatment is relatively simple and can range from prescribed antibiotics to over-the-counter ear cleaning liquids.|$|E

The Cadet Program Update (CPU) brings new teaching materials and incorporates more contemporary educational and youth development methods. Similar updates to the Sea and Army Cadet programs rationalize the connectivity between the three programs and more efficiently provides the training that <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>to</b> all three elements.|$|E

As in the other poems of the Four Quartets, each of the five sections holds a theme that <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>to</b> each of the poems: time, experience, purgation, prayer, and wholeness. The time theme is stated in the first section as 'In my beginning is my end' which, given proper attention, might prove to lead into the eternal moment.|$|E

5|$|Genetic {{recombination}} is {{the process}} by which a strand of DNA is broken and then joined {{to the end of a}} different DNA molecule. This can occur when viruses infect cells simultaneously and studies of viral evolution have shown that recombination has been rampant in the species studied. Recombination <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>to</b> both RNA and DNA viruses.|$|E
5|$|In The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life, Durkheim's first {{purpose was}} to {{identify}} the social origin and function of religion as he felt that religion {{was a source of}} camaraderie and solidarity. His second {{purpose was to}} identify links between certain religions in different cultures, finding a common denominator. He wanted to understand the empirical, social aspect of religion that <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>to</b> all religions and goes beyond the concepts of spirituality and God.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the calculation of association, it <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>to</b> take into account any variables that could potentially confound the results. Sex and age are common examples of confounding variables. Moreover, it is also known that many genetic variations {{are associated with the}} geographical and historical populations in which the mutations first arose. Because of this association, studies must take account of the geographical and ethnical background of participants by controlling for what is called population stratification.|$|E

5|$|In chess a minor {{material}} advantage is important as when material gets exchanged, the relative advantage becomes larger. Because new pieces come in, {{there is no}} endgame play in bughouse and material is therefore less important. It <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>to</b> sacrifice pieces in bughouse while attacking, defending or hunting down a certain piece which the partner requires.|$|E
5|$|In {{tetrapod}}s, {{the thyroid}} is always found {{somewhere in the}} neck region. In most tetrapod species, there are two paired thyroid glands – that is, {{the right and left}} lobes are not joined together. However, there is only ever a single thyroid gland in most mammals, and the shape found in humans <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>to</b> many other species.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>to</b> {{reduce a}} wood sample {{to just the}} {{cellulose}} component before testing, but since this can reduce {{the volume of the}} sample to 20% of its original size, testing of the whole wood is often performed as well. Charcoal is often tested but is likely to need treatment to remove contaminants.|$|E

5|$|Just {{like the}} many uses of plasma, {{there are several}} means for its generation, however, one {{principle}} <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>to</b> all of them: there must be energy input to produce and sustain it. For this case, plasma is generated when an electric current is applied across a dielectric gas or fluid (an electrically non-conducting material) {{as can be seen}} in the adjacent image, which shows a discharge tube as a simple example (DC used for simplicity).|$|E
5|$|Python's name {{is derived}} from the {{television}} series Monty Python's Flying Circus, and it <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>to</b> use Monty Python references in example code.

Also, the official Python documentation and many code examples often contain various obscure Monty Python references.|$|E
5|$|Supplemental testing {{provides}} extra {{information on}} some {{features of the}} disease or is used to rule out other diagnoses.

(It is also necessary to rule out delirium).|$|E

5|$|The Pamphylia plain {{between the}} sea and the {{mountains}} is an isolated example of an Eastern Mediterranean conifer-sclerophyllous-broadleaf forest, which include Lebanon Cedar, evergreen scrub, fig trees, and black pine. The Alanya Massif refers to the area of metamorphic rocks east of Antalya. This formation is divided into three nappes from lowest to highest, the Mahmutlar, the Sugözü, and the Yumrudağ. The similar lithology extends beneath the city in a tectonic window. Bauxite, an aluminum ore, <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>to</b> the area north of city, and can be mined.|$|E
5|$|The most {{competitive}} undergraduate programs are Medicine with a 0.5% acceptance rate, Architecture and Urbanism with 0.6%, and Communication with 2%. Such high competitivity leads many {{students to take}} preparatory courses during or after the last regular high school year called cursinhos in Portuguese, generally privately offered or managed by some association or organization. Many private cursinhos have special classes focused on highly competitive programs like medicine, making them very expensive. It <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>to</b> find students admitted in Medicine, Engineering and other programs {{after several years of}} preparatory courses.|$|E
