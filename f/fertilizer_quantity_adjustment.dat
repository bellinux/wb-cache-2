40|$|A {{dominant}} {{explanation of}} price rigidity {{is the so-called}} "menu cost model" according to which small costs of changing prices may imply that firms keep nominal prices unchanged to nominal shocks which therefore have real effects. Crucial to this explanation {{is the assumption that}} price adjustment is costly while <b>quantity</b> <b>adjustment</b> is not. This paper analyses the role of costs of adjusting both prices and quantities, and it is found that the "small cost" argument used to support menu cost models does not hold. The predictions of menu cost models only hold if price adjustment costs are larger than <b>quantity</b> <b>adjustment</b> costs. Empirical evidence clearly indicates that the costs of adjusting quantities are non-trivial. <b>Quantity</b> <b>adjustment</b> costs also open for the possibility of non-market clearing.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{continuous}} time price and <b>quantity</b> <b>adjustment</b> process is considered for an economy facing price rigidities. In {{the short run}} prices {{are assumed to be}} completely fixed and the markets are cleared by <b>quantity</b> <b>adjustments</b> until a fixed price equilibrium is reached where every market is typically characterized by either supply rationing or demand rationing. Next prices are assumed to move upwards in case of demand rationing on a market and downwards when supply rationing occurs. Markets are kept in equilibrium by infinitesimal <b>quantity</b> <b>adjustments</b> such that at every moment in time a fixed price equilibrium results. Using only standard assumptions on the primitive concepts of the economy it is shown that the price and <b>quantity</b> <b>adjustment</b> process indeed converges to a fixed price equilibrium for the initially given prices. Moreover, in the long run, when prices are allowed to change, the process is shown to reach a Walrasian equilibrium. A simplicial algorithm is developed to approximate the price and <b>quantity</b> <b>adjustment</b> process arbitrarily close. It is shown that the path of price systems and rationing schemes generated by the algorithm converges to the path of the adjustment process.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a theory of}} rigidity, or more properly inertia, in the responses of economic variables to changing environments. The theory rests on three fundamental assumptions: (1) that firms are risk averse, (2) that firms are uncertain of the impacts of changing decision variables and (3) that this uncertainty increases {{with the size of}} deviations in decision variables from appropriately defined past level. Under these circumstances an optimal portfolio of incremental decision variable adjustments exists which (a) takes variance minimizing adoptions to environmental change as a point of departure and then (b) is weighted in favor of changes in variables whose effects are less uncertain. In considering price and <b>quantity</b> <b>adjustments,</b> this implies that price and wage adjustments should largely incorporate expected inflation and, from that point, should be small relative to <b>quantity</b> <b>adjustments,</b> since in most situations the uncertainties associated with the consequences of <b>quantity</b> <b>adjustment</b> should be smaller than those associated with price adjustments. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{responses to}} an administered questionnaire in which owner-managers of seventy-three small firms {{were asked how}} they would respond to booms and recessions. Responses suggest that <b>quantity</b> <b>adjustments</b> to demand fluctuations {{are more important than}} price adjustments. There is also evidence that downward price adjustments are more likely in recessions than are upward price changes in booms, but this asymmetry is absent in firms with cash flow problems. This tallies with the predictions of a recent customer markets model. However, the asymmetry in <b>quantity</b> <b>adjustments</b> appears to move in the opposite direction, with more adjustments taking place in booms. Copyright 1993 by Royal Economic Society. ...|$|R

50|$|In sum, to Keynes {{there is}} {{interaction}} between excess supplies in different markets, as unemployment in labour markets encourages excessive saving - and vice versa.

40|$|The provincial decree {{applying}} {{to the construction}} industry in Quebec has created a situation of bilateral monopoly in that segment {{of the labor market}} (unions on the supply side and entrepreneurs on the demand side). If negotiations are undertaken at a time where business conditions are booming, then the unions have a very powerful negotiating power. Since contracts are signed for a three year period, wage increases do not afterwards reflect market conditions. Since wages are fixed by the provincial decree, there is then a <b>quantity</b> <b>adjustment</b> in the construction sector. In this paper, we have specified and estimated a model that allows us to measure the bilateral monopoly impact of wage increases and to compute <b>quantity</b> <b>adjustments</b> in the construction market. It is shown then that the provincial decree adversily affects the competition position of the construction industry in Quebec and that restauring this position involves a severe recession in the construction industry. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a price and <b>quantity</b> <b>adjustment</b> process in {{continuous}} time is considered for an economy with production factors and nal goods. We assume that each nal good {{is produced by}} a constant returns to scale production technology with only factor goods as inputs. The price and <b>quantity</b> <b>adjustments</b> {{take place on the}} markets for factor goods only. During the process, the prices in the nal good markets adjust instantaneously by setting the price of a nal good equal to the production costs. Pro-duction adjusts instantaneously to meet the demand and keeping the output markets in equilibrium. The adjustment process consists of three consecutive parts. First, in the short run part of the process the factor prices are assumed to be rigid and only <b>quantity</b> <b>adjustments</b> take place until an out of equilibrium situation is reached in which on each market either equilibrium under supply rationing prevails or excess demand and no supply rationing is observed. Next, in the mid run the factor prices are adjusted upwards in markets with excess demand, while on the other factor markets the supply rationing is adjusted to keep them in equilibrium. This process of adjusting quantity constraints in factor markets with excess supply and prices on factor markets with excess demands is shown to lead to a supply constrained equilibrium. Thirdly, in the long run the factor prices in markets with supply constraints are decreased, whereas supply constraints and prices in all other factor markets adjust to keep those markets in equilibrium. It is shown that eventually a Walrasian price system is reached...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} relation between foot size and contextual syllable-weight. In particular, it focuses on the influence that foot disyllabicity has on triggering <b>quantity</b> <b>adjustments</b> of syllable weight. Within Optimality Theory (Prince and Smolensky 1993; 2004), this dissertation formally addresses {{the relation between}} foot size and syllable weight through the stringency relation between two constraints: *FOOT(σ) and *FOOT(μ). The former penalizes feet smaller than two syllables and the latter, feet smaller than two moras. In isolation, they create a scale in which disyllabic feet are more preferable than ii monosyllabic feet and, in turn, bimoraic monosyllabic feet (symbolized as (H) -feet) are more preferable than monomoraic monosyllabic feet (symbolized as (L) -feet). The existence of other conflicting constraints can, however, prevent the occurrence of disyllabic feet, which in turn causes the emergence of monosyllabic feet. Whether feet are disyllabic or monosyllabic in a given context depends on the conflict between respecting the constraints that inhibit <b>quantity</b> <b>adjustments,</b> complying with those that restrict the distribution of syllable weight and satisfying the constraints *FOOT(σ) and *FOOT(μ) ...|$|R
