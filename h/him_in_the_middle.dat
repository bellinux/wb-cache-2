5|$|Judy Taylor, {{author of}} several books about Potter and her works, observes that Potter had {{difficulty}} drawing the human form, and, {{as a result of her}} limitations, restricted depictions of Mr. McGregor in The Flopsy Bunnies to his hands and feet. Any awkwardness in their depictions was minimized by presenting his hands and feet in isolation and from the bunnies' point of view. In the few full-length illustrations of Mr. McGregor, the need to depict his face was eliminated by presenting <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> or far distance and from the rear.|$|E
5|$|Does it {{surprise}} {{you that a}} busy man found time to finish so many volumes, many of which deal with such minute details?... He used to begin to study at night on the Festival of Vulcan, not for luck but from his love of study, long before dawn; in winter he would commence at the seventh hour... He could sleep at call, and it would come upon him and leave <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of his work. Before daybreak {{he would go to}} Vespasian– for he too was a night-worker– and then set about his official duties. On his return home he would again give to study any time that he had free. Often in summer after taking a meal, which with him, as in the old days, was always a simple and light one, he would lie in the sun if he had any time to spare, and a book would be read aloud, from which he would take notes and extracts.|$|E
5|$|Amid growing French and US {{skepticism}} of {{his ability}} to provide stable rule, Diệm forced the matter to a head in April 1955. He ordered the Bình Xuyên to relinquish control of the National Police and submit to his command by integrating into the VNA or disbanding, threatening to crush them if they refused. He bribed Hòa Hảo and Cao Đài commanders into joining the VNA, gradually resulting in the defection of some commanders and their units, while others continued to lead their forces against Saigon. The Bình Xuyên defied Diệm's ultimatum. On 27 April, the VNA initiated the Battle for Saigon. After a brief but violent battle that left between 500 and 1,000 people dead and about 20,000 homeless, the Bình Xuyên were crushed. Diệm had regained both U.S. confidence and control of the police. Jubilant crowds lauded Diệm and denounced Bảo Đại, who had tried to dismiss <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the battle to prevent him from quelling the Bình Xuyên. In addition, General Paul Ely, the head of the French presence in Vietnam, tried to impede Diệm; his troops put road blocks against the VNA and gave intelligence to the Bình Xuyên.|$|E

25|$|In July 2001, Laursen was loaned out to Serie A rivals A.C. Milan, {{who needed}} depth in their squad. He started out strong {{for his new}} club, scoring two goals {{in the first four}} rounds of the 2001–02 Serie A season, and played 22 league games in his first season with Milan. Milan decided to buy <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the season for a fee of 21.5 billion lire (€11,103,823). In the summer 2002, Milan bought Italian {{international}} defender Alessandro Nesta, and Laursen's playing time diminished to a combined 20 league games in the next two seasons.|$|E
25|$|Earnhardt Jr. {{kicked off}} 2015 with a ninth-place {{finish in the}} Sprint Unlimited. On February 19, he won Budweiser Duel No. 1 in what was his fourth triumph in the Budweiser Duels. In the Daytona 500, he led for over 30 laps but {{on one of the}} last restarts, he made a move that mired <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> without help, and fell back to 16th with 15 laps to go, but managed to make his way back to third place by the last lap. This was his fifth Top 3 finish in the Daytona 500 in six years, after his runner-up {{finishes}} in 2010, 2012 and 2013, and his win in 2014.|$|E
25|$|On 13 August 1997, after 10 years, 407 appearances, 108 {{goals and}} four major trophies, Barnes {{left on a}} free transfer. He had missed just three Premier League games in his final season at Anfield, scoring four goals (including a memorable late winner against Southampton just after Christmas) as they had led the table {{for much of the}} first half of the season before being {{overhauled}} by eventual champions Manchester United at the end of January and having to settle for a fourth-place finish. Paul Ince, a slightly younger central midfielder with a completely contrasting combative style was signed to replace <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the park and Barnes felt signing a player like Ince may not solve all of Liverpool's problems.|$|E

25|$|In Weimar, one of Weißheimer's {{compositions}} {{was first}} performed by an orchestra. Liszt included Weißheimer's symphony on Schiller's Ritter Toggenburg {{on the program}} for the court concerts that he conducted on 13 March 1860. To allow Weißheimer to take part in this concert at the Grand Ducal Palace, which was only accessible to the court and nobility, Liszt had him wear a tail coat and a white tie and placed <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the string orchestra, where he had to pretend to play the violin. At the end of the concert, the Grand Duke and Grand Duchess expressed approval of the composer. The next day on his visit to Liszt, Weißheimer met daughter Cosima, who was married for two years to von Bülow and who would later become Wagner's second wife.|$|E
25|$|Brett Lee had {{dominated}} {{the clash between}} himself and Sehwag for some brief moments when he hit Sehwag on the helmet twice, with just-short of a length deliveries each time. Sehwag also enjoyed a slice of luck, when a comedy of errors by the Australian fielders resulted in a run-out chance being put down. Sehwag had just struck a ball off Lee on the off-side, and had run a single, and had made his mind {{to go for the}} second, but a moment's hesitation, left <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the pitch and when the fielder threw the ball to Lee, the bowler, Sehwag was a few yards away from the crease. Unmindful of this, Lee threw the ball to the batting end, where Chopra was struggling to get to. The wicketkeeper, however, dropped the ball, only for Chopra to make it back to the crease in time.|$|E
25|$|Alison is {{increasingly}} worried about Ben's lack {{of responsibility and}} commitment, and has doubts about the longevity of their relationship. These thoughts are due to her sister's unhappy marriage. Debbie's husband, Pete (Paul Rudd), works as a talent scout for rock bands, but he leaves at odd hours in the night, which makes her suspect he is having an affair. Upon investigating, she learns that he is actually part of a fantasy baseball draft, which he explains he participates in {{to be free from}} Debbie's controlling manner. This results in their separation, and when Ben expresses amusement at Pete's deception, it leads to a heated argument with Alison as they drive to her doctor. Angered, she ejects him from her car and abandons <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of a busy street. He tracks her down to her appointment and they both start another argument, leading to their own breakup. Ben and Pete decide to go on a road trip to Las Vegas.|$|E

25|$|Stan {{returns home}} temporarily, but is sent into a hospice {{against his own}} will as his health {{continues}} to deteriorate. On Good Friday 2015, Dean returns to Albert Square alongside his father Buster Briggs (Karl Howman), insisting on visiting Stan at the hospital before he flees the country. Shirley calls the police to stop Dean leaving, and he is arrested for breaking his bail conditions, which saddens Stan. The following week, Stan attempts to bring his family together by asking Mick to make amends with Shirley, but although he tries, she refuses {{to show up at}} Stan and Cora's wedding ceremony. The ceremony is interrupted when Stan appears to be in pain, and the nurses give him pain relief. He promises Cora that they will marry the next day and she sleeps over in his room. Shirley also shows up there to be with <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the night, having {{had a change of heart}} after hearing of Jim Branning's (John Bardon) death. Stan's health rapidly deteriorates over the night, and the Carters and Cora keep a bedside vigil by his side. When Mick and Shirley argue, Stan advises them to make peace for his sake. Mick leaves while Shirley stays with Stan. Shirley reminisces the times she had with Mick when he was young. Stan hints to Shirley that she should put her family problems to rest, before dying peacefully.|$|E
25|$|In the singles tournament, Federer first played Colombian Alejandro Falla, {{who took}} him to five sets at the 2010 Wimbledon Championships. Federer took the first set with ease, but lost a few match points and his serve late in the second set, {{allowing}} Falla to make a comeback and level the match at one set all. Federer regained control over the match, however, and closed out the third set {{to advance to the}} second round. Federer then played Frenchman Julien Benneteau, who had also taken him to five sets at the 2012 Wimbledon Championships just over a month ago. Contrary to their previous matchup, Federer faced no challenge from Benneteau, and flew past him to a straight-sets win in less than an hour. Federer next played Uzbek Denis Istomin in the third round, and clinched a tight first set after a short rain delay. He then took command in the second set and defeated Istomin. In the quarterfinals, Federer faced American John Isner, and secured the first set after a break of Isner's serve allowed him to serve for the set. Federer then battled with Isner to reach a tiebreak in the second-set, which ended when a return of Isner's serve clipped the top of the net and dribbled over to win the match. In the semifinals, Federer faced Juan Martín del Potro for the sixth time this season. He found himself in a one-set deficit after del Potro broke <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the first set and held to win the set. Federer, however, fought back in the second set, and after losing two opportunities to serve for the set, won the tiebreak with an ace on his second set point. Federer and del Potro then began a third set which saw del Potro creating a one-game lead and Federer matching it in his service games. Federer managed to break del Potro after twenty games, but was unable to convert the break, and del Potro broke back to continue the pattern. Eventually, Federer engineered another break at seventeen games all, and held serve to win the match on his second match point. The match, which stretched over four hours and twenty-six minutes, broke the record for the longest best-of-three-sets system match in the Open Era, surpassing the 4 hours and 3 minutes in Rafael Nadal’s victory over Novak Djokovic in the 2009 Madrid Masters. Federer, who secured his first Olympic medal and Switzerland's first medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics with his semifinal win, played Briton Andy Murray in the final. Federer was unable {{to find a way to}} control the match, and saw his serve broken five times en route to a loss in straight sets, which resulted in earning him a silver medal. Federer’s finals finish, along with World No. 2 Novak Djokovic's semifinals finish, guaranteed that he would retain his World No. 1 ranking.|$|E

500|$|Co-writer Frank Spotnitz {{described}} the episode as a [...] "fortunate accident". Late {{in the fourth}} season of the show Gillian Anderson left the show for a week to film her part in the film The Mighty. The producers, knowing {{that they would have}} to write an episode without Dana Scully, decided it was not fair to have David Duchovny carry the same workload as in a normal episode considering her absence. As such, a story was devised in which his involvement would be light. This resulted in the decision to write, for the second year in a row, an episode focused on Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi). Howard Gordon, having written the previous Skinner-centric episode, [...] "Avatar", joined Spotnitz and the two wrote the episode over a weekend while another Gordon-written episode, [...] "Synchrony", was in production. The writers felt that this was the perfect time to bring in Skinner's deal with The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) to cure Scully's cancer, made in the episode [...] "Memento Mori". Frank Spotnitz said of Skinner's deal, [...] "The hard thing for Skinner was that we had to keep <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle.</b> We had him tell Mulder not to bargain with The Smoking Man in order to save Scully's life. And then he himself struck a Faustian bargain with the Cigarette Smoking Man and was in his debt for some kind." ...|$|E
