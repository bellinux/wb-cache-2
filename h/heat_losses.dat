5|$|Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) {{has been}} a leader in laser-driven {{inertial}} confinement fusion (ICF) since the initial concept was developed by LLNL employee John Nuckols in the late 1950s. The basic idea was to use a driver to compress a small pellet known as the target that contains the fusion fuel, a mix of deuterium (D) and tritium (T). If the compression reaches high enough values, fusion reactions begin to take place, releasing alpha particles and neutrons. The alphas may impact atoms in the surrounding fuel, heating them {{to the point where they}} undergo fusion as well. If the rate of alpha heating is higher than <b>heat</b> <b>losses</b> to the environment, the result is a self-sustaining chain reaction known as ignition.|$|E
25|$|The {{temperature}} of corium {{depends on its}} internal heat generation dynamics: the quantities and types of isotopes producing decay heat, dilution by other molten materials, <b>heat</b> <b>losses</b> modified by the corium physical configuration, and <b>heat</b> <b>losses</b> to the environment. A compact corium mass will lose less heat than a thinly spread layer. Corium of sufficient temperature can melt concrete. A solidified mass of corium can remelt if its <b>heat</b> <b>losses</b> drop, by being covered with heat insulating debris, or if water that is cooling the corium evaporates.|$|E
25|$|The {{role of the}} gas is {{to prevent}} {{evaporation}} of the filament, without introducing significant <b>heat</b> <b>losses.</b> For these properties, chemical inertness and high atomic or molecular weight is desirable. The presence of gas molecules knocks the liberated tungsten atoms back to the filament, reducing its evaporation and allowing it to be operated at higher temperature without reducing its life (or, for operating at the same temperature, prolongs the filament life). It however introduces <b>heat</b> <b>losses</b> (and therefore efficiency loss) from the filament, by heat conduction and heat convection.|$|E

A brief review of the results for a flame without volumetric <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> is presented. The results are compared to those obtained recently for a flame suffering combined upstream/ downstream volumetric <b>heat</b> <b>loss.</b> For the structure, the analysis predicts that the expressions for the burning rate and the specific <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> rate to the burner are not identical, unlike that shown for the freely propagating flame with volumetric <b>heat</b> <b>loss.</b> This is in agreement with earlier investigations of a flame suffering the three separate <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> modes studied using thin-flame theory. Also in agreement with these earlier studies, the analysis predicts that the downstream <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> mode is larger in magnitude than the upstream <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> mode. For the diffusional-thermal instability, the analysis demonstrates that for the linear stability model considered, the effects of upstream and downstream <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> appear in additive form. For fixed mass flux and volumetric <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> intensity, {{it is found that}} the downstream <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> mode is more effective than the upstream <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> mode in promoting flame instability. These results {{are similar to those of}} the freely propagating flame with volumetric <b>heat</b> <b>loss.</b> A flame diagram dependent on the thermochemical data and volumetric <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> mode is produced, which illustrates the stable flame region and the predicted extinction limits for low to medium values of the mass flux. It is found that at high mass flux no extinguishment point may be identified...|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{a multidimensional}} model {{that the authors}} have {{previously}} developed for computing radiant <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> in an internal combustion engine is applied to study radiant <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> characteristics in a Diesel engine.

5000|$|Any hot object {{ultimately}} {{returns to}} thermal equilibrium with its environment, due to <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> from conduction, convection and radiation. Efficiency (the proportion of heat energy retained for a predefined time period) {{is directly related}} to <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> from the collector surface. Convection and radiation are the most important sources of <b>heat</b> <b>loss.</b> Thermal insulation is used to slow <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> from a hot object.

25|$|Where {{temperatures}} below about 95°C are sufficient, as {{for space}} heating, flat-plate collectors of the nonconcentrating type are generally used. Because {{of the relatively}} high <b>heat</b> <b>losses</b> through the glazing, flat plate collectors will not reach temperatures much above 200°C even when the heat transfer fluid is stagnant. Such temperatures are too low for efficient conversion to electricity.|$|E
25|$|Isothermal {{compression}} and expansion approaches attempt to maintain operating temperature by constant heat exchange to the environment. They are only practical for low power levels, without very effective heat exchangers. The theoretical efficiency of isothermal energy storage approaches 100% for perfect heat {{transfer to the}} environment. In practice neither of these perfect thermodynamic cycles is obtainable, as some <b>heat</b> <b>losses</b> are unavoidable.|$|E
25|$|The surface-to-volume-ratio in {{the moving}} {{combustion}} chamber is so complex that a direct comparison cannot {{be made between}} a reciprocating piston engine and a Wankel engine. The flow velocity and the <b>heat</b> <b>losses</b> are quite different. Surface temperature characteristics are completely different; the film {{of oil in the}} Wankel engine acts as insulation. Engines with a higher compression ratio have a worse surface-to-volume ratio. The surface-to-volume ratio of a reciprocating piston diesel engine is much poorer than a reciprocating piston gasoline engine, but diesel engines have a higher efficiency factor. Hence, comparing power outputs is a realistic metric. A reciprocating piston engine with equal power to a Wankel will be approximately twice the displacement. When comparing the power-to-weight ratio, physical size or physical weight to a similar power output piston engine, the Wankel is superior.|$|E
40|$|The {{numerical}} {{study and}} optimization of combined laminar natural convection and surface radiation heat transfer in solar cavity receiver with plate fins {{is presented in}} this paper. Minimizing <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> in cavity receivers {{is seen as an}} effective way to enhance the thermal performance and the use of plate fins has been proposed as a low cost means to minimize <b>heat</b> <b>loss.</b> Firstly, the influence of operating temperature, emissivity of the surface, orientation and the geometric parameters on the total <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> from the receiver was investigated. It was observed that convective <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> is largely affected by the angle of inclination of the receiver, the presence of fins and the number of fins in the receiver. As for the radiation <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> it was observed that it is mainly influenced by the properties of the cavity receiver surface. The radiation <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> was found to be constant at all the angles of the receiver. Significant reduction in natural convection <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> from the cavity receiver was accomplished by using the plate fins whereas radiation <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> was marginally reduced by about 5 %. Secondly, the optimization was conducted to obtain the optimal fin geometry and lastly, the overall thermal efficiency of the receiver was presented at different operating temperatures. The overall cavity efficiency marginally increased by approximately 2 % with the insertion of fin plates although the convective <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> was suppressed by about 20 %. This {{is due to the fact}} that radiation <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> dominates at high operating temperatures compared to convective <b>heat</b> <b>loss.</b> National Research Foundation and University of Pretoria[URL]...|$|R

Journal of {{environmental}} engineeringIn {{order to the}} evaluate <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> from hot water supply lines in a residential building, hot water demand {{in a house in}} Chiba prefecture was measured and analyzed. The following results were obtained. 1. The <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> of the hot water supply line was about 132 kJ for the shower and 110 kJ for the bathtub in winter. Since the temperature difference between the inlet and outlet of the hot water supply line is small, the measured <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> from the hot water supply line sometimes becomes negative. 2.

25|$|Hot {{water from}} the {{treatment}} plant was circulated in small-bore pipes alongside the pipeline to reduce <b>heat</b> <b>losses</b> and potential hydrate formation, an ice-like substance that can cause blockages. At the Pickering treatment plant raw gas was routed through a slug catcher and inlet separator to remove liquid hydrocarbons and water. Gas flowed to two parallel vetrocoke absorbers where it was washed with a counter-current aqueous solution of soda ash and arsenic compounds to convert the hydrogen sulphide to elemental sulphur. Gas then flowed to a hydrocarbon recovery unit where it was chilled to remove further liquid hydrocarbons, the dry sulphur-free gas passed through a British Gas metering station to Feeder No. 6 of the National Transmission System which passes through Pickering. The sulphur-rich solution from the absorbers was routed to oxidiser regenerators where air was bubbled through the solution to remove the sulphur {{in the form of}} a froth. The froth was dried in a rotary vacuum filter and heated in an autoclave to allow removal of impurities prior to being stored in tanks at about 130°C from where it was removed by heated road tanker. The regenerated absorber solution from the oxidisers, together with recovered solution from the vacuum filters, was returned for reuse in the vetrocoke absorbers. Hydrocarbon liquids were routed to condensate stabilizers and then to storage tanks for removal by road tanker.|$|E
500|$|The SST has a diurnal range, {{just like}} the Earth's {{atmosphere}} above, though {{to a lesser degree}} due to its greater specific heat. [...] On calm days, the temperature can vary by [...] [...] The temperature of the ocean at depth lags the Earth's atmosphere temperature by 15 days per , which means for locations like the Aral Sea, temperatures near its bottom reach a maximum in December and a minimum in May and June. [...] Near the coastline, offshore winds move the warm waters near the surface offshore, and replace them with cooler water from below in the process known as Ekman transport. [...] This pattern increases nutrients for marine life in the region. [...] Offshore river deltas, freshwater flows {{over the top of the}} denser seawater, which allows it to heat faster due to limited vertical mixing. [...] Remotely sensed SST can be used to detect the surface temperature signature due to tropical cyclones.

[...] With respect to hotter summer weather, green roofing is able to reduce the solar heating of a building by reflecting 27% of solar radiation, absorbing 60% by the vegetation through photosynthesis and evapotranspiration, and absorbing the remaining 13% into the growing medium. Such mitigation of solar radiation {{has been found to}} reduce building temperatures by up to 20°C and reduce energy needs for air-conditioning by 25% to 80%. [...] This reduction in energy required to cool a building in the summer is accompanied by a reduction in energy required to heat a building in the winter, thus reducing the energy requirements of the building year-round which allows the building temperature to be controlled at a lower cost.|$|E
