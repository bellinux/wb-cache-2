5|$|The ironic thing <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> grew up {{listening}} to primarily American music {{and fell in love with}} American music. I love country music. I grew up with George Jones and Charley Pride and Jim Reeves. All that stuff was playing in the house. That's what I wanted to seek out. That's what I wanted to play. Carol was into Tammy Wynette. Trev Warner is Kym's dad, and he was the first person to bring bluegrass music to Australia.|$|E
5|$|The {{whole point}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are the song. The self {{is coming from}} a state of pure awareness, {{from the state of}} being. All the rest that comes about in the outward manifestation of the {{physical}} world (including all the fluctuations which end up as thoughts and actions) is just clutter. The true nature of each soul is pure consciousness. So the song is really about transcending and {{about the quality of the}} transcendent.|$|E
5|$|In {{discrete}} tomography, {{a simplified}} {{version of the}} problem that has been frequently studied, the shape to be recovered is a polyomino (a subset of the squares in the two-dimensional square lattice), and the cross-sections provide aggregate information about the sets of squares in individual rows and columns of the lattice. For instance, in the popular nonogram puzzles, also known as paint by numbers or griddlers, the set of squares to be determined represents the dark pixels in a binary image, and the input given to the puzzle solver tells him or her how many consecutive blocks of dark pixels to include in each row or column of the image, and how long each of those blocks should be. In other forms of digital tomography, even less information about each row or column is given: only {{the total number of}} squares, rather than the number and length of the blocks of squares. An equivalent version of the problem <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> must recover a given 0-1 matrix given only the sums of the values in each row and in each column of the matrix.|$|E

25|$|Pessimism bias is {{an effect}} {{in which people}} exaggerate the {{likelihood}} that negative things will happen to them. It contrasts with optimism bias. The difference <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are in an improbable way worried about our society's future.|$|E

25|$|Other {{reviews of}} the book and audio-book were mixed.

Greil Marcus said Rakoff's stories are not as funny as those he read on the radio.|$|E
25|$|One concern <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{may end up}} with {{thousands}} of vaccines to prevent every virus that can change our cells.

It is likely that HPV, for instance, has a role in cancers of the mucous membranes of the mouth.|$|E
25|$|Unger's {{critique}} of and alternative to social programs {{goes to the}} heart of civil society. The problem we are faced with now, he claims, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have a bureaucratic system of distribution that provides lower quality service and prohibits the involvement of civil society in the provision of public services. The alternative he lays out is to have the state act to equip civil society to partake in public services and care. This would entail empowering each individual to have two responsibilities, one in the productive economy and one in the caring economy.|$|E

25|$|In verses {{five and}} six, Mazaraki gives his verdict on the property. He notes {{the absence of}} bird song, which he regards as a very bad sign. In verse six the doctor declares: “If no birds are heard/death reigns here./My advice <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> depart this place quickly/so off I go”. The doctor mounts up {{and returns to the}} city in verse seven, {{accompanied}} by Stampfer, Gutmann, and Barnett. Only Salomon “with his prophetic eyes” remains behind to spend the night on that hill, we are told in verse eight.|$|E
25|$|A more {{sophisticated}} method, described by Redelmeier, {{has been used}} by many authors as a way of not only counting polyominoes (without requiring that all polyominoes of order n be stored in order to enumerate those of order n+1), but also proving upper bounds on their number. The basic idea <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> begin with a single square, and from there, recursively add squares. Depending on the details, it may count each n-omino n times, once from starting from each of its n squares, or may be arranged to count each once only.|$|E
25|$|Some {{people have}} {{characterized}} his removal as a rendition. That {{is not what}} happened here. It was a deportation.

And we do that in every case. And if in fact he had been rendered to Syria, we would have sought those same kind of assurances, as we do in every case.|$|E
