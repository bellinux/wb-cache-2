5|$|A serious {{accident}} with radioactivity release {{occurred in the}} 3026-D facility at about 5 pm on 29 April 1954. After {{the dissolution of the}} third batch of uranium slugs, the liquid in the dissolver tank did not completely cover the slugs for about 29 hours, which overheated due to decay heat. When the acid was added for the fourth batch, the violent reaction with the hot metal produced gases and forced the solution up the slug loading chute and the pipes. The building staff donned their gas masks and evacuated the building. Radiation levels {{on the third floor of}} the building reached 100roentgen per hour (R/h), and were reduced to 100mR/h by 7 am the next day.

5|$|Static Shock is an American {{animated}} {{television series}} {{based on the}} Milestone Media/DC Comics superhero Static.

The show revolves around Virgil Hawkins, an American boy of African descent, who uses the secret identity of Static after <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> mutagen gas during a gang fight gave him electromagnetic powers.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effects of a particular psychological stress, <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> open-field, on plasma IL- 6 activity in rats. Plasma IL- 6 activity was 40. 6 +/- 7. 2 units/ml in control rats, 105 +/- 6. 8 units/ml after 30 minutes <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> open-field, and 221 +/- 17 units/ml after 60 minutes of exposure (p= 0. 0003). There was a positive correlation (r=. 71, p= 0. 043) between the change in plasma IL- 6 activity and body temperature. However, we conclude, based on earlier data relating plasma IL- 6 activity to body temperature changes following injection of lipopolysaccharide, that the plasma levels of IL- 6 following <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> open-field are not high enough to account for the rise in body temperature observed in rats during this stress. In conclusion, these experiments indicate that <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> psychological stress can elevate the plasma concentration of IL- 6, a known mediator of the acute phase response...|$|R

Even <b>a</b> brief <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> urban environment caused a shift in processing style: the local bias was reduced in traditional Himba who had visited a local town and even more reduced in urbanised Himba who had moved to that town on a permanent basis.

5|$|A {{growing body}} of {{research}} suggests that self-control is akin to a muscle that can be strengthened through practice. In other words, self-control abilities are malleable, a fact that can be a source of hope for those who struggle with this skill. In psychotherapy, treatment for impulse-control issues often involves teaching individuals to realize the downsides of acting on immediate urges and in turn to practice delaying gratification. In anxiety disorders, this process occurs through <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> feared situation – which is very uncomfortable at first, but eventually becomes tolerable and even trains a person's mind and body that these situations are less threatening than originally feared. Exposure therapy is only effective if an individual can delay gratification and resist the urge to escape the situation early on. To shed insight on the tradeoff between short- and long-term gains, therapists might also help individuals construct a pro-con list of a certain behavior, with sections for short-term and long-term outcomes. For maladaptive coping behaviors such as self-injury, substance use or avoidance, there are generally no long-term pros. Meanwhile, abstinence from acting on a harmful urge (i.e., delayed gratification) generally results in long-term benefits. This realization can be a powerful impetus for change.|$|E
5|$|Divers {{operate in}} an {{environment}} for which {{the human body is}} not well suited. They face special physical and health risks when they go underwater or use high pressure breathing gas. The consequences of diving incidents range from merely annoying to rapidly fatal, and the result often depends on the equipment, skill, response and fitness of the diver and diving team. The hazards include the aquatic environment, the use of breathing equipment in an underwater environment, <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> pressurised environment and pressure changes, particularly pressure changes during descent and ascent, and breathing gases at high ambient pressure. Diving equipment other than breathing apparatus is usually reliable, but has been known to fail, and loss of buoyancy control or thermal protection can be a major burden which may lead to more serious problems. There are also hazards of the specific diving environment, and hazards related to access to and egress from the water, which vary from place to place, and may also vary with time. Hazards inherent in the diver include pre-existing physiological and psychological conditions and the personal behaviour and competence of the individual. For those pursuing other activities while diving, there are additional hazards of task loading, of the dive task and of special equipment associated with the task.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, {{a team of}} {{scientists}} led by Owen Beattie, a professor of anthropology at the University of Alberta, began a series of scientific studies of the graves, bodies, and other physical evidence left by Franklin's men on Beechey Island and King William Island. They concluded that the men buried on Beechey Island most likely died of pneumonia and perhaps tuberculosis, and that lead poisoning may have worsened their health, owing to badly soldered cans held in the ships' food stores. However, it was later suggested that the source of this lead may not have been tinned food, but the distilled water systems fitted to the ships. Cut marks on human bones found on King William Island were seen as signs of cannibalism. The combined evidence of all studies suggested that the crewmen did not all die quickly. Hypothermia, starvation, lead poisoning and diseases including scurvy, along with general <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> hostile environment whilst lacking adequate clothing and nutrition, killed everyone on the expedition in the years following its last sighting by Europeans in 1845.|$|E

40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> extremely low frequency magnetic field (ELFMF) on hormone secretion from an islet derived insulinoma cell line, RIN-m.

Treatment with nifedipine reduced the difference in insulin secretion between cells exposed <b>to</b> <b>an</b> ELFMF and sham exposed cells.
