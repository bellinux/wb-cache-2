25|$|Intertidal organisms, {{especially}} those in the high intertidal, must cope with a large range of temperatures. While they are underwater, temperatures may only vary by a few degrees over the year. However, at low tide, temperatures may dip to below freezing or may become scaldingly <b>hot,</b> <b>leading</b> to a temperature range that may approach 30°C (86°F) during a period of a few hours. Many mobile organisms, such as snails and crabs, avoid temperature fluctuations by crawling around and searching for food at high tide and hiding in cool, moist refuges (crevices or burrows) at low tide. Besides simply living at lower tide heights, non-motile organisms may be more dependent on coping mechanisms. For example, high intertidal organisms have a stronger stress response, a physiological response of making proteins that help recovery from temperature stress just as the immune response aids in the recovery from infection.|$|E

MSU started out <b>hot,</b> <b>leading</b> {{by as many}} as 19 early in the first half. The Spartans kept up the pressure in the second half, but Northwestern twice narrowed the lead to four points. But, led by Ellis' 16 points, the Spartans were able to hold off the Wildcats, to win 61-52. Cassius Winston added 15 points and six assists while Nick Ward added 11 points and nine rebounds. The win moved MSU to 10-5 on the season and 2-0 on the season.|$|E
50|$|Until {{the late}} 19th century, the only {{available}} propellant was black powder. Black powder had many disadvantages as a propellant; it has relatively low power, requiring {{large amounts of}} powder to fire projectiles, and created thick clouds of white smoke that would obscure the targets, betray the positions of guns, and make aiming impossible. In 1846, nitrocellulose (also known as guncotton) was discovered, and the high explosive nitroglycerin was discovered at much the same time. Nitrocellulose was significantly more powerful than black powder, and was smokeless. Early guncotton was unstable, however, and burned very fast and <b>hot,</b> <b>leading</b> to greatly increased barrel wear. Widespread introduction of smokeless powder would wait until {{the advent of the}} double-base powders, which combine nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin to produce powerful, smokeless, stable propellant.|$|E

40|$|Hosting {{rights for}} the 2022 FIFA World Cup soccer tournament have been awarded to Qatar through a process that many alleged was corrupt. The climate in Qatar during the summer, when the tournament is {{traditionally}} held, is extremely <b>hot,</b> <b>leading</b> many in FIFA to consider potentially moving the tournament to the winter months. This move would have a major financial impact on professional soccer leagues in Europe and throughout the world, {{as well as on}} broadcasters and business partners. This Comment explores how a legal case could be brought against FIFA for its decision to award the tournament to Qatar. This Comment discusses the judicial bodies that could hear the case—FIFA’s internal judicial bodies, the Court of Arbitration for Sport, and the Swiss Federal Tribunal—and analyzes how this case regarding the 2022 hosting rights would likely proceed in those judicial bodies. It ultimately concludes that given governing rules and precedent there is little likelihood that a case against FIFA could be successful...|$|E
40|$|The {{summer of}} 2003 was {{exceptionally}} <b>hot,</b> <b>leading</b> to {{an excess of}} mortality in Europe. Here, we assess the short-term effects of extreme hot summer temperatures on total daily mortality in Barcelona (Spain). Daily mortality from burial records, maximum temperature, relative humidity and photochemical pollutants, were collected for the period 1999 - 2003. Data was analysed using Poisson regression with generalised additive models. Mortality shows a considerable increase when maximum temperatures are over a threshold temperature of 30. 5 °C. The risk of death associated with an increase of 1 °C above the threshold was 6 %, 7 % and 5 % after 1, 2 and 3 days, respectively. Exposure to extreme hot temperatures leads to an significant increase in mortality. © 2009 ISB.

40|$|International audienceThe {{interaction}} of micro- and nano-structured target surfaces with high-power laser pulses is being widely investigated for its unprecedented absorption efficiency. We have developed vertically aligned metallic micro-pillar arrays for laser-driven proton acceleration experiments. We demonstrate that such targets help strengthen interaction mechanisms when irradiated with high-energy-class laser pulses of intensities ∼ 10 ^ 17 - 18 W/cm^ 2. In comparison with standard planar targets, we witness strongly enhanced hot-electron production and proton acceleration {{both in terms}} of maximum energies and particle numbers. Supporting our experimental results, two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations show an increase in laser energy conversion into <b>hot</b> electrons, <b>leading</b> to stronger acceleration fields.
