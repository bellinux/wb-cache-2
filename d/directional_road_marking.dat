40|$|Instruments {{aimed for}} mobile {{measurement}} of dry <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> retroreflectivity are commercially available. Is {{it possible to}} predict other performance parameters, such as wet <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> retroreflectivity, daylight luminance coefficient and skid resistance, from mobile measurements? The hypothesis is that such predictions {{should be possible to}} accomplish by simulataneous measurement of dry <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> retroreflectivity and macro-texture. From mobile measurement of dry <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> retroreflectivity and macro-texture, empirical models for other performance parameters have been developed. The results show that {{it should be possible to}} assemble a mobile measurement system which can register all <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> performance parameters in the regulations...|$|R

40|$|Public roads without road markings, {{especially}} roads carrying {{high traffic}} volumes, {{would lead to}} chaos and accidents resulting in injuries and loss of life. The road authorities need {{to ensure that all}} signage is well maintained and conforms to the Southern African Development Community Road Traffic Signs Manuals (SADC RTSM) (1999) and the South African Road Traffic Signs Manuals (SARTSM) (1999). The most important aspect of road markings is that they must be retroreflective. The minimum RL for white and yellow road markings is 100 mcd/m 2 /lx and 70 mcd/m 2 /lx respectively (SADC RTSM, 1999). There are other important parameters to which road markings should conform, such as the Qd, colour and skid resistance. There are various types of <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> paints and <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> materials, namely solvent-borne, water-borne, cold plastic, thermoplastic and preformed tape applied universally. In SA, solvent-borne paints, water-borne paints and thermoplastic materials are widely used, with cold plastic materials being increasingly used of late. There are SABS standards on solvent-borne and water-borne <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> paints covering a wide range of aspects. However, there are insufficient standards on plastic <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> materials and therefore some <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> applicators could be applying inferior quality plastic <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> materials. The only specification related to thermoplastic <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> materials published by the SABS is the SABS EN 1424 : 1997 (1997) (<b>Road</b> <b>marking</b> materials - premix glass beads). This specification was adopted by the SABS exactly as per the European Standard EN 1424 : 1997 (1997) and it specifies the requirements for laboratory tests on aspects of premix glass beads such as the granulometry, refractive index, chemical resistance, quality and surface treatment. Since the European specifications are widely adopted by many countries, the BS EN 1436 : 2007 (2007) specification was used in conjunction with the available SA standards in this study to develop the thermoplastic <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> standard. It is more advantageous for the road authority to stipulate the specifications with which <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> products must comply than to give the detailed specification of each constituent. It would be time consuming and costly to test each constituent, besides which the equipment to test the constituents is not readily available in SA. The onus should be on the manufacturer to ensure that the formulation of the <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> material is such that the product meets the required specifications. The service life of road markings is affected by volume and type of vehicles passing over them, the type of road surface, sand and dirt, climatic conditions and application of the road markings. On clean roads, both asphalt and chip seal surfaces, thermoplastic <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> materials have longer RL and Qd service lives than water-borne <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> paints. The white <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> paints and materials generally complied with the colour specification. However, the yellow road markings complied minimally with the colour specification on both clean and dirty roads. Although thermoplastic <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> materials have a longer RL service life on clean roads, it might not be economical to use them on dirty roads since the RL service life was similar for water-borne <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> paints and cold plastic <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> materials. The initial skid resistance of white and yellow 1. 2 mm thermoplastic complied with the specification. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2017. Civil EngineeringMScUnrestricte...|$|R

40|$|A {{completely}} {{autonomous vehicle}} {{is one in}} which a computer performs all the tasks that the human driver normally would. This would mean, to go to a specific destination, a driver will just has to key in the desired destination and the system will be enabled automatically by the computer. From there, the car would take over and drive to destination with no human input. The car would be able to sense its environment and change maneuver and speed when necessary. A system for <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> detection has been set up {{during the course of this}} master's thesis project. In the development of the software, images acquired from a front looking video camera mounted inside the vehicle were used. The problem of using computer vision to develop lane detection system for autonomous vehicle is <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> characteristic. Since the strongest characteristic of a <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> image are the edges, the <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> detection step is based on edge detection. For the detection of the straight edge lines, a Radon based method was chosen. Due to peak spreading in Radon space, the difficulty of detecting the correct peak in Radon space was encountered. A Radon peak detection algorithm was developed based on two values, Rand O. These values make the system robust to the different types of <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> such as continuous <b>road</b> <b>marking,</b> discontinuous <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> and <b>road</b> with shadow. The performance of the <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> detection algorithm was investigated over several different short image sequences. The different sequences included normal countly road driving, a number of different <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> configurations, such as continuous, intermittent and combinations of and images with shadows. The system performs well during the experiments within the difference road condition state above. The work done in this thesis can be used as a starting point in the development of for example a lane departure warning system. The potential of such a system is further increased by merging information retrieved from images with information from the vehicle such as vehicle speed, steering angle and acceleration...|$|R

Due {{to a lack}} of quantitative operation procedures, acceptance outcome can be biased and results in great quality variation. To improve aesthetic quality acceptance procedure of <b>road</b> <b>marking,</b> we develop an innovative <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> quality assessment mechanism, utilizing machine vision technologies. Using edge smoothness as a quantitative aesthetic indicator, the proposed prototype system first receives digital images of finished <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> surface and has the images processed and analyzed to capture the geometric characteristics of the marking. The geometric characteristics are then evaluated to determine the quality level of the finished work. System is demonstrated through two real cases to show how it works. In the end, a test comparing the assessment results between the proposed system and expert inspection is conducted to enhance the accountability of the proposed mechanism...|$|R

40|$|In 2004 the Swedish Road Administration {{initiated}} {{the development of}} a mobile instrument which measures, not only the retroreflectivity of dry road markings, but also other <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> parameters of interest. This study would end up in 2008, and so it did. However, such a development project should continue, as new components, useful for the measurement system, will show up in the future. As an example, a new generation of reflectometer is on the market and others will probably be on the market soon. This report accounts for the status of <b>Road</b> <b>Marking</b> Tester Version 2 in November 2009. The development of RMT 2004 - 2008 has been described in VTI Report 611. The measurements during this period of time showed that, from mobile measurement of the retroreflectivity of dry <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> and its mean profile depth (MPD), it is possible to predict the retroreflectivity of wet <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> with an accuracy that may be acceptable. Furthermore, the skid resistance, the thickness and the geometry of the <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> could be predicted from mobile measurement, using RMT. However, the prediction model regarding skid resistance of new road markings showed poor accuracy. Finally, some few measurements indicated that {{it should be possible to}} predict the daylight luminance coefficient using a modified optocator. Therefore, the work in 2009 focused on the development of prediction of new <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> skid resistance and daylight luminance coefficient...|$|R
