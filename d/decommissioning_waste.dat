30|$|Bentonite is {{identified}} as potential buffer material in deep geological repositories for disposal of high level radioactive wastes (HLW) owing to its very low hydraulic conductivity, large swelling ability and high adsorptive capacity to retain cations (Pusch 2008). However, owing to negative surface charge, bentonite repels anions (van Olphen 1963). 129 I (Iodide- 129) is a fission product encountered in nuclear power plant wastes and is generated from ion-exchange resins, filter sludge, evaporator bottoms, off-gas cartridge filter, trash, and <b>decommissioning</b> <b>wastes</b> (Zhang et al. 2002).

40|$|Traditionally in {{bioassay}} monitoring, 3 H determinations in urine {{have been}} performed using either direct counting (with or without sample decolourisation) or distillation whilst 14 C has been determined on separate sub-samples following chemical isolation of the carbon from samples.

For 3 H, direct counting can be significantly affected by variations in sample composition/colour resulting in varying degrees of sample quench, does not distinguish between aqueous/organically-bound 3 H and is limited to small sample sizes. This study describes the use of purpose built multi-tube combustion furnace for the simultaneous extraction and determination of 3 H and 14 C.

40|$|Decommissioning and dismantlement {{of nuclear}} power plants (NPP) present a final phase of the nuclear power plant {{lifetime}} and essential part of an effective nuclear safety culture. While some countries are implementing nuclear exit strategies and other building new nuclear power plants or prolonging their lifetimes, decommissioning of facilities is imminent. This paper gives a short overview on decommissioning and dismantling strategies and techniques as {{an introduction to the}} applicability of radioactive metal waste recycling and reuse. General estimations suggest that majority of the waste mass resulting from decommissioning and dismantling is radiologically unrestricted material. Remaining one-third is the radioactive material with different ranges of radioactivity.

This approach comprises spent fuel elements, vitrified fission product solution, nuclear power plant operational and <b>decommissioning</b> <b>waste</b> as well as spent sealed radiation sources and miscellaneous waste originating from small waste generators. The Atomic Energy Act gives the responsibility for the disposal of radioactive waste to the Federal Government with the Bundesamt für Strahlenschutz (BfS- Federal Office for Radiation Protection) as the legally responsible authority.

40|$|The {{increased}} {{amount of}} decontamination and decommissioning (D&D) being performed {{throughout the world}} not only strains nuclear cleanup budgets, but places severe demands on the capacities of nuclear waste disposal sites. Although budgets and waste disposal sites {{have been able to}} accommodate the demand thus far, the increasing number of large facilities being decommissioned will cause major impacts to the waste disposal process. It is thus imperative that new and innovative technologies are applied within the D&D industry to reduce costs and waste disposal requirements for the decommissioning of our inventory of large and aging nuclear facilities. One of the most significant problems reactor owner’s deal with is the accurate determination of the types and volumes of wastes that will be generated during decommissioning of their facilities. Waste disposal costs, restrictions, and transportation issues can account for as much as 30 % of the total costs to decommission a facility and thus {{it is very important to}} have accurate waste volume estimates. The use of simulation technologies to estimate and reduce <b>decommissioning</b> <b>waste</b> volumes provides a new way to manage risks associated with this work. Simulation improves the process by allowing facility owners to obtain accurate estimates of the types and amounts of waste prior to starting the actual D&D work. This reduces risk by permitting earlier and better negotiations with the disposal sites, and more time to resolve transportation issues. While simulation is a tool to be used by the D&D contractors, its real value is in reducing risks and costs to the reactor owners...|$|E
40|$|Rocky Flats Closure Project (Site) {{includes}} several multi-year decontamination and decommissioning (D&D) projects which, {{over the next}} four years, will dismantle and demolish four major plutonium facilities, four major uranium facilities, and over 400 additional facilities of different types. The projects are currently generating large quantities of transuranic, low-level, mixed, hazardous, and sanitary wastes. A previous paper described the initial conceptual estimates and methods, and the evolution of these methods based on the actual results from the decommissioning of a ''pilot'' facility. The waste estimating method that resulted from that work was used for the waste estimates incorporated into the current Site baseline. This paper discusses subsequent developments on the topic of waste estimating that have occurred since the baseline work. After several months of operation under the current Site baseline, an effort was initiated to either validate or identify improvements to the waste basis-of-estimate. Specific estimate and estimating method elements were identified for additional analysis based on the element's potential for error and the impact of that error on Site activities. The analysis took advantage of actual, more detailed data collected both from three years additional experience in decommissioning a second plutonium facility and from experience in deactivating certain non-plutonium facilities. It compared the actual transuranic and low-level waste generation against their respective estimates based on overall distribution and for individual media (i. e. equipment type), and evaluated trends.

40|$|We {{estimated}} {{the generation of}} low- and intermediate-level waste (LILW) and high-level waste (HLW) from open and closed nuclear fuel cycles. The closed fuel cycle reflects the development and deployment of fast reactors and pyroprocessing from 2013 to 2100, while the open fuel cycle only considers pressurized water reactors. The closed fuel cycle hardly affects short-term spent fuel management but can save nearly 60 % space of interim storage compared with the open fuel cycle. Compared with the open fuel cycle, the accumulated volume of HLW can be significantly reduced in the closed fuel cycle up to over 95 % in 2100. For this volume reduction, high heat generating fission products should be separated from transuranic waste in pyroprocessing and stored in decay storages for a few hundred years. Mining and milling waste in the closed fuel cycle decreases by about 31 %. In contrast, the closed fuel cycle generates 3. 0 %- 4. 5 % more LILW than the open fuel cycle because fast reactors and pyroprocessing produce more LILW and conversion, enrichment, and fabrication produce less LILW. In the closed fuel cycle, operation and <b>decommissioning</b> <b>wastes</b> from reactor and pyroprocessing, respectively, contribute to 74 % and 8 % of LILW excluding mining and milling wasteclose 1...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. The ongoing {{program of}} nuclear {{facilities}} decommissioning within the UK has generated {{a requirement for}} the characterization of diverse waste forms. Many of the radionuclides requiring quantification are rarely encountered in routine radioanalytical studies. One such radionuclide is 113 mCd, which is produced via neutron activation of Cd in reactor control rods and shielding. The nuclide decays predominantly via beta emission (Eβmax = 580 keV; 99. 86 %), which is accompanied by gamma emission with very low yields (Eγ = 263. 7 keV; Iγ = 0. 02296 %). Quantification of 113 mCd in <b>decommissioning</b> <b>wastes</b> by gamma spectrometry is therefore mostly limited to high-activity samples. Liquid scintillation counting offers an attractive alternative for sensitive measurement of this nuclide but is restricted {{by the lack of}} any reference standard suitable for instrument calibration. Calibration using the Ciemat-NIST approach has therefore been evaluated. 113 mCd was purified using a validated separation procedure from irradiated Cd obtained from a UK research reactor. The purified fractions were then measured on a Wallac 1220 Quantulus liquid scintillation counter previously calibrated using the Ciemat-NIST (CN) approach and results compared with those obtained by gamma spectrometry. Good agreement was observed, confirming the suitability of liquid scintillation counting for the quantification of 113 mCd and the validity of using the CN calibration method for radionuclides where no reference standards are currently available...|$|R
40|$|The European Project on "Treatment and Disposal of Irradiated Graphite {{and other}} Carbonaceous Waste (CARBOWASTE) " has been {{launched}} in 2008 under the 7 th EURATOM Framework Programme (FP 7 - 211333), with duration of four years. This project addresses the retrieval, treatment {{and disposal of}} irradiated graphite (i-graphite) including other carbonaceous waste like structural material made of graphite or non-graphitized carbon bricks and fuel coatings (pyrocarbon, silicon carbide). It addresses both existing legacy waste as well as waste from graphite-based nuclear fuel resulting from {{a new generation of}} nuclear reactors (e. g. V/HTR, Fusion). The CARBOWASTE project is of major importance for the deployment of HTR as each HTR module generates about 5, 000 to 10, 000 Mg of contaminated i-graphite containing some Peta-Becquerel of radiocarbon, during a 60 years operational lifetime. Most of this i-graphite is associated with the moderator, which {{is an integral part of}} the HTR fuel element. Significant progress has been achieved with regards to the techniques for separating the coated particles from the moderator graphite of High-Temperature Reactor (HTR) fuel. Pulsed power fragmentation facilities for HTR fuel compacts and HTR pebble fuel have been put into operation and tested with unirradiated dummy fuel. Further separation methods like homogeneous oxidation, use of intercalation compounds, laser techniques, electrochemical deconsolidation, molten-salt methods etc. have also been investigated. Although tests with irradiated fuel are still pending, it can already be stated that head-end facilities for the reprocessing of spent HTR fuel appear to be feasible and that the HTR fuel cycle can be closed. It has been discovered that a significant part of the contamination (including 14 C) can be removed from irradiated graphite by thermal, chemical or even microbiological treatment. The feasibility of the associated processes is experimentally investigated to determine and optimize the decontamination factors. Reuse of the purified material will also be addressed to close the ¿Graphite Cycle¿ for future graphite moderated reactors. The disposal behavior of graphite and carbonaceous wastes and the improvement of suitable waste packages are another focus of the programme. It is strongly recommended to take <b>decommissioning,</b> <b>waste</b> minimization and waste management issues of graphite-moderated reactors already into account when designing new V/HTR concepts.

40|$|Executive summary Introduction The Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management {{and on the}} Safety of Radioactive Waste Management {{was adopted}} on 29 September 1997 at the Vienna Diplomatic Conference. Finland signed the Convention on 2 October 1997 and {{deposited}} the tools of acceptance on 10 February 2000. The Convention entered into force on 18 June 2001. This report is the 6 th Finnish National Report under the Joint Convention {{in accordance with the}} provisions of Article 32. It will be subject to review in May 2018 in the sixth Review Meeting of the contracting parties in Vienna. The fulfilment of the obligations of the Convention and the development of waste management after the Fifth Review Meeting, during the reporting period 2014 – 2016, are assessed in this report. There are currently two nuclear power plants operating in Finland: Loviisa and Olkiluoto plants. The Loviisa plant comprises two VVER- 440 units (Russian type pressurised water reactors), operated by Fortum Power and Heat Oy (FPH). The Olkiluoto plant comprises two BWR units (boiling water reactors); operated by Teollisuuden Voima Oyj (TVO) and a third PWR (pressurized water reactor) unit is under construction. In addition, Fennovoima Oy (Fennovoima) has applied for a construction licence for one pressurised water reactor (AES- 2006) at Pyhäjoki. Spent fuel from the nuclear power plant units is stored in interim pool type storages at the power plant sites for tens of years until disposal. The interim spent fuel storages have already been in operation for about 30 years. The safety of the interim storages was enhanced during the reporting period. The spent nuclear fuel disposal project has progressed as planned. The construction licence for the encapsulation and disposal facility was granted by the Government to Posiva in November 2015 and the construction of the geological disposal facility started in Olkiluoto in December 2016. Fennovoima started the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of its own spent nuclear fuel disposal in summer 2016. Geological disposal facilities for low and intermediate level waste have been in operation since the 1990 s in Olkiluoto and Loviisa. In the future, the Olkiluoto facility is planned to be extended for operational waste from the OL 3 unit and <b>decommissioning</b> <b>waste</b> from all reactor units in Olkiluoto. The disposal facility in Loviisa will be extended for <b>decommissioning</b> <b>waste</b> from the Loviisa NPP units. Fennovoima has planned to build a geological disposal facility for its low and intermediate level waste at the Pyhäjoki site. Major developments in Finland since the 5 th Review Meeting are as follows: there has been real progress in spent nuclear fuel disposal, as well as the enhancement of spent fuel interim storage safety, in addition improvements have been made in NPP’s LILW management and non-nuclear radioactive waste disposal, and there has been significant progress in the planning of the research reactor decommissioning. Furthermore, the legislative and regulatory framework has been enhanced, national competences for future needs have been evaluated and developed, and the IRRS follow-up mission (IAEA’s Integrated Regulatory Review Service) was carried out in Finland. Only the main achievements are presented in this summary section. More detailed information on the latest developments in the various topics of the Convention is provided in connection with the relevant articles. Section K summarises the main achievements from the reporting period and also presents Finland’s future challenges in nuclear and radioactive waste management. Since the 5 th Review Meeting The 5 th Review Meeting in 2015 identified challenges, and recorded some planned measures to improve the safety of nuclear waste management in Finland. On request of the Review Meeting these issues and the responsed are included in this 6 th National Report of Finland. The issues are listed here, with the related references provided in brackets. A summary of how Finland has proceeded with the identified challenges during the reporting period is given in Section K. Finland – Challenges • Construction and oversight of the spent fuel (SF) disposal facility (Section H, Annexes L. 2 and L. 3) • Decommissioning and waste management of the FiR 1 research reactor (Article 9, Article 26, Annex L. 5) • Ensuring adequate resources and competence in tough economic situations (utilities, waste management organizations, and Government) (Article 20, Article 22) • Communication with public and stakeholders to maintain confidence in safe waste management and regulatory framework (Article 20) • Disposal of a few High-Activity Sealed Sources (HASS), which are not suitable for disposal in existing LILW repositories (Section J). Finland – Planned Measures to Improve Safety • Licensing of the encapsulation plant and the disposal facility for encapsulated spent fuel (Section H, Annexes L. 2 and L. 3) • Implementation of recommendations from the IRRS review (Article 20) • Licensing of research reactor decommissioning and start of dismantling activities (Article 9, Article 26, Annex L. 5). The legislative and regulatory system has been enhanced The current Finnish nuclear legislation is based on the Nuclear Energy Act from 1987, together with a supporting Nuclear Energy Decree from 1988. The Nuclear Energy Act has been revised several times over the years. The revision of the Nuclear Energy Act in 2015 enabled STUK to issue legally binding regulations. Based on the Nuclear Energy Act, STUK issued four regulations in 2016 to replace the earlier Government Decrees on nuclear safety for nuclear power plants, the security in the use of nuclear energy, the emergency response arrangements at nuclear power plants, and the disposal of nuclear waste. In addition, one new regulation for the safety of uranium and thorium production was issued. Development of national competences for future needs STUK’s role and responsibilities were assessed in a peer review, as part of the IRRS mission (IAEA’s Integrated Regulatory Review Service), in October 2012. In the followup mission in June 2015 the regulatory activities in Finland were reviewed based on the IAEA Safety Standards and international best practices. The main conclusion of the IRRS follow up mission was that STUK had made significant progress in most areas and many improvements had been implemented in accordance with the action plan. The implementation of the recommendations from the “Nuclear Energy Research Strategy”-report from 2013 is on-going by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment (MEAE). The main aim is to ensure the availability of the competent resources for the safe use of nuclear energy. As an example of the on-going implementation of the recommendations, the Nuclear Energy Act was updated in 2015 to ensure the financing of the enhancement of the nuclear safety research infrastructure. In addition to the basic training given for the nuclear sciences in universities in Espoo, Helsinki, and Lappeenranta, the availability of competent human resources has also been improved by the additional training of young experts in the nuclear safety field in different ways, e. g. through a networked doctoral programme (YTERA – Doctoral programme for Nuclear Engineering and Radiochemistry in 2012 – 2015) and through separately arranged national courses focusing on nuclear and waste management safety (YK and YJH Courses). Due to the rearrangement of research funding instruments in Finland and additional budget cuts by the Government, STUK has partly terminated and also significantly reduced its radiation safety research. Instead of its own research programme, STUK has established a national radiation safety research programme in co-operation with all universities in Finland to ensure that radiation safety research will continue in Finland. The spent nuclear fuel disposal project has progressed to the construction phase The Finnish nuclear fuel cycle policy is based on the once-through principle. After removal from the reactor spent fuel is stored in interim pool type storages at the power plant sites. After a storage period lasting tens of years, the spent fuel will be disposed of deep in the Finnish bedrock. Posiva submitted construction licence application and supporting safety documentation to the authorities at the end of 2012. STUK’s safety review and assessment was submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment (MEAE) in February 2015. The construction licence was granted by the Government to Posiva in November 2015. The construction of the disposal facility started in December 2016. Posiva is responsible for the preparations for and later on for the implementation of the disposal of spent fuel of its owners TVO and FPH. The disposal project and the granted licence cover spent fuel from five reactors: Loviisa 1 and 2, in addition to Olkiluoto 1, 2 and 3. In the Decision-in-Principle for Fennovoima’s new reactor unit, Fennovoima was required to define its plans for future spent nuclear fuel management and disposal by the end of June 2016. As required, in June 2016 Fennovoima submitted an Environmental Impact Assessment programme for its planned spent fuel disposal activities to the MEAE. Fennovoima and Posiva Solutions Oy (Posiva’s subsidiary that focuses on supplying services) have signed a co-operation agreement to ensure that the expertise of Posiva is available for Fennovoima’s spent nuclear fuel management activities. The co-operation started in 2016. Spent fuel interim storage safety has been enhanced The safety of the spent fuel storages was analysed {{as a part of the}} EU stress tests in relation to the Fukushima Dai-ichi accident. Hazards or deficiencies that would have required immediate action were not found, but areas where safety could be further enhanced were identified (e. g. reducing the dependency on nuclear power plant’s normal electricity supply and distribution systems as well as on the sea water cooled systems for residual heat removal of the reactor, containment and spent fuel storage pools, protection against external flooding, seismic resistance of spent fuel pools, and firefighting systems). The spent fuel interim storage facility in Olkiluoto undergone numerous improvements during its capacity extension, which became operational in summer 2015. These included, e. g. protection against large airplane crashes and enabling a cooling water feed from outside the storage area. Based on the evaluation in relation to the Fukushima Daiichi accident, water level and temperature monitoring functions have been improved for earthquake resistance and for the potential loss of the facility power supply. Additionally, the Loviisa spent fuel storage has been improved after the Fukushima Daiichi accident. The main changes are aimed at reducing the dependency on the plant’s normal electricity supply and distribution system, as well as on seawater cooled systems for residual heat removal from the reactor, containment and spent fuel pools. Furthermore, the flood protection of the NPP has been improved. Operation in low and intermediate level waste management proceeded The predisposal management of LILW was developed in Loviisa NPP during the reporting period as the solidification plant was authorized for full operation in 2016. Loviisa NPP has now been able to start the solidification of historical liquid wastes, which had been stored in tanks from the start of NPP’s operation in the late 1970 s. The aim is to solidify and dispose of all existing liquid waste in the forthcoming years. The disposal of non-nuclear radioactive waste has commenced Non-nuclear radioactive wastes originating, e. g. from research, industry and hospitals has been stored in a cavern in the LILW disposal facility at Olkiluoto. The licence conditions of the Olkiluoto LILW disposal facility were revised in 2012. The revised license enabled the disposal of non-nuclear radioactive waste in the Olkiluoto LILW disposal facility. The disposal of non-nuclear radioactive waste started in 2016 and currently most waste accumulated over the years have been disposed of. Planning for decommissioning Finland’s first nuclear reactor has started The research reactor FiR 1 (TRIGA Mark II, 250 kW) has been in operation since 1962. The operation of FiR 1 has been carried out by VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd. in Espoo since 1971. In 2012, VTT decided to shut down the research reactor due to insufficient funding for its continued operation. The Environmental Impact Assessment procedure for the decommissioning was conducted in 2013 - 2015. FiR 1 will be the first nuclear reactor to be decommissioned in Finland. VTT submitted an application to the Government for a decommissioning licence on June 20, 2017 (formally this is a new operating licence as the present Finnish legislation does not define a decommissioning licence). The dismantling is scheduled to start in early 2019 and to last about two years. The dismantling will be regulated by STUK concerning the radiation and nuclear safety aspects. Challenges for future work in spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste management Finland has identified for itself challenges for the future work in spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste management and these are summarized below. Progress in spent nuclear fuel disposal programme has been identified as a continuous challenge because the proceeding project requires the development of regulatory requirements. Moreover, regulatory oversight needs to be developed and adjusted for the different project phases. STUK has procedures in place to review and update plans and regulations as the disposal project proceeds to each new phase and the needs for development are identified. Furthermore, Posiva is well prepared for the construction phase of the disposal project and preparations are ongoing for the forthcoming operation phase. In addition, the development of national competences and a regulatory framework are identified as a continuous challenge because the nuclear field in Finland is very active at the moment and compentent resources are required both for regulatory oversight as well as for licensees and license applicants. Finland has identified following three main challenges for the future work: • Improvement of the national plan for radioactive waste management Finland has a well-functioning system and technical solutions for the management of nuclear waste arising from NPPs and also for major part of non-nuclear radioactive wastes. However, as a consequence of 1) an incident at a sealed radioactive source in the storage facilities in Suomen Nukliditekniikka and its related clean-up work (for more detail information see Section J, article 28), 2) planning of the research reactor <b>decommissioning</b> <b>waste</b> storage and disposal and 3) unresolved challenges of disposal for a few HASS sources, it has been identified that the national radioactive waste management plan and licensing system needs to be evaluated and improved to ensure a national system with capabilities for all possible waste streams. MEAE has invited an ad-hoc expert group to address these issues. The group will also address recommendations made by the Finnish Safety Investigation Authority about the sealed source incident. This group will start its work in autumn 2017. • Developing competences and a regulatory framework for decommissioning The research reactor, FiR 1, will be the first nuclear reactor to be decommissioned in Finland. As this is the first decommissioning project, Finland has limited experience in this area. VTT and STUK are both co-operating internationally gathering knowledge and experience about the implementation and regulation of decommissioning. The decommissioning project of the research reactor is also a very important learning process for STUK as the experiences gained will be used in updating regulations and YVL guides and also later on in planning the regulatory oversight for the decommissioning of NPPs. • Communication to improve general public’s understanding of disposal safety The Finnish public has a high degree of trust in the radiation and nuclear safety regulator, STUK, and there is a good degree of trust towards the safety of nuclear waste management and disposal. However, the interest of the general public towards disposal seems to be declining. Additionally, the latest poll results (conducted by e. g. Finnish Energy in 2016) show indications of a slight decrease in trust towards thesafety of nuclear waste disposal. Developments of these trends need to be followed in forthcoming polls. The regulatory work and decisions made by the regulator have to be clear and understandable to the general public. The general public should also have the correct understanding of disposal safety and related risks. Due to these challenges, STUK, for its part, initiated a strategic communication development project in spring 2016 to address both the changing communication environment and the use of modern communication tools. Candidate for good practice Finland has identified that the granting of the construction licence for a spent fuel disposal facility is a candidate for good practice. Finland is the first country that has granted a construction licence for a final repository for spent fuel. Construction of the facility is ongoing. The development and evaluation of safe disposal has been a long-lasting systematic process involving conducted in good co-operation with the Government, ministries, regulators, Posiva, nuclear power companies as well as research organisations while acknowledging the roles and responsibilities of the different parties. The approach taken in Finland has enabled timely progress of the disposal project with political and public support and resulted in approval of the construction licencelicence application in 2015. This is a concrete step towards improving safety in a unique and proven manner. Conclusion In conclusion, based on the information presented in the report, Finland complies with the obligations and objectives of the Joint Convention. Challenges for the future have been recognized, regularly reviewed and addressed. The required efforts for continuous improvement have been made...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} few years the nuclear {{industry}} has used concerns about climate change to argue for a nuclear revival. Although industry representatives may have convinced some political leaders that this is a good idea, there is little evidence of private capital investing in nuclear plants in competitive electricity markets. The reason is simple: nuclear power is uneconomical. In an excellent recent analysis, "The Nuclear Illusion," Amory B. Lovins and Imran Sheikh put the cost of electricity from a new nuclear power plant at 14 -cents per kilowatt hour and that from a wind farm at 7 -cents per kilowatt hour. This comparison includes the costs of fuel, capital, operations and maintenance, and transmission and distribution. It does not include the additional costs for nuclear of disposing of waste, insuring plants against an accident, and decommissioning the plants when they wear out. Given this huge gap, the so-called nuclear revival can succeed only by unloading these costs onto taxpayers. If all the costs of generating nuclear electricity are included in the price to consumers, nuclear power is dead in the water. To {{get a sense of the}} costs of nuclear waste disposal, we need not look beyond the United States, which leads the world with 101, 000 megawatts of nuclear-generating capacity (compared with 63, 000 megawatts in second-ranked France). The United States proposes to store the radioactive waste from its 104 nuclear power reactors in the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, roughly 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada. The cost of this repository, originally estimated at $ 58 billion in 2001, climbed to $ 96 billion by 2008. This comes to a staggering $ 923 million per reactor [...] almost $ 1 billion each [...] assuming no further repository cost increases. In addition to being over budget, the repository is 19 years behind schedule. Originally slated to start accepting waste in 1998, it is now set to do so in 2017, assuming it clears all remaining hurdles. This leaves nuclear waste in storage in 121 temporary facilities in 39 states [...] sites that are vulnerable both to leakage and to terrorist attacks. One of the risks of nuclear power is a catastrophic accident like the one at Chernobyl in Russia. The Price-Anderson Act, first enacted by Congress in 1957, shelters U. S. utilities with nuclear power plants from the cost of such an accident. Under the act, utilities are required to maintain private accident insurance of $ 300 million per reactor [...] the maximum the insurance industry will provide. In the event of a catastrophic accident, every nuclear utility would be required to contribute up to $ 95. 8 million for each licensed reactor to a pool to help cover the accident's cost. The collective cap on nuclear operator liability is $ 10. 2 billion. This compares with an estimate by Sandia National Laboratory that a worst-case accident could cost $ 700 billion, a sum equal to the recent U. S. financial bailout. So anything above $ 10. 2 billion would be covered by taxpayers. Another huge cost of nuclear power involves decommissioning the plants when they wear out. A 2004 International Atomic Energy Agency report estimates the decommissioning cost per reactor at $ 250 [...] 500 million, excluding the cost of removing and disposing of the spent nuclear fuel. But recent estimates for some reactors, such as the U. K. Magnox reactors that have high <b>decommissioning</b> <b>waste</b> volumes, decommissioning costs can reach $ 1. 8 billion per reactor. In addition to the costs just cited, the industry must cope with rising construction and fuel expenses. Two years ago, building a 1, 500 -megawatt nuclear plant was estimated to cost $ 2 - 4 billion. As of late 2008, that figure had climbed past $ 7 billion, reflecting primarily the scarcity of essential engineering and construction skills in a fading industry. Nuclear fuel costs have risen even more rapidly. At the beginning of this decade uranium cost roughly $ 10 per pound. Today it costs more than $ 60 per pound. The higher uranium price reflects the need to move to ever deeper mines, which increases the energy needed to extract the ore, and the shift to lower-grade ore. In the United States in the late 1950 s, for example, uranium ore contained roughly 0. 28 percent uranium oxide. By the 1990 s, it had dropped to 0. 09 percent. This means, of course, that the cost of mining larger quantities of ore, and that of getting it from deeper mines, ensures even higher future costs of nuclear fuel. Few nuclear power plants are being built in countries with competitive electricity markets. The reason is simple. Nuclear cannot compete with other electricity sources. This explains why nuclear plant construction is now concentrated in countries like Russia and China where nuclear development is state-controlled. The high cost of nuclear power also explains why so few plants are being built compared with a generation ago. In an illuminating article in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, nuclear consultant Mycle Schneider projects an imminent decline in world nuclear generating capacity. He notes there are currently 439 operating reactors worldwide. To date, 119 reactors have been closed, at an average age of 22 years. If we generously assume a much longer average lifespan of 40 years, then 93 reactors will close between 2008 and 2015. Another 192 will close between 2016 and 2025. And the remaining 154 will close after 2025. But only 36 nuclear reactors are currently under construction worldwide [...] 31 of them in Eastern Europe and Asia. Although there is much talk of building new nuclear plants in the United States, there are none under construction. What these numbers indicate, Schneider points out, is that plant closings will soon exceed plant openings [...] and by a widening margin in the years ahead. The trend is clear. From 2000 to 2005, an average of 4, 000 megawatts of nuclear generating capacity was added each year. Since 2005, this has dropped to only 1, 000 megawatts of additional capacity per year. Even if all reactors scheduled to come online by 2015 make it, the projected closing of 93 nuclear reactors by then will drop nuclear power generation roughly 10 percent below the current level. Unless governments start routinely granting operating permits for reactors more than 40 years old, a half-century of growth in world nuclear generating capacity is about to be replaced by a long-term decline. Despite all the industry hype about a nuclear future, private investors are openly skeptical. In fact, while little private capital is going into nuclear power, investors are pouring tens of billions of dollars into wind farms each year. And while the world's nuclear generating capacity is estimated to expand by only 1, 000 megawatts this year, wind generating capacity will likely grow by 30, 000 megawatts. In addition, solar cell installations and the construction of solar thermal and geothermal power plants are all growing by leaps and bounds. The reason for this extraordinary gap between the construction of nuclear power plants and wind farms is simple: wind is much more attractive economically. Wind yields more energy, more jobs, and more carbon reduction per dollar invested than nuclear. Though nuclear power plants are still being built in some countries and governments are talking them up in others, the reality is that we are entering the age of wind, solar, and geothermal energy...|$|E
