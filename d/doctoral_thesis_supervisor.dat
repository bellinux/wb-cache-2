They {{had known each other}} from the time Bishop Kloppenburg was the <b>doctoral</b> <b>thesis</b> <b>supervisor</b> of Dom Leonardo Boff, a Brazilian Liberation Theologian, also of the Franciscan order (Leonardo Boff left the Catholic priesthood after criticism from then Father Kloppenburg directed at Boff's liberation theology). The relationship of Bishop Kloppenburg to Bishop, and then Cardinal Ratzinger is described in Pope Benedict XVI, a biography of Pope Benedict XVI by John L. Allen (Continuum, 2000).|$|E
50|$|Siegel was an antimilitarist, and in 1917, during World War I he was {{committed}} to a psychiatric institute as a conscientious objector. According to his own words, he withstood the experience only because of his support from Edmund Landau, whose father had a clinic in the neighborhood. After the end of World War I, he enrolled at the Georg-August University of Göttingen, studying under Landau, who was his <b>doctoral</b> <b>thesis</b> <b>supervisor</b> (Ph.D. in 1920). He stayed in Göttingen as a teaching and research assistant; many of his groundbreaking results were published during this period. In 1922, he was appointed professor at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität of Frankfurt am Main as the successor of Arthur Moritz Schönflies. Siegel, who was deeply opposed to Nazism, {{was a close friend}} of the docents Ernst Hellinger and Max Dehn and used his influence to help them. This attitude prevented Siegel's appointment as a successor to the chair of Constantin Carathéodory in Munich. In Frankfurt he took part with Dehn, Hellinger, Paul Epstein, and others in a seminar on the history of mathematics, which was conducted at the highest level. In the seminar they read only original sources. Siegel's reminiscences about the time before World War II are in an essay in his collected works.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. This paper {{studies the}} {{situation}} of research on Catalan literature between 1976 and 2003 by carrying out a bibliometric and social network analysis of PhD theses defended in Spain. It has a dual aim: to present interesting results for the discipline and to demonstrate the methodological efficacy of scientometric tools in the humanities, a field {{in which they are}} often neglected due to the difficulty of gathering data. Method. The analysis was performed on 151 records obtained from the TESEO database of PhD theses. The quantitative estimates include the use of the UCINET and Pajek software packages. Authority control was performed on the records. Analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the sample and the distribution of responses to each question. Sex differences on key questions were analysed using the Chi-squared test. Results. The value of the figures obtained is demonstrated. The information obtained on the topic and the periods studied in the theses, and on the actors involved (<b>doctoral</b> students, <b>thesis</b> <b>supervisors</b> and members of defence committees), provide important insights into the mechanisms of humanities disciplines. The main research tendencies of Catalan literature are identified. It is observed that the composition of members of the thesis defence committees follows Lotka's Law. Conclusions. Bibliometric analysis and social network analysis may be especially useful in the humanities and in other fields which are lacking in scientometric data in comparison with the experimental sciences...|$|R

40|$|Madras triple helix’ was {{the name}} {{assigned}} by the scientific community in the West, to the molecular model proposed for the fibrous protein collagen, by G N Ramachandran’s group at the University of Madras. As mentioned jocularly in a recent retrospective of this work by Sasisekharan and Yathindra [1], the term was possibly coined due {{to the difficulty of}} Western scientists in pronouncing the Indian names of Ramachandran and his associates. The unravelling of the precise nature of collagen structure indeed makes for a fascinating story and as succinctly put by Dickerson [2]: “ [...] . to trace the evolution of the structure of collagen is to trace the evolution of fibrous protein crystallography in miniature”. This article is a brief review highlighting the pioneering contributions made by G N Ramachandran in elucidating the correct structure of this important molecule and is a sincere tribute by the author to her mentor, <b>doctoral</b> <b>thesis</b> <b>supervisor</b> and major source of inspiration for embarking on a career in biophysic...|$|E
50|$|On 24 February 2011, Bundestagspräsident Norbert Lammert {{declared}} that Guttenberg had used six reports by the parliament’s research service for his <b>doctoral</b> <b>thesis</b> without prior approval. However, Lammert acknowledged {{the fact that}} it was widespread practice among Bundestag Members to use documents prepared by the parliamentary research service without first obtaining the necessary approval. The same day, an open letter to chancellor Merkel was published to be signed by doctoral students and researchers.The successor of Guttenberg’s <b>thesis</b> <b>supervisor</b> Häberle at the University of Bayreuth, Oliver Lepsius, alleged that the minister made the mistakes deliberately and accused him of fraud.|$|R
