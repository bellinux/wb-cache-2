5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1973, Atari began work on a driving game, an idea founder Nolan Bushnell had wanted to do since the company was {{initially}} founded in June 1972 before it was shelved in favor of Pong. The design work itself was handled by Cyan Engineering, which had recently become a semi-independent research and development subsidiary of Atari and had previously handled the prototype design of Gotcha. Larry Emmons developed the circuits to control the car itself in the game, creating the feel of braking, acceleration, and movement. Emmons also used integrated circuit-based memory—specifically, mask ROM (read-only memory)— in his circuit design to store graphical data such as the tracks, rather than the diode arrays that previous arcade games used. This {{is believed to be}} the first use of integrated circuit-based memory in an arcade game, and ROMs thereafter became the standard for arcade and console video games. The mechanical designs for the game, including the steering wheel, pedal, and <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> controllers, were developed by Eigen Systems, located in the same building as Cyan and founded by ex-coworkers of the Cyan founders Emmons and Steven Mayer. At one point, the game's design included a small printer that would print high scores when achieved, but this was removed prior to the final design.|$|E
25|$|This Falcon's Australian-production firsts {{included}} the 6-cylinder's Variable Cam Timing (VCT) and automatic transmissions on the high-performance T-series with an adaptive mode that included steering wheel <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> buttons.|$|E
25|$|The {{top of the}} line, for now, {{is limited}} to the Highline version, with respect to Active, added {{automatic}} climate (climatronic), electric mirrors, electric windows with automatic up/down and full driver side control, chrome inserts on the dashboard, <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> lever, steering wheel and speed brake handles and lined in leather, finally with fog lights.|$|E
40|$|Dynamic {{models of}} a {{single-shaft}} parallel {{hybrid electric vehicle}} (HEV) equipped with automated mechanical transmission (AMT) were described in different working stages during a <b>gear</b> <b>shifting</b> process without disengaging clutch. Parameters affecting the <b>gear</b> <b>shifting</b> time, components life, and <b>gear</b> <b>shifting</b> jerk in different transient states during a <b>gear</b> <b>shifting</b> process were deeply analyzed. The mathematical models considering the detailed synchronizer working process which can explain the <b>gear</b> <b>shifting</b> failure, long time <b>gear</b> <b>shifting,</b> and frequent synchronizer failure phenomenon in HEV were derived. Dynamic coordinated control strategy of the engine, motor, and actuators in different transient states considering the detailed working stages of synchronizer in a <b>gear</b> <b>shifting</b> process of a HEV is {{for the first time}} innovatively proposed according to the state of art references. Bench test and real road test results show that the proposed control strategy can improve the <b>gear</b> <b>shifting</b> quality in all its evaluation indexes significantly...|$|R
40|$|<b>Gear</b> <b>shifting</b> {{strategy}} of vehicle is important {{aid for the}} acquisition of dynamic performance and high economy. A dynamic programming (DP) algorithm is used to optimize the <b>gear</b> <b>shifting</b> schedule for off-road vehicle by using an objective function that weighs fuel use and trip time. The optimization is accomplished through discrete dynamic programming and a trade-off between trip time and fuel consumption is analyzed. By using concave and convex surface road as road profile, an optimal <b>gear</b> <b>shifting</b> strategy is used to control the longitudinal behavior of the vehicle. Simulation {{results show that the}} trip time can be reduced by powerful <b>gear</b> <b>shifting</b> strategy and fuel consumption can achieve high economy with economical <b>gear</b> <b>shifting</b> strategy in different initial conditions and route cases...|$|R
40|$|Older {{people may}} be advised to switch from manual to {{automatic}} <b>gear</b> <b>shifting,</b> because they may have difficulties with dividing their attention between <b>gear</b> <b>shifting</b> and other driving tasks such as perceiving other traffic participants. The question is whether older drivers show a better driving performance when using automatic <b>gear</b> <b>shifting</b> instead of manual <b>gear</b> <b>shifting.</b> Twenty young and twenty older drivers participated in a driving simulator study. Each participant drove both in the manual and the automatic gear conditions. Young drivers reported significantly higher risk taking behaviour in traffic than the older drivers. The older drivers experienced more collisions in the driving simulator than the young participants, but this was only true in the manual gear condition. Older participants swerved more than young participants in both gear conditions. Altogether, the driving performance of the older drivers was better in the automatic gear condition compared with the manual gear condition. This research supports the advice for older drivers to use automatic <b>gear</b> <b>shifting...</b>|$|R
25|$|In August of 2000, the R34 {{received}} a facelift which changed the front bumper to a new, sleek design and Xenon headlights were optional {{across the entire}} range. For the interior, pedals were changed from rubber to aluminium and {{the steering wheel and}} <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> knob were now made of genuine leather. The center console and dials now had an iridium-silver appearance.|$|E
25|$|All laps are timed {{with the}} car's manufacturer-provided {{adjustable}} settings configured for maximum performance — all adjustable suspensions are set {{at their most}} efficient, all <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> maps are at their most aggressive, and driving aids such as traction control are deactivated. Lap times do not offer complete comparisons between the cars, mainly because wet or otherwise poor weather conditions (see time deductions below) can negatively affect lap times.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, the DeLorean came {{stocked with}} a Craig radio; {{this was a}} {{standard}} 1980s tape radio with dual knob controls. Since the Craig {{did not have a}} built-in clock, one was installed in front of the <b>gear</b> <b>shift.</b> DeLorean switched to an ASI stereo {{in the middle of the}} 1982 production run. Since the ASI radio featured an on-board clock, the standard DeLorean clock was removed at the same time.|$|E

25|$|The dirty Hungaroring near Budapest {{provided}} an almost gripless practice and qualifying, that {{eventually led to}} the first non-McLaren pole position of the year – Riccardo Patrese made a Senna-like performance with a 0.31 gap between him and Senna. Another surprise was the equally impressive Alex Caffi, who scored third with a time less than a second slower than that of Patrese – in a car that had been notoriously midfield. The Ferraris, however, suffered badly. Mansell was over two seconds off Patrese's time of an impressive 1:19.7, whilst Berger constantly complained of <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> troubles – even asking the team to change the gearbox pre-race, which they didn't.|$|E
25|$|Styling for 1939 {{featured}} a new two-piece “waterfall” grille with thin vertical bars. The hood was narrower, front door pillars were narrower and hubcaps were larger. Window area increased substantially with {{the rear window}} changing to a one-piece design. On the interior all major gauges were moved to {{in front of the}} driver and the <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> was moved to a column mount. The 4-door phaeton could now be ordered with the built-in trunk appearance or as a fastback, but only three of the later were actually sold. Although prices were reduced (the price of the sedan fell to $1545) sales only rose to 6097, with Roadmaster’s share of Buick’s total sales falling to 2.9 percent.|$|E
25|$|At the 1998 Paris Motor Show, the two-seat, 2.5 m (98in)-long Smart City Coupe (later named Smart Fortwo) was launched. This was the {{beginning}} of a new car brand and one of the more radical vehicle concepts to hit the European market since the bubble cars of the 1950s. It was also {{the beginning}} of a difficult period for Smart. The City Coupe had stability problems that were discovered only immediately prior to launch. These forced a package of alterations to be made that were both expensive and compromised the car’s handling, ride and <b>gear</b> <b>shift.</b> Public concerns over the car's stability, combined with Smart’s elitist marketing and the sheer radicality of the car’s design, proved damaging to initial sales. Production projections were slashed from 200,000 per year to 80,000, close to disastrous for a new brand with just one product.|$|E
5000|$|In some {{machines}} (e.g., automobiles) it {{is necessary}} to alter the gear ratio to suit the task, a process known as <b>gear</b> <b>shifting</b> or changing <b>gear.</b> There are several ways of <b>shifting</b> <b>gears,</b> for example: ...|$|R

40|$|In this study, a <b>gear</b> <b>shifting</b> {{mechanism}} {{was designed}} and applied to make the shifting process faster and less destructible for the driver.

25|$|The race's decisive moment also {{occurred}} on lap eleven. Coming {{out of the}} Melco Hairpin, Vernay fluffed a <b>gear</b> <b>shift,</b> and Mortara moved within half a second of him. At the line, Vernay's lead was 0.4 seconds, Mortara was in his slipstream, and the pass seemed inevitable. Sure enough, Mortara lined him up, and overtook him into Lisboa. Bird took fourth from Ericsson on the same lap, and looked set to finish behind team-mate Bottas; {{a far cry from}} his first-lap exit in 2008 after being taken out by Räikkönen Robertson Racing's Roberto Streit on the run to Mandarin. Mortara cruised to victory, winning by 1.1 seconds ahead of Vernay. Drama struck Bottas on the final lap, when he encountered a problem with one of his wheels. This cost him a podium, as both Bird and Ericsson managed to pass him. Merhi had been set for sixth, but hit the barriers at Lisboa on the final lap, and ended up being classified seventeenth. This promoted the second TOM'S car of Iguchi into sixth, ahead of van der Zande, Mäki, Kunimoto and Bianchi, who made the top ten at Merhi's expense, making up eleven positions in fifteen laps. Outside the top ten were García, Huertas, Vanthoor, Saga, Dusseldorp and Arundel. Missing from the list was Sims, who retired on the final lap with a misfire. He was classified behind Merhi in eighteenth and last.|$|E

40|$|Many {{studies have}} proved that {{elements}} of driver’s behavior related to gear selec-tion have considerable {{influence on the}} fuel consumption. Optimal <b>gear</b> <b>shifting</b> is a complex task, especially for inexperienced drivers. This paper presents an imple-mented idea for <b>gear</b> <b>shifting</b> optimization {{with the aim of}} fuel consumption minimization with more efficient engine working regimes. Optimized <b>gear</b> <b>shifting</b> enables the best possible relation between vehicle motion regimes and engine work-ing regimes. New theoretical-experimental approach has been developed using on-board diagnostic technology which so far has not been used for this purpose. The matrix of driving modes according to which tests were performed is obtained and special data acquisition system and analysis process have been developed. Functional relations between experimental test modes and adequate engine work-ing parameters have been obtained and all necessary operations have been con-ducted to enable their use as inputs for the designed algorithm. The created model has been tested in real exploitation conditions on passenger car with Otto fuel in-jection engine and on-board diagnostic connection without any changes on it. The conducted tests have shown that the presented model has significantly positive ef-fects on fuel consumption which is an important ecological aspect. Further devel-opment and testing of the model allows implementation in wide range of motor ve-hicles with various types of internal combustion engines.

500|$|Brian {{picks up}} Stewie from a play date. On the drive home, Stewie listens to [...] "Before He Cheats" [...] by Carrie Underwood on the radio. He decides {{to stay in}} the car by himself to {{continue}} listening after they reach home and accidentally hits the <b>gear</b> <b>shift,</b> causing the car to move forward. Thinking he can drive, Stewie takes the car for a ride and is thrilled by the experience. He hears on the car radio a contest to win Justin Bieber concert tickets. Stewie calls the radio station on his cell phone but loses control of the car and crashes into a lamppost. (Herbert is heard on the radio winning the tickets.) Stewie takes the car home with the front of the vehicle completely destroyed. Brian discovers the damage and immediately blames Stewie, who tries to deny his involvement, but Brian points out that Stewie left Rupert in the car. Brian says he'll tell Peter and Lois, and Stewie cries. Afraid of being punished, Stewie runs away. He leaves a CD-ROM for Brian that details his plans. Stewie takes the bus to the airport, but disembarks in the wrong neighborhood. Consuela, the Griffin family's former maid, finds him and takes him home. Brian finds Stewie, and tells him that he did not tell anyone about the accident. They attempt to leave Consuela's home, but she insists on keeping Stewie as her own baby. Stewie steals a gun and shoots her in the foot, but says that he didn't want to hurt her because she had shown kindness to him in the past. Brian and Stewie return home.|$|E
