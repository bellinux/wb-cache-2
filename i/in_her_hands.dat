5|$|The green {{complexion}} {{is associated}} with deep knowledge and is also the colour of Budha, the presiding deity of the planet Mercury who governs intelligence. Matangi is often depicted with a parrot <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> representing speech. The veena symbolizes her association with music.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of her {{grandson}} in August 1963, Calment lived on her own from age 88 until shortly before her 110th birthday, when she decided to move to a nursing home. Her move was precipitated by the winter of 1985 which froze the water pipes in her house (she never used heating in the winter) and caused frostbite <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b> According to one of her doctors, she had hitherto been healthy but began showing signs of senescence (or aging) at this point.|$|E
5|$|In these epochs, she was {{not merely}} {{applying}} ideas and methods of earlier mathematicians; rather, she was crafting new systems of mathematical definitions {{that would be used}} by future mathematicians. In particular, she developed a completely new theory of ideals in rings, generalizing earlier work of Richard Dedekind. She is also renowned for developing ascending chain conditions, a simple finiteness condition that yielded powerful results <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b> Such conditions and the theory of ideals enabled Noether to generalize many older results and to treat old problems from a new perspective, such as elimination theory and the algebraic varieties that had been studied by her father.|$|E

50|$|According to textual descriptions, Jyestha holds a blue {{or white}} lotus <b>in</b> <b>her</b> right <b>hand.</b> A water-pot is held <b>in</b> <b>her</b> left <b>hand</b> or placed near her throne or {{placed in the}} hand that makes the abhaya mudra - gesture of protection. <b>Her</b> left <b>hand</b> usually rests on her seat or on her thigh. Sometimes, Jyestha holds a broom, <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|R
5000|$|One {{tradition}} concerning Mary Magdalene {{says that}} {{following the death}} and resurrection of Jesus, she used her position to gain {{an invitation to a}} banquet given by the Roman Emperor Tiberius. When she met him, she held a plain egg <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> and exclaimed, [...] "Christ is risen!" [...] The Emperor laughed, and said that Christ rising from the dead was as likely as the egg <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> turning red while she held it. Before he finished speaking, the egg <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> turned a bright red and she continued proclaiming the Gospel to the entire imperial house.|$|R
5|$|Stephenie Meyer {{says that}} the idea for Twilight came {{to her in a}} dream on June 2, 2003. The dream was about a human girl, and a vampire who was in love with her but thirsted for her blood. Based on this dream, Meyer wrote the {{transcript}} of what is now chapter 13 of the book. Despite having very little writing experience, in a matter of three months she had transformed that dream into a completed novel. After writing and editing the novel, she signed a three-book deal with Little, Brown and Company for $750,000, an unusually high amount for a first time author. Meyer's literary agent, Jodi Reamer of Writers House, discovered her only because the inexperienced assistant who received Meyer's original letter did not know that young adult books are supposed to be 40,000 to 60,000 words in length, not 130,000 words. Megan Tingley, the Little, Brown editor who signed Meyer, said that halfway through the reading of the Twilight manuscript, she realized that she had a future bestseller <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b> The book was released in 2005.|$|E
5|$|The Vishnudharmottara Purana {{describes}} {{the iconography of}} Vishnu. While the lotus and shankha are held in the upper hands, the lower hands rest on two dwarf figures: the personified gada and chakra. The gada personified as a slim-waisted woman, holds a chamara (chowry) <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> and is adored with ornaments, with Vishnu's right hand resting on her head; chakra stands as a man on Vishnu's left. The personified weapons known as Ayudhapurusha emerge in Gupta era (320–550 CE) sculptures. The personified Kaumodaki {{is also known as}} Gada-devi (the suffix devi means goddess) or Gada-nari ("gada-woman"). Since the Sanskrit word gada is feminine, gada is regarded as a woman. A Gupta Vishnu in Udayagiri Caves depicts Vishnu accompanied by Gadadevi and the personified chakra. Gadadevi often appears in Vishnu images from Kashmir, including Vishnu's four-headed form Vaikuntha Chaturmurti. She holds a chamara and looks in adoration towards her master, whose hand rests on her head. She wears a crown or has an elaborate hairstyle. Apart from a lower garment, she might wear a blouse or have a bare torso. She is depicted emerging from the gada.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} the video was meant to {{illustrate}} the lyrics of the song. It depicts the sexual fantasies of a rich and bored housewife played by Beyoncé who tries to seduce her man while having breakfast at her house wearing a white robe. The video opens with various shots of a big mansion in which the singer is seen {{in one of the}} rooms. She tries to get her man's attention while he reads a newspaper. As he does not notice her, she throws a napkin on the floor and her female servant comes to lift it. The clip transitions to scenes of Beyoncé dressed in a Victorian jeweled outfit with a mask <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> lip-syncing the lyrics and dancing to the rhythm of the song. Afterwards, she is seen entering a limousine in which Jay-Z is already inside. Scenes of Beyoncé with a black coat and lingerie walking in front of the car are also intertwined throughout.|$|E

5|$|Treatises {{such as the}} Vishnudharmottara Purana {{and various}} Agamas {{describe}} the iconography of the ayudhapurushas. Shakti is depicted as a red-hued woman seated on a wolf. The Danda is a fearful black-complexioned man with wrathful red eyes. The Khadga is also a dark and angry man. Pasha is depicted as a male snake with seven hoods. Dhvaja ("banner") is a yellow-coloured strong man with his mouth wide open. The Trishula is a handsome black-complexioned man with lovely eyebrows. The Shankha {{is described as a}} white male with adorable eyes. The Bana (arrow) is a red-coloured man with beautiful eyes, however the Vaikhaashagama describes it to be a black-complexioned eunuch with three eyes, dressed in white clothes and riding on the wind. The Dhanus (bow) is a red lotus coloured female with a stringed bow on her head. The Vishnudharmottara Purana describes Chakra as man with a fat belly and round eyes, decorated with various ornaments and holding a chamara (chowry) and with Vishnu's left hand on his head. The slim-waisted woman Gada holds a chowry <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> and is adored with ornaments, with Vishnu's right hand resting on her head.|$|E
5|$|Susan was {{diagnosed}} with Multiple sclerosis in 2007. Two years prior, MS Australia pitched a storyline to the Neighbours team asking for a character to be diagnosed with MS and for them to then show the impact MS can have on a community. The society contacted a producer and discussed a possible storyline for a young character in her twenties who had a promising career and family ahead of her. In 2006, the society {{received a phone call}} from one of the writers who revealed that they had chosen to write an MS story into the show and they had selected Susan Kennedy to be the character that was going to be diagnosed. The society was initially disappointed, as Susan was older than the typical person diagnosed with the condition. However, they were pleased that a permanent character and not an extra was chosen. MS Australia attended a meeting with the Neighbours writers to help develop a realistic and true portrayal of the diagnosis, symptoms and treatments. On-screen Susan was seen displaying unusual symptoms, including black outs and loss of sight and sensation <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b> She was then seen undergoing an MRI scan, before she {{was diagnosed}} with multiple sclerosis.|$|E

25|$|The oldest {{representations}} of Artemis in Greek Archaic art portray her as Potnia Theron ("Queen of the Beasts"): a winged goddess holding a stag and leopard <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> or sometimes a leopard and a lion.

25|$|Dmitry's {{mother died}} in 1911, at her funeral the grand duke’s poor {{eyesight}} became the source of temporary mirth {{at the end of}} the ceremony when he tried to kiss the icon his mother held <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b> Unable to see clearly, he misjudged the distance and, bending forward to make his farewell, missed the open coffin completely, tumbling off the steps with a loud crash as his ceremonial saber and medals struck the stone floor. Relatives rushed to his side, but the grand duke appeared unfazed and went on as though nothing had happened.|$|E
25|$|The first {{victim was}} her tutor, who carried the letters between them.

Two of the brothers escaped to France but they soon returned with the evident intention of concluding their revenge against Diego who, fearing for his life, hired a bodyguard. The three assassins, {{with the help of}} two uncles and probably fuelled by hatred against Spaniards, killed him in the woods near Noja (today known as Noepoli) several months later.|$|E
25|$|Stafford {{returned}} to the French campaign during the 1430s, and, {{as a result of}} his loyalty and years of service, he was elevated from being Earl of Stafford to Duke of Buckingham. Around the same time, his mother died. As much of his estate had been <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> for life, Humphrey went from having a reduced income in his early years, to being one of the wealthiest and most powerful landowners in England of his generation. His lands stretched across much of the country, ranging from East Anglia to the Welsh border. Being such an important figure in the localities was not without its dangers, and for some time he feuded with, and was being attacked by, Sir Thomas Malory.|$|E
