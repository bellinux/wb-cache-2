5|$|Three {{publishers}} praised The Well {{but turned}} it down. Hall's agent then sent the manuscript to Jonathan Cape who, though cautious about publishing a controversial book, saw {{the potential for}} a commercial success. Cape tested the waters with a small print run of 1500 copies, priced at 15 shillings– about twice the cost of an average novel– to make it less attractive to sensation-seekers. Publication, originally scheduled for late 1928, was brought forward when he discovered that another novel with a lesbian theme, Compton Mackenzie's Extraordinary Women, was to be published in September. Though the two books proved to <b>have</b> <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>common,</b> Hall and Cape saw Extraordinary Women as a competitor and wanted to beat it to market. The Well appeared on 27 July, in a black cover with a plain jacket. Cape sent review copies only to newspapers and magazines he thought would handle the subject matter non-sensationally.|$|E

25|$|Arthur Huntingdon, Helen's abusive and {{alcoholic}} husband, is a Byronic {{figure of}} great fascination {{but also of}} barely concealed moral failings. His abusive behaviour impels Helen {{to run away from}} him, but nevertheless when he becomes ill (after falling from his horse when drunk and injuring his leg badly), Helen returns to Grassdale to take care of him. Unwilling to stop drinking alcohol, Huntingdon deteriorates in health and eventually dies. He is widely thought to be loosely based on the author's brother, Branwell, but some critics have argued that, apart from their masses of red hair, they <b>have</b> <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>common.</b> Along with Lord Lowborough, Huntingdon bears far stronger resemblance to two types of drunkards outlined in Robert Macnish's The Anatomy of Drunkenness.|$|E
25|$|Alternate {{solutions}} proposed at {{the time}} of the Soviet breakup, and still considered viable options by the critics of the Eurasian Region, would be to divide the Region into the previously existing European, Asia-Pacific, or Arab Scout Regions, along cultural lines and national preference, to provide Scouts fresh perspective. As the Baltic states-Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia-have joined the European Region, there is precedence for this solution. In addition, there is no corresponding Eurasian Region for the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts, the republics are divided geographically between WAGGGS' Europe Region and Asia Pacific Region. Besides their shared tsarist and Soviet past, the 12 members of the Eurasian Region <b>have</b> <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>common.</b> Some, like Armenia and Azerbaijan, have waged war on each other, some like Georgia and Ukraine, allow open opposition, while others, like Belarus and Turkmenistan, have turned to authoritarianism reminiscent of Soviet times. Further, as none of the republics have had their Scout movements returned for much more than a decade, it is viewed that they would benefit from the expertise of the neighboring Scout associations in those Regions.|$|E
25|$|Brenda, still {{distressed by}} the fact that Dylan chose Kelly, began the fourth season in Minnesota, where she had decided to enter university. However, hearing about the break between Dylan and Kelly and realizing that she and her old friends from Minnesota <b>have</b> <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>common,</b> she decides to return to Beverly Hills and {{continue}} her studies at University of California. After her return, she met a rich young man named Stuart (whom Dylan knew of as a drug dealer in the past), and soon fell in love with him. The couple get engaged even in the first few weeks of their encounter and choose Las Vegas, forcing Dylan and his friends to come and try to stop them. They succeed by using reverse psychology, pretending that they are in favor of a marriage between the two young people. Brenda's life also took a few shots during the season. When Donna and Brenda find a puppy on the street, they learn that he escaped from an animal testing laboratory and are helpless when the puppy dies. Brenda then falls into a group of animal rights activists and participates with them in the ransacking of a number of laboratories until she is arrested (Donna decides at the last minute not to join the group). After her arrest, {{the only person in the}} group who supported her was Dylan; David Silver questioned her judgment, Andrea was angry that she had damaged laboratories that did not test animals and Kelly told her that Dylan was no longer her boyfriend and that Brenda could not go and look for help whenever she had a problem. It turned out that one of the activists was an FBI agent who offered Brenda a deal not to jail because she had not supported vandalism.|$|E

500|$|The story {{revolves}} around {{two young women}} who seemingly <b>have</b> <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> and do not know of the other's existence at the beginning. The eponymous Madlax is a legendary mercenary and assassin in the fictional civil war-torn country of Gazth-Sonika, who cannot remember her past or indeed her real name before twelve years ago, when the war started. The other main character is Margaret Burton, the sole heir of a wealthy aristocratic family in the peaceful European country Nafrece. Twelve years before the story begins, an airliner Margaret and her mother were on crashed over Gazth-Sonika, and its passengers, as well as Margaret's father who led the rescuers, have been missing ever since. Margaret, however, mysteriously traveled back to Nafrece on her own, losing her memories prior to her return; {{the only thing she}} recalls is a single word, [...] "Madlax". With this thread linking the two girls, they both independently start investigating the powerful crime syndicate Enfant after its enigmatic mastermind shows interest in both of them.|$|E
500|$|Writing in Defining Cult Movies, Jancovich et al. quote {{academic}} Jeffrey Sconce, who defines cult {{films in}} terms of paracinema, marginal films that exist outside critical and cultural acceptance: everything from exploitation to beach party musicals to softcore pornography. [...] However, they reject cult films as having a single unifying feature; instead, they state that cult films are united in their [...] "subcultural ideology" [...] and opposition to mainstream tastes, itself a vague and undefinable term. [...] Cult followings themselves can range from adoration to contempt, and they <b>have</b> <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> except for their celebration of nonconformity – even the bad films ridiculed by fans are artistically nonconformist, albeit unintentionally. [...] At the same time, they state that bourgeois, masculine tastes are frequently reinforced, which makes cult films more of an internal conflict within the bourgeoisie, rather than a rebellion against it. [...] This results in an anti-academic bias despite the use of formal methodologies, such as defamiliarization. [...] This contradiction exists in many subcultures, especially those dependent on defining themselves {{in terms of}} opposition to the mainstream. [...] This nonconformity is eventually co-opted by the dominant forces, such as Hollywood, and marketed to the mainstream. [...] Academic Xavier Mendik also defines cult films as opposing the mainstream and further proposes that films can become cult {{by virtue of their}} genre or content, especially if it is transgressive. [...] Due to their rejection of mainstream appeal, Mendik says cult films can be more creative and political; times of relative political instability produce more interesting films.|$|E

500|$|The idea {{of private}} {{nuisance}} has been criticised by academics {{for at least}} 50 years. Criticism centres on the free rein given to the judiciary {{and the lack of}} concrete definitions for legal principles; the idea of [...] "reasonableness", for examples, is frequently bandied about, but [...] "rarely examined in detail, {{and it would be a}} brave person who would attempt to draw out a definition". While a definition for private nuisance is easy to find, the regularly accepted one does not consider that most private nuisance cases involve two occupiers of land; the [...] "nuisance" [...] has moved from the defendant's land to the claimant's land. Some judicial rationes decidendi, such as that of Lord Wright in Sedleigh-Denfield v O'Callaghan, seem to indicate that private nuisance is only valid in situations where there are two occupiers of land. Despite this, definitions of private nuisance fail to include any reference. Academics also assert that the tort of private nuisance has [...] "lost its separate identity as a strict liability tort and been assimilated in all but name into the fault-based tort of negligence". Conor Gearty supports the assertion that private nuisance is confused, and also claims that private nuisance is significantly different from public nuisance; [...] "they <b>have</b> <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> except the accident of sharing the same name... Private nuisance has, if anything, become even more confused and confusing. Its chapter lies neglected in the standard works, little changed over the years, its modest message overwhelmed by the excitements to be found elsewhere in tort. Any sense of direction which may have existed in the old days is long gone".|$|E
2500|$|It is only {{in later}} {{languages}} that the binary distinction between [...] "strong" [...] and [...] "weak" [...] nouns become more relevant. In Old English, the n-stem nouns form a single, clear class, but the masculine a-stem and feminine ō-stem nouns <b>have</b> <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> with each other, and neither has much similarity to the small class of u-stem nouns. Similarly, in Old Norse, the masculine a-stem and feminine ō-stem nouns <b>have</b> <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> with each other, and the continuations of the masculine an-stem and feminine ōn/īn-stem nouns are also quite distinct. It {{is only in}} Middle Dutch and modern German that the various vowel-stem nouns have merged {{to the point that}} a binary strong/weak distinction clearly applies.|$|E

2500|$|Existentialism saw its apogee {{during the}} years of Borges's {{greatest}} artistic production. It has been argued that his choice of topics largely ignored existentialism's central tenets.
