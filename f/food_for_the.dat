5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the broad-billed parrot may have depended on dodos and Cylindraspis tortoises to eat palm fruits and excrete their seeds, which became <b>food</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> parrots. Anodorhynchus macaws depended on now-extinct South American megafauna in the same way, but now rely on domesticated cattle for this service.|$|E

5|$|The whole {{operation}} took nearly a month. The armies took dried <b>food</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> soldiers and fodder for the horses, {{because of the}} inhospitable conditions.

5|$|Adult solitary wasps mainly feed on nectar, but the {{majority}} of their time is taken up by foraging for food for their carnivorous young, mostly insects or spiders. Apart from providing food for their larval offspring, no maternal care is given. Some wasp species provide <b>food</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> young repeatedly during their development (progressive provisioning). Others, such as potter wasps (Eumeninae) and sand wasps (Ammophila, Sphecidae), repeatedly build nests which they stock with a supply of immobilised prey such as one large caterpillar, laying a single egg in or on its body, and then sealing up the entrance (mass provisioning).|$|E

5|$|Although the South Korean {{government}} did not request international aid, several countries sent aid to the country. A few days after Maemi struck, the United States Agency for International Development sent $50,000 (USD) to the Korean Red Cross. Later, the government of Japan sent ¥9.5million ($85,000 USD) worth of supplies to South Korea, including sleeping mats, generators, and water units. Taiwan also provided $100,000 in aid. The Republic of Korea National Red Cross utilized 700volunteers and 200staff members to distribute food and blankets to 8,190houses, while local offices provided over 5,500meals. Members of <b>Food</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Hungry delivered food and clothing to storm-damaged residents in Masan.|$|E
5|$|Archæological {{evidence}} from the Birrigai rock shelter in Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve indicates habitation dating back at least 21,000 years. It {{is possible that the}} area was inhabited for considerably longer, with evidence of an Aboriginal presence in south-western New South Wales dating back around 40,000–62,000 years. Another site of significance in the reserve is the Bogong Rocks shelter, which contains the oldest evidence of Aboriginal occupation at a bogong moth resting site. These insects were an important source of <b>food</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Aboriginal peoples of the Southern Alps and would accumulate by the thousands in caves and rock crevices, where they were collected and later roasted in sand or ashes, and then eaten whole.|$|E
5|$|As senior officer, Lamason {{had access}} to the main camp and quickly built a rapport with the group.

Both men had developed trustworthy contacts within the camp administrative area and were able to provide Lamason with reliable intelligence that assisted in the survival of the airmen.|$|E

5|$|As time passes, {{with no sign}} of land {{or other}} ships, Parker {{suggests}} that one of them should be killed as <b>food</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> others.

This gives the others a reprieve, but Augustus soon dies from wounds received when they reclaimed the Grampus, and several more storms batter the already badly damaged ship. Pym and Peters float on the upturned hull and are close to death when they are rescued by the Jane Guy, a ship out of Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian cuisine has ancient roots, with {{evidence}} that, for example, cheese {{has been made}} in Egypt since at least 3,000 BC. Ful medames, a stew of fava beans with oil and cumin, is popular in Egypt and has become widespread across the Arab world. Duqqa is a dip made of pounded herbs, hazelnuts and spices, eaten with bread. Kushari is a foreign-derived 19th century dish of rice, lentils and pasta, variously garnished; it began as <b>food</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> poor, but has become a national dish.|$|E
5|$|Eusociality {{involves}} cooperative {{brood care}} (including brood care of offspring from other individuals), overlapping generations within {{a colony of}} adults, and a division of labour into reproductive and non-reproductive groups. Few organisms outside Hymenoptera exhibit this behavior; the only beetle {{to do so is}} the weevil Austroplatypus incompertus. This Australian species lives in horizontal networks of tunnels, in the heartwood of Eucalyptus trees. It is one of more than 300 species of wood-boring Ambrosia beetles which distribute the spores of ambrosia fungi. The fungi grow in the beetles' tunnels, providing <b>food</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> beetles and their larvae; female offspring remain in the tunnels and maintain the fungal growth, probably never reproducing. Cooperative brood care is also found in the bess beetles (Passalidae) where the larvae feed on the semi-digested faeces of the adults.|$|E

5|$|Filming {{began at}} P. C. Sreeram's house in Alwarpet. Although {{the film was}} {{primarily}} set indoors in Delhi, Ratnam and Sreeram wanted the indoor scenes to look as lively as those shot outdoors. Since the cast was relatively small, Ratnam did not want it to resemble a play and used backlighting for the interior scenes. Thotta Tharani found {{a house in the}} residential area of Kilpauk in Madras (now Chennai) which admitted a great deal of sunlight, making it similar to houses in Delhi. Mouna Ragam was Ratnam's first film to make extensive use of staccato dialogue; this became his trademark style in later films. To reduce production costs, <b>food</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> film's crew was cooked at Venkateswaran's home.|$|E
5|$|Fishing was an {{important}} source of <b>food</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> monks of Glastonbury Abbey. Fishing was carried out in artificial ponds, which were mentioned at Meare in the Domesday Book and from the River Brue and Meare Pool. The present rectangular stone building was constructed by the abbot between 1322 and 1335 for the storage and processing of the fish and as a residence for the chief fisherman. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries the building fell into disrepair and it was seriously damaged by fire in the 1880s. Some restoration has been undertaken during the 20th century, including the replacement of the roof in the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Hess {{was moved}} to Maindiff Court Hospital on 26 June 1942, where he {{remained}} {{for the next three}} years. The facility was chosen for its added security and the need for fewer guards. Hess was allowed walks on the grounds and car trips into the surrounding countryside. He had access to newspapers and other reading materials; he wrote letters and journals. His mental health remained under the care of Dr Rees. Hess continued to complain on and off of memory loss and made a second suicide attempt on 4 February 1945, when he stabbed himself with a bread knife. The wound was not serious, requiring two stitches. Despondent that Germany was losing the war, he took no <b>food</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> next week, only resuming eating when he was threatened with being force-fed.|$|E

5|$|In 1878, the Bannock {{people and}} {{northern}} Shoshone tribes {{participated in the}} Bannock War, a war against white settlers in the region over the destruction of camas root — {{a major source of}} <b>food</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> natives — by white settlers' hogs. The Bannock and the Northern Paiute suffered from violence during the conflict, and once the white settlers had won the war, the natives were allotted into various reservations.

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the hurricane, the road {{networks}} of the affected countries remained severely disrupted for extended periods of time, hampering relief efforts in badly flooded regions. Government and emergency officials opened shelters and distributed <b>food</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> thousands that had lost their homes or sources of income. Throughout Central America and Mexico, 116people lost their lives and 16 others went missing. The disaster left swaths of private property, infrastructure, and farmland in complete ruins, leading to damage costs of more than $170million (1993USD).|$|E
5|$|On May 5, 1974 {{author and}} {{journalist}} Arthur Koestler published {{a letter from}} reader Nigel Parker in The Sunday Times of a striking coincidence between a scene in Poe's novel and an actual event that happened decades later: In 1884, the yacht Mignonette sank, with four men cast adrift. After weeks without food, they decided {{that one of them}} should be sacrificed as <b>food</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> other three, just as in Poe's novel. The loser was a young cabin boy named Richard Parker, coincidentally the same name as Poe's fictional character.
