40|$|Generation time is an {{important}} determinant of a neutral molecular clock.

Therefore, humans may exhibit a significantly slower molecular clock as compared to other <b>hominoids.</b> To investigate this hypothesis, we performed a large-scale analysis of lineage-specific rates of single-nucleotide substitutions among <b>hominoids.</b> We found that humans indeed exhibit a significant slowdown of molecular evolution compared to chimpanzees and other <b>hominoids.</b> However, the amount of fixed differences between humans and chimpanzees appears extremely small, suggesting a very recent evolution of human-specific life history traits.

25|$|Fossil {{evidence}} suggests that humans' earliest hominid ancestors may have split from other primates {{as early as the}} late Oligocene, circa 26 to 24 Ma, and that by the early Miocene, the adaptive radiation of many different <b>hominoid</b> forms was well underway. Evidence from the molecular dating of genetic differences indicates that the gibbon lineage (family Hylobatidae) diverged between 18 and 12 Ma, and the orangutan lineage (subfamily Ponginae) diverged about 12 Ma. While there is no fossil evidence thus far clearly documenting the early ancestry of gibbons, fossil proto-orangutans may be represented by Sivapithecus from India and Griphopithecus from Turkey, dated to around 10 Ma. Molecular evidence further suggests that between 8 and 4 Ma, first the gorillas, and then the chimpanzee (genus Pan) split from the line leading to the humans. We have no fossil record of this divergence, but distinctively hominid fossils have been found dating to 3.2 Ma (see Lucy) and possibly even earlier, at 6 or 7 Ma (see Toumaï). Comparisons of DNA show that 99.4 percent of the coding regions are identical in chimpanzees and humans (95–96% overall), which is taken as strong evidence of recent common ancestry. Today, only one distinct human species survives, but many earlier species have been found in the fossil record, including Homo erectus, Homo habilis, and Homo neanderthalensis.|$|E

40|$|<b>Hominoids</b> and lorines {{are assumed}} to possess greater {{shoulder}} mobility than other primates. This assumption is based on morphological characteristics of the shoulder, rather than on empirical data. However, {{recent studies have shown}} that the glenohumeral joint of <b>hominoids</b> is not more mobile than that of other primates (Chan LK. 2007. Glenohumeral mobility in primates. Folia Primatol (Basel) 78 (1) : 1 - 18), and the thoracic shape of <b>hominoids</b> does not necessarily promote shoulder mobility (Chan LK. 2007. Scapular position in primates. Folia Primatol (Basel) 78 (1) : 19 - 35). Moreover, lorines differ significantly from <b>hominoids</b> in both these features, thus challenging the assumption that both <b>hominoids</b> and lorines have greater shoulder mobility. The present study aims to test this assumption by collecting empirical data on shoulder mobility in 17 primate species. Passive arm circumduction (a combination of glenohumeral and pectoral girdle movement) was performed on sedated subjects (except humans), and the range measured on the video images of the circumduction. The motion differed among primate species mostly in the craniodorsal directions, the directions most relevant to the animal's ability to brachiate and slow climb. Hylobatids possessed the highest craniodorsal mobility among all primate species studied. However, nonhylobatid <b>hominoids</b> did not have greater craniodorsal mobility than arboreal quadrupedal monkeys, and lorines did not have greater craniodorsal mobility than arboreal quadrupedal prosimians. Nonhylobatid <b>hominoids</b> and lorines had similar craniodorsal mobility, but this was due to a longer clavicle, more dorsal scapula, and lower glenohumeral mobility in the former, and a shorter clavicle, less dorsal scapula, and greater glenohumeral mobility in the latter. This study provides evidence for the reexamination of the brachiation, slow climbing, and vertical climbing hypotheses. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|In <b>hominoids,</b> {{the broad}} thorax has been assumed to {{contribute}} to their dorsal scapular position. However, the dorsoventral diameter of their cranial thorax was found in one study to be longer in <b>hominoids.</b> There are insufficient data on thoracic shape to explain the relationship between broad thorax and dorsal scapular position. The current study presents data on multilevel cross-sectional shape and volume distribution {{in a range of}} primates. Biplanar radiographs of intact fluid-preserved cadavers were taken to measure the cross-sectional shape of ten equally spaced levels through the sternum (called decisternal levels) and the relative volume of the nine intervening thoracic segments. It was found that the cranial thorax of <b>hominoids</b> is larger and broader (except in the first two decisternal levels) than that of other primates. The cranial thorax of <b>hominoids</b> has a longer dorsoventral diameter because the increase in dorsoventral diameter caused by the increase in the volume of the cranial thorax overcompensates for the decrease caused by the broadening of the cranial thorax. The larger and broader cranial thorax in <b>hominoids</b> can be explained as a locomotor adaptation for scapular gliding and as a respiratory adaptation for reducing the effects of orthograde posture on ventilation-perfusion inequality. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

This study examines cross-sectional geometry (CA and J) of metacarpals II-V and metatarsals I-V at 50 % length across a sample (N= 86) of chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and humans. 	 All cross-sectional variables are analyzed against bone length, body mass, and (body mass x bone length). RMA lines are calculated. ANOVA is performed as well as post-hoc comparisons using the Tukey’s honestly significant difference for unequal samples. The “Quick test” by Tsutakawa and Hewett (1977) and the calculation of the percent prediction error (PPE) are used to evaluate differences between species. 	This is the first attempt to give a biomechanical interpretation to both metacarpals and metatarsals within <b>hominoids</b> and to {{shed some light on}} their relationship with locomotion behaviors. Good results in characterizing the <b>hominoids</b> in relation to locomotion behavior are obtained when hands and feet are analyzed separately, but the best results are obtained comparing metacarpals and metatarsals of the same ray. It appears that knuckle-walker apes have a relative stronger metacarpal III and especially IV as compared to the other <b>hominoids,</b> and that humans have a relative stronger metatarsal V as compared to great apes. Interestingly, orangutans, which perform a quadrumanus arboreal behavior, have a relative metacarpal IV robustness between range of the knuckle-walkers and that of humans. On the whole metacarpal and metatarsal cross-sectional characteristics are strongly related to the locomotion behavior of <b>hominoids,</b> and may be useful in elucidating locomotion characteristics of fossil <b>hominoids...</b>|$|R

40|$|Technological and {{conceptual}} breakthroughs {{have led to}} more serious consideration of the cerebellum as an essential element in cognition. Recent studies show the lateral cerebellum, seat of the neocerebellum, to be most active in cognitive tasks. An examination of the relative volumes of the cerebellar hemispheres in anthropoids would reveal whether some groups show greater neocerebellar development through hemispheric expansion beyond expected allometry, implying a greater contribution of the lateral hemispheres to cognition. This study expands the existing data on primate brain and brain part volumes by incorporating data from both magnetic resonance scans and histological sections for a total sample size of 97 specimens, including 42 apes, 14 humans and 41 monkeys. The resulting volumes of whole brain, cerebellum, vermis, and hemisphere enable a reliable linear regression contrast between <b>hominoids</b> and monkeys, and demonstrate a striking increase in the lateral cerebellum in <b>hominoids.</b> The uniformity of the grade shift suggests that this increase {{took place in the}} common ancestor to the <b>hominoids.</b> The importance of the neocerebellum in visual-spatial skills, planning of complex movements, procedural learning, attention switching, and sensory discrimination in manipulation would facilitate the adaptation of these early <b>hominoids</b> to frugivory and suspensory feeding.
