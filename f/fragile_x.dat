5|$|Secondary {{causes of}} tics (not related to {{inherited}} Tourette syndrome) are {{commonly referred to}} as tourettism. Dystonias, choreas, other genetic conditions, and secondary causes of tics should be ruled out in the differential diagnosis for Tourette syndrome. Other conditions that may manifest tics or stereotyped movements include developmental disorders, autism spectrum disorders, and stereotypic movement disorder; Sydenham's chorea; idiopathic dystonia; and genetic conditions such as Huntington's disease, neuroacanthocytosis, Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Wilson's disease, and tuberous sclerosis. Other possibilities include chromosomal disorders such as Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, XYY syndrome and <b>fragile</b> <b>X</b> syndrome. Acquired causes of tics include drug-induced tics, head trauma, encephalitis, stroke, and carbon monoxide poisoning. The symptoms of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome may also be confused with Tourette syndrome. Most of these conditions are rarer than tic disorders, and a thorough history and examination may be enough to rule them out, without medical or screening tests.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fragile</b> <b>X</b> {{syndrome}} is typically {{due to an}} expansion of the CGG triplet repeat within the <b>Fragile</b> <b>X</b> mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene on the X chromosome. This results in not enough <b>fragile</b> <b>X</b> mental retardation protein (FMRP), which is required for normal development of the connection between neurons. Diagnosis is by genetic testing to determine the number of CGG repeats in the FMRI gene. Normal is between 5 and 40 repeats, <b>fragile</b> <b>X</b> syndrome occurs with more than 200, and a premutation is said to be present when a middle number of repeats occur. Testing for premutation carriers may allow for genetic counseling.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fragile</b> <b>X</b> {{syndrome}} co-occurs {{with autism}} {{in many cases}} and is a suspected genetic cause of the autism in these cases. This finding has resulted in screening for FMR1 mutation to be considered mandatory in children diagnosed with autism. Of those with <b>fragile</b> <b>X</b> syndrome, prevalence of concurrent autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been estimated to be between 15 and 60%, with the variation {{due to differences in}} diagnostic methods and the high frequency of autistic features in individuals with <b>fragile</b> <b>X</b> syndrome not meeting the DSM criteria for an ASD.|$|E
25|$|Cognitive {{disorders}} such as ADHD, autism, intellectual disability, and <b>fragile</b> <b>X</b> syndrome, may be resultant from abnormalities in dendritic spines, {{especially the}} number of spines and their maturity. The ratio of matured to immature spines is important in their signaling, as immature spines have impaired synaptic signaling. <b>Fragile</b> <b>X</b> syndrome is characterized by an overabundance of immature spines that have multiple filopodia in cortical dendrites.|$|E

25|$|<b>Fragile</b> <b>X</b> {{syndrome}} is a genetic disorder which occurs {{as a result}} of a mutation of the <b>fragile</b> <b>X</b> mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene on the X chromosome, most commonly an increase in the number of CGG trinucleotide repeats in the 5' untranslated region of FMR1. Mutation at that site is found in 1 out of about every 2000 males and 1 out of about every 259 females. Incidence of the disorder itself is about 1 in every 3600 males and 1 in 4000–6000 females. Although this accounts for over 98% of cases, FXS can also occur as a result of point mutations affecting FMR1.|$|E
25|$|The {{disorder}} {{should be}} differentiated from several other conditions, especially centrotemporal spikes without seizures, centrotemporal spikes with local brain pathology, central spikes in Rett syndrome and <b>fragile</b> <b>X</b> syndrome, malignant Rolandic epilepsy, temporal lobe epilepsy and Landau-Kleffner syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Additional RISC {{components}} include TRBP , PACT (protein activator of the interferon-induced protein kinase), the SMN complex, <b>fragile</b> <b>X</b> {{mental retardation}} protein (FMRP), Tudor staphylococcal nuclease-domain-containing protein (Tudor-SN), the putative DNA helicase MOV10, and the RNA recognition motif containing protein TNRC6B.|$|E
25|$|Other {{problems}} {{to be considered in}} the differential diagnosis include selective mutism, stereotypic movement disorder and bipolar disorder as well as traumatic brain injury or birth trauma, conduct disorder, Cornelia De Lange syndrome, fetal alcohol syndrome, <b>fragile</b> <b>X</b> syndrome, dyslexia, Fahr syndrome, hyperlexia, leukodystrophy, multiple sclerosis and Triple X syndrome.|$|E
25|$|There is no cure. Early {{intervention}} is recommended as {{it provides the}} most opportunity for developing {{a full range of}} skills. These interventions may include special education, speech therapy, physical therapy, or behavioral therapy. Medications may be used to treat associated seizures, mood problems, or ADHD. <b>Fragile</b> <b>X</b> syndrome occurs in about 1 in 4,000 males and 1 in 8,000 females.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fragile</b> <b>X</b> {{syndrome}} (FXS) is {{a genetic}} disorder. Symptoms often include {{mild to moderate}} intellectual disability. Physical features may include a long and narrow face, large ears, flexible fingers, and large testicles. About a third of people have features of autism such as problems with social interactions and delayed speech. Hyperactivity is common and seizures occur in about 10%. Males are usually more affected than females.|$|E
25|$|Children with <b>fragile</b> <b>X</b> {{have very}} short {{attention}} spans, are hyperactive, and show hypersensitivity to visual, auditory, tactile, and olfactory stimuli. These children have difficulty in large crowds {{due to the}} loud noises and {{this can lead to}} tantrums due to hyperarousal. Children with FXS pull away from light touch and can find textures of materials to be irritating. Transitions from one location to another can be difficult for children with FXS. Behavioral therapy can be used to decrease the child’s sensitivity in some cases.|$|E
25|$|For {{more than}} 12 years, {{scientists}} {{have noticed that}} some individuals with autism also have idic(15). In fact, idic(15) is the most frequently identified chromosome problem in individuals with autism. (A chromosome anomaly involves extra or missing chromosomal material, not changes within the genes such as <b>Fragile</b> <b>X</b> syndrome). It is suggested that the co-occurrence of autism and idic(15) is not by chance. There may be a gene or genes in the 15q11-q13 region that is/are related {{to the development of}} autism in some individuals.|$|E
25|$|Among other positions, Edwards was {{generally}} pro-choice and supported {{affirmative action and}} the death penalty. One of his first sponsored bills was the <b>Fragile</b> <b>X</b> Research Breakthrough Act of 1999. He {{was also the first}} person to introduce comprehensive anti-spyware legislation with the Spyware Control and Privacy Protection Act. He advocated rolling back the Bush administration's tax cuts and ending mandatory minimum sentencing for non-violent offenders. Edwards generally supported expanding legal immigration to the United States while working with Mexico to provide better border security and stop illegal trafficking.|$|E
25|$|Most young {{children}} do not show any physical signs of FXS. It is not until puberty that physical features of FXS begin to develop. Aside from intellectual disability, prominent characteristics of the syndrome may include an elongated face, large or protruding ears, flat feet, larger testes (macroorchidism), and low muscle tone. Recurrent otitis media (middle ear infection) and sinusitis is common during early childhood. Speech may be cluttered or nervous. Behavioral characteristics may include stereotypic movements (e.g., hand-flapping) and atypical social development, particularly shyness, limited eye contact, memory problems, and difficulty with face encoding. Some individuals with <b>fragile</b> <b>X</b> syndrome also meet the diagnostic criteria for autism.|$|E
25|$|PGD is {{available}} for {{a large number of}} monogenic disorders—that is, disorders due to a single gene only (autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant or X-linked)—or of chromosomal structural aberrations (such as a balanced translocation). PGD helps these couples identify embryos carrying a genetic disease or a chromosome abnormality, thus avoiding diseased offspring. The most frequently diagnosed autosomal recessive disorders are cystic fibrosis, Beta-thalassemia, sickle cell disease and spinal muscular atrophy type 1. The most common dominant diseases are myotonic dystrophy, Huntington's disease and Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease; {{and in the case of}} the X-linked diseases, most of the cycles are performed for <b>fragile</b> <b>X</b> syndrome, haemophilia A and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Though it is quite infrequent, some centers report PGD for mitochondrial disorders or two indications simultaneously.|$|E
25|$|Emory University {{research}} is heavily {{funded by the}} United States Department of Health and Human Services's National Institutes of Health. The federal agency awarded the university nearly $300 million {{in the fiscal year}} of 2015. In 2015, Emory University was one of four institutions selected by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for its seven-year, multimillion-dollar Tuberculosis Research Units (TBRU) program, which aims to drive innovation in tuberculosis research and reduce the global burden of the disease. In 2015, an Emory-led research consortium received a five-year, 15 million dollar grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to research human immune responses to Varicella zoster virus and pneumococcal vaccination. The university also received a $9 million grant over five years from the NIH to support one of three national Centers for Collaborative Research in <b>Fragile</b> <b>X</b> syndrome. The grant is a renewal of Emory’s National <b>Fragile</b> <b>X</b> Research Center, continuously funded by the NIH for more than 10 years. In 2015, the university received a $8.9 million grant over five years from the NIH National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute(NHLBI) to better understand the role of reactive oxygen species and inflammation in blood vessel function and to explore new interventions and preventive approaches for atherosclerosis and aortic aneurysms. In 2015, the university received a $8 million grant over five years from the NIH to develop and validate mathematical models of how prior immunity affects recall immune responses to influenza viruses. The researchers will create and disseminate powerful, user-friendly modeling tools for use by the wider research community in developing more effective vaccines. In 2015, the university received a $3.6 million grant over five years from the NIH {{to examine the effects of}} maternal stress on brain function, development, and behavior in African-American infants, including the biochemical connection between the brain and the microbiome. In 2015, the university received a $3.5 million grant over five years from the NIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) for an Informatics Technology for Cancer Research award. Winship Cancer Institute and Emory School of Medicine researchers will develop software tools to help the cancer research community gain new insights from cancer imaging “big data” and develop new open-source cancer research applications. In 2015, the university received a $3.4 million grant from the NIH International Collaborations in Infectious Disease Research Program to support a partnership between the Emory Vaccine Center and the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB) in New Delhi, India to study dengue virus infection in India.|$|E
25|$|Mutations {{in these}} repeating {{segments}} {{can affect the}} {{physical and chemical properties}} of proteins, with the potential for producing gradual and predictable changes in protein action. For example, length changes in tandemly repeating regions in the Runx2 gene lead to differences in facial length in domesticated dogs (Canis familiaris), with an association between longer sequence lengths and longer faces. This association also applies to a wider range of Carnivora species. Length changes in polyalanine tracts within the HoxA13 gene are linked to Hand-Foot-Genital Syndrome, a developmental disorder in humans. Length changes in other triplet repeats are linked to more than 40 neurological diseases in humans, notably triplet expansion diseases such as <b>fragile</b> <b>X</b> syndrome and Huntington's disease. Evolutionary changes from replication slippage also occur in simpler organisms. For example, microsatellite length changes are common within surface membrane proteins in yeast, providing rapid evolution in cell properties. Specifically, length changes in the FLO1 gene control the level of adhesion to substrates. Short sequence repeats also provide rapid evolutionary change to surface proteins in pathenogenic bacteria; this may allow them to keep up with immunological changes in their hosts. Length changes in short sequence repeats in a fungus (Neurospora crassa) control the duration of its circadian clock cycles.|$|E
500|$|Along {{with this}} research, Fischbach {{and his colleagues}} at the Simons Foundation are {{studying}} diseases that have autistic features, such as Rett syndrome and <b>Fragile</b> <b>X</b> syndrome. [...] The hope is that a better understanding of the central role of the synapse in autistic symptoms can be discovered as well as which specific regions of the brain are responsible for these behaviors. [...] Within the next decade, the ultimate goal of this research is to determine the precise neural circuitry involved in autism and how it translates to the autistic behaviors displayed.|$|E

2500|$|It {{was later}} alleged that Daniel had <b>Fragile</b> <b>X</b> syndrome, {{and that this}} was the cause of {{domestic}} problems in the Benoit family. It was also suggested that needle marks on Daniel's arms were the result of growth hormones given to him because Benoit and his family considered him undersized due to <b>Fragile</b> <b>X.</b> Benoit's coworker and best friend, wrestler Chris Jericho, stated that from his own research on the condition, the symptoms [...] "fit Daniel to a tee, all across the board". With regard to those who had publicly stated that they had no knowledge of Daniel having the condition, Jericho said, [...] "If Chris had decided that he wanted to keep it to himself, you wouldn't have been able to pry that out of him with anything." [...] Despite Chris Jericho's initial statements regarding Daniel, he later stated in his 2011 book Undisputed, [...] "It turned out that Daniel didn't have <b>Fragile</b> <b>X,</b> but at the time it made sense because I was grasping at straws." ...|$|E

2500|$|About 20% {{of women}} who are {{carriers}} for the <b>fragile</b> <b>X</b> premutation are affected by fragile X-related primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI), which is defined as menopause before the age of 40. [...] The number of CGG repeats correlates with penetrance and age of onset. [...] However premature menopause is more common in premutation carriers than in women with the full mutation, and for premutations with more than 100 repeats the risk of FXPOI begins to decrease. [...] Fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) is one of three Fragile X-associated Disorders (FXD) caused by changes in the FMR1 gene.FXPOI affects female premutation carriers of <b>Fragile</b> <b>X</b> syndrome, which is caused by the FMR1 gene, when their ovaries are not functioning properly. [...] Women with FXPOI may develop menopause-like symptoms but they are not actually menopausal. [...] Women with FXPOI can still get pregnant in some cases because their ovaries occasionally release viable eggs.|$|E

2500|$|The age {{at which}} CP is {{diagnosed}} is important, but there is disagreement over {{what is the best}} age to make the diagnosis. The earlier CP is diagnosed correctly, the better the opportunities are to provide the child with physical and education help, but there might be a greater chance that CP will be confused with another problem, especially if the child is 18 months of age or younger. Infants may have temporary problems with muscle tone or control that can be confused with CP, which is permanent. A metabolism disorder or tumors in the nervous system may appear to be CP; metabolic disorders, in particular, can produce brain problems that look like CP on an MRI. Disorders that deteriorate the white matter in the brain and problems that cause spasms and weakness in the legs, may be mistaken for CP when they first appear early in life. However, these disorders get worse over time, and CP does not (although it may change in character). In infancy it may not be possible {{to tell the difference between}} them. In the UK, not being able to sit independently by the age of 8 months is regarded as a clinical sign for further monitoring. [...] <b>Fragile</b> <b>X</b> syndrome (a cause of autism and intellectual disability) and general intellectual disability must also be ruled out. Cerebral palsy specialist John McLaughlin recommends waiting until the child is 36 months of age before making a diagnosis, because by that age, motor capacity is easier to assess.|$|E
2500|$|In 1998 the Silva {{laboratory}} {{moved to}} the Department of Neurobiology at the UCLA School of Medicine. There, the laboratory [...] bridged their growing involvement in animal models of cognitive disorders with clinical studies. Additionally, UCLA's large and highly collaborative neuroscience community was an ideal environment for the interdisciplinary studies that characterized work in the Silva laboratory. [...] The Silva laboratory became more involved in studying molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for cognitive deficits in genetic neurodevelopmental disorders. In the late nineties, cognitive deficits associated with this class of disorders {{were thought to be}} caused by genetic disruptions of brain development [...] Animal model studies of Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) in the Silva lab suggested that the learning and memory deficits associated with NF1 mutations are caused by changes in synaptic plasticity mechanisms in adults. Accordingly, a project led by Rui M. Costa in the Silva Lab demonstrated that the electrophysiological, and more importantly the behavioral deficits, caused by NF1 mutations could be reversed in adults by manipulations that corrected the molecular signaling deficits associated with these mutations. This discovery, and a series of later studies in many laboratories worldwide, have demonstrated the surprising efficacy of adult interventions in reversing cognitive phenotypes in animal models of neurodevelopmental disorders. Following the NF1 studies published in 2002 by the Silva laboratory, other findings that reported adult rescue of neurodevelopment disorders include, for example, animal studies of Lhermitte-Duclos disease [...] and Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome in 2003, <b>Fragile</b> <b>X</b> syndrome in 2005, Down syndrome in 2007, Rett syndrome [...] and Angelman syndrome in 2007, Tuberous Sclerosis in 2008.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fragile</b> <b>X</b> {{syndrome}} {{is the most}} common inherited form of intellectual disability.
