40|$|Background Electroporation is {{currently}} receiving much attention {{as a way}} to increase drug and DNA delivery. Recent studies demonstrated the feasibility of electrogene therapy using a range of therapeutic genes for the treatment of experimental tumors. However, the transfection efficiency of electroporation-assisted DNA delivery is still low compared to viral methods and there is a clear need to optimize this approach. In order to optimize treatment, knowledge about spatial and time dependency of gene expression following delivery is of utmost importance in order to improve gene delivery. Intravital microscopy of tumors growing in dorsal skin <b>fold</b> <b>window</b> chambers is a useful method for monitoring gene transfection, since it allows non-invasive dynamic monitoring of gene expression in tumors in a live animal. Methods Intravital microscopy was used to monitor real time spatial distribution of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and time dependence of transfection efficiency in syngeneic P 22 rat tumor model.

40|$|Blood {{oxygenation}} mapping by {{the means}} of optical oximetry is of significant importance in clinical trials. This paper uses hyperspectral imaging technology to obtain in vivo images for blood oxygenation detection. The experiment involves dorsal skin <b>fold</b> <b>window</b> chamber preparation which was built on adult (8 - 10 weeks of age) female BALB/c nu/nu mice and in vivo image acquisition which was performed by hyperspectral imaging system. To get the accurate spatial and spectral information of targets, an automatic registration scheme is proposed. An adaptive feature detection method which combines the local threshold method and the level-set filter is presented to extract target vessels. A reliable feature matching algorithm with the correlative information inherent in hyperspectral images is used to kick out the outliers. Then, the registration images are used for blood oxygenation mapping. Registration evaluation results show {{that most of the}} false matches are removed and the smooth and concentrated spectra are obtained. This intensity invariant feature detection with outliers-removing feature matching proves to be effective in hyperspectral vessel image registration. Therefore, in vivo hyperspectral imaging system by the assistance of the proposed registration scheme provides a technique for blood oxygenation research...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} feature of tumor hypoxia is its temporal instability, or “cycling hypoxia. ” The primary consequence of cycling hypoxia is increased tumor aggressiveness and treatment resistance beyond that of chronic hypoxia. Longitudinal imaging of tumor metabolic demand, hemoglobin oxygen saturation, and blood flow would provide valuable insight into the mechanisms and distribution of cycling hypoxia in tumors. Fluorescence imaging of metabolic demand via the optical redox ratio (fluorescence intensity of FAD∕NADH), absorption microscopy of hemoglobin oxygen saturation, and Doppler optical coherence tomography of vessel morphology and blood flow are combined to noninvasively monitor changes in oxygen supply and demand in the mouse dorsal skin <b>fold</b> <b>window</b> chamber tumor model (human squamous cell carcinoma) every 6 h for 36 h. Biomarkers for metabolic demand, blood oxygenation, and blood flow are all found to significantly change with time (p< 0. 05). These variations in oxygen supply and demand are superimposed on a significant (p< 0. 05) decline in metabolic demand with distance from the nearest vessel in tumors (this gradient was not observed in normal tissues). Significant (p< 0. 05), but weak (r⩽ 0. 5) correlations are found between the hemoglobin oxygen saturation, blood flow, and redox ratio. These results indicate that cycling hypoxia depends on both oxygen supply and demand, and that noninvasive optical imaging could be a valuable tool to study therapeutic strategies to mitigate cycling hypoxia, thus increasing the effectiveness of radiation and chemotherapy...|$|R
50|$|The {{foundation}} of the home is built entirely of stone in, for Kahn, a traditional style of building. The stone foundation was necessary due to the home’s placement on a slope and its need for a solid anchoring into the ground of the site. The exterior and interior portions of the home are made from the same cedar wood sourced from the local Pennsylvania area. This was done to keep down costs. The woodwork of the Fisher house is often viewed as the most comprehensive of any of his woodwork during the period. Later projects were said to lack {{the continuity of the}} Fisher House, often smaller details such as interior doors were left unadorned in a way that left the project feeling incomplete to viewers. It was best in the end that Kahn was not allowed to build from all stone, because if he had the home would have been lacking in much of the great detail work that makes it so famous. The use of cedar wood throughout the interior and exterior of the home compelled Kahn to create amazing details in the building simply by <b>folding</b> <b>windows</b> into the building envelope to provide new habitable space on both the interior and exterior of the building. Had Kahn been left to build the Fisher House entirely from stone on the exterior then the details he created from windows never would have come into existence.|$|R
60|$|Popham Villa was {{the name}} of the house at Fulham,--as was to be seen by all men passing by, for it was painted up conspicuously on the pillars through which the gate led into the garden. Mr. Underwood, when he had first taken the place, had wished to expunge the name, feeling it to be cockneyfied, pretentious, and unalluring. But Mrs. Underwood had rather liked it, and it remained. It was a subject of ridicule with the two girls; but they had never ventured to urge its withdrawal, and after his wife's death Sir Thomas never alluded to the subject. Popham Villa it was, therefore, and there the words remained. The house was unpretentious, {{containing}} only two sitting-rooms besides a small side closet,--for it could hardly be called more,--which the girls even in their mother's lifetime had claimed as their own. But the drawing-room was as pretty as room could be, opening on to the lawn with <b>folding</b> <b>windows,</b> and giving a near view of the bright river as it flowed by, with just a glimpse of the bridge.

DNA alone, liposome-DNA complexes and electroporation-assisted DNA delivery using two different sets of electric pulse parameters were compared. Results Electroporation-assisted DNA delivery using 8 pulses, 600 V/cm, 5 ms, 1 Hz was superior to other methods and resulted in 22 % increase in fluorescence intensity in the tumors up to 6 days post-transfection, compared to the non-transfected area in granulation tissue. Functional GFP was detected within 5 h after transfection. Cells expressing GFP were detected throughout the tumor, but not in the surrounding tissue that was not exposed to electric pulses. Conclusions Intravital microscopy was demonstrated to be a suitable method for monitoring time and spatial distribution of gene expression in experimental tumors and provided evidence that electroporation-assisted gene delivery using 8 pulses, 600 V/cm, 5 ms, 1 Hz is an effective method, resulting in early onset and homogenous distribution of gene expression in the syngeneic P 22 rat tumor model. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objective: Foslip (R) and Fospeg (R) are {{liposomal}} {{formulations of}} the photosensitizer mTHPC, {{intended for use}} in Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) of malignancies. Foslip consists of mTHPC encapsulated in conventional liposomes, Fospeg consists of mTHPC encapsulated in pegylated liposomes. Possible differences in tumor fluorescence and vasculature kinetics between Foslip, Fospeg, and Foscan (R) were studied using the rat window-chamber model. Material and Methods: In 18 rats a dorsal skin <b>fold</b> <b>window</b> chamber was installed and a mammary carcinoma was transplanted in the subcutaneous tissue. The dosage used for intravenous injection was 0. 15 mg/kg mTHPC for each formulation. At seven time-points after injection (5 minutes to 96 hours) fluorescence images were made with a CCD. The achieved mTHPC fluorescence images were corrected for tissue optical properties and autofluorescence by the ratio fluorescence imaging technique of Kascakova et al. Fluorescence intensities of three different regions of interest (ROI) were assessed; tumor tissue, vasculature, and surrounding connective tissue. Results: The three mTHPC formulations showed marked differences in their fluorescence kinetic profile. After injection, vascular mTHPC fluorescence increased for Foslip and Fospeg but decreased for Foscan. Maximum tumor fluorescence is reached at 8 hours for Fospeg and at 24 hours for Foscan and Foslip with overall higher fluorescence for both liposomal formulations. Foscan showed {{no significant difference in}} fluorescence intensity between surrounding tissue and tumor tissue (selectivity). However, Fospeg showed a trend toward tumor selectivity at early time points, while Foslip reached a significant difference (P < 0. 05) at these time points. Conclusions: Our results showed marked differences in fluorescence intensities of Fospeg, Foslip, and Foscan, which suggest overall higher bioavailability for the liposomal formulations. Pegylated liposomes seemed most promising for future application; as Fospeg showed highest tumor fluorescence at the earlier time points. Lasers Surg. Med. 43 : 528 - 536, 2011.

40|$|Vital organ {{tissue in}} victims of strokes and {{heart attacks and}} {{patients}} undergoing cardiac and transplant surgeries present damage resulting from ischemia reperfusion injury {{in the form of}} impaired vascular function and tissue perfusion, and inflammatory conditions. Patient studied by diagnostic ultrasound have been found to present significantly attenuated indications of reperfusion injury, leading to the hypothesis that the use of ultrasound could be a therapeutic treatment for ischemia reperfusion injury. These studies were carried out to elucidate the biochemical mechanism underlying ultrasound irradiation's efficacy in the prevention of ischemia reperfusion injury with particular emphasis on the affects on nitric oxide (NO) production. Studies were carried out in the microcirculation using the methods of intravital microscopy and the dorsal skin <b>fold</b> <b>window</b> chamber hamster preparation. In vivo real-time analysis of the microcirculation was performed in the tissue of conscious animal subjects. The principal data assessed was functional capillary density and microvascular diameter, blood flow velocity and flow, in order to assess tissue injury and vessel function. We compare tissue injury with and without ultrasound irradiation as well as ultrasound irradiation during ischemia or reperfusion. We also compare the influence of NO synthase (NOS) inhibition on the effects of ultrasound irradiation of animals. We carried out molecular comparative analysis of irradiated and unexposed tissue by Western Blotting. The effects of ultrasound exposure on inflammatory conditions were determined by assessing venular leukocyte endothelial cell interaction with ultrasound irradiation. Improved microcirculatory function of all vessels following ultrasound irradiation was seen as a long-term effect (24 hours), supporting the hypothesis of injury moderation by diagnostic ultrasound stimulation. Arterioles showed increased flow; capillaries had enhanced perfusion and venules showed decreased leukocyte endothelial cell interaction. Molecular analysis and inhibition of endothelial and inducible NOS clarified the difference between stimulated NO production pathways in causing beneficial effects in the damaged microcirculation. The mechanism underlying the efficacy of ultrasound irradiation in the prevention of ischemia reperfusion injury is evidently mediated by NO productio...|$|R

The system of transport sources noise rationing in Russia doesn't consider the established practice of its application. The aircraft of noisy types were actively taken out of service and aviation noise impact near the airports decreased, but the problem of noise protection, de- mands control when planning land use. Noise measurements in residential areas, near houses and inside, showed the excess of maximum allowed level values to 25 - 35 dBA (on equivalent value) and to 25 - 40 dBA (on the maximum value). As a consequence of the European states policy {{in the sphere}} of aviation noise management and of aerodrome en- virons zoning noise levels at the airports of Europe and their surroundings were stabilized and the sizes of noise contours were reduced.
