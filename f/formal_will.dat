5|$|In English law, secret trusts are a {{class of}} trust defined as an {{arrangement}} between a testator and a trustee, made to come into force after death, that aims to benefit a person without having been written in a <b>formal</b> <b>will.</b> The property {{is given to the}} trustee in the will, and he would then be expected to pass it on to the real beneficiary. For these to be valid, the person seeking to enforce the trust must prove that the testator intended to form a trust, that this intention was communicated to the trustee, and that the trustee accepted his office. There are two types of secret trust — fully secret and half-secret. A fully secret trust is one with no mention in the will whatsoever. In the case of a half-secret trust, the face of the will names the trustee as trustee, but does not give the trust's terms, including the beneficiary. The most important difference lies in communication of the trust: the terms of a half-secret trust must be communicated to the trustee before the execution of the will, whereas {{in the case of a}} fully secret trust the terms may be communicated after the execution of the will, as long as this is before the testator's death.|$|E
60|$|But I, {{that was}} born to be my own destroyer, could no more resist the offer than I could {{restrain}} my first rambling designs when my father’ good counsel was lost upon me. In a word, I told them I would go with all my heart, if they would undertake to look after my plantation in my absence, and would dispose of it to such as I should direct, if I miscarried. This they all engaged to do, and entered into writings or covenants to do so; and I made a <b>formal</b> <b>will,</b> disposing of my plantation and effects in case of my death, making {{the captain of the}} ship that had saved my life, as before, my universal heir, but obliging him to dispose of my effects as I had directed in my will; one half of the produce being to himself, and the other to be shipped to England.|$|E
60|$|Wealth now accumulating on me, and {{uncommon}} success crowning my prosperous labours, I {{might have}} rested happy in that middle state of life {{my father had}} so often recommended, yet nothing would content me, such was my evil genius, but I must leave this happy station, for a foolish ambition in rising; and thus, once more, I cast myself into the greatest gulph of misery that ever poor creature fell into. Having lived four years in Brazil, I had net only learned the language, but contracted acquaintance with the most eminent planters, and even the merchants of St. Salvadore; to whom, once, by way of discourse, having given account of my two voyages to the coast of Guinea and the manner of trading there for mere trifles, by which we furnish our plantations with Negroes, they gave such attention to what I said, that three of them came one morning to me, and told me they had a secret proposal to make. After enjoining me to secrecy (it being an infringement on {{the powers of the}} Kings of Portugal and Spain) they told me they had a mind to fit out a ship to go to Guinea, in order to stock the plantation with Negroes, which as they could not be publicly sold, they would divide among them: and if I would go their supercargo in the ship, to manage the trading part, I should have ah equal share of the Negroes, without providing any stock. The thing indeed was fair enough, had I been in another condition. But I, born to be my own destroyer, could not resist the proposal, but accepted the offer upon condition of their looking after my plantation. So making a <b>formal</b> <b>will,</b> I bequeathed my effects to my good friend the captain, as my universal heir; but obliged him to dispose of my effects as directed, one half of the produce to himself, and the other to be shipped to England.|$|E

She also leaves her jewellery to Deirdre, claiming she knew Deirdre had her eye on it, an imitation silver music box to Amy and her late husband Donald's fobwatch to Simon. Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden) is also invited to the reading, but all Blanche has 'left' him is the chance {{to be the first to}} spread details of the will around the street - the only time he would get his hands on a piece of gossip before she did.|$|E

40|$|BDNPF/A is {{a useful}} {{energetic}} plasticizer, but mixed formal, which consists of BDNPF, DNPBF, and BDNBF, is anticipated {{to be better than}} BDNPF/A in chemically, thermally and economically. Last year, we successfully synthesized and characterized the mixed formal that has minimum contents of diformal. It is well known that the existing mixed formal always has an 8 ~ 10 % of diformal. At first, we attempted to reduce the diformal content. During this study, we have got the ability to control diformal content variably. In order to control the diformal content, synthetic procedure and reaction condition were modified and adjusted precisely. From this result, we used the diformal as a new eutectic agent and proposed the new component of mixed formal. The thermogravimetry (TG) analysis of the new mixed formal plasticizer shows an acceptable stability for practical applications. This new plasticizer is expected to be cheaper than the existing mixed formal because only one compound of starting material, DNP-OH, is required, DNB-OH will not be used for this process, and the yield of formalization reaction was increased from 75 % to more than 90 %. Furthermore, this plasticizer does not crystallize at- 20. Finally, we confirmed that the diformal is more effective than the existing eutectic material produced with DNB-OH. The synthesis, characteristics and application of the new two-component mixed <b>formal</b> <b>will</b> be discussed...|$|E

40|$|In Irresolute Testators, Professor Jane Baron provocatively {{suggests}} {{the existence of}} two distinct types of testators: the rational, autonomous testator who has made deliberate choices about the contents of her will and whose errors, if any, are minor; and the more vulnerable, less resolute testator {{who may not have}} actually made the final decisions enshrined in a <b>formal</b> <b>will.</b> To illustrate how these testators appear in wills law, she analyzes how courts apply the doctrines of harmless error and mistake reformation. While the two doctrines appear to be intended to help the resolute testator, courts instead, she suggests, also apply the doctrines to help the irresolute testator. In causing us to reflect on the distinctions between dispository intent and a formal writing recognizable as a final statement, on rational and boundedly rational testators, on final and almost-final declarations, her article focuses us on the art of line-drawing in wills law. In this commentary, I explore another context that similarly raises issues about testators whose final intent is not clearly expressed: when can a disappointed beneficiary sue the drafting attorney for malpractice? The doctrine of privity confronts the spectre of the irresolute or inconclusive testator, yet courts have developed some dividing lines that differ from those they have developed surrounding harmless error. Privity seems to offer another illustration of how bright-line rules do not necessarily achieve dispository intent, although the privity rules do achieve certainty on only allowing final dispository statements (that are incomplete or show a lack of resolution) to provide a basis for a malpractice action. This commentary applauds Professor Baron’s achievement in focusing us on the limits of the wills reform doctrines and the significance of accounting for different types of testators...|$|E
