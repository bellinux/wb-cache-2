50|$|The castle {{is said to}} {{be subject}} to strong paranormal {{phenomena}} and haunted by the ghosts of Patti; her second husband, French tenor Nicolini; and the object of her affection, the composer Rossini. Unexplained presences taking many different forms have allegedly been experienced by visitors all over the castle. Nurses who worked at Craig-y-nos while it was a hospital have reported many presences and frequent reports of having walked past somebody on the stairs or corridor but nobody being there, as well as many unexplained noises and sounds of footsteps. Visitors have also reported experiencing breathing difficulties and of feeling a lingering presence of patients who were hospitalized there while suffering from tuberculosis. On one occasion a film crew were recording an interview in the theatre, and while in the kitchen they were discussing the fact that Adelina Patti had never mastered the role of Carmen. Suddenly a <b>heavy</b> <b>saucepan,</b> resting on a large cooker, placed far enough away from the edge not to fall, flew onto the floor.|$|E
50|$|A common {{recipe is}} equal parts (typically 0.3 litres) of heavy cream (not whipped), sugar and golden syrup. It is also common {{to add a}} few tablespoons of butter. One may also add one or two teaspoons of vanilla sugar or about 0.1 kg of peeled and finely chopped almonds. Put all the {{ingredients}} except for the almonds in a <b>heavy</b> based <b>saucepan</b> and stir until the sugar has melted. Simmer until {{a few drops of}} the mix poured into cold water can be rolled into a chewy or hard ball. Then add the almonds and pour the mixture in waxed paper cups and leave to cool. Even though the recipe is easy, the process of simmering can take up to 1.5 hours.|$|R
