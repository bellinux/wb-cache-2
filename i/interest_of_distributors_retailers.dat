Due to China's large territory, large population, varying degrees of economic development, and widely different local regulations, Lenovo was having difficulty operating nationwide. While Lenovo had been using direct sales and a network <b>of</b> <b>distributors,</b> Yang gave up on direct sales in favor of exclusively using independent agents to avoid the costs of administering a complex sales network. This action resulted in Lenovo cutting its sales staff from over 100 to just 18 in 1994. To gain confidence among distributors, Lenovo provided {{a wide range of}} products, offered reasonable prices, and closely supervised the marketing of its products to look out for the <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>distributors.</b> In contrast to Lenovo, foreign firms often tried to squeeze distributors' margins.

40|$|Since 1998, sales {{channels}} for investment trusts have expanded in Japan. We expected this {{to result in}} greater demand for investment trusts but these expectations {{have yet to be}} met. The underlying causes of investment trusts' slow growth may be due to negative net returns to individual investors during the economic downturn - i. e., after deducting costs from dividends. When the Japanese economy is sluggish, asset management companies should invest in high-growth Asia, among other regions, rather than the domestic market. And when domestic financial markets are strong, the companies should invest more in Japanese markets. Investment trusts are the vehicle for seizing world economic trends. However, the performance of Japan's investment trusts has not been as good as that of the United States (US). To further enhance demand for investment trusts, their fee structure must be changed so that asset management companies, distributors, and individual investors seek the same goals. In other words, the <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>distributors</b> and asset management companies would need to be better aligned...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{focus on}} the data models for storing the data {{generated}} by radio frequency identification (RFID) transactions and architectures for processing such data. We consider the supply chain comprised <b>of</b> the manufacturer, <b>distributor,</b> <b>retailer,</b> and the consumer. We discuss details of the data generated by RFID transactions and data models to store such data. Different organizations in the supply chain may use this data for different applications such as automatic product ordering, shelf replenish-ment, and product recall. We present models to anticipate the data requirements generated by RFID transactions and indicate how existing enterprise applications {{can be adapted to}} handle RFID data. The results presented in this paper will help a practitioner to 1) design and develop databases and applications for handling RFID data and 2) significantly reduce the storage requirements of RFID data. Using the data architectures, we discuss two supply chain applications—product recall and shelf replenishment—in detail. We present analytical models for the cost and time required for shelf replenishment in a retail store.

40|$|The {{market for}} organic food {{has been growing}} 20 % per {{year for the past}} nine years. Fruits and {{vegetables}} are {{a large part of the}} organic market, accounting for more than $ 670 million in retail sales annually. This presents an opportunity for entry of new agricultural producers, and the expansion of existing organic growers. Similarly to other businesses, organic producers will succeed by providing customer value. The best opportunity for organic growers to achieve this is to focus on increasing the perceived benefits of the product. Examples of benefits for organic growers to focus on are: favorable environmental impacts, positive health benefits, and positive effects on the local economy. Since the market for organic fruits and vegetables is currently small relative to the overall food market, a market segmentation strategy is advisable. Two market segments, the "True Naturals" and the "New Green Mainstream" have been identified as the core market for natural products. Marketing efforts should be focused on appealing to one (or both) of these groups. Six major marketing channels were considered, with positive aspects and barriers/potential pitfalls given for each. The two easiest channels to enter, in terms of lowest financial capital and networking requirements, are farm markets (on-site) and farmers' markets. These alternatives may have limited volume potential, however. The upside <b>of</b> marketing to <b>distributors,</b> <b>retailers,</b> and restaurants is the potential to market a substantially larger volume than would be possible through marketing direct to consumers. Significant barriers must be overcome to market to these more complex buyers, however. The best way to enter these channels (i. e., <b>distributors,</b> <b>retailers,</b> and restaurants) is for growers to pool resources and work together as a group. Demand and Price Analysis,...|$|R
