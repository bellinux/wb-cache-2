40|$|The European {{emissions}} legislation requires {{to check}} the conformity of heavy-duty engines with the applicable emissions certification standards during the normal life of those engines: these are the “In Service Conformity” (ISC) requirements. It was considered impractical and expensive to adopt an <b>in-service</b> <b>conformity</b> (ISC) checking scheme for heavy-duty vehicles, which require removal of engines from vehicles to test pollutant emissions against legislative limits. Therefore, it has been proposed to develop a protocol for <b>in-service</b> <b>conformity</b> checking of heavy-duty vehicles based {{on the use of}} Portable Emission Measurement Systems (PEMS). The European Commission through DG ENTR in co-operation with DG JRC launched in January 2004 a co-operative research programme to study the feasibility of PEMS in view of their application in Europe for <b>In-Service</b> <b>Conformity</b> of heavy-duty engines. The technical and experimental activities were started in August 2004 to study the feasibility of PEMS systems and to study their potential application for on-road measurements on heavy-duty vehicles. The main objectives of the above project had been defined as follows: -To assess and validate the application and performance of portable instrumentation relative to each other, and in comparison with alternative options for ISC testing; -To define a test protocol for the use of portable instrumentation within the ISC of heavy-duty vehicles; -To assess on-road data evaluation methods such as the US ‘Not To Exceed’ (NTE) approach and possibly to develop a simplified ones; -To address the need of the European industry, authorities and test houses to go through a learning process with on-vehicle emissions testing. The main objective of the present document is to report on: a. The evaluation of the test protocol, i. e. to judge whether the mandatory data and its quality were appropriate for the final evaluation (S b. The analysis conducted to evaluate the potential of the different data evaluation (Pass/Fail) methods for ISC and in particular their ability to use on-road PEMS emissions data. The candidate methods were categorized into two families: -The "control-area / data reduction methods" (Chapter 4) that use only a part of the data, depending whether the operation points considered are part of a control area and belong to a sequence of consecutive points within this control area. The US-NTE (Not To Exceed) method - already established as an official tool in the United States - falls into this category but variations of the methods could be envisaged (with another control area for instance). -The "averaging window methods" (Chapter 4. 3) that use all the operation data. The main objective of task b. was to answer the following question: “Once the data has been collected correctly, what is the most appropriate method to analyze the test data measured with PEMS and to judge whether the engine is in conformity with the applicable emissions limits?”JRC.

40|$|This {{guidance}} document is a JRC technical support document, {{contributing to the}} development of best practices with PEMS. It shall be used primarily for the preparation, the execution and the follow-up of the emissions tests with PEMS on road heavy-duty vehicles (HDV) equipped with conventional combustion engines (gasoline, diesel, CNG, LPG). The document does not substitute either the operation manuals of the instruments or safety rules and recommendations nor official regulatory texts regarding in-use emissions tests with PEMS. The intention of this guide is to clarify some operational points of the PEMS procedure and to provide a guide for the application of PEMS inside and outside the regulatory context (<b>In-Service</b> <b>Conformity</b> Testing of heavy-duty engines as foreseen in Regulations 582 / 2011 and 64 / 2012).

40|$|Light-duty diesel {{vehicles}} emit on {{the road}} substantially more nitrogen oxides than permitted by regulatory emissions standards. The European Commission addresses this problem by developing a complementary emissions test procedure for the type approval and <b>in-service</b> <b>conformity</b> testing of these vehicles. To facilitate the technical development, the European Commission established in January 2011 the Real-Driving Emissions - Light-Duty Vehicles (RDE-LDV) working group that {{is open to all}} stakeholders. This report presents the results of the technical assessment that was carried out by the RDE-LDV working group for two candidate procedures: (i) emissions testing with random driving cycles in the laboratory and (ii) on-road emissions testing with Portable Emissions Measurement Systems (PEMS). Both procedures are technically feasible. However, PEMS on-road testing appears to be more effective than random-cycle testing in limiting the pollutant emissions of light-duty vehicles because it (i) allows a wider range of driving conditions to be covered and (ii) might more effectively prevent the detection of emissions tests and the use of defeat strategies. Nonetheless, PEMS on-road testing faces practical challenges, including open safety issues, the currently limited availability of PEMS equipment, and potential climatic, geographical, and seasonal constraints for the execution of emissions tests. Random-cycle testing presents advantages over PEMS on-road testing in that already established laboratory equipment and know-how to be used. The present assessment is subject to uncertainty because the implementation and running costs as well as the overall effectiveness of the two candidate procedures depend on the definition of concrete boundary conditions (e. g., permitted test temperatures, severity of driving patterns). These definitions are not yet agreed. Accounting for the resulting uncertainty, it has been decided that the JRC will develop a PEMS-based test procedure. Vehicle manufacturers are given the opportunity to develop a random cycle-based test procedure. A decision will be made regarding the implementation for type approval and <b>in-service</b> <b>conformity</b> testing based on a comparison of the two fully developed test procedures by the end of 2013.

40|$|Since the EURO V {{standards}} for heavy-duty engines, the European emissions legislation requires {{to verify the}} conformity of heavy-duty engines with the applicable emissions certification standards: these provisions are identified as “In Service Conformity” (ISC). It was considered impractical and expensive to adopt an ISC scheme for heavy-duty vehicles requiring the removal of engines from vehicles to test pollutant emissions against legislative limits. Therefore, it was proposed to develop a protocol for <b>in-service</b> <b>conformity</b> checking of heavy-duty vehicles based {{on the use of}} Portable Emission Measurement Systems (PEMS). As a result, ISC testing based on PEMS was introduced in the EURO V and the EURO VI standards. The corresponding administrative and technical provisions were formulated in the European Regulations 582 / 2011 and 64 / 2012. The above route was followed for non-road engines as well: preliminary research activities studied and confirmed the possibility to apply the methods developed for heavy-duty engines with minor modifications. The basis for the introduction of ISC provisions based on the PEMS approach into the European NRMM type-approval legislation has been established in several texts. The NRMM PEMS Pilot Program was launched to facilitate the introduction into the European NRMM emissions legislation of use of PEMS as a tool for ISC. This had to be achieved by improving the technical procedures (e. g. available from the heavy-duty scheme) and increasing the awareness of the different stakeholders about PEMS as a new regulatory tool.

40|$|Euro VI {{emission}} standards for heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) introduced {{for the first}} time limits for solid particle number (PN) and NH 3 emissions. EU regulation also includes a Portable Emissions Measurement System (PEMS) based test at type approval, followed by <b>in-service</b> <b>conformity</b> (ISC) testing. A comprehensive study on the real-time on-road emissions of NOx, NH 3, N 2 O and PN from a Euro VI HDV equipped with a Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC), a Diesel Particle Filter (DPF), a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system and an Ammonia Oxidation Catalyst (AMOX) is presented. Our analyses revealed that up to 85 % of the NOx emissions measured during the tests performed are not taken into consideration if the boundary conditions for data exclusion set in the current legislation are applied. Moreover, {{it was found that the}} highest NOx emissions were measured during urban operation. Analyses show that a large fraction urban of operation is not considered when 20 % power threshold as boundary condition is applied. They also show that cold start emissions account for a large fraction of the total NOx emitted. Low emissions of PN (2. 8 × 1010 to 6. 5 × 1010 #/kWh) and NH 3 (1. 0 to 2. 2 ppm) were obtained during the on-road tests, suggesting effectiveness of the vehicle's after-treatment (DPF and AMOX). Finally, a comparison between speed-based (as currently defined by Euro VI legislation) and land-use-based (using Geographic Information System (GIS)) calculation of shares of operation was performed. Results suggest that using GIS to categorize the shares of operation could result in different interpretations depending on the criteria adopted for their definition. JRC.

40|$|Heavy-duty {{diesel engines}} {{are used in}} {{different}} application areas, like long-haul, city distribution, dump truck and building and construction industry. For these wide variety of areas, the engine performance needs {{to comply with the}} real-world legislation limits and should simultaneously have a low fuel consumption and good drivability. Meeting these requirements takes substantial development and calibration effort, where an optimal fuel consumption for each application is not always met in practice. TNO's Integrated Emission Management (IEM) strategy, is able to deal with these variations in operating conditions, while meeting legislation limits and obtaining on-line cost optimization. Based on the actual state of the engine and aftertreatment, optimal air-path setpoints are computed, which balances EGR and SCR usage. Due to IEM's adaptation characteristics based on the actual state of engine and aftertreatment system, the strategy is robust for varying conditions during real-world operation. This is especially of interest, since real-world emissions become increasingly important: in-use compliance, including Not-To-Exceed (NTE) areas, challenging On-Board-Diagnostics requirements and In-Use Performance Ratio (IUPR) monitoring. The main contribution of this work is to demonstrate the robustness of IEM on a variety of real-world cycles by means of a simulation study. Whereas previous publications focus on demonstration of the IEM strategy on Type Approval cycles, this work can be seen as an extension, which also addresses <b>In-Service</b> <b>Conformity</b> (ISC). This paper discusses in detail the performance and robustness of the IEM strategy at these cycles compared with a state-of-the-art Euro-VI engine control strategy (baseline). Consequent improvements are obtained among the different cycles. Fuel consumption and fluid cost are reduced up to 2 % and 1. 7 %, respectively, compared to this baseline strategy...|$|E
40|$|Heavy-duty {{diesel engines}} {{are used in}} a wide range of applications. For varying {{operating}} environments, the engine and aftertreatment system must comply with the real-world emission legislation limits. Simultaneously, minimal fuel consumption and good drivability are crucial for economic competitiveness and usability. Meeting these requirements takes substantial development and calibration effort, and complying with regulations results in a trade-off between emissions and fuel consumption. TNO's Integrated Emission Management (IEM) strategy finds online, the cost-optimal point in this trade-off and is able to deal with variations in operating conditions, while complying with legislation limits. Based on the actual state of the engine and aftertreatment system, an optimal engine operating point is computed using a model-based optimal-control algorithm. A novel feature introduced in this work is the addition of a feedback scheme to control the tailpipe NOx emissions through modification of the Lagrange multiplier in the optimal control algorithm. The Lagrange multiplier represents the penalty on tailpipe NOx emissions in the optimal control problem. This feature provides <b>In-Service</b> <b>Conformity</b> (ISC) in real-life operation and adds robustness, in terms of emissions, to system disturbances, such as production tolerances, system ageing and sensor or actuator errors. The IEM strategy is a generic toolkit and can incorporate additional optimization variables, provided their effects are accurately represented by the online models of the engine and aftertreatment system. This can be used to include additional degrees of freedom such as fuel injection timing, pressure, pre- and post-injections and power-splits for hybrid drivelines. IEM is capable of real-time implementation and has previously been operated on an engine testbed, showing up to 2 % reduction in fuel consumption that can be translated into a corresponding CO 2 emission reduction...|$|E
40|$|Variations {{are always}} present in {{processes}} {{and depending on}} how organisations manage these variations, targets risk not to be reached. The performance of a modern company strictly depends {{on the ability of}} combining interfaces between different processes, increasing the value added to the customer and optimizing utilization of the assets and resources; reducing the variation affecting the process. Variation Mode and Effect Analysis (VMEA) is a commonly known tool within product development for robust product design. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate if VMEA is applicable to processes in order to manage process variation and to build robust processes. The goal is to fulfil the purpose and to make generalizable conclusions. This work rises after a successful Six Sigma project, where the authors applied the VMEA methodology to a process in an improvement project. With the intention to achieve the purpose, a qualitative research strategy was selected. Qualitative data were collected through semi-structured interviews and a Kano survey. The main research was done at Volvo Group Trucks Technology (Volvo GTT). Furthermore, for increasing the validity of the study, a benchmark was performed at Volvo Group Trucks Operations, Ericsson AB and Tetra Pak. In addition, VMEA researchers and experiences Six Sigma black belts supervised this thesis work. A case study was performed at Powertrain Engineering within Volvo GTT for analysing the <b>In-Service</b> <b>Conformity</b> test process. The results of this thesis show that VMEA is applicable to processes. A new developed Process-VMEA (P-VMEA) framework is provided for identifying, assessing, mitigating and managing variations in a process. The deliveries of the framework are mainly directed towards decision makers and aim to strengthen fact based decisions. The reader is guided step by step in the P-VMEA methodology by using artificial organisation examples and real application cases. The P-VMEA framework is divided in four phases with review gates in the end of each phase to ensure that the goals are achieved...|$|E
