25|$|With India gaining independence, the American {{diplomatic}} post in Madras was officially raised to a Consulate General on 15 August 1947, marking {{a milestone in}} the bilateral {{relationship between the two}} countries. On the same day, Roy E. B. Bower became the last consul and the first consul general in Madras in independent India. With Parry's Company wanting the whole building in 1952, the Consulate had to look for new premises. Five years later, in the 1950s, the Consulate General moved to a building on Mount Road (the present day Anna Salai), currently occupied by the Bank of America. With the expansion of the Indo-U.S. relations after Independence, the Consulate General required a purpose-built structure to accommodate a diversity of activities such as library services, cultural programming, <b>educational</b> <b>exchange,</b> visas, American citizen services and development assistance, along with the ancient standby, trade promotion. For this purpose, the Consulate General leased out a parcel of land on the Gemini Circle from the Church of South India to build its own building. On 3 January 1969, the Consulate General moved to its present location on the Gemini Circle, which was inaugurated by Ambassador Chester Bowles.|$|E

[...] The judiciary was increasingly seen as a tool of the elite, having flagged the government for even the tiniest infractions while refusing to rein in the growing violence of the PAD.|$|E

The U.S. also funds <b>educational</b> <b>exchanges</b> with Vietnam, principallythe Vietnam Fulbright program, which receives more funding (typically $4 million annually) than any other Fulbright program in the world. These programs are not included in Table 1 because they are not funded through the foreign policy budget and confer benefits to both the U.S. and Vietnam. Additionally, the United States administers the Vietnam Education Foundation, which was established by Congress in 2000 to provide $5 million annually for scholarships and <b>educational</b> <b>exchanges.</b> Funds for the foundation are recycled from the Vietnamese government's repayments of the wartime debts South Vietnam owed the United States.
