Many of the prints do not have individual titles, and dozens of photographs are known by the same generic name Equivalent.

25|$|In 1922, Miró {{explored}} abstracted, strongly coloured surrealism in {{at least}} one painting. From the summer of 1923 in Mont-roig, Miró began a <b>key</b> <b>set</b> of paintings where abstracted pictorial signs, rather than the realistic representations used in The Farm, are predominant. In The Tilled Field, Catalan Landscape (The Hunter) and Pastoral (1923–24), these flat shapes and lines (mostly black or strongly coloured) suggest the subjects, sometimes quite cryptically. For Catalan Landscape (The Hunter), Miró represents the hunter with a combination of signs: a triangle for the head, curved lines for the moustache, angular lines for the body. So encoded is this work that at a later time Miró provided a precise explanation of the signs used.|$|E

40|$|Searchable {{encryption}} is used {{to support}} searches over encrypted data stored on cloud servers.

He noted that Fahy's subordinates had actually alerted Fahy in writing that failing to investigate that report, {{or at least}} to disclose its existence in the briefs or argument in the Supreme Court, [...] "might approximate the suppression of evidence." [...] Thus, Katyal concluded that Mr. Fahy [...] "did not inform the Court that a <b>key</b> <b>set</b> of allegations used to justify the internment" [...] had been doubted, if not fully discredited, within the government's own agencies.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the security of}} authenticated encryption schemes in the public <b>key</b> <b>setting.</b> We present two new notions of authenticity that are stronger than the integrity notions given in the symmetric setting [5]. We also show that chosen-ciphertext attack security (IND-CCA) in the public <b>key</b> <b>setting</b> is not obtained in general from the combination of chosen-plaintext security (IND-CPA) and integrity of ciphertext (INT-CTXT), which {{is in contrast to}} the results shown in the symmetric setting [13, 5]. We provide security analyses of authenticated encryption schemes constructed by combining a given public key encryption scheme and a given digital signature scheme in a " manner |namely, Encrypt-and-Sign, Sign-then-Encrypt, and Encrypt-then-Sign| and show that none of them, in general, provide security under all notions dened in this paper. We then present a scheme called ESSR that meets all security notions dened here. We also give security analyses on an ecient Die-Hellman based scheme called DHETM, which {{can be thought of as}} a transform of the encryption scheme " [1] into an authenticated encryption scheme in the public <b>key</b> <b>setting.</b> Keywords: Public <b>key</b> <b>setting,</b> Authenticated encryption, Privacy, Authenticity, Unforgeability.

2500|$|Stieglitz {{produced}} more than 2,500 mounted photographs over his career. After his death, O’Keeffe assembled a set of what she considered {{the best of his}} photographs that he had personally mounted. In some cases she included slightly different versions of the same image, and these series are invaluable for their insights about Stieglitz's aesthetic composition. In 1949, she donated the first part of what she called the [...] "key set" [...] of 1,317 Stieglitz photographs to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC. In 1980, she added to the set another 325 photographs taken by Stieglitz of her, including many nudes. Now numbering 1,642 photographs, it is the largest, most complete collection of Stieglitz's work anywhere in the world. In 2002 the National Gallery published a two-volume, 1,012-page catalog that reproduced the complete <b>key</b> <b>set</b> along with detailed annotations about each photograph.|$|E
