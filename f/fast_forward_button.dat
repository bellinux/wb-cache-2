Some critics however expressed concerns over the presence of some repetitive aspects of gameplay—noted as being especially apparent when attempting multiple playthroughs—as well as the accessibility of the game's Bad Boys Love scenario to casual players: in his review of the remake for PC Gamer, Julian Murdoch states that [...] "I suspect few will have the patience to ride the <b>fast</b> <b>forward</b> <b>button</b> and suss out the romantic proclivities of each cast member to get to the extended ending—really a second half—of the game".|$|E

50|$|The release rate buttons, i.e. to {{increase}} or decrease rate of lemmings; instant replay mode; and <b>fast</b> <b>forward</b> <b>button</b> all return from previous games. Levels are once again divided into four difficulty settings: Fun, Tricky, Taxing and Mayhem. There are 20 levels of each setting, with 20 more practice levels to learn about different game elements. Each level has a set amount of lemmings again, and can be returned to {{through the use of}} passwords.|$|E
50|$|The player will {{be rewarded}} with a bronze, silver or gold medal, {{depending}} on how many lemmings are saved in the level. This will also dictate the type of the talisman part received once all the tribe's levels are completed. To watch the outro and credits, all golden talisman parts need to be won by rescuing enough lemmings from each tribe. A new <b>fast</b> <b>forward</b> <b>button</b> and fan button {{have been added to}} the controls. The fast forward replaces the release rate button in the original game, which would let the player release more lemmings at a time. The fan button turns the cursor into a fan, which is used to push around any flying lemmings or to affect wind-powered elements.|$|E

5000|$|Learner control principle: [...] Deeper {{learning}} {{occurs when}} learners {{can control the}} rate at which they move forward through segmented content. Learners tend to do best when the narration stops after a short, meaningful segment of content is given and the learner has to click a [...] "continue" [...] button in order to start the next segment. Some research suggests not overwhelming the learner with too many control options, however. Giving just pause and play buttons may work better than giving pause, play, <b>fast</b> <b>forward,</b> reverse <b>buttons.</b> Also, high prior-knowledge learners may learn better when the lesson moves forward automatically, but they have a pause button that allows them to stop when they choose to do so.|$|R

5000|$|Back in {{the real}} world, Vicky is {{watching}} Timmy, Cosmo, and Wanda fool around in the TV (she doesn't know it's them yet) and considers the programming to be boring. She fools with the remote she took from Timmy, it's magical properties cause it to merge a political debate show (a parody of Politically Incorrect) with a wrestling theme (a parody of WWE), much to Vicky's entertainment. She realizes that the remote can do magical things, and changes the channel to a contest show (a parody of Wheel of Fortune). A man is about to win 1,000,000 and he says he'll give it all to charity, Vicky is disgusted by this and screams [...] "Why can't that be ME!?" [...] and pounds on the remote in frustration. The remote zaps her into the TV contest and she is handed a bag of money, but the host takes it back when its pointed out that Vicky is 16, not 18 because she is too young {{to participate in the}} TV contest. Frustrated, Vicky smacks the remote again, pressing the <b>fast</b> <b>forward</b> <b>button</b> and aging her to 18. Vicky is now able to take the contest money, and she also begins to realize the power of the remote. She wants to go to the Dictator Week program on TV so that she can take over the world, which makes the host think she's really happy and on fire.|$|E
40|$|Computer {{simulation}} {{attempts to}} 2 ̆ 2 mimic 2 ̆ 2 real-life or hypothetical behavior {{on a computer}} to see how processes or systems can be improved and to predict their performance under different circumstances. Simulation has been successfully applied in many disciplines and {{is considered to be}} a relevant and highly applicable tool in Business Process Management (BPM). Unfortunately, in reality the use of simulation is limited. Few organizations actively use simulation. Even organizations that purchase simulation software (stand-alone or embedded in some BPM suite), typically fail to use it continuously over an extended period. This keynote paper highlights some of the problems causing the limited adoption of simulation. For example, simulation models tend to oversimplify the modeling of people working part-time on a process. Also simulation studies typically focus on the steady-state behavior of business processes while managers are more interested in short-term results (a 2 ̆ 2 <b>fast</b> <b>forward</b> <b>button</b> 2 ̆ 2 into the future) for operational decision making. This paper will point out innovative simulation approaches leveraging on recent breakthroughs in process mining...|$|E
25|$|<b>Fast</b> <b>Forwards</b> were {{initially}} offered on every {{leg of the}} Race, excluding the final leg. To reduce costs of production involved with untaken <b>Fast</b> <b>Forward</b> tasks, the number of <b>Fast</b> <b>Forwards</b> available was reduced to two on each Race starting in season five, and then down to one as of season 14. <b>Fast</b> <b>Forwards</b> sometimes are not shown if no team opts to take the <b>Fast</b> <b>Forward</b> or if all remaining teams have used their <b>Fast</b> <b>Forward.</b> As a result, some later seasons have not featured any <b>Fast</b> <b>Forward</b> but it is unknown whether there was one offered or not.|$|R

25|$|A <b>Fast</b> <b>Forward</b> {{is a task}} that, once completed, {{allows the}} team that completes it to bypass all {{remaining}} tasks in the leg and proceed directly to the Pit Stop. The <b>Fast</b> <b>Forward</b> clue is given with another task clue (usually a Roadblock or Detour) and is a separate task from the others. Only one team may complete a <b>Fast</b> <b>Forward</b> in any given leg, and a team may only complete one <b>Fast</b> <b>Forward</b> in the entire Race. The exception to this rule is in seasons wherein the <b>Fast</b> <b>Forward</b> is offered {{in conjunction with the}} Intersection, in which case a team may win the <b>Fast</b> <b>Forward</b> both as an individual team and as a team working with another as part of the Intersection instructions. Teams that win the <b>Fast</b> <b>Forward</b> are not guaranteed a first-place finish for that leg and still face elimination if they arrive at the Pit Stop last. Multiple teams may undertake <b>Fast</b> <b>Forward</b> tasks, but only the first team to complete the task gets credit. If a team fails to get the <b>Fast</b> <b>Forward</b> (either by quitting the task or being beaten to it), they must return and complete the leg as normal. This creates a risk in going for the <b>Fast</b> <b>Forward</b> and potentially losing time with the other teams for that leg.|$|R
