40|$|This {{research}} is aimed {{to examine the}} influences of Islamic identity and Islamic Fundamentalism on the tolerance <b>for</b> <b>Christians,</b> either directly or indirectly, mediated by the Islamic ethnocentrism in Indonesia. Such influences are constructed in the theoretical model of tolerance <b>for</b> <b>Christians.</b> In order to examine the model, {{data were collected from}} a sample consisting of 387 undergraduate Muslim students in the fourth semester in state higher education in Semarang, Indonesia by applying stratified cluster random sampling. The data collection used the Scale of Tolerance <b>for</b> <b>Christians,</b> Scale of Islamic Ethnocentrism, Scale of Islamic Identity, and Scale of Islamic Fundamentalism. The obtained data were then analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling. The results of the analysis indicated that: 1) The theoretical model of the influence of Islamic identity and Islamic fundamentalism on the tolerance <b>for</b> <b>Christians,</b> either directly or indirectly, mediated by Islamic ethnocentrism is valid or supported by the empirical data. 2). Variables of Islamic identity and Islamic fundamentalism have influences upon Islamic ethnocentrism. 3).

5|$|Alongside his {{stand-alone}} illustrations, in July 1926 Hergé began {{production of}} a comic strip for Le Boy-Scout Belge, Les Aventures de Totor (The Adventures of Totor), which continued intermittent publication until 1929.

Illustrations were also published in Le Blé qui lève (The Wheat That Grows) and other publications of the Catholic Association of Belgian Young People, and Hergé produced a book jacket for Weverbergh's novel, The Soul of the Sea. Being young and inexperienced, still learning his craft, Hergé sought guidance from an older cartoonist, Pierre Ickx, and together they founded the short-lived Atelier de la Fleur de Lys (AFL), an organisation <b>for</b> <b>Christian</b> cartoonists.|$|E
