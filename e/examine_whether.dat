5|$|In {{response}} to {{the threat posed by}} France during the Napoleonic Wars, Lieutenant Colonel John Brown surveyed the castle in 1804 to <b>examine</b> <b>whether</b> the central keep could be turned into a Martello tower, a type of circular gun tower popular during this period. The scheme was not taken forward, although the defences of the surrounding coast line were much improved by the government. The painter J. M. W. Turner visited between 1805 and 1807 during the middle of this work, later depicting the castle in landscape paintings and sketches of the area.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), the Court of Appeal {{expanded}} the scope of judicial review by adopting an objective test when reviewing the exercise of executive discretion. In contrast to the subjective test, the objective test permits the court to <b>examine</b> <b>whether</b> the decision-maker's satisfaction was based on objective facts which fell {{within the scope of}} the purposes specified by the ISA. The subjective satisfaction or mere ipse dixit of the executive body is insufficient. However, the adoption of this objective test was only part of the obiter dicta of the case. The ratio decidendi of the case was based on narrower technical grounds.|$|E

5|$|The Court {{held that}} the {{exercises}} of discretion by the President and the Minister under sections 8 and 10 of the ISA are reviewable by the courts because the subjective test that had been adopted in the 1969 Malaysian case Karam Singh v. Menteri Hal Ehwal Dalam Negeri (Minister of Home Affairs), Malaysia, which had been adopted locally in 1971 in Lee Mau Seng v. Minister for Home Affairs, {{could no longer be}} supported and should be replaced by an objective test. Furthermore, although a court would not question the executive's decision as to what national security required, the court could <b>examine</b> <b>whether</b> the executive's decision was indeed based on national security considerations.|$|E
5|$|The United Fruit Company {{was badly}} {{affected}} by the reforms of Jacobo Árbenz, especially Decree 900, the agrarian reform law. It responded with an intensive lobbying campaign directed at members of the United States government. The Cold War had also predisposed the Truman administration to see the Guatemalan government as communist. The CIA started to explore the notion of lending support to detractors and opponents of Árbenz. Walter Bedell Smith, the Director of Central Intelligence, ordered J. C. King, {{the chief of the}} Western Hemisphere Division, to <b>examine</b> <b>whether</b> dissident Guatemalans could topple the Árbenz government if they had support from the authoritarian governments in Central America.|$|E
5|$|Thom {{wished to}} <b>examine</b> <b>whether</b> or not prehistoric peoples used high-accuracy astronomy. He {{believed}} that by using horizon astronomy, observers could make estimates of dates {{in the year}} to a specific day. The observation required finding a place where on a specific date the sun set into a notch on the horizon. A common theme is a mountain which blocked the Sun, but on the right day would allow the tiniest fraction to re-emerge {{on the other side}} for a 'double sunset'. The animation below shows two sunsets at a hypothetical site, one the day before the summer solstice and one at the summer solstice, which has a double sunset.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{evidence in}} New Zealand about whether auditors providing more non-audit services are less independent. Three sets of tests {{are used to}} address the issue. The first <b>examines</b> <b>whether</b> there is a relation between non-audit fees and audit fees, the second <b>examines</b> <b>whether</b> there is a relation between non-audit fees and audit report qualification or modification, and the third <b>examines</b> <b>whether</b> there is a relation between non-audit fees and stability of audit tenure. The results suggest a potential for the impairment of auditor independence in appearance when auditors provide non-audit services but {{no evidence of any}} impact on independence of mind.

40|$|Though {{significant}} {{research has}} found that sentencing guidelines systems have reduced sentencing disparity, few studies have <b>examined</b> <b>whether</b> sentencing guidelines have shifted discretion and disparity from judges to prosecutors. Using data from the District of Columbia Superior Court, this research <b>examines</b> <b>whether</b> charge bargaining practices changed after the District of Columbia Sentencing Guidelines. This study also <b>examines</b> <b>whether</b> legal, offender, and case processing characteristics had different effects on charge bargaining outcomes before and after the Sentencing Guidelines. The analyses show that, while there were changes in the plea bargaining process after the Sentencing Guidelines, there was not significant evidence of a displacement of discretion or disparity to prosecutors.

ABC News later clarified that the special counsel is gathering preliminary information about possible obstruction of justice, but a full-scale investigation {{has not yet been}} launched.|$|E
