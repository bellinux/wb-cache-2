The equilibrium is obtained by using the Mixed Complementarity Problem approach. In addition, the proposed model is applied to a three-bus system, which verifies the feasibility of this model...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} Turkey's net electricity energy <b>generation</b> <b>and</b> demand {{based on}} economic indicators. Forecasting model for electricity energy <b>generation</b> <b>and</b> demand is first {{proposed by the}} ant colony optimization (ACO) approach.

Ant colony optimization electricity energy estimation (ACOEEE) model is developed using population, gross domestic product (GDP), import and export. All equations proposed here are linear electricity energy <b>generation</b> <b>and</b> demand (linear_ACOEEGE and linear ACOEEDE) <b>and</b> quadratic energy <b>generation</b> <b>and</b> demand (quadratic_ACOEEGE and quadratic ACOEEDE). Quadratic models for both <b>generation</b> <b>and</b> demand provided better fit solution due to the fluctuations of the economic indicators.

5|$|Like most brown algae, Postelsia {{goes through}} {{alternation}} of <b>generations,</b> <b>and</b> is an annual species. The diploid sporophyte produces, through meiosis, haploid spores, which drip {{down through the}} grooves in the blades onto the substrate, which may be mussels, barnacles, or bare rock. These spores develop, through mitosis, into small, multicellular haploid gametophytes, male and female. The male and female gametophytes create sperm and eggs, respectively. The sperm of the male reaches the female egg and fertilizes, resulting in a diploid zygote, which develops into a new sporophyte.|$|E

5|$|Since 1998, the mallard {{has been}} rated {{as a species}} of least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species.

5|$|The central {{concept of}} natural {{selection}} is the evolutionary fitness of an organism.

For example, if an organism could survive well and reproduce rapidly, but its offspring were all too small and weak to survive, this organism would make little genetic contribution to future <b>generations</b> <b>and</b> would thus have low fitness.|$|E
