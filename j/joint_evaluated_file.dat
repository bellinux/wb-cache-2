A table and a large number of figures are given with experimental and calculated capture reactivity worths in the five STEK cores for most of these nuclides. A correction for scattering was made based upon the original evaluation. There are indications that this correction is too small for some even-mass isotopes due to the neglect of directcollective effects in the inelastic scattering evaluations. This also follows from comparison with activation and irradiation measurements performed in CFRMF, ZONA- 1, RONA- and PHENIX, respectively. A survey of all the results, expressed by the ratio of experimental to calculated values {{as a function of the}} relative response above 1 keV in the various assemblies, is presented in a summary table.

In recent years important work has been performed {{in the analysis of}} neutron transmission and cross-section data for fissile nuclei in the resonance region by using the computer code SAMMY. The code uses Bayes method (a form of generalized least squares) for sequential analyses of several sets of experimental data. Values for Reich-Moore resonance parameters, their covariances, and the derivatives with respect to the adjusted parameters (data sensitivities) are obtained. In general, the parameter file contains several thousand values and the dimension of the covariance matrices is correspondingly large. These matrices are not reported in the current <b>evaluated</b> data <b>files</b> due to their large dimensions and to the inadequacy of the file formats. The present work has two goals: the first is to calculate the covariances of group-averaged cross sections from the covariance files generated by SAMMY, because these can be more readily utilized in criticality predictability calculations.
