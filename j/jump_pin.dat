40|$|Measuring the ac {{magnetic}} response {{of a type}} II superconductor provides valuable information on the pinning landscape (pinscape) of the material. We use strong pinning theory to derive a microscopic expression for the Campbell length λ_ C, the penetration depth of the ac signal. We show that λ_ C {{is determined by the}} <b>jump</b> in the <b>pinning</b> force, in contrast to the critical current j_c which involves the <b>jump</b> in <b>pinning</b> energy. We demonstrate that the Campbell lengths generically differ for zero-field-cooled and field-cooled samples and predict that hysteretic behavior can appear in the latter situation. We compare our findings with new experimental data and show the potential of this technique in providing information on the material's pinscape. Comment: 5 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

40|$|A {{heterogeneous}} {{brittle material}} {{characterized by a}} random field of local toughness Kc(x) can be represented by an equivalent homogeneous medium of toughness, Keff. Homogenization refers to a process of estimating Keff from the local field Kc(x). An approach based on a perturbative expansion of the stress intensity factor along a rough crack front shows the occurrence of different regimes depending on the correlation length of the local toughness field {{in the direction of}} crack propagation. A `"weak pinning" regime takes place for long correlation lengths, where the effective toughness is the average of the local toughness. For shorter correlation lengths, a transition to "strong pinning" occurs leading to a much higher effective toughness, and characterized by a propagation regime consisting in <b>jumps</b> between <b>pinning</b> configurations...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of vortices in a type-II superconductor with defects are studied by solving the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations {{in two and}} three dimensions. We show that vortex flux tubes are trapped by volume defects up to a critical current density where they begin to <b>jump</b> between <b>pinning</b> sites along static flow channels. We study the dependence of the critical current on the pinning distribution and find for random distributions a maximum critical current equal to a few percent of the depairing current at a pinning density three {{times larger than the}} vortex line density. Whereas for a regular triangular pinning array, the critical current is significantly larger when the pinning density matches the vortex line density. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|Spatially {{discordant}} alternans is {{a widely}} observed pattern of voltage and calcium signals in cardiac tissue that can precipitate lethal cardiac arrhythmia. Using spatially coupled iterative maps of the beat-to-beat dynamics, we explore this pattern's dynamics in the regime of a calcium-dominated period-doubling instability at the single cell level. We find a novel nonlinear bifurcation associated {{with the formation of}} a discontinuous jump in the amplitude of calcium alternans at nodal lines separating discordant regions. We show that this <b>jump</b> unidirectionally <b>pins</b> nodal lines by preventing their motion away from the pacing site following a pacing rate decrease, but permitting motion towards this site following a rate increase. This unidirectional pinning leads to strongly history-dependent nodal line motion that is strongly arrhythmogenic. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{nonlinear}} {{dynamics of}} a transverse domain wall (TDW) in permalloy and nickel nanostrips with two artificially patterned pinning centers is studied numerically up to rf frequencies. The phase diagram frequency-driving amplitude shows a rich variety of dynamical behaviors {{depending on the}} material parameters and the type and shape of pinning centers. We find that T-shaped traps (antinotches) create a classical double well Duffing potential {{that leads to a}} small chaotic region in the case of nickel and a large one for Py. In contrast, the rectangular constrictions (notches) create an exponential potential that leads to larger chaotic regions interspersed with periodic windows for both Py and Ni.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the frequency of}} thermally excited vortex oscillations in Co-Fe-B magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) pillars {{in the presence of}} defects. Under a variable in-plane magnetic field, a characteristic behavior is observed: the frequency oscillates from a maximum at certain field values to a steep minimum, which tends towards zero frequency. These frequency variations are described qualitatively well by an analytical model based on the Thiele equation taking into account a single Gaussian pinning potential. It is thus possible to calculate the in-plane depinning field for certain pinning potential parameters. For steep potentials, the depinning is hysteretic and <b>jumps</b> between the <b>pinned</b> and unpinned regime occur due to the presence of an energy barrier. A sharp frequency minimum occurs at an applied field, where a large flat region in the energy landscape is present. From the experiments, the pinning potentials are estimated to be between 0. 2 eV and 0. 4 eV. We also perform micromagnetic simulations of the vortex oscillations {{in the presence of a}} distribution of pinning centers.

40|$|Measurements of {{the surface}} {{diffusivity}} of colloidal spheres translating along a vapor/liquid inter- face show an unexpected decrease in diffusivity, or increase in surface drag (from the Stokes-Einstein relation) when the particles situate further into the vapor phase. However, direct measurements {{of the surface}} drag from the colloid velocity due to an external force find the expected decrease with deeper immersion into the vapor. The paradoxical drag increase observed in diffusion experiments {{has been attributed to}} the attachment of the fluid interface to heterogeneities on the colloid surface, which causes the interface, in response to thermal fluctuations, to either <b>jump</b> or remain <b>pinned,</b> creating added drag. We have performed molecular dynamics simulations of the diffusivity and force experiments for a nanoparticle with a rough surface at a vapor/liquid interface to examine the effect of contact line fluctuations. The drag calculated from both experiments agree and decrease as the particle positions further into the vapor. The surface drag is smaller than the bulk liquid drag due to the partial submersion into the liquid, and the finite thickness of the interfacial zone relative to the nanoparticle size. Contact line fluctuations do not give rise to an anomalous increase in drag...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. August 2015. Major: Physics. Advisor: Paul Crowell. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); ix, 118 pages. This thesis describes {{the dynamics of}} magnetic domain walls in two very different ferromagnetic systems. In one system, the magnetization prefers to lie in {{the plane of the}} film, which leads to relatively large and complex domain wall structures. In the other system, in which the magnetization is oriented out of the film plane, the domain walls are much smaller and simpler but are more susceptible to the influence of interface effects. In both cases, the dynamics of the domain walls are strongly influenced by the presence of defects, e. g. the inevitable edge and surface roughness of a patterned nanowire. In this dissertation, I explore the resonance dynamics of isolated and coupled transverse domain walls. I show that an intrinsic domain wall mode arises {{as a result of the}} pinning effects of the wire edge roughness, by comparing experimental results with micromagnetic simulations. Because of the strong pinning effects, the dynamics of coupled transverse domain walls are also influenced by the edge roughness, leading to the presence of two distinct modes. Using a simple onedimensional model, the domain wall separation dependence of the two resonant frequencies is explained. As edge roughness is unavoidable, I argue that stochastic pinning effects will be present in other DW resonance experiments. I also explore the propagation of a domain wall through a wire, driven under the influence of magnetic fields and electrical currents. The velocity of the domain wall is shown to follow a model where the domain wall moves via a succession of thermally-activated <b>jumps</b> between <b>pinning</b> sites in the wire. A current-to-field equivalence is established, and the nature of this equivalence is explored through the application of static magnetic fields in the plane of the film. These fields influence the internal structure of the domain wall and thus the torques generated by the current. From the symmetry of these torques, it is revealed that the application of a current leads to a spin-Hall effect in an adjacent non-magnetic layer in the film structure, which influences the domain wall dynamics. A nontrivial suppression of the current-to-field efficiency is observed under large in-plane fields, which is potentially linked to how the domain wall moves through a defect landscape...|$|R
