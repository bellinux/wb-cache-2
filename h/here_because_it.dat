25|$|We must {{be careful}} <b>here,</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is quite {{possible}} that an algorithm will (temporarily) leave blanks in between figures, then come back and fill something in. More likely, an algorithm may do this intentionally. In fact, Turing’s machine does this—it prints on alternate squares, leaving blanks between figures so it can print locator symbols.|$|E
25|$|Peripheral {{blood is}} {{collected}} from patients and ctDNA is isolated from ≥1 mL of plasma. DNA libraries are made using the KAPA Library kit with some modifications {{in order to}} optimize protocols for use with ctDNA. The KAPA HiFi polymerase is used <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> {{is the most effective}} and produces the fewest number of errors. Input DNA can be as low as 4ng.|$|E
25|$|This type is {{mentioned}} <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is very familiar in comics and other drawings, as a wrongly-drawn twin-hose two-cylinder aqualung regulator, with one wide hose {{coming out of}} each cylinder top to the mouthpiece with no apparent regulator valve, much more often than a correctly-drawn twin-hose regulator (and often of such breathing sets being used by combat frogmen): see Frogman#Errors about frogmen found in public media. It would not work in the real world.|$|E
5000|$|We {{wanted to}} signal {{that this was}} the end of it, to stay where you are, bring the {{revolution}} to where you live and don't come <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>it's</b> over and done with.|$|R
6000|$|She {{heard him}} say: [...] "Look at my sister. She isn't a bad woman by any means. She asks me <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>it's</b> right and proper, I suppose, {{but she has}} no use for me. There you have your shore people. I quite {{understand}} anybody crying. I would have been gone already, only, truth to say, I haven't any friends to go to." [...] He added brusquely: [...] "And you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] {{said the}} editor. [...] "I am working <b>here</b> alone <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is so quiet." [...] He {{thought he would}} {{precipitate}} some explanation from her by excusing himself.|$|R
25|$|The {{outermost}} {{layer of}} the Uranian atmosphere, extending for thousands of kilometres, is the thermosphere/exosphere, which has a uniform temperature of around 800 to 850K. This is much higher than, for instance, the 420K observed in the thermosphere of Saturn. The heat sources necessary to sustain such high temperatures are not understood, since neither solar FUV/EUV radiation nor auroral activity can provide the necessary energy. The weak cooling efficiency due to the depletion of hydrocarbons in the stratosphere may contribute to this phenomenon. In addition to molecular hydrogen, the thermosphere contains {{a large proportion of}} free hydrogen atoms, while helium is thought to be absent <b>here,</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> separates diffusively at lower altitudes.|$|E
500|$|... decltype is {{essential}} <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> preserves {{the information about}} whether the wrapped function returns a reference type.|$|E
500|$|The popular veneration of Nyuserre during {{earlier times}} {{continued}} {{to influence the}} cults performed during the New Kingdom. This is best exemplified by the Karnak king list, composed {{during the reign of}} Thutmosis III, with the purpose of honouring a selection of royal ancestors and which includes the cartouche showing [...] "Iny" [...] for Nyuserre. This choice is unusual, as cartouches normally include the king's praenomen rather than a birth name, [...] "Iny" [...] being likely chosen <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was under this name that Nyuserre was venerated and had become deified.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{will be able}} {{to throw}} up a line of these rocks before they get <b>here,</b> and <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is in the open we can hold them back a few hours." ...|$|R
5000|$|Delanoë {{was stabbed}} on 5 October 2002 during the Nuit Blanche, {{a night of}} festivities in Paris, while {{mingling}} with the public. His assailant was a Muslim immigrant, Azedine Berkane, who reportedly told police that [...] "he hated politicians, the Socialist Party, and homosexuals." [...] Speaking to Le Monde, one of his neighbors said, [...] "He was a bit like us. We're all homophobic <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>it's</b> not natural." [...] Before being taken to hospital, Delanoë ordered that the festivities continue. Delanoë's wound was not life-threatening and he left the hospital after about two weeks.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Can't say for certain,' {{replied the}} Bayswater General. 'They've gone {{up here in}} a great hurry, anyhow. They've simply turned their horses loose, because they couldn't take them up. I fancy I know. I fancy they're trying {{to get over the}} ridge to Kensingston or Hammersmith, or somewhere, and are {{striking}} up <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>it's</b> just beyond the end of our line. Damned fools, not to have gone further along the road, though. They've only just shaved our last outpost. Lambert is hardly four hundred yards from here. And I've sent him word.' ...|$|R
500|$|The Brothers Poem follows {{shortly after}} {{fragment}} 5 in the edition of Sappho preserved by P. Sapph. Obbink, with probably only one column of text between them. [...] Silvio Bär {{argues that the}} poem was deliberately positioned <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> {{was seen as a}} sort of continuation of that fragment by the editor of the Alexandrian edition of Sappho's poetry. [...] He suggests that the poem acts to correct the views put forward in fragment 5: in that poem, Sappho prays to the Nereids, not just for the safe return of her brother but that [...] "whatever his heart desires be fulfilled"; in the Brothers Poem she recognises that such a broad request is out of the competence of the Nereids, and should more properly be addressed to the goddess Hera.|$|E
2500|$|The polar {{form was}} first {{proposed}} by J. Bell and then modified by R. Knop. While several {{different versions of}} the polar method have been described, the version of R. Knop will be described <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is the most widely used, in part due to its inclusion in Numerical Recipes.|$|E
2500|$|The Townhouse Complex {{was built}} in 2005 and has 113 {{apartment}} style living units that accommodate 464 students in single occupancy rooms. The lower density complex features ample shade covering and is located farther from the main Rowan Boulevard/Glassboro business district. However, some students choose to live <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is closer to most academic buildings and quieter than other locations. [...] There is a three story parking garage to accommodate Townhouse residents.|$|E
5000|$|When DeLaria {{appeared}} on The Arsenio Hall Show in 1993, {{she was the}} first openly gay comic to appear on a late-night talk-show. While appearing on the show, DeLaria said, [...] "Hello everybody, my name is Lea DeLaria, and it's great to be <b>here,</b> <b>because</b> <b>it's</b> the 1990s! It's hip to be queer! I'm a big dyke." [...] DeLaria later said she had been told that she should not have used the term dyke on the air. Hall later defended her, saying, [...] "If she wants to call herself a dyke, that's her business." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, we {{are also}} under the spell," [...] he declared, [...] "but I {{think that we are}} <b>here</b> mainly <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is cheap. It is really cheap, you know. To {{appreciate}} it you should try rooms." ...|$|R
30|$|Of course, other, plot-based, methods {{could be}} used to {{estimate}} the population size, perhaps with greater precision. The method described above was mentioned <b>here</b> only <b>because</b> <b>it</b> uses the data already collected in determining the population mean and requires no additional sampling effort.|$|R
2500|$|Art {{historian}} Cornelius Vermeule, in his volume about U.S. {{coins and}} medals, considered the ship on the obverse [...] "straightforward faire for commemorative half-dollars", though {{he found the}} name [...] "" [...] beneath the waves unneeded given the legend on the reverse. The reverse based on the city seal was to him [...] "a harming throwback to colonial days, and in American numismatics to the quasi–federal and state issues of the period 1780 to 1792". Vermeule noted [...] "the baroque motto above Neptune and his group [...] makes it evident that this subject, appealing and amusing in itself, appears <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is the singular characteristic of the City of Hudson on the river of the same name.|$|E
2500|$|The seed of {{the woman}} is predestined to eternal life and the seed of the serpent to damnation. There is neither choice nor chance in this. It was God's purpose from the {{foundation}} of the world. If we did not know this of God, we would know nothing of God and would attribute everything to our own natures. [...] "Here reason keeps a great clamour, and saith, doth God make man to damn him?" [...] Tomkinson replies with the old story of the pots discussing their potter. Thus, repentance is a sign of God's grace working, not what calls forth the grace in the first place. People are not their own saviours because their efforts are always inadequate to the task. Those who live by good works and piety will get only the rewards of the law. On the other hand, what is in a person's heart is put there by God. Reason is at a loss <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> seems that God's requirements are so demanding, no one could satisfy them. Tomkinson retorts, [...] "But what has God taken from you that has so weakened you?" [...] Which is why Jesus came to call sinners, not the righteous. He gives the example of Mary Magdalen.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well! We {{do seem to}} be gittin' along!" [...] He laughed again. [...] "I reckon {{you come}} over <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> seemed kind o' lonesome. Goin' to stay all night with Uncle?" ...|$|E
500|$|In August 2014, {{the song}} [...] "Runaway" [...] (featuring Pusha T) was {{ranked in the}} third {{position}} in Pitchforks list of the 200 [...] "best tracks" [...] released since 2010. During the same week, the publication named it the best album of the 2010s decade — between 2010 and 2014 — commenting, [...] "West broke the ground upon which the new decade's most brilliant architects built their masterworks; Bon Iver, Take Care, Channel Orange, and Good Kid, M.A.A.D City don’t exist without the blueprint of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. The list ends <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>it’s</b> where the decade truly begins." [...] In August 2014, GQ named it the best album of the 21st century.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the fall}} of 1992, Allen called Diane Keaton {{and asked her to}} fill in for Farrow, and she {{immediately}} accepted. When asked if he had re-written the script to fit Keaton's talents, Allen said, [...] "No, I couldn't do that. In a regular script I would have done that upon hiring Diane Keaton. But I couldn't <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>it's</b> a murder mystery, and it's very tightly plotted, so it's very hard to make big changes... I had written part more to what Mia likes to do. Mia likes to do funny things, but she's not as broad a comedian as Diane is. So Diane made this part funnier than I wrote it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What I {{think of}} America. It's the same {{inevitable}} question. I think everything of it. It's the stepping-off place. I've come <b>here</b> at last, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> matters most." ...|$|R

6000|$|... [Footnote 16: Wellhausen, History of Israel, p. 437. Mr. Oxford's book is only noticed <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> {{is meant}} for a popular manual. As Mr. Henry Foker says, 'it seems a pity that the clergy should {{interfere}} in these matters.'] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see, {{there are}} two," [...] he answered, {{looking down at}} her. [...] "One I shall most surely tell you before I leave <b>here,</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is the one secret which no man has ever succeeded in keeping to himself. As for the other--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Which," [...] I interrupted, [...] "is {{but another}} title for Isis. Tell me, is her worship {{continued}} <b>here?</b> I ask <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is now dead in Egypt, which was its home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because {{thou art}} Cleopatra's slave, and must march in gilded chains behind her chariot; because she fears to leave thee <b>here</b> in Khem; <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is her will, {{and there is}} an end." ...|$|R
5000|$|Robin said, [...] "Everyone {{told us what}} a great record {{they thought}} it was, Other groups all raved about it {{but for some reason}} people in Britain just did not seem to like it". Barry said [...] "I think the reason it didn't do well <b>here</b> was <b>because</b> <b>it's</b> a soul number, Americans loved it, but it just wasn't right for this country".|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is quite}} all right, Paddy," [...] said she softly. [...] "These little folks {{are trying to}} gain a little {{knowledge}} of themselves and other folks, {{and we are going}} to have this morning's lesson right <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is to be about you." ...|$|E

6000|$|There are, in short, {{hundreds}} of pages of such [...] "chanting" [...] with its grain of wheat hid in a bushel of chaff. We refer to <b>it</b> <b>here</b> not <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is worth reading but to record the curious fact that many European critics hail it as typical American poetry, even while we wonder why anybody should regard it as either American or poetic.|$|R
6000|$|... "From the first, when we {{came here}} we did so with our eyes open. If we had merely sought safety, we {{should have gone to}} England. We came <b>here</b> partly <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is my home, and {{therefore}} my proper place; and partly because, in case La Vendee rose against these executioners of Paris, every man of honour and loyalty should aid in the good cause." ...|$|R
