40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>illness</b> <b>behavior</b> was {{introduced}} to indicate {{the ways in which}} given symptoms may be perceived, evaluated and acted upon at an individual level. <b>Illness</b> <b>behavior</b> may vary greatly according to illness-related, patient-related and doctor-related variables and their complex interactions. In the past decades, important lines of research have been concerned with illness perception, frequent attendance at medical facilities, health care-seeking behavior, treatment-seeking behavior, delay in seeking treatment, and treatment adherence. They have, however, mostly investigated single aspects separately. In this concise review, we suggest that the concept of <b>illness</b> <b>behavior</b> may provide a unifying framework and useful insights to observations and findings that would otherwise remain scattered and unrelated in the medical literature. The wide range of expressions of <b>illness</b> <b>behavior</b> is likely to affect the presentation of any disease and its identification, course and treatment.

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this {{dissertation}} was to examine age-related trajectories in illness behavior—or perceptions, evaluations, and responses to symptoms—across the late-life transition, the predictive role of perceived social support availability, {{and the extent to}} which <b>illness</b> <b>behavior</b> mediates the association of social support with subsequent functional decline. For Study 1, two large population-based samples were drawn from the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging (SATSA) and the Sex Differences in Health and Aging study (GENDER) to examine longitudinal measurement invariance in <b>illness</b> <b>behavior.</b> The extent to which social support availability from friends versus family members predicted reduced levels and change in <b>illness</b> <b>behavior</b> across 17 years from mid- to late-adulthood in SATSA was also examined. Confirmatory factor analyses supported strict factorial invariance in the <b>illness</b> <b>behavior</b> factor across four waves in SATSA, whereas partial, weak factorial invariance was supported in GENDER. Latent growth models suggested, a small, linear increase in <b>illness</b> <b>behavior</b> across age, and perceived support from friends and family both predicted reduced levels of illness behavior—but not change—after controlling for sex, comorbidity, SES, marital status, and age at study entry. For Study 2, age-related change in functional difficulty was evaluated across 23 years in SATSA, as well as the extent to which social support availability (again, from friends versus family) buffered decline. Additionally, longitudinal mediation models evaluated the extent to which <b>illness</b> <b>behavior</b> explained the association between social support availability and subsequent functional status and change. Overall, findings suggested piecewise growth in functional difficulty, with stability prior to age 75 and a linear increase afterward. Higher family support availability predicted faster decline, whereas friend support was not associated. Furthermore, <b>illness</b> <b>behavior</b> status mediated the association between social support availability and functional status; whereas intra-individual growth in <b>illness</b> <b>behavior</b> separately predicted a faster rate of functional decline. Collectively, these results suggest that <b>illness</b> <b>behavior,</b> as a unifying individual difference construct, exhibits systematic intra-individual change and significant variability during the transition to late adulthood, and represents a potentially important mediating and independent pathway linking perceived social support availability with subsequent physical functioning...|$|E

40|$|Many {{researchers}} have reported {{gender differences in}} levels of reported symptoms, morbidity, mortality and medical care utilization, but the debate continues about {{the underlying causes of}} these differences. Some have argued that women use more medical services because they are more sensitive to symptoms and interested in health, while others believe that women's greater service utilization arises from the fact that women experience more morbidities than do men. To date, these questions have not been studied prospectively. Using data from a household interview survey carried out in 1970 - 1971 and linked to 22 years of health services utilization records, we explored the effects of gender, self-reported health status, mental and physical symptom levels, health knowledge, <b>illness</b> <b>behaviors</b> and health concerns and interest on the long-term use of health services. After controlling for the aforementioned factors, female gender remained an independent predictor of higher utilization over the 22 -year period studied, and psychosocial and health factors measured at the initial interview predicted service use even 19 - 22 years later. Controlling for factors identified as likely causes of gender-related differences in healthcare utilization, gender remains an important predictor of medical care use before and after removing sex-specific utilization. In addition, the consistent predictive ability of attitudinal and behavioral factors, combined with the finding that health knowledge did not predict utilization, indicates that efforts to help patients assess their service needs should target the attitudinal and behavioral factors that vary with gender, rather than health-related knowledge alone.

40|$|BACKGROUND: While {{gastroesophageal}} reflux is {{amenable to}} medical and surgical treatment, {{the severity of}} pathophysiologic changes of the disease correlates poorly with the symptomatology. Similarly, the overall successful outcome of surgical therapy can be lessened by the poor outcome in {{a small number of}} patients despite the technical success of the operation. We conducted a study to determine the influence of <b>illness</b> <b>behavior</b> on the outcome and efficacy of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. STUDY DESIGN: From a larger group of patients undergoing a laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication, 77 patients (57 male, 20 female) completed an <b>illness</b> <b>behavior</b> questionnaire before and after surgery. This previously validated questionnaire assessed 10 scales of <b>illness</b> <b>behavior.</b> The results were compared with visual analog scales of outcome for overall satisfaction, heartburn, and solid food dysphagia, which were elicited independently from a standardized clinical follow-up questionnaire. RESULTS: Patients completed the questionnaire on average 2 months before and 25 months after surgery. High preoperative and postoperative scores for the "affective" and "hypochondriacal" scales were associated with poorer satisfaction with the surgical outcome. Although successful relief of reflux symptoms was unrelated to any preoperative <b>illness</b> <b>behavior</b> scale, postoperative scores for "disease conviction" and "disease affirmation" were predictors of further symptomatic heartburn in a small group of patients. Dysphagia did not correlate with <b>illness</b> <b>behavior.</b> When preoperative and postoperative scores were compared, no change in <b>illness</b> <b>behavior</b> was demonstrated, with the exception of lower scores for disease conviction and disease affirmation. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that while patient perception of disease is improved by laparoscopic fundoplication, patient satisfaction with the surgical outcome is in part determined by preoperative <b>illness</b> <b>behavior...</b>|$|E

40|$|Background: Over {{the last}} years {{the way in which}} {{patients}} with chronic physical illness respond to their illness (<b>illness</b> <b>behavior)</b> has been explored by several studies. This study sought to examine characteristics of <b>illness</b> <b>behavior</b> and to investigate the association between <b>illness</b> <b>behavior</b> and psychosocial and clinical variables among asymptomatic HIV-infected subjects. Methods: Seventy-three asymptomatic HIV+ outpatients completed self-report questionnaires to evaluate <b>illness</b> <b>behavior</b> (<b>Illness</b> <b>Behavior</b> Questionnaire), psychological stress symptoms (Brief Symptom Inventory), personality variables (External Locus of Control and Courtauld Emotional Control Scales) and social support (Social Provision Scale). Results: Psychological morbidity (‘caseness’ = 34 %) was associated with a pattern of illness behaviour characterized by conviction of disease progression, irritability, dysphoria, psychological perception of illness and low denial. Individual capacity to express emotions, adequate levels of social support and low levels of depression, as well as clinical variables (high number of CD 4 + cells, recent notification of HIV infection and nonintravenous drug use category) influenced a more adaptive illness behaviour. Conclusions: Psychosocial variables resulted to influence the tendency to interpret illness in a nonadaptive way in asymptomatic HIV-infected subjects.

40|$|Ph. D. (Psychology) In {{this study}} the <b>illness</b> <b>behavior</b> {{of people with}} a life {{threatening}} illness was described {{and the relationship between}} stress, affect and <b>illness</b> <b>behavior</b> investigated. An overview of the literature shows that the <b>illness</b> <b>behavior</b> patients exhibit is and should be an important consideration in the diagnosis of illness and treatment of patients. This is evident in reports of a high amount of ill people who do not receive treatment and the high amount of patients who seek treatment for minor ailments.

40|$|SUMMARY. Psychological {{factors are}} {{believed}} {{to play a role}} in gastroesophageal reflux disease. It has previously been shown that preoperative <b>illness</b> <b>behavior</b> influences the outcome after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. Between August 2001 and June 2004 we considered a partly subjective assessment of <b>illness</b> <b>behavior</b> when selecting patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease for laparoscopic anterior partial (n = 77) or total fundoplication (n = 90). A prospective questionnaire study of <b>illness</b> <b>behavior</b> was also undertaken and the results were correlated with clinical follow up after 12 months. There was a statistically significant difference in age (P < 0. 001), primary esophageal peristalsis on manometry (P = 0. 037) and two <b>illness</b> <b>behavior</b> category scores related to hypochondriasis (P = 0. 041 and P = 0. 025) between laparoscopic anterior partial fundoplication and Nissen total fundoplication groups. Despite these differences, there was no significant correlation between preoperative <b>illness</b> <b>behavior</b> score and patient satisfaction in either group. There was a statistically significant negative correlation between the ability to express personal feelings and postoperative heartburn score in those who had a laparoscopic anterior partial fundoplication (P = 0. 048).
