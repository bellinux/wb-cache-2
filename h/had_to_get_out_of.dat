25|$|The Kayak Experience: After {{the second}} visitor {{death in the}} park's history in 1982 {{occurred}} at this ride, it was closed permanently. It was an imitation whitewater course that used submerged electric fans to agitate the water above. Frequently the kayaks got stuck or tipped over, and people <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> them to remedy the situation.|$|E
25|$|It transpired from Coast Guard radio logs {{that the}} ship's captain, Kim Gap Bong, had been {{repeatedly}} {{warned of the}} danger of trying to enter the harbor. The captain, however, was insistent that he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the storm. Blue Magpies chief officer, Kang Tae Jung, later explained that their situation had been desperate. The ship had spent nine hours on a violent sea, and was in serious danger of capsizing.|$|E
500|$|In a {{television}} interview, {{one of the}} NTSB investigators suggested that [...] "the captain was faced with quite a problem. If {{he wanted to be}} deiced a third time, he would have <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the line [...] and taxi {{all the way back to}} the parking area and meet up with a deicing truck again. That would have put him very, very late and it may have even caused the cancellation of the flight." ...|$|E
25|$|The driver {{does not}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> {{of the car}} while the battery is swapped.|$|R
50|$|Going Mobile is the series' {{first game}} for mobile phones. Ratchet and Clank are trapped inside the McGuFFin and they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "We shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out,</b> {{and draw}} the canoes overland, I suppose. Three hours will be lost, {{and in the}} very hottest of the day, too." ...|$|R
2500|$|Valerie Grove, who {{conceded that}} Metro-land was [...] "a kinder word than 'suburbia'" [...] and {{referred}} to the less spoilt areas beyond Rickmansworth as [...] "Outer Metro-land", maintained that [...] "suburbia had no visible history. Anyone with any spirit ... <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Metro-land to make their mark".|$|E
2500|$|The Philips Record company's {{studio was}} slated as [...] "an {{extremely}} dead studio", {{it felt as}} though it had turned the treble down: [...] "There was no [...] and it was like singing in a padded cell. I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> there". Springfield would end up in the ladies' toilets for its superior acoustics. Another example of refusal to use the studio is [...] "I Close My Eyes and Count to Ten" [...] – recorded {{at the end of a}} corridor.|$|E
2500|$|Marking Emotion as a {{transitional}} piece, Jepsen's intent to cultivate her sound was commended. In writing for Vulture, Lindsay Zolads contemplates Jepsen's career after the album: [...] "Maybe bona fide stardom {{was just something}} banal and predictable Jepsen <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the way early, freeing her up for a future of bolder aesthetic choices, unexpected left turns, and a joyful freedom from the pop game’s stuffy rules." [...] James Rettig of Stereogum writes, [...] "It feels like an autonomous artistic breakthrough for Jepsen, {{the start of a}} new chapter of her career." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{will they}} come through this way? Faith, av' they do, they'll have as hard work <b>to</b> <b>get</b> in, as they'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> by and by." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What,' he said, 'dress up {{that little}} wretch to {{represent}} me? Why, I shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of the country! My reputation will be ruined for ever.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's nice to {{hear you}} say so," [...] she sighed. [...] "Well, I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> here. This is where I live, up on the fourth floor." ...|$|R
2500|$|Cohn {{expressed}} his frustration in a 1957 interview with Time magazine: [...] "Hayworth {{might be worth}} ten million dollars today easily! She owned 25% of the profits with her own company and had hit after hit {{and she had to}} get married and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the business and took a suspension because she fell in love again! In five years, at two pictures a year, at 25%! Think of what she could have made! But she didn't make pictures! She took two or three suspensions! She got mixed up with different characters! Unpredictable!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The trio of Calder, Simon and Lange {{decided in}} 1974 that they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> South Africa. [...] "We were {{politically}} very much {{opposed to the}} old apartheid regime" [...] says Simon. [...] They pooled together what little money they had and moved to London. [...] Having landed {{right in the middle}} of the British punk rock movement, they felt their experience would not be best utilized in marketing and promotion in such a different context. [...] Instead, they opted to create a publishing company and Zomba Corporation was officially registered in Switzerland in 1975, operating out of Calder's bedroom space in London. [...] The name [...] "Zomba" [...] referred to the capital of African country Malawi (Lilongwe superseded Zomba as Malawi's capital in 1974).|$|E
60|$|Presently John Barrow <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the wagon}} to fix {{something}} on the harness. While {{he was doing this}} Dick leaned over to his two brothers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Marry her! No, indeed. I am not mad. I shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of the scrape as best I can--always supposing {{my view of}} {{the lady}} is correct." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Complicated {{series of}} {{gestures}} and passes with the hands. That's {{how he had}} come in and that's how he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> again. Lord! what a business I had!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A bear! I'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of here!" [...] he ejaculated, and {{snatching}} up his {{fish and}} {{line and the}} axe he started on {{a run for the}} shelter.|$|R
6000|$|... "More of them around!" [...] {{said the}} sailor grimly. [...] "There's trouble coming {{to them if}} they mean to corral us. Jake's at the side window, and he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Mobile {{because he was too}} handy with his gun. Not often had to pull mine, but I can shoot some." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are {{all very}} well for common people. But the point was, Kemp, that I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> that house in a {{disguise}} without his seeing me. I couldn't think of any other way of doing it. And then I gagged him with a Louis Quatorze vest and tied him up in a sheet." ...|$|E
60|$|A halloo {{caused her}} to stop and turn. Two pack-horses were jogging up the trail. Kells was driving them and leading her pony. Nothing could be seen of the other men. Kells rapidly {{overhauled}} her, and she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the trail to let the pack-animals pass. He threw her bridle to her.|$|E
6000|$|... "It doesn't pay to {{know more}} than the boss," [...] he said; and {{then he looked at}} Weston. [...] "He <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out.</b> What are you going to do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By Jove, {{that is a}} scheme!" [...] exclaimed the rascally parent. [...] "Langless, {{will you}} do it? Of course, we'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of sight until the proper moment arrives." ...|$|R
60|$|The bundle was sewn together, and {{the doctor}} <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> his instrument-case, and cut the {{stitches}} with his medical scissors. It contained two things--a book and a sealed paper.|$|R
60|$|Barringford {{was as good}} as his word, {{and went}} down without an effort, his water-soaked {{clothing}} aiding him to sink. He caught hold of the rock and the roots and strained his eyes in all directions. Then the rock began to move once more, and he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the way just as Henry had done.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not. Guess she'd {{make you}} feel mean for a month after if you did. I want you to remember, all the time, that I'm sure of your sister--but I don't like the man. He <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Toronto--and they're talking about him already in the saloons. Seems to me she's playing a {{dangerous}} game in fooling him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've had {{something}} preying on my mind, uncle, and as I am going away, and might never see you again, I can't bear it any longer. I made you believe I {{was afraid to}} fight that Italian adventurer. I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it on some pretext or other, and maybe I chose badly, being taken unawares, but no honorable person could consent to meet him in the field, knowing what I knew about him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out,</b> {{what are}} we to do?" [...] {{questioned}} Randy, soberly. [...] "I don't believe we can get work, unless we go into the woods as mere choppers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jim's right," [...] sighed the Wizard. [...] "There's {{going to}} be trouble, and my sword isn't stout enough to cut up those wooden bodies--so I shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> my revolvers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{had a big}} quarrel {{after that}} raid, Ward," [...] {{explained}} the parent. [...] "And now those greasers have no use for us. We'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out,</b> and in a hurry, too." ...|$|R
6000|$|Finding {{that the}} {{propeller}} would now work, Captain Williamson gave orders for full speed astern. As {{soon as the}} engines started there was more crashing of ice, the small stuff being ground down under the ship, and the ice of the pinnacle breaking off along the shrouds. Everybody on deck <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the way, for the deck took on the appearance of [...] "an ice-house upset," [...] as Chet put it, big chunks of the frozen material lying in all directions.|$|E
6000|$|Dorothea {{had another}} errand in Lowick Gate: {{it was about}} a new fine-toned bell for the school-house, and as she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her {{carriage}} very near to Lydgate's, she walked thither across the street, having told the coachman to wait for some packages. The street door was open, and the servant was taking the opportunity of looking out at the carriage which was pausing within sight when it became apparent to her that the lady who [...] "belonged to it" [...] was coming towards her.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{might call}} it sneaking if you like, but I would do it, for I hate such brutal cruelty. I don't see how {{it could have been}} any of the fellows, for they would have <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the bedroom and into it again; besides, I don't see how they could have caught the cat if they did get out; but whether {{it was one of the}} fellows or not makes no difference. I say it's {{injustice}} to punish every one for the fault of one or two fellows.|$|E
6000|$|Bridge {{shook his}} head ruefully. [...] "We'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of this in a hurry now," [...] he said. [...] "That little {{defective}} will have the whole neighborhood on us in an hour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out,</b> Oliver," [...] it said. [...] "Clear {{out in your}} sloop {{with the}} folks you have with you and we'll let you go. You're mighty lucky in getting the option." ...|$|R
60|$|Wampus <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> and crank the engines, {{which he}} calmly {{proceeded}} to do. The {{man who had}} called himself Algernon Tobey perceived his intention and urged his pony {{to the front of}} the car.|$|R
