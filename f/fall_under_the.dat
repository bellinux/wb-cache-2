This culminated in the 1912 Bulu uprising led by Martin-Paul Samba, a German-trained man much like Atangana. The rebellion was crushed and Samba executed.|$|E

5|$|According to Herodotus, Pausanias {{refused to}} advance because good omens were not divined in the goat sacrifices that were performed. At this point, as Greek {{soldiers}} began to <b>fall</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> barrage of arrows, the Tegeans {{started to run}} at the Persian lines. Offering one last sacrifice and a prayer to the heavens {{in front of the}} Temple of Hera, Pausanias finally received favourable omens and gave the command for the Spartans to advance, whereupon they also charged the Persian lines.|$|E

This highway exists entirely {{as a part}} of the Kansas Turnpike. In fact, until 1987, this stretch of the turnpike was designated solely as the Kansas Turnpike without an Interstate number. It was only after a change in the National Maximum Speed Law, when state legislators were given the authority to raise the speed limits on rural Interstate Highways to , that this segment of the Kansas Turnpike was given the I-335 designation so that it could <b>fall</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> new law.|$|E

5|$|Deshastha Brahmins <b>fall</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> Pancha Dravida Brahmin {{classification}} of the Brahmin community in India. Other Brahmin sub-castes {{in the region}} are Karhade Brahmin, Devrukhe, Konkanastha and Goud Saraswat Brahmin, but these sub-castes only have a regional significance. Goud Saraswat Brahmins <b>fall</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> Pancha Gauda Brahmin classification, i.e. North Indian Brahmins. The Vedas are the world's oldest texts that are still used in worship and they are the oldest literature of India. Four Vedas exist of which the Rig Veda is the oldest. They were handed down from one generation of Brahmins to the next verbally and memorised by each generation. They were written down sometime around 400 BC. Other Vedas include the Yajur Veda, the Atharva Veda and the Sama Veda. Two different versions of the Yajur Veda exist, the White (Shukla in Sanskrit) and the black or (Krishna in Sanskrit). The Shukla Yajur Veda has a two different branches (Shakha in Sanskrit) called the Kanva and the Madhyandin. Deshastha Brahmins are further classified in two major sub-sects, the Deshashatha Rigvedi and the Deshastha Yajurvedi, based on the Veda they follow. The Yajurvedis are further classified into two groups called the Madhyandins and the Kanavas. The Madhyandins follow the Madhyandin branch of the Shukla Yajur Veda. The word Madhyandin is a fusion of two words Madhya and din which mean middle and day respectively. They are so called because they perform Sandhya Vandana at noon.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{its life}} as a {{tropical}} cyclone, Ewiniar affected Yap and Palau, which <b>fall</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> warning jurisdiction of the National Weather Service office in Tiyan, Guam. Ewiniar caused coastal flooding in Yap of up to 5feet (1.5m), especially near the port and around the Colonia Bay area. Ewiniar also caused an island-wide power outage in Yap, although according to an NWS post-storm report, damage was minimised on Yap due to steadier structures after Super Typhoon Sudal of 2004 tore through the islands. Damage was also reported to agriculture due to salt spray. The total amount of damage caused {{was estimated to be}} just over $100 thousand (2006USD).|$|E
5|$|In 877 the Vikings divided Mercia, {{taking the}} eastern part for {{themselves}} and leaving Ceolwulf with the west.

At almost {{the same time as}} Alfred's victory over the Vikings in 878 at the Battle of Edington, Ceolwulf defeated and killed Rhodri Mawr, king of the north Welsh territory of Gwynedd. After Ceolwulf's disappearance in 879, Mercia began to <b>fall</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> hegemony of Wessex.|$|E

5|$|Residents elect an eight-member {{city council}} {{composed}} of {{representatives of the}} city's seven wards and a council president. The council, in turn, appoints a city clerk. The council traditionally meets every first and third Wednesday of the month. City council meetings are generally held from the third week in September to the third week in June. Meanwhile, the board of control oversees contracts for public projects within the municipal limits.

5|$|The treaty {{ensures that}} all {{citizens}} and companies from signatory countries receive equal {{rights of access}} and residence. Norway may not discriminateâ€”based on nationalityâ€”the rights to fish, hunt and conduct mining, trade, industry and maritime activity. However, these activities may be limited by non-discriminatory legislation. Thus Norway is permitted to place regulations and prohibitions on basis of other objective criteria, or ban certain activities altogether or in certain geographic areas. The non-discrimination clause also does not ban nationality discrimination elsewhere than in economic activity. Specifically, research and scientific activities do not <b>fall</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> non-discrimination clause.|$|E
5|$|Ann Arbor has a {{long history}} of {{openness}} to marijuana, given Ann Arbor's decriminalization of cannabis, the large number of medical marijuana dispensaries in the city (one dispensary, called People's Co-op, was directly across the street from Michigan Stadium until zoning forced it to move one mile to the west), the large number of pro-marijuana residents, and the annual Hash Bash: an event that is held on the first Saturday of April. Until (at least) the successful passage of Michigan's medical marijuana law, the event had arguably strayed from its initial intent, although for years, a number of attendees have received serious legal responses due to marijuana use on University of Michigan property, which does not <b>fall</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> city's progressive and compassionate ticketing program.|$|E

Alien 3 Assembly Cut expands on Golic's part in Alien 3, with Golic persuading Morse to unstrap {{him in the}} {{infirmary}} when he hears that the Alien has been trapped. He knocks Morse out, goes to the containment chamber containing the Alien, kills Arthur (who is guarding the door) and releases the creatureâ€”which promptly kills him. In an August 1992 Elle magazine article, McGann said that Golic intends to release the Alien {{in the hope that}} he can collaborate with it to kill the humans on Fury 161. Alien 3 editor Terry Rawlings said in the 2003 special-edition DVD release of the Alien Anthology that a parallel exists between Golic and Renfield in Dracula; both are deranged lunatics, who <b>fall</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> influence of a paranormal entity which they try to appease.|$|E
5|$|On October 7, 2014, {{the ports}} of Seattle and Tacoma {{formally}} announced {{their intention to}} move management of their marine cargo businesses to a joint alliance in March, ending decades of competition, because of increased threats from British Columbia and other ports. A full merger, including the two port commissions, was opposed by Tacoma, who feared that the more populous King County would have more votes on the combined commission than Pierce County, who were more dependent on the cargo port. In March 2015, the plan was pushed back to August while working on specifics of the alliance, including a decision on which legal entity it would <b>fall</b> <b>under.</b> <b>The</b> Washington State Legislature and Governor Jay Inslee approved {{the creation of a}} port development authority, similar to Washington's existing public development authority designation, in late April.|$|E
5|$|Rorquals {{consist of}} two genera (Balaenoptera and Megaptera) and nine species: the fin whale (B. physalus), the Sei whale (B. borealis), Bryde's whale (B. brydei), Eden's whale (B. edeni), the blue whale (B. musculus), the common minke whale (B. acutorostrata), the Antarctic minke whale (B. bonaerensis), Omura's whale (B. omurai), and the {{humpback}} whale (M. novaeangliae). In a 2012 review of cetacean taxonomy, Alexandre Hassanin (of the MusÃ©um National d'Histoire Naturelle) and colleagues suggested that, based on phylogenic criteria, {{there are four}} extant genera of rorquals. They recommend that the genus Balaenoptera {{be limited to the}} fin whale, have minke whales <b>fall</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> genus Pterobalaena, and have Rorqualus contain the Sei whale, Bryde's whale, Eden's whale, the blue whale, and Omura's whale.|$|E
