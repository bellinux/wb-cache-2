Both engine crew were severely injured by escaping steam and jumping from the moving locomotive.|$|E

5|$|On 10 March 2000, a {{passenger}} train collided with an <b>empty</b> <b>stock</b> train in platform 5 due to driver error. Thirty-five people were injured. On 15 August 2017, a Class 456 electric multiple unit collided with an engineers' train at the station. The passenger train was derailed, causing disruption {{for the remainder}} of the day. Three people were checked for injuries, but nobody was hospitalised.|$|E
5|$|On 3 June 1960, an <b>empty</b> <b>stock</b> train formed of two 4COR {{electric}} {{multiple units}} overran signals {{and was in}} a sidelong collision with a steam-hauled passenger train that was departing for , Dorset. A few people suffered slight injuries. On 11 April the following year, an electric multiple unit overran signals and was in a head-on collision with a steam locomotive. One person was killed and fifteen were injured.|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{were now}} made {{to find a}} role for the {{remaining}} 19 locomotives. By now many had been relegated to hauling trains in what were once seen as remote outposts of the LMS. Often they were reduced to pulling stopping trains, <b>empty</b> <b>stock</b> trains, or even goods trains. Only one realistic mainline role was contemplated: to replace the Scottish Region A4 Class on the testing route between Edinburgh Waverley and Aberdeen. This idea was discarded largely {{because it would be}} excessively problematic to train the A4 crews to operate the Coronations. With no credible role, only one option remained: in July 1964 it was resolved that the remaining 19 locomotives were to be withdrawn from 12 September.|$|E
50|$|In 1931, the Atlanta Jaycees {{joined the}} Atlanta Georgian (a Hearst {{newspaper}} that {{merged with the}} Atlanta Journal in 1939) and fused their efforts in the Atlanta <b>Empty</b> <b>Stocking</b> Fund begun by Georgian Editor James B. Nevin in 1927. In 1939 it became the Atlanta Jaycee Journal-Constitution <b>Empty</b> <b>Stocking</b> Fund, Inc. The program has now become the largest of its type in the United States. In 1997, the Atlanta Jaycees and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution ceded control of the charity to a community {{board of directors and}} a professional staff in an effort to ensure that the service provided would continue to expand within the Atlanta community. At the high point of the Junior Chamber’s role in managing this charity (1994-95), the <b>Empty</b> <b>Stocking</b> Fund purchased toys for 80,000 children by raising well over $1,000,000.|$|R

She wrote an essay that was included in Methodism and the Negro (1910).|$|R
25|$|Since {{the death}} of a driver in 1971, when an <b>empty</b> <b>stock</b> train did not stop in tunnel sidings, London Underground had been {{introducing}} speed controls at such locations.

It was built in 1973.|$|E
25|$|A short spur line, {{partly in}} tunnel, runs from Manors to Jesmond; this line {{is used for}} <b>empty</b> <b>stock</b> {{movements}} only, and has no passenger service.

50|$|The {{newspaper}} was struggling when William Randolph Hearst purchased {{it in the}} spring of 1912 (his ninth newspaper property); he transformed it into a yellow press, making it much more successful, if less respected. Journalist James B. Nevin became editor (continuing until his death in 1931) and started the <b>Empty</b> <b>Stocking</b> Fund in 1927. That year the {{newspaper was}} awarded the Sutlive Trophy, given by the Georgia Press Association.|$|R

25|$|The {{line from}} Groombridge to Tunbridge Wells West {{remained}} open until 1985, although in its latter years passenger services {{were confined to}} a shuttle service between Tonbridge via the single line connection to Tunbridge Wells Central and Eridge, although the station's depot provided rolling stock for services on the Uckfield and East Grinstead - London (via East Croydon) lines meaning {{there were plenty of}} <b>empty</b> <b>stock</b> moves early and late in the day.|$|E
25|$|Although First {{had planned}} to return the entire fleet for storage, it decided to retain three units until it had {{received}} a cascaded HST from National Express East Coast. A pair of the units operated in multiple on an early-morning Oxford-London commuter service, before being divided to work independently {{the rest of the}} day (after returning as <b>empty</b> <b>stock</b> to Oxford) on the Cotswold Line from Paddington to Worcester and Hereford. The final FGW 180 ran on 30 March 2009.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of the two request halts (Country Park and Northwood), all intermediate stations have the ability to pass trains on the single line. However, Highley's passing loop lacks a platform and Facing Point Locks on points to attached sidings, a legal requirement for passenger-carrying line, meaning trains carrying fare-paying passengers may not use this loop. However, it is frequently used for works trains, demonstration goods trains and <b>empty</b> <b>stock</b> workings. Despite this, the Severn Valley Railway offers, possibly, the most intensive service on any single line heritage railway.|$|E

50|$|The {{station tracks}} {{continued}} {{to be used for}} stabling <b>empty</b> coaching <b>stock</b> until the summer of 1965, but were then lifted. The goods yard continued in operation until 9 October 1972.|$|R
25|$|London Underground {{regularly}} moved {{stock for}} the Northern City Line along the old lines between Highgate Wood Depot, Finsbury Park and Drayton Park Depot until September 1970. The movements ran regularly on Tuesdays, and occasionally on Mondays and Wednesdays. The tracks were removed in 1971 following which the Northern City Line <b>empty</b> <b>stock</b> movements ran from Neasden via King's Cross (York Road) and the Widened Lines. The {{sections of the}} line from Finsbury Park to the southern portals of the southern tunnels at Highgate station and between the sites of Cranley Gardens and Muswell Hill stations now form a linear urban park known as Parkland Walk. Stretches of the Mill Hill East to Edgware line are now local nature reserves: Copthall Railway Walk and Mill Hill Old Railway Nature Reserve.|$|E
25|$|Following {{a lack of}} {{investment}} for decades, by the early 1980s the track and signalling between Eridge and Tunbridge Wells needed to be replaced. British Rail, at the time carrying out an upgrade of the Tonbridge to Hastings Line, decided {{that the costs of}} keeping the line from Eridge open and undertaking the resignalling and relaying Grove Junction works did not justify the outlay. It therefore announced the closure of the line (including Groombridge and Tunbridge Wells West stations) from 16 May 1983, subsequently postponed following objections. The Secretary of State for Transport approved the decision with effect for passenger trains from 6 July 1985, although <b>empty</b> <b>stock</b> trains continued to use the section from Tunbridge Wells West to Birchden Junction until 10 August when the depot at West station closed. Since 1971, the line had been served by an hourly off-peak shuttle service between Tonbridge and Eridge with extra services during Monday to Friday peak hours.|$|E
25|$|As the {{popularity}} of the motorcar increased, train services were severely cut back {{due to the lack of}} patronage, and the number of services passing through Tunbridge Wells West declined as one line after another was closed from the 1950s onwards. First, the East Grinstead to Lewes line closed in 1958, then the Cuckoo Line in 1965, the Three Bridges to Groombridge in 1967, and finally the Wealden Line in 1969. Tunbridge Wells West was itself listed for closure in 1966, only to be subsequently reprieved. The line to Tunbridge Wells West remained open, although in its latter years passenger services were mainly confined to a shuttle service between Tonbridge (via the single line connection to Tunbridge Wells Central - now plain Tunbridge Wells) and Eridge with a few through trains to Uckfield; however there was a depot at the station which housed rolling stock for services on the Uckfield and East Grinstead - London (via East Croydon) lines, and there were plenty of <b>empty</b> <b>stock</b> moves early and late in the day.|$|E

50|$|Following the British Railways Modernisation Plan, ten of {{the class}} were ordered for {{evaluation}} under the 'pilot scheme'. Like other locomotives designed to the 'Type 1' specification, they were intended for use on local freight and <b>empty</b> coaching <b>stock</b> trains.|$|R
50|$|As of 2014 the GWML has {{a regular}} {{passenger}} service; the NNML (now partially singled) {{is used by}} freight trains and <b>empty</b> coaching <b>stock</b> movements with just one weekday passenger train each way between Gerrards Cross and London Paddington via West Ruislip.|$|R
