5|$|Aerosmith is an American Grammy Award-winning {{hard rock}} band formed in 1970 in Boston, Massachusetts. They have {{released}} 15 studio albums: Aerosmith (1973), Get Your Wings (1974), Toys in the Attic (1975), Rocks (1976), Draw the Line (1977), Night in the Ruts (1979), Rock in a <b>Hard</b> <b>Place</b> (1982), Done with Mirrors (1985), Permanent Vacation (1987), Pump (1989), Get a Grip (1993), Nine Lives (1997), Just Push Play (2001), Honkin' on Bobo (2004), and Music from Another Dimension! (2012). Each album {{was released by}} either the Columbia Records or Geffen Records record label.|$|E
5|$|Upheaval {{within the}} band {{occurred}} from 1983 onwards. First Bill McDonough left, then his brother Guy McDonough died in 1984, then various other members left. Their 1985 release Between a Rock and a <b>Hard</b> <b>Place</b> was expensive but sales were disappointing; and they disbanded early in 1986. The band's {{status as an}} icon on the Australian music scene was acknowledged by induction into the 1996 Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame. Founding guitarist Brad Robinson was unable to attend the Hall of Fame induction in person, as he was hospitalised with lymphoma and died two weeks later.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, {{the band}} {{released}} {{the best of}} their early material as a compilation titled Crawl File, which peaked at numbertwo on the albums charts. Geffen released Semantics, internationally, as a long play album with six newly re-recorded tracks compiled from their first three studio albums. Promotion of the album and the subsequent tour was stalled when Guy McDonough died in June of viral pneumonia. Before Guy's death, he had recorded demos with his brother Bill McDonough, and ex-members of their earlier band, The Flatheads. Bill McDonough assembled the tapes and produced Guy McDonough's posthumous album My Place on Wheatley Records in April 1985. Tracks from these sessions were re-mastered and released on Lost & Found in 1996, credited under the 'Members of Australian Crawl' name. Meanwhile, remaining Australian Crawl members had recorded their fourth studio album, Between a Rock and a <b>Hard</b> <b>Place,</b> which was released in 1985 and achieved number11 on the albums charts. This was followed by the announcement that they would disband after another tour. The live album, The Final Wave recorded their performance on 27 January 1986; it was released in October and peaked at number16 on the albums charts.|$|E

500|$|In 1981, Aerosmith {{began work}} on their next album, which was titled Rock in a <b>Hard</b> <b>Place</b> and saw them reunite with {{producer}} Jack Douglas. Once again, though, they {{would be forced to}} deal with another departure. After the first song for the album, [...] "Lightning Strikes", was recorded Brad Whitford departed the band and decided to form a duo with Derek St. Holmes, with whom he recorded a self-titled album that failed to garner much interest. Whitford later joined up with the Joe Perry Project and played with them in 1984.|$|E
500|$|With Rick Dufay taking Whitford's place, Rock in a <b>Hard</b> <b>Place</b> was {{released}} on August 1, 1982. The album reached number 32 on the Billboard 200 album chart. Only one single charted, the aforementioned [...] "Lightning Strikes", which peaked at number 21 on the Billboard Top Tracks chart. As with the tour for Night in the Ruts, Aerosmith was unable to book larger venues and instead {{had to rely on}} filling clubs and theaters, which they struggled to do. At a show in Worcester, Massachusetts, Tyler and Perry reunited and got high backstage before the show. Tyler was so intoxicated that he collapsed on stage again and, like before, could not get up.|$|E

500|$|By 1985 {{the group}} {{recorded}} their last studio album, Between a Rock and a <b>Hard</b> <b>Place,</b> with English producer Adam Kidron. It {{was released in}} Australia on Australian Crawl's own label Freestyle Records. [...] The album, which allegedly cost $400,000 to record, was a mishmash of styles and a commercial disaster (it peaked at No. 12 in August 1985 but {{slipped out of the}} Top 40 two weeks later). None of the singles had any Top 40 chart success. Harry Brus (Kevin Borich Express) replaced long-standing bass player Paul Williams in May 1985. The band performed three songs for the July 1985 Oz for Africa concert—part of the global Live Aid program—"Reckless (Don't Be So)", [...] "Two Can Play" [...] and [...] "The Boys Light Up". It was broadcast in Australia (on both Seven Network and Nine Network) and on MTV in the US.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{described}} as [...] "uneven" [...] and an [...] "inauspicious start to the second season" [...] by James Van Hise and Hal Schuster in their book The Complete Trek: The Next Generation. While the duo praised the addition of Muldaur and Goldberg, {{the lack of a}} follow-up to the episode was criticised as they felt that the events should have had some type of lasting effect on Troi. It was suggested that either she would want to have a child, or she would be wary of them in general due to the impact of the loss of Ian. Keith DeCandido pointed out several changes at the start of this season in [...] "The Child" [...] that would recur {{throughout the rest of the}} run of The Next Generation in his review for Tor.com. These included moving Geordi La Forge to become chief engineer, placing Miles O'Brien as transporter chief and Riker growing a beard. However, he criticised the fact that Worf's calling for Troi to have an abortion was never mentioned again, but added that it was discussed in a non-canon novel, A Rock and a <b>Hard</b> <b>Place</b> by Peter David.|$|E
500|$|They {{were signed}} to Columbia Records in 1972, and {{released}} {{a string of}} gold and platinum albums, beginning with their 1973 eponymous debut album, followed by Get Your Wings in 1974. In 1975, the band broke into the mainstream with the album Toys in the Attic, and their 1976 follow-up Rocks cemented their status as hard rock superstars. Two additional albums followed in 1977 and 1979. Their first five albums have since attained multi-platinum status. Throughout the 1970s, the band toured extensively and charted a dozen Hot 100 singles. By {{the end of the}} decade, they were among the most popular hard rock bands in the world and developed a loyal following of fans, {{often referred to as the}} [...] "Blue Army". However, drug addiction and internal conflict took their toll on the band, which led to the departures of Perry and Whitford in 1979 and 1981, respectively; they were replaced by Jimmy Crespo and Rick Dufay. The band did not fare well between 1980 and 1984, releasing the album Rock in a <b>Hard</b> <b>Place,</b> which was certified gold but failed to match their previous successes.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1980, Tyler was injured in a {{motorcycle}} crash that left him hospitalized for two months, and unable to tour or record for much of 1981.

Brad Whitford had left in 1981, shortly after recording the guitar parts for the album's lead single, [...] "Lightning Strikes". Whitford was replaced by Rick Dufay, and the band continued to tour into 1983. As the 1980s decade wore on, Tyler's drug abuse increased.
