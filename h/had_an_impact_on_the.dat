According to the food journalist Joanna Blythman, she [...] "performed both a cultural and gastronomic miracle in post-war Britain by introducing the nation to a vision of fresh Continental food", while the writer Rose Prince considers that David [...] "changed for ever the way British people cook". Janet Floyd, professor of American Literature at King's College London, considers that David was not a driver of change, but came to epitomise that change. The literary historian Nicola Humble observes that [...] "the food revolution of the post-war years would probably have happened without Elizabeth David, though in her absence it would have happened very differently".|$|E

2500|$|Throughout history, the {{clothing}} styles in Poland often varied due to foreign influence, {{especially from the}} neighbouring countries and the Middle East. Because of its geographical position, Poland was metaphorically {{referred to as a}} trade route that linked Western Europe with the Ottoman Empire, Crimean Khanate and Persia. This allowed the Poles to absorb several habits, which were present in the Middle East at the time. The high-class nobility and magnates wore attire that somewhat resembled oriental styles. The outfits included a Żupan, Delia, Kontusz, and a type of sword called Karabela, brought by Armenian merchants. Wealthy Polish aristocrats also kept captive Tatars and Janissaries in their courts; this <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> national dress.

2500|$|Willow Bunch is the Rural Municipality #42 in {{southern}} Saskatchewan. In 2006, the total Aboriginal population for the RM #42 was 407. The Métis in Willow Bunch “played {{a key role}} in maintaining the peace during the time that the Sioux and the other American tribes were forced from the United States into the area of Wood Mountain. ” The Métis had a strong relationship with the Sioux, especially with Chief Sitting Bull. “The fires of 1880 on Wood Mountain resulted in the movement of our people to other communities. It was at this time that the Métis pioneers moved to Willow Bunch at the suggestion of Andre Gaudry."
