25|$|From spring 2007 {{through the}} spring of 2009, new {{recruits}} could earn money through sign on bonuses ranging from $5,000 to $10,000. Those bonuses ended in 2009. Sign on bonuses were paid 1/2 after graduation from the academy, and 1/2 after completion of probation. Also, $2,000 could be added for sign ons from outside the Los Angeles area for <b>housing</b> <b>arrangements.</b> As of July 2009, new recruits earned starting salaries of $56,522–$61,095 depending on education level, and began earning their full salary on their first day of academy training.|$|E
500|$|In Ireland, {{the basis}} for social {{organisation}} was the [...] "sept", a clan that could comprise as many as 250 households, or 1250 individuals, all somehow related. In Viking-age Scandinavia, <b>housing</b> <b>arrangements</b> were more humble than those of contemporary France or England, but also here the greater lords would own grand halls wherein they might entertain large numbers of guests.|$|E
50|$|The {{novel is}} an {{indictment}} of the mores of the bourgeoisie of the Second French Empire. It {{is set in a}} Parisian apartment building, a relatively new <b>housing</b> <b>arrangement</b> at the time and its title (roughly translating as stew pot) reflects the disparate and sometimes unpleasant elements lurking behind the building's new façade.|$|R
40|$|This short chapter {{explains}} how {{a growing number}} of theatres are beginning to offer families living with autism and other disabilities opportunities to attend without fear of alienation or rejection by other audience members. Using one small theatre as a case study, the chapter illustrates the sort of adaptations that are made to the performance and front of <b>house</b> <b>arrangements...</b>|$|R
50|$|In October 1957, Fr Paschang {{insisted on}} leaving hospital, and {{returned}} to the Maryknoll Stanley <b>House.</b> <b>Arrangements</b> were made there after a meeting with the visiting Superior General, Father John Comber, and a storeroom on the ground floor next to the kitchen was transformed into a “suite” for him. He was in the tender, if non-professional, care of faithful houseboy Ah Fung.|$|R
500|$|Presidents' Row is {{a cluster}} of ten {{buildings}} {{in the center of}} campus, with each named after a former President of the United States: Adams, Buchanan, Cleveland, Fillmore, Grant, Harrison, Jefferson, Lincoln, Monroe, and Washington. [...] Each unit contains a lounge, meeting rooms, and living areas for up to 35 students. [...] Some rooms are air-conditioned. [...] In addition to standard co-educational living arrangements, Presidents' Row is also home to various theme <b>housing</b> <b>arrangements,</b> including the [...] "Pet House," [...] the Service Leadership House, and the WashPa Radio House. [...] Built in 1968, they were originally called the Residential Center, then The Quads. [...] Fraternities, and then sororities after 1970, were early occupants. [...] In the fall of 2005, these organizations were moved to Chestnut Street housing.|$|E
2500|$|Housing {{units in}} prisons that house {{more than the}} one or two inmates {{normally}} held in cells are referred to as [...] "dormitories" [...] as well. <b>Housing</b> <b>arrangements</b> can vary widely. [...] In some cases, dormitories in low-security prisons may almost resemble their academic counterparts, with the obvious differences of being locked at night, being administered by jailers, and subject to stricter institutional rules and fewer amenities. In other institutions, dormitories may be large rooms, often converted from other purposes such as gymnasiums in response to overcrowding, in which hundreds of prisoners have bunks and lockers.|$|E
2500|$|During the 2010 Olympics, Weir {{became the}} center of an animal rights {{controversy}} by wearing fox fur on his skating costume at that event. He received attacks from the animal rights groups Friends of Animals and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). When the protests escalated to threats of violence against him, Weir announced he would remove the fur from his costume, although he continued to defend wearing fur as a [...] "personal choice," [...] later noting that the activists managed to overlook the fact that all ice skaters wore leather boots. Threats from animal rights activists also forced Weir to alter his <b>housing</b> <b>arrangements</b> for the Olympics in Vancouver. He had intended to stay in a Vancouver hotel, but for security reasons, chose to stay at the secure Olympic Village, sharing a suite with fellow American figure skater Tanith Belbin.|$|E
50|$|A {{condition}} of {{the consent of the}} Lord Chancellor to this proposal was that Newport should provide Judges Lodgings, and this was the reason for the purchase of the Mansion <b>House.</b> <b>Arrangements</b> were made {{at the time of the}} purchase of the Mansion House for it to be used by the Mayor during the times in which it was not required by the Judges.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model of}} an unregulated banking system based around a private clearing <b>house</b> <b>arrangement.</b> Whilst such a system may dominate one with a public safety net in reducing moral hazard in lending and therefore the scope for individual bank insolvency, it also {{increases the likelihood of}} contagious bank failures following a systemic shock or an aggregate liquidity shortage.

60|$|It may be {{imagined}} that Miss Stanbury of the Close {{did not receive}} with equanimity the reports which reached her. And, of course, when she discussed the matter either with Martha or with Dorothy, she fell back upon her own early appreciation of the folly of the Clock <b>House</b> <b>arrangement.</b> Nevertheless, she had called Mrs. Ellison very bad names, when she learned from her friend Mrs. MacHugh what reports were being spread by the lady from Lessboro'.|$|R

5000|$|Sophomore {{students}} are offered suite-style housing, {{in which two}} double rooms share a shower and toilet, with each room having its own sink. Sophomore housing is air conditioned. All of the buildings have kitchens. Each building has washers and dryers {{on the first floor}} for student use as well as light housekeeping services provided to all rooms and bathrooms. The three buildings are located together in a cluster on the university’s campus to replicate the close <b>housing</b> <b>arrangement</b> experienced by first-year residential students.|$|R
50|$|For large gatherings, these {{partitions}} {{are removed}} {{to create one}} large meeting room. During a normal day, partitions can create much smaller and more manageable living spaces. Therefore, kitchen, bathroom, toilet, and genkan with one multipurpose living space create one complete Japanese housing unit. However, the bathroom, toilet, and even kitchen can be communal. (See Sentō.) Therefore, the minimum Japanese <b>housing</b> <b>arrangement,</b> which is still possible to find if one is looking for the cheapest room to rent, consists of just genkan and one living room/space.|$|R

40|$|At {{the request}} of library administration, an {{investigation}} was undertaken to assess {{the status of the}} current federal depository program, OSU Libraries' history with the program, advantages and disadvantages of OSU's continued participation supported by evidence of document usage (both circulated and in-house use) in the last 3 - 5 years, the impact of the selective <b>housing</b> <b>arrangement</b> with the Oregon State Library (the regional library) and other partners, and review of decisions made by some other academic libraries to either remain with the program or to withdraw from it...|$|R

50|$|The Zilverparkkade was {{conceptualized}} by Adriaan Geuze of {{the urban}} planning and landscaping bureau West 8, who envisaged it as a mixed development of both office and residential use, with 10 narrow plots for separate buildings of differing height. Every building was designed by a different architect, resulting in a striking postmodernist lineup of facades. The concept {{of a number of}} different narrow, tall facades mirrors the historic canal <b>house</b> <b>arrangement</b> typical of many Dutch cities. Due to its modern and tall appearance, it is also compared to arrangements such as the Vlissingen seaside boulevard.|$|R
50|$|Pyrton Vicarage is a lath {{and plaster}} {{house that was}} built before 1637. The present brick-built south front was added late in the 18th century. By 1635 Pyrton had also a {{substantial}} rectory, but by 1777 it was a ruin and {{towards the end of}} the 18th century it was demolished. The present Georgian rectory was built in its place and completed in 1788. From about 1885 this Rectory was used to house successive vicars of the adjacent Shirburn parish. In 1943 the two benefices were merged, bringing this unusual <b>housing</b> <b>arrangement</b> to an end.|$|R

50|$|The first {{contemporary}} housing {{was built}} in the area during the 1970s.

50|$|A major {{political}} obstacle to implementing the philanthropists' solitary program in England was financial: Building individual cells for each prisoner {{cost more than}} the congregate <b>housing</b> <b>arrangements</b> typical of eighteenth-century English jails.

50|$|Third-party {{providers}} are private companies and organizations that sponsor study abroad programs.

60|$|Among places, {{apart from}} soldiers', visited lately (December 7) I must {{specially}} mention the great Brooklyn general hospital {{and other public}} institutions at Flatbush, including the extensive lunatic asylum, under charge of Drs.

Clym's intention was to live there alone until Eustacia should join him on their wedding day.|$|R
