These results indicate that steady level-flight transition and descending flight-path angles up to 7 or 8 deg. out of the region of ground effect can be accomplished without wing stall being encountered. In general, the pitching moments out of ground proximity can be adequately trimmed by programming the stabilizer incidence to increase with increasing flap deflection, except for a relatively large <b>diving</b> <b>moment</b> in the hovering condition.

40|$|This report {{gives the}} results of tests on a {{rectangular}} wing model with a 20 % full spun split flap, conducted on the whirling arm at the Daniel Guggenheim Airship Institute in Akron, Ohio. The effect of a ground board on the lift and pitching moment was measured. The ground board consisted of an inclined ramp rising up in the test channel to a level floor extending for some distance parallel to the model path. The path of the wing model {{with respect to the}} ground board accordingly represented with comparative exactness an airplane coming in for a landing. The ground clearances over the level portion of the board varied from 0 6 to 1, 6 chord lengths. Results are given in the standard dimensionless coefficients plotted versus angle of attack for a particular ground clearance. The effect of the ground board is to increase the lift coefficient for a given angle of attack {{all the way up the}} stall. The magnitude of the increase varies both with the ground clearance and the angle of attack. The effect on the pitching moment coefficient is not so readily apparent due to experimental difficulties but, in general, the <b>diving</b> <b>moment</b> increases over the ground board. This effect is apparent principally at the high angles of attack. An exception to this effect occurs with flaps deflected at the lowest ground clearance (0. 6 chords).

40|$|An {{exploratory}} wind-tunnel {{investigation has}} been made to determine the lift effects of blowing from nacelles over the upper surface of flaps on a model having a delta wing of aspect ratio 3. Several flap conditions were examined. High-pressure air was blown from an external-pipe arrangement supported above the wing to simulate jet-engine exhaust. The jet momentum- coefficient range was from 0 to 3. 0 and the model angle of attack was 0 deg. The results of this limited investigation show that values of jet circulation lift coefficient larger than the Jet reaction were produced with blowing over flaps from nacelles mounted above the wing. 'I!heuse of double slotted flaps with the gap unsealed between the flaps and wing had a large detrimental effect on the lift capabilities.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results obtained from pressure distribution tests on the fuselage of a PW- 9 pursuit airplane {{in a number of}} conditions of flight. The investigation was made to determine the contribution of the fuselage to the total lift in conditions considered critical for the wing structure, and also to determine whether the fuselage loads acting simultaneously with the maximum tail loads were of such a character as to be of concern with respect to the structural design of other parts of the airplane. The results show that the contribution of the fuselage toward the total lift is small on this airplane. Aerodynamic loads on the fuselage are, in general, unimportant from the structural viewpoint, and in most cases they are of such character that, if neglected, a conservative design results.

40|$|The {{effects of}} ice {{formations}} on the section lift, drag, and pitching-moment coefficients of an unswept NACA 65 A 004 airfoil section of 6 -foot chord were studied [...] The {{magnitude of the}} aerodynamic penalties was primarily {{a function of the}} shape and size of the ice formation near {{the leading edge of the}} airfoil. The exact size and shape of the ice formations were determined photographically and found to be complex functions of the operating and icing conditions. In general, icing of the airfoil at angles of attack less than 40 caused large increases in section drag coefficients (as much as 350 percent in 8 minutes of heavy glaze icing), reductions in section lift coefficients (up to 13 percent), and changes in the pitching-moment coefficient from <b>diving</b> toward climbing <b>moments.</b> At angles of attack greater than 40 the aerodynamic characteristics depended mainly on the ice type. The section drag coefficients generally were reduced by the addition of rime ice (by as much as 45 percent in 8 minutes of icing). In glaze icing, however, the drag increased at these angles of attack. The section lift coefficients were variably affected by rime-ice formations; however, in glaze icing, lift increases at high angles of attack amounted to as much as 9 percent for an icing time of 8 minutes. Pitching-moment-coefficient changes in icing conditions were somewhat erratic and depended on the icing condition. Rotation of the iced airfoil to angles of attack other than that at which icing occurred caused sufficiently large changes in the pitching-moment coefficient that, in flight, rapid corrections in trim might be required in order to avoid a hazardous situation...|$|R

40|$|In {{spite of}} {{sophisticated}} diving equipment and excellent offers of education every year {{a lot of}} SCUBA-divers in Germany and abroad die on their holiday trips. In most cases the reason for dying is certified by autopsy. But the events during the last min-utes of life remain uncertain. For this reason this study with the name PROTOIS-PROJEKT intended to find an an-swer to the following questions: What is {{the reaction of the}} autonomic-nervous-system to SCUBA-diving at a dept of 44 meters ?	 Is there an correlation between arterial catecholamine concentration and heart-rate-variability ? Is the activity of the autonomic-nervous-system a measure of the fitness for <b>diving</b> at this <b>moment</b> ? And can it be used to indicate a beginning panic-process ? To minimize every risk for the divers all SCUBA-diving was done in the deep-diving-simulator called TAUCHTURM-Berlin. In and around the TAUCHTURM many techni-cal modifications had to be performed for this special kind of SCUBA-diving. During the SCUBA-diving the influences of breathing-gas, dept and submersion were separated for the intention to relate effects unambiguous to their causes. The diving profile with air as a breathing-gas consisted of two submersion periods, one in a dept of 2 meters, another in the dept of 44 meters. Each of them lasted 15 minutes. Fur-thermore one SCUBA-diving with oxygen as breathing-gas and one with heliox 21 as breathing-gas were performed in a congruent way. For {{the first time in history}} during SCUBA-diving arterial blood-samples were taken at a dept of 44 meters. Examinations like this could not be found in scientific literature. The results show significant decreases of Noradrenalin und Adrenalin concentration in plasma. The control values before diving were compared to the data at the end of both submersions, when the divers were for more than 10 minutes under water. The concentration of Noradrenalin decreases almost 30 Procent, the concentration of Adrenalin about 40 Prozent. The dept of water seems to make no difference to the effect. A corresponding effect can be found in part of the heart-rate-variability pa-rameters.

40|$|Basic Notes: This talk {{introduces}} an idea, a thought, nascent {{plans and}} potential methodologies for {{a form of}} undergraduate research training – and a potential research project. A project that will highlight connective and investigative questioning that compliments and expands on the ACRL Framework but does so through a refocus on research philosophies found within the humanities. It strikes me, of course, that we are, all of us lightening-ers discussing how to exist and thrive in an information rich world, not in the post-information dystopia we’re entering in January, but maybe the next generation will have better training…maybe. What is humanistic thinking? It is many things, but crucially for this context it is a mode of questioning and of developing thoughtful and thought out research questions. Questions formulated, As Bertrand Russell writes, “not carelessly and dogmatically, as we do in ordinary life {{and even in the}} sciences, but critically. ” This is the crucial difference. The hope is to help students engage with ideas {{in a way that they}} may not be doing in their normal class, or put another way, that their professors think and expect they’re doing, but which they might not fully understand. As we work with the Framework to evolve what it is we’re seeking to teach with information literacy, and as we continue to adapt that concept, the ability to engage is more relevant than ever, perhaps. In my experience teaching first year and eng comprehensive information literacy sessions, it has become clear that students are not thinking about their research process in any clear or defined way. This is, of course, partially just out of their age and position in their education, but there are also larger issues at play. This is not the place to rant about the state of K- 12 education and the myopic focus on STEM above all else, but I will. Kidding. Sort of. The problem is that students are not being given the keys to their own brains and the avenues of their own creativity of thought. This method, could, potentially help with that and in turn help to develop more interesting scholars. At UMD our school motto is “beat Michigan” (not likely), I mean, “fearless ideas” and hopefully by allowing students some space to evolve their ideas we can get closer to this ideal What is critical theory thinking? This is the larger question, really. How can I translate a humanistic approach into something tangible and practical. Slowly, is the answer. Incrementally Let’s unpack the crucial tool in this if there is one: Epistemology. This can get out of hand quickly. Some applications of epistemology seek to understand the very nature of knowledge and the ability of actually knowing. That is too deep a <b>dive</b> at the <b>moment.</b> What we’re concerned with is the lineage of knowledge and basing ideas and new theories on the backs of established studies. To help students make the connections of ideas, to learn from their reading and thus draw meaningful and rationally correct conclusions not from a priori assumption, but as a logical extension of the extant body of thought. This is important not simply in a humanities class, and this is my probably only solid point, that this is an important facet of all disciplines, expressed in different ways, but is an expectation of professors as a result of graduate training and professional scholarship. This is not always explained to students. Perhaps we can explain it to them. The ACRL Framework goes some distance with this idea with the frames “Scholarship as Conversation” and “Research as Inquiry” most pointedly, and it pops up here and there throughout others as well. “Scholarship as Conversation” speaks specifically of the discursive nature of research, but doesn’t go far enough into the methods of thought and the value of the modes of knowledge and the weight that a particular form of knowledge carries being either immense or zero. When I say Foucault, Shakespeare, Joanne Rowling, Edward Said, whoever – there is a body of work behind them that, in the case of these authors, represents an immense system. This is both the same and not the same as Jones & Smith (2013) in the Journal of Microconductors. The point is, there is a weight, a conversation, a discursivity of authorial authority that is important for students to understand. Students, in my observation, have difficulty with synthesizing an author’s ideas, or seeing the connective tissue. It is perhaps the nature and the modes by which this discourse is discovered and reflected upon that is the missing gap, perhaps, between the Framework – which tends to focus more on the mechanics of citation and attribution as opposed to idea connection – and the course and/ or deeper research. What: The idea is to introduce research as a more fully flushed out discipline, to effectively mark out the process and to purposely problematize elements of the traditional a-b-c research process. In other words, making the Research Cycle a philosophical exercise by teaching critical theory and a form of epistemology as a method of research questioning and thesis development by emphasizing particular avenues of thought and elaborating on them somewhat. What this isn’t: I don’t want to give the impression that my ideal IL session is a philosophy lesson…well, okay, actually it is, but I know that’s not a realistic option. So I’m not really advocating for starting a class with a dense passage from Heidegger, or even the quote I used earlier from Russell, nor am I advocating that words like epistemology, social capital, feminism (gasp) or marxism (double gasp) come from non-tenured librarians, but the hope is to USE these models, adapted for IL instruction as a way to help students THINK about their research as opposed to simply performing it. To make connections and to think deeply about the constructs informing belief. How?: Focusing on at least 2 key ideas: critical questioning and epistemology. This model, when finalized will attempt to fit into the already crowded and admittedly outdated space of people like McKenzie, Kuhlthau, etc. What will, I believe, differentiate this project from others is the emphasis on research as a separate discipline – one based on principles of humanist thinking in an effort to pull both rigor and creativity from the students as opposed to simply finding papers to cite – to, hopefully, get the students to engage in a more interesting way with the material they’re finding and to USE it. The hope to is to expand on these models as a simple adjustment to a more Framework based model. The Framework allows deeper thinking and getting outside the checkbox model of “things to do when researching,” but doesn’t go quite far enough. The major step that I’ve taken in this direction is to work with students to explain their thought process as they answer my questions in a session. As I mentioned at the top, we are now in a different world and the value of information either means much more or much less. By giving students, esp. non-humanities students, the keys to their brains, we can help unlock potential for a new generation of ethically minded, global students with more interest in investigating the set cultural assumptions...|$|R
