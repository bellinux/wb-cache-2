40|$|In many {{fretting}} investigations, tribochemical reactions {{have been}} reported to critically determine the wear and friction behavior, however, different and contradictory assessments of the importance of mechanical and thermal effects on these reactions have been suggested. Since fretting is characterized by relatively slow sliding speeds, high temperatures are not generated over the entire nominal contact area. However, evidence for phase transformations, which are typical of high temperatures, have been observed many times in fretting experiments. In other words, there exists a discrepancy between the macroscale and microscale observations. In our previous experimental and theoretical work, the tribochemical transformations of steel and ceramics were extensively investigated and the presence of very high <b>flash</b> <b>contact</b> temperatures under gross slip fretting was confirmed. In this paper we present a tentative explanation of the mechanism for the observed tribochemical changes under selected fretting conditions, which can also explain the discrepancy in the results from macroscale and microscale studies. The proposed wear mechanism considers the tribochemical transformations at the asperity spot-to-spot contacts due to high flash temperatures, while the heat generation and dissipation at apparent contact area remain significantly lower. The observed overall wear transition occurs due to gradual accumulation of the transformed material, which in "closed" fretting contacts remains in great part within the contact...|$|R

Batman doesn't care about crime outside Gotham City and has his successful casinos fund his seemingly fruitless fight on crime. Despite his cynical outlook, Batman reluctantly assist Barry Allen with a device to recreate the accident behind Barry's powers as the Flash. After the first attempt fails and the second attempt restores Barry's powers, Batman and <b>Flash</b> <b>contact</b> Cyborg for help in tracking down the government branch that hid the frail Kal-El.

50|$|A typical {{electronic}} {{flash unit}} has electronic circuitry to charge a high-capacity capacitor to several hundred volts. When the flash is triggered by the shutter's <b>flash</b> synchronization <b>contact,</b> the capacitor is discharged almost instantaneously through a flash tube, producing a flash of very brief duration almost instantaneously (i.e., the flash duration, often around 1/1000 of a second, is shorter than most practical shutter speeds, and full brightness is reached before the shutter has time to close appreciably). Synchronization of full flash brightness with maximum shutter opening was problematic with bulbs which took an appreciable time to ignite and reach full brightness; electronic flash does not have these difficulties.|$|R
40|$|The {{superior}} {{high temperature}} resistance of silicon nitride (Si 3 N 4) based ceramics makes them suitable for tribological applications above room temperature or in high speed unlubricated sliding. There are some published {{works on the}} wear behaviour of Si 3 N 4 /metal alloys. However, experimental data are shown {{in a form that}} is not of direct use for engineers involved in materials selection. In the present work, Si 3 N 4 pins were tested against tool steel and grey cast iron on a pin-on-disc tribometer. Ceramics were produced by hot-pressing and tested without lubrication at variable temperature and sliding speed. SEM/EDS and XRD analysis were used for chemical and microstructural characterisation of worn surfaces and wear debris. At low speeds (0. 05 - 0. 5 m s-I) and room temperature, Si 3 N 4 surfaces are polished-like due to a combination of humidity-assisted tribo-oxidation and abrasive action of very fine wear debris. At high sliding speeds (2 - 3. 5 m S-I), as well as for temperatures in the range 400 - 600 °C, an extensive coherent tribolayer mainly composed by iron oxides spreads over the ceramic surfaces. Polishing and protection by adherent tribolayers are the mechanisms responsible for observed severe and mild wear regimes, respectively. Wear maps are constructed showing the transition of wear regimes in Si 3 N 4 /iron alloys contacts determined by constant flash temperature curves. Equations for calculation of bulk and <b>flash</b> <b>contact</b> temperatures in tribocontacts between dissimilar materials are deduced...|$|R

The already established international standard was 36 images of 24×36mm. By doing so, a standard length of film yielded four more exposures on a 36-exposure load. The Minolta-35 has a combined viewfinder and rangefinder eyepiece, negating the need to move the sight from one window to the other. It also features a self-timer and a hinged rear door to facilitate film loading. The camera came with a decent Super Rokkor 45mm f/2.8 standard optic comprising five elements in three groups, including the front group of three cemented elements designed to secure sharp images on the small negative. When the camera appeared all engravings on the lens and on the slow-speed dial were oriented to be read from the front side of the camera. Later, at about serial no. 4000, they were turned to be read as one holds the camera for picture taking.

40|$|Abstract—A difficult-to-predict {{electrical}} failure is the continu-ity failure. Pressure junctions are common problem sources for continuity failures. Available tools {{to search for}} pressure-junction problems include low-resistance testing, temperature monitoring using physical contact between sensor and heated part, pyrom-eter temperature monitoring, infrared photography, and visual inspection. While each method is effective, each of these methods has one or more disadvantages. This paper will describe a break-through patented method of directly calculating conductor and pressure-junction impedance, resistance, and reactance using the noisy harmonic-laden switching-transient-laced (in other words, normal) load current flowing through an electrical distribution system. This technique then provides {{the solution to the}} problem of how to detect a conductor-path-impedance change of only a few tens of micro-ohms using conventional protective and metering devices without the need to de-energize the equipment or without the need to inject currents.

On 7 January 1945, Picuda {{received}} a contact report from Barb and closed a convoy in the straits of Formosa to inflict severe damage with four torpedo hits on 10,045-ton tanker Munakata Maru. On the afternoon of 8 January, she again received a convoy contact report from Barb and slipped between two escorts of the starboard screen about four hours before midnight to pick out two large passenger-freighters. Three bow tubes fired at each target resulted in one hit on each. She swung and fired stern shots at a tanker, then discovered an escort dead ahead, 700 yd range, and was forced to clear the area. The 2854-ton coastal tanker Hikoshima Maru, hit by both Picuda and Barb, was disabled and ran aground. The freighter Meiho Maru had a similar experience, and severe damage was inflicted on 6600-ton freighter Hisagawa Maru as well as 6516-ton coastal tanker Manju Maru. Picuda having <b>flashed</b> a <b>contact</b> report as she cleared the area, set course for lifeguard station in support of the Third Fleet airstrikes on Formosa.

Hitherto, the sedimentary rocks {{were considered to be}} Mid Tonian based on Rb–Sr illite and glauconite geochronology of the Atar Group. However, new Re–Os organic-rich sediment (ORS) geochronology from two drill cores indicates that the Proterozoic Atar Group is 200 Ma older (1107 ± 12 Ma, 1109 ± 22 Ma and 1105 ± 37 Ma). The Re–Os geochronology suggests that the Rb–Sr geochronology records the age of diagenetic events possibly associated with the Pan African collision. The new Re–Os geochronology data provide absolute age constraints for recent carbon isotope chemostratigraphy which suggests that the Atar Group is Mesoproterozoic and not Neoproterozoic. The new Re–Os ORS geochronology supports previous studies that suggest that rapid hydrocarbon generation (<b>flash</b> pyrolysis) from <b>contact</b> metamorphism of a dolerite sill does not significantly disturb the Re–Os ORS systematics.

In addition, the Re–Os depositional ages for the ORS of the Taoudeni basin are comparable to those of ORS from the São Francisco craton, suggesting that these cratons are correlatable.
