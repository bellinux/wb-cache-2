40|$|Once an {{installed}} {{strain gage}} {{is connected to}} a strain <b>indicating</b> <b>device</b> and the instrument is balanced, a subsequent change in temperature of the gage installation will generally produce a resistance change in the gage. This purely temperature-induced resistance will be registered by the <b>indicating</b> <b>device</b> as a strain and {{is referred to as}} 'apparent strain' to distinguish it from strain due to applied stress. One desirable technique for apparent strain compensation is to employ two identical gages with identical mounting procedures which are connected with a 'half bridge' configuration where gages see the same thermal environment but only one experiences a mechanical strain input. Their connection in adjacent arms of the bridge will then balance the thermally induced apparent strains and, in principle, only the mechanical strain remains.

40|$|Despite {{the wealth}} of {{literature}} generated {{over the past two}} decades on the apology as a speech act, the political apology has been relatively neglected as a research topic. This article aims to examine the pragmatics of such apologies as a generic type of discourse by identifying their salient characteristics: they are in the public domain and highly mediated; they are generated by (and generate) conflict and controversy; on the basis of media and viewer evaluations/judgements, they need to contain both an illocutionary force <b>indicating</b> <b>device</b> (Ifid) and an explicit expression of the acceptance of responsibility/blame for the ‘offence’ in order to be clearly perceived as valid apologies; and they rarely, if ever, involve an expression of absolution. Drawing primarily on data concerning recent political events in the UK (especially the Iraq War), the article attempts to set out and illustrate the different types of political apology. The resulting analysis is related both to previous and current apology research and to recent developments in politeness theory. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{wide range}} of direct {{pressure}} measuring electromechanical transducers is now commercially available in the market. In such electromechanical type direct <b>indicating</b> <b>devices,</b> the applied pressure is directly measured by a sensing element with a suitable mechanism into an analog / digital electrical signal in terms of voltage, current or frequency. The generation of such signals is based upon some electromechanical effects viz. inductive, capacitive, resistive, piezoelectric, piezoresistive, reluctive, resonative and optoelectric etc. A {{wide range of}} such pressure measuring instruments is now commercially available in the market. The high-pressure technology and new applications demand that the best instrumentation should ensure the lowest measurement uncertainty, particularly in the fluid media. The calculation of the calibration results and associated uncertainties is a complex matter involving many influencing quantities. The present paper describes a novel method for evaluating uncertainty in pressure measurement using electromechanical type direct pressure <b>indicating</b> <b>devices</b> through statistical analysis of errors. The method of evaluation of associated uncertainties {{is in line with}} ISO and EA Guidelines on the evaluation and expression of uncertainty in measurement. The results thus obtained are compared with the results obtained by using standard technique described in EA guidelines. Both the methods are quite comparable...|$|R

The Intrinsic TID Program encompasses both Special Nuclear Material (SNM) and Nuclear Material (NM) items that have intrinsic characteristics that would immediately indicate tampering upon visual inspection.

Under the program, an identified intrinsic item receives the same safeguards credits as other tamper-sealed items already in the TID Program. The major benefits of the Intrinsic TID Program include reducing verification measurements on intrinsically identified inventory items and reducing exposure to operators working in highly irradiated environments. Intrinsic TIDs should be combined with other safeguards requirements, and items should have defensible measurements as well as visual inspections.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to see whether gender plays a role in the apology {{strategies}} employed by native speakers of Arabic, i. e., how Arab males and females express apologies in different situations. Data necessary for this study were collected via a Discourse Completion Task (DCT) questionnaire, incorporating 10 real-life scenarios in the form of short descriptive statements. In accordance with the Cross-Cultural Speech Act Realisation Patterns, participants’ responses(n = 20) were analysed and further classified into five distinct apology strategies: (Illocutionary Force <b>Indicating</b> <b>Device</b> (IFID), Responsibility (RESP), Explanation (EXPL), Repair (REPR), and Forbearance (FORB)). The researcher initially hypothesised that apology strategies employed by participants would exhibit more differences than similarities among native speakers of Arabic. Contrary to previously conducted research on this subject (i. e., attesting more differences), the data analysed (n = 350 apology exchanges) revealed more similarities than differences regardless of gender. In fact, no statistically significant differences were found. In addition to contributing to the current theoretical debate on gender and gender-related topics, the results of this study may entail pedagogical implications for those in direct contact with Arab learners of English as a Second Language or with speakers of Arabic in general terms...|$|E
