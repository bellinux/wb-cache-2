5|$|About 100 {{separate}} {{stations for}} box huckleberry {{have been documented}} in the scientific literature. By the time of Baird's collection in 1845, the West Virginia stations of the plant had been lost to science, and his Pennsylvania colony {{was the only one}} <b>known</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> time. Specimens of box huckleberry were subsequently identified in Delaware in 1870, by William M. Canby.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the filmmakers}} put {{considerable}} effort into historical accuracy, particularly in details, {{the film is}} <b>known</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> key distortions of history. An entirely fictional sequence was added in which Truman agonizes over whether to authorize the attack; anti-aircraft shells are shown bursting around the Enola Gay on its bombing run over Hiroshima; and {{it is said that}} leaflets were dropped on Hiroshima for ten days in advance of the mission warning the citizens of the forthcoming raid. The film received generally mixed reviews, and was a box office disappointment.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} <b>known</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> time that St Kilda was {{continuously}} inhabited for two millennia or more, from the Bronze Age to the 20th century. Recently, the first direct evidence of earlier Neolithic settlement emerged—shards of pottery of the Hebridean ware style, found {{to the east}} of the village. The subsequent discovery of a quarry for stone tools on Mullach Sgar above Village Bay led to finds of numerous stone hoe-blades, grinders and Skaill knives in the Village Bay cleitean—unique stone storage buildings (see below). These tools are also probably of Neolithic origin.|$|E

5|$|The {{level of}} secrecy of the case, which was criticised by some {{contemporary}} observers, {{meant that it}} was not properly recorded or published, and the exact facts of the argument were not <b>known</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> time. As a result, whilst it sharply differs from later rulings such as Corbett v Corbett , it was not able to be considered as precedent in later judgments on the legal recognition of gender variance.|$|E
5|$|A narrow quay passes {{under the}} old swivel section of the bridge from Waller's Quay to the marina. A well-worn {{handrail}} offers the pedestrian some protection against a slip into the river. This rail has been known as the Duke's Rail since in 1897 the then Duke of York, later to become George V, paid a state visit to Ireland. The royal party travelled up-river from Portumna on the steamship Countess of Mayo. Disembarking at Waller's Quay, the Duke was received by Lord Rosse, the Lord Lieutenant of King's County. The party had to traverse the narrow quay under the bridge to get to Banagher Railway Station, and undoubtedly made good use of the Duke's Rail. The stretch of the Shannon from Portumna to Banagher was <b>known</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> time after as the Duke of York's Route.|$|E
5|$|Further {{evidence}} {{for the existence of}} the Kuiper belt later emerged from the study of comets. That comets have finite lifespans has been <b>known</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> time. As they approach the Sun, its heat causes their volatile surfaces to sublimate into space, gradually dispersing them. In order for comets to continue to be visible over the age of the Solar System, they must be replenished frequently. One such area of replenishment is the Oort cloud, a spherical swarm of comets extending beyond 50,000 AU from the Sun first hypothesised by Dutch astronomer Jan Oort in 1950. The Oort cloud is thought to be the point of origin of long-period comets, which are those, like Hale–Bopp, with orbits lasting thousands of years.|$|E

5|$|Physical {{limitations}} of computer hardware aside, in principle {{it is possible}} to solve any game under the condition that the complete state is known and there is no random chance. Strong solutions, i.e. algorithms that can produce perfect play from any position, are <b>known</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> simple games such as Tic Tac Toe/Noughts and crosses (draw with perfect play) and Connect Four (first player wins). Weak solutions exist for somewhat more complex games, such as checkers (with perfect play on both sides the game is known to be a draw, but it is not known for every position created by less-than-perfect play what the perfect next move would be). Other games, such as chess (from the starting position) and Go, have not been solved because their game complexity is too vast for computers to evaluate all possible positions. To reduce the game complexity, researchers have modified these complex games by reducing the size of the board, or the number of pieces, or both.|$|E

25|$|The Return of Dracula (1958) {{brought the}} Count to modern day America. Matinee idol Francis Lederer played Dracula, who flees vampire hunters in Transylvania {{to take up}} {{residence}} in small-town America in the guise of an artist he had previously murdered. The Count begins to feed on the local populace and create more vampires before he is tracked to his lair in an abandoned mine and destroyed. Paul Landres directed from a screenplay by Pat Fielder. The film is also <b>known,</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> reason, as The Fantastic Disappearing Man. It has been shown on television under the title The Curse of Dracula.|$|E
25|$|Tito died on 4 May 1980 of {{complications}} from surgery. While it had been <b>known</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> time that the 87-year-old president's health had been failing, his death nonetheless {{came as a shock}} to the country. This was because Tito was looked upon as the country's hero in World War II and had been the country's dominant figure and identity for over three decades. His loss marked a significant alteration, and it was reported that many Yugoslavs openly mourned his death. In the Split soccer stadium, Serbs and Croats visited the coffin among other spontaneous outpourings of grief, and a funeral was organized by the League of Communists.|$|E

Type 2 has been divided into two subtypes - a and b. Deficiency restricted to the platelets alone is known as type 2a; if CD36 is also absent from the erythoblasts the phenotype is classified as type 2b. The molecular basis is <b>known</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> cases: T1264G in both Kenyans and Gambians; C478T (50%), 539 deletion of AC and 1159 insertion of an A, 1438-1449 deletion and a combined 839-841 deletion GAG and insertion of AAAAC in Japanese.|$|E

The Brisbane Bandits is also a reintroduction of a team name from the original ABL that participated in all but the final season.|$|E
25|$|Lastly, on 3 March, Severn {{destroyed}} the American privateer Ino. American accounts report that Ino grounded outside of Charleston on 7 March. As hr crew {{was attempting to}} free Ino, Severn {{came on the scene}} and launched her boats to board Ino. Inos crew, unaware that the war had ended on 15 February 1815, fired grapeshot and small arms at the British boats, causing them to shear off. Ino crew then set fire to her and took to their boats and some improvised rafts. A schooner that came out from Charleston rescued almost all. The Inos crew believed that Captain Nourse of Severn had <b>known</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> days that the war had ended. The delay of payment of the head money may have been due to the need to adjudicate the case.|$|E

25|$|The {{third most}} {{abundant}} constituent of the Uranian atmosphere is methane , {{the presence of}} which has been <b>known</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> time {{as a result of the}} ground-based spectroscopic observations. Methane possesses prominent absorption bands in the visible and near-infrared, making Uranus aquamarine or cyan in colour. Below the methane cloud deck at 1.3bar methane molecules account for about 2.3% of the atmosphere by molar fraction; about 10 to 30 times that found in the Sun. The mixing ratio is much lower in the upper atmosphere due to the extremely low temperature at the tropopause, which lowers the saturation level and causes excess methane to freeze out. Methane appears to be undersaturated in the upper troposphere above the clouds having a partial pressure of only 30% of the saturated vapor pressure there. The concentration of less volatile compounds such as ammonia, water and hydrogen sulfide in the deep atmosphere is poorly known. However, as with methane, their abundances are probably greater than solar values by a factor of at least 20 to 30, and possibly by a factor of a few hundred.|$|E
25|$|In 1399, {{the exiled}} Henry Bolingbroke, {{heir to the}} Duchy of Lancaster, {{returned}} to reclaim his lands. Henry raised an army and marched to meet the King. Richard hurried back from Ireland to Wales to deal with Bolingbroke but he was arrested by Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland, as {{he was on his}} way from Conwy Castle to meet Bolingbroke at Flint Castle supposedly to discuss the restitution of Henry's lands. Richard was imprisoned at Chester before being taken to London. Parliament quickly made Henry Bolingbroke Regent and then King. Richard died in Pontefract Castle, shortly after the failed Epiphany Rising of English nobles in January 1400, but his death was not generally <b>known</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> time. In Wales, people like Owain Glyndŵr were asked for the first time in their life to decide their loyalties. The Welsh had generally supported King Richard, who had succeeded his father, Edward, the Black Prince, as Prince of Wales. With Richard removed, the opportunities for advancement for Welsh people became more limited. Many Welsh people seem to have been uncertain where this left them and their future.|$|E
