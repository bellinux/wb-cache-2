60|$|The {{occasion}} indeed was {{a melancholy}} one, only six weeks having elapsed since that telegram {{had come from}} Scorrier, the mining <b>expert,</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> private <b>mission</b> to the Mines, informing them that Pippin, their Superintendent, had committed suicide in endeavouring, after his extraordinary two years' silence, {{to write a letter}} to his Board. That letter was on the table now; it would be read to the Shareholders, who would of course be put into possession of all the facts.|$|R
40|$|International audienceDuring {{the siege}} of Sardis in 213, Bôlis betrays Sôsibios, {{counsellor}} of Ptolemy IV, and delivers the usurper Achaios to Antiochos III. The traditional image of the Cretan mercenary that has been traditionally attached to him must be qualified. In fact Bôlis was also <b>a</b> military <b>expert,</b> sent <b>on</b> <b>a</b> special <b>mission,</b> {{who knew how to}} analyze the political situation and context. This issue reveals the secret diplomacy of States, its agents and means, and also the official and symbolic expression of the power that shows itself during the punishment of Achaios. In the Greco-Anatolian context, {{it is clear that the}} myth of the silenus Marsyas, punished by Apollo for his hybris, was used by the Seleucid power...|$|R

Although The Quebecers attacked Men <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Mission</b> before the bell, Mabel quickly recovered and clotheslined both Quebecers. The Quebecers used several double-team moves against their opponents, but Mabel reversed the momentum after Pierre missed a senton bomb. Mabel eventually missed an Avalanche, allowing The Quebecers to suplex him. The Quebecers performed <b>an</b> assisted senton <b>on</b> Mabel {{but did not}} get <b>a</b> pinfall. Men <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Mission</b> regained the advantage, prompting The Quebecers' manager, Johnny Polo, to pull his wrestlers out of the ring.
