40|$|Abstract — Detection {{of human}} {{emotions}} has many potential applications. One of application is to quantify attentiveness audience in order evaluate acoustic quality in concern hall. The subjective audio preference {{that based on}} from audience is used. To obtain fairness evaluation of acoustic quality, the research proposed system for multimodal emotion detection; one modality based on brain signals that measured using electroencephalogram (EEG) and the second modality is sequences of facial images. In the experiment, an audio signal was customized which consist of normal and disorder sounds. Furthermore, an audio signal was played in order to stimulate positive/negative emotion feedback of volunteers. EEG signal from temporal lobes, i. e. T 3 and T 4 was used to measured brain response and sequence of facial image was used to monitoring facial expression during volunteer hearing audio signal. On EEG signal, feature was extracted from change information in brain wave, particularly in alpha and beta wave. Feature of facial expression was extracted based on analysis of motion images. We implement an advance optical flow method to detect the most active facial muscle form normal to other emotion expression that represented in vector flow maps. The reduce problem on detection of emotion state, vector flow maps are transformed into compass mapping that represents major directions and velocities of facial movement. The {{results showed that the}} power of beta wave is increasing when disorder sound stimulation was given, however for each volunteer was giving different emotion feedback. Based on features derived from facial face images, an optical <b>flow</b> <b>compass</b> mapping was promising to use as additional information to make decision about emotion feedback...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{debugging}} tools present developers with {{means to}} explore the run-time context in which an error has occurred. In many cases this is enough to help the developer discover the faulty source code and correct it. However, rather often errors occur due to code that has executed in the past, leaving certain objects in an inconsistent state. The actual run-time error only occurs when these inconsistent objects are used later in the program. So-called back-in-time debuggers help developers step back through earlier states {{of the program and}} explore execution contexts not available to conventional debuggers. Nevertheless, even back-in-time debuggers do not help answer the question, ``Where did this object come from?'' The Object-Flow Virtual Machine, which we have proposed in previous work, tracks the flow of objects to answer precisely such questions, but this VM does not provide dedicated debugging support to explore faulty programs. In this paper we present a novel debugger, called Compass, to navigate between conventional run-time stack-oriented control flow views and object <b>flows.</b> <b>Compass</b> enables a developer to effectively navigate from an object contributing to an error back-in-time through all the code that has touched the object. We present the design and implementation of Compass, and we demonstrate how flow-centric, back-in-time debugging can be used to effectively locate the source of hard-to-find bugs...|$|R
40|$|Four {{types of}} {{biomimetic}} sensors {{have been designed}} and simulated for flight control of a robotic flying insect. The ocelli use four photodiodes to detect changes in light intensity in the surrounding. The halteres use piezo-actuated vibrating structures to sense the Coriolis forces to detect angular velocities. The optic flow sensors consist of linear arrays of elementary motion detectors to register optic <b>flows.</b> The MEMS <b>compass</b> uses three metal loops to detect changes in the magnetic field. Despite simplicity and novelty, the preliminary tests on these devices showed promising performances for using such biomimetic sensors on a robotic flying insect. ...|$|R

Time flows, and around me a continuum moves and swirls, engulfing me, and moves majestically beyond my inner sight or imagination. This time is immense, a celestial sphere yet it does not forget me, [...] does not neglect me. It embraces me. I am part of its verity. It {{is a part of}} mine. My life <b>flows.</b> It flows.” <b>Compass</b> is also based on a local Lakota Sioux Native-American story of discovering the four points of a compass. In the story, a bird leads the narrator to four boulders, symbolizing different directions. Hudson includes a depiction of this bird in his northern stone; he uses the copper cutout bird from the Mound City Hopewell Indians of Ohio as a guide. The stainless steel tubes were polished to a mirror-like quality for multiple different reasons: “to incorporate the color and atmosphere of the environment into the work, reflect the movement of passers-by, and to make the stones float, like my Father did with my Mother in their floating ring trick back in the 40s in Wyoming when he was a professional magician named Bendu.” ...|$|R
