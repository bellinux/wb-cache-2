2500|$|Opas in {{defending}} Ryan {{put a lot}} of pressure on a warder who made conflicting statements, Paterson had made several mutually contradictory statements to police about what he saw, heard and did on that day. In his first statement given to Detective Sergeant Carton on 19 December 1965 Paterson said; [...] "I did not hear a shot fired other than the one I fired." [...] In a second statement given to Senior Detective Morrison on 12 January 1966 Paterson said; [...] "Just as I turned into the entrance to the garden I heard a shot." [...] In a third statement on 3 February 1966 Paterson said; [...] "I ran back inside and asked for a gun, I went to the main gate and I received a gun and ran back outside, as I was running on to the lawn I heard the crack of a shot." [...] Paterson changed his story, too, about who was in the line of fire when he aimed his rifle. In his first statement Paterson said; [...] "I sighted my rifle at Ryan and was about to fire when a woman walked into the line of fire and I lifted my rifle." [...] In his second statement Paterson said; [...] "I took aim at Ryan but two prison officers were in the line of fire so I dropped my rifle again." [...] In his third statement Paterson said; [...] "I took aim at Ryan and I found out I had to fire between two prison officers to get Ryan, so <b>I</b> <b>lowered</b> my gun again." ...|$|E
