40|$|Factors {{that also}} affect {{performance}} and reduce {{exhaust gas emissions}} are fuel quality combustion in the combustion chamber. One of the parameters that influence {{is the amount of}} supply of combustion air into the combustion chamber. Where this supply is governed by the camshaft mechanism through open-close of the intake valve and the exhaust valve. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the effect of reduction of lift camshaft on engine performance. The investigation was conducted on a Yamaha jupiter Z 1 single-cylinder, four-stroke, spark ignition engine. The experiments were performed by varying the reduction of lift camshaft, with camshaft standard (CAM STD), camshaft condition 1 with reduction of lift camshaft 0. 5 mm (CAM 1), camshaft condition 2 with reduction of lift camshaft 0. 10 mm (CAM 2) and camshaft condition 3 with reduction of lift camshaft 0. 15 mm (CAM 3) and speed of the engine (2000 rpm, 3000 rpm and 4000 rpm). As a result, the maximum <b>effective</b> <b>braking</b> <b>power</b> was on CAM STD, at the engine speed of 3000 rpm that was 535. 072 Watt, minimum SFC (Specific Fuel Consumption) was on CAM 2, at the engine speed 3000 rpm that was 1. 54 x 10 - 7 kg/J and the thermal of maximum braking efficiency was on the CAM 2, at the engine speed of 3000 rpm equal to 14. 129 %...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to investigate the effect of using unleaded gasoline-ethanol blends on the performance of an unmodified SI engine. A four stroke, four cylinders, water-cooled SI engine (type Toyota, 12 R) with a carburetor fuel system was used for conducting this study. Performance tests were carried out to obtain brake thermal efficiency, <b>brake</b> <b>power,</b> engine torque, <b>brake</b> mean <b>effective</b> pressure and <b>brake</b> specific fuel consumption. In these tests unleaded gasoline-ethanol blends with different percentages of fuel were implemented. Three fuels were used in the tests: 90 Octane unleaded gasoline (E- 0), 95 % gasoline and 5 % ethanol (E- 5), 90 % gasoline and 10 % ethanol (E- 10) and 15 % ethanol and 85 % gasoline (E- 15). Tests were conducted at one-fourth, one-eighth throttle opening positions and at variable engine speed ranging from 500 to 3000 rpm. The results showed that blending unleaded gasoline with ethanol increases the <b>brake</b> <b>power,</b> torque, and <b>brake</b> thermal efficiencies and fuel consumption, while it decreases the brake specific fuel consumption. The E- 10 ratio gave the best <b>brake</b> <b>power</b> against speed when compared to other tests...|$|R

In line with national efforts {{to come up with}} energy sources that are both environmentally friendly and sustainable, this work was carried out to compare performance properties of native crude marula (Sclerocarya birrea) seed oil and petrodiesel fuel on a variable compression engine test rig with automatic data acquisition set up. Parameters such as engine torque, <b>brake</b> <b>power</b> and specific fuel consumption were measured at different loads for the two fuels. The results indicate that engine performance when powered with crude marula oil compares favourable with those for petrodiesel. Optimum numerical values for engine torque, <b>brake</b> <b>power</b> and specific fuel consumption were 28. 2 Nm, 6. 27 W and 0. 34 g/kWh respectively for petrodiesel, and 22. 7 Nm, 6. 6 W, 0. 33 g/kWh respectively for crude marula oil. The engine performance was also analysed for same parameters, namely, engine torque, <b>brake</b> <b>power</b> and specific fuel consumption when powered using the same fuels over a range of compression ratios while the load was fixed at 80 %. Optimum numerical values for engine torque, <b>brake</b> <b>power</b> and specific fuel consumption were 27. 2 Nm, 3. 67 W and 0. 59 g/kWh respectively for petrodiesel, and 26. 3 Nm, 3. 6 W, 0. 34 g/kWh respectively for crude marula oil. The results indicate that compression ratio of 16 : 1 yields optimum engine performance in terms of engine torque and <b>brake</b> <b>power</b> for both fuels under review. However, marula oil fuel recorded smooth steady increase in performance profile across all compression ratios which out-performs petrodiesel on lower compression ratios for engine torque and <b>brake</b> <b>power,</b> and is largely better than petrodiesel on fuel consumption...|$|R

30|$|As for the O 2 {{concentration}} in the exhaust of each fuel, {{it is in a}} negative correlation to CO 2, NOx, torque, and <b>brake</b> <b>power,</b> which indicates that the correlation between the break power of a diesel engine and O 2 concentration is high. The CO 2 {{concentration in}} exhaust was in a positive correlation to NOx, <b>brake</b> <b>power,</b> and torque. This is because the consumption of O 2 generated CO 2 and NOx and the energy conversion resulted in the corresponding <b>brake</b> <b>power</b> and torque. In addition, the NOx concentration in exhaust was a sum of substances such as NO and NO 2, and thus it was in a “positive” correlation to the CO 2 concentration.

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{performance}} of a small two cylinder, 430 cm 3 engine which has been tested in a variety of normally aspirated (NA) and forced induction modes on 98 -RON pump gasoline. These modes are defined by variations in the induction system and associated compression ratio (CR) alterations needed to avoid knock and maximize volumetric efficiency (hVOL). These modes included: (A) NA with carburetion (B) NA with port fuel injection (PFI) (C) Mildly Supercharged (SC) with PFI (D) Highly Turbocharged (TC) with PFI. The results have significant relevance in defining the limitations for small downsized spark ignition (SI) engines, with power increases needed via intake boosting to compensate for the reduced swept volume. Performance is compared in the varying modes with comparisons of <b>brake</b> mean <b>effective</b> pressure (BMEP), <b>brake</b> <b>power,</b> hVOL, <b>brake</b> specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and brake thermal efficiency (hTH). The test engine used in experiments was specifically designed and configured for Formula SAE, SAE’s student Formula race-car competition. A downsized twin cylinder in-line arrangement was chosen, which featured double overhead camshafts and four valves per cylinder. Most of the engine components were specially cast or machined from billets. Experimental results showed BSFC or hTH values in the order of 240 g/kWh or 34 % could be achieved. TC BMEP values in the region of 25 bar were also achieved, the highest recorded for small engines on pump gasoline [1]. The engine was installed into successive Melbourne University Racing (MUR) vehicles in 2003 and 2004, where it was very competitive, finishing first in the fuel economy event at the 2004 Australasian competition. 13 - 16 NovemberOpen Acces...|$|R

To study the effect of compression ratio and percentage of opened air inlet valve on break power, the compression ratio of 7. 5 : 1 and 9. 3 : 1 and percentage of opened air inlet valve of 30 % and 75 % were used.

40|$|The {{replacement}} of diesel fuel by ultra-carbofluids was perceived {{to offer the}} potential to decrease the emissions of environmental pollutants such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons (HC's) and smoke. Such ultracarbofluids consist of a suspension of coal in fuel oil and water generally in the ratio of 5 : 3 : 2 plus {{a small amount of}} stabilising additive. The literature relating to the economies of coal and fuel oil production, and the production and properties of charcoal and vegetable oils has been critically reviewed. The potential use of charcoal and vegetable oils as replacements for coal and fuel oil are discussed. An experimental investigation was undertaken using novel bio-ultracarbofluid formulations. These differed from an ultracarbofluid by having bio-renewable charcoal and vegetable oil in place of coal and fuel oil. Tests were made with a Lister-Petter 600 cc 2 -cylinder, 4 -stroke diesel engine fitted with a Heenan-Froude DPX 1 water brake dynamometer to measure <b>brake</b> <b>power</b> output, and Mexa- 321 E and Mexa- 211 E analysers to measure exhaust pollutants. Measurements were made of engine <b>brake</b> <b>power</b> output, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and smoke emissions over the speed range 1000 to 3000 rpm at 200 rpm intervals. The results were compared with those obtained with a standard diesel reference fuel. All the bio-ultracarbofluid formulations produced lower <b>brake</b> <b>power</b> outputs (i. e. 5. 6 % to 20. 7 % less <b>brake</b> <b>power)</b> but substantially improved exhaust emissions of CO 2, CO, HC's and smoke. The major factor in the formulation was found to be the type and amount of charcoal; charcoal with a high volatile content (27. 2 %) and present at 30 % by mass yielded the best results, i. e. only slightly lower <b>brake</b> <b>power</b> output and significantly lower exhaust pollutants...|$|R
