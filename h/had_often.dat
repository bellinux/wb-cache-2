5|$|A Baptist {{church was}} built, {{also on the}} main road, and opened in 1923. It was a timber-framed {{weatherboard}} building, built on land donated by the first Baptist minister's son, the local butcher. The last service at the church was held 28 April 1985. Prior to this, as attendance declined, the congregations of the Baptist and Uniting Churches <b>had</b> <b>often</b> combined, and roles such as the organist were shared.|$|E
5|$|After the day's play, O'Reilly—a former {{teammate}} of Bradman who was covering the tour as a journalist—consulted Bedser on {{his use of}} leg theory. During his career O'Reilly <b>had</b> <b>often</b> attacked leg stump, and had devised a plan to ensnare Bradman.|$|E
5|$|Ancient authors {{recorded}} that Alexander was {{so pleased}} with portraits of himself created by Lysippos that he forbade other sculptors from crafting his image. Lysippos <b>had</b> <b>often</b> used the contrapposto sculptural scheme to portray Alexander and other characters such as Apoxyomenos, Hermes and Eros. Lysippos' sculpture, {{famous for its}} naturalism, {{as opposed to a}} stiffer, more static pose, is thought to be the most faithful depiction.|$|E
50|$|Soetoro-Ng <b>has</b> <b>often</b> spoken warmly {{about her}} {{relationship}} with her older half-brother, which she says has remained strong even though they <b>have</b> <b>often</b> lived far apart. As adults, they <b>have</b> <b>often</b> celebrated Christmas in Hawaii, and savor the time they spend with their families together.|$|R
40|$|Extract] Late Pleistocene {{rock art}} <b>has</b> <b>often</b> {{remained}} invisible in northern Australia and southern Britain, {{partly because it}} has not been looked for in the rich places, partly because its existence <b>has</b> <b>often</b> been seriously doubled and partly because environmental changes <b>have</b> <b>often</b> obscured the surviving evidence. It was assumed there was no palaeolithic cave art in Britain...|$|R
50|$|Persbrandt <b>has</b> <b>often</b> {{been noted}} for his good looks, and when Swedish media makes {{lists of the}} most {{attractive}} Swedish men, he <b>has</b> <b>often</b> been on those lists.|$|R
5|$|At family gatherings, Victoria <b>had</b> <b>often</b> met Prince Louis of Battenberg, who was {{her first}} cousin once removed {{and a member of}} a morganatic branch of the Hessian royal family. Prince Louis had adopted British {{nationality}} and was serving as an officer in the Royal Navy. In the winter of 1882, they met again at Darmstadt, and were engaged the following summer.|$|E
5|$|In 1782, Allen's brother Heber {{died at the}} {{relatively}} young age of 38. Allen's wife Mary died in June 1783 of consumption, to be followed several months later by their first-born daughter Loraine. While they had not always been close, and Allen's marriage <b>had</b> <b>often</b> been strained, Allen felt these losses deeply. A poem he wrote memorializing Mary {{was published in the}} Bennington Gazette.|$|E
5|$|Jan Zamoyski, one of {{the most}} {{distinguished}} personalities of the period, became the king's principal adviser and manager. A highly educated and cultivated individual, talented military chief and accomplished politician, he <b>had</b> <b>often</b> promoted himself as a tribune of his fellow szlachta. In fact in a typical magnate manner, Zamoyski accumulated multiple offices and royal land grants, removing himself far from the reform movement ideals he professed earlier.|$|E
50|$|The {{sound is}} less {{accessible}} than Fates Warning's other works and many {{say that the}} album required repeated listens to sink in; critics and fans <b>have</b> <b>often</b> <b>had</b> mixed opinions as a result. Indeed, the album <b>has</b> <b>often</b> polarized fans.|$|R
30|$|Philippine {{politics}} <b>have</b> <b>often</b> {{been perceived}} as characterized by patronage, bribery, incentives, and reward system. Survival {{in the political}} arena <b>has</b> <b>often,</b> if not all the time, required the use of such systems.|$|R

5|$|Majure {{was a man}} who {{yearned to}} please his passengers, and if he made them happy then he also made his airline happy. He <b>had</b> <b>often</b> spoken to friends about how {{important}} it was for him to get travelers to their destinations on time and how proud he was of USAir's on-time record. All the same, he was also portrayed as a by-the-book, cautious pilot.|$|E
5|$|Mubarak {{asked the}} current {{aviation}} minister and {{former chief of}} Air Staff Ahmed Shafiq, {{to form a new}} government. Shafiq, a Mubarak loyalist, <b>had</b> <b>often</b> been mentioned as a potential successor to Mubarak due to his politically reliable nature.|$|E
5|$|Sociology {{of leisure}} {{is a fairly}} recent {{subfield}} of sociology, compared to more traditional subfields such as sociology of work, sociology of the family, and sociology of education: it saw most of its development {{in the second half}} of the 20th century. Until then, leisure <b>had</b> <b>often</b> been seen as a relatively unimportant, minor feature of society. Leisure is now recognized as a major social institution, deserving of serious sociological inquiry, particularly in Western societies.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{received}} {{very positive}} reviews from critics upon its release. Critics <b>had</b> <b>often</b> noted {{similarities between the}} episode and Top Gear in their reviews. It attracted nearly two million viewers in its first weekend of release and was eventually made available to non-Amazon Prime members for free viewing from 23 to 26 December 2016.|$|E
5|$|The name <b>had</b> <b>often</b> {{been written}} {{as the single}} word Hongkong until the {{government}} adopted the current form in 1926. Nevertheless, a number of century-old institutions still retain the single-word form, such as the Hongkong Post, Hongkong Electric and the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation.|$|E
5|$|Barnes took {{advantage}} of his reprieve to combine with Morris in an opening stand of 122, as Yardley made frequent bowling changes {{in an attempt to}} disrupt their progress. Wright came on and bowled a no ball, which Morris lofted into the crowd for six. Morris stopped shuffling, while Barnes decided to adopt a strategy of pre-emptively moving down the pitch to Laker. Earlier in the tour, Barnes <b>had</b> <b>often</b> been bowled or trapped lbw trying to force off breaks into the leg side. He drove Laker into the pavilion and Australia were 73/0 at lunch with Morris on 40 and Barnes 25, an overall lead of 208.|$|E
50|$|It <b>has</b> <b>often</b> been {{described}} as gigantic flying snake which produced strange whistling sounds, while its gaze could paralyse an intended victim and permit it to suck its blood. It <b>has</b> <b>often</b> been reported {{as the cause of}} sucking blood from sheep.|$|R
50|$|Speakers of Surgujia <b>have</b> <b>often</b> been conflated {{with those}} of Chhattisgarhi. Furthermore, {{as is the case}} with many Hindi {{languages}} and other regional languages, Surgujia <b>has</b> <b>often</b> been subsumed under the all-encompassing bracket of Standard Hindi due to erroneous, arbitrary or politically-motivated categorisation.|$|R
5000|$|SRO landlords <b>have</b> <b>often</b> {{been called}} [...] "slumlords" [...] {{for failing to}} fix problems, and {{illegally}} evicting tenants.

5|$|Carney's {{appointment}} to diplomatic postings {{in countries that}} <b>had</b> <b>often</b> difficult relations with the United States earned him both praise and criticism from observers for his hands-on diplomatic style. His strong views on Iraq's reconstruction efforts after the war in 2003 were in part responsible for a wholesale change in the Bush administration's strategy to stabilize the war-torn nation. He also advocated engagement with Sudan {{at a time when}} White House officials and the C.I.A. wanted the U.S. Embassy closed in Khartoum.|$|E
5|$|Columbia Pictures {{executive}} Amy Pascal suggested Angelina Jolie to Noyce, who <b>had</b> <b>often</b> {{spoken to}} Jolie {{in the past}} about a desire to create a female spy franchise. Pascal even invited Jolie for a Bond girl role, but the actress playfully replied that she {{was more interested in}} playing James Bond himself instead. Jolie was sent Salts script in September 2008 and liked it. Wimmer, Noyce, and producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura went to visit Jolie at her home in France to discuss a possible script and character change. Writer Brian Helgeland helped with the character development and dialogue of the script based on the notes that came out of those discussions with Jolie and to accompany the gender change, the title character's name was changed to Evelyn Salt.|$|E
5|$|In 1632, Sigismund III Vasa, {{the king}} of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, died. Russia, having {{recovered}} {{to a certain extent}} from the Time of Troubles, decided to capitalize on the temporary confusion of its western neighbor. Russia's aim was to gain control of Smolensk, which it had ceded to the Commonwealth in 1618 at the Truce of Deulino, ending the last Russo-Polish War. Smolensk was the capital of the Commonwealth's Smoleńsk Voivodeship, but it <b>had</b> <b>often</b> been contested, and it changed hands many times during the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries (from the days of the Muscovite-Lithuanian Wars).|$|E

5|$|Indeed, the {{evacuation}} of casualties and the resupply of ammunition at times proved problematic, and heavy shelling and sniper fire disrupted stretcher parties and porters {{on a number of}} occasions, resulting in the forward companies running short of ammunition. Meanwhile, the quality of support given to the British and Australian infantry by the artillery and tanks was of a high standard and proved a critical factor. Indeed, the tanks <b>had</b> <b>often</b> operated in terrain to which they were unsuited, while the New Zealand gunners had fired over 50,000 rounds in direct support of 3 RAR, blistering the paint off the barrels of their guns. Air support, including that provided by the South African Mustangs, had been important throughout.|$|E
5|$|Keynes was {{a lifelong}} {{member of the}} Liberal Party, which until the 1920s {{had been one of}} the two main {{political}} parties in the United Kingdom, and as late as 1916 <b>had</b> <b>often</b> been the dominant power in government. Keynes had helped campaign for the Liberals at elections from about 1906, yet he always refused to run for office himself, despite being asked to do so on three separate occasions in 1920. From 1926, when Lloyd George became leader of the Liberals, Keynes took a major role in defining the party's economics policy, but by then the Liberals had been displaced into third party status by the Labour Party.|$|E
5|$|Kipandjikusmin {{later wrote}} to Ekspres {{magazine}} that his goal {{in writing the}} short story was to expose the corruption in Sukarno's government, focusing on the religious leaders who had agreed with Nasakom when it was politically expedient to do so, yet turned against the PKI when the party was hunted and its members killed. He also admitted the influences proposed by Jassin, writing that he <b>had</b> <b>often</b> thought of the Catholic heaven as being similar to the Javanese Kahyangan, with God being similar to Batara Guru. His depictions of Muhammad and Gabriel transforming into eagles were influenced by images of Christ as the Lamb of God. It was originally {{meant to be a}} serial, and Jassin had already received the second instalment by the time the controversy began.|$|E
