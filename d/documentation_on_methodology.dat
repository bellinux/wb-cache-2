40|$|Abstract. With the {{evolution}} of an API library, its documentation also evolves. The evolution of API documentation is common knowledge for programmers and library developers, {{but not in a}} quantitative form. Without such quantitative knowledge, programmers may neglect important revisions of API documentation, and library developers may not effectively improve API <b>documentation</b> based <b>on</b> its revision histories. There is a strong need to conduct a quantitative study <b>on</b> API <b>documentation</b> evolution. However, as API documentation is large in size and revisions can be complicated, it is quite challenging to conduct such a study. In this paper, we present an analysis methodology to analyze {{the evolution}} of API <b>documentation.</b> Based <b>on</b> the <b>methodology,</b> we conduct a quantitative study <b>on</b> API <b>documentation</b> evolution of five widely used real-world libraries. The results reveal various valuable findings, and these findings allow programmers and library developers to better understand API documentation evolution. ...|$|R

40|$|Committee (SSC) {{with results}} of his {{analysis}} of preliminary sardine allocation alternatives ([1], [2]). At that time, the SSC made recommendations for improving the analysis and indicated a need to review the sardine processor data and the associated data collection methodology. In May, Dr. Herrick provided the SSC Economics Subcommittee with <b>documentation</b> <b>on</b> the processor <b>methodology</b> and data. The Subcommittee reviewed the documentation and provided Dr. Herrick with further elaboration on the SSC’s April comments regarding the economic analysis ([3]). At this (June 2005) meeting, Dr. Herrick provided the SSC with {{an updated version of}} his processor data documentation ([4]), as well as a draft environmental assessment (DEA) pertaining to an updated list of allocation alternatives ([5], [6]). The SSC appreciates Dr. Herrick’s responsiveness to many of the concerns expressed at the April meeting and later by the Economics Subcommittee. Specifically, Dr. Herrick has (1) provided an analysis of alternatives based on the exvessel value of landings, (2) elaborated on the assumptions underlying his economic analysis (e. g., stability of exvessel prices), and (3) provided a rationale for not considering fixed costs in his analysis (namely, given the expected stability of processing capacity over the likely duration of the pending sardin...|$|R
