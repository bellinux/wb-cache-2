If a <b>damage</b> <b>function</b> is used that shows smooth and regular damages, e.g., a cubic function, the results suggest that emission abatement should be postponed. This is because the benefits of early abatement are outweighed by the benefits of investing in other areas that accelerate economic growth.

Based on the finding of broad damage distributions we investigate two possible functional forms to characterize the data.

5000|$|The {{agent-based}} model {{developed for}} the study considered three types of agents: invasive species, importers, and border enforcement agents. [...] In the model, the invasive species can only react to their surroundings, while the importers and border enforcement agents {{are able to make}} their own decisions based on their own goals and objectives. The invasive species has the ability to determine if it has been released in an area containing the target crop, and to spread to adjacent plots of the target crop. The model incorporates spatial probability maps that are used to determine if an invasive species becomes established. The study focused on shipments of broccoli from Mexico into California through the ports of entry Calexico, California and Otay Mesa, California. The selected invasive species of concern was the crucifer flea beetle (Phyllotreta cruciferae). California is by far the largest producer of broccoli in the United States and so the concern and potential impact of an invasive species introduction through the chosen ports of entry is significant. The model also incorporated a spatially explicit <b>damage</b> <b>function</b> that was used to model invasive species damage in a realistic manner. Agent-based modeling provides the ability to analyze the behavior of heterogeneous actors, so three different types of importers were considered that differed in terms of commodity infection rates (high, medium, and low), pretreatment choice, and cost of transportation to the ports. The model gave predictions on inspection rates for each port of entry and importer and determined the success rate of border agent inspection, not only for each port and importer but also for each potential level of pretreatment (no pretreatment, level one, level two, and level three).|$|E

In order to determine an optimal and reasonable level of customer service, reliability cost/worth can be performed by calculating the costs associated with different system configurations and assessing the corresponding reliability worth.. The main objective of this research was to examine the. ability to perform reliability worth assessment by applying appropriate customer <b>damage</b> <b>functions</b> (CDF) at different load points in a distribution system. The reliability worth assessment was performed by linking distribution system predictive reliability indices with the customer interruption costs associated With power supply interruptions at the various load points. This thesis is concerned with the sensitivity analysis of the expected customer outage cost (ECOST) using both load point customer <b>damage</b> <b>functions</b> (LPCDF) and sector customer <b>damage</b> <b>functions</b> (SCDF). This thesis also illustrates the impact on the ECOST of selected distribution system parameters using both LPCDF and SCDF. Customer <b>damage</b> <b>functions</b> utilized in the evaluation of ECOST can vary substantially due to the composition of the customers at the different load points in the system. Thel. sensitivity studies show that the ECOST is highly dependent on the actual customer composition. This thesis also illustrates the application of relevant customer <b>damage</b> <b>functions</b> to evaluate the ECOST on an actual distribution system feeder located in the City of Saskatoon.

Damage assessment typically relies on <b>damage</b> <b>functions</b> that translate the magnitude of extreme events to a quantifiable damage.

The study of the characteristics of <b>damage</b> <b>functions</b> for different hazards could strengthen the theoretical foundation of <b>damage</b> <b>functions</b> and support their development and validation. Accordingly, we investigate analogies of <b>damage</b> <b>functions</b> for coastal flooding and for wind storms and identify a unified approach. This approach has general applicability for granular portfolios and may also be applied, for example, to heat-related mortality. Moreover, the unification enables the transfer of methodology between hazards and a consistent treatment of uncertainty. This is demonstrated by a sensitivity analysis on the basis of two simple case studies (for coastal flood and storm damage). The analysis reveals the relevance of the various uncertainty sources at varying hazard magnitude and on both the microscale and the macroscale level. Main findings are the dominance of uncertainty from the hazard magnitude and the persistent behaviour of intrinsic uncertainties on both scale levels.

This type of representation is a reduced form because is not pest population levels per se that drive damage, but the underlying factors that affect pest populations and the susceptibility of the host. We specify and estimate a structural <b>damage</b> <b>function</b> and compare the results with those of the reduced form. We do so using two alternative models, one that explains the level of crop damage from a pest, and one that explains the timing of that damage during the host’s growing season.

In formulating the structural <b>damage</b> <b>function,</b> we draw from current scientific literature on olive fly and olive fruit phenology. The structural <b>damage</b> <b>function</b> takes into account the feedback between climate, host susceptibility, and pest populations.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{objective of this}} thesis {{is to develop a}} program that makes use of three types of damage functions to optimize the weapon aimpoints of multiple coordinate-seeking weapons against a unitary target in order to achieve the highest probability of damage (PD). A MATLAB program is used as the coding tool for the development of this algorithm and the optimization process. The program works by first taking in the number of weapons used and arranging them in a fixed uniform spacing on a circle centered on the assumed target location. Then, the weapon characteristics such as the radius of the circle containing the weapon aimpoint, impact angle, dependent (aiming) and independent (ballistic) errors are taken into account, before utilizing each of the three damage functions representing the weapon. A Monte-Carlo simulation method is used to calculate the PDs at incremental radii of weapon placements from the target. Since the damage functions differ in terms of fidelity (accuracy), a comparison in terms of optimal aimpoint radius for the highest PD is made for the results generated for all three damage functions. The simulated results demonstrated that the optimal aimpoint radii for the maximum PD are slightly different for each <b>damage</b> <b>function.</b> In addition, the maximum PD at the optimal aimpoint radius generated for each <b>damage</b> <b>function</b> is lowest for a <b>damage</b> <b>function</b> that has the greatest fidelity (accuracy), which is consistent with the calculated results for single weapons against unitary targets.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an integrated assessment approach for considering the options that electric utilities {{have to meet}} the anticipated demand for their power. The objective that this paper considers is one of meeting the demand for power, with an acceptable degree of reliability, at minimum cost. The total cost {{is the sum of}} the private cost of producing the electric power plus the external costs that result from its production. These external costs, or externalities, are effects on the well-being of third parties that producers and consumers of electric power do not take into account in their decisions. The external costs include many different types of effects such as illness, ecosystem damage, and road damage. The {{solution to the problem of}} minimizing total cost is addressed in two steps. The first step uses <b>damage</b> <b>function</b> methods to establish a common metric for the weights of the different objectives (i. e., external costs). The <b>damage</b> <b>function</b> analysis also reduces the dimensionality of the analysis in the second step, and identifies criteria to include in that analysis.
