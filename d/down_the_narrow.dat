25|$|In May 1972, two loyalist gunmen {{called to}} the MacBride family's door and Nora MacBride, who was {{carrying}} a baby at the time, went to answer the door. The men duped Mrs. MacBride into opening the door by stating {{that they were looking}} for Frank, a building contractor, and were seeking work. When the door was opened the gunmen then saw Frank coming <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrow</b> hallway to see who was at the door. They opened fire shooting Frank in the shoulder, hand and thighs, then Antoine came out from a side room to protect his father and was shot in the leg. Frank MacBride was hit by 12 bullets and never recovered from the attack, dying 17 months later.|$|E
25|$|Between 20:00 and 22:00, the Worcestershire Regiment {{collected}} their 11 wounded, carrying {{those who}} could not ride on blankets <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrow</b> ravine to the waiting sand carts. At 22:00, the regiment, followed by the Gloucester and Warwick Yeomanry, came under machine gun fire in the moonlight from the Ottoman defenders, holding Khuweilfe. It was only under very difficult circumstances that the wounded could be brought back from the , when many helpers and wounded were killed. Many of these further casualties occurred when they had to pass through a shrapnel zone, as there were no regular communication trenches. The Worcestershire Regiment returned to Beersheba along the Jerusalem road, leaving lightly wounded who were riding at the Anzac Mounted Division receiving station near Keirdirat. The Worcestershire Regiment (5th Mounted Brigade) finally watered their horses at 04:00 on 5 November after the horses had been 45 hours without water. They remained at Beersheba until 7 November, when they marched to Sheria.|$|E
25|$|The natural {{boundaries}} of the fell are Bassenthwaite Lake to the east, Wythop Valley {{to the south and}} west, and the Vale of Embleton to the north. Sale Fell is a satellite of Lord's Seat, the highest of the hills north of Whinlatter. The connecting high ground runs south eastward above the shore of Bassenthwaite before turning inland to the summit of the parent fell. The connection is extremely tenuous, passing along a very narrow strip of land between Wythop Beck and Beck Wythop. These two streams run side by side down the slopes of Lord's Seat before diverging to surround Sale Fell on all sides. Wythop Beck is the main stream of the Wythop Valley, running west around Sale Fell and then out <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrow</b> wooded defile which stands between it and Ling Fell. Joining the Dubwath Beck it then flows eastward along the Vale of Embleton and into the northern end of Bassenthwaite. Beck Wythop by contrast cuts through the ridge of high ground running alongside Bassenthwaite, and drops directly into the lake.|$|E

500|$|Mansfield {{has been}} called [...] "the legal genius of his generation", and {{compared}} favourably with Joseph Story, a judge of the Supreme Court of the United States noted for his brilliance. Other Americans such as Julian S. Waterman, {{the founder of the}} University of Arkansas School of Law, described him as [...] "not only the greatest common law judge but the greatest judge in Anglo-American legal history", while Joseph Story himself said that Mansfield [...] "broke <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrow</b> barrier of the common law, redeemed it from feudal selfishness and barbarity" [...] and that [...] "he was one of those great men raised up by Providence, at a fortunate moment, to effect a salutary revolution in the world".|$|E
500|$|Kennedy {{placed the}} 90 men {{of his company}} in {{position}} facing in an arc from west to northeast; the 2nd Platoon took the left flank near the stone wall, the 1st Platoon took the center position on a wooded knoll, and the 3rd Platoon the right flank {{at the edge of}} a woods. Just as he reached the top, Second Lieutenant Thomas T. Jones, commanding the 3rd Platoon, saw and heard three North Korean mortars fire from [...] away on a grassy ridge to the east. He suggested to Kennedy that artillery fire be directed on these mortars, but Kennedy did not act on the suggestion. Kennedy established his command post inside the tunnel behind the 2nd Platoon position. The D Company position was entirely within the area enclosed by the stone wall, which was nearly intact except on the northeast near the 3rd Platoon position where it had crumbled and was covered with brush and trees. Jones pointed out to his platoon sergeant and squad leaders where he wanted them to take position at the edge of the woods facing the North Korean mortars he had seen on the grassy ridge beyond. He then remained a few minutes in conversation with Kennedy. A few minutes later Jones joined his 3rd Squad men at the edge of the woods. They told him that the platoon sergeant and the rest had continued on toward the narrow grassy ridge. One of the squad members called Jones to the edge of the woods and pointed out 12 well-camouflaged North Korean soldiers, one of them carrying a machine gun, coming <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrow</b> ridge toward them from the mortar position. This group was a security force for the mortars and they dropped to the ground about one-third of the way down the ridge.|$|E

2500|$|At {{daylight}} German and Ottoman forces {{pushed through}} Es Salt to attack {{and press the}} 1st Light Horse Brigade rearguard until it was [...] from Es Salt. At the same time enemy guns heavily shelled the light horse rearguard and several German and Ottoman aircraft caused a number of casualties when they bombed the retiring columns as they moved <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrow,</b> steep-sided gorge. The light horse rearguard was about halfway between Es Salt and Umm esh Shert at dawn, when all the British Empire reconnaissance aircraft were sent off carrying four 20-lb. bombs.|$|E
2500|$|The Taliban retaliated in 1998 {{attacking the}} city and killing an {{estimated}} 8,000. At 10 am on 8 August 1998, the Taliban entered {{the city and}} for the next two days drove their pickup trucks [...] "up and <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrow</b> streets of Mazar-i-Sharif shooting to the left and right and killing everything that movedâ€”shop owners, cart pullers, women and children shoppers and even goats and donkeys." [...] More than 8000 noncombatants were reported killed in Mazar-i-Sharif and later in Bamiyan. In addition, the Taliban were criticized for forbidding anyone from burying the corpses for the first six days (contrary to the injunctions of Islam, which demands immediate burial) while the remains rotted in the summer heat and were eaten by dogs. The Taliban also reportedly sought out and massacred members of the Hazara, while in control of Mazar.|$|E

60|$|If {{you look}} for extravagance of colour, for flaming shop fronts and glaring lanterns, you shall find {{none of these things}} in <b>the</b> <b>narrow</b> stone-paved streets of Nagasaki. But if you desire details of house construction, glimpses of perfect cleanliness, rare taste, and perfect {{subordination}} of the thing made {{to the needs of the}} maker, you shall find all you seek and more. All the roofs are dull lead colour, being shingled or tiled, and all the house fronts are of the colour of the wood as God made it. There is neither smoke nor haze, and in the clear light of a clouded sky I could see <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrowest</b> alleyway as into the interior of a cabinet.|$|R
50|$|Despite the {{resistance}} from the anchors of the Esso Brussels, the engines of Sea Witch, still running full reverse, were pulling both ships <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>Narrows.</b> This movement created a suction force which pinned the Esso Brussels lifeboat against the tankers hull and brought the pool of flaming oil around to the port side of the ship. A last-second attempt to row the lifeboat away from the advancing fire failed to overpower the suction, and as the flames grew nearer to the lifeboat, many of the crew jumped into {{the water in a}} desperate attempt to escape the flames.|$|R
