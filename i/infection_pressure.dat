Design Retrospective cohort design using hospital discharge data for dementia patients, case matched on sex, age, comorbidity and surgical status on a 1 ?:? 4 ratio to non-dementia patients. Setting Public hospital discharge {{data from the}} state of New South Wales, Australia for 2006 / 2007. Participants 426 276 overnight hospital episodes for patients aged 50 and above (census sample). Main outcome measures Rates of preventable complications, with episode-level risk adjustment for 12 complications that are known to be sensitive to nursing care. Results Controlling for age and comorbidities, surgical dementia patients had higher rates than non-dementia patients in seven of the 12 complications: urinary tract <b>infections,</b> <b>pressure</b> ulcers, delirium, pneumonia, physiological and metabolic derangement (all at p< 0. 0001), sepsis and failure to rescue (at p< 0. 05). Medical dementia patients also had higher rates of these complications than did non-dementia patients. The highest rates and highest relative risk for dementia patients compared with non-dementia patients, in both medical and surgical populations, were found in four common complications: urinary tract <b>infections,</b> <b>pressure</b> areas, pneumonia and delirium.

50|$|The {{decreased}} {{health status}} of pigs, {{as a consequence of}} roundworm infection, is reflected in general production parameters like daily weight gain, feed conversion efficiency and meat quality. However, in farms with low infection levels, the effect of infection is expected to be minimal and the economical profitability of active Ascaris control can be questioned. It is difficult to determine the economical losses due to parasites that are not lethal. There are numerous interactions between the worm, the host, the presence of other diseases, the production system and many other factors. Recent evaluations of the economical performance of infected pig farms has indicated that the improved feed conversion, increased daily weight gain, lower mortality and better carcass quality act in a synergetic way. Hence, strategic deworming should result in a win-win effect on economic and environmental performances with gross profit margin increases of 3 to 12 euro per average present finisher per year. To distinguish between pig populations that suffer significant economical damage and those that are less affected, we depend on the availability of diagnostic tools to provide us with information on the presence and <b>infection</b> <b>pressure</b> of this parasite on a farm. If interpreted correctly, diagnostic tools can be of use to evaluate the applied control strategies and see whether efforts for parasite control need to be increased or changed.|$|E
50|$|Routine {{anthelmintic}} treatments, {{commonly used}} in intensive pig rearing systems, are not systematic and treatment schemes vary according to farm and animal category. The breeding stock is usually treated with 3-4 month intervals or prior to farrowing. (Roepstorff and Nansen, 1994). Piglets are typically treated upon entering the fattening units and maybe once more halfway the fattening period. However, these treatment schemes seem to be unable to significantly decrease the infection intensity on a farm. Treatment frequency {{must be based on}} the prepatent period of the worm species. For Ascaris this is 42 days. However, when anthelmintic treatment is ineffective i/n killing the migrating larval stages, it is possible that egg shedding occurs earlier as larvae remain in the lung up to 10 days post infection (Roepstorff et al., 1997). Treatment of pigs every 5 weeks would therefore eliminate the worms before they are able to produce millions of eggs and contaminate the environment all over again. When a strict deworming process is applied, the infectivity of the environment will drop, as new hosts will take up eggs from the environment, and eggs will be swept away by cleaning actions or eventually lose their viability. This will ultimately result in a stock of pigs with a reduced or absent parasitic burden. It is important to understand that persistence in the repeated application of the anthelmintic is necessary. If the environmental contamination is high, it will most likely take several fattening rounds to eventually reduce the <b>infection</b> <b>pressure</b> (Bakker, 1984; Jourquin, 2007).Both the fact that infections usually seem to occur in the fattening units and the fact that anthelmintic treatment has limited persistent activity against recurring infectious larvae lead to believe that the common practice of treating pigs prior to, or upon arrival in the fattening units, might be superfluous. In two experiments, {{it has been reported that}} a single anthelmintic treatment of fatteners at the start of the fattening period is not justified on economie grounds. It showed to be ineffective in reducing parasite prevalence and it did not have a positive effect on performance results, nor did it influence the incidence of other lesions like white spots (Boes et al., 2010; Nilsson, 1982; Roepstorff and Jorsal, 1990). More importantly, Roepstorff (1997) showed that, depending on the infection status, it might sometimes be more economically beneficial to switch from a routine anthelmintic treatment program to the conditional usage of anthelmintics, treating only when parasite levels reach an unacceptable level. This should however be supported by routine diagnostic screening of pigs from different age categories and is probably only applicable to farms with moderate to highly intensive management.|$|E

50|$|Routine {{applications}} of anthelmintic drug seem {{to appeal to}} pig farmers for reasons of convenience (Nansen and Roepstorff, 1999). However, merely resorting to anthelmintic treatment could result in little or no improvement due to continuous reinfection. The use of anthelmintics therefore needs to be complemented by higher quality farm hygiene and more effective farm management practices if one strives to reduce the roundworm <b>infection</b> <b>pressure</b> on the farm.There are numerous aspects of farm management that can {{have a major impact}} on the epidemiology of A. suum. Undoubtedly, the type of production system, stable infrastructure and different management factors like the application of a quarantine for imported pigs, all-in-all-out practice, early weaning, and the efficiency of cleaning protocols will affect Ascaris epidemiology. The type of production system that is in use will be a key factor regarding the infection intensity on a farm (Nansen and Roepstorff, 1999). For obvious reasons, there is a higher diversity of parasite species and higher infection intensity on traditional farms and where pigs have access to outdoor facilities when compared to intensive indoor systems (Lai et al., 2011; Roepstorff and Nansen, 1994). Reducing contact of pigs with their own faecal deposits or from pigs from previous rounds is important. Consequentially, housing of pigs on slatted floors seems to reduce the chance of parasite infestation compared to solid or partially slatted floors (Roepstorff and Jorsal, 1990; Sanchez-Vazquez et al., 2010; Tielen et al., 1978). Increased risk is associated with bedding being present in the pens. The use of bedding material may provide extra refugia that promote egg embryonation and hamper the effectiveness of repeated cleaning and disinfection measures. Evidently, the stocking density in the pig house will also be important (Tielen et al., 1978), as chances of pens containing pigs with patent infections will increase. Positioning the water supply in the dung area instead of in the lying area or the feeding troughs seems to be associated with a decreased prevalence of A. suum (Roepstorff et al., 1999). Water spillage in areas where eggs are present will enhance the chances for survival of the eggs due to constant humidity. Despite the extremely rigid eggshell, eggs do not embryonate when relative humidity is low, for instance in the dry resting areas in pig pens, or when floor temperatures are lower than 15 °C. Additionally, pig urine also seems to exhibit a strong inhibitory effect on the development of A. suum eggs (Nilsson, 1982). Once in the environment, the eggs will embryonate until the infective larvae are present inside the egg. Only then, the egg is infective for a new host. In a Danish study it was shown that A. suum eggs could embryonate on a pasture within 4-6 weeks during a normal Danish summer (Roepstorff and Murrell, 1997). These results were supported by experiments in laboratory conditions, during which it was observed that, although motile larvae were noticed from 4 weeks post-incubation, an incubation period of at least 6 weeks at room temperature was needed for eggs to become infective in mice (Geenen et al., 1999). When environmental factors like temperature, oxygen availability and relative humidity are suboptimal, the time for larvae to become infective increases (Nilsson, 1982). This is reflected by the fact that white spot levels seem to vary within farms depending on the season. Presumably, the rising temperatures in spring and summer allow the eggs that have overwintered in the stables to massively develop into the infective larval stage, leading to heavier infective environments and subsequently higher liver condemnation rates in summer and early autumn (Lai et al., 2011; Menzies et al., 1994; Nilsson, 1982; Sanchez-Vazquez et al., 2012).In intensive indoor systems, the presence of a breeding stock on a farm seems to be associated with a lower chance of A. suum being present on the farm. More often than not, farmers are unaware of the parasite status of the pigs that are bought from external producers. Therefore, importing pigs from piglet producers evidently increases the risk of introducing new infections into the herd. Farmers with fattening herds are advised to buy piglets from larger piglet producers with good management and hygiene (Joachim et al., 2001b) and that were preferably treated prior to delivery. Whether weaners need to be treated at the beginning of fattening or not is open for discussion. However, if their worm-free status cannot be warranted, incoming pigs should be treated upon arrival, hereby reducing the risk of introducing the infection into their herd. Once A. suum is present on the farm, it is easily dispersed over the whole farm through moving animals and dirty materials and boots. Even flies have shown to carry A. suum eggs (Forster et al., 2009).Other management practices like the use of the all-in-all-out system, and early weaning are linked to lower prevalence of A. suum (Joachim et al., 2001b; Roepstorff and Jorsal, 1990; Roepstorff et al., 1999; Tielen et al., 1978). In the all-in-all-out production system, pigs are moved into and out of facilities in distinct groups with the hope that, by preventing the commingling of groups, the spread of disease is reduced. This practice also allows for a period of thorough cleaning and disinfecting between subsequent groups of animals. Early weaning of piglets (3-5 weeks) also seems to be associated with a reduced risk of A. suum infection (Roepstorff et al., 1999). However it is likely that this can be attributed to the fact that both these parameters are associated with other factors that are more important for parasite survival, like for instance, the use of more traditional rearing methods or poorer general pen hygiene.Frequent cleaning of the pens, preferably after each round, is indispensable to destroy or reduce the amount of eggs in the environment. Clearly, the presence of rough and uneven surfaces would provide a good microenvironment for egg development and have an impact on the efficiency of cleaning protocols. Joachim et al., (2001) indicated that in older pens, the prevalence of Ascaris infections was significantly higher (63,0%) than in the new pens (27,9%). Moreover, Nilsson (1982) found high number of eggs (up to 3,000 EPG) in the crevices of the floor between the slatted dung area and the resting area of the pen. Approximately half of these eggs appeared to be embryonated. In a study by Beloeil et al., (2003) 31% of the farms surveyed had residual dung in the fattening pens when restocking them with new fattening pigs, a practice, favouring the transmission of A. suum eggs. Even though careful cleaning of the pens with high-pressure water will remove most of the residual dung, it seems ineffective to completely remove all infective eggs (Nilsson, 1982). The use of disinfectants is very effective against bacteria, but is rather ineffective against A. suum eggs. Instead, steam cleaning and drying of the pens is a highly recommended management practice for killing roundworm eggs. These are, however, hard to comply with in practice.Looking to the future, the percentage of Ascaris-favourable production systems is expected to rise due to increasing consumer demand for drug free, biologically grown, free-range pork and the forthcoming implementation of new regulations for increased pig wellbeing. In Denmark for example, sprinkler systems should be applied in the pens of growing pigs and sows to accommodate a daily shower. Moreover, sows should not be tethered and housed in groups in enriched environments (bedding, wallowing) for part of the gestation (Roepstorff et al., 2011a; Thamsborg et al., 2010). As a result, the number of eggs surviving in the pens will increase and with it, the prevalence of Ascaris and other pig parasites (Haugegaard, 2010). Good diagnostic assessments will be necessary to evaluate how these changes in farm management will affect parasite epidemiology.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background In Europe, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is {{the main}} {{definitive}} host of Echinococcus multilocularis, the aetiological agent of a severe disease in humans called alveolar echinococcosis. The distribution of this zoonotic parasite among the fox population is remarkably aggregated with few heavily infected animals harbouring much of the parasite burdens and being {{responsible for most of}} the environmental parasitic egg contamination. Important research questions explored were: (i) spatial differences in parasite <b>infection</b> <b>pressure</b> related to the level of urbanization; (ii) temporal differences in parasite <b>infection</b> <b>pressure</b> in relation to time of the year; (iii) is herd immunity or an age-dependent <b>infection</b> <b>pressure</b> responsible for the observed parasite abundance; (iv) assuming E. multilocularis infection is a clumped process, how many parasites results from a regular infection insult. Methods By developing and comparing different transmission models we characterised the spatio-temporal variation of the <b>infection</b> <b>pressure,</b> in terms of numbers of parasites that foxes acquired after exposure per unit time, in foxes in Zurich (Switzerland). These included the variations in <b>infection</b> <b>pressure</b> with age of fox and season and the possible regulating effect of herd immunity on parasite abundance. Results The model fitting best to the observed data supported the existence of spatial and seasonal differences in <b>infection</b> <b>pressure</b> and the absence of parasite-induced host immunity. The periodic <b>infection</b> <b>pressure</b> had different amplitudes across urbanization zones with higher peaks during autumn and winter. In addition, the model indicated the existence of variations in <b>infection</b> <b>pressure</b> among age groups in foxes from the periurban zone. Conclusions These heterogeneities in infection exposure have strong implications for the implementation of targeted control interventions to lower the intensity of environmental contamination with parasite eggs and, ultimately, the infection risk to humans...|$|E

40|$|Infection by {{parasitic}} {{sea lice}} {{is a substantial}} problem in industrial scale salmon farming. To control the problem, Norwegian salmonid farms {{are not permitted to}} exceed a threshold level of infection on their fish, and farms are required to monitor and report lice levels on a weekly basis to ensure compliance with the regulation. In the present study, we combine the monitoring data with a deterministic model for salmon lice population dynamics to estimate farm production of infectious lice stages. Furthermore, we use an empirical estimate of the relative risk of salmon lice transmission between farms, that depend on inter-farm distances, to estimate the external <b>infection</b> <b>pressure</b> at a farm site, i. e. the <b>infection</b> <b>pressure</b> from infective salmon lice of neighbouring farm origin.

40|$|Animals {{will show}} reduced {{production}} {{when exposed to}} a constant <b>infection</b> <b>pressure</b> unless they are fully resistant, {{the size of the}} reduction depending on the degree of resistance and the severity of infection. In this article, the use of QTL for disease resistance for improving productivity under constant <b>infection</b> <b>pressure</b> is investigated using stochastic simulation. A previously published model was used with two thresholds for resistance: a threshold below which production is not possible and a threshold above which production is not affected by the infection. Between thresholds, observed production under constant infection is a multiplicative function of underlying potential production and level of resistance. Some simplifications of reality were adopted in the model, such as no genetic correlation between potential production and resistance, the absence of influence of lack of resistance on reproductive capacity, and the availability of phenotypes in both sexes. Marker-assisted selection was incorporated by assuming a proportion of the genetic variance to be explained by the QTL, which thus is defined as a continuous trait. Phenotypes were available for production, not for resistance. The <b>infection</b> <b>pressure</b> may vary across time. Results were compared to mass selection on production under constant as well as intermittent <b>infection</b> <b>pressure,</b> where the <b>infection</b> <b>pressure</b> varied between but not within years. Selection started in a population with a very poor level of resistance. Incorporation of QTL information is valuable (i. e., the increase in observed production relative to mass selection) when {{a large proportion of the}} additive genetic variance is explained by the QTL (50 % genetic variance explained) and when the heritability for resistance is low (h 2 R = 0. 1). Under constant <b>infection</b> <b>pressure,</b> incorporating QTL information does not increase selection responses in observed production when the QTL effect explains less than 25 % of the genetic variance. Under intermittent selection pressure, the use of QTL information gives a slightly greater increase in observed production in early generations, relative to mass selection on observed production, but still only when the QTL effect is large or the heritability for resistance is low. The additional advantage of incorporating QTL information is that use of (preventive) medical treatment is possible, or animals may be evaluated in uninfected environments...|$|E

40|$|Results from 2004 {{showed that}} the lice <b>infection</b> <b>pressure</b> varied between the {{different}} monitoring stations {{in time and space}} and that the overall pattern was moderate to high infection in all areas. This is {{in spite of the fact}} that the fish farmers have improved their implementation of delousing strategies in fish farms. The density of fish farms is high all along the coast. The total biomass may therefore be so high that the "legal' lice numbers per fish not will be sufficiently low to reduce the <b>infection</b> <b>pressure</b> to sustainable levels. This may be the reason for the relatively high infection levels seen on sea trout in Eresfjorden, Hitra and Vik in Vesterålen. Slightly increased infections were also found in Altafjorden (Finnmark) during the summer period. In Troms and Finnmark, most of the fish farmers delouse during late autumn. This may result in the low <b>infection</b> <b>pressure</b> during spring and early summer, but also lead to pronounced <b>infection</b> <b>pressure</b> during late summer and autumn. Therefore, fish farmers must increase their focus on delousing this part of the year. Another source of infection may be from ascending wild salmonids. The <b>infection</b> <b>pressure</b> during the postsmolt phase of Atlantic salmon in 2004 was relatively low in Altafjorden and Trondheimsfjorden compared to earlier findings from the fjords in Western Norway. The trawling for postsmolts from Trondheimsfjorden in 2004 was concentrated to week 20 and a low infection rate was found. In the Altafjord we observed for the first time since the postsmolts surveys started in this fjord that the postsmolts were infected by salmon lice but both intensity and prevalence was low. Parallel captures of wild sea trout and Arctic charr in the littoral zone in Altafjorden and at Hitra outside the Trondheimsfjord {{showed that the}} <b>infection</b> <b>pressure</b> on sea trout and Arctic charr was high during the postsmolt stage of Atlantic salmon. The risk and consequences of the infection on Atlantic salmon postsmolts will therefore depend on the intensity of the infection pulse and, whether this pulse coincides with the smolt migration period. Low sea temperatures in the spring and early summer in Finnmark may cause the <b>infection</b> <b>pressure</b> and the smolt migration period not to coincide, and that the postsmolts may migrate to the open sea without being infected by salmon lice in these areas. In addition, the salmon farmers have focused on keeping low lice numbers during the smolt migration period. This may be the reason to the reduced salmon lice <b>infection</b> <b>pressure</b> for postsmolts of Atlantic salmon all along the Norwegian coast. The status for sea trout is not so positive. Monitoring of the lice pressure on sea trout in 2004 still show high infection levels of salmon lice. On most of the locations there are no positive effects of the National Action Plan Against Salmon Lice on Salmonids. It appears that the aim of less than 10 lice per sea trout will be difficult to achieve. In areas with intensive fish farming activity the delousing limits should be reduced below the prevailing limits. Increased focus must be on delousing in fish farms during summer. Field monitoring, as performed in 2004, must be continued in order to assess whether the impact of delousing strategies in fish farms are sufficient, and to generate necessary scientific knowledge to be able to manage the salmon lice problems on wild and farmed salmonids. We must concentrate sampling to the monitoring stations where we already have long time data series on sea trout, Arctic charr and Atlantic salmon...|$|E

Within {{the first two years}} of our research a reduction of the total amount of copper per hectare could be accomplished when applying the new developed forecast system ÖKO-SIMPHYT. With this decision support system a reduction of copper up to 46 % was possible, when the <b>infection</b> <b>pressure</b> was relatively low. These first results have now to be proven under high <b>infection</b> <b>pressure</b> conditions.

40|$|Salmon lice Lepeophtheirus salmonis Krøyer {{may affect}} {{survival}} {{and growth of}} anadromous salmonids through physiological stress and/or behavioural changes. Using acoustic telemetry tracking, we investigated the behaviour of 30 infected sea trout Salmo trutta throughout the summer in a fjord with very high salmon lice <b>infection</b> <b>pressure.</b> Most of the tracked sea trout adopted a movement pattern expected to suppress salmon lice infestation, as they showed a strong preference for fresh or brackish water, spending {{most of the time}} close to a river outlet or even migrating into the river. Highly infested sea trout preferred shallower depths, associated with lower salinity. The fish lost to predation stayed further away from the river outlet than non-predated fish, and were likely subjected to a stronger <b>infection</b> <b>pressure.</b> Half of the tracked group were treated with a salmon lice prophylaxis, emamectin benzoate. The effect of treatment on infestation was monitored in a separate group held in a sea cage and found to be moderate; the mortality in this group was associated with infestation by motile lice stages. In contrast, treatment was not found to have an effect on tracked fish behaviour. It is likely that some physiological and behavioural responses to high salmon lice <b>infection</b> <b>pressure</b> may be present even after a prophylaxis treatment, in particular when the treatment is given after exposure to salmon lice infection. We conclude that increased salmon lice <b>infection</b> <b>pressure</b> associated with altered salmon farming practice may have the potential to influence the marine behaviour and growth of sea trout.

40|$|AbstractHeart and {{skeletal}} muscle inflammation (HSMI) is an infectious disease causing losses to the Norwegian salmon farming industry {{due to increased}} mortality and high morbidity in infected salmon. The disease is listed as a notifiable disease on list 3 (national list) by the Norwegian Food Safety Authority. HSMI {{is believed to be}} a viral disease, but the association to the recently discovered Piscine reovirus (PRV) remains unclear. Undoubtedly, other factors interact to determine whether PRV-infected fish develop disease or not. In this study, logistic regression was used to model the risk of an outbreak of HSMI at the cohort level, by including spatio-temporal risk factors. The data consisted of fish cohorts grown on geo-referenced farms from 2002 to 2010. The risk factors included were: <b>infection</b> <b>pressure,</b> cohort size (maximum number of fish), cohort index (smolt characteristics), cohort lifespan (months in sea) and a geo-index calculated as the position along a local polynomial regression line based on the longitude and latitude of each farm included in the study. The results showed that the risk of developing HSMI increased with increasing cohort lifespan, increasing <b>infection</b> <b>pressure</b> and increasing cohort size, and was mostly low for cohorts grown on farms in Southern-Norway, high for farms in Mid-Norway and variable for farms in Northern-Norway (based on the geo-index). The final model was used to explore three different scenarios with regards to the risk of developing HSMI, and to calculate the probability for each cohort of developing HSMI, independent of their actual disease-status. The model suggested that the probability of developing HSMI was much higher in Mid-Norway than {{in the rest of the}} country. Even though PRV seems to be widely distributed in the environment, the finding that <b>infection</b> <b>pressure</b> has a large influence on the probability of developing HSMI, suggests that it might be possible to reduce the number of clinical outbreaks, if measures are taken to reduce <b>infection</b> <b>pressure.</b> However, the prospects of controlling the spread of HSMI and reducing clinical outbreaks might be difficult because of indications of large distance spread of the disease...|$|E

40|$|The PAZ Project (People, Animals {{and their}} Zoonosis lead by E. Fevre, [URL] home/Research/paz, {{funded by the}} Wellcome Trust) and its {{consecutive}} projects utilize innovative crossdisciplinary data analysis derived from Numerical Ecology to map, prioritize and deliver interventions against infectious zoonotic diseases in people and their domestic animals. The interventions will be tailored to the risk-driven needs of spatio-temporal clusters. The PAZ Project is undertaking a community based cross sectional survey of humans and their livestock in a mixed crop-livestock farming system in the Lake Victoria Crescent in East Africa. Comprehensive economic, social and disease – including HIV, Malaria, Bovine Tuberculosis, blood and GI parasites – data are collected at the household and individual animal and human level together with prevalence data of six neglected zoonoses. Diseases do not exist in isolation. Ignoring interactions between multiple diseases, co-factors and reservoir species, results in the misinterpretation of <b>infection</b> <b>pressures</b> and miscalculation of effects of interventions. Therefore, designing intervention packages that are specifically targeted to clusters of disease and their co-factors, ensures that the interventions are relevant, targeted and cost-effective. The data from the PAZ Project will be analyzed using (1) Principal Component Analysis (PCA); (2) Cluster Analysis (CA); and finally (3) Bayesian Disease Mapping (BDM) methods. The proposed oral presentation will describe the project and strategic plans for and the preliminary outcomes of the data analysis...|$|R
