500|$|Immediately after <b>Decision</b> <b>Time</b> a [...] "Members Debate" [...] is held, which {{lasts for}} 45 minutes. Members Business {{is a debate}} on a motion {{proposed}} by an MSP {{who is not a}} Scottish minister. Such motions are on issues which may be of interest to a particular area such as a member's own constituency, an upcoming or past event or any other item which would otherwise not be accorded official parliamentary time. As well as the proposer, other members normally contribute to the debate. The relevant minister, whose department the debate and motion relate to [...] "winds up" [...] the debate by speaking after all other participants.|$|E
500|$|Each sitting day, {{normally}} at 5pm, MSPs {{decide on}} all the motions and amendments that have been moved that day. This [...] "Decision Time" [...] is heralded by the sounding of the division bell, which is heard throughout the Parliamentary campus and alerts MSPs {{who are not in}} the chamber to return and vote. At <b>Decision</b> <b>Time,</b> the Presiding Officer puts questions on the motions and amendments by reading out the name of the motion or amendment as well as the proposer and asking [...] "Are we all agreed?", to which the chamber first votes orally. If there is audible dissent, the Presiding Officer announces [...] "There will be a division" [...] and members vote by means of electronic consoles on their desks. Each MSP has a unique access card with a microchip which, when inserted into the console, identifies them and allows them to vote. As a result, the outcome of each division is known in seconds.|$|E

2500|$|On August 30, 1937, after a {{postponement}} of {{four days}} due to rain, Louis and Farr finally touched gloves at New York's Yankee Stadium before {{a crowd of}} approximately 32,000. Louis fought {{one of the hardest}} battles of his life. The bout was closely contested and went the entire 15 rounds, with Louis being unable to knock Farr down. Referee Arthur Donovan was even seen shaking Farr's hand after the bout, in apparent congratulation. Nevertheless, after the score was announced, Louis had won a controversial unanimous <b>decision.</b> <b>Time</b> described the scene thus: [...] "After collecting the judges' votes, referee Arthur Donovan announced that Louis had won the fight on points. The crowd of 50,000...amazed that Farr had not been knocked out or even knocked down, booed the decision." ...|$|E
2500|$|Each {{team has}} its representatives attend the draft. During the draft, one team is always [...] "on the clock." [...] In Round 1, teams have 10 minutes {{to make their}} choice (previously 15). The <b>{{decision}}</b> <b>time</b> drops to 7 minutes (previously 10) {{in the second round}} and 5 minutes in Rounds 3–7. If a team does not make a decision within its allotted time, the team still can submit its selection at any time after its time is up, but the next team can pick before it, thus possibly 'stealing' a player the team with the earlier pick may have been considering. This occurred in the 2003 draft, when the Minnesota Vikings, with the 7th overall pick, were late with their selection. The Jacksonville Jaguars drafted quarterback Byron Leftwich and the Carolina Panthers drafted offensive tackle Jordan Gross before the Vikings were able to submit their selection of defensive tackle Kevin Williams. [...] This also happened in 2011; as the Baltimore Ravens were negotiating a trade with the Chicago Bears, their time expired and allowed the Kansas City Chiefs to pick ahead of Baltimore, who was unable to finalize the trade with Chicago.|$|E

40|$|We present novel {{evidence}} on <b>decision</b> <b>times</b> and personality traits in standard {{questions from the}} decision-making literature where responses are relatively slow (medians around half a minute or above). To this end, we measured <b>decision</b> <b>times</b> {{in a number of}} incentivized, framed items (decisions from description) including the Cognitive Reflection Test, two additional questions following the same logic, and a number of classic questions used to study decision biases in probability judgments (base-rate neglect, the conjunction fallacy, and the ratio bias). All questions create a conflict between an intuitive process and more deliberative thinking. For each item, we then created a non-conflict version by either making the intuitive impulse correct (resulting in an alignment question), shutting it down (creating a neutral question), or making it dominant (creating a heuristic question). For CRT questions, the differences in <b>decision</b> <b>times</b> are as predicted by dual-process theories, with alignment and heuristic variants leading to faster responses and neutral questions to slower responses than the original, conflict questions. For decision biases (where responses are slower), evidence is mixed. To explore the possible influence of personality factors on both choices and <b>decision</b> <b>times,</b> we used standard personality scales including the Rational-Experiential Inventory and the Big Five, and used the mas controls in regression analysis...|$|R
40|$|We {{assess the}} amount of shared {{variance}} between three measures of visual word recognition latencies: eye movement latencies, lexical <b>decision</b> <b>times</b> and naming times. After partialling out the effects of word frequency and word length, two well-documented predictors of word recognition latencies, we see that 7 - 44 % of the variance is uniquely shared between lexical <b>decision</b> <b>times</b> and naming times, depending on the frequency range of the words used. A similar analysis of eye movement latencies shows {{that the percentage of}} variance they uniquely share either with lexical <b>decision</b> <b>times</b> or with naming times is much lower. It is 5 – 17 % for gaze durations and lexical <b>decision</b> <b>times</b> in studies with target words presented in neutral sentences, but drops to. 2 % for corpus studies in which eye movements to all words are analysed. Correlations between gaze durations and naming latencies are lower still. These findings suggest that processing times in isolated word processing and continuous text reading are affected by specific task demands and presentation format, and that lexical <b>decision</b> <b>times</b> and naming times are not very informative in predicting eye movement latencies in text reading once the effect of word frequency and word length are taken into account. The difference between controlled experiments and natural reading suggests that reading strategies and stimulus materials may determine {{the degree to which the}} immediacy-of-processing assumption and the eye-mind assumption apply. Fixation times are more likely to exclusively reflect the lexical processing of the currently fixated word in controlled studies with unpredictable target words rather than in natural reading of sentences or texts...|$|R

40|$|Background Publishing in {{scientific}} journals {{is one of}} the most important ways in which scientists disseminate research to their peers and to the wider public. Pre-publication peer review underpins this process, but peer review is subject to various criticisms and is under pressure from growth in the number of scientific publications.   Methods Here we examine an element of the editorial process at eLife, in which the Reviewing Editor usually serves as one of the referees, to see what effect this has on <b>decision</b> <b>times,</b> <b>decision</b> type, and the number of citations. We analysed a dataset of 8, 905 research submissions to eLife since June 2012, of which 2, 747 were sent for peer review. This subset of 2747 papers was then analysed in detail.     Results The Reviewing Editor serving as one of the peer reviewers results in faster <b>decision</b> <b>times</b> on average, with the <b>time</b> to final <b>decision</b> ten days faster for accepted submissions (n= 1, 405) and five days faster for papers that were rejected after peer review (n= 1, 099). Moreover, editors acting as reviewers had no effect on whether submissions were accepted or rejected, and a very small (but significant) effect on citation rates.   Conclusions An important aspect of eLife’s peer-review process is shown to be effective, given that <b>decision</b> <b>times</b> are faster when the Reviewing Editor serves as a reviewer. Other journals hoping to improve <b>decision</b> <b>times</b> could consider adopting a similar approach...|$|R
40|$|During a lexical {{decision}} task, lexical {{decision making}} {{can be distinguished}} from lexical retrieval. Lexical decision making is independent of stimulus modality and not reflected in the <b>decision</b> <b>times,</b> whereas the opposite holds for lexical retrieval. In neuroimaging studies investigating lexical decision tasks with either visual or auditory stimuli these two processes have so far been confused. Therefore, {{it is not clear}} whether the activation of Broca's region, consisting of the left Brodmann's area (BA) 44 and BA 45, reported in such studies really reflects lexical decision making. The present event-related fMRI study investigated the role of Broca's region in lexical decision by analyzing brain activation that is independent of stimulus modality or <b>decision</b> <b>times.</b> Twenty-two healthy participants performed lexical decisions on visual and auditory real words and pseudo-words. The left BA 44 was conjointly activated during visual and auditory lexical decisions as compared to rest indicating the modality-independent involvement of BA 44 in lexical decision tasks in general. To identify brain activation related to lexical decision making rather than lexical retrieval the <b>decision</b> <b>times</b> were entered as covariates into the fMRI analysis. In this analysis, the left BA 44 was activated for visual and for auditory lexical decision making. These results indicate that the left BA 44 as a distinct sub-part of Broca's region plays an important role in lexical decision making independently of stimulus modality and <b>decision</b> <b>times...</b>|$|R
40|$|In two crossmodal lexical {{decision}} experiments {{we investigated}} {{the time course of}} idiomatic meaning activation for Italian participants listening to spoken idioms. Participants were grouped into fast and slow {{groups on the}} basis of their speed of correct response to visually presented targets associated with idioms that were auditorily presented. Participants whose mean lexical <b>decision</b> <b>times</b> were below the 45 th percentile were considered slow participants and those whose mean lexical <b>decision</b> <b>times</b> were above the 55 th percentile were considered fast participants. The results of Experiment 1 showed that slow and fast participants decided equally quickly the lexical status of the target words associated with predictable idioms. In contrast, whereas the slow participants responded to target words presented during predictable idioms more quickly than to target words presented during nonpredictable idioms, the fast participants responded equally quickly to targets presented during predictable and nonpredictable idioms. When a response deadline was introduced (Experiment 2), fast and slow participants activated the idiomatic meaning of nonpredictable idioms equally quickly, as reflected by the lexical <b>decision</b> <b>times</b> for the target words associated with idioms of this type. The results are interpreted in the light of current models of spoken idiom comprehension...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the generation of emotional inferences during the reading and recall of narrative texts. Experiment 1 compared the fit of two simulations of text comprehension to the recall data. One simulation examined causal and referential inferences, while the other examined causal, referential and emotional inferences. We found that the simulation that involved emotional inferences provided a better fit to the human data than the other simulation. Experiment 2 tested whether emotional inferences are generated online by recording lexical <b>decision</b> <b>times</b> at pre-inference and inference locations. Lexical <b>decision</b> <b>times</b> were faster at the inference than the pre-inference locations. These findings suggest that emotional inferences {{play a role in}} the understanding of natural texts, and that they require the reader to establish connections between text segments...|$|R
40|$|We {{employ a}} natural method from the {{perspective}} of the optimal stopping theory to analyze entry-exit decisions with implementation delay of a project, and provide closed expressions for optimal entry <b>decision</b> <b>times,</b> optimal exit <b>decision</b> <b>times</b> and the maximal expected present value from the project. The results in conventional research were obtained under the restriction that the sum of the entry cost and the exit cost is nonnegative. In practice, we usually meet this sum is negative, so it is necessary to remove the restriction. If the sum is negative, there may exist two price triggers of entry decision, which does not happen when the sum is nonnegative, and it is not optimal to enter and then immediately exit the project even though it is an arbitrage opportunity...|$|R
40|$|The spike {{activity}} of cells in some cortical areas {{has been found}} to be correlated with reaction times and behavioral responses during two-choice decision tasks. These experimental findings have motivated the study of biologically plausible winner-take-all network models, in which strong recurrent excitation and feedback inhibition allow the network to form a categorical choice upon stimulation. Choice formation corresponds in these models to the transition from the spontaneous state of the network to a state where neurons selective for one of the choices fire at a high rate and inhibit the {{activity of}} the other neurons. This transition has been traditionally induced by an increase in the external input that destabilizes the spontaneous state of the network and forces its relaxation to a decision state. Here we explore a different mechanism by which the system can undergo such transitions while keeping the spontaneous state stable, based on an escape induced by finite-size noise from the spontaneous state. This decision mechanism naturally arises for low stimulus strengths and leads to exponentially distributed <b>decision</b> <b>times</b> when the amount of noise in the system is small. Furthermore, we show using numerical simulations that mean <b>decision</b> <b>times</b> follow in this regime an exponential dependence on the amplitude of noise. The escape mechanism provides thus a dynamical basis for the wide range and variability of <b>decision</b> <b>times</b> observe...|$|R

We began by developing a model of domain constraints for the generic vehicle routing problem, in order to characterize planners' constraint processing and assess the visibility of constraints on different routing interfaces. An experiment featuring vehicle routing problems was then designed to test interfaces reflecting technological changes, including automation leading to simplified interfaces and the display of multiple routes computed by algorithms. Twelve participants {{who had worked for}} a small transport company for nine months were exposed to all these interfaces. Mental workload, performance and decision-making times were measured. Results revealed that automation decreases mental workload and <b>decision</b> <b>times,</b> attributable to the abridged (vs. unabridged) display of constraints on the interface.

In other words, it is the price that one expects for the security would have over the execution horizon if the order were not executed. To estimate the cost of an execution strategy, market impact must be added to the impact-free price. It is well worth stressing that attempts to estimate the cost of alternative schedules without impact adjustments are counter-productive: high urgency strategies would capture more liquidity near the <b>decision</b> <b>time</b> and therefore would always be preferred if one did not account for their impact. In fact, front-loaded execution schedules have a higher average impact cost.|$|E
