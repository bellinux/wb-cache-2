60|$|Thorax and Abdomen.--When the {{external}} integument is cut open, the thorax (Pl. V, fig. 13) is found lodged within an <b>inner</b> <b>sack</b> or rather tube, extending from {{near the bottom}} of the animal, up to {{the external}} orifice. The whole thorax is sometimes forced through the orifice, owing perhaps to the action of the spirits of wine and consequent endosmose, and is thus well displayed without dissection. The thorax tapers a little, is much flattened and straight; its length, together with the terminal abdominal lobe, is about 6/400ths of an inch; it is formed of very thin, most finely hirsute membrane, transversely wrinkled and so extensible, that when everted by the internal muscles being seized, it stretches to twice its former length; in this condition, five transverse articulations are displayed. The abdominal lobe is smooth, and cannot be stretched, or turned inside out by pulling the above muscles. On the thorax, corresponding with the interspaces between the five transverse articulations, there are four pair of short limbs, but their bases, I believe, are prolonged across the inner or ventral surface of the thorax, so as almost to touch each other. These limbs, I believe, have no articulations, except, perhaps, where united to the thorax. The anterior or lowest limb, on each side, supports two or sometimes only a single spine; this pair is rather smaller than the second, and is placed a little more distant from it, than are the upper pairs from each other. The second pair differs from the upper two, only in having its three spines a very little shorter. The two upper or posterior pair exactly resemble each other; each has two spines on the summit, and a third seated lower down, on a little notch on the outer side, but with its point on a level with the others. The points of the spines of the two upper limbs, stand on a level with the external spines at the end of the abdomen. All the spines are of excessive tenuity and sharpness; they are straight, long, and not plumose.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{interesting}} characters assisting Count Carl Gustav von Rosen was Lynn Garrison, an ex-RCAF fighter pilot. He introduced the Count to a Canadian method of dropping bagged supplies to remote areas in Canada without losing the contents. He showed how one sack of food could be placed inside a larger sack before the supply drop. When the package hit the ground the <b>inner</b> <b>sack</b> would rupture while the outer one kept the contents intact. With this method many tons of food were dropped to many Biafrans who would otherwise have died of starvation.|$|E
50|$|Despite his {{controversial}} methods, Count von Rosen {{would later be}} remembered for his efforts to modernize relief efforts to remote conflict zones. One of the notable figures assisting Count Carl Gustav von Rosen was Lynn Garrison, an ex-RCAF fighter pilot.

With this method many tons of food were dropped to many Biafrans who would otherwise have died of starvation. Later models of the Malm√∂ Flygindustri MFI-9 became the SAAB MFI-15 Safari, with official modifications, developed from the Biafran concept, to facilitate the dropping of food supplies from underwing hard points. Von Rosen was utilizing this type in Ogaden {{when he was killed}} during a rebel ground assault.|$|E

25|$|In the 18th century, {{the last}} {{phase of the}} kingdom arrived. The Bamar people, who had taken control of Lan Na and had also unified their kingdom under the {{powerful}} Konbaung Dynasty, launched several blows against Ayutthaya in the 1750s and 1760s. Finally, in 1767, after several months of siege, the Burmese broke through Ayutthaya's outer and <b>inner</b> walls, <b>sacked</b> the city, and burned it down. The royal family fled the city and Ayutthaya's last king, Ekkathat, died of starvation ten days later while in hiding.|$|R
5000|$|The {{story has}} an outer narrator who {{receives}} the story by <b>Sack,</b> the <b>inner</b> narrator. <b>Sack</b> is the impresario of Bachmann, {{but he is}} callous, and does not care for him. The core story deals with the love relationship between Mme. Perov and Bachmann. Bachmann is an awkward and eccentric pianist and composer to whom she is introduced at a party where she (like the reader) first mistakes Sack for Bachmann. Sack speaks disparagingly of B, who has [...] "no brains". Sack has to track him down frequently as he being an alcoholic tends to disappear before his performances. Mme Perov becomes a necessary and enhancing facilitator for the musical genius; he always made sure that {{she was sitting in}} the first row when he was performing. One night, when she was sick and absent, Bachmann refused to play and insulted the audience (Sack complained that he was showing them [...] "the fig - instead of the fugue"). Sack dragged her out of her bed to the theatre, but Bachmann had left already. Sack made her look for Bachmann in a cold and rainy night, and when she finally returned to the hotel, she found Bachmann in the room. The outer narrator describes their togetherness: [...] "I think that these two, the deranged musician and the dying woman, that night found words the greatest poets never dreamed of". She died the next day. Bachmann disappeared after the funeral and became insane. Sack saw him later in a deplorable state and avoided him.|$|R
