5000|$|Nontarget {{effects on}} some insects (predatory and detritivorous beetles, some {{parasitic}} wasps and bees) {{were also found}} in field trials of fipronil for desert locust control in Mauritania, and very low doses (0.6-2.0 g a.i./ha) used against grasshoppers in Niger caused impacts on nontarget insects comparable to those found with other insecticides used in grasshopper control. The implications of this for other wildlife and ecology of the habitat remain unknown, but appear unlikely to be severe. Unfortunately, this lack of severity was not observed in bee species in South America. Fipronil is also used in Brazil and studies on the stingless bee Scaptotrigona postica have shown adverse reactions to the pesticide, including seizures, paralysis, and death with a lethal dose of [...]54 ng a.i./bee and a lethal concentration of [...]24 ng a.i./μl diet.

50|$|Vespula germanica (European wasp, <b>German</b> <b>wasp,</b> or German yellowjacket) is {{a species}} of wasp found {{in much of the}} Northern Hemisphere, native to Europe, Northern Africa, and {{temperate}} Asia. It has been introduced and is well-established in many other places, including North America, South America (Argentina and Chile), Australia, and New Zealand.

50|$|The <b>German</b> <b>wasp</b> {{is about}} 13 mm (0.5 in) long, has {{a mass of}} 74.1 ± 9.6 mg, and has typical wasp colours of black and yellow.

German wasps also have black dots on their abdomens, while the common wasp's {{analogous}} markings are fused with the black rings above them, forming a different pattern. However, the identification of a wasp as V. vulgaris might be difficult because the normally unbroken black mark on its clypeus can sometimes appear broken, making it look extremely similar to V. germanica.|$|E
50|$|Along {{with the}} closely related common wasp and {{two species of}} Polistes, the <b>German</b> <b>wasp</b> is {{considered}} to be a pest in New Zealand. It was probably introduced in the late 19th century, but did not appear in large numbers until around 1940. Wasp numbers reach their greatest densities in beech forest of the South Island, due to the abundance of honeydew produced by the beech scale insect in this type of forest. It has a serious effect on the forest ecology, since less honeydew remains available for the native birds. German wasps were, however, quickly succeeded in much of the South Island and its beech forests by the introduction of the common wasp in the 1970s.|$|E
5000|$|The {{introduction}} to New Zealand of the <b>German</b> <b>wasp</b> (Vespula germanica) {{and the common}} wasp (Vespula vulgaris) has severely impacted on native New Zealand species. Beech forests of New Zealand, like those of Victoria Forest Park, are infested with scale insects that excrete a sugary secretion. Wasps compete with the native nectar feeding birds and insects, for this sugary secretion, thereby {{reducing the amount of}} honeydew that would otherwise be available. [...] Within the beech forests of New Zealand, the biomass of wasps are estimated to be greater than the combined biomass of birds, rodents and stoats and it is estimated that they reduce the honeydew resource by >90% as well as having a major predation impact on native invertebrates.|$|E
5000|$|Bees and hornets often {{seek out}} natural {{cavities}} {{in which to}} construct their nests, also known as hives, in which they store food and raise their young. Other species of bee and some wasps dig holes in the ground or chew through wood. In the species Megachile rotundata, for example, females construct tubular-shaped nests in rotting wood as well as small holes in the ground, creating, each cell made from circular disks cut from plant leaves using the bee's mandibles. Bee nests are founded upon the wax the secrete from their bodies, while those of wasps are dependent {{on their ability to}} turn plant water into paper using their saliva. [...] Nests often exhibit divided living, with eggs and food stores kept in distinct parts of the hive. [...] Vespid wasps build complex nests from paper-like material where they lay eggs in individual cells. When the young hatch, their parents feed them chewed up larvae. Different species exhibit different nest structures. Paper wasp nesting consist of a single tier of cells, while yellow jacket nests can be many layers thick, reaching up to 30 cm in diameter. [...] Nesting strategies can be plastic, for instance the wasp Parischnogaster mellyi will significant vary its nest construction based on environmental conditions, and the wasp Mischocyttarus mexicanus is known to nest in groups or alone depending on the distribution of potential nest sites in the area. [...] Nest sizes vary dramatically and the largest wasp nest on record measured 1.75 m in diameter and was 3.7 m tall. Found in New Zealand, it was likely built by the <b>German</b> <b>wasp.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>German</b> <b>wasp</b> (Vespula germanica) {{and common}} wasp (v. vulgaris) colonies were studied in {{urban and rural}} {{habitats}} in Manawatu, from January to August 1993. Relative abundance of colonies, nest site preferences, colony dynamics, phenology and diet are described. Data quantifying vespulid wasp nest abundance in Manawatu between 1991 - 1994 were sourced from pest control companies and the Manawatu-Wanganui Regional Council. These data were compared with rainfall records for the same period. Over 75 % of nests examined in urban and rural Manawatu were built by common wasps. This trend persisted through the season with German wasps accounting {{for no more than}} 28 % of nests reported in any one month. Most reports of wasps were made in January, with February and March also being high. Heavy rainfall in spring appeared to promote colony formation in the following year. Continued high rainfall between January-June, especially over 600 mm appeared, however, to suppress colonies during this time. Nest drowning is a possible reason for this. Different nest site preferences between the two species were evident in urban and rural habitats. Over half of all urban common wasp nests and a third of urban <b>German</b> <b>wasp</b> nests reported were in sites associated with buildings. Nests in such sites grow faster and larger than those in other sites. In contrast, all rural <b>German</b> <b>wasp</b> nests and 85 % of rural common wasp nests were built in the ground. The invasion of Manawatu by common wasps {{does not appear to have}} modified the nest site preferences of German wasps. Seasonal traffic rates for both species were similar, with colonies peaking in late March. Common wasp traffic rates were significantly higher in January-February, probably because of earlier nest initiations. Prior to queen production common wasp colonies were most active in the early afternoon. Around the time of queen production early evening activity increased, possibly as a result of the seasonal decrease in day length. Nests with high numbers of worker/male cells built before male production began produced significantly more queens than those with fewer cells. Although similar in size to <b>German</b> <b>wasp</b> nests, common wasp nests contained more queen cells. Cell weights differed between the castes and species. <b>German</b> <b>wasp</b> nests therefore required more than twice as much effort to build as a common wasp nest of a similar size. The possible competitive effects of such differences are discussed. Manawatu <b>German</b> <b>wasp</b> colonies appear to produce males earlier (early February) than common wasp colonies (early March). The reverse applies to queen production which may have started earlier (March 12) in common wasp colonies than in <b>German</b> <b>wasp</b> colonies (March 20). However, variation within and between the species does occur. The egg laying ability of the founder queen appears to limit oviposition in worker/male cells but the availability of empty queen cells appears to limit oviposition in queen cells. The size of the worker force limits the number of larvae that can be cared for. Reproductives were seen leaving nests from early May and continued until the colonies died. In an overwintering <b>German</b> <b>wasp</b> nest production of all three castes were at levels equivalent to an annual nest at peak. <b>German</b> <b>wasp</b> foragers returned with a higher percentage of protein items (16 %) than common wasp foragers (11 %). Similar percentages of woodpulp were returned to colonies by both species. Diptera, Lepidoptera. Araneae, and Hemiptera were the main animal prey returned to urban and rural colonies. <b>German</b> <b>wasp</b> foragers returned with prey items that were significantly heavier than those carried by common wasps but woodpulp weight did not differ. However, common wasp colonies killed more invertebrates to meet their needs, suggesting that they represent a substantial threat to invertebrate communities. Both prey provision and woodpulp foraging increased dramatically with the onset of queen rearing, indicating the increased needs of colonies at this time. The ecological significance of woodpulp foraging on both species is discussed. Key areas for future wasp research that are applicable within Manawatu and more widely in New Zealand, are outlined. Main areas needing investigation concern aspects of colony dynamics and phenology...|$|E
40|$|The {{parasitoid}} beetle Metoecus paradoxus frequently parasitizes {{colonies of}} the common wasp, Vespula vulgaris. It penetrates a host colony as a larva that attaches itself onto a foraging wasp's body and, once inside the nest, it feeds on a wasp larva inside a brood cell and then pupates. Avoiding detection by the wasp host is crucial when the beetle emerges. Here, we tested whether adult M. paradoxus beetles avoid detection by mimicking the cuticular hydrocarbon profile of their host. The beetles appear to be chemically adapted to their main host species, the common wasp, because they share more hydrocarbon compounds with it than they do with the related <b>German</b> <b>wasp,</b> V. germanica. In addition, aggression tests showed that adult beetles were attacked less by common wasp workers than by <b>German</b> <b>wasp</b> workers. Our results further indicated that the host-specific compounds were, at least partially, produced through recycling of the prey's hydrocarbons, and were not acquired through contact with the adult host. Moreover, the chemical profile of the beetles shows overproduction of the wasp queen pheromone, nonacosane (n-C 29), suggesting that beetles might mimic the queen's pheromonal bouquet. status: publishe...|$|E

They are also able to recognize a shape irrespective of color and contrast with the background. Our study shows that this species is able to detect patterns and their orientation in the dorsal field, ability that is lacking in honeybees.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze current {{evidence}} regarding allergy to Hymenoptera venoms. Brief review: The Hymenoptera species, which are most important in the context of venom allergy, include the common wasp (Vespula vulgaris), <b>German</b> <b>wasp</b> (Vespula germanica), and the honey bee (Apis mellifera). Depending on the population, systemic allergic reactions occur in 1. 5 – 8. 9 % of cases. Every year, anaphylactic reactions cause about 40 deaths in the United States and approximately 100 deaths in Europe. Although venoms of various insects differ in terms of their antigen composition, they can show cross-reactivity. Allergic reactions are classified as local or systemic. The IgE-dependent reaction constitutes the most frequent mechanisms responsible for insect venom hypersensitivity. Diagnosis of hypersensitivity is mostly based on history and positive results of skin tests and/or the presence of specific IgE in serum. Intramuscular injection of adrenaline is the procedure of choice in the case of anaphylactic reaction. Immunotherapy has an established the efficacy in the prevention of an anaphylactic reaction in individuals who are sensitive to Hymenoptera venoms. At present, recombinant antigens are being studied in order to improve the safety and effectiveness of diagnosis and therapy. Conclusion: Hymenoptera venom allergy is a subject of extensive research.

40|$|In some ants, bees, and wasps, workers kill or "police" male eggs laid {{by other}} workers {{in order to}} {{maintain}} the reproductive primacy of the queen. Kin selection theory predicts that multiple mating by the queen is one factor that can selectively favor worker policing. This is because when the queen is mated to multiple males, workers are more closely related to the queen’s sons than to the sons of other workers. Earlier work has suggested that reproductive patterns in the <b>German</b> <b>wasp</b> Vespula germanica may contradict this theory, because in some colonies a large fraction of the adult males were inferred to be the workers’ sons, despite the effective queen mating frequency being greater than 2 (2. 4). In the present study, we reexamine the V. germanica case and show that it does support the theory. First, genetic analysis confirms that the effective queen mating frequency is high, 2. 9, resulting in workers being more related to the queen’s sons than to other workers’ sons. Second, behavioral assays show that worker-laid eggs are effectively killed by other workers, despite worker-laid eggs having the same intrinsic viability as queen-laid ones. Finally, we estimate that approximately 58. 4 % of the male eggs but only 0. 44 % of the adult males are worker derived in queenright colonies, consistent with worker reproduction being effectively policed. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Insect {{societies}} {{are well known}} for their cooperation. However, a number of conflicts do occur within their colonies. The eusocial Hymenoptera (bees, ants and wasps) are no exception, with several reproductive conflicts affecting their societies. One of these conflicts is over male production. This conflict {{is caused by the}} fact that the workers in most species, though unable to mate, possess functional ovaries and retain the capacity to lay unfertilized, male eggs. In addition, since both the mother queen and the workers are each most related to their own sons, they would be expected to strongly compete over male production. One important mechanism that can resolve this conflict is policing, whereby workers are prevented to successfully reproduce, thereby maintaining the reproductive primacy of the queen. Policing can be carried out by both the mother queen (queen policing), and by the workers (worker policing), and can occur either via aggression or selective egg eating. In this thesis, we examined the ultimate causes and underlying proximate mechanism that enable worker policing by egg eating in Vespinae wasps. In a first set of studies, we looked at the importance of the relatedness among workers as an ultimate cause for the selection of worker policing in three species of Vespinae wasps, the <b>German</b> <b>wasp</b> Vespula germanica, the Norwegian wasp Dolichovespula norwegica and the Saxon wasp Dolichovespula saxonica. Our data show that patterns of policing can be surprisingly complex. In particular, different evolutionary factors, including relatedness, as well as effects on colony productivity and the sex ratio, are not mutually exclusive and need to be considered together to explain prevailing patterns of worker policing in eusocial Hymenoptera. In addition, we provide evidence for the occurrence of selfish worker policing in D. norwegica. In this type of policing, workers carrying out the policing also occasionally lay eggs themselves, thereby acquiring direct fitness benefits. This finding supports selfish worker policing to be an important mechanism that can greatly facilitate the evolution of worker policing. Inclusive fitness theory and empirical data suggest that in eusocial hymenopteran species where colonies are either headed by a single mated queen or a multiple mated queen, workers should police other workers' eggs only in colonies headed by a multiple mated queen. Despite earlier evidence for facultative worker policing in Dolichovespula saxonica by Foster and Ratnieks (2000), we found no evidence for facultative worker policing but show that seasonal progression of the nest and the location in the nest where males were reared explain the patterns of worker reproduction. Furthermore, we showthat chemical variability in cuticular hydrocarbon profiles among the workers was not significantly correlated with queen mating frequency and, therefore, is likely not used by workers to facultatively police according to the queen mating frequency. Our results suggest that the earlier evidence for facultative worker policing in D. saxonica by Foster and Ratnieks (2000) may have been due to accidental correlations with certain confounding variables, or, alternatively, that there are large interpopulation differences in the expression of worker policing. In another study, we looked at the proximate mechanism that enables workers to selectively police worker-laid eggs. We demonstrate that in the common wasp Vespula vulgaris, surface hydrocarbon profiles of queen-laid eggs and worker-laid eggs can contain the necessary information for workers to effectively police worker-laid eggs. Finally, in a last chapter, our data suggest that the beetle, Metoecus paradoxus, which is known to parasitize Vespula vulgaris colonies, can elude host recognition in the adult stage by mimicking the wasps&# 8223; cuticular hydrocarbon profiles. This study is the first to show chemical mimicry by a non-social insect parasitizing social wasp colonies.

40|$|Vespula germanica (F.) (<b>German</b> <b>wasp)</b> and V. vulgaris (L.) (common wasp) {{are major}} pests in New Zealand. They damage crops, have a {{significant}} impact on the biodiversity of native ecosystems and present a significant health hazard by stinging people and animals. Efforts to control them, both chemically and biologically, have not been as effective as initially hoped. This research contributes to a larger programme studying the potential of entomopathogenic microbes for the control of German and common wasps in New Zealand. This study has demonstrated the potential and limitations which exist for control of wasps using microbial pathogens. Effective pathogens were identified and disease transmission quantified in bioassays. Behavioural and physiological adaptations of wasps were investigated as resistance mechanisms to disease. Three species of fungi (Beauveria bassiana, Aspergillus flavus and Metarhizium anisopliae) were identified as having potential to kill workers and larvae and severely disrupt the colony. In laboratory trials, fungi and bacteria were readily transmitted between workers and larvae and among workers. Workers and larvae, individually, possess few resistance mechanisms capable of suppressing a mass infection of pathogenic fungi. No tested bacteria were pathogenic to adult wasps. Although B. bassiana was extremely pathogenic in bioassays, behavioural adaptations of wasp workers and larvae restricted proliferation of fungi in a healthy nest. Anomalies in behaviour when removing sporulating or infectious cadavers indicate a 'window-of-opportunity' for the dissemination of disease if the fungus could achieve maturity. However, getting sufficient inoculum into the nest and achieving widespread sporulation to establish an epizootic will be a significant challenge. All of the bacteria tested were susceptible to antibiotics in larval saliva, and therefore not significantly pathogenic to wasps. Significant inhibitory effects of venom against A. flavus were identified, but no evidence of its use in the nest could be found. A more cryptic and infectious disease, such as a bacterium or microsporidian, holds the greatest potential for future control efforts. It is apparent that, in order to establish an infection capable of developing into an epizootic in wasp nests, a microbe needs to be gradually invasive, readily transmitted, a prolific replicator, cryptic and have little impact on host behaviour leading up to maturation. Limitations to the current use of pathogens for wasp control may be overcome by strain selection and development of delivery systems. Pathogens have the potential to complement and enhance existing biological control programmes, but much research is needed to realise this potential...|$|E
40|$|New Zealand was colonised by the <b>German</b> <b>wasp,</b> Vespula germanica (F.) in the 1940 s and {{it became}} {{established}} throughout the country, The common wasp, V. vulgaris (L) colonised in the late 1970 s and is still expanding its range. Wasps are now common in honeydew beech forests of the South Island and can reach high densities. The behaviour and ecology of V. vulgaris and V. germanica were studied from 1988 to 1991 to investigate competitive interactions in honeydew beech forests of the north-western South Island. v: germanica disappeared from areas of honeydew beech forest within 3 - 5 years of the first arrival of v: vulgaris and has not returned to them. A change in the relative abundance of the two species occurred in spring following the arrival of V. vulgaris, and {{was consistent with the}} predictions of Archer's (1985) model of wasp population fluctuation. In north-western South Island honeydew beech forests where both species occur, the more abundant species dominates honeydew trunks. Aggressive interactions may take place on this high quality, potentially defensible sugar resource. The two wasp species show different foraging patterns that provide the potential for local coexistence. Although both are generalist feeders, v: germanica is more commonly found foraging for protein amongst the forest litter, whereas v: vulgaris forages more on shrubs and tree saplings. Approximately 15 % of foragers returning to sampled nests carried animal prey. The proportion of protein in the diets of wasps decreased sharply after rain. V. germanica collected more Orthoptera and large Hymenoptera, whereas V. VUlgaris collected more Hemiptera and Lepidoptera. An estimated 0. 8 and 4. 8 million prey loads, or 1. 4 and 8. 1 kg per hectare per year was taken into nests in western and northern South Island honeydew beech forests, respectively. Wasp foraging and rainfall reduced the honeydew standing crop. As standing crop decreased, more wasps occurred on honeydew trees, they became less active, spent more time lapping the tree surface, and fed at a slower rate. v: vulgaris was more active and fed more efficiently than v: germanica. Variation in queen size was found between wasp colonies and sites. Small queens were present in juvenile queen populations but were under represented in the reproductive population suggesting that small queens have a lower probability of survival. A conceptual model of population regulation and species replacement involving an overcompensating control mechanism is presented. Variation in queen quality is a consequence of differential larval nutrition in autumn when the food resource fluctuates with changes in wasp density and environmental conditions. The competitive advantage that V. vulgaris has in harvesting honeydew means that foragers spend less time obtaining carbohydrate and more time meeting larval food demands. This increases the relative fitness of V. vulgaris queens, and results in V. vulgaris densities increasing relative to those of V. gennanica. Eventually, V. gennanica is eliminated from patches of honeydew beech forest...|$|E

Although the individuals of the colony cooperate and workers {{are known for}} their altruistic behaviour, there is a conflict between queen and workers over male production, since in most species of social Hymenoptera workers retain functional ovaries and are thus capable to lay unfertilized male eggs. In order to solve this potential reproductive conflict, social insects require an effective communication system to keep the harmony. Cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) protect insects against desiccation, but have been co-opted in several communicative functions including nestmate recognition, sex pheromones and to signal fertility and dominance status. Queen pheromones are queen-produced chemicals that signal her presence and potentially her fertility, inducing worker sterility and policing behaviour, and are thought to {{play a key role in}} the resolution of reproductive conflict. In this thesis, I focused on the study of queen pheromones in the family of the Vespidae wasps. The aim was to test the hypothesis that a common pheromone signalling pathway underlies reproductive division of labour in different species, by identifying and comparing the active queen pheromones. This was done by measuring differences in CHCs between reproductive and sterile females by gas-chromatography-mass-spectrometry (GC-MS) and conducting worker-reproduction or worker-policing bioassays to test their efficacy. Firstly, I found that the same signals are used by queens of the common wasp (Vespula vulgaris) to directly signal her presence and to mark and protect her eggs, thus allowing workers to perform policing behaviour, which is an additional mechanism to keep the queen’s reproductive dominance. Furthermore, a blend of CHCs that were very similar to the queen pheromones of V. vulgaris and characteristic of queens of the Saxon wasp (Dolichovespula saxonica) as well, significantly reduced worker ovary development in the latter. However, a similar experiment with another highly eusocial species, the <b>German</b> <b>wasp</b> (Vespula germanica), did not show a similar reduction in ovary development, but a strong significant effect of colony size was observed, which may have clouded the effects of pheromones. This shows that these experiments may have to be repeated, standardizing the colonies to not have such an effect. Next, in the primitively eusocial wasp Polistes satan (Polistinae), chemical cues are used only secondarily to avoid conflict, but other mechanisms such as aggression and visual cues are necessary to establish the reproductive division of labour in the nest. Nonetheless, the differences in CHCs between reproductive females and workers are similar to those found in the highly eusocial vespines, suggesting that the chemical cues were already present in a primitively eusocial ancestor but were not used as signals. Lastly, the CHCs analyses in the solitary wasp Monobia quadridens showed a higher amount of alkenes in reproductive females compared to males which could indicate a potential for sex pheromones. In conclusion, queen pheromones probably evolved from by-products of ovary development, since I found a large degree of conservation amongst queen-specific compounds: specific linear alkanes and methyl-branched hydrocarbons are characteristic of queens and other dominant females. Future studies should focus on the evolution of queen pheromones in a phylogenetic context, or expression differences in the enzymes and hormones underlying the biosynthesis of these specific hydrocarbons. status: publishe...|$|E
