50|$|The {{advantage}} of the <b>inertia</b> <b>starter</b> is that, because the motor is not driving the engine directly, it can be of much lower power than the standard starter for an engine of the same size. This allows for a motor of much lower weight and smaller size, as well as lighter cables and smaller batteries to power the motor. This made the <b>inertia</b> <b>starter</b> a common choice for aircraft with large radial piston engines. The disadvantage is the increased time required to start the engine - spinning up the flywheel to the required speed can take between 10 and 20 seconds. If the engine does not start {{by the time the}} flywheel has lost its inertia then the process must be repeated for the next attempt.|$|E
50|$|An {{aero engine}} <b>inertia</b> <b>starter</b> uses a pre-rotated {{flywheel}} to transfer kinetic {{energy to the}} crankshaft, normally through reduction gears and a clutch to prevent over-torque conditions. Three variations have been used, hand driven, electrically driven and a combination of both. When the flywheel is fully energised either a manual cable is pulled or a solenoid is used to engage the starter.|$|E
50|$|The {{self-powered}} version, the GAU-4 (called M130 in Army service), is gas-operated, tapping gun {{gas from}} {{three of the}} six barrels to operate the gun gas driven mechanism. The self-powered Vulcan weighs about 10 lb more than its electric counterpart, but requires no external power source to operate, except for an electric, <b>inertia</b> <b>starter</b> to initiate gun rotation, allowing the first rounds to be chambered and fired.|$|E
50|$|The {{other systems}} {{used during the}} period were {{electric}} motors (such as those used in automobiles today), <b>inertia</b> <b>starters</b> (cranked either by hand or an electric motor) and compressed-air starters, which operated much like Coffman starters but were powered by pressurized air tanks.|$|R
50|$|Shotgun {{starters}} {{had several}} advantages over other starting systems in {{use at the}} time. Electric starters required large, heavy, and often troublesome batteries to be carried on board, or external charging equipment had to be located at every place where the vehicle was anticipated to operate. <b>Inertia</b> <b>starters</b> used a heavy wheel, usually made of brass, which was spun by a hand crank or electric motor, causing the spinning wheel to engage the starter ring gear. The Coffman system was more lightweight and compact than inertial starters or internal batteries, {{and it did not}} require any special auxiliary equipment, an important feature when operating in remote areas.|$|R
50|$|Diesel {{engines are}} more {{susceptible}} to hydrolock than gasoline engines. Due to their higher compression ratios, diesel engines have a much smaller final combustion chamber volume, requiring much less liquid to hydrolock. Diesel engines also tend to have higher torque, rotating <b>inertia,</b> and stronger <b>starter</b> motors than gasoline engines. The result is that a diesel engine is more likely to suffer catastrophic damage.|$|R
50|$|The {{subsequent}} SUU-23/A {{uses the}} GAU-4/A self-powered Vulcan, {{with an electric}} <b>inertia</b> <b>starter</b> {{to bring it up}} to speed. Both pods ejected empty cases and unfired rounds rather than retaining them. Both pods contained 1,200 rounds of ammunition, with a loaded weight of 1615 and 1720 lb respectively. During service in the Vietnam War, the pods proved to be relatively inaccurate: the pylon mounting was not rigid enough to prevent deflection when firing, and repeated use would misalign the pod on its pylon, making matters worse.|$|E
5000|$|Commercial-Wing (1927) with a 220 hp Wright J-5. Its {{specifications}} were: wing span: 39'4", length: 25'10", range: 550 miles, ceiling: 18,500 ft. The plane cost $10,500 with an <b>inertia</b> <b>starter,</b> {{brakes and}} metal prop. Four planes {{were made with}} the Wright engine (c/n 101 registration NC173, c/n 102 registration NC2506, c/n 104 registration NC5185, c/n 105 registration NC138N), one with a Hisso (c/n 103 - registration NC3801), and one with a 100 hp Curtis OXX-6. This later one could be a Sportsmans or the NC6525 registration aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Construction of {{the fuse}} and tail was steel tube with a clever {{arrangement}} that eliminated awkward framing around {{the windows of}} the passenger compartment. The sponsons served as attach points for both the landing gear and the forward wing struts, and also were storage for tool kit, battery and other miscellany! Wings were wood with aluminum ailerons and leading edge sheeting. The cabin was mohair fabric upholstered in a style that rivaled the finest automobiles. Navigation lights, cabin and instrument lights, metal propeller, and a choice of electric <b>inertia</b> <b>starter</b> or Heywood compressed air starters was all standard equipment.|$|E
50|$|A variant on the {{electric}} starter motor is the <b>inertia</b> <b>starter</b> (not {{to be confused}} with the Bendix-type starter described above). Here the starter motor does not turn the engine directly. Instead, when energized, the motor turns a heavy flywheel built into its casing (not the main flywheel of the engine). Once the flywheel/motor unit has reached a constant speed the current to the motor is turned off and the drive between the motor and flywheel is disengaged by a freewheel mechanism. The spinning flywheel is then connected to the main engine and its inertia turns it over to start it. These stages are commonly automated by solenoid switches, with the machine operator using a two-position control switch, which is held in one position to spin the motor and then moved to the other to cut the current to the motor and engage the flywheel to the engine.|$|E
50|$|The rear of {{the tank}} held an engine {{compartment}} flanked by two separate rear compartments each containing a fuel tank and radiator. The Germans had not developed an adequate diesel engine, so a petrol (gasoline) powerplant had to be used instead. The original engine utilised was a 21.35-litre (1303 cu.in.) 12-cylinder Maybach HL 210 P45 developing 485 kW (650 hp) at 3,000 rpm. Although a good engine, it was underpowered for the vehicle. From the 251st Tiger onwards, it {{was replaced by the}} upgraded HL 230 P45, a 23.095 litre (1409 cu.in.) engine developing 521 kW (700 hp) at 3,000 rpm. The main difference between these engines was that the original Maybach HL 210 used an aluminium engine block while the Maybach HL 230 used a cast-iron engine block. The cast-iron block allowed for larger cylinders (and thus, greater displacement) which increased the power output to 521 kW (700 hp). The engine was in V-form, with two cylinder banks set at 60 degrees. An <b>inertia</b> <b>starter</b> was mounted on its right side, driven via chain gears through a port in the rear wall. The engine could be lifted out through a hatch on the rear hull roof.|$|E
