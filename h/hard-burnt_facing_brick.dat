40|$|By the late-nineteenth {{century the}} brick {{industry}} was largely mechanized. In {{accordance with the}} changing technologies' capacity to produce greater numbers of increasingly uniform products (in shape, color and durability), the notion of—and market for—"face brick" changed drastically during this time. It was because of this newfound uniformity that <b>face</b> <b>brick</b> ultimately became fully differentiated from the lower-quality "common brick" product. Over the next decades, architects and builders became increasingly interested {{in the use of}} textured and multi-colored <b>face</b> <b>brick</b> for the exterior of buildings. This was a strict departure from the earlier years of largely smooth-surfaced brick production. The production of <b>face</b> <b>brick</b> was truly a national industry by the 19 -teens, and it was reported that in 1915 <b>face</b> <b>brick</b> was produced in forty-two states across the United States. The widespread location of good brickmaking clays, rail transportation, and product marketing all contributed {{to the success of the}} <b>face</b> <b>brick</b> industry. Research on this topic revolves around color, texture and size of early twentieth century <b>face</b> <b>brick</b> and explores the ways in which product trends evolved throughout the decades before and after the turn of the new century. Research has also been undertaken on the role and development of technology in production—how raw materials, equipment and methods changed to reflect evolving aesthetic trends. Production methods (soft-mud, stiff-mud, dry-press, re-press) have been investigated, as has the role of <b>face</b> <b>brick</b> manufacturers in the evolution of brick size standardization within the larger building brick industry. The rapid evolution of <b>face</b> <b>brick</b> production processes, terminology, and aesthetics over the course of approximately sixty years (1880 - 1940) created an ever-growing national <b>face</b> <b>brick</b> industry that was cemented by the 1912 establishment of the American <b>Face</b> <b>Brick</b> Association. The development of this association has been traced, revealing its early role in the aesthetic and terminological standardization of products, as well as its publication of a large number of catalogs which no doubt led to the widespread use of <b>face</b> <b>brick</b> on buildings large and small, in a multitude of urban and suburban environments across the country. In the late 1930 s, the American <b>Face</b> <b>Brick</b> Association merged with several other clay products associations to form the Structural Clay Products Institute, the predecessor of today's Brick Industry Association. This research has revealed a strong connection to not only today's preservation professionals, but to clay brick industry members such as manufacturers and distributors. Due to the historical nature of the brick trade and the lack of organized documentation of early twentieth century <b>face</b> <b>brick,</b> however, it is often difficult to visually identify, research, and subsequently reproduce a deteriorated <b>face</b> <b>brick</b> product. Knowledge of historic production methods and products is therefore essential for both preservation consultants and trade-oriented participants of a <b>face</b> <b>brick</b> restoration project, particularly as increasing numbers of <b>face</b> <b>brick</b> preservation projects are likely in the coming years...|$|R
