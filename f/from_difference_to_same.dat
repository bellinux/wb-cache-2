The production of hierarchies in the arenas of governance is discussed, defending {{the hypothesis that the}} shift <b>from</b> <b>difference</b> <b>to</b> inequality is the result of practices of justification that consolidate the sovereignty of technical competence in environmental management. Some of the more significant findings of studies about the structure and functioning of River Basin Committees in different regions of the country are taken as reference for this discussion. Based on these findings, we discuss the discursive production of the Committees, the authority of the agents that embody the new principles of management, and the implications of the process of scientification of the politics. The article concludes by pointing out the importance of diversity in {{the construction of a new}} narrative of environmental governance...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{approach}} to learning and tracking arbitrary image features is presented. Tracking is tackled by learning the mapping <b>from</b> image intensity <b>differences</b> <b>to</b> displacements. Linear regression is used, resulting in low computational cost. An appearance model of the target is built on-the-fly by clustering sub-sampled image templates. The medoidshift algorithm is used to cluster the templates thus identifying various modes or aspects of the target appearance, each mode is associated to the most suitable set of linear predictors allowing piecewise linear regression <b>from</b> image intensity <b>differences</b> <b>to</b> warp updates. Despite no hard-coding or offline learning, excellent results are shown on three publicly available video sequences and comparisons with related approaches made. ...|$|R

The findings indicate that (a) printed colors {{are affected by the}} presence of OBA <b>from</b> no <b>difference</b> <b>to</b> noticeable <b>difference,</b> (b) âˆ†E 00 has a stronger linear correlation with visual color difference than âˆ†E*ab does, (c) there is no significant association between illumination levels and visual color difference. This research introduces the metric, OBA, per ISO 15397 (2013), as the CIE-b* difference in color pairs under M 1 and M 2 conditions. It also defines âˆ†OBA as the OBA difference between any color pairs, including substrates. The results show that there is linear correlation (1) between visual difference and âˆ†E 00 which describes the color difference, and (2) between visual difference and âˆ†OBA which describes the criticalness of M 1 lighting to realize the color match...|$|R
