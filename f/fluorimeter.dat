50|$|The emitted photons from excited {{lanthanides}} are {{detected by}} highly sensitive devices and {{techniques such as}} single-photon detection. If the lifetime of the excited emitting level is long enough, then time-resolved detection (TRD) {{can be used to}} enhance the signal-to-noise ratio. The instrumentation used to perform LRET is relatively simple, although slightly more complex than conventional <b>fluorimeters.</b> The general requirements are a pulsed UV excitation source and time-resolved detection.|$|R
50|$|Filters and/or {{monochromator}}s {{may be used}} in <b>fluorimeters.</b> A monochromator transmits {{light of}} an adjustable wavelength with an adjustable tolerance. The most common type of monochromator utilizes a diffraction grating, that is, collimated light illuminates a grating and exits with a different angle depending on the wavelength. The monochromator can then be adjusted to select which wavelengths to transmit. For allowing anisotropy measurements, the addition of two polarization filters is necessary: One after the excitation monochromator or filter, and one before the emission monochromator or filter.|$|R
50|$|The most {{versatile}} <b>fluorimeters</b> with dual monochromators and a continuous {{excitation light source}} can record both an excitation spectrum and a fluorescence spectrum. When measuring fluorescence spectra, the wavelength of the excitation light is kept constant, preferably at a wavelength of high absorption, and the emission monochromator scans the spectrum. For measuring excitation spectra, the wavelength passing though the emission filter or monochromator is kept constant and the excitation monochromator is scanning. The excitation spectrum generally {{is identical to the}} absorption spectrum as the fluorescence intensity is proportional to the absorption.|$|R

Summary This report looks at aspects of an underway biogeochemical observing {{system for the}} Australian waters: location, frequency, vessels and platforms, instrumentation and ancillary equipment. Evaluating this information, recommendations are made to support two trans-basin (Pacific Ocean) and a single, localised (Tasman Sea/Bass Strait) lines. The latter should be a high-frequency transect to capture shorter term events; a ferry would be an appropriate vessel. Instrumentation suggested to be deployed includes <b>fluorimeters</b> and radiometers, flow analysers for nutrients (and possibly micronutrients) and devices to measure components of the carbon dioxide system. The program of underway measurements must be effectively integrated with other observing system elements (buoys, floats, satellites, etc.). ...|$|R

40|$|Fluorescence {{spectroscopy}} {{is unique}} in its combination of sensitivity with experimental versatility. The advent of relatively affordable, robust, yet sophisticated, benchtop <b>fluorimeters</b> {{in conjunction with the}} vast and growing number of commercially available fluorescent probes have contributed to the accessibility and popularity of fluorescence spectroscopy. It {{has become one of the}} most important analytical techniques for the in vitro study of biomolecules and in vivo cellular imaging, providing spatial and temporal information. This chapter discusses the majority of techniques commonly used in the study of biomolecules. The quintessential fluorescence-based technique is steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy. In contrast to steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy, time-resolved fluorescence analysis can facilitate the simultaneous analysis of multiple emissive states with overlapping spectral bands, each with its own fluorescence decay, by deconvolution of a sample's multiexponential decay curve. Steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy, time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy, and fluorescence anisotropy are typically concerned with monitoring a single fluorescent probe...|$|R
50|$|Cells {{are often}} used in bioreceptors because they are {{sensitive}} to surrounding environment and they can respond {{to all kinds of}} stimulants. Cells tend to attach to the surface so they can be easily immobilized. Compared to organelles they remain active for longer period and the reproducibility makes them reusable. They are commonly used to detect global parameter like stress condition, toxicity and organic derivatives. They {{can also be used to}} monitor the treatment effect of drugs. One application is to use cells to determine herbicides which are main aquatic contaminant. Microalgae are entrapped on a quartz microfiber and the chlorophyll fluorescence modified by herbicides is collected at the tip of an optical fiber bundle and transmitted to a <b>fluorimeter.</b> The algae are continuously cultured to get optimized measurement. Results show that detection limit of certain herbicide can reach sub-ppb concentration level. Some cells can also be used to monitor the microbial corrosion. Pseudomonas sp. is isolated form corroded material surface and immobilized on acetylcellulose membrane. The respiration activity is determined by measuring oxygen consumption. There is linear relationship between the current generated and the concentration of sulfuric acid. The response time is related to the loading of cells and surrounding environments and can be controlled to no more than 5min.|$|E
5000|$|High Resolution Melting {{analysis}} is the simplest PCR-based method to understand. Basically, the same thermodynamic properties that {{allowed for the}} gel techniques to work apply here, and in real-time. A <b>fluorimeter</b> monitors the post-PCR denaturation of the entire dsDNA amplicon. You make primers specific to the site you want to amplify. You [...] "paint" [...] the amplicon with a double-strand specific dye, included in the PCR mix. The ds-specific dye integrates itself into the PCR product. In essence, the entire amplicon becomes a probe. This opens up new possibilities for discovery. Either you position the primers very close {{to either side of}} the SNP in question (small amplicon genotyping, Liew, 2004) or amplify a larger region (100-400bp in length) for scanning purposes. For simple genotyping of an SNP, it is easier to just make the amplicon small to minimize the chances you mistake one SNP for another. The melting temperature (Tm) of the entire amplicon is determined and most homozygotes are sufficiently different (in the better instruments) in Tm to genotype. Heterozygotes are even easier to differentiate because they have heteroduplexes generated (refer to the gel-based explanations) which broadens the melt transition and usually gives two discernible peaks. Amplicon melting using a fluorescently-labeled primer has been described (Gundry et al., 2003) but is less practical than using ds-specific dyes due to the cost of the fluorogenic primer.|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A <b>fluorimeter</b> was constructed which utilises solid state components. The novel arrangement of these components meant that an inexpensive, sensitive, robust and portable <b>fluorimeter</b> was feasible. If the optical components ofthe instrument were selected for a specific assay, a dedicated <b>fluorimeter</b> with comparable sensitivity to a research grade <b>fluorimeter</b> resulted. The construction and evaluation of such a <b>fluorimeter</b> is described. Nile Red is a hydrophobic phenoxazine fluorescent dye, which has an emission in the long wavelength region of the spectrum (600 - 1000 nm). Assays based on fluorescence measurements in this spectral region have the advantage oflower background, reduced scattering and decreased photodecompostion when compared with conventional fluorescence utilising UVNis wavelengths. Nile Red is also a solvatochromic dye, which means it emission wavelength is strongly dependant on its molecular environment. The property is utilised here {{in the development of}} a novel assay for the protein -lactoglobulin. As the fluorescence properties of the Nile Red:Protein complex differ form those ofthe unbound Nile Red molecule, the fluorescence intensity can be related to concentration of the protein present.

40|$|NASBA is an {{isothermal}} {{nucleic acid}} amplification method {{that is particularly}} suited to detection and quantification of genomic, ribosomal or messenger RNA.

40|$|Recent {{discoveries of}} {{different}} modes of exocytosis and {{a plethora of}} molecules involved in neurotransmitter release has resulted in demand for more rapid and efficient methods for monitoring endogenous glutamate release from various tissue sources. In this article, we describe a high throughput microplate version of the enzyme-linked fluorescence detection method for the measurement of released glutamate, which utilises glutamate dehydrogenase, and the reduction of NADP to NADPH. Previous versions of this method rely upon cuvette-based <b>fluorimeters</b> for detection that are limited by large sample volumes and small numbers of samples that can be measured simultaneously. Comparison between the two methods shows that the microplate assay has comparable performance to the cuvette-based assay but {{has the capacity to}} analyse many times more samples in a given run.

40|$|AbstractEnteric {{pathogens}} {{are typically}} inferred from {{the presence of}} surrogate indicator organisms such as thermotolerant (faecal) coliforms (TTCs). The analysis of TTCs requires time-consuming incubation in suitable laboratories, which can limit sampling resolution, particularly during critical pollution events. Here, we demonstrate the use of in-situ <b>fluorimeters</b> targeting tryptophan-like compounds as a rapid, reagentless indicator of TTCs in groundwater-derived potable water supplies in Africa. A range of other common indicators of TTCs were also determined including nitrate, turbidity, and sanitary risk survey scores. Sampling was conducted during both the dry and wet seasons to investigate seasonality. Tryptophan-like fluorescence was the most effective predictor of both presence/absence and number of TTCs during both seasons. Seasonal changes in tryptophan-like fluorescence in deeper supplies suggest it is transported more efficiently through the aquifer than TTCs. Moreover, the perennial elevated concentrations in some wells suggest it is more resilient than TTCs in groundwater. Therefore tryptophan-like fluorescence {{could also be a}} better indicator of some smaller, more easily transported, and long-lived, pathogenic enteric viruses. These sensors have the potential to be included in real-time pollution alert systems for drinking water supplies throughout the world, as well as for mapping enteric pathogen risks in developing regions...|$|R

40|$|We {{developed}} a versatile DNA assay and framework for monitoring polymerization of DNA {{in real time}} and at the single-molecule level. The assay consists of an acceptor labelled DNA primer annealed to a DNA template that is labelled on its single stranded, downstream overhang with a donor fluorophore. Upon extension of the primer using a DNA polymerase, the overhang of the template alters its conformation from a random coil to the canonical structure of double stranded DNA. This conformational change increases {{the distance between the}} donor and the acceptor fluorophore and can be detected as a decrease in the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiency between both fluorophores. Remarkably, the DNA assay does not require any modification of the DNA polymerase and albeit the simple and robust spectroscopic readout facilitates measurements even with conventional <b>fluorimeters</b> or stopped-flow equipment, single-molecule FRET provides additional access to parameters such as the processivity of DNA synthesis and, for one of the three DNA polymerases tested, the detection of binding and dissociation of the DNA polymerase to DNA.
