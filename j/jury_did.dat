5|$|The trial {{ended with}} Lhermitte {{receiving}} the maximum sentence {{for the murder}} of her five children. The court and the <b>jury</b> <b>did</b> not take any extenuating circumstances into account. In her closing argument, Lhermitte said she would accept any punishment the court gave her and showed remorse for her actions. Earlier in the trial, psychiatrists had found that Lhermitte was not of sound mind when she committed the acts and should not be held accountable for her actions. They felt that she should be admitted into a psychiatric institution rather than going to prison, but the <b>jury</b> <b>did</b> not follow their opinions. Lhermitte had been battling with depression for many years. She concluded that she saw the murder of her children and committing suicide as her only way out.|$|E
5|$|Police {{departments}} throughout Oregon {{decline to}} press charges, or {{charges have been}} dropped for possessing and growing marijuana, even for convicted drug dealers. Salem police estimated they received 30 or 40 calls for marijuana activity in 2007 which were not pursued because the grow operations were legal, even one next to a high school. One grower, a previously convicted felon, was found with evidence of making hash oil, which is not protected, though a grand <b>jury</b> <b>did</b> not indict him.|$|E

25|$|Whites {{continued}} {{to resort to}} lynchings to keep dominance, and tensions rose. White mobs committed murders, accompanied by wholesale destruction of black houses, churches and schools, in the small communities of Ocoee, November 1920; Perry in December 1922; and Rosewood in January 1923. The governor appointed a special grand jury and special prosecuting attorney to investigate Rosewood and Levy County, but the <b>jury</b> <b>did</b> not find sufficient evidence to prosecute. Rosewood was never resettled.|$|E
25|$|As {{the details}} of the {{original}} shooting event emerged, police established curfews and deployed riot squads to maintain order. Along with peaceful protests, there was looting and violent unrest {{in the vicinity of the}} original shooting. According to media reports, there was police militarization when dealing with protests in Ferguson. The unrest continued on November 24, 2014, after a grand <b>jury</b> <b>did</b> not indict Officer Wilson. It briefly continued again on the one-year anniversary of Brown's shooting. The U.S. Department of Justice concluded Wilson shot Brown in self-defense.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of decision, the Supreme Court of Georgia had {{reviewed}} 63 rape cases. Only six of these involved a death sentence. The Georgia court had set aside one, leaving five death sentences for rape intact from among all the rape convictions obtained since Furman. From the statistical evidence, the Court concluded that in at least 90% of rape cases, the <b>jury</b> <b>did</b> not impose a death sentence. The objective evidence, state death penalty laws, and behavior of juries, suggested {{that the death penalty}} for rape was rare.|$|E
500|$|The Grand <b>Jury</b> Clause <b>does</b> very little, if anything, to {{regulate}} the procedures of the grand jury. For example, the Clause does not prohibit a grand jury indictment based solely on hearsay evidence. Non-fundamental flaws with the grand jury, such {{as a violation of}} the defendant's self-incrimination rights or a violation of grand <b>jury</b> secrecy <b>do</b> not trigger a right not to be tried. In United States v. Williams (1992), where the Court rejected a rule that would have required [...] "substantial exculpatory evidence" [...] to be presented to the grand <b>jury,</b> the defendant <b>did</b> not even argue a Fifth Amendment violation. The lack of a grand <b>jury</b> <b>does</b> not deprive the court of jurisdiction, and the defendant may waive the grand jury right.|$|R

25|$|Since {{the death}} penalty was imposed, both the {{conviction}} and sentence were automatically appealed to the Georgia Supreme Court. Davis and his lawyers requested a new trial, citing problems with the trial site and selection of the jury. The request was denied in March 1992. In March 1993, the Georgia Supreme Court also upheld Davis's conviction and sentence, ruling that the judge had correctly refused to change trial site and that the racial composition of the <b>jury</b> <b>did</b> not deny his rights. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal in November 1993. Direct appeals having been exhausted, in March 1994 an order was signed for Davis's execution.|$|E

Bundy {{was charged with}} two murders: Murray and the unknown victim whose killing she confessed to having been present at. Clark was charged with six murders. At his trial, he acted as his own defense counsel and tried to blame Bundy for everything, portraying himself as an innocent dupe. The <b>jury</b> <b>did</b> not believe {{him and he was}} sentenced to death in 1983. He remains on California's death row. Bundy, on the other hand, made a plea bargain and in return for her testimony received only a 52 years to life sentence. Bundy died in prison from heart failure on December 9, 2003, at the age of 61.|$|E
25|$|At the Fatal Accident Inquiry held in Banff in February 1972 Adam Watson was {{the chief}} expert witness for the Crown. It emerged that the consent form issued to parents {{did not say that}} winter {{mountaineering}} was involved. Also, only one of the parents had been told the outing was going to be to the Cairngorms. The Inquiry reported that the deaths had been due to cold and exposure. It recommended (1) there should be special regard for fitness and training, (2) parents should be given fuller information about outdoor activities, (3) parties should be led by fully qualified instructors and accompanied by certified teachers, (4) suitable locations for summer and winter expeditions should be identified in consultation with mountaineering organisations, (5) experts should advise on whether high-level shelters should be removed, (6) the mountain rescue teams were praised and consideration should be given to supporting the teams financially and generally, (7) following any future disaster there should be closer liaison between authorities and parents. The <b>jury</b> <b>did</b> not want to discourage future adventurous outdoor activities. The advocate for the parents suggested that the overall leader of the expedition and the principal of Lagganlia should be found at fault but the Inquiry did not make any finding of fault.|$|E

2500|$|In Pennsylvania, {{the purpose}} of the grand jury is to {{recommend}} charges. The grand jury hears cases in full but does not have the authority to indict. [...] In the case of Jerry Sandusky, the grand jury investigation began in 2009 under then Attorney General and eventual Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett. [...] This was Pennsylvania's 30th Statewide Investigating Grand Jury. They subpoenaed records from both Penn State and the Second Mile and heard testimony from Victim 1 (Aaron Fisher), Mike McQueary, Joe Paterno, Tim Curley, Gary Schultz, Victim 7, Graham Spanier, Victim 4, and Ronald Petrosky (PSU Janitor). This grand <b>jury</b> <b>did</b> not recommend indictment.|$|E
2500|$|Sampson {{was charged}} {{in a federal}} court in Boston, found guilty and, on December 23, 2003, sentenced to death. The jury deliberated for ten hours after hearing six weeks of evidence. Sampson had pleaded guilty, so the <b>jury</b> <b>did</b> not need to decide whether he killed McCloskey and Rizzo, but the jury heard the murders {{described}} in graphic detail during the sentencing phase of the trial. Prosecutors portrayed Sampson as a ruthless, calculating killer who preyed on good samaritans. [...] The last time the Commonwealth used the penalty was in 1974. It {{was the first time}} anyone in Massachusetts has been sentenced to die under the federal death penalty law.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{unanimous}} in its result, the Supreme Court split six to three in its legal {{analysis of the}} case. The issue was whether the trial judge made a legal error in his instructions to the jury, and in particular in his [...] "re-instruction" [...] responding to the jury's question about Pickton's liability {{if he was not}} the only person involved. Writing for the majority, Madam Justice Charron found that [...] "the trial judge's response to the question posed by the <b>jury</b> <b>did</b> not adversely impact on the fairness of the trial". She further found that the trial judge's overall instructions with respect to other suspects [...] "compendiously captured the alternative routes to liability that were realistically in issue in this trial. The jury was also correctly instructed that it could convict Mr. Pickton if the Crown proved this level of participation coupled with the requisite intent." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{result is}} the modern {{perception}} that the [...] "not proven" [...] verdict is an acquittal used when the judge or <b>jury</b> <b>does</b> not have enough evidence to convict but is not sufficiently convinced of the accused person's innocence {{to bring in a}} [...] "not guilty" [...] verdict. Essentially, the judge or jury is unconvinced that the suspect is innocent, but has insufficient evidence to the contrary.|$|R

5000|$|Occasionally, {{grand juries}} go aggressively {{beyond the control}} of the prosecuting attorney. When the grand <b>jury</b> <b>does</b> so the {{situation}} is called a [...] "runaway" [...] grand jury.

Such cases were common in the 19th century but have become infrequent since the 1930s.|$|R
2500|$|The killing being indisputable, Carnegie {{would have}} been {{condemned}} if the jury had merely given a verdict {{on the point of}} fact. In these circumstances, his counsel, Robert Dundas of Arniston, told the jury that they were entitled to judge on [...] "the point of law" [...] as well as the [...] "point of fact". He asserted that they should only decide whether in their conscience Carnegie had committed murder, or whether his guilt was not diminished or annihilated by the circumstances of the case. Quite unexpectedly the <b>jury</b> <b>did</b> not give a verdict of either [...] "proven" [...] or [...] "not proven" [...] but instead gave a verdict of [...] "not guilty", thus establishing a great constitutional principle of a Scottish Jury's right to jury nullification and endowing Scots with the verdicts: [...] "proven", [...] "not proven" [...] and [...] "not guilty" [...] which remain contentious to this day.|$|E
2500|$|Hypothetical speculations, {{with which}} the coroner's <b>jury</b> <b>did</b> not agree or disagree, were {{presented}} to the inquiry on the possible condition of the vessel prior to its foundering. The life-jacketed corpses that washed ashore south of Grand Haven were seen {{by some as a}} sign that the doomed vessel had fallen into what is called the [...] "trough" [...] of the gale waves. [...] This is a condition when a boat, often a boat with impaired metacentric functions, cannot recover after being hit broadside by a breaking wave. [...] Partly swamped, the rolling boat falls down in the wave troughs and does not rise with the wave crests. [...] Questions were raised, at the inquiry and later, about the metacentric stability of the Andaste with its topside self-unloading machinery. [...] Great Lakes seamen were aware that a structurally similar (although not identical) aggregate freighter, the SS Clifton, had been refitted with similar topside self-unloading machinery and had disappeared with all hands on Lake Huron in September 1924.

2500|$|In an {{anonymous}} interview, the jury foreman stated, [...] "When I {{had to sign}} off on the verdict, the sheet that was given to me—there was just a feeling of disgust that came over me knowing that my signature and [...] signature were {{going to be on the}} same sheet," [...] but that [...] "there was a suspicion of [...] " [...] that played a part in the jury's deliberations. The foreman stated his work experience enabled him to read people and that George Anthony [...] "had a very selective memory" [...] which stayed with the jurors, emphasizing that the jury was frustrated by the motive, cause of death, and George Anthony. [...] "That a mother would want to do something like that to her child just because she wanted to go out and party," [...] he said. [...] "We felt that the motive that the state provided was, in our eyes, was just kind of weak." [...] Although the foreman objected to Casey Anthony's behavior in the wake of her daughter's death, he and the <b>jury</b> <b>did</b> not factor that behavior into their verdict because it was not illegal. They initially took a vote on the murder count, which was 10–2 (two voting guilty), but after more than ten hours of deliberation, they decided the only charges they felt were proven were the four counts of lying to law enforcement.|$|E
40|$|This article {{proposes a}} theory of “representative deliberation” to {{describe}} the democratic ideal that jurors seek to practice.

However, the <b>jury</b> <b>does</b> hold together elements of all of these theories. In line with direct democracy, we select jurors from the people-at-large. In line with representative democracy, we seek to draw jurors from a representative cross-section of the community. In line with deliberative democracy, jurors talk as well as vote and seek to change one another’s minds. The resulting hybrid is what this article calls “representative deliberation. ” The core idea is that deliberation works best on diverse panels where jurors from different backgrounds bring different views and life experiences to bear on the impartial consideration of the evidence. The article reviews empirical studies supporting the theory of representative deliberation and proposes changes in jury selection to remove obstacles to empaneling representative juries...|$|R
