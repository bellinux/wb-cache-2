5|$|Between April 1918 and May 1919, the Spanish <b>Flu</b> killed {{approximately}} 25 {{million people}} worldwide, {{far more than}} {{had been killed in}} four years of war. A rigorous quarantine policy was implemented in Australia; although this reduced the immediate impact of the <b>flu,</b> the nation's death toll surpassed 11,500.|$|E
5|$|In June 2010, a {{team at the}} Mount Sinai School of Medicine {{reported}} the 2009 <b>flu</b> pandemic vaccine provided some cross-protection against the 1918 <b>flu</b> pandemic strain.|$|E
5|$|Several Pacific island territories were {{particularly}} hard-hit. The pandemic reached them from New Zealand, which was {{too slow to}} implement measures to prevent ships carrying the <b>flu</b> from leaving its ports. From New Zealand, the <b>flu</b> reached Tonga (killing 8% of the population), Nauru (16%) and Fiji (5%, 9,000 people).|$|E
5|$|An {{effort to}} {{recreate}} the 1918 <b>flu</b> strain (a subtype of avian strain H1N1) was a collaboration among the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, the USDA ARS Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory and Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City. The effort resulted in the announcement (on 5 October 2005) that the group had successfully determined the virus's genetic sequence, using historic tissue samples recovered by pathologist Johan Hultin from a female <b>flu</b> victim buried in the Alaskan permafrost and samples preserved from American soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Earlier {{hypotheses}} of the epidemic's origin have varied. Some hypothesized the <b>flu</b> {{originated in}} East Asia. Dr. C. Hannoun, leading expert of the 1918 <b>flu</b> for the Institut Pasteur, asserted the former virus {{was likely to}} have come from China, mutating in the United States near Boston and spreading to Brest, France, Europe's battlefields, Europe, and the world using Allied soldiers and sailors as main spreaders. He considered several other hypotheses of origin, such as Spain, Kansas, and Brest, as being possible, but not likely.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, Brinkley {{opened a}} 16-room clinic in Milford, where he won over the locals {{immediately}} by paying good wages, invigorating {{the local economy}} and making house calls on patients afflicted with the virulent and deadly outbreak of the 1918 <b>flu</b> pandemic. For all his later infamy as a charlatan, accounts of his success at nursing <b>flu</b> victims back to health, and the lengths to which he went to treat them, were resoundingly positive.|$|E
5|$|In August 1918, a more {{virulent strain}} {{appeared}} simultaneously in Brest, France; in Freetown, Sierra Leone; {{and in the}} U.S. in Boston, Massachusetts. The Spanish <b>flu</b> also spread through Ireland, carried there by returning Irish soldiers. The Allies of World War I came {{to call it the}} Spanish <b>flu,</b> primarily because the pandemic received greater press attention after it moved from France to Spain in November 1918. Spain was not involved in the war and had not imposed wartime censorship.|$|E
5|$|In December 2008, {{research}} by Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the University of Wisconsin linked {{the presence of}} three specific genes (termed PA, PB1, and PB2) and a nucleoprotein derived from 1918 <b>flu</b> samples {{to the ability of}} the <b>flu</b> virus to invade the lungs and cause pneumonia. The combination triggered similar symptoms in animal testing.|$|E
5|$|On 18 January 2007, Kobasa et al. (2007) {{reported}} that monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) {{infected with the}} recreated <b>flu</b> strain exhibited classic symptoms of the 1918 pandemic, and died from a cytokine storm—an overreaction of the immune system. This may explain why the 1918 <b>flu</b> had its surprising effect on younger, healthier people, as {{a person with a}} stronger immune system would potentially have a stronger overreaction.|$|E
5|$|Rohmer {{contracted}} Asian <b>flu</b> in 1958 {{and died}} {{the following year}} after related complications. His best-known character outlived him through numerous film, radio and television interpretations.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before he}} joined Port Vale, Horsfield {{fell victim to}} the swine <b>flu</b> pandemic. In January 2013, he {{received}} emergency treatment for blood clots on both lungs.|$|E
5|$|Some {{cases may}} be {{triggered}} by the influenza virus and potentially influenza vaccine. An increased incidence of Guillain–Barré syndrome followed influenza immunization that followed the 1976 swine <b>flu</b> outbreak (H1N1A/NJ/76); 8.8 cases per million recipients developed the complication. Since then, close monitoring of cases attributable to vaccination has demonstrated that influenza itself can induce GBS. Small increases in incidence have been observed in subsequent vaccination campaigns, {{but not to the}} same extent. The 2009 <b>flu</b> pandemic vaccine (against pandemic swine <b>flu</b> virus H1N1/PDM09) did not cause a significant increase in cases. It is considered that the benefits of vaccination in preventing influenza outweigh the small risks of GBS after vaccination. Even those who have previously experienced Guillain–Barré syndrome are considered safe to receive the vaccine in the future. Other vaccines, such as those against poliomyelitis, tetanus or measles, have not been associated with a risk of GBS.|$|E
5|$|The {{second season}} of Survivors was delayed {{because of the}} real-life swine <b>flu</b> {{epidemic}} in 2009 and thus was broadcast in 2010.|$|E
5|$|The site of {{the very}} first {{confirmed}} outbreak was at Camp Funston, Fort Riley, Kansas, then a military training facility preparing American troops for involvement in World War I. The first victim diagnosed with the new strain of <b>flu</b> on Monday, March 11, 1918, was mess cook Private Albert Gitchell. Historian Alfred W. Crosby recorded that the <b>flu</b> originated in Kansas, and popular writer John Barry echoed Crosby in describing Haskell County, Kansas, as the point of origin.|$|E
5|$|The unusually severe disease killed up to 20% {{of those}} infected, {{as opposed to}} the usual <b>flu</b> {{epidemic}} mortality rate of 0.1%.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most {{strains of}} influenza, H1N1 does not disproportionately infect adults older than 60years; {{this was an}} unusual and {{characteristic}} feature of the H1N1 pandemic. Even {{in the case of}} previously very healthy people, a small percentage will develop pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This manifests itself as increased breathing difficulty and typically occurs 3–6 days after initial onset of <b>flu</b> symptoms. The pneumonia caused by <b>flu</b> can be either direct viral pneumonia or a secondary bacterial pneumonia. In fact, a November 2009 New England Journal of Medicine article recommends that <b>flu</b> patients whose chest X-ray indicates pneumonia receive both antivirals and antibiotics.|$|E
5|$|While {{suffering}} {{an unknown}} illness {{in the summer}} of 2009, it was suspected that Boucaud could have contracted swine <b>flu.</b> His first child was born in 2010.|$|E
5|$|A large {{factor in}} the {{worldwide}} occurrence of this <b>flu</b> was increased travel. Modern transportation systems {{made it easier for}} soldiers, sailors, and civilian travelers to spread the disease.|$|E
5|$|An unusual {{feature of}} this {{pandemic}} was that it mostly killed young adults. In 1918–1919, 99% of pandemic influenza deaths in the U.S. occurred in people under 65, and nearly half in young adults 20 to 40years old. In 1920, the mortality rate among people under 65 had decreased sixfold to half the mortality rate of people over 65, but still 92% of deaths occurred in people under 65. This is noteworthy, since influenza is normally most deadly to weak individuals, such as infants (under age two), the very old (over age 70), and the immunocompromised. In 1918, older adults may have had partial protection caused by exposure to the 1889–1890 <b>flu</b> pandemic, known as the Russian <b>flu.</b>|$|E
5|$|Birds {{can act as}} vectors for {{spreading}} {{diseases such}} as psittacosis, salmonellosis, campylobacteriosis, mycobacteriosis (avian tuberculosis), avian influenza (bird <b>flu),</b> giardiasis, and cryptosporidiosis over long distances. Some of these are zoonotic diseases that can also be transmitted to humans.|$|E
5|$|In Game 3 of the 2014 World Series, his post-season on-base streak {{ended at}} 25. In Game 4, while ailing with the <b>flu,</b> his 13th multi-hit post-season game {{brought him to}} second in that {{category}} in franchise history, behind Frankie Frisch.|$|E
5|$|In addition, the {{outbreak}} {{coincided with the}} deaths and media focus on the First World War. Another explanation involves the age group affected by the disease. The majority of fatalities, from both {{the war and the}} epidemic, were among young adults. The deaths caused by the <b>flu</b> may have been overlooked due to the large numbers of deaths of young men in the war or as a result of injuries. When people read the obituaries, they saw the war or postwar deaths and the deaths from the influenza side by side. Particularly in Europe, where the war's toll was extremely high, the <b>flu</b> may not have had a great, separate, psychological impact, or may have seemed a mere extension of the war's tragedies.|$|E
5|$|In season two of British drama Downton Abbey, Lavinia Swire dies of the Spanish <b>flu</b> in April 1919, {{after her}} fiancé Matthew Crawley recovers from {{injuries}} and temporary paralysis from the Great War.|$|E
5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{is excited}} about her {{vacation}} week, until she gets a text message from her assistant, Cerie Xerox (Katrina Bowden), that the hotel she had planned to stay at was overbooked. Liz goes to see Dr. Leo Spaceman (Chris Parnell) who is giving out <b>flu</b> shots at the 30 Rock studios. She learns that the shots are given to select few employees. Her boss, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), asks her {{to let him know}} about the most important individuals in her staff that should receive <b>flu</b> shots. Liz does not agree with Jack that he should ration out health care, which results in Liz not getting a shot. Jack considers giving the show's page, Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer), one of the remaining shots, as he is very ill with the <b>flu,</b> though Kenneth refuses. Later, Jack continuously asks Liz, but still refuses. This time, she displays her solidarity in front of The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS) crew who show her their appreciation. However, as she sees the crew getting sicker, as days go by, she panics and gets the shot.|$|E
5|$|Marquis {{wished to}} be sent to France, but was {{required}} first to take a course in French. In the meantime, he was assigned to a convalescent hospital. Shortly before being sent overseas, Marquis was assigned to Camp Forrest in Lytle, Georgia, an engineering camp, where he found himself treating victims of the beginning of the 1918 <b>flu</b> pandemic. Marquis arrived in England just as the war ended; the <b>flu</b> epidemic, however, had not. He continued to Cannes, where he was assigned the task of determining the capacity of hotels for use as hospitals. In January 1919 he was assigned to the Hotel Metropole as assistant to the attending surgeon. They were soon overwhelmed with influenza cases. Marquis himself came down with <b>flu</b> but continued working. He was reassigned to the Hotel Suisse in Nice, but, still ill, was ordered back to the US. During the long wait for transport home, he took up medical duties in Gironde, finally docking in the US in June.|$|E
5|$|On 16 September 2008, {{the body}} of British {{politician}} and diplomat Sir Mark Sykes was exhumed to study the RNA of the <b>flu</b> virus in efforts to understand the genetic structure of modern H5N1 bird <b>flu.</b> Sykes had been buried in 1919 in a lead coffin which scientists hoped had helped preserve the virus. However, the coffin {{was found to be}} split because of the weight of soil over it, and the cadaver was badly decomposed. Nonetheless, samples of lung and brain tissue were taken through the split, with the coffin remaining in situ in the grave during this process.|$|E
5|$|Since 1972, BGH {{provides}} {{ground-handling services}} for all airports in Bangladesh; {{the company reported}} a profit of BDT4.5billion for the FY 2011–12. The wholly owned subsidiary BFCC {{was set up in}} 1989 to provide in-flight meals. It is one of Biman's profitable operations, supplying food to Saudia, Etihad, Malaysia Airlines, Thai Airways, Emirates, Dragon Air, China Southern Airlines and Regent Airways, along with casual orders from other airlines operating into Bangladesh. The BFCC consumes 90% of the eggs and chickens from the BPC, another profit-making subsidiary of Biman formed in 1976 and put into operation in November 1980 to rear poultry at farms in Dhaka. Bird <b>flu</b> was detected at one of the farms in March 2007, and many of the birds were culled. This was the first incident of bird <b>flu</b> in Bangladesh.|$|E
5|$|To {{maintain}} morale, wartime censors minimized early {{reports of}} illness and mortality in Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States. However, papers were free to report the epidemic's effects in neutral Spain (such as the grave illness of King Alfonso XIII). This reporting dichotomy created a false impression of Spain as especially hard hit, thereby giving rise to the pandemic's nickname, Spanish <b>Flu.</b> In Spain, a different nickname was adopted, the Naples Soldier (Soldado de Nápoles), which came from a musical operetta (zarzuela) titled La canción del olvido (The Song of Forgetting), which premiered in Madrid during the first epidemic wave. Federico Romero, one of the librettists, quipped that the play's most popular musical number, Naples Soldier, was as catchy as the <b>flu.</b>|$|E
5|$|Worst {{affected}} was German Samoa, {{today the}} independent state of Samoa, {{which had been}} occupied by New Zealand in 1914. A crippling 90% {{of the population was}} infected; 30% of adult men, 22% of adult women and 10% of children died. By contrast, the <b>flu</b> was kept away from American Samoa when Governor John Martin Poyer imposed a blockade. In New Zealand itself, 8,573 deaths were attributed to the 1918 pandemic influenza, resulting in a total population fatality rate of 0.74%. In Ireland, the Spanish <b>Flu</b> accounted for 10% of the total deaths in 1918 which can be seen as quite detrimental considering World War 1 was still occurring.|$|E
5|$|An example {{he gives}} of the {{difficulty}} of obtaining missing data from drug companies is that of oseltamivir (Tamiflu), manufactured by Roche to reduce the complications of bird <b>flu.</b> Governments spent billions of pounds stockpiling this, based in large part on a meta-analysis that was funded by the industry. Bad Pharma charts the efforts of independent researchers, particularly Tom Jefferson of the Cochrane Collaboration Respiratory Group, to gain access to information about the drug.|$|E
5|$|Another major human chain, {{which was}} {{expected}} to occur 5 May, was abruptly postponed the previous night by organizers because {{of the impact of}} previous demonstrations. The cancellation was reported throughout Facebook, Twitter, Tamil television and radio stations and word of mouth. Some thought the cancellation was because of the recent swine <b>flu</b> outbreak. The postponed human chain demonstration instead took place on 9 May through Downtown Toronto, reminiscent of the one that occurred on 30 January.|$|E
5|$|As many {{symptoms}} {{of carbon monoxide}} poisoning also occur with many other types of poisonings and infections (such as the <b>flu),</b> the diagnosis is often difficult. A history of potential carbon monoxide exposure, such as being exposed to a residential fire, may suggest poisoning, but the diagnosis is confirmed by measuring the levels of carbon monoxide in the blood. This can be determined by measuring the amount of carboxyhemoglobin compared {{to the amount of}} hemoglobin in the blood.|$|E
5|$|Cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) is {{appointed}} acting {{principal of}} William McKinley High School after having Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) {{infected with the}} <b>flu.</b> Glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) is also infected, and takes time off work to recover. He is cared for by his ex-wife Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig), which leads to them sleeping together.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} summer, the Jubilee Rink burned down, forcing the Canadiens to build Mount Royal Arena as a replacement. The team also lost their star player Malone, {{who had been}} on loan from the dormant Bulldogs as Quebec rejoined the league in 1919–20. Kennedy died in 1921; he had never recovered from the 1919 <b>flu.</b> His widow sold the team to Leo Dandurand, former player Joseph Cattarinich and Louis A. Letourneau.|$|E
5|$|Eldred {{arrived in}} Italy in July 1918 and {{eventually}} at Sub Chaser Base 25, located in Corfu, Greece in September 1918. There {{he served as}} a machinist aboard submarine chaser SC-244, where they patrolled the Strait of Otranto and were engaged in combat. While in Corfu, Eldred and many others got sick with the <b>flu</b> during the 1918 <b>flu</b> pandemic. The conditions at the hospital were so bad that he had to crawl to a stream to get water, which resulted in a permanent scar on his left hip. Eldred began his return to the United States and arrived in Malta on December 25, 1918. By February 1919, he was in Gibraltar. He was given the option of staying in the Navy until they arrived home in six months or being discharged and paying his own way home. He elected the discharge and was separated from the Navy on March 4, 1919. He met some U.S. Army soldiers who were en route to America aboard an Army troop ship. They took him aboard as a stowaway and loaned him an Army uniform. Eldred slept in a life boat {{on the way back to}} America.|$|E
5|$|Elmer {{recounts the}} initial violent {{backlash}} by humanity and how Ben hid {{the three of}} them from groups out to kill chickens. This is followed by retaliation against humans by chickens, chicken-rights groups, and eventually recognition of chickens as humans by the United Nations. During this time, Elmer becomes a syndicated columnist in a newspaper and writes about chicken-related topics, both light-hearted and serious. The peace between humans and chickens is disrupted in the late 1980s by an outbreak of bird <b>flu.</b> Millions of healthy chickens are killed by humans {{to prevent the spread of}} the disease, and Ben hides Elmer and Helen again. When others come for them, Ben intervenes and is accidentally shot protecting Elmer. Once the <b>flu</b> is contained, humanity expresses regret for its rash actions and Elmer writes a scathing editorial about the panic. His journal entries become less frequent after he and Helen have children.|$|E
