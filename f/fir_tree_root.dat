40|$|AbstractThis {{paper is}} {{intended}} to find the variation in vibration response of blades with the crack size of <b>fir</b> <b>tree</b> <b>root</b> free standing blades. Generation of crack in blade root causes the loss of stiffness {{in the vicinity of}} blade root. It results in shifting of natural frequencies and redistribution of dynamic and static stress in the blade root which may cause failure of the blade. A 3 D finite element model of a blade and its fir-tree roots has been analyzed. Results of FEM study are validated by experimental results of cracked blades. Finally the variation in natural frequency and mode shapes for different sizes cracked blades are studied...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPower {{generation}} in thermal stations typically relies on large steam turbines. The {{corrosion resistant steel}} blades used in the last stage of a typical low pressure rotor set are approximately 1 m long and experience high centrifugal loading during service. They operate in a wet steam environment, at approximately 120  °C while rotating at 3000 rpm, and failure modes are typically either stress corrosion cracking or corrosion fatigue. The blades are retained by a <b>fir</b> <b>tree</b> <b>root</b> which is typically shot-peened to generate compressive residual stresses that resist crack initiation. Finite element (FE) modelling has indicated that, {{in the absence of}} shot-peening, stresses above yield are induced at the <b>fir</b> <b>tree</b> <b>root</b> during operation. To date, no systematic information has been obtained on the level of residual stresses induced in the fir tree by shot-peening and their relaxation, nor are there any guidelines as to the magnitude of residual stresses necessary to ensure integrity of the turbine over a life span of at least twenty years. At least one of these blades has failed in recent years causing a catastrophic failure and severe damage to the turbinegenerator set. This paper will report results from a comprehensive program of residual stress measurements at the shot-peened fir tree roots of service blades, and in specimens that simulate the root, using diffraction data from laboratory and synchrotron X-ray radiation (SXRD). Shot-peening coverage between 75 % and 200 % was used and stresses were measured up to 5 mm into the blades/specimens. Measurements were made in the as-peened condition and after applying cyclic stresses representative of overspeed proof testing and service operation. The results will be used to calibrate FE modelling of residual stresses and as input into fatigue life prediction...|$|E
40|$|Power {{generation}} in thermal stations typically relies on large steam turbines. The {{corrosion resistant steel}} blades used in the last stage of a typical low pressure rotor set are approximately 1 m long and experience high centrifugal loading during service. They operate in a wet steam environment, at approximately 60 °C while rotating at 3000 rpm, and failure modes include high and low cycle fatigue, stress corrosion cracking or corrosion fatigue. The blades are retained by a <b>fir</b> <b>tree</b> <b>root</b> which is normally shot-peened to generate compressive residual stresses that resist crack initiation. Finite element (FE) modelling has indicated that, {{in the absence of}} shot-peening, stresses above yield are induced at the <b>fir</b> <b>tree</b> <b>root</b> during operation. In a shot-peened blade these lead to relaxation of the shot peening residual stresses. To date, no systematic information has been obtained on the level of residual stresses induced in the fir tree by shot-peening and their subsequent relaxation during service loading, nor are there any guidelines as to the magnitude of residual stresses necessary to ensure integrity of the turbine over a life span of at least twenty years. At least one of these blades has suffered catastrophic failure in recent years causing severe damage, in excess of € 100 M, to the turbine-generator set on a South African power station [1]. This thesis reports results from a comprehensive program of residual stress measurements at the shot-peened fir tree roots of service blades, and in specimens that simulate the root conditions, using diffraction data from laboratory and synchrotron X-ray radiation (SXRD). Shot-peening coverage between 75 % and 200 % was used and stresses were measured over a depth of 5 mm into the blades/specimens.

There were still many pine and <b>fir</b> <b>tree</b> <b>roots</b> on the bluff, {{so much of the}} early work by these settlers was removal of the roots, which took a great deal of work and time. As time passed, the area was opened up to farming. [...] There were few trails and no roads on the bluff, so transportation was difficult.|$|R
40|$|The {{modelling}} of {{the friction}} interfaces has received much attention {{in recent years}} from the aerospace industry. In order to obtain reliable prediction of the nonlinear dynamic behaviour of the disc and blades in the aerospace engine the friction forces at interfaces, such as in under-platform dampers, blade and <b>fir</b> <b>tree</b> <b>roots</b> or shrouds, must be modelled accurately. Two contact parameters, namely the contact stiffness and the coefficient of friction, are sufficient to model, with good accuracy, the friction contact. The contact parameters are obtained experimentally, and are of interest for the designer only if representative of the operational environment of the engine. To pursue this aim a test rig {{has been designed to}} perform experiments {{in a wide range of}} temperatures, with different combinations of normal and tangential load, frequencies and mating materials, representative of the real operating condition of the engine. Most of the rigs found in literature perform most likely point contact even if the two bodies have plane mating surfaces. The design of a real plane-on-plane contact test rig is not an easy task but despite the difficulty a solution was found in the design shown in this work. The core of the rig is a tilting mechanism enabling one surface to lies down on the other so that the plane-on-plane contact is achieved, at least within the flatness geometrical tolerance of the surfaces. The results of the experiments are the hysteresis loops, namely the tangential contact force against the relative displacement, from which the contact parameters can be calculated. Measurements of displacements are taken very close to the actual contact area and are performed by means of two laser interferometers. Localized heating is achieved by means of an induction heating machine while a thermocouple measures the temperature at points close to the contact area...|$|R

40|$|In service, turbine {{components}} {{are subjected to}} low-cycle fatigue (LCF) during start-up and shut-down operations, especially at the <b>fir</b> <b>tree</b> <b>root</b> blade-disc connection which has a complex geometry and corresponding high stress concentration. Shot peening generates compressive residual stress (CRS) and strain hardening which can improve fatigue life. However, prediction of the fatigue life of shot-peened components under LCF is challenging due to the complex interaction between the shot peening induced effects and service conditions, especially in regions of high stress concentration. The current study aims to develop a validated 3 -D eigenstrain-based modelling tool, which is capable of simulating the stress/strain evolution under LCF in shot-peened notched samples representative of the real turbine blade fir tree geometry. The residual stress and strain hardening profiles caused by shot peening were first evaluated by experiments and then incorporated into the finite element (FE) model separately. In addition, the Smith – Watson – Topper (SWT) method was used to predict the fatigue life of shot peened samples, based on the stress/strain data generated using the developed FE model...|$|E
40|$|A {{test program}} has been {{conducted}} to measure the vibration damping of three designs of steam turbine blades. These blades were tested in their root attachments, sectioned from retired rotors. Blade loading was accomplished in {{a new type of}} blade damping test rig and damping was evaluated in the lowest tangential and axial blade modes. The test environment was room temperature air. The damping rig concept and development is presented in detail as well as results of an intensive test program. The blade designs are designated as Types A, B, and C, where Types A and B were of a <b>fir</b> <b>tree</b> <b>root</b> design and Type C was a ball and shank design. A total of 86 blades were tested and the influence of vibration amplitude, applied axial (simulated centrifugal) load, and vibration mode on damping logarithmic decrement was studied. For the designs studied, the most important findings were: a) Logarithmic decrement was inversely related to blade centrifugal load. High centrifugal loads resulted in low damping ratios. b) Logarithmic decrements varied in an almost linear manner with vibration amplitude for most tests. Constant logarithmic decrement conditions were not observed. c) The damping test rig worked well in this test series. Long LP blades may cause problems without some design changes. d) Results were highly reproducable per each blade group tested. Typical scatter was observed when comparing the results of one blade group to another. e) Changing the initial excitation amplitude did not cause any changes in the vibration decay. There is one characteristic decay trace for each centrifugal load. Test data was reduced by hand, which caused some difficulty as the damping ratio approached 1. 0. An error in the third decimal place could greatly effect the logarithmic decrement value. It is recommended that a micro-processor be used in future tests...|$|E
40|$|The current paper {{presents}} a numerical {{analysis of the}} effects of shot peening on short crack growth in a low pressure (LP) steam turbine material, FV 448. The fatigue behaviour of this material has been experimentally evaluated using a U-notched specimen (representing the <b>fir</b> <b>tree</b> <b>root</b> geometry of the turbine blade) under 3 -point bend tests. Two different shot peening intensities were considered in this study: an industrially applied shot peening process and a less intense shot peening process. In the modelling work, a 2 -D finite element (FE) model with static short cracks has been developed, incorporating both compressive residual stress and strain hardening distribution effects caused by shot peening. Both linear-elastic (LEFM) and elasto-plastic (EPFM) fracture mechanics were used to characterise the crack driving force in the un-peened and shot-peened conditions, taking into account the effects of stress redistribution caused by residual stress relaxation and crack opening. The stress intensity factor used in the LEFM approach was calculated using the weight function method, and the equivalent stress intensity factor used in the EPFM approach was calculated from the J-integral, which was evaluated using the cracked FE model. These results could explain the mechanism of (experimentally observed) retardation of crack growth through the shot-peening-affected layer and also quantified this influence on fatigue life. The relative contributions of compressive residual stresses and strain hardening were assessed by investigating them separately. The sub-surface compressive residual stress distribution produced by shot peening could effectively reduce crack propagation but the strain hardening distribution, in contrast, can accelerate it. However, strain hardening is expected to hinder the crack initiation process by restricting the plastic deformation during cyclic loading. Predictions of the fatigue life of the shot-peened notched specimens were made based on this numerical analysis. Acceptable results were obtained using both the LEFM and EPFM approaches and the difference between them is discussed...|$|E
40|$|In this study, a {{demonstration}} of the ground penetrating radar (GPR) potential in the health monitoring of a matured tree has been given. The main objectives of the research were to provide an effective mapping of the <b>tree</b> <b>roots</b> as well as reliable simulation scenarios representing a variety of possible internal defects in terms of shape and formation. To these purposes, the soil around a 70 -year-old <b>fir</b> <b>tree,</b> with a trunk circumference of 3. 40 m and an average radius of 0. 55 m, was investigated. A ground-coupled multi-frequency GPR system equipped with 600 MHz and 1600 MHz central frequency antennas was used for testing purposes. In addition to the above objective, finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations of the electromagnetic field propagation through the cross-section of a trunk (consistent with the investigated <b>fir</b> <b>tree)</b> were carried out. A variety of defects representing cavities created due to decay were also simulated.

40|$|The {{analytical}} results from two-dimensional (2 D) and three-dimensional (3 D) {{finite element model}} investigations into the cracking of Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) High Pressure Fuel Turbopump (HPFTP) first- and second-stage turbine blades are presented. Specifically, the initiation causes for transverse cracks on the pressure side of the firststage blade <b>fir</b> <b>tree</b> lobes and face/corner cracks on the downstream <b>fir</b> <b>tree</b> face of the second-state blade are evaluated. Because the blade material, MAR-M- 246 Hf (DS), is highly susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement in the - 100 F to 400 F thermal environment, a steady-state condition (full power level = 109 percent) rather than a start-up or shut-down transient {{was considered to be}} the most likely candidate for generating a high-strain state in the <b>fir</b> <b>tree</b> areas. Results of the analyses yielded strain levels on both first- and second-stage blade <b>fir</b> <b>tree</b> regions that are of a magnitude to cause hydrogen assisted low cycle fatigue cracking. Also evident from the analysis is that a positive margin against <b>fir</b> <b>tree</b> cracking exists for the planned design modifications, which include shot peening for both first- and second-stage blade <b>fir</b> <b>tree</b> areas...|$|R
