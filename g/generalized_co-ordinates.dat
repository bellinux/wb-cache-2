For example, see McQuarrie Hildebrand, and von Schwerin. Below is an example of this usage as employed in the design of robotic manipulators: In the above Lagrange-Eulerequations, there are three types of terms. The first involves the second derivative of the <b>generalized</b> <b>co-ordinates.</b> The second is quadratic in [...] where the coefficients may depend on [...] These are further classified into two types.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} considerations concerning {{usefulness of}} integrals of unnormalized quasi-velocities. These quasi-velocities described by Jain and Rodriguez (IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation 11, 571 / 84, 1995) are obtained {{as a result}} of diagonalization of the manipulator mass matrix in velocity space. Equations of motion are expressed in terms of <b>generalized</b> <b>co-ordinates</b> and an unnormalized velocity vector. Both quasi-velocities and their integrals can serve as a tool for improvement of manipulator dynamics. It is shown that sometimes there exist integrals of these quasi-velocities in explicit analytical form for a 2 d. o. f. manipulator. In other cases one can calculate integrals of unnormalized quasi-velocities using numerical methods. The numerically procedure was used for 3 d. o. f. three-dimensional DDArm robot.

40|$|Vehicle {{dynamics}} simulations {{rely heavily}} on a good tire model, as all the input forces to the multibody vehicle model other than minor aerody-namic forces stem from the wheel. Handling scenarios actuate the vehicle by inputting a steering wheel angle, throttle and brake value to the model {{as a function of}} time. A commonly used tire model used for performing handling simulations with a multibody vehicle is the Pacejka, or Magic For-mula, tire model. It is empirical in nature and relates input slip variables to the reaction forces and moments on the tire with trigonometric functions. Empirically derived parameters describe a certain tire reaction force or mo-ment curve over a range of slip values. The reaction forces and moments are calculated assuming pure slip conditions, then modified to describe com-bined slip effects on the output reactions.

40|$|Theory is {{developed}} for the calculation of dipole transition line strengths and frequencies for rotational and ro-vibrational transitions from wavefunctions expressed in the <b>generalized</b> body-fixed <b>co-ordinates</b> proposed by Sutcliffe and Tennyson (1986, Molec.

These first principles calculations use the highly accurate ab initio electronic potential energy and dipole surface of Meyer, Botschwina and Burton, which has previously been shown by the authors to give ro-vibrational transition frequencies, rotational constants and vibrational fundamentals of spectroscopic accuracy. Three line reassignments are proposed on frequency considerations. Several transitions are proposed as candidates for observation {{on the grounds of}} computed relative intensities.

40|$|A {{finite element}} based method is {{presented}} {{for evaluation of}} linearized dynamic equations of flexible mechanisms about a nominal trajectory. The coefficient matrices of the linearized equations of motion are evaluated as explicit analytical expressions involving mixed sets of <b>generalized</b> <b>co-ordinates</b> of the mechanism with rigid links and deformation mode co-ordinates that characterize deformation of flexible link elements. This task is accomplished by employing the general framework of the geometric transfer function formalism. The proposed method is general in nature and {{can be applied to}} spatial mechanisms and manipulators having revolute and prismatic joints. The method also permits investigation of the dynamics of flexible rotors and spinning shafts. Application of the theory is illustrated through a detailed model development of a four-bar mechanism and the analysis of bending vibrations of two single link mechanisms in which the link is considered as a rotating flexible arm or as an unsymmetrical rotating shaft, respectively. The algorithm for the calculation of the matrix coefficients is directly emenable to numerical computation and has been incorporated into the linearization module of the computer program SPACAR...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the dynamics of disordered periodic structures. The free vibration problem is considered. A method akin to the Rayleigh method is presented. This method is particularly suitable for the study of periodic structures as it exploits the nominal periodicity leading to an approximation that greatly reduces the order of the model. The method is used to calculate the natural frequencies and mode shapes for a pass-band by treating the unknown phases between the nominally identical bays as the <b>generalized</b> <b>co-ordinates</b> of the problem. An illustrative example of a cyclically coupled beam model is presented. In spite of a very large reduction in the computational effort, the results obtained are very accurate both for frequencies and mode shapes even when strong mode localization is observed. To test the performance of the proposed approximation further, a situation where two pass-bands are brought close to each other is considered (a coupled beam model having inherent bending–torsion coupling).

40|$|The {{unavoidable}} {{existence of}} small differences between nominally identical sectors of bladed disks, called mistuning, {{can have an}} important impact on the dynamic behaviour of these structures. In particular, this {{has the potential to}} lead to responses qualitatively different from that of an ideal cyclic, tuned structure and, in turn, to significantly shorter life spans. Study of mistuning as a random phenomenon requires statistical analysis {{of a large number of}} mistuning patterns. This computational task is expensive especially when high-fidelity finite element models are used. This research is concerned with the development of reduced order computational modelling techniques for the dynamic analysis of mistuned bladed disks. These techniques combine accuracy and computational efficiency for a reliable statistical assessment of the effects of mistuning on the dynamics of such systems. For free vibration, the nominal assessment of the effects of mistuning on the dynamics of such systems. For free vibration, the nominal periodicity is exploited, leading to an approximation that greatly reduces the order of the original model. The natural frequencies and mode shapes for a passband are found by treating the unknown complex amplitudes between the nominally identical sectors as the <b>generalized</b> <b>co-ordinates</b> of the problem. In spite of a very large reduction in the computational effort, the results obtained are very accurate both for frequencies and mode shapes even when strong mode localization is observed. To test the perfor 4 mance of the proposed approximation further, a situation where two passbands are brought close to each other is also considered. This method is general in its formulation and has the potential of being used for complex geometries. It is also extended to the frequency response problem. The great advantage is that the statistics of ‘blades’ forced responses can be numerically generated at a cost of a single degree-of-freedom per blade/disk sector model. Furthermore, a stochastic reduced basis approach is developed for the approximation of these statistics. This approach allows for a complete stochastic analysis of the effects of mistuning. The system response is represented using a linear combination of complex stochastic basis vectors with undetermined coefficients. The terms of the preconditioned stochastic Krylov subspace are used as basis vectors. Two variants of the stochastic Bubnov-Galerkin scheme are employed for computing the undetermined terms in the reduced basis representation. Explicit expressions for the response quantities are then derived in terms of the system random parameters. This allows for the possibility of efficiently computing the response statistics in the post-processing stage. This novel approach can be applied either on the original model in the physical domain or on a reduced model in the modal domain as a secondary reduction technique. The accuracy of the response statistical moments computed using this approach can be orders of magnitude better than classical perturbation methods. Finally, component mode synthesis or substructuring and probabilistic methods are combined to generate reduced order models. The Craig-Bampton reduction procedure is applied while using stochastic component modes instead of deterministic modes. An additional calculation of sensitivities of fixed interface modes, constraint modes and substructure-matrices is required with respect to the physical random variables. In the case of turbomachinery mistuned bladed disks composed of nearly identical substructures, the sensitivity analysis can be targeted to only one substructure. One great advantage is that the physical variations can be used as input in the reduced order model. This novel approach allows for an efficient computation of the statistical characteristics of responses and a complete stochastic analysis of the effects of mistuning. <br/...|$|E
