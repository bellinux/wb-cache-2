40|$|A {{web server}} {{is a system}} which hosts a web site and {{provides}} services for any requesting clients. The general purpose web servers compose of an operating system, the web pages or the application and {{a huge amount of}} memory and sometimes a special hardware. The central function unit to get access on an embedded system via Web browser is the Web server. Digital acquisition is done by special ADC. The measured data are stored in external memory in which the memory acts as a data base during web server mode. The ARM processor directly supports the Ethernet service and RS 232 communication. Hence the data has been stored and controlled by some other PCs or network via RS 232 & Ethernet. ARM processor has internal I 2 C module. So it has the ability to communicate with any other peripherals. This system has LCD to display the information and measured parameters which makes the debugging and modification of the parameter easy. The Analog to <b>digital</b> <b>interfacing</b> <b>module</b> is independent with the embedded system, which is beneficial to the system maintenance and upgrade. As the embedded Ethernet interface makes the remote data exchange between the applications become very easy. Here we measure the remote signals and can control the remote devices through reliable protocols and communication network. The embedded web server is interfaced to the appliances and the sensors through the controller and it is via the embedded web server that we can control the appliances and monitor the sensors...|$|R

3000|$|The generic {{design is}} {{composed}} of in silico <b>interface</b> <b>modules,</b> interconnection modules, and in vivo <b>interface</b> <b>modules.</b> The in vivo <b>interface</b> <b>modules</b> allow the system {{to interact with the}} data acquisition systems. The in silico <b>interface</b> <b>modules</b> allow the system to interact with the BMM, set the execution configuration parameters, and provide tools for model optimization and data analysis. The interconnection modules manage the information exchange between the in vivo and in silico <b>interface</b> <b>modules.</b> The design has three data flows. First, data collected from the subject via data acquisition hardware flows into the system through the in vivo <b>interface</b> <b>modules.</b> The interconnection modules then process and send this data to the in silico <b>interface</b> <b>modules,</b> where the data is fed as input to the BMM simulator. In the second data flow, simulation results are fed back into the system via the in silico <b>interface</b> and interconnection <b>modules</b> and are used to control a prosthetic device through the in vivo <b>interface</b> <b>modules.</b> The third data flow propagates the user configuration data to other modules in the design. The user configuration may include some important parameters for the interconnection of in vivo experiments and BMMs, such as the data transmission protocol and data processing options. Though the proposed design deals with interfacing to physical prosthetic devices [10], its integration into the framework is considered future work.
