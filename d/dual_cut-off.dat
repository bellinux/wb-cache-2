30|$|On the contrary, Fig.  14 b shows a {{concrete}} condition map {{based on a}} <b>dual</b> <b>cut-off</b> relative permittivity: regions were judged to be damaged when the cut-off relative permittivity was lower than 6.0 or higher than 11.0. The two thresholds of relative permittivity were determined from μ− 1.5 σ and μ +  1.5 σ, where μ and σ are the average {{and standard deviations of}} relative permittivity of the old concrete bridge decks in this study. Overall, the condition map based on the <b>dual</b> <b>cut-off</b> criteria (see Fig.  14 b) appears to be more closely correlated with the visual inspection map than the condition map based on a single cut-off relative permittivity criteria (see Fig.  14 a). The most severely damaged areas of lane 2 of span 3 of JB- 3 N, and the other damaged areas on JB- 3 N, which were hardly detected in Fig.  14 a, were successfully classified as damaged areas in Fig.  14 b. It is noteworthy that the damaged areas estimated by the <b>dual</b> <b>cut-off</b> relative permittivity criteria are larger than those judged by visual inspection (especially on spans 4 and 5 on JB- 3 N). This phenomenon is related to the improved capability of GPR that is able to detect even minor damages, such as micro-cracks filled with air and/or water, which are generally missed by visual inspection. For example, the relative permittivity of the concrete was found to be larger over the concrete girders (at the vertical axes of −  9.0, −  6.6, −  4.2, −  1.8, 3.0, 5.4, and 7.8  m) and near piers (at the horizontal axes of 30 and 90  m). Those regions are subjected to tensile cracking by the negative moment produced by traffic loads. Therefore, it is demonstrated that the relative permittivity data of GPR signals based on the surface reflection method could be a good indicator of the concrete damage, especially on the surface or sub-surface regions. Deteriorated concrete regions with greater porosity and/or surface-breaking cracks (or concrete with high permeability) can be detected as the regions with higher or lower relative permittivity value than that of solid concrete in wet or dry, respectively, condition.|$|E

Aim To evaluate an algorithm with two distinct cut-offs for {{positive and negative}} prediction of significant fibrosis and cirrhosis in chronic hepatitis B patients. Methods Two cohorts of treatment-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis B (125 training and 92 validation) were consecutively and concurrently examined by percutaneous liver biopsy (LB) and TE. Fibrosis was staged by Metavir (significant fibrosis = F ≥ 2; cirrhosis = F 4) in ≥ 2 cm long liver tissue cores. Results A > 13. 1 kPa positive and a ≤ 9. 4 kPa negative cut-off for cirrhosis had a > 90 % sensitivity and specificity, with an accuracy of 94 %. The corresponding cut-offs for F ≥ 2 were > 9. 4 and ≤ 6. 2 kPa, thus classifying 56 % of patients with an overall accuracy of 90 %. In the validation cohort, F 4 and F ≥ 2 were predicted by the above TE cut-offs with an overall accuracy > 90 %. In 165 patients with higher than upper limit of normal transaminase activity (ALT) the <b>dual</b> <b>cut-off</b> algorithm of TE was as accurate as in the 52 patients with normal ALT values in the prediction and exclusion of cirrhosis, only.

30|$|For comparison, a {{concrete}} condition map {{based on the}} depth-corrected attenuation of GPR signals reflected from the upper layer of rebar is shown in Fig.  14 c. In the sound concrete, the attenuation of radar waves is generally proportional to {{the depth of the}} rebar, detailing the two way travel time. For JB- 3 N and 3 S, it was assumed that 50 % of the concrete was sound and the critical value of the depth corrected attenuation was −  3  dB (Rhee et al. 2016). Table  4 summarizes the estimated damaged areas of each of the spans based on the condition maps obtained from the three different GPR analysis methods (i.e., single- and <b>dual</b> <b>cut-off</b> relative permittivity and depth-corrected attenuation criteria). In addition, the damaged areas of each span were calculated according to the ‘Inspection manual for the bridge (Minister of Land Infrastructure and Transport, Korea Infrastructure Safety and Technology Corporation 2012)’. Figure  14 shows some disagreements between the attenuation and relative permittivity analyses. The discrepancy {{stems from the fact that}} the relative permittivity value measured from the GPR signal reflection method is mainly attributed to the properties of the surface of concrete, and, accordingly, it does not directly provide information on the concrete condition of the rebar layer. However, overall damage indices that were based on the <b>dual</b> <b>cut-off</b> relative permittivity showed a fairly good correlation with those evaluated from the depth-corrected attenuation criteria, although the damage indices that were based on the single value-based criteria tended to underestimate the concrete’s condition. This field observation on Korea expressways indicated that the relative permittivity measurements using the GPR surface refection method was effective in evaluating the surface condition of concrete bridge decks as shown in part good agreement with the attenuation method.|$|E

Experimentally, one found the "soft Pomeron" behaviour, σ_tot∼ s^ 0. 093 (2), that onsets at about 9 GeV, that was later argued to be replaced by the unitarized Froissart + reaction-dependent constant behaviour. We argue that the soft Pomeron and the dual behaviour represent the same physics, creation of an effective field theory "soliton"-like structure (=black hole), that then decays, and so they have to be taken seriously.

The microwave loss is most effectively reduced when the Abrikosov vortex lattice spatially matches the underlying washboard pinning landscape. The forward transmission coefficient S_ 21 (f) of the microstrip has a dc-tunable cut-off frequency f_d which notably changes under dc bias reversal, due to the two different slope steepnesses of the pinning landscape. The device's operation principle relies upon a crossover from the weakly dissipative response of vortices at low frequencies when they are driven over the grooves, to the strongly dissipative response at high frequencies when the vortices are oscillating within one groove. The filter's cut-off frequency is the vortex depinning frequency tunable by the dc bias as it diminishes the pinning effect induced by the nanopattern.

30|$|We have {{estimated}} the multidimensional poverty index (MPI) using the <b>dual</b> <b>cut-off</b> method developed by Alkire and Foster (2007, 2011), which is disseminated in the Human Development Report (HDR) 2010 (UNDP 2010). It has used three dimensions, namely, education, {{standard of living}} and health, and assigns an equal weight to each dimension and an equal weight to each indicator within each dimension. A household gets a weighted deprivation score according {{to the number of}} weighted deprivations experienced by that household, and the total weighted deprivation score ranges between 0 and 1. A household is identified as multidimensional poor if the household’s weighted deprivation score is more than 0.33, which is one third of the total weighted deprivation score. The dimensions, indicators, weights and mean values are presented in Table  1. The weighting of variables and dimensions in the AF method is based on normative decision that assigns an equal weight to each dimension and an equal weight to variables within each dimension. The cut-off point of 0.33 is based on distribution. However, while we have used the equal weighting of dimension and indicators, a cut-off point of 0.34 is used because with that score, a household will be poor in more than one dimension.|$|E
40|$|The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) {{has been}} an {{important}} contribution to the debate on national and international poverty measurement. With the creation of the global MPI, OHPI and UNDP have provided a household-level multidimensional poverty measure for over 100 developing countries that can usefully complement the widely used $ 1. 25 a day income poverty indicator. Given its link to the concept of human development, it is an important element of the suite of human development indicators maintained and published by UNDP. Nonetheless, there are many open empirical questions and issues regarding the conceptual underpinning of the MPI that need to be discussed and carefully considered. This essay discusses issues with the <b>dual</b> <b>cut-off</b> method for poverty identification, and how inequality could be incorporated in this poverty measure. Moreover, the choice of headline indicator is debated. We also propose a number of changes regarding the empirical implementation. These include dropping the WHS as one of the data sources, dropping the BMI as a nutrition indicator, and changing the age ranges and cutoffs for the education and mortality indicators. Different approaches to deal with the large share of households where information on an MPI indicator is missing are also discussed. The empirical relevance of these changes are analysed using the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) for Armenia, Ethiopia, and India. We argue that these changes could pose improvements to the current formulation, but one may need to investigate them further and for a larger number of countries. In a final section, we briefly comment on the HDRO revisions to the MPI in the 2014 Human Development Report, which have been partly based on the recommendations made in this paper...|$|E
40|$|The {{issue of}} poverty {{estimation}} in India has been drawing attention since independence. The process for measuring poverty in India was initiated in early sixties, when {{a working group}} from planning commission provided a quantification of minimum food and non-food requirements of individuals for a healthy living. Theoretical developments on poverty measurement have gradually shifted from the traditional unidimensional approach to the multidimensional concept. [1] Pointed out {{that the study of}} poverty should identify and analyze attributes than monetary which directly influence the individual welfare. In the present study, estimation of poverty in rural Haryana has been undertaken on the aspects of drinking water, sanitation and housing facilities. For estimation of the poverty, the secondary data on selected indicators of drinking water, sanitation and housing facilities from 69 th round of National sample survey office (NSSO) survey have been utilized.

40|$|The study {{involved}} a multidimensional analysis {{of poverty in}} the former South African homeland of QwaQwa. It {{was carried out by}} determining various dimensions of poverty in which the residents of the area are deprived. Seven dimensions of deprivation, constructed from 18 indicators, were identified. These dimensions include education (educational achievement and literacy), housing and clothing (floor material, walls material, roof material and condition, rooms and clothing), water and sanitation (sources of water and sanitation type), assets, (TV or radio, cell phone or landline telephone and other assets) air quality (fuel for lighting, cooking and heating), income and health (proximity to health facilities and food security). The dimensions in the study are equally weighted. The analysis was achieved through a number of theoretical and empirical objectives. The theoretical objectives of the study were related to poverty theories, which included the analysis of unidimensional and multidimensional approaches, as well as a review of previous studies in South Africa, with special attention to the former South African homelands, including QwaQwa, from which the study’s data was collected. In general, the former South African homelands have been characterised as having poor infrastructural development and welfare services, coupled with high levels of poverty, which have resulted in very low standards of living compared to most parts of South Africa. The study considers the historical nature and the poverty dynamics of these areas in providing a comprehensive point of departure to understand the multidimensional nature of poverty, based on Alkire and Foster’s family of measures. Empirically, the study has determined various deprivations and their levels, as defined by union (deprived in one or more indicators), intersection (deprived in all dimensions) and the <b>dual</b> <b>cut-off</b> (cut-off between union and intersection criteria) method of identification. It {{is important to note that}} the identification study is mostly built upon Alkire and Foster’s <b>dual</b> <b>cut-off</b> method of identification. The aggregate deprivation by dimension represented by the approximate headcount in each indicator of seven dimensions used in the study indicated that the former homeland A multidimensional analysis of poverty in a former South African homeland is more deprived than the whole of South Africa in almost all dimensions, regularly by a wide margin. By identifying the poor, any poverty index based on the intersection approach would judge the former homeland of QwaQwa as almost poverty free (0. 002 %) while 100 % of all households would live in poverty if identification of the poor is established on the union approach. However, this study considered a k-threshold (k= 33 %) which is very similar to the k threshold chosen by other researchers in similar frameworks. At k= 33 % of all indicators, about 61 % of the households are deprived in 53. 4 % of total dimensions, on average, with the intensity of poverty M 0 being 0. 32. The study has analysed the poverty dimension through a breakdown of their intensity, in order to establish their specific contribution to overall poverty. Given the cut-off k= 33 %, health, most importantly, is the highest contributor to the breadth of poverty (19. 06 %), followed by water and sanitation (18. 46 %), education (15. 80 %), income (15. 10 %), housing and clothing (14. 16 %), air quality (12. 53 %) and assets (4. 89 %). The study established different levels of poverty by comparing income poverty to multidimensional poverty measures. Multidimensional poverty estimates showed higher estimates of poor, with 61 %, compared to 40 % of households which fall below the income poverty line. The analysis showed that the use of the income measure is bound to underestimate the level of poverty in an area. For example, a certain number of the households, identified non-poor by income, were discovered to have even 11 and 12 deprivations out of a total of 18 dimensions, thus showing the limitation of the monetary measure of poverty. Based on the Spearman correlation, the relationship between the level of income of the household, and the number of deprivations associated with it, indicated a lack of overlap between the group of poor acknowledged by the monetary measure and the group of the poor detected by the multidimensional approach. All pairs were not correlated, and even the income deprivation is not correlated with all other aspects of deprivation, while it is claimed to be the measure of poverty that reflects deprivation in other dimensions. This emphasises the arguments this study is built on, that deprivation in one dimension does not satisfactorily justify the deprivation in any other dimension. A multidimensional analysis of poverty in a former South African homeland The study utilised the aggregate measures of poverty suggested by Alkire and Foster in estimating the change in level of deprivation in QwaQwa, thus establishing the depth and level of inequality in the area. The study performed poverty decomposition, using sub-groups within the area, by examining villages and household characteristics. Concerning the depth and inequality among the poor, the study considered the multidimensional poverty gap M 1 and multidimensional squared poverty gap M 2 for the analysis. The study found that with respective cut-offs there are large poverty gaps and high inequality among deprived states of the poor. Based on the subgroup decomposability property of Alkire and Foster’s poverty measures, the analysis of poverty in eight villages within QwaQwa was undertaken according to household size. At k= 33 % cut-off, the highest multidimensional headcount ratio and intensity of poverty was found in Boitekong followed by Kudumane, Mabolela, Qholaqhoe, Mphatlalatsane, Matsikeng, Ntshehele and Bochabela villages. The study established the robustness of cut-off variations which provides village ranking in terms of areas that are worse off than others. It was confirmed that Kudumane and Boitekong are dominated by other villages both in poverty headcount ratio and intensity of poverty. Combining the inequality and robustness, the study has established that the villages with the highest multidimensional intensity of poverty M 0 and multidimensional poverty gap M 1 have the highest estimates of multidimensional squared poverty gap M 2. This implies that, in those villages, the multidimensionally poor households are far from ceasing to be so and their state is accompanied by high inequality. This pattern was also found when the robustness of village rankings to changes in the poverty cut-off k was used. By exploring the multidimensional poverty based on the former homeland of QwaQwa, using the Alkire and Foster family of poverty measures, the study provides a shift in attention from solely income measures to include other intrinsically important dimensions when analysing poverty. By using the survey data, the study identified the share of poverty in terms of dimensions that hold the highest share of poverty. The study has, in general, provided an analysis of, and insights into, the broader perspective of multidimensional poverty as a necessary shift from the traditional unidimensional perspective of poverty, which basically centres on income. A multidimensional analysis of poverty in a former South African homeland Through the breakdown of dimensions and subgroup decomposability of poverty measures used, the study has provided a methodology which not only produces meaningful results, but can also potentially provide useful tools for budget allocation among areas and within a region, by applying, among other things, the use of different dimensions. It should, however, be noted that the dimensions used in the study are not exhaustive and other dimensions could also be incorporated, subsequently leading to alternative deprivation cut-off values for respective analysis. The case of QwaQwa has demonstrated a classical example of the need to clearly specify the setting area developmental goals on the basis of holistic understanding of households challenges and, in this case, poverty status and levels, if meaningful development is to be achieved. Such an in-depth understanding in setting developmental goals has been enriched from the proposed methodology of the study and can be used as a progress-monitoring instrument. This analysis is particularly relevant in connection to South Africa’s bold adoption of the poverty-related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), keeping in mind the spatial legacy of apartheid. The formulation of effective interventions to combat poverty requires a clear grasp of its manifestations in a particular area. The study’s special contribution is hence on poverty analysis methodology, as guided by the multidimensional poverty measure, which goes beyond the identification of geographical deprivation by setting a threshold level in order to define who the multidimensional poor are, the degree of the deprivations and the nature of their challenges. On the basis of evidence established in this study, five areas of policy adaptation have been recommended. They are the adoption of Alkire and Foster’s methodology in identifying the needs of poor household, the priotisation of the needs/dimensions, prioritisation of target area, the household targeting as determined by the household size, the involvement of local leaders and a suggested model for identifying needs, both at the macro and micro level.
