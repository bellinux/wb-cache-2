500|$|Reviews {{were mixed}} in trade publications, with Paul's garb being {{cited as the}} weakest aspect by two {{different}} reviewers. Walton of The Moving Picture News, praised the film as a success, but did not provide any details as to why it was successful. The Moving Picture World provided a detailed review which praised the adaptation of the novel and found the staging and the acting to be clear and strong. The New York Dramatic Mirror review was negative, criticizing the garb, tempest scene, [...] and describing the acting as lacking in feeling. The Nickelodeon, an uncommon source for Thanhouser reviews, was not fooled by Crane's outfit. The reviewer said, [...] "It is usually <b>good</b> <b>advice</b> <b>to</b> tell a man to 'keep his shirt on,' but we decidedly advise the actor who played the part of Paul in this piece to take his shirt off {{the next time he}} essays the role of a child of nature whose costume consists principally of his own skin plus a few trimmings. Baggy underwear, where his skin ought to be, looks like the arch-fiend. ... The production was adequate up to the point of the tempest and shipwreck, which fell down deplorably. Better to have left it out all together. From here onward the photoplay adapters have departed from the original story, and maybe they were wise. Paul in his nude underwear would have spoiled Virginia's funeral." [...] The film is presumed lost.|$|E
2500|$|After serving {{for a year}} as the Vicar, Ghenadie Petrescu became {{recognized}} as the new Bishop of Argeș. According to Familia, he had an outstanding profile: [...] "He spent over 17 years in this office, serving at the Lord's altar, advancing the clergy's prosperity and the people's instruction, rendering <b>good</b> <b>advice</b> <b>to</b> each and all and, like all good Christians and Romanians, sacrificing large sums for the churches and schools in his care. [...] His philanthropic zeal and his generosity for the poor are well-known to the public." [...] Constantin Dobrescu-Argeș, a journalist and activist from the Curtea de Argeș area, also remembered: [...] "The lower clergy and all the Eparchy have seen him stepping into each and every hamlet, into the most secluded human dwellings; they heard him preaching the awakening, the encouragement and the rebirth of national and religious sentiment among the people. Instead of 400 wooden churches, which could barely stand to be called houses of prayer, he erected 400 temples, beautiful as far as taste and comfort go." [...] During his reign, several new monasteries were reestablished within the Argeș Diocese, at Stănișoara, Ostrov, Turnu etc.|$|E

50|$|The film Cloud Atlas is {{an example}} of {{utilizing}} a shoulder angel plot device in feature film, in which the character of Hugo Weaving whispers bad and <b>good</b> <b>advices</b> <b>to</b> the character of Tom Hanks.
