5|$|Beginning {{with the}} work of J. D. Brown and Marc Henneaux in 1986, {{physicists}} <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> quantum gravity in a three-dimensional spacetime is closely related to two-dimensional conformal field theory. In 1995, Henneaux and his coworkers explored this relationship in more detail, suggesting that three-dimensional gravity in anti-de Sitter space is equivalent to the conformal field theory known as Liouville field theory. Another conjecture formulated by Edward Witten states that three-dimensional gravity in anti-de Sitter space is equivalent to a conformal field theory with monster group symmetry. These conjectures provide examples of the AdS/CFT correspondence that do not require the full apparatus of string or M-theory.|$|E
25|$|Scholars {{from the}} history of ideas <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> {{consultants}} play a part {{similar to that of the}} journeymen of the guild systems: they often travel a lot, work at many companies and spread new practices and knowledge between companies and corporations.|$|E
25|$|Several {{scholars}} <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> tablet G {{contains two}} structurally very different texts. Most of Gr is paraphrased as text K, while {{the last line}} {{and a half of}} Gr and the whole of Gv share short phrases with I and T (or at least Ta) but not the rest of the rongorongo corpus (Pozdniakov 1996:290, 299).|$|E

25|$|When {{there is}} a talk about women and Buddhism, I <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> people often regard the topic as {{something}} new and different. They believe that women in Buddhism has become an important topic because we live in modern times and so many women are practicing the Dharma now. However, {{this is not the}} case. The female sangha has been here for centuries. We are not bringing something new into a 2,500-year-old tradition. The roots are there, and we are simply re-energizing them.|$|E
25|$|For {{more than}} 12 years, {{scientists}} <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> some individuals with autism also have idic(15). In fact, idic(15) {{is the most}} frequently identified chromosome problem in individuals with autism. (A chromosome anomaly involves extra or missing chromosomal material, not changes within the genes such as Fragile X syndrome). It is suggested that the co-occurrence of autism and idic(15) is not by chance. There may be a gene or genes in the 15q11-q13 region that is/are related {{to the development of}} autism in some individuals.|$|E
25|$|Western composers <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> {{the rhythm}} {{in a piece}} of qin music can change; once they seem to have got a beat, the beats change. This {{is due to the fact}} that qin players may use some free rhythm in their playing. Whatever beat they use will depend on the emotion or the feeling of the player, and how he interprets the piece. However, some melodies have {{sections}} of fixed rhythm which is played the same way generally. The main theme of Meihua Sannong, for example, uses this. Some sections of certain melodies require the player to play faster with force to express the emotion of the piece. Examples include the middle sections of Guangling San and Xiaoxiang Shuiyun. Other pieces, such as Jiu Kuang has a fixed rhythm throughout the entire piece.|$|E

You know there is very little that escapes the sharp eyes of Blacky the Crow.|$|R
25|$|A {{secured credit}} card {{is a type}} of credit card secured by a deposit account owned by the {{cardholder}}. Typically, the cardholder must deposit between 100% and 200% of the total amount of credit desired. Thus if the cardholder puts down $1,000, they will be given credit in the range of $500–1,000. In some cases, credit card issuers will offer incentives even on their secured card portfolios. In these cases, the deposit required may be significantly less than the required credit limit, and can be as low as 10% of the desired credit limit. This deposit is held in a special savings account. Credit card issuers offer this because they <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> delinquencies were notably reduced when the customer perceives something to lose if the balance is not repaid.|$|E
25|$|Ireland had no regular central {{authority}} {{capable of making}} new law and hence the Brehon laws were entirely {{in the hands of}} the jurists. As such some early scholars felt that the legal system was essentially unchanging and archaic. However, more recently scholars <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> some methods of change were laid out within the Brehon laws. In particular, Cóic Conara Fugill mentions five bases on which a judge must base judgment, and at least three offer some room for change: fásach (legal maxim), cosmailius (legal analogy), and aicned (natural law) (the other two are roscad, a type of legal verse jurists were trained to create to mark a statement made by someone who knows the law and teistimin (scriptural testimony)). However, it has not yet been studied in detail how exactly these three innovative methods were used.|$|E
25|$|Metzinger {{once did}} {{gorgeous}} mosaics of pure pigment, each little square of color not quite touching the next, so that {{an effect of}} vibrant light should result. He painted exquisite compositions of cloud and cliff and sea; he painted women and made them fair, even as the women upon the boulevards fair. But now, translated into the idiom of subjective beauty, into this strange Neo-Classic language, those same women, redrawn, appear in stiff, crude, nervous lines in patches of fierce color. Surely, Metzinger should know what such things mean. Picasso never painted a pretty woman, though we <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> he likes to associate with them. Czobel sees them through the bars of his cage, and roars out tones of mauve and cinnabar. Derain sees them as cones and prisms, and Braque {{as if they had}} been sawn out of blocks of wood by carpenters’ apprentices. But Metzinger is more tender towards the sex. He arranges them as flowers are arranged on tapestry and wall paper; he simplifies them to mere patterns, and he carries them gently past the frontier of Poster Land to the world of the Ugly so tenderly that they are not much damaged—only more faint, more vegetable, more anaemic.|$|E

500|$|The event CGs were {{decided by}} Nakazawa {{based on the}} game's plot and script, and written down in a {{specification}} document given to the art team. Because this was done before the scenario was completely finished, there were some places that he {{when looking at the}} scenario as a whole realized would have benefited more from a CG than some of the passages that did get one, despite how he updated the specification document every so often throughout the development. Because of this, it was decided to add more CGs to several scenes for the game's [...] "Premium Edition" [...] re-release. A challenge in creating the CGs was that the art team did not understand the game's main plot twist, resulting in several finished CGs with mistakes that a person who does not know about the twist would not <b>have</b> <b>noticed,</b> <b>that</b> had to be fixed. For the background art, inspiration was drawn from the films Cube and The Abyss and the video game Resident Evil.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, Howe turned down several {{requests}} that he stand for alderman in Port Arthur. He did agree to seek {{election to the}} school board in 1921, and headed the polls at his first attempt. He served two 2-year terms on the board, spending the final year as its chairman. Early in their marriage, Clarence and Alice Howe had decided to separate their roles, with Alice Howe having full responsibility for their domestic lives. Howe took no interest in his home life; as an often-absent father he had only a small role in the upbringing of his five children. In the same manner he did not involve his wife in his business (or, later public) life. [...] During his ministerial career, he replied {{in response to an}} opposition question hinting at nepotism, [...] "I don't like to discuss my family in public. Members may <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> my wife never appears on political platforms." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> the {{mechanics}} of the game — the actions available to the player, and the responses resulting from said actions — contrast pointedly with many mechanics of popular FPS games, and that the game deliberately used shooter genre clichés in order to illustrate how ludicrous they are in comparison to real warfare. In particular, unlike other games of its kind, some critics believe that Spec Ops: The Line does not intend the combat to be a fun experience for the player, but rather aims to engage the player by critiquing the shooter genre for being removed from reality and providing players with an unrealistic, morally dichotomous, escapist fantasy. The scene depicting the use of white phosphorus {{has been the subject of}} much scrutiny due to imagery that includes the corpse of a mother clutching her child, and was described as [...] "troubling". In response to complaints that the massacre was unnecessary or exploitative, Williams justified the scene by saying that the plot device was intended to evoke players' anger, and that a valid way to end the game is simply for the player to put the controller down and stop playing.|$|E

500|$|Diefenbaker {{suggested}} {{to the jury}} that the silence on the line which had, he contended, swallowed the words [...] "at Cedarside" [...] might {{have been caused by}} a fish dropped on a snow-covered line by a bird and claimed to have evidence of a previous occurrence. He noted in his memoirs that the incident [...] "was not well documented, but it was all we had". He blamed the disaster on Tisdale, stating that lack of the word [...] "at" [...] before [...] "Gosnell" [...] in the order indicated that the Kamloops dispatcher had not been paying attention, and that he should <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that,</b> according to Diefenbaker, the words [...] "at Cedarside" [...] were missing from Atherton's repeat of the order. The trial had taken four days; the lawyers argued for five hours; Diefenbaker's summation took three of them. Justice McFarlane took an hour to charge the jury. McFarlane told the jurors that if they believed that Atherton had passed the order to conductor Mainprize in the same form he had received it, they would be justified in acquitting him. The jury returned after 40minutes of deliberations. Jury foreman Fred Mounkley announced the acquittal of Atherton, as Atherton's mother wept.|$|E
500|$|At {{the moment}} of touchdown, the spoiler lever was in the [...] "ARMED" [...] position. According to the system logic of the A320's flight controls, {{in order for the}} {{spoilers}} to automatically deploy upon touchdown not only must the spoiler lever be in the [...] "ARMED" [...] position, but both thrust levers must be at or close to the [...] "idle" [...] position. The FDR transcript shows that immediately after the warning, the flight computer recorded the left thrust lever being retarded to the rear-most position, activating the thrust reverser on the left engine, while the right thrust lever (controlling the engine with the disabled thrust reverser) remained in the CL position. One theory put forth by CENIPA is that the pilots may not <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> the right engine remained at CL because the Airbus autothrottle system, unlike other aircraft manufacturers, does not automatically move the levers when the autothrust controller changes engine settings. Therefore, the pilots may have thought that the right engine was at idle power without realizing that Airbus autothrust logic dictates that, when {{one or more of the}} thrust levers is pulled to the idle position, the autothrust is automatically disengaged. Thus, when the pilot pulled the left engine thrust lever to idle, it disconnected the autothrust system and the computer did not retard the right engine power to idle. The A320's spoilers did not deploy during the landing run, as the right thrust lever was above the [...] "idle" [...] setting required for automatic spoiler deployment. Since the right engine thrust lever was still in the [...] "climb" [...] detent at that time, the right engine accelerated to climb power while the left engine deployed its thrust reverser. The resulting asymmetric thrust condition resulted in a loss of control and a crash ensued.|$|E
