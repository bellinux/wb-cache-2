5|$|Severe storms impact {{large cities}} {{more often and}} can damage cars, houses and disrupt public {{services}} such as transportation and collection and disposal of urban solid waste. The foothills of the Andes and the Sierras de Cordoba are vulnerable to hail. This is because the Andes force humid air from the Atlantic upwards, intensifying the updrafts within thunderstorms, making hail more likely. Mendoza, a city located in the Andean foothills, experiences frequent hailstorms that can impact the agriculture of the region. Hailstorms have caused serious losses in both urban and rural areas. It is estimated that wine and <b>fruit</b> <b>production</b> experience yearly losses of US$50 million and US$30 million, respectively, due to hail. Most of these hailstorms occur in the summer although they can occur in winter, particularly in the east where warm and humid air from the north frequently collides with cold air from the south, leading to convective thunderstorms that can produce hail.|$|E
5|$|Further {{excavations}} {{around the}} village of Moreton, which has now been totally submerged, found evidence of a thriving community in medieval times and possibly {{the remains of the}} Nunnery of Santa Cruz. During the Middle Ages farming was the most important activity in the area covered by the lake, supported by four flour mills powered by the River Chew. Stratford Mill was demolished and re-erected in the grounds of Blaise Castle Museum, in north-west Bristol. The largest settlement was Moreton, which is listed in the Domesday Book and survived until the flooding of the lake, when the remains of the Moreton Cross were moved to Chew Stoke Parish Church. There is evidence of lime kilns, which were used in the production of mortar for the construction of local churches. Farming, both arable and dairy, continued until the flooding of the lake, with most households also keeping pigs. There were orchards for <b>fruit</b> <b>production,</b> including apples, pears and plums. Moreton was also the site of gunpowder mill in the 18th century.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT In this work, two {{cultural}} production systems were compared [conventional (CO) and organic (OR) ], {{and its effects}} in the guava trees (Psidium guajava) bacterial blight (Erwinia psidii) control. The experimental design was in radomized blocks, in split-split-plot arrangement, where it was measured the bacterial disease and the <b>fruits</b> <b>production</b> on the 2005 / 06, 2006 / 07 and 2007 / 08 harvests. Four pruning seasons effects were evaluated on the harvests (September, December, March and June) in both production systems. Such systems were constituted of: OR – treatment with bioactive compound (BC), liquid BC and dead coverage, and; CO – chemical fertilization, fungicide and herbicide. In 2007 / 08, the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) of all the treatments in the OR system was lower (~ 54 - 107) than the CO one(~ 233 - 298). In the 2007 / 08 harvest the number of fruits for each plant for all the OR treatments was higher (~ 146 - 204) than the CO ones (~ 57 - 103). In all the harvests, considering all the treatments within each system, there was a significantly lower AUDPC (~ 93 - 184) and higher <b>fruits</b> <b>production</b> (~ 158 - 188) in the OR one than the CO one (AUDPC: ~ 208 - 476; fruits ~ 18 - 104).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{some aspects}} concerning {{the influence of}} the environmental factors from 2008 - 2010 on the both sweet cherry tree growth and fructification. The agricultural years 2008 (a rainy one) and 2009 (a droughty one) can be described as years with special climatic characteristics which influenced negatively the biometrical growing and the tree production in this area. The meteorological factors (during 3 years) were analyzed, the <b>fruit’s</b> <b>production</b> (kg/tree) on varieties was calculated, measurements and biometrical determinations for tree and shoots (the trunk’s cross-sectional area and the length of the annual increases) were made and the correlation coefficient (r) between trunk’s cross-sectional area, length of the annual increases and <b>fruit’s</b> <b>production</b> was determined. In terms of 2008 which was an unusual year with an excess of 338, 4 l/m 2 rainfall compared to the multiannual average and of 2009 which was very droughty with a deficiency of 144, 4 l/m 2 compared to the multiannual average, ‘Cociu’ and ‘Ludovic’ were noted as the most resistant to drought...|$|R

25|$|Diversity of {{terrestrial}} wildlife and fishes in igapó is highly influenced by flooding.

Fish populations are highest during maximum fruiting periods and river dolphins and giant otters move in to prey upon them.

25|$|Michigan is {{a leading}} grower of fruit in the U.S., {{including}} blueberries, tart cherries, apples, grapes, and peaches. Plums, pears, and strawberries are also grown.

25|$|Tree species {{adapted to}} {{seasonal}} inundation {{have adapted to}} maximize <b>fruit</b> <b>production</b> during periods of flooding {{in order to take}} advantage of newly available seed dispersal methods. Fish consume nearly all fruit that fall into the water, and species that are unable to digest the seeds eventually excrete and disperse them into the water. Dispersal by other vectors such as birds and monkeys is secondary to that of fishes in igapó. An important factor in seed survival is the presence of seed predators. Fishes that lack the strong jaws found in characins, such as catfish, digest the fleshy material of the fruit while the seeds pass through the gut unharmed. Because many catfishes are bottom-feeders, they are critical dispersers for seeds that sink upon entering the water.|$|E
