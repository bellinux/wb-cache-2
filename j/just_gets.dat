500|$|The {{execution}} of Saddam Hussein, which Anwar had filmed {{from the internet}} from start to finish, was excluded from the documentary. [...] "We had a big debate {{about whether or not}} that should go into the film", O'Connor explained. Water continued, [...] "it {{was one of those things}} where to see it, it <b>just</b> <b>gets</b> you. But we had to ask ourselves, does it help our story? No." [...] Footage that was nearly edited out included a scene where Anwar had to siphon petrol out of the family car for the house's generator. Anwar explained to the camera that he needed to do it because their family was so poor. [...] "That's tough", commented Water, [...] "because that's a dishonour to his family." ...|$|E
500|$|Moore {{described}} the lyrics {{on the album}} as [...] "just whatever {{is going on in}} my head... I try to development from a stream of consciousness to something that makes sense". He said the lyrics primarily spoke of relationships, [...] "our way of trying to keep them, the resulting problems and that kind of thing". Moore cited Roger Waters and Peter Gabriel as influences on his vocal style, [...] "Those guys don’t have the best voices either, but they pull it off then I figured I could do it too," [...] he said. He noted that musically his progressive influences [...] "will always be there" [...] because they influenced all his music, but could not name any other influences as [...] " [...] to so much stuff it <b>just</b> <b>gets</b> lost".|$|E
500|$|She {{read the}} {{foundational}} text [...] by Scientology founder, science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard, {{and came to}} believe [...] "it was a solution for helping other people". In recalling her initial thoughts upon reading the book by Hubbard, Christman commented, [...] "I was really looking for a higher state of consciousness {{and a way of}} helping people. And I read Dianetics and I felt [...] "WOW this is it!" [...] You know, [...] "I can help people go CLEAR." [...] She hitchhiked from Chicago to Los Angeles to study Scientology in 1969. Her first course in Scientology cost US$35.00. Christman was quoted with a positive comment about Scientology, in the 1992 edition of the Church of Scientology International-produced book What is Scientology?.

500|$|During {{the writing}} for the season, Ward and series' head writer Kent Osborne noted that it was {{increasingly}} difficult to produce new episode concepts because the writers had [...] "already used a lot of cool ideas". Osborne called this slump the [...] "season four blues". Ward went on to clarify that, [...] "everything's still coming out super weird and interesting—but it <b>just</b> <b>gets</b> a little harder. You have to dig deeper." [...] To combat these issues, the writer staff tried different story writing methods, such as a technique called exquisite corpse, in which one writer starts a story {{on a sheet of}} paper, and the paper is folded and another writer tries to finish it. Ward, however, noted that [...] "the ideas are usually terrible". They also decided to experiment with different types of storytelling and to introduce more new characters to the show.|$|E
500|$|In October 2012 {{during an}} interview, Milian spoke of her Young Money debut: [...] "Wayne <b>just</b> <b>gets</b> his artists, which is great, I {{have a very}} {{one-on-one}} business relationship with everybody from Mack Maine to Wayne. They're just very {{involved in the project}} as far as bringing the music, playing songs, just giving their input. [...] I really want to pick the perfect single though. It's been a second since I've been out musically, so I do not want to fail and I don't believe in failure, so I just try new things and figure out the pieces. That's one thing that's great about Wayne. He's like, 'Work with different producers, take your time, but at the same time, try new things. Don't be stuck on one thing.'" [...] In July 2013, it was discovered that her contract with The Voice would be ended.|$|E
500|$|Glee costume {{designer}} Lou Eyrich described Rachel's costuming {{in an interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Originally, the inspiration for her look was Tracy Flick from Election—very buttoned-down, preppy, obnoxious, squeaky clean, nerdy. But she's got at least 12 costume changes each episode. That same look all the time <b>just</b> <b>gets</b> boring for the screen and for the actress to wear, so we spread it out a lot. We try to have her buttoned-up or wearing a nerdy sweater over a cute dress, like she doesn't quite get it right. Or she takes that sweater and tucks it into the skirt and pairs it with knee highs and flats. She makes it her way, which is more quirky. The popular girls {{find a way to make}} it look cool, but Rachel makes it look nerdy. But it's not old-school nerdy with thick glasses and pocket protectors. She thinks she's taking a trend and making it cool, but she wears it wrong." ...|$|E

500|$|Murray {{described}} the character as chauvinistic and [...] "chest-puffing", and compared him to Indiana Jones, stating that [...] "he's {{working his way}} up to become the head of the SSR. His goal in life is to just be great at his job. So he has a large chip on his shoulder, which gives him an attitude." [...] Butters stated that [...] "The problem with Thompson is, he’s such an opportunist, and he so wants to succeed above all other things, that he sometimes makes bad choices. I think he’s not a bad guy, he <b>just</b> <b>gets</b> blinded by ambition." [...] On the character's second season arc, Fazekas reiterated that he [...] "puts his ambition and his ego over other things, over sometimes doing the right thing, and he often doesn't care who gets hurt or who is upset about it ... he actually decides {{to do the right thing}} in the end at great cost to himself." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} by {{television}} critics were mostly positive, noting its [...] "hilarious beginning and the nice ending." [...] Dan Iverson of IGN praised the episode, stating that the episode [...] "looks to show that this fifth season {{is going to bring}} the series back to the irreverent basics that made it so appealing." [...] Iverson went on to comment that some of the jokes were [...] "extremely funny" [...] and that [...] "the episode had it all, from the Electric Company bit to making fun of people who drive Hummers and watch movies like Madagascar." [...] In the conclusion of his review, Iverson gave the episode an eight out of ten. Brett Love of TV Squad also gave the episode a positive review, calling the installment much better than the previous two episode's from the season, [...] "Stewie Loves Lois" [...] and [...] "Mother Tucker", but criticized the storyline's similarity to the South Park episode [...] "Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes". Love commented negatively on the portrayal of Peter working at the superstore, however, stating, [...] "it's a fine line when they go retarded with Peter. Sometimes it plays really funny, and sometimes it <b>just</b> <b>gets</b> annoying." ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{the film}} was not without its detractors. Paul Attanasio of The Washington Post said [...] "the film showcases a visual stylist utterly in command of his talents" [...] and that Angelo Badalamenti [...] "contributes an {{extraordinary}} score, slipping seamlessly from slinky jazz to violin figures to the romantic sweep of a classic Hollywood score," [...] but stated that Lynch [...] "isn't interested in communicating, he's interested in parading his personality. The movie doesn't progress or deepen, it <b>just</b> <b>gets</b> weirder, and to no good end." [...] A general criticism from U.S. critics was Blue Velvets often vulgar approach to sexuality and violence. They asserted that this detracted from the film's seriousness {{as a work of}} art, and some condemned the film as pornographic. One of its detractors, Roger Ebert, praised Isabella Rossellini's performance as [...] "convincing and courageous" [...] but criticized how she was depicted in the film, even accusing David Lynch of misogyny: [...] "degraded, slapped around, humiliated and undressed in front of the camera. And when you ask an actress to endure those experiences, you should keep your side of the bargain by putting her in an important film." [...] While Ebert in later years came to consider Lynch a great filmmaker, his negative view of Blue Velvet remained unchanged after he revisited it in the 21st century.|$|E

500|$|Quinn's {{increasingly}} odd {{behavior was}} commented on by several reviewers. Chaney wrote {{that she was}} acting [...] "in an irrational manner that has no connection with reality", and Bell wondered if co-creator Murphy was [...] "trying to make her the most hated character on 'Glee' ever". Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times, though she noted that [...] "Quinn's character <b>just</b> <b>gets</b> weirder and weirder", wrote that Puck gets it right: [...] "Quinn's the craziest, most self-involved character on the show", but [...] "has a resilience that may take her far in life" [...] and needs a [...] "healthy dose of self-esteem". VanDerWerff was initially pleased that the show [...] "acknowledged that all of her actions are driven by a deep, sucking need to be loved" [...] and that [...] "Puck gently {{told her that she}} was better than that, that she could put herself together again", but not that it then [...] "just turned into more pointless Puck/Shelby/Quinn drama. Ugh." [...] Critics such as Kubicek were even more scathing about Shelby and the storyline with Puck that led to the pair having sex during the episode: [...] "The dumbest storyline Glee has ever done gets even dumber." [...] Sullivan called it [...] "the most divisive plot line of the season", and Bell asked, [...] "Instead of these super creepy scenes between Puck and Shelby, can we please get more screen time for Shelby and Rachel?" ...|$|E
500|$|Sean Fitz-Gerald of Vulture {{wrote that}} [...] "the song veers toward Stefani's more mellifluous, sentimental fare," [...] {{calling it a}} [...] "heartrending track". Amanda Dykan of AltWire praised the track, stating: [...] " [...] reaches through, wraps its acrylic-nailed fingers around your {{pulsating}} heart, rips it from your chest, throws it on the floor, and stomps all over it." [...] Jillian Mapes of Pitchfork Media claimed that [...] "Stefani – now 20 years wiser – flips it"; she continued with: [...] "It’s a rare moment on the album where you can pick out Stefani from a sea of other pop singers." [...] Mapes concluded by claiming that [...] "Used to Love You" [...] was her greatest song since [...] "Don't Speak", comparing its effect to Madonna's 1989 single [...] "Like a Prayer". Sean Fitz-Gerald of Vulture warned that when listening to this [...] "heartending track" [...] that [...] "tissues are a must". Consequence of Sound critic Adam Kivel enjoyed the track, calling it a [...] "recognizable moment in heartbreak delivered in a charming falsetto burble". Nate Jackson from OC Weekly appreciated the [...] "somber" [...] of the track, while Marcus Floyd from Renowned for Sound awarded it 4.5 out of 5 stars, claiming that [...] "every lyric and every note are sung with heart and chorus <b>just</b> <b>gets</b> you". Michael Smith from the same website acknowledged [...] "Used to Love You" [...] {{as one of the}} strongest songs on This Is What the Truth Feels Like, calling it [...] "unexpectedly heartfelt".|$|E
500|$|Flashback is a [...] "fusion of the past, present, and future, {{consisting}} of a totally contagious medley of the best hits and entrancing rhythms". The album's repertoire consists of previously released material along with four new melodies. [...] "Cuéntale" [...] (""), the lead single off the album, has Ivy Queen exploring lyrically as she [...] "plays a mistress who tells her lover to pick between her and his wife". She explained [...] "the mistress <b>just</b> <b>gets</b> tired of seeing him {{for a short time}} and listening to him complain about his unloving wife". Musically, it features danceable grooves, synthetic instrumentation and synthesizers while taking influences from Afro Latin and reggae music; it is set in minor key. [...] "Marroneo" [...] is the second of four newly produced tracks by Rafi Mercenario, [...] "the most highly requested producer in reggaetón" [...] at the time. It received comparisons to Daddy Yankee's [...] "Gasolina". [...] "Si Una Vez" [...] ("") was originally written by Pete Astudillo along with A.B. Quintanilla III and performed by American singer Selena in 1994 on her album Amor Prohibido. Ivy Queen's interpolation of the lyrics tell a story of a [...] "woman who looks back at a lover and wonders why she even loved the lout who abused her love". She choose to cover [...] "Si Una Vez" [...] over other songs by Selena including [...] "Como La Flor" [...] ("") and [...] "La Carcacha" [...] because it was the one she could identify with the most, being more inline with what Queen stands for; citing Selena as her primary influence. The [...] "reggaetón-ed up twist" [...] on Selena's classic, features bitter-romantic lyrics, synthetic instrumentation and synthesizers, while taking reggae influences similar to the original. [...] "I feel honored to be able to sing one of Selena's songs," [...] Queen explained. [...] "She was the first artist to make a successful crossover before Jennifer Lopez and all the rest." [...] "Libertad" [...] (""), the last of the four new tracks on the album was composed in minor key tonality. Queen appears infuriated in the lyrics as the songs takes influences from Afro-Latin music.|$|E

2500|$|After Kornheiser's {{first game}} on Monday Night Football, Paul Farhi wrote in The Washington Post that Kornheiser had {{emphasized}} the obvious, played third fiddle, and was reminiscent of Dennis Miller [...] "in a bad way."

Other criticism has come from Toronto Argonauts play-by-play commentator Mike Hogan, who said, [...] "The thing that really bothers me is that Kornheiser doesn't seem to know his place. If you're there for comic relief, that's one thing. But for God's sake, leave the football analysis to guys who actually played the game." [...] Former NFL offensive lineman Mike Schad also criticized Kornheiser, saying that [...] "when people watch a game, they want to learn something. I don't need a guy who's sarcastic or trying to be funny. I love listening to Ron Jaworski on Monday Nights.
