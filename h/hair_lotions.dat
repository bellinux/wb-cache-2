40|$|Introduction: The {{specificity}} of ethyl glucuronide (EtG) in hair as marker of alcohol consumption exceeds by far those of fatty acid ethyl esters. False positive cases are therefore very rare but not excluded as recent publications have shown. Especially, {{the use of}} plant extracts containing high percentages of ethanol can lead to EtG hair concentrations typically found in cases of chronic alcohol consumption. As proposed by Baumgartner et al., a nucleohilic substitution could most likely explain this phenomenon. Fresh and dried plants as well as commercial <b>hair</b> <b>lotions</b> based on plants extracts have been analysed for EtG presence or EtG formation. Methods: Urtica dioica, Plantago lanceolata, Cortex Quercus, Sempervivum, Armoracia rusticana, Juniperus communis, Brassica alba, Thymian vulgaris, Salvia officinalis, Majorana hortensis, Aloe vera, birch gingko and green tea leafs, ginger, lemon grass were extracted in water, water/ethanol (50 / 50) and ethanol (100 %). The extracts as well as diluted <b>hair</b> <b>lotions</b> were measured by immunological test (Microgenics DRI® EtG assay) and by LC-MS/MS on Shimadzu Nexera UHPLC coupled with an AB Sciex 4500 QTrap. Results: EtG could not be detected in water extracts of all tested plants. However, DRI® EtG assay indicated the presence of EtG in 66 % of the tested ethanolic plant extracts. That could only be confirmed by mass spectrometry {{in the cases of}} fresh thyme as well as in dried birch, oak and plantain extracts where EtG concentrations between of 0. 25 and 2, 09 mg/l were measured. In one hair lotion, the EtG concentration was 0, 76 mg/l. Conclusion: Ethanolic plant extracts represents a non-negligible risk for false positive EtG hair tests, especially when applied as lotion without following washing out. The use of hair care products must therefore be evaluated at every hair sampling. In case of doubt, the product should be analysed by mass spectrometric methods since the presence of EtG can't be proven by use of the DRI® EtG assay, only. Our results support Baumgartner's assumption of a nucleophilic substitution in presence of ethanol because EtG was only measured in the ethanolic extracts...|$|E

40|$|In {{a case of}} {{a driving}} ability assessment, hair {{analysis}} for ethyl glucuronide (EtG) was requested by the authorities. The person concerned denied alcohol consumption and did not present any clinical sign of alcoholism. However, EtG was found in concentrations of up to 910 pg/mg in hair from different sampling dates suggesting an excessive drinking behavior. The person declared to use a <b>hair</b> <b>lotion</b> on a regularly base. To evaluate a possible effect of the <b>hair</b> <b>lotion,</b> prospective blood and urine controls as well as hair sampling of scalp and pubic hair were performed. The traditional clinical biomarkers of ethanol consumption, CDT and GGT, were inconspicuous in three blood samples taken. EtG was not detected in all collected urine samples. The <b>hair</b> <b>lotion</b> was transmitted to our laboratory. The ethanol concentration in this lotion was determined with 35 g/L. The EtG immunoassay gave a positive result indicating EtG, which could be confirmed by GC-MS/MS-NCI. In a follow-up experiment the lotion was applied to the hair of a volunteer over a period of six weeks. After this treatment, EtG could be measured in the hair at a concentration of 72 pg/mg suggesting chronic and excessive alcohol consumption. Overnight incubation of EtG free <b>hair</b> in the <b>lotion</b> yielded an EtG concentration of 140 pg/mg. In the present case, the positive EtG hair findings could be interpreted as the result of an EtG containing hair care product. To our knowledge, the existence of such a product has not yet been reported, and it is exceptionally unusual to find EtG in cosmetics. Therefore, external sources for hair contamination should always be taken into account when unusual cosmetic treatment is mentioned. In those cases, it is recommended to analyze the hair product for a possible contamination with EtG. The analysis of body hair can help to reveal problems occurring from cosmetic treatment of head hair. As a consequence, the assessment of drinking behavior should be based on more than one diagnostic parameter...|$|R
40|$|Dermatological {{inflammatory}} {{diseases such}} as atopic dermatitis, psoriasis and seborrhoeic dermatitis often affect the scalp and the eyebrows. Although there are many dosage forms available, these are particularly critical anatomic regions for application of topical formulations {{because of the presence}} of <b>hair.</b> <b>Lotions</b> are therefore the recommended type of drug delivery system for these areas. The presence of hair may limit the application and thus the acceptability of the formulation and its compliance. Because of its low apparent viscosity, lotion application is unpleasant. Gels, given their consistency and adhesiveness, are a suitable alternative to lotions in this situation. The aim of this study was to formulate a stable gel containing mometasone furoate, which is an anti-inflammatory and anti-pruritic corticosteroid, in order to improve topical treatment of scalp dermatitis. In this study, pharmaceutical development, physical-chemical characterization, stability and in vitro permeation studies were performed. In terms of the pH, viscosity, assay and macroscopic and microbiological properties, the gel was stable over the period of study. The in vitro permeation studies allowed the characterization of the mometasone furoate permeation profile for the gel through different membranes. Mometasone furoate presented a slow permeation through the skin. This gel appears safe for topical application...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Potassium bromate (KBrO 3) {{has been}} {{classified}} as possible human carcinogen. Oxidative stress {{plays a major}} role in the carcinogenic action of KBrO 3. So, the aim was to prove the prooxidative effect of KBrO 3 and to evaluate and compare the possible protective effect of melatonin and ascorbic acid against lipid peroxidation in the thy-roids. Study was done on six groups of rats: (control group) treated with 0. 9 % NaCl: ethanol (v/v 10 : 1), or KBrO 3 in group II, or melatonin in group III, or ascorbic acid in group IV. Rats in groups V and VI were received either melatonin, or ascorbic acid combined with KBrO 3. The results prove lipid peroxidation in the rat thyroid, followed KBrO 3 injection. Treatment with melatonin or ascorbic acid did not affect the basal lipid peroxidation. However, the pre-treatments with either antioxidant ameliorate the lipoperoxidative changes and increase the expression of antioxidant enzymes in rat thyroid. In Conclusion, it is possible that these antioxidants may be of great value as protective agents against KBrO 3 -induced tumor induction in the thyroid. Melatonin is more powerful antioxidant than ascorbic acid. Potassium bromate (KBrO 3) was used as a food additive in flour and barley processing and as a component in cold-wave <b>hair</b> <b>lotions</b> (8). Bromate is frequently detected in tap and bottled water, since it is an inorganic oxyhalide by-product...|$|E

50|$|In {{pharmaceuticals}} and cosmetics, humectants {{can be used}} in topical dosage {{forms to}} increase the solubility of a chemical compound's active ingredients, increasing the active ingredients' ability to penetrate skin, or its activity time. This hydrating property can also be needed to counteract a dehydrating active ingredient (e.g., soaps, corticoids, and some alcohols), which is why humectants are common ingredients {{in a wide range of}} cosmetic and personal care products that make moisturization claims (e.g., <b>hair</b> conditioners, body <b>lotions,</b> face or body cleansers, lip balms, and eye creams).|$|R
30|$|Chitin-based {{nanomaterials}} {{are used}} as carriers for cosmetic ingredients. Morganti et al. (2008) embedded chitin nanoparticles with antioxidants (lutein, melatonin, ectoine) which enhanced the penetration of active ingredients. Combining chitin with antioxidant ingredients also helps to guard the skin from harmful effect of solar radiation due to the scavenging activity of chitin, thereby retarding the photo-aging effects and wrinkles. The chitin polymers are often employed in creams, makeup, <b>lotions,</b> <b>hair</b> care products such as shampoo, hair spray, hair colors and toothpaste, mouthwashes, etc. (Dutta et al. 2004; Gautier et al. 2008). Morganti et al. (2012) combined chitin nanofibrils with hyaluronic nanoparticles to improve the antioxidant activity of chitin. In vivo study was conducted for 60  days on 60 women suffering from photoaging after evaluating the safety concerns on keratinocytes and fibroblasts culture viability.|$|R

40|$|Acid Yellow 23, an anionic azo dye, {{also known}} as Tartrazine,FD&C Yellow 5, CI 19140 or E 102 (in Europe) is widely used in {{medicine}} or cosmetics, foodstuff and textile industries. In pharmaceuticals, Acid Yellow 23 is incorporated as additive in medicines, antacids, vitamin supplements, whereas in cosmetic industries, it is utilized in <b>hair</b> dyes, soaps, <b>lotions,</b> shampoos, bath gels, skin-care creams, deodorants, lipsticks and many others. Due to its very wide use for different purposes, Acid Yellow 23 may be commonly found in municipal wastewaters or wastewaters riginating from textile, food, drugs and cosmetic industry. In this context, it may also result in negative impact on he environment through discharge of improperly treated wstewaters in receiving waters. In this work, the capacity of a Romanian soil to retain Acid Yellow 23 from aqueoussolution by sorption has been investigated. The Freundlich,Langmuir and linear isotherm models were applied to describethe process and the parameters of these equations were calculated.

40|$|Phthalates are {{multifunctional}} {{chemicals used}} {{in a variety of}} applications, including personal care products. The present study explored the relationship between patterns of personal care product use and urinary levels of several phthalate metabolites. Subjects include 406 men who participated in an ongoing semen quality study at the Massachusetts General Hospital Andrology Laboratory between January 2000 and February 2003. A nurse-administered questionnaire was used to determine use of personal care products, including cologne, aftershave, <b>lotions,</b> <b>hair</b> products, and deodorants. Phthalate monoester concentrations were measured in a single spot urine sample by isotope dilution–high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Men who used cologne or aftershave within 48 hr before urine collection had higher median levels of monoethyl phthalate (MEP) (265 and 266 ng/mL, respectively) {{than those who did not}} use cologne or aftershave (108 and 133 ng/mL, respectively). For each additional type of product used, MEP increased 33 % (95 % confidence interval, 14 – 53 %).

40|$|The {{consensus}} on alcohol markers in hair was revised {{for the fourth}} time by an expert group of the Society of Hair Testing based on current state of research. This revision was adopted by the members of the Society during the business meeting in Brisbane on August 29 th 2016. For both markers, ethyl glucuronide (EtG) and fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs), two cut-off values for discrimination between teetotalers or occasional low amount consumption and moderate alcohol drinking (low cut-off), and between non-excessive (abstinence up to moderate alcohol intake) and chronic excessive drinking (high cut-off value) were critically examined. For the current revision, the cut-off values for EtG (7 pg/mg and 30 pg/mg, respectively) remained unchanged despite different findings or discussions published in the meantime. This was mainly {{due to the lack of}} broader data collections from new studies with great numbers of volunteers following thorough study concepts. In contrast, an essential change of the consensus was accepted for the FAEEs, where the concentration of ethyl palmitate (E 16 : 0) can be used autonomously for interpretation instead of the concentration sum (ΣFAEE) of the four esters ethyl myristate, ethyl palmitate, ethyl oleate and ethyl stearate, as previously applied. After evaluation of the data from seven laboratories, the E 16 : 0 cut-off for abstinence assessment was defined at 0. 12 ng/mg for the 0 - 3 cm segment and at 0. 15 ng/mg for the 0 - 6 cm segment. The cut-off for chronic excessive drinking was fixed at 0. 35 ng/mg for the 0 - 3 cm segment and at 0. 45 ng/mg for the 0 - 6 cm segment. The use of E 16 : 0 with these cut-offs in place of ΣFAEE for alcohol intake assessment produces only a minor loss in discrimination power, leads to no essential difference in the interpretation concerning chronic excessive alcohol consumption and is suitable to confirm EtG results in abstinence assessment if ethanol containing <b>hair</b> sprays or <b>lotions</b> are excluded...|$|R
