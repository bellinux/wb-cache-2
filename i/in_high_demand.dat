5|$|The Amber Road was a European trade route {{associated}} with the trade and transport of amber. Amber satisfied the criteria for long distance trade as it was light in weight and was <b>in</b> <b>high</b> <b>demand</b> for ornamental purposes around the Mediterranean.

In July 2005, 9,592 people applied for unemployment services and the payroll of metropolitan firms declined by 13.6% between July 2005 and July 2007, indicating an estimated loss of 70,000 jobs.

5|$|Balabushka used Titlist blanks until 1966 {{when he was}} {{contacted}} by Chicagoan Burton Spain. Spain had recently begun making handmade spliced blanks and was supplying them to Balabushka's closest rival, Frank Paradise. Spain had become fascinated by splicing technology when he came upon a Titlist cue split down the middle in 1965 {{and set out to}} perfect and even improve on the Titlist splice. Spain's original intent was to be predominantly a cuemaker in his own right using his proprietary spliced blanks. However, by 1966 Spain's superior blanks were <b>in</b> <b>high</b> <b>demand</b> and he instead turned to making blanks for other cuemakers full-time, which he continued until 1970.|$|E

Alexandria became an increasingly important center on the trade route with the orient, as exotic luxuries were <b>in</b> <b>high</b> <b>demand</b> in Rome.|$|E
