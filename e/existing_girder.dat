5000|$|In June 2011, the Louisiana DOTD began a $5.7 million repair project (State Proj. No.: H.006783) on the bridge. Safety and {{structural}} repairs included replacing 48 girder pins, {{and the work}} was finished by December 22, 2012. Hangers were used for worker safety and precautions were taken to comply with environmental regulations. The <b>existing</b> <b>girder</b> pins were 4-in. (10.2 cm) and were replaced using 4.5-in. (11.4 cm) pins. To facilitate the larger pins, special custom-built drills were used. New 0.875-in. (2.2 cm) A325 structural bolts {{were used in the}} pin plate connections. Patrick Bernier, project manager for Topcor Services, LLC, general contractor for the project stated, [...] "The bridge is safe, but it is too narrow according to modern highway standards [...] [...] [...] [...] And it is too steep on its approaches.‚Äù.|$|E

It was noted in the report that <b>existing</b> <b>girders</b> required immediate cleaning and painting.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} methods to strengthen existing non-composite steel bridge girders {{by the development}} of composite action between the steel girder and concrete slab. More specifically, the objective {{of this study was to}} identify structurally efficient and practical ways to post-install shear connectors in existing bridges. Various types of post-installed shear connection methods were tested under static, high-cycle fatigue, and low-cycle fatigue loads using a direct-shear test setup. Based on the results of single-shear connector tests, full-scale beam tests were performed under static load to evaluate system performance of the beams retrofitted for partial composite action with post-installed shear connectors. The results of this study clearly demonstrate that the strength and stiffness of existing non-composite steel bridge girders can be increased significantly by post-installing shear connectors. Development of composite action between the <b>existing</b> steel <b>girder</b> and concrete slab through the installation of post-installed shear connectors appears to be a structurally efficient and cost-effective approach to retrofit existing bridges. The addition of postinstalled shear connectors can increase the load capacity of <b>existing</b> steel <b>girders</b> on the order of 40 to 50 %. Preliminary guidelines are provided. 17.

40|$|While {{different}} {{design codes}} provide similar guidance for the flexural design of prestressed thin: webbed continuous girders, the shear design provisions differ greatly. This paper investigates these discrepancies {{with the help}} of eleven experiments and a number of analytical studies. Together these provide the basis for recommendations for engineers conducting the shear design for new girders or evaluating the shear capacity of <b>existing</b> <b>girders.</b> It is shown that the traditional ACI approach of taking Vc as the smaller of Vci, flexural:shear cracking load, and Vcw, web:shear cracking load, can significantly overestimate the shear strength of such girders particularly if they are highly prestressed and contain relatively small quantities of shear reinforcement. The other codes evaluated provided more conservative predictions. It is shown that the ACI predictions can be improved significantly by taking into account the effect of flexural stresses on web shear cracking. While the ACI code uses different shear strength equations for members subjected to external axial loads versus members subjected to internal prestressing forces, the studies summarized in this paper support the idea that unification of these ACI shear provisions is possible.

40|$|Two {{experimental}} {{prestressed concrete}} bridge girder projects {{focus on the}} use of advanced materials including Aramid fiber reinforced polymers (AFRP) bars and self-consolidating concrete (SCC). One specimen is a precast, prestressed concrete bridge girder (TxDOT Type A) reinforced with AFRP that was tested to determine how the girder acts compositely with the bridge deck. The second specimen is a full-scale bridge girder (modified Tx 70) constructed using spliced girder technology with SCC precast, prestressed concrete girder segments. The major objectives of this research are: (1) to characterize the concrete and reinforcement materials for the AFRP girder, (2) to characterize the concrete materials for the spliced girder, and (3) to conduct a comparative analysis of the AFRP girder and the spliced girder concrete materials. AASHTO LRFD (2006), ACI 363 (1992) (revised by Al-Omaishi et al. 2009), ACI 318 (2008), CEB-FIP (2010), and Trejo et al (2008) prediction models were used to conduct a comparative analysis of the behavior of the material properties, such as modulus of elasticity, splitting tensile strength, and modulus of rupture, for both projects. It {{is important to note that}} the trends and models discussed in this thesis are limited to the behavior of the concrete tested for this research and the measured experimental data obtained. Further research into the behavior of SCC, curing conditions, and alternative test methods for mechanical properties of SCC would be beneficial for the future concrete industry. Information concerning the longevity of AFRP use in bridge girder as well as retrofitting <b>existing</b> <b>girders</b> using these construction materials is currently limited. Longer term tests of AFRP and SCC in bridge girders needs to be conducted to discern the behavior of the material after a number of years in service...|$|R

40|$|Carbon Fibre {{reinforced}} Polymers (CFRP) {{have become}} an effective solution to upgrade and strengthen <b>existing</b> box <b>girder</b> bridges in flexure, shear and torsion.

An effective method to increase CFRP material utilization is by appropriately anchoring the ends of the CFRP. In this paper, a study into CFRP end anchorage solutions is presented which formed the basis of the experimental program. Both uni-directional and bi-directional fabric was applied to the ends of CFRP laminates and tested under direct shear loading. Uni-directional fabric was oriented both horizontally across and parallel to the direction of the laminate.

40|$|Abstract: Invisible {{damages in}} bridges, such as {{corrosion}} of rebar, {{may not be}} detected by periodic visual inspection that is the principal method in bridge maintenance. A possible non-destructive technique which has been investigated to assist visual inspection is vibration-based structural health monitoring. The modal properties of bridges, such as the natural frequencies, mode shapes and modal damping ratios, are expected to change due to damages and/or deteriorations. In the present study, damping properties of <b>existing</b> PC <b>girder</b> bridges were identified so as to investigate {{the possibility of the}} modal damping ratios as an indicator of damage detection. Vibration measurements were made at ten single-span PC bridges with similar dimensions under normal service conditions by using wireless and wired sensor systems. Eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA) with an improved screening process was applied to extracted free vibration records. Modal properties up to the fourth vibration modes were identified for many bridges. For the third vibration mode that was identified stably in most bridges, there was a trend that the modal damping ratio of old bridges was greater than other newer bridges. Although this result does not necessarily indicate the relationship between the damage and damping property, it may support the possibility of damping in the evaluation of structural state...|$|R
40|$|Due {{to limited}} resources, {{structural}} health monitoring (SHM) of highway bridges {{has to be}} integrated in structural performance assessment in a cost-effective manner. The instrumentation and the long-term SHM procedures are generally chosen with emphasis on most critical bridge components for a particular failure mode. However, global structural analysis is necessary to obtain useful structural performance information. It is then a major challenge to use monitoring data at some locations to perform a structural reliability analysis at other locations. In this paper, a methodology for lifetime serviceability analysis of <b>existing</b> steel <b>girder</b> bridges including crawl tests and long-term monitoring information is presented. The case where the initial goal of monitoring is to provide data for a fatigue analysis of some bridge components is considered. The monitoring results are used to perform a structural reliability analysis of different sections that are critical considering serviceability of the bridge. Limit state equations are used firstly by adhering to the load and strength formulas and requirements set forth in AASHTO specifications, and secondly by integrating monitoring information. Serviceability with respect to permanent deformation under overload is estimated for the girders with these two different methods and a time-dependent performance analysis is conducted by considering corrosion penetration. The proposed approach {{is applied to the}} I- 39 Northbound Bridge over the Wisconsin River in Wisconsin.

40|$|Structural {{deficiencies}} in Railway steel bridges {{are usually the}} result of deterioration caused by ageing, corrosion, fatigue, and higher load demands. In this context, steel bridge girders are the structural members prone to corrosion which implies a substantially reduction of their flexural capacities. As a result, {{a large number of}} steel railway bridges are in need for strengthening or retrofit. In this thesis, experimental and analytical investigations are conducted to predict the reduction in the flexural capacity of <b>existing</b> deteriorated steel <b>girders</b> under static loading and several retrofitting schemes are developed in the light of strengthening the girder cross-section. The experimental study covers the use of two Carbon Fibre-Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) composite types, namely, normal modulus sheets (NM-CFRP) and high modulus strips (HM-CFRP). A total of thirteen medium-scale W-shape steel beams with a span of 1. 6 m were tested under four-point bending setup. The thirteen beams were divided in four groups such as: i) Group G 1 consisted of four beams with different percentages of cross-sectional area reduction without any strengthening; ii) Group G 2 consisted of four notched beams strengthened with bonded NM-CFRP sheets. Herein, two out of the four strengthened beams, were bonded using saturant epoxy, while the other two were strengthened using high performance adhesive; iii) Group G 3 consisted of two notched beams strengthened with bonded HM-CFRP strip with and without a wrapping system; iv) Group G 4 consisted of three notched beams strengthened with unbonding NM-CFRP sheets and a ductile anchoring system. The results of the experimental study underline the effectiveness of the proposed retrofitting schemes in terms of flexural capacity increase and deflection control of the <b>existing</b> corroded steel <b>girders.</b> In addition to the experimental program, an analytical model was developed to set up a numerical method that is capable of predicting the elastic and post-yield behaviour of the unstrengthened and strengthened deteriorated steel girders. This numerical method can be used by designers to calculate the losses in the moment capacity of the deteriorated steel girders to an acceptable level of accuracy. The analytical model was validated using the experimental results that were presented in the experimental program...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this report is to analyze and calibrate the reliability indices for shear in reinforced concrete bridge <b>girders.</b> <b>Existing</b> statistical models are based on limited experimental data from only a few research tests.

40|$|Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymers (GFRP) plates have {{recently}} received attention {{as a viable}} option for reinforcing existing steel members. Possible application involve web strengthening of <b>existing</b> plate <b>girders</b> and reinforcing corroded flanges and/or webs where a steel plate under combination of shear and/or normal stresses can be governed by their buckling strength. Using GFRP as a retrofit material is attractive from several respects such as easy application, achieving high additional strength with low additional weight, and corrosion resistance. Since the elastic properties of the GFRP, adhesive, and steel are orders of magnitudes apart, reliable predictions of the buckling strength of such systems necessitates careful 3 D modelling involving significant modelling and computational effort. Within this context, the present study develops a simplified buckling theory for steel plates symmetrically reinforced with GFRP plates and subjected to in-plane biaxial normal stresses and shear. The theory idealizes the steel and GFRP as Kirchoff plates while accounting for the transverse shear deformations within the adhesive layers. A variational formulation is first developed {{based on the principle}} of stationary potential energy. The validity of the variational formulation is then assessed through systematic comparisons with results based 3 D finite element models for a variety of buckling problems. The variational principle thus validated, is then used to develop a finite element formulation. The new element features four nodes with five degrees of freedom per node. Results based on the finite element are compared to results based on 3 D modelling to assess its validity. The element is then used to investigate the effect of GFRP thickness, adhesive thickness, and adhesive shear modulus on the critical pressure of composite systems for practical retrofitting problems. It is shown that GFRP thickness is particularly effective in increasing the capacity of the composite system, while the effect of the adhesive layer shear modulus low to moderate. Conversely, an increase in the adhesive thickness is found to correspond to a decrease in buckling capacity of the composite system...|$|R
