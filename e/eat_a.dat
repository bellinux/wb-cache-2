5000|$|The subjunctive mood, {{sometimes}} called conjunctive mood, has several uses in dependent clauses. Examples include discussing hypothetical or unlikely events, expressing opinions or emotions, or making polite requests (the exact scope is language-specific). A subjunctive mood exists in English, but {{it often is}} not obligatory. Example: [...] "I suggested that Paul <b>eat</b> <b>an</b> apple", Paul is not in fact <b>eating</b> <b>an</b> apple. Contrast this with the sentence [...] "Paul <b>eats</b> <b>an</b> apple", where the verb [...] "to eat" [...] is in the present tense, indicative mood. Another way, especially in British English, of expressing this might be [...] "I suggested that Paul should <b>eat</b> <b>an</b> apple", derived from [...] "Paul should <b>eat</b> <b>an</b> apple." ...|$|R

5|$|Belarusian cuisine {{consists}} {{mainly of}} vegetables, meat (particularly pork), and bread. Foods are usually either slowly cooked or stewed. Typically, Belarusians <b>eat</b> <b>a</b> light breakfast and two hearty meals, with dinner being the largest {{meal of the}} day. Wheat and rye breads are consumed in Belarus, but rye is more plentiful because conditions are too harsh for growing wheat. To show hospitality, a host traditionally presents an offering of bread and salt when greeting a guest or visitor.|$|E

50|$|Very informally, causal {{decision}} theory advises decision makers {{to make the}} decision with the best expected causal consequences. The basic idea is simple enough: if <b>eating</b> <b>an</b> apple will cause you to be happy and <b>eating</b> <b>an</b> orange will cause you to be sad then you would be rational to eat the apple. One complication is the notion of expected causal consequences. Imagine that <b>eating</b> <b>a</b> good apple will cause you to be happy and <b>eating</b> <b>a</b> bad apple will cause you to be sad but you aren't sure if the apple is good or bad. In this case you don't know the causal effects of eating the apple. Instead, then, you work from the expected causal effects, where these will depend on three things: (1) how likely you think the apple is to be good and how likely you think it is to be bad; (2) how happy <b>eating</b> <b>a</b> good apple makes you; and (3) how sad <b>eating</b> <b>a</b> bad apple makes you. In informal terms, causal {{decision theory}} advises the agent {{to make the decision}} with the best expected causal effects.|$|R

Tarrare would draw a crowd by eating corks, stones and live animals, and by swallowing an entire basketful of apples one after the other.

5|$|As {{he began}} the third orbit, Schirra {{disconnected}} the spacecraft's gyroscopes, turned off part of the electrical power system, and let the capsule drift. He took advantage of this quiet period to test his spatial awareness and motor control, which he found was broadly unaffected by weightlessness, and to <b>eat</b> <b>a</b> light meal. He powered the spacecraft back up over the Indian Ocean, and continued over the Pacific. At Hawaii, he was given clearance for a full six-orbit mission, and as he crossed over towards California shut down the electrical power for a second period of drifting flight, during which he occupied himself taking photographs with the onboard camera.|$|E
5|$|As omnivores, Campbell's dwarf hamsters <b>eat</b> <b>a</b> {{variety of}} {{different}} foods. A balanced diet for a hamster consists of 16-24% protein, 60-65% carbohydrates, and 5–7% fat, with constant access to fresh water. In their natural habitats, dwarf hamsters feed almost exclusively on plant materials. In captivity, Campbell's dwarf hamsters can get the required nutrition from commercially available food designed specifically for hamsters, which typically contain a mix of dry grains, nuts, and seeds that may be fortified with vitamins and minerals. An excess of any one particular seed or nut can lead to digestive problems, obesity, and forms nutritional deficiency.|$|E
5|$|Balzac's {{work habits}} are legendary, he wrote from 1 am to 8 am {{every night and}} {{sometimes}} even longer. Balzac could write very rapidly; some of his novels, written with a quill, were composed at a pace equal to thirty words per minute on a modern typewriter. His preferred method was to <b>eat</b> <b>a</b> light meal at five or six in the afternoon, then sleep until midnight. He then rose and wrote for many hours, fueled by innumerable cups of black coffee. He would often work for fifteen hours or more at a stretch; {{he claimed to have}} once worked for 48 hours with only three hours of rest in the middle.|$|E
