5|$|The Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI) is a {{recently}} developed measure of gender inequality calculated by analyzing social institutions, societal practices, and legal norms {{and how these}} factors largely frame gender norms within a society.

Through its analysis of the institutional sources of gender <b>inequality</b> <b>in</b> over 100 countries, SIGI has been proven to add new insights into outcomes for women, even when other factors such as religion and {{region of the world}} are controlled for.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Previous {{studies have}} {{reported}} large socioeconomic <b>inequalities</b> <b>in</b> mortality from conditions amenable to medical intervention, but {{it is unclear whether}} these can be attributed to <b>inequalities</b> <b>in</b> access or quality of health care, or to confounding influences such as <b>inequalities</b> <b>in</b> background risk of diseases. We therefore studied whether <b>inequalities</b> <b>in</b> mortality from conditions amenable to medical intervention vary between countries in patterns which differ from those observed for other (non-amenable) causes of death. More specifically, we hypothesized that, as compared to non-amenable causes, <b>inequalities</b> <b>in</b> mortality from amenable causes are more strongly associated with <b>inequalities</b> <b>in</b> health care use and less strongly with <b>inequalities</b> <b>in</b> common risk factors for disease such as smoking. Methods Cause-specific mortality data for people aged 30 – 74 years were obtained for 14 countries, and were analysed by calculating age-standardized mortality rates and relative risks comparing a lower with a higher educational group. Survey data on health care use and behavioural risk factors for people aged 30 – 74 years were obtained for 12 countries, and were analysed by calculating age-and sex-adjusted odds ratios comparing a low with a higher educational group. Patterns of association were explored by calculating correlation coefficients. Results In most countries and for most amenable causes of death substantial <b>inequalities</b> <b>in</b> mortality were observed, but <b>inequalities</b> <b>in</b> mortality from amenable causes did not vary between countries in patterns that are different from those seen for <b>inequalities</b> <b>in</b> non-amenable mortality. As compared to non-amenable causes, <b>inequalities</b> <b>in</b> mortality from amenable causes are not more strongly associated with <b>inequalities</b> <b>in</b> health care use. <b>Inequalities</b> <b>in</b> mortality from amenable causes are also not less strongly associated with common risk factors such as smoking. Conclusions We did not find evidence that <b>inequalities</b> <b>in</b> mortality from amenable conditions are related to <b>inequalities</b> <b>in</b> access or quality of health care. Further research is needed to find the causes of socio-economic <b>inequalities</b> <b>in</b> mortality from amenable conditions, and caution should be exercised <b>in</b> interpreting these <b>inequalities</b> as indicating health care deficiencies. </p...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Information on {{socioeconomic}} <b>inequalities</b> <b>in</b> {{incidence of}} and recovery from disability is still scarce, as is information on socioeconomic <b>inequalities</b> <b>in</b> performance-based disability {{as compared to}} self-reported disability. This study aimed to estimate educational <b>inequalities</b> <b>in</b> the prevalence, incidence, and recovery of self-reported and performance-based disability in two European populations. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We analyzed data from two longitudinal studies on aging. At each wave, {{participants were asked to}} what degree they experienced difficulty with several functional tasks, and interviewers rated their performance on several tasks. Educational <b>inequalities</b> <b>in</b> both outcomes were expressed in terms of prevalence, incidence, and recovery ratios. RESULTS: Educational <b>inequalities</b> <b>in</b> both prevalence and incidence of disability were observed. No large educational <b>inequalities</b> <b>in</b> recovery from disability could be demonstrated. Compared to <b>inequalities</b> <b>in</b> self-reports of disability, <b>inequalities</b> <b>in</b> performance-based disability were equally large in the Dutch study, but smaller in the Italian study. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Inequalities</b> <b>in</b> performance-based measures of disability stress the importance of the association of socioeconomic position with disability among older populations.

40|$|BACKGROUND Smoking {{contributes}} to socioeconomic <b>inequalities</b> <b>in</b> mortality, but {{the extent to}} which this contribution has changed over time and driven widening or narrowing <b>inequalities</b> <b>in</b> total mortality remains unknown. We studied socioeconomic <b>inequalities</b> <b>in</b> smoking-attributable mortality and their contribution to <b>inequalities</b> <b>in</b> total mortality in 1990 - 1994 and 2000 - 2004 in 14 European countries. METHODS We collected, harmonised and standardised population-wide data on all-cause and lung-cancer mortality by age, gender, educational and occupational level in 14 European populations in 1990 - 1994 and 2000 - 2004. Smoking-attributable mortality was indirectly estimated using the Preston-Glei-Wilmoth method. RESULTS In 2000 - 2004, smoking-attributable mortality was higher in lower socioeconomic groups in all countries among men, and in all countries except Spain, Italy and Slovenia, among women, and the contribution of smoking to socioeconomic <b>inequalities</b> <b>in</b> mortality varied between 19 % and 55 % among men, and between - 1 % and 56 % among women. Since 1990 - 1994, absolute <b>inequalities</b> <b>in</b> smoking-attributable mortality and the contribution of smoking to <b>inequalities</b> <b>in</b> total mortality have decreased in most countries among men, but increased among women. CONCLUSIONS In many European countries, smoking has become less important as a determinant of socioeconomic <b>inequalities</b> <b>in</b> mortality among men, but not among women. <b>Inequalities</b> <b>in</b> smoking remain {{one of the most important}} entry points for reducing <b>inequalities</b> <b>in</b> mortality...|$|R

Returning to Havana, Castro took a leading role in student protests against the killing of a high school pupil by government bodyguards.

40|$|Background: While {{educational}} <b>inequalities</b> <b>in</b> mortality {{are substantial}} in most European countries, {{they are relatively}} small in Spain. A {{better understanding of the}} causes of these smaller <b>inequalities</b> <b>in</b> Spain may help to develop policies to reduce <b>inequalities</b> <b>in</b> mortality elsewhere. The aim {{of the present study was}} therefore to identify the specific causes of death and determinants contributing to these smaller inequalities. Methods: Data on mortality by education were obtained from longitudinal mortality studies in three Spanish populations (Barcelona, Madrid, the Basque Country), and six other Western European populations. Data on determinants by education were obtained from health interview surveys. Results: The Spanish populations have considerably smaller absolute <b>inequalities</b> <b>in</b> mortality than other Western European populations. This is due mainly to smaller <b>inequalities</b> <b>in</b> mortality from cardiovascular disease (men) and cancer (women). <b>Inequalities</b> <b>in</b> mortality from most other causes are not smaller in Spain than elsewhere. Spain also has smaller <b>inequalities</b> <b>in</b> smoking and sedentary lifestyle and this is due to more smoking and physical inactivity in higher educated groups. Conclusion: Overall, the situation with regard to health inequalities does not appear to be more favourable in Spain than in other Western European populations. Smaller <b>inequalities</b> <b>in</b> mortality from cardiovascular disease and cancer in Spain are likely to be related to its later socio-economic modernization. Although these smaller <b>inequalities</b> <b>in</b> mortality seem to be a historical coincidence rather than the outcome of deliberate policies, the Spanish example does suggest that large <b>inequalities</b> <b>in</b> total mortality are not inevitable...|$|R
