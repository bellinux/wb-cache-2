40|$|The {{short answer}} {{is to take a}} nap and dream about something. Our dreams are full of originality. Their {{elements}} are all old things, our memories of the past, but the combinations are original. Combinations make up in variety what they lack in quality, as when we dream about Socrates driving a bus in Brooklyn and talking to Joan of Arc about baseball. Our dreams get time, place, and people all mixed up. Awake, we have a stream of consciousness, also containing a lot of mistakes. But we can quickly correct those mistakes, usually before speaking out loud. We can improve the sentence, even as we are speaking it. Indeed, most of the sentences we speak are ones we've never spoken before. We construct them on the spot. But how do we do it, when we say something we've never said before - and it doesn't come out as garbled as our dreams? We also forecast the future in a way that no other animal can do. Since it hasn't happened yet, we have to imagine what might happen. We often preempt the future by taking actions to head off what will otherwise happen. We can think before acting, guessing how objects or people might react to a proposed course of action. That is extraordinary when compared to all other animals. It even takes time to develop in children. By the time a child goes to school, adults start expecting them to be responsible for predicting the consequences: "You should have realized that [...] . " and "Think before you do something like that!" aren't seriously said to babies and most preschoolers - or our pets. We don't seriously expect our dogs and cats to appraise a novel situation, like a fish falling out of the refrigerator, with an eye toward saving it for the <b>dinner</b> guests <b>tonight...</b>|$|R

In their bloody house, Sandy (de Fougerolles) and Ben (Farrugia) congratulate {{themselves}} on their defeat of Youri, the communist killer who murdered their entire family, and who is now lying on the floor, apparently dead. Sandy goes to have a bath while Ben cleans the house {{in preparation for a}} <b>dinner</b> they have <b>tonight.</b> When Sandy comes out of the bathroom, she is attacked by a very alive Youri. Ben tries to protect her and accidentally kills her. He rushes {{out of the house and}} struggles to find the keys to open his convertible car. When he finally succeeds, the killer is only a few feet away from him. Ben, however, remembers with horror that he has forgotten to turn the vacuum cleaner off, and runs back to the house, knocking Youri into a conveniently placed petroleum puddle with the car door. After turning the vacuum cleaner off, he runs back to the car, where a phone call warns him that Youri is standing behind him. Ben fights Youri with his car phone, and manages to send him back into the puddle before setting it on fire. After Ben drives into the sunset, Youri triumphantly emerges from the puddle and the end credits roll.|$|R

I went with the American Minister and took dinner this evening with the King's Grand Chamberlain, who is related to the royal family, and although darker than a mulatto, he has an excellent English education and in manners is an accomplished gentleman. The dinner was as ceremonious as any I ever attended in California--five regular courses, and five kinds of wine and one of brandy. He is to call for me in the morning with his carriage, and we will visit the King at the palace--both are good Masons--the King is a Royal Arch Mason.

40|$|The {{lighting}} {{industry is}} driven to provide light sources and lighting systems that, when properly applied, {{will produce a}} suitable luminous environment in which to perform a specified task. Tasks may include everything from office work, manufacturing and inspection to viewing priceless art objects, selecting the right chair for your living room, and deciding which produce item to select for <b>tonight's</b> <b>dinner.</b> While energy efficiency is a major consideration in any new lighting system design, the sacrifice of lighting quality may cost {{more in terms of}} lost productivity and user dissatisfaction than can ever be saved on that monthly energy bill. During the past several years, many new light sources have been developed and introduced. These product introductions have not been limited to anyone lamp type, but instead may be found in filament, fluorescent and high intensity discharge lamp families. Manufacturers of light sources have two basic goals for new product development. These goals are high efficiency lighting and improved color rendering properties. High efficiency lighting may take the form of either increasing lamp efficiency (lumens of light delivered per watt of power consumed) or decreasing lamp size, thus making a more easily controlled light source that places light where it is needed. The manufacturer's second goal is to produce lamps that render colors accurately while maintaining high efficiency. This paper will discuss new introductions in light sources and lighting systems and how they may impact the design of luminous environments of the future...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the brand}} new and {{exciting}} edition of Walt Disney World Inside Out, Scott Herriott is your [...] "Host, hydrolysis expert," [...] and tour guide through Walt Disney World. First Scott heads to Disney MGM Studios to see Jim Henson's Muppet Vision 3D where he interviews guests {{about what they are}} expecting from this show. After Scott bumps into Sweetums, Scott receives his 3-D glasses and is told by Kermit the Frog that there is no videotaping inside the theater. Scott leaves Kermit saying [...] "that guy looks a lot like Kermit the Frog" [...] not knowing that he is the real deal. After Scott settles in, he watches the movie and kind of interacts with the Muppets. And as always the film ends with the Swedish Chef firing a cannon into the movie screen. After the film, Scott says that he can't tell the viewers about it [...] "but it involves the Swedish Chef, a bunch of penguins and a really big cannon" [...] Kermit the Frog comes up to Scott and tells him that the glasses need {{to come back to the}} theater. Scott then realizes that it really is Kermit the Frog and asks him about the pie scene and Kermit offers to demonstrate. Kermit then tosses the pie into Scott's face and Scott says that [...] "it seems so real". Kermit tells Scott that it's much how they did it [...] Scott asks Kermit about having <b>dinner</b> <b>tonight</b> and that [...] "dessert's on me". Scott then plays tennis at Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa with a kid (the same kid from the intro of this episode) and indicates that the kid's mom produces the show. Then Scott talks about the Legend of the Lion King stage show at the Magic Kingdom. Scott then travels to Bay Lake and talk about [...] "the warm sun, the cool breeze, the water gently lapping at your...lap" [...] and the Hobie 16s before a lifeguard asks Scott if he would try the Hobie 16 out in the water by himself. Scott declines and thanks the lifeguard for asking that question. Scott heads to Disney's Caribbean Beach Resort to host the Walt Disney World Inside Out Hydro-man Water Race. After going over the layout of the course, Scott interviews the two families that are competing: The Yohe family from Syracuse, New York and The Nichols family from Boberbuck, Missouri. The race begins and the Nichols family took a small lead across the water to beach B then held on to that lead going into the paddle boat leg. But the Yohe family were catching up and pulled on ahead and they then pedaled backwards back to beach A. The Yohes take the tag and held on a huge lead going into the colored flags where under two of them the players must find a Mickey Mouse figure. But the Nichols had caught up and they were the first to find the mickey figure. The players then carry their colored flags to two traffic cones with the Nichols being the first to do so and heading towards the water slide. The Yohes were in hot pursuit but it was the Nichols family who came in first. For being the winners, the Nichols family earned these Gaudi gold medals, Goofy shirts and gift certificates. Also since everyone's a winner at Walt Disney World, the Yohe family as well earned the Goofy shirts and the gift certificates. Then Scott checks out the then-new Disney's All-Star Sports Resort. Scott heads on over to Epcot '94 to go inside Innoventions and play video games. Scott goes to Typhoon Lagoon and interviews some guests. Scott heads to the Magic Kingdom to see Fantasy In The Sky and fireworks production support manager Bernie Durgin talks about the history of fireworks at Disney World and at Disneyland. Then Scott plays golf and suggest that he and the viewers take a look at the calendar to see what is coming up in the months ahead at Disney World. The excitement of the summer of '94 continues with three then-brand new attractions. At Disney Studios experience the faster than gravity falls of the terrifying then-new Twilight Zone Tower of Terror. In the Magic Kingdom, Legend of The Lion King opens. And at Epcot '94 Innoventions (Epcot) opens for business. After signing off, Scott hits his golf ball and heads back to Disney-MGM-Studios to search for the ball. Kermit arrives and Scott shows him his club as a clue. Then the ball landed directly behind them and Kermit tells Scott that he was slicing the ball a bit to the left. After Scott and Kermit did some golfing jokes, the episode ends.|$|E

40|$|Normative {{language}} is characteristically used in ethical discussions {{about what we}} must do, what we should do, and what we may do. It {{is also used to}} discuss rather mundane issues where we need to coordinate our activities, e. g. what to do for <b>dinner</b> <b>tonight,</b> and to describe rules and requirements, e. g. what the law requires of us. This dissertation isolates a distinctively linguistic debate about the nature of normative meanings: Do they function to convey information or do they function to direct action? Several groups of linguistic data are marshaled in support of a positive answer to both of these questions. In particular, in chapter one, similarities between the deontic modals 'must', 'may', and 'should' and imperative sentences like 'Do it!' are described in detail. Chapter two explains the linguistic data from chapter one by constructing a theory on which normative meanings include imperatival meanings. The distinctive feature of normative meanings is what they are used to do (to require, to advise, to permit) as well as what they are used to talk about (obligations, values). Chapter three extends the theory so that it explains how the meanings of complex sentences are determined compositionally by the meaning and arrangement of their parts. This responds to a trenchant objection from Peter Geach who claimed that such a compositional theory is impossible. This chapter also compares the theory with metaethical expressivism...|$|E
