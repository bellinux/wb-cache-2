40|$|The classic {{theory of}} moral hazard {{concerns}} the <b>insurance</b> <b>of</b> a single <b>good</b> and predicts that co-insurance is larger when the elasticity of demand is higher and when small risks are insured. We extend this analysis to the <b>insurance</b> <b>of</b> multiple goods; for example, the simultaneous <b>insurance</b> <b>of</b> medical services and prescription drugs. We show that when multiple goods are either complements or substitutes [...] {{so that a}} change in co-insurance for one service affects the demand of others [...] the classic moral hazard results do not hold. For example, the single good model would predict high co-payments for prescription drugs since drug demand is elastic and of modest financial risk. However, a model <b>of</b> multi-good <b>insurance</b> suggests such drug coverage may optimally involve zero or even negative co-insurance when it is a substitute to other services insured such as hospital care or physician services. We summarize some of the empirical {{evidence in support of}} markets adopting optimal integrated pricing structures rather than individually optimal pricing structures. ...|$|R

Our paper focuses on this <b>insurance</b> character <b>of</b> public <b>goods.</b> As for private actions against hazardous events, one can distinguish between self-insurance (SI) and self-protection (SP) {{also in the}} context <b>of</b> public <b>goods.</b> For both cases of SI and SP we analyze efficient public provision levels as well as provision levels resulting from Nash behavior in a private provision game. An interesting aspect <b>of</b> considering public <b>goods</b> as insurance devices is the interaction with market insurance.

In the conditions of the passage to the economy based on knowledge and the continuity of the revolutionary changes in the informatics steps the informational system becomes more and more important and conditional for the survival and the performances of the entities in all areas. The administration information, the informational accounting- financial systems are closely related to the activity of the entity, by the productive action of the decision making process. For a profound study of the role and importance of the informational systems in the economic entity we must proceed to an analysis of the correlation of information, decision and action.

40|$|The {{interference}} with agriculture has been recognised {{as the main}} cause for the current conflict between farmers and wild elephants in Sri Lanka, as elsewhere in the Asian elephant range. Thus compensating farmers for the damages caused by elephants is essential, if this endangered species is {{to survive in the}} long run. This paper explores the practicality of establishing an improved publicly funded insurance/compensation scheme to recompense farmers for the elephant damages. It does so by analysing results from two contingent valuation surveys undertaken in Sri Lanka. We find that possible public support of farmers plus urban dwellers significantly exceeds the financial requirement <b>of</b> the <b>insurance</b> scheme proposed in this study for perpetuity. The article also shows that it is often inappropriate from an economic viewpoint to analyse crop insurance as if it only involves the <b>insurance</b> <b>of</b> a private <b>good</b> because important positive externalities can arise from ‘crop’ damages by wildlife, e. g. elephants. The use of agricultural land by some species is essential for their long-term survival and this is often positively valued by the community as a whole...|$|R

To analyse the estimates <b>of</b> <b>insurance</b> demand for forest <b>goods,</b> a sample <b>of</b> 224 households were selected within a four km radius from South Nandi forest. A contingent market and multiple regression techniques were used to identify the determinants <b>of</b> the natural <b>insurance</b> values. Results reveal that majority (55 %) of the respondents are willing to contribute extra money, above the normal maximum willingness to pay (WTP) amounts for improved forest products management, as guarantee for future availability of NTFPs. On average the option value of NTFPs is Sh. 2, 538 per annum, indicating the insurance premium the residents {{are willing to pay}} for continued supply of NTFPs. The main factors that influence option demand for NTFPs are education and number of children per household head. The paper recommends that the poor be allocated with tradable pasture permits to cushion them in the face of income and consumption shocks.
