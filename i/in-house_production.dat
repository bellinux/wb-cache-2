5|$|In 1993, {{after being}} fired from Uptown, Combs {{established}} his new label Bad Boy Entertainment as {{a joint venture with}} Arista Records, taking then-newcomer The Notorious B.I.G. with him. Both The Notorious B.I.G. and Craig Mack quickly released hit singles, followed by successful LPs, particularly Notorious B.I.G.'s Ready to Die. Combs signed more acts to Bad Boy, including Carl Thomas, Faith Evans, 112, Total, and Father MC. The Hitmen, his <b>in-house</b> <b>production</b> team, worked with Jodeci, Mary J. Blige, Usher, Lil' Kim, TLC, Mariah Carey, Boyz II Men, SWV, Aretha Franklin, and others. Mase and the Lox joined Bad Boy just as a widely publicized rivalry with the West Coast's Death Row Records was beginning. Combs and Notorious B.I.G. were criticized and parodied by Tupac Shakur and Suge Knight in songs and interviews during the mid-1990s. During 1994–1995, Combs produced several songs for TLC's CrazySexyCool, which finished the decade as number 25 on Billboard's list of top pop albums of the decade.|$|E

By 2004 many popular BBC One shows were made for the channel by independents, but the <b>in-house</b> <b>production</b> departments continued to contribute heavily to the schedule.|$|E

25|$|While <b>in-house</b> <b>production</b> had ceased, the BBC {{hoped to}} find an {{independent}} production company to relaunch the show. Philip Segal, a British expatriate who worked for Columbia Pictures' television arm in the United States, had approached the BBC about such a venture as early as July 1989, while the 26th series was still in production. Segal's negotiations eventually led to a Doctor Who television film, broadcast on the Fox Network in 1996 as a co-production between Fox, Universal Pictures, the BBC and BBC Worldwide. Although the film was successful in the UK (with 9.1million viewers), it was less so in the United States and {{did not lead to}} a series.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>in-house</b> <b>production</b> had ceased, the BBC were hopeful {{of finding}} an {{independent}} production company to re-launch {{the show and}} had been approached for such a venture as early as July 1989 (while the 26th series was still in production) by Philip Segal, a British expatriate who worked for Columbia Pictures' television arm in the United States. Segal's negotiations dragged on for several years, and followed him from Columbia to Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment company and finally to Universal Studios' television arm. At Amblin, Segal had come close to interesting the CBS network in commissioning the series as a mid-season replacement show in 1994, but this eventually came to nothing.|$|E
25|$|Nathan-Turner {{attempted}} to leave once {{more at the}} end of production on the twenty-fifth season in 1988, but was once again persuaded to stay for a further year after another BBC producer – Paul Stone, who had produced The Box of Delights – was offered the position but declined. He and Cartmel remained on the production team for the twenty-sixth season in 1989. Although the season once again drew praise, the viewing figures were disastrous, starting at around the 3million mark and improving to only around 4.5million by the season's conclusion. At the end of the year, Cartmel was head-hunted to script-edit the BBC's popular medical drama, Casualty, and Nathan-Turner also finally left the show, although no replacements were assigned for either position as <b>in-house</b> <b>production</b> was being shut down.|$|E

25|$|Little {{happened}} at the BBC regarding new Doctor Who production until the following year, when producer Mal Young arrived at the Corporation's <b>in-house</b> <b>production</b> arm as Head of Continuing Drama Series. Young was keen on reviving the programme, and this interest was shared by the then controller of BBC One, Peter Salmon. Tony Wood, a producer in Young's department, who previously worked at Granada Television, recalled his former colleague Russell T Davies' enthusiasm for the programme and recommended him to Young as someone who might make a good writer of a new version. Davies had recently written for the Granada dramas The Grand and Touching Evil for the ITV network, and earlier in the decade {{had worked for the}} BBC, writing the well-received children's science fiction serials Century Falls and Dark Season, which itself contained many Doctor Who-influenced themes.|$|E
25|$|The Bristol Unit has {{suffered}} {{along with the}} rest of the BBC from recent staff cuts. Yet it remains confident in the belief that the BBC will maintain it, in spite of the vagaries of fashion, because the Corporation believes that such programmes deserve a place in the schedules of any broadcaster with pretensions of providing a Public Service. In due course, similar specialist Units were also established in London, in order to produce programmes on archaeology and history, on the arts, on music and on science. They too, at one time, had their successes. But they have not survived as well as the Unit in Bristol. The statutory requirement that a certain percentage of programmes must come from independent producers has reduced <b>in-house</b> <b>production</b> and the Units necessarily shrank proportionately in size. As they dwindled, so the critical mass of their production expertise has diminished. The continuity of their archives has been broken, they have lost the close touch they once had worldwide with their subjects and they are no longer regarded internationally as the centres of innovation and expertise that they once were.|$|E
500|$|In a {{break from}} tradition, one of the ending themes of the game was not an <b>in-house</b> <b>production,</b> but Starsailor's [...] "Way To Fall".

One of his colleagues then advised him to listen to Stellastarr, but Kojima heard Starsailor. He liked the song [...] "Way To Fall", and chose it as an ending theme.|$|E

500|$|Blaxploitation was {{the first}} {{exploitation}} genre in which the major studios were central. Indeed, the United Artists release Cotton Comes to Harlem (1970), directed by Ossie Davis, {{is seen as the}} first significant film of the type. But the movie that truly ignited the blaxploitation phenomenon was completely independent: Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song (1971) is also perhaps the most outrageous example of the form: wildly experimental, borderline pornographic, and essentially a manifesto for a black American revolution. Melvin Van Peebles wrote, co-produced, directed, starred in, edited, and composed the music for the film, which was completed with a loan from Bill Cosby. Its distributor was small Cinemation Industries, then best known for releasing dubbed versions of the Italian Mondo Cane [...] "shockumentaries" [...] and the Swedish skin flick Fanny Hill, as well as for its one <b>in-house</b> <b>production,</b> The Man from O.R.G.Y. (1970). These sorts of films played in the [...] "grindhouses" [...] of the day—many of them not outright porno theaters, but rather venues for all manner of exploitation cinema. The days of six quickies for a nickel were gone, but a continuity of spirit was evident.|$|E
500|$|Rosenblatt {{contacted}} Ed Steinberg, {{who ran the}} Rock America video {{company and}} asked him if he could spare a few hours to make a music video for [...] "Everybody" [...] with Madonna on stage at her next performance in Danceteria. The idea was to play the video as promotion across the United States so that people will come to recognize an image of Madonna and her performance. Rosenblatt offered Steinberg $1,000 for the <b>in-house</b> <b>production</b> video, when artists like Duran Duran and Michael Jackson were spending six figure sums on videos. They finally agreed on $1,500. With the low-budget, the video was directed by Steinberg. Steinberg suggested shooting the video on location at the Paradise Garage, a downtown gay disco, instead of filming a live performance. Madonna's friend Debi Mazar did the makeup and joined her other backup dancers, namely Erika Belle and Bags Rilez. Mazar brought a few of her friends to act as a disco crowd in the video, including African-American graffiti artist Michael Stewart. Steinberg was impressed by Madonna's professionalism on the set and he helped to send copies of the tape to nightclubs across America which used dance music videos for their entertainment. This promotion helped the song to grow from being a dance hit in New York to a nationwide hit.|$|E
500|$|In September, Hughes and his {{corporate}} president, Ned E. Depinet, sold their RKO studio stock to a Chicago-based syndicate with {{no experience in}} the movie business. Once Hughes learned that said company had connections to organized crime, he gained near-total control of the studio in February 1953 {{at a cost of}} $23.5 million, becoming the first virtual sole owner of a studio since Hollywood's pioneer days. The studio's net loss in 1952 was over $10 million, and shooting had taken place for just a single <b>in-house</b> <b>production</b> over the last five months of the year. During the turmoil, Samuel Goldwyn ended his 11-year-long distribution deal with RKO. Wald and Krasna escaped their contracts and the studio as well. The deal that brought the team to RKO had called for them to produce sixty features over five years; in just shy of half that time, they succeeded in making four. The RKO Encino movie ranch shut down permanently in 1954 and the property was sold off. [...] Jack Webb's NBC television series Dragnet was the last project to film on the rundown movie ranch for an episode entitled [...] "The Big Producer", where the lot played the part of a crumbling [...] "Westside Studios". In November, Hughes finally fulfilled his obligations under the 1948 consent decree, divesting RKO Theatres; Albert A. List purchased the controlling interest in the business and renamed it List Industries. Hughes soon found himself the target of no less than five separate lawsuits filed by minority shareholders in RKO, accusing him of malfeasance in his dealings with the Chicago group and a wide array of acts of mismanagement. [...] "RKO's contract list is down to three actors and 127 lawyers", quipped Dick Powell of Four Star.|$|E
