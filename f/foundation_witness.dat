50|$|The name {{by which}} the town goes today is from Goar of Aquitaine, who came {{to live on the}} site where the town now stands during Frankish, Merovingian King Childebert I’s reign (511-538). Goar came as a young clergyman (actually, a monk) from Aquitaine in the {{southwest}} of France and at first lived as a hermit in a cave on the Rhine. With leave from the Bishop of Trier, he worked as a missionary to the local people. He was well known for his great hospitality, particularly towards the Rhine boatmen. Later, he built on the site where the town now stands a hospice and a chapel. Many legends gathered about him. After his death, about 575, Goar’s grave became a pilgrimage site and the place was named after him. Frankish King Pepin the Younger transferred the hospice and chapel in 765 to the Abbot of the Benedictine Prüm Abbey as a personal benefice. From this grew the Sankt Goar Canonical <b>Foundation,</b> <b>witnessed</b> as early as the late 11th century.|$|R

50|$|Remains of {{what was}} {{probably}} the ancient acropolis are still to be seen, consisting of an oblong or oval line of fortification, solidly and regularly built. The adjacent ground {{to the east and}} south is covered with <b>foundations,</b> bearing <b>witness</b> to the extent of the ancient city. In 1882, the remains of a communal tomb (polyandrion), including a colossal stone lion, were discovered on the road to Leuctra. The tomb contains both cremated remains, associated with an in-situ pyre, and seven inhumations. The tomb dates from {{the second half of the}} 5th century BC, and is usually identified as that of the Thespians who fell at the Battle of Delium in 424 BC.|$|R

50|$|Economically, {{from its}} <b>foundation,</b> Rattanakosin <b>witnessed</b> the growing role of Chinese merchants, {{a policy that}} started with king Taksin, himself {{the son of a}} Chinese merchant. Beside merchants, Chinese who were farmers, {{endlessly}} came to seek fortune in the new kingdom. The Rattanakosin's rulers welcomed the Chinese, due to their source of economic revival. Some ethnic Chinese merchants became the court officials, holding crucial positions. Chinese culture such as literature was accepted and promoted. Many Chinese works were translated by ethnic Chinese court dignitaries.Siam's relationship with the Chinese Empire was strong. Rama I claimed his blood-relation with Taksin, worrying that the Chinese court might reject his approval. The relationship was guaranteed by the tributary missions, continuing until the Rama IV's reign. Thus Chinese played a very crucial role in the revival of Rattanakosin kingdom.|$|R
5000|$|Mr Thakurdas Choithram Pagarani {{wanted to}} start a {{foundation}} called the Choithram International Foundation. He was dying of cancer. He drew up a trust deed, including himself a trustee. He travelled from his business based in Dubai and had a ceremony at his son's home in London. On 17 February 1992, with people gathered at his bedside, Mr Pagarani announced he was transferring his money to a Jersey trust for his proposed philanthropic <b>foundation.</b> <b>Witnesses</b> differed in the precise words, but the generally accepted substance as to what he was thought to have said was: [...] "I now give all my wealth to the Trust" [...] or [...] "I have given everything to the Trust". Mr Pagarani executed the trust deed in front of three trustees (who also signed), his accountant and the First Secretary of the Indian High Commission. He told the group accountant, Mr Param, that he knew what to do to transfer all balances to the foundation. There were to be three more trustees (who signed shortly afterwards), and Mr Pagarani himself was to be a seventh trustee. Those present testified that Mr Pagarani made an immediate absolute gift to the Foundation of all his shareholdings and credit balances in four British Virgin Island companies. But then he died before actually executing the documents to transfer legal title to the assets to the trustees. Some of his children contended the gift was imperfect and unenforceable. The four BVI companies in fact altered the share registers later the same day. Mr Pagarani had also prepared a will, but had not signed it. The share transfer documents were also unsigned by Mr Pagarani. The relatives who were trustees of the Foundation claimed that the gift to the Foundation was valid, and that the shares in the companies had not been transferred properly in the manner specified by law in the International Business Companies Act. Other people who stood to inherit challenged the foundation's claim.|$|R
40|$|We present Hintikka {{games for}} {{formulae}} of the proba-bilistic temporal logic PCTL and countable labeled Markov chains as models, giving an operational {{account of the}} de-notational semantics of PCTL on such models. Winning strategies have a decent degree of compositionality in the parse tree of a PCTL formula and express the precise evi-dence for truth or falsity of a PCTL formula. We also prove the existence of monotone winning strategies that are almost finitely representable. Thus this work serves as a <b>foundation</b> for <b>witness</b> and counterexample generation in probabilistic model checking and for a uniform treatment of abstraction-based probabilistic model checking through games. This work is also of independent interest as it displays a subtle interplay between Büchi acceptance conditions on infinite plays, the strictness or non-strictness of probabil-ity thresholds in Strong and Weak Until PCTL formulae in “GreaterThan ” normal form, and a finite-state approxima-tion lemma for Strong Until formulae with strict thresholds...|$|R

500|$|Writing in the New Law Journal, Chris Pamplin {{called the}} {{decision}} [...] "unprincipled" [...] {{and argued that}} the decision [...] "threatens the very <b>foundation</b> of <b>witness</b> immunity", based on an out-of-date view of the expert witness as a [...] "hired gun". [...] Pamplin's view was that the majority had [...] "ignored the fundamental difference" [...] between experts and advocates, saying that advocates {{had no choice but}} to continue in the legal system whereas experts could continue their ordinary work without needing to carry on as an expert witness. [...] Therefore, experts would be more likely to abandon such work than advocates, making them more vulnerable to vexatious litigation. [...] However, he said it would make [...] "little immediate difference" [...] for many experts, since [...] "conscientious professionals" [...] would have little worry about being found negligent and would have insurance in case they were. The ruling would also help develop a [...] "professional class of expert", making it less likely that people would contribute expertise occasionally, and although a professional expert witness would have a better knowledge of their role and duties, this would be at the expense of [...] "freshness and challenge to dogma".|$|R

[...] In the same issue, the newspaper's K <b>Foundation</b> art award <b>witness,</b> Robert Sandall, wrote that the Foundation's award, million-pound artwork and the burning were all [...] "entertaining, and satirically quite sharp", but [...] "the art world has chosen not to think .... The general view remains that the K Foundation's preoccupation with money, though undoubtedly sincere, simply isn't very original. Although they didn't blow their entire life's savings along the way, other artists, notably Yves Klein and Chris Burden, have been here before." ...|$|R
2500|$|Combermere Abbey was {{the earlier}} {{of the two}} great Cistercian abbeys in Cheshire, the other being Vale Royal. The abbey was {{dedicated}} to the Virgin Mary and Saint Michael, and originally belonged to the Savigniac order, which merged with the Cistercian order by 1147. Hugh Malbank, the second Baron of Wich Malbank (now Nantwich), was the founder, and the original donation occurred early in the 12th century. It was confirmed in 1130 by Ranulf de Gernons (also Ranulf II), the fourth Earl of Chester, {{who was one of}} the [...] <b>witnesses</b> of its <b>foundation</b> charter. Other <b>witnesses</b> included Hugh Malbank's son, William, and Roger de Clinton, the Bishop of Coventry. Building of the abbey commenced slightly later, possibly in 1133, often stated as the date of foundation. The site given for the monastery buildings was a wooded area by the large lake of Comber Mere, a peaceful and isolated location near the Shropshire border, suitable for the austere Savigniac order. Little or nothing is known of the early abbey buildings. The first abbot was named William.|$|R

This form of reporting will {{be examined in}} two publications of the religious left as contrasted with the New York Times. The thesis is that, more than any technology, WTDS consists of the journalist’s moral commitment and narrative skills and the audience’s analytical resources and trust. In the religious journals, liberation theology provides the moral commitment, the writers and editors the narrative skills and trust and the special vision of the newly empowered poor the analytical <b>foundation.</b> In bearing <b>witness</b> {{to those who have}} suffered state or guerilla terrorism in El Salvador and Nicaragua during the 1980 s, we will investigate a distinction between “worthy” and “unworthy victims. ” This last issue has a special ethical and political significance.
