In this study, we demonstrate that selenium supplementation can effectively increase glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity in latently infected T lymphocytes. The Se-supplemented cells exhibited an important protection against the cytotoxic and reactivating effects of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2). Concomitantly, NF-kappa B activation by H 2 O 2 was also decreased in Se-supplemented cells. Selenium stimulation of GPx activity also induces a protective effect against cell activation by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) but less significantly by phorbol esters such as PMA. These Se-mediated effects were specific {{because they were not}} found when AP- 1 DNA-binding activity was studied after H 2 O 2 -induced stress. Hyperthermia was also studied because it could promote intracellular <b>electron</b> <b>leakage</b> <b>in</b> electron transport chains.

The measured mobility corresponds to electron transport through the X-conduction band. We show that the drift component of the leakage current reduces the differential efficiency and is responsible for the decrease in external differential efficiency with increasing temperature. Because the leakage occurs by a mixture of drift and diffusion, the transit time does not decrease significantly with increasing drive current; however the impact of leakage on the modulation response is predicted to be very small unless the leakage becomes a substantial fraction of the total current...|$|E

The fibers were analyzed for mitochondrial respiration, H 2 O 2 production and citrate synthase (CS) activity. A multi-substrate (glycerol phosphate (G 3 P), pyruvate, malate, glutamate and succinate) approach was used to analyze the mitochondria in permeabilized fibers. Compared to the control group, oxygen flow coupled to ATP synthesis, complex I and complex II was higher in the TA of the HIIT group by 1. 5 -, 3. 0 - and 2. 7 -fold, respectively. In contrast, oxygen consumed by mitochondrial glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase (mGPdH) was 30 % lower. Surprisingly, the oxygen flow coupled to ATP synthesis was 42 % lower after HIIT in the SOL. Moreover, oxygen flow coupled to ATP synthesis and complex II was higher by 1. 4 - and 2. 7 -fold in the GAST of the HIIT group.

40|$|PCB 126 is {{the most}} potent agonist of the aryl {{hydrocarbon}} receptor (AhR) in the whole family of chlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), a class of persistent organic pollutants that are classified as probable human carcinogens. It exerts systematic toxicities in animals mainly through the AhR pathway and generates cellular oxidative stress which might damage cellular macromolecules. The goal of this thesis is to elucidate the mechanisms of PCB 126 toxicity in the aspect of AhR-related oxidative stress. Reactive superoxide radicals could be generated {{as the result of}} <b>electron</b> <b>leakage</b> <b>in</b> the catalytic cycles of cytochrome P 450 (CYP) enzymes which are super-induced by sustained AhR activation in response to PCB 126. In addition, the disruption of mitochondrial electron transport chain caused by AhR ligands also contributes to the production of superoxide radicals. Correspondingly in this thesis, the impact of PCB 126 on the expression of the recently-discovered, TCDD-inducible microsomal CYP 2 S 1 enzyme was studied. Then the regulation of mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme MnSOD in response to PCB 126 was investigated. Lastly, a microarray study on classic AhR ligands of β-naphthoflavone and 3 -methylcholanthrene was conducted to explore possible mechanisms of AhR-associated toxicities and to find explanations for the regulation of CYP 2 S 1 as well as MnSOD after PCB 126 exposure. It was found that CYP 2 S 1 was only weakly or not at all regulated by PCB 126 in rats. As for MnSOD, although its messenger and protein levels were induced by PCB 126, its enzymatic activity was significantly reduced in the liver, probably through post-translational mechanisms. Although dietary manganese supplementation did not reverse the loss of MnSOD activity due to PCB 126 exposure, it significantly protected against liver hypertrophy caused by PCB 126. Microarray study results were consistent with previous findings and indicated that in addition to changed expression of a number of CYPs, metal homeostasis as well as mitochondria functions were also affected by AhR ligands. Overall, both CYP enzymes and the mitochondria contribute to the AhR-mediated toxicities of PCB 126 that are associated with a disturbance of cellular redox homeostasis...|$|E

Using photoacoustic spectroscopy, we detected an oxygen-dependent, PSI-mediated energy storage activity in the ΔpsaE null mutant, which was not present in the wild type (WT). The expression of the genes encoding catalase (katG) and iron superoxide dismutase (sodB) was upregulated in the ΔpsaE mutant, and the increase in katG expression was correlated with an increase in catalase activity of the cells.

The effect of high membrane potential is thought to have a similar effect.

The polar c-plane LED (c-LED) {{suffers from a}} well-known efficiency droop, i.e., quantum efficiency reaching maximum at a very low current density and then gradual reduction under a higher injected current [3 – 13]. Polarization effects induced quantum-confined Stark effect (QCSE) [3 – 8], <b>electron</b> <b>leakage</b> [9, 10], poor hole injection efficiency [11 – 13], and nonuniform hole distribution among the quantum wells have been suggested to explain the origin of efficiency droop. Auger recombination [14, 15] and carrier delocalization from indium-rich regions to dislocations [16] have also been proposed. The growth of III-nitrides along the nonpolar m- and a-axes [11, 17, 18], semipolar axis [19], and -c-axis (nitrogen-polar) [20] can overcome polarization effects. Without polarization effects in a nonpolar m-plane LED (m-LED), more uniform hole distribution among the wells and suppressed electron overflow out of the electron blocking layer can significantly reduce the <b>electron</b> <b>leakage</b> current and efficiency droop [11].

Therefore, we show the measured EL spectra for LEDs A and B in a semi-log scale (see Fig.  3 c) to indicate the detailed information regarding the parasitic luminescence. The peak emission wavelength for the parasitic luminescence is centered at ~[*] 425  nm, which may arise from the deep levels associated with Mg dopants [26]. The intensity of the parasitic luminescence for LED B is stronger than that for LED A, and it is speculated that more carriers recombine at the deep levels. In our experiment, the p-type hole injection layers for both DUV LED architectures are not engineered, and the hole concentration level in the hole injection layers shall be similar. Therefore, it is identified that electrons that escape from the MQW region possess a higher concentration in the hole injection layer for LED B than those for LED A. Our suggestions are further supported by Fig.  3 d that shows the electron concentration profiles in the p-type hole injection layers for LEDs A and B at the current density of 50  A/cm 2.
