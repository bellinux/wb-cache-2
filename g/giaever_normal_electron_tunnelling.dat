40|$|Using {{cryogenic}} scanning tunnelling microscopy and scanning tunnelling spectroscopy {{we measured}} single <b>electron</b> <b>tunnelling</b> of isolated Au nanoparticles with 1. 4 nm in radius. We observe that a gap ΔV 2 e/C (C is the capacitance of the Au particle) around zero {{bias in the}} tunnelling conductance spectrum, followed {{by a series of}} discrete single <b>electron</b> <b>tunnelling</b> peaks with voltage widths of EC e/C at both negative and positive bias. Experimental data are well explained by taking into account the effect of exchange interaction of electrons on the single <b>electron</b> <b>tunnelling</b> of Au nanoparticles.

With a bias voltage U, <b>electrons</b> <b>tunnel</b> preferentially to the positive electrode. With the assumption that spin is conserved during tunneling, the current can be described in a two-current model. The total current is split in two partial currents, one for the spin-up electrons and another for the spin-down electrons. These vary depending on the magnetic state of the junctions.|$|R
40|$|Electron {{transport}} {{through a}} nanoscale system is an inherently stochastic quantum mechanical process. Electric current {{is a time}} series of electron tunneling events separated by random intervals. Thermal and quantum noise are two sources of this randomness. In this paper we use the quantum master equation to consider the following questions. (i) Given that an <b>electron</b> has <b>tunneled</b> into the electronically unoccupied system from the source electrode at some particular time, {{how long is it}} until an <b>electron</b> <b>tunnels</b> out to the drain electrode to leave the system electronically unoccupied, where there are no intermediate tunneling events (the tunneling path) ? (ii) Given that an <b>electron</b> <b>tunneled</b> into the unoccupied system from the source electrode at some particular time, how long is it until an <b>electron</b> <b>tunnels</b> out to the drain electrode to leave the system electronically unoccupied, where there are no intermediate tunneling events (a tunneling path) ?

At zero source-drain bias the single electron transistor displays both resistive (Sisyphus resistance) and reactive (tunnelling capacitance) components to its impedance.

5000|$|Due to the discreteness of {{electrical}} charge, current through a tunnel junction {{is a series}} of events in which exactly one <b>electron</b> passes (<b>tunnels)</b> through the tunnel barrier (we neglect cotunneling, in which two <b>electrons</b> <b>tunnel</b> simultaneously). The tunnel junction capacitor is charged with one elementary charge by the <b>tunnelling</b> <b>electron,</b> causing a voltage buildup , where [...] is the elementary charge of 1.6×10−19 coulomb and [...] the capacitance of the junction. If the capacitance is very small, the voltage buildup can be large enough to prevent another <b>electron</b> from <b>tunnelling.</b> The electric current is then suppressed at low bias voltages and the resistance of the device is no longer constant. The increase of the differential resistance around zero bias is called the Coulomb blockade.|$|R

40|$|A {{mesoscopic}} spin valve is used {{to determine}} the effective spin polarization of electrons tunneling from and into ferromagnetic transition metals at finite voltages. The tunneling spin polarization from the ferromagnet (FM) slowly decreases with bias, but drops faster and even inverts with voltage when <b>electrons</b> <b>tunnel</b> into it. A bias-dependent free electron model shows that in the former case electrons originate near the Fermi level of the FM with large polarization whereas in the latter, <b>electrons</b> <b>tunnel</b> into hot <b>electron</b> states for which the polarization is significantly reduced.

40|$|Developments {{in theory}} and {{experiment}} have raised {{the prospect of an}} electronic technology based on the discrete nature of <b>electron</b> <b>tunnelling</b> through a potential barrier. This thesis deals with novel design and analysis tools developed to study such systems. Possible devices include those constructed from ultrasmall normal tunnelling junctions. These exhibit charging effects including the Coulomb blockade and correlated <b>electron</b> <b>tunnelling.</b> They allow transistor-like control of the transfer of single carriers, and present the prospect of digital systems operating at the information theoretic limit. As such, they are often referred to as single electronic devices. Single electronic devices exhibit self quantising logic and good structural tolerance. Their speed, immunity to thermal noise, and operating voltage all scale beneficially with junction capacitance. For ultrasmall junctions the possibility of room temperature operation at sub picosecond timescales seems feasible. However, they are sensitive to external charge; whether from trapping-detrapping events, externally gated potentials, or system cross-talk. Quantum effects such as charge macroscopic quantum tunnelling may degrade performance. Finally, any practical system will be complex and spatially extended (amplifying the above problems), and prone to fabrication imperfection. This summarises why new design and analysis tools are required. Simulation tools are developed, concentrating on the basic building blocks of single electronic systems; the tunnelling junction array and gated turnstile device. Three main points are considered: the best method of estimating capacitance values from physical system geometry; the mathematical model which should represent <b>electron</b> <b>tunnelling</b> based on this data; application of this model to the investigation of single electronic systems.
