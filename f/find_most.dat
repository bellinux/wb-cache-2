5|$|During the {{ceremony}} of initiation, the candidate {{is expected to}} swear (usually on a volume of sacred text appropriate to his personal religious faith) to fulfil certain obligations as a Mason. In the course of three degrees, new masons will promise to keep the secrets of their degree from lower degrees and outsiders, and to support a fellow Mason in distress (as far as practicality and the law permit). There is instruction as to the duties of a Freemason, but on the whole, Freemasons are left to explore the craft in the manner they <b>find</b> <b>most</b> satisfying. Some will further explore the ritual and symbolism of the craft, others will focus their involvement on the social side of the Lodge, while still others will concentrate on the charitable functions of the lodge.|$|E
5|$|Pembleton (Andre Braugher) {{continues}} his {{investigation into the}} shooting death of small-time drug peddler Charles Courtland Cox, who he suspects was killed by police during a botched crackhouse raid. As the involved police officers turn over their guns for testing, the press reports heavily on the story, which results in pressure from the department heads to solve the case. Pembleton aggressively questions several officers, but none are cooperative. Gee (Yaphet Kotto) is angry with Pembleton's focus on the police and demands civilian suspects be pursued. Howard (Melissa Leo) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) canvas the neighborhood of the shooting and <b>find</b> <b>most</b> residents do not trust the police, who they feel are {{responsible for the death of}} one of their own. However, one woman named Dale (June Thorne) tells Bayliss her grandson, Lane Staley (Isaiah Washington) witnessed the shooting. Staley is brought in to the station for questioning and, while Pembleton plans to question him as an eyewitness, Gee demands he be treated as a suspect.|$|E

25|$|The vocalizations {{that male}} frogs use {{to call for}} females are crucial for {{reproductive}} success in frogs. Initially, male frogs will produce advertisement calls, considered a pre-mating isolating mechanism because females use them to isolate conspecific males, as cited in which convey information about species, sexual readiness, and size, with females moving towards the call they <b>find</b> <b>most</b> attractive. In Hyla versicolor, females favor long calls rather than short calls while in Dendropsophus microcephalus they are attracted to short and high rate calling.|$|E
25|$|Until the mid-20th century, it was {{not readily}} {{apparent}} {{at the time of}} discovery whether a body has been buried in a bog for years, decades, or centuries. But, modern forensic and medical technologies (such as radiocarbon dating) have been developed that allow researchers to more closely determine the age of the burial, the person's age at death, and other details. Scientists have been able to study the skin of the bog bodies, reconstruct their appearance and even determine what their last meal was from their stomach contents since peat marsh preserves soft internal tissue. Their teeth also indicate their age at death and what type of food they ate throughout their lifetime. Subsurface radar can be used by archaeologists to detect bodies and artifacts beneath the bog surface before cutting into the peat. Radiocarbon dating is also common as it accurately gives the date of the <b>find,</b> <b>most</b> usually from the Iron Age.|$|E

25|$|Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a first-person shooter video game. The {{player can}} perform several actions, {{including}} jump, sprint, crouch, lay prone, and aim down their gun's iron sights. When the player is shot by an enemy, blood will splatter their heads-up display (HUD), denoting {{that they have}} taken damage; if the player avoids gunfire by taking cover, then their health will recover. The HUD also displays other information, such as a compass, a mini-map, and the player's current ammunition count. The game features traditional guns, including assault rifles, shotguns, handguns, and sniper rifles. The player will be given specific guns {{at the beginning of}} each level, but may switch them out with another gun they <b>find.</b> <b>Most</b> guns have attachments, such as suppressors, and heartbeat sensors. The player can also use grenades and flashbangs when faced with a large group of enemies, as well as a knife for close quarters combat. In some levels, the player will be given special equipment, such as night vision goggles, or a laser designator.|$|E
25|$|The revolutionaries are chased {{into the}} hills by an army {{detachment}} led by Colonel Günther Reza. John and Juan volunteer to stay behind with two machine guns and dynamite. Much of the army's detachment is destroyed while crossing a bridge, which is blown up by John. Colonel Reza, who commands an armoured car, survives. After the battle, John and Juan <b>find</b> <b>most</b> of their comrades, including Juan's father and children, {{have been killed by}} the army in a cave. Grief-stricken and enraged, Juan goes out to fight the army single-handed and is captured. John sneaks into camp, where he witnesses executions of many of his fellow revolutionaries by firing squad. They had been informed on by Dr. Villega, who has been tortured by Colonel Reza and his men. This evokes in John memories of a similar betrayal by Nolan, his best friend in Ireland. Nolan's betrayal forced John to kill him and two British soldiers, making him a fugitive and forcing him to flee Ireland. Juan faces a firing squad of his own, but John arrives and blows up the wall with dynamite just in time. They escape on John's motorcycle.|$|E
25|$|In 1712 {{when the}} War of the Spanish Succession was turning against Habsburg Austria, Prince Eugene of Savoy cast {{about for a}} way for his shaken troops to gain a success. He heard that the {{garrison}} of Fort de Knocque was weak and its security was lax. Eugene called for a partisan named La Rue, told him his plan to surprise the garrison and instructed him to call on the governor of Ostend to give him whatever help he needed. At the same time Eugene alerted Lieutenant General Robert Murray at Lille to hold some troops ready {{to assist in the}} coup. La Rue's free company and some troops from Ostend stealthily took position in gardens near the fort where they caught and killed two sentries. La Rue disguised several of his men as peasants with their loaded weapons concealed in a cart. Appearing before the fort, they called out that they wanted to sell their wares to the officers and were admitted. The first group of partisans seized the door to the fort. After that, it was easy for a second disguised group to burst into the fort to <b>find</b> <b>most</b> of the officers and men inside their barracks. A few men raised the alarm but they were rapidly subdued at sword and bayonet point. When Murray arrived, he found the garrison prisoners of war. The general put a Dutch garrison into the fort and returned to Lille.|$|E

500|$|The {{nature of}} PewDiePie's video content has been {{described}} by various outlets as goofy, energetic, obnoxious and filled with profanity. However, many of the same outlets concede that PewDiePie's content is genuine and unfiltered. Sarah Begley of Time said his clips contained [...] "charismatic narration". Chris Reed of The Wall St. Cheat Sheet said it contained [...] "off-the-cuff running commentary that's characterised by goofy jokes, profanity and loud outbursts." [...] Walker wrote PewDiePie's [...] "chosen mode of sharing his critique happens to be ribald entertainment, an unmediated stream of blurted jokes, startled yelps, goofy voices, politically incorrect comments and pretty much nonstop profanity." [...] Reed adds that these aspects of PewDiePie's videos are what critics <b>find</b> <b>most</b> abrasive, but what fans love the most. PewDiePie resorts occasionally to gameplay, resulting in silent or emotional commentary; his playthrough of The Last of Us, it was detailed, left the usually vocal gamer speechless at the ending.|$|E
500|$|According to {{zoologist}} and conservationist Sheila Conant, A. brownii {{is important}} {{due to its}} uniqueness in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands as [...] "the only Hawaiian endemic in this large genus which contains many economically and nutritionally important species." [...] However, {{in more than a}} decade of field surveys on Nihoa, no living plants have been identified. Wildlife refuge staff have visited the island during the dry season at least 21 times between 1983 and 1996. The absence of the plant in recent field surveys might be explained by the time of visit. Because winter surveys of Nihoa tend to be difficult and dangerous due to poor landing conditions, surveys have not been conducted during the moist, winter growing season from December through March when the plant is easiest to <b>find.</b> <b>Most</b> of the surveys have been completed during the summer months, when it is easiest to visit Nihoa, but during this time, the stems of A. brownii dry up and cannot be distinguished from other herbaceous plants. A seven-day visit to the island in April 2006 still did not find any specimens but botanists are optimistic that the species has survived. Additional winter surveys are required to accurately assess the conservation status of the plant.|$|E
500|$|Though Hemmings did {{not think}} of his work as a biography, Richard L. Hopkins (Comparative Education Review) said it {{essentially}} was strongest as one. Hopkins wrote in 1976 that Hemmings's book was the best biography of Neill available at the time, and called it [...] "comprehensive", [...] "objective", and [...] "sympathetically thoughtful". In comparison, Neill's autobiography [...] "rambles" [...] and Skidelsky's biography [...] "preens" [...] over [...] "small insights", while Hemmings unpacks larger issues to contextualize [...] "a complex man in a complex world". Reflecting on these three biographies of Neill, Hopkins added that Hemmings's book would interest [...] "comparative educators" [...] most, as that it addressed the two points readers would <b>find</b> <b>most</b> interesting about Neill: the role of his history on his ideas, and the role of his ideas in the outside world. Still, Hopkins thought many readers would find the work [...] "too long and detailed". Hopkins himself found Hemmings's book [...] "a struggle to work through", though more complete compared to Neill's [...] "easy", [...] "stream-of-consciousness" [...] prose. Leonard W. Cowie (British Journal of Educational Studies) said that Fifty Years was written with [...] "great competence" [...] and would be both [...] "interesting and essential" [...] for those interested in understanding Neill. [...] recommended the [...] "excellent volume" [...] for [...] "all readership levels", and considered it more telling than Neill's own autobiography. Shelley Neiderbach (Library Journal) agreed that Hemmings's [...] "admiring ... historical biography" [...] remained [...] "clear, cool, and evenhanded". [...] Sarah Curtis (The Times Literary Supplement) wrote in 1972 that Hemmings's account of Neill was [...] "the most lucid, dispassionate yet sympathetic" [...] published. No system, she wrote, has reconciled the needs for individual freedom and societal regulation.|$|E
