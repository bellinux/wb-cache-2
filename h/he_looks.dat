5|$|Firstly, he {{reviews the}} {{evidence}} about how serious {{the situation is}} already and how much worse it will get. Secondly, he examines the roots of denial, {{both in terms of}} resistance to the evidence and in relation to the actors and agencies motivated to deny climate change. Lastly, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> at some future scenarios and explains what people should do.|$|E
5|$|Mehldau has {{expressed}} an interest in, and knowledge of, philosophy and literature. In a 2003 interview he commented on romanticism and nostalgia, linking pleasure and pain to musical expression: I love {{the part of the}} Orpheus myth where he is allowed to take his wife out of Hades on the condition that he doesn't look back at her for the trip on the river Styx. When he can't help himself, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> back, and she is pulled back downstream away from him, taken away forever. Music is that moment right when <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> at her: seeing something that you love for an instant being taken away forever. There's an element of folly to the whole thing – you look even though you know you shouldn't. Music kind of yokes together the feeling of attainment and the feeling of loss at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Black {{doubts that}} Winston is the killer, and while Hollis {{stays in the}} hotel, he visits the production's climactic shoot, set during a {{performance}} by the band Kiss. As <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> around him, the sheriff's body is thrown down from the rafters; as the pandemonium settles, Black realizes that horror films end with the leading lady being targeted—the killer is after Hollis. Racing back to her hotel, Black discover Hollis fending off a chainsaw-wielding Bianco. Black is able to subdue Bianco after Hollis disables the chainsaw; the actor then explains that he lacked Black's insight and had to commit the crimes {{in order to see}} {{through the eyes of a}} killer.|$|E

60|$|The King {{went and}} looked at both the dappled horses; <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> high and <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> low, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> before and <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> behind, but {{there was not a}} hair's {{difference}} between the two.|$|R

5|$|Crane {{starts to}} believe that a {{conspiracy}} links all the deaths together, so <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> into Van Garrett's last will. Van Garrett had made a new will just before he died, leaving all his possessions to his secret new bride, Emily Winship, whom Crane discovers was pregnant with Van Garrett's child. Crane deduces that all who knew about the new will, the marriage and the pregnancy were the victims of the Horseman and that Katrina's father Baltus Van Tassel (Michael Gambon), who would have inherited the fortune, is the person holding the skull. Katrina, finding out that Crane suspects her father, burns all the evidence that Crane has accumulated.|$|E
5|$|He {{considers}} the forces such as surface tension acting on cells, and Plateau's experiments on soap films. He illustrates {{the way a}} splash breaks into droplets and compares this to the shapes of Campanularian zoophytes (Hydrozoa). <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> at the flask-like shapes of single-celled organisms such as species of Vorticella, considering teleological and physical explanations of their having minimal areas; and at the hanging drop shapes of some Foraminifera such as Lagena. He argues that the cells of trypanosomes are similarly shaped by surface tension.|$|E
5|$|In the {{forensics}} laboratory, Arun {{discovers that}} the body is not Susanna's; however, he declares Susanna dead in his reports. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> for her; when he finds Susanna, she tells him she is finally getting married {{the next day to}} someone who accepts her, knowing all her sins. In an epiphany she imagines Jesus Christ as her seventh husband, full of love and never hurtful; she becomes a nun and finding the love she sought all her life. Arun and Nandini return home after he tells her that Susanna is dead.|$|E

6000|$|The man's {{face was}} not an {{agreeable}} study. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> angry; <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> baffled; and yet <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> incredulous. [...] "Now, come," [...] said he, [...] "if you are not Keswick, what did you pay me that money for?" ...|$|R
5|$|In the present, {{during the}} re-dedication ceremony, Mulder realizes {{that no one}} can see Teager if they are in his line of sight. Teager follows Skinner and Bloch to the motorcade, where he unsuccessfully shoots at the general and Skinner suffers a flesh wound. Teager is shot in turn by the agents as he tries to escape. As he succumbs to his wounds, Teager repeats his Army identification. Afterwards, the Pentagon states that the assassin was a {{different}} person—which Mulder denounces as a lie. He leaves Skinner to silently ponder his own service in the Vietnam War as <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> upon Teager's name on the memorial wall.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{meets with}} Margaret Scully in a park, {{and tries to}} give her Scully's {{necklace}}. Margaret returns the necklace to Mulder, asking that he give it to Scully when he finds her. Margaret also says {{that she had the}} dream again about losing her daughter; Mulder takes this as a hopeful sign that Scully may still be alive. A mournful Mulder later returns to Skyland Mountain, to the field where Scully was abducted. Seemingly alone without her, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> up into the stars.|$|E
5|$|Ruby is then {{seen in a}} {{hospital}} bed, with Kevin by her side. When questioned about her experience, {{she says she was}} told by an unnamed group not to say anything. Darlene also refuses to cooperate any further, given the ridicule that she faced after her experiences. Back in Washington, Scully listens to a tape of hypnotic sessions in which Mulder recalls the night his sister vanished. Mulder, meanwhile, sits in a church, crying as <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> at a picture of his sister.|$|E

5|$|The next day, many {{survivors}} in the island's camp are stressed, including Sullivan (Scott Paulin), who is diagnosed with hives by Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox). John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) {{and his new}} hunting companion, Ethan Rom (William Mapother), give some newly found luggage to Hurley; <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> through it and finds golf clubs. The next morning, Hurley builds a golf course to improve morale amongst the survivors. Jack, Charlie, and Michael decide to join him, and eventually around twenty people, including Kate and Sawyer, arrive to participate.|$|E
5|$|The {{third section}} {{discusses}} {{the rulers of}} secular society and their flaws. The fourth, which is a formal section, deploys a series of Baroque paradoxes {{in the context of}} the Good Friday mass. This past manner is regarded ironically by the poet in the fifth section as <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> back on his period of experimentation in 'the years of l'entre deux guerres as 'largely wasted'. He welcomes approaching old age as a new opportunity to find renewal, although it might only be a rediscovery of 'what has been lost and found and lost again'.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus {{describes}} {{trees and}} shrubs from different places and habitats, as for instance a sheltered part of the Arcadia region near Krane in a deep valley where the sun never reaches, and the silver-fir trees are exceptionally tall. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> into the plants of Egypt, Libya, Asia, northern regions, and then aquatic plants from the Mediterranean, wetlands especially in Egypt, reeds and rushes. He also considers factors that limit the life of plants including diseases and weather damage.|$|E
6000|$|Grandfather Frog {{cleared his}} throat. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> {{to the east}} and cleared his throat again. Then <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> to the west, and cleared his throat. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> north and <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> south, and each time he cleared his throat, but said nothing. Finally he folded his hands once more over his white and yellow waistcoat, and looking {{straight}} up at jolly, round, red Mr. Sun he remarked in his very deepest Voice and to no one in particular: ...|$|R
60|$|There was no reply. The {{door was}} pushed open. Quest entered, {{followed}} by the Professor and Craig. The Inspector stood watching their faces.

5|$|Thirteen {{years before}} the present, Robert Fassl (W. Earl Brown) sits in his van. He later {{approaches}} a home and claims {{to be there to}} repair the cable. As Fassl holds up a piece of paper to show it to the family who called for the repair, blood spatter splashes across the paper. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> up and sees the house's occupants with slit throats in pools of blood. Abruptly, two police officers burst into the house and apprehend Fassl. One of the officers who goes to check out the kitchen turns to reveal he is John Doggett (Robert Patrick) as a young NYPD officer.|$|E
5|$|As {{the years}} pass, the rural area {{gives way to}} a more {{urbanized}} setting. New buildings and highways spring up, more housing developments are built, and the farmers are pushed out. Though much of the wildlife has left and hunting grows increasingly difficult, Tod stays because it is his home range. The other foxes that remain become unhealthy scavengers, and their natures changelife-bonds with their mates are replaced by promiscuity, couples going their separate ways once the mating act is over. The Master has lost most of his own land, and the only dog he owns now is Copper. Each winter they still hunt Tod, and {{in an odd way}} <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> forward to it as the only aspect of his old life that remains.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{understudy}} rehearsal, Jim's fiancée Laura (the understudy for Lady Macbeth) {{helps him}} learn lines in Tony's dressing room. Company manager Felicity arrives and scolds them {{for using the}} room. While Jim is absent, Felicity flirts with Laura. Laura asks Tony's dresser, Kirstie, what he earns, before opening Tony's payslip to see for herself. She is determined for Jim to appear as Macbeth, which {{would allow them to}} save for their wedding. Laura cuts herself on a pin that Kirstie left in the Lady Macbeth dress, and after she and Kirstie leave the room, Jim sees a drop of blood on the floor grow into a large puddle. When <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> again, it has gone.|$|E
5000|$|Fred Williamson {{was cast}} in the lead. Cohen says, [...] "Fred was totally {{different}} than what Sammy would have played, because Fred was a handsome leading man. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> great in the clothes, and <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> great in that hat that I put on him.

5|$|Despite Bowser's demise in {{the first}} level, this does not stop Bowser Jr. from running through the {{remaining}} worlds with Peach in tow, forcing Mario to chase after him before reaching Bowser's castle in world 8. There, Bowser Jr. revives his father's skeleton, creating Dry Bowser, but Mario once again defeats Bowser by dropping him into a deep pit. In the final battle, Bowser Jr. flees once more across a lava chasm to a larger castle, where he throws his father's bones into a cauldron and revives Bowser in his original form. They attack Mario in tandem, but Mario drops the pair into the pit below. In the game's final sequence, Mario rescues Peach, who kisses him on the cheek. Over the end credits, Bowser Jr. is seen dragging his unconscious father across the floor. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> at the screen, and growls, breaking the fourth wall.|$|E
5|$|In 2010's {{video game}} , the Queen (voiced by Kyoko Satomi in Japanese and Susanne Blakeslee in English) {{appears in the}} Dwarf Woodlands world. She {{recruits}} the protagonist Terra to kill Snow White and bring back her heart in return for allowing him to use the Magic Mirror to locate Master Xehanort. Terra, like the huntsman, ultimately does not go through with this, and the Queen, learning of his betrayal, forces the Mirror to consume him, but Terra manages to fight the Mirror off and the Queen reluctantly gives him the information <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> for. She later appears briefly in Ventus's scenario, where she crosses paths with him {{on her way to}} poison Snow White. She drops the poisoned apple, which Ventus returns to her. She notices Ventus's Keyblade and muses that Terra threatened her with a similar weapon. She is then only briefly mentioned in Aqua's storyline, when the Magic Mirror tells Aqua that the Queen is dead and he is no longer under her control.|$|E
5|$|South Carolina Congressman Frank Underwood (Kevin Spacey), the Democratic Majority Whip, {{leaves his}} house in Washington, D.C. after hearing his neighbors’ dog {{get hit by a}} car. As he comforts the mortally-wounded dog, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> into the camera and says “Moments like this require someone who will act, who will do the {{unpleasant}} thing, the necessary thing,” before calmly proceeding to strangle it. This introduces both his habit of breaking the fourth wall to narrate, and his cold and vicious nature. Frank and his wife, Claire (Robin Wright), go on to attend a New Year’s Eve party in honor of the new President-elect, Garrett Walker (Michel Gill), a fellow Democrat and winner of the 2012 election. Frank confesses to the viewer that he does not like Walker, but saw his political potential early on and ingratiated himself to him, putting himself in line to be nominated as Walker’s Secretary of State after 22 years in Congress.|$|E
