40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: To {{the best}} of our knowledge, only 52 cases of {{squamous}} cell carcinoma (SCC) complicating hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) have been reported since 1958. We describe 13 new cases. METHODS: We propose a clinical and histological analysis of our cases. We include these results in a review of previously reported cases to analyze a total of 65 patients. In our series of 13 cases, we also investigate the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) in tumor samples, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on paraffin-embedded material. RESULTS: Malignant transformation affects mainly men with a long-term history of genitoanal HS. Although our cases were 7 well-differentiated carcinomas and 6 verrucous carcinomas, lymphatic and visceral metastasis occurred in 2 and 3 cases, respectively. With PCR, we demonstrated presence of HPV in genitoanal tumoral lesions, principally HPV- 16. CONCLUSION: SCC complicating HS evolves poorly, despite a good <b>histological</b> <b>prognosis.</b> Our results sustain the implication of HPV in the malignant transformation of HS...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Intracranial {{pediatric}} {{germ cell}} tumors (GCTs) are rare and heterogeneous neoplasms and vary in <b>histological</b> differentiation, <b>prognosis</b> and clinical behavior. Germinoma and mature teratoma are GCTs {{that have a}} good prognosis, while other types of GCTs, termed nongerminomatous malignant germ cell tumors (NGMGCTs), are tumors with an intermediate or poor prognosis. The second group of tumors requires more extensive drug and irradiation treatment regimens. The mechanisms underlying the differences in incidence and prognosis of the various GCT subgroups are unclear. Results We identified a distinct mRNA profile correlating with GCT <b>histological</b> differentiation and <b>prognosis,</b> and also present in this study the first miRNA profile of pediatric primary intracranial GCTs. Most of the differentially expressed miRNAs were downregulated in germinomas, but miR- 142 - 5 p and miR- 146 a were upregulated. Genes responsible for self-renewal (such as POU 5 F 1 (OCT 4), NANOG and KLF 4) and the immune response were abundant in germinomas, while genes associated with neuron differentiation, Wnt/β-catenin pathway, invasiveness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (including SNAI 2 (SLUG) and TWIST 2) were abundant in NGMGCTs. Clear transcriptome segregation based on patient survival was observed, with malignant NGMGCTs being closest to embryonic stem cells. Chromosome copy number variations (CNVs) at cytobands 4 q 13. 3 - 4 q 28. 3 and 9 p 11. 2 - 9 q 13 correlated with GCT malignancy and clinical risk. Six genes (BANK 1, CXCL 9, CXCL 11, DDIT 4 L, ELOVL 6 and HERC 5) within 4 q 13. 3 - 4 q 28. 3 were more abundant in germinomas. Conclusions Our results integrate molecular profiles with clinical observations and provide insights into the underlying mechanisms causing GCT malignancy.

40|$|Epithelial {{ovarian cancer}} (EOC) {{is a complex}} disease, with {{multiple}} histological subtypes recognized. There have been major advances {{in the understanding of}} the cellular and molecular biology of this human malignancy, however the survival rate of women with epithelial ovarian cancer has changed little since platinum based-treatment was introduced more than 30 years ago. Since 2006, an increasing number of studies have indicated an essential role for microRNAs in ovarian cancer tumorigenesis. Several microRNA profiling studies have shown that they associate with different aspects of ovarian cancer (tumor subtype, stage, <b>histological</b> grade, <b>prognosis</b> and therapy resistance) and pointed to a critical role for microRNAs in the pathogenesis and progression of EOC. In this review, we discuss the current data concerning the accumulating evidence of the modulated expression of microRNAs in EOC, their role in diagnosis, prognosis and prediction of response to therapy. Given the heterogeneity of this disease, it is likely that increases in long-term survival might be also achieved by translating the recent insights of miRNAs involvement in EOC into novel targeted therapies that will {{have a major impact on}} the management of ovarian cancer...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Paget's disease, {{described}} by Sir James Paget in 1874, {{is classified as}} mammary and extramammary. The mammary type is rare and often associated with intraductal cancer (93 - 100 % of cases). It is more prevalent in postmenopausal women and it appears as an eczematoid, erythematous, moist or crusted lesion, with or with-out fine scaling, infiltration and inversion of the nipple. It must be distinguished from erosive adenomatosis of the nipple, cutaneous extension of breast carcinoma, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, chronic eczema, lactiferous ducts ectasia, Bowen's disease, basal cell carcinoma, melanoma and intraductal papilloma. Diagnosis is <b>histological</b> and <b>prognosis</b> and treatment depend {{on the type of}} underlying breast cancer. Extramammary Paget's disease is considered an adenocarcinoma originating from the skin or skin appendages in areas with apocrine glands. The primary location is the vulvar area, followed by the perianal region, scrotum, penis and axillae. It starts as an erythematous plaque of indolent growth, with well-defined edges, fine scaling, excoriations, exulcerations and lichenification. In most cases it is not associated with cancer, although there are publications linking it to tumors of the vulva, vagina, cervix and corpus uteri, bladder, ovary, gallbladder, liver, breast, colon and rectum. Differential diagnoses are candidiasis, psoriasis and chronic lichen simplex. Histopathology confirms the diagnosis. Before treatment begins, associated malignancies should be investigated...|$|R

A correlation between <b>histological</b> grading and <b>prognosis</b> was not detected, as both cases showed local recurrences within one year after surgery although they were, respectively, of epithelioid and undifferentiated type. While surgery appears to be the choice treatment of the primary lesion, the treatment of cervical metastasis is still disputable.

40|$|Objective. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the prognostic significance of serosal involvement (SER), adnexal involvement (ADN), and positive peritoneal washings (PPW) in patients with Stage IIIA uterine cancer. We also sought to determine patterns of recurrence in patients with this disease. Methods. The records of 136 patients with Stage IIIA uterine cancer treated at the Queensland Centre for Gynecological Cancer between March 1983 and August 2001 were reviewed. One hundred thirty-six patients underwent surgery and 58 (42. 6 %) had full surgical staging. Seventy-five patients (55. 2 %) had external beam radiotherapy and/or brachytherapy postoperatively. Overall survival was the primary statistical endpoint. Statistical analysis included univariate and multivariate Cox models. Results. Forty-six patients (33. 8 %) had adnexal involvement, 23 (16. 9 %) had serosal involvement, and 40 (29. 4 %) had positive peritoneal washings. Median follow-up was 55. 1 months (95 % confidence interval, 36. 9 to 73. 4 months) after which time 71 patients (52. 2 %) remained alive. For patients with endometrioid adenocarcinoma, ADN and SER were associated with impaired survival on multivariate analysis (odds ratio 2. 8 and 3. 2, respectively). In the subgroup of patients with high-risk tumors (including papillary serous carcinomas, clear cell carcinomas, and uterine sarcomas), neither ADN, nor SER, nor PPW influenced survival. Conclusion. Patients with Stage IIIA uterine cancer constitute a heterogeneous group. For patients with endometrioid adenocarcinoma, both ADN and SER, but not PPW, were associated with impaired prognosis.

The value of ^ 1 H Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) performed on 5 scanners in the diagnosis and prognostication of an extensive bi-centre cohort of low-grade gliomas is investigated. Methods: Single voxel MRS was performed routinely in children with brain tumours at the Birmingham Children’s Hospital and Queen’s Medical Centre. Histopathological features were semi-quantified and in vitro ^ 1 H NMR used to study pilocytic astrocytoma cell lines. Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI) and texture analysis of MR images were performed.

MHC class I expression on tumor cells was evaluated using the avidin-biotin peroxidase complex method. Loss of MHC class I expression from canine mammary gland carcinomas was significantly correlated with poor prognosis (P< 0. 05). Loss of MHC class I expression showed no association with poor prognosis in canine mammary gland complex carcinomas, because the data were not balanced. Only 1 of 13 (7. 6 %) canine mammary gland complex carcinomas showed loss of MHC class I expression. All 13 of these dogs showed good prognosis.

40|$|Background: Early {{recurrence}} is a {{major problem}} after hepatic resection of colorectal hepatic metastasis (CHM). Our aim was to investigate the relationship between time to recurrence after CHM resection and overall survival. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed for 101 consecutive patients who underwent hepatic resection for CHM and have been followed more than 5 years. Results: Among 101 patients, 82 (81 %) had a recurrence. Overall survival of patients with recurrence within 6 months after CHM resection was significantly worse than that of patients with recurrence after more than 6 months (P < 0. 01). Overall survival was poorer when time to recurrence was shorter. One of the reasons for poor prognosis of patients with recurrence within 6 months was that only a few patients could undergo a second resection for recurrence after CHM resection. Histological type, including poorly differentiated signet ring cell or mucinous adenocarcinoma in the primary tumor, bilobar metastases, microscopic positive surgical margin and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) above 15 ng/ml had predictive value for decreased recurrence-free survival after CHM resection. Conclusion: Short time to recurrence after CHM resection correlates with a poor <b>prognosis.</b> <b>Histological</b> type of poorly differentiated signet ring cell or mucinous adenocarcinoma in the primary tumor might be a predictor for early recurrence after CHM resection.

40|$|Colorectal {{malignancies}} demonstrating {{microsatellite instability}} (MSI) {{have a very}} heterogeneous <b>histological</b> appearance, better <b>prognosis,</b> and altered response to therapy. Consequently, identification of the MSI phenotype is both relevant and interesting as a screening and prognostic tool and as a potential predictive factor of chemotherapeutic response. Several groups have argued for the exclusive use of mononucleotide markers for MSI analysis. In this study, an alternative MSI typing multiplex system of mononucleotide microsatellite repeats was developed. This system obviates the need to compare allelic profiles between tumor and matching normal DNA, rendering MSI analysis amenable to high throughput. The quasi-monomorphic allelic distribution of five alternative mononucleotide markers was evaluated in genomic DNA. Only SEC 63 and CAT 25 {{were found to be}} quasi-monomorphic and were thus combined with BAT 25 and BAT 26 from the Bethesda panel. Consequently, 177 colorectal cancer samples previously analyzed by the Bethesda panel were tested for MSI using this alternative mononucleotide panel. In an attempt to resolve discordant cases, immunohistochemistry of MLH 1, MSH 2, and MSH 6 was performed. The concordance between both panels reached 99. 4 % when microsatellite stability and MSI-L were grouped together.

40|$|Squamous cell carcinomas are {{the most}} {{commonly}} diagnosed oral malignancy, accounting for about 90 % of all malignant oral lesions. Detection of the condition at early stages is rare; as a result, the clinical and <b>histological</b> characteristics and <b>prognosis</b> of this tumor have not been extensively investigated. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate clinical and microscopic features of squamous cell carcinomas using immunohistochemical analysis and assessing biological markers of angiogenesis and tumor vascular activity (anti-CD 31, anti-CD 34, Factor VIII), cell proliferation (Ki- 67), and loss of cell suppression (p 53). Tolonium chloride 1 % was used to determine the optimal biopsy site. Six patients seen at the Stomatology Service of a university hospital in Canoas, southern Brazil, with a suspected diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma were analyzed. All patients were male, with a mean age of 56. 6 years, and four had a white skin color. Lesions were detected in the tongue (4) and tonsillar pillar (2). All diagnoses were confi rmed by microscopy (hematoxylin-eosin staining). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed p 53 expression in 5 of the cases, Ki- 67 in 6, and anti-CD 34 in 1; anti-CD 31 and Factor VIII were not detected in any patient. Our fi ndings suggest an important contribution of tumor markers in the diagnosis and prognosis of these malignancies, as well as in treatment planning...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Neoplasms {{involving}} the optic nerve are rare. Intraorbital meningiomas, {{the most common}} tumour of the optic nerve, represent only 3 % of all meningiomas in dogs, so few data exists to predict its symptoms and biologic behaviour. Objectives The authors describe and submit for discussion, a rare case of retrobulbar meningioma, in particular for assessment of <b>histological</b> grade and <b>prognosis.</b> Medical History A 10 year old Labrador Retriever male dog was presented for complaints of swelling and purulent discharge of the right eye. The animal had exophthalmos, protrusion of the third eyelid, chemosis, deep corneal ulceration and no pupillary light reflex. Exophthalmos due to a retrobulbar mass was diagnosed after physical, ophthalmic and ultrasound examination. Material and Methods The sample was fixed in 10 % buffered formalin solution, processed for routine histopathological diagnosis and a standard Streptavidin-Biotin Complex technique for immunohistochemical evaluation was also performed. Results Macroscopic examination revealed a conic mass, located in the retrobulbar portion of the optic nerve, adjacent to the posterior aspect of the globe with homogeneous, lobulated and whitish appearance and firm consistency. Microscopic examination revealed spindloid cells, with round-to-oval, finely stippled nuclei, small or indistinct nucleoli, moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm, arranged in concentric whorls around capillaries, separated by interlacing fascicles, with small amount of well vascularized, collagenous stroma. Conclusion The authors suggested the diagnosis of transitional meningioma, based on the histopathological diagnosis and immunohistochemistry results.

40|$|Introduction Sarcomas, {{particularly}} vascular tumours, can mimic other neoplastic {{conditions or}} even inflammatory diseases. Objectives The authors describe an unusual case of vascular tumour, histologically overlapping with benign lymphangioma and liposarcoma. Medical History A 8 year old Shar Pei male dog {{was presented with}} a subcutaneous nodule in the chest, measuring 3 x 2 cm. Material and Methods The sample was fixed in 10 % buffered formalin solution and processed for routine histopathological diagnosis with Haematoxylin and Eosin. A standard Streptavidin-Biotin Complex technique for immunohistochemical evaluation was also performed, using a Polyclonal Rabbit Anti-Human Von Willebrand Factor. Results Macroscopic examination revealed a well circumscribed nodule with homogeneous and brownish appearance and moderate consistency on a cut surface. Microscopic examination revealed clefts and variably-sized vascular spaces, lined by a single layer of spindle cells, with round-to-oval nuclei, small or indistinct nucleoli, small amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm, with endothelial appearance – areas like hemangiosarcoma, interspersed with areas, where these cells appeared to grow directly on thick bundles of dermal collagen, occasionally with erythrocytes – areas like lymphangioma. The stroma was also interspersed with vacuolar cells – areas like liposarcoma. No mitotic figures were seen, however, the presence of very rich cellular areas, with more prominent cells revealing pleomorphism and anisocariosis, were more favour to malignancy Conclusion The authors suggested the diagnosis of vascular neoplasia with unusual features, based on the histopathological diagnosis and immunohistochemistry results, and submit to the discussion, especially for assessment of <b>histological</b> grade and <b>prognosis...</b>|$|R
40|$|AIDS related {{mortality}} {{has fallen}} sharply in industrialised countries since 1996 following {{the introduction of}} highly active antiretroviral therapy. This {{has been accompanied by}} an increase in the proportion of deaths attributable to non‐AIDS defining solid tumours, especially lung cancer. The risk of developing lung cancer seems to be higher in HIV infected subjects than in the general population of the same age, partly because the former tend more frequently to be smokers and, especially, intravenous drug users. The carcinogenic role of the antiretroviral nucleoside drugs and their interaction with smoking needs to be examined. Interestingly, there is no clear relationship between the degree of immunosuppression and the risk of lung cancer, so the reason for the increased risk is unknown. The mean age of HIV infected patients at the time of lung cancer diagnosis is 45  years and most are symptomatic. Lung cancer is diagnosed when locally advanced or metastatic (stage III–IV) in 75 – 90 % of cases, similar to patients with unknown HIV status. Adenocarcinoma is the most frequent <b>histological</b> type. The <b>prognosis</b> is worse in HIV infected patients than in the general lung cancer population. Efficacy and toxicity data for chemotherapy and radiation therapy are few and imprecise. Surgery remains the treatment of choice for localised disease in patients with adequate pulmonary function and general good health, regardless of immune status. Prospective clinical trials are needed to define the optimal detection and treatment strategies for lung cancer in HIV infected patients...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} pathologic diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of 125 patients with nontransitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder. Materials and Methods: A total of 3590 patients with bladder tumors operated in our clinic between September 1998 and May 2013 were retrospectively evaluated. A total of 125 patients (107 men and 18 women) with nontransitional cell bladder cancer, confirmed by histopathology, were included in this study. The patients′ characteristics, including age, gender, smoking history, tumor size, and localization, histological types, pathological tumor stages, treatment modalities, and survival rates were all recorded. Results: Of these tumors, 47 (37. 6 %) were adenocarcinoma (AC), 42 (33. 6 %) were squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), 23 (18. 4 %) were undifferentiated carcinoma (UC), 13 (10. 4 %) were other types of bladder carcinoma. Sixty-three (50. 4 %) patients had undergone radical cystectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy ± adjuvant treatment (chemotherapy [CT]/radiotherapy) and 52 (41. 6 %) patients received radiotherapy ± CT. The median survival time of patients with AC and SCC {{were significantly higher than}} patients with UC (AC vs UC, P = 0. 001; SCC vs UC, P = 0. 000; AC vs. SCC, P = 0. 219). Median survival time was significantly higher in radical cystectomy ± adjuvant treatment group (P < 0. 05) in all <b>histological</b> types. Conclusion: <b>Prognosis</b> of urinary bladder tumors was directly related to histological type and stage of the tumor. CT or radiotherapy has limited response rates. Early radical cystectomy should be performed to improve prognosis...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Laparoscopic {{surgery is}} the gold {{standard}} for benign ovarian tumors because of its overall improved quality of life (QOL). However, some tumors diagnosed preoperatively as benign may be proven to be malignant by postoperative studies. The standard approach for the removal of a malignant ovarian tumor in our hospital is via laparotomy; however, there is no referential prognostic data on malignancies that are excised laparoscopically. To evaluate clinical and <b>histological</b> factors and <b>prognosis,</b> this study retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent surgery in our hospital, based on a preoperative diagnosis of benignancy, but later postoperative testing proved their tumors to be borderline or malignant. Participants and methods: The study group comprised 1322 women who underwent a laparoscopic procedure in our hospital {{on the basis of a}} preoperative diagnosis of a benign ovarian tumor. The procedures were performed between 1995 and 2011. The rate of borderline and malignant cases, histology, and postoperative treatment were investigated. Results: Of the 1322 patients, 15 (1. 1 %) patients were postoperatively diagnosed as having a borderline malignancy with various histological types and all of these patients had a good prognosis; four (0. 3 %) patients were postoperatively diagnosed as having a malignant tumor with various histological types; of these patients, two patients required emergency surgery. All four patients underwent additional surgery and chemotherapy with no recurrence to date. Conclusion: Some tumors diagnosed preoperatively as benign proved postoperatively to be malignant. Appropriate postoperative treatment effectively improved the prognosis. Particular attention should be paid to a possible occult malignancy that may manifest postoperatively, especially in patients who underwent emergency surgery. We recommend preoperative magnetic resonance imaging, even for emergency cases, to improve preoperative diagnosis...|$|R
