Hood Community College (MHCC) had called and left a message. I had an ominous feeling after listening to the seri-ous tone of the message asking me to call back as soon as possible. My colleague Anna, who was also attending the conference, got the same message. We found a quiet corner in the cavernous convention center and called back. We were informed that all three full-time librarians (the two of us along with our other colleague Julia, who was out of the country at the time) were all being laid off effective June 30, 2011. I was tenured, had worked at MHCC for eleven years at that point, and had faculty status. In fact, all three full-time librarians had tenure and all had faculty status...|$|R
