60|$|Here biology {{next steps}} in, with its splendid {{explanation}} of organic life, as due essentially to the secondary action of radiated solar energy {{on the outer}} crust of such a cooling and evolving planet. Falling on {{the cells of the}} simplest green plants, the potent sunlight dissociates the carbon from the oxygen in the carbonic acid floating in the atmosphere, and builds it up with the hydrogen of water in the tissues of the organism into starches and other organic products, which differ from the <b>inert</b> <b>substances</b> around them, mainly by the possession of locked-up solar energy. On the energy-yielding food-stuffs thus stored up the animal in turn feeds and battens, reducing what was before potential into actual motion, just as the steam-engine reduces the latent solar energy of coal into visible heat and visible movement in its furnace and its machinery. How the first organism came to exist biology has not yet been able fully to explain for us; but aided by chemical science it has been able to show us in part how some of the simpler organic bodies may have been originally built up, and it does not despair of showing us in the end how the earliest organism may actually have been produced from the prime elements of oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon. Into this most fundamental of biological problems, however, Darwin himself, with his constitutional caution and dread of speculative theorising, was not careful or curious to enter. Even upon the far less abstruse and hypothetical question, whether all life took its prime origin from a single starting-point or from several distinct and separate tribal ancestors, he hardly cared so much as to hazard a passing speculation. With splendid self-restraint he confined his attention almost entirely to the more manageable and practical problem of the origin of species by natural selection, which lay then and there open for solution before him. Taking for granted the existence of the original organism or group of organisms, the fact of reproduction, and the tendency of such reproduction to beget increase in a geometrical ratio, he deduced from these elementary given factors the necessary corollary of survival of the fittest, with all its marvellous and far-reaching implications of adaptation to the environment and specific distinctions. By doing so, he rendered conceivable the mechanism of evolution in the organic world, thus bringing another great aspect of external nature within the range of the developmental as opposed to the miraculous philosophy of the cosmos.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Under the {{conditions}} of the presence of surfactants and ultrasonication, the use of different cerium salt, respectively, with oxalic acid under solid state chemistry reactions, the synthesis of nano-rare earth metal complexes of cerium oxalate crystals was formed. The solid phase was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron diffraction (ED). The particle size, its distribution, and morphology of the prepared nanocrystallite were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results show that particle sizes are relatively uniform, the morphology of the crystal is spherical, the average particle diameter is about 40 nm, and the yield rate is approximately 91. 6 %. Furthermore, during the synthesis, the solid-state reaction conditions including raw materials, matching proportion of reactants, additions of <b>inert</b> <b>substance,</b> addition of trace solvents, surfactants and porphyrization time, etc, all have some influence on the morphology, particle size and size distribution of the final products. During the synthesis of the cerium oxalate nanocrystallines, the solid state reaction conditions such as changing reactant, matching proportion of reactant, adding <b>inert</b> <b>substance,</b> joining a little solvent or surface active solvent and grinding at different times may influence morphology, particle size and the size distribution of final products...|$|R

A nocebo effect occurs when the recipient of an <b>inert</b> <b>substance</b> reports a negative effect and/or a worsening of symptoms, with the outcome resulting not from the substance itself, but from negative expectations about the treatment.|$|R

In addition, two popular options are high-density porous polyethylene, marketed as Medpor, and ePTFE (expanded polytetrafluoroethylene), better known as Gore-Tex. Both Medpor and ePTFE are <b>inert</b> <b>substances,</b> providing better integration with the underlying tissue and bone than solid silicone. However, in the case of Medpor, the implants' integration and ingrowth with the underlying tissue causes difficulty removing the implant if revisions are needed.|$|E

50|$|Strong metal-support {{interaction}} is another case highlighting the oversimplification that heterogeneous catalysts are merely supported on an <b>inert</b> <b>substance.</b> The original evidence {{was provided by}} the finding that particles of platinum bind H2 with the stoichiometry PtH2 for each surface atom regardless of whether the platinum is supported or not. When, however, supported on titanium dioxide, Pt no longer binds with H2 with the same stoichiometry. This difference is attributed to the electronic influence of the titania on the platinum, otherwise called strong metal-support interaction.|$|R

5000|$|Chemical milling or {{industrial}} etching is the subtractive manufacturing process of using baths of temperature-regulated etching chemicals to remove material {{to create an}} object with the desired shape.

The process essentially involves bathing the cutting areas in a corrosive chemical known as an etchant, which reacts with the material {{in the area to}} be cut and causes the solid material to be dissolved; <b>inert</b> <b>substances</b> known as maskants are used to protect specific areas of the material as resists.|$|E
5000|$|Epithelioid {{cells are}} an {{essential}} characteristic of granulomas: {{that is to}} say that without them a histological finding is not a granuloma.

[...] The latter definition would include mere collections of giant cells surrounding <b>inert</b> <b>substances</b> like suture material - the so-called [...] "non-immune granulomas."Granuloma formation is a strategy that has evolved to deal with those pathogens that have learned to evade the host immune system by various means like resisting phagocytosis and killing within the macrophages. Granulomas try to wall off these organisms and prevent their further growth and spread. Many old scourges of mankind like tuberculosis, leprosy and syphilis fall into this category of diseases. Granuloma formation is also the feature of many of our newer problems like fungal infections, sarcoidosis and Crohn's diseases.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the concept and}} reports current test results of the “Digital microPropulsion” concept. A new micro-thruster configuration has been fabricated and tested, and a flight-test module has been constructed and tested. Initial space-flight tests of the micro-thrusters are planned for March, 2000. Propulsion, station-keeping, and attitude control for 1 kg micro-spacecraft will require a compact and light-weight integrated system for controllably generating tiny amounts of impulse. To accomplish these goals, we adopted a novel approach to micro-propulsion that avoids tanks, fuel lines, and valves. In this concept, an array of small sealed plenums are constructed each with a rupturable diaphragm on one side. The plenums are loaded with a fuel or an <b>inert</b> <b>substance</b> in gas, liquid or solid form. In {{the case of a}} fuel, it is ignited and reacts to typically form a high-pressure, high-temperature fluid. In the case of an <b>inert</b> <b>substance,</b> it is heated to raise its pressure. Once the pressure exceeds the burst pressure of the diaphragm, the diaphragm ruptures, and an impulse is imparted as the fluid is expelled from the plenum. Thus, each plenum can deliver one “bit ” of impulse. The size of the impulse is determined during fabrication {{by the size of the}} plenum and the fuel that is loaded into it. This approach eliminates valves (and valve leakage). It substitutes one-shot (and therefore consumable) individual thrusters fo...|$|R
