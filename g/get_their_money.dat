Production company Fu Works settled the case and promised to pay the creditors.|$|E
25|$|As {{during the}} Restoration, {{economics}} drove {{the stage in}} the Augustan period. Under Charles II court patronage meant economic success and so the Restoration stage featured plays that would suit the monarch and/or court. The drama that celebrated kings and told the history of Britain's monarchs was fit fare for the crown and courtiers. Charles II was a philanderer and so Restoration comedy featured a highly sexualized set of plays. However, after the reign of William and Mary, the court and the crown stopped taking {{a great interest in}} the playhouse. Theatres had to <b>get</b> <b>their</b> <b>money</b> from the audience of city dwellers, and plays that reflected city anxieties and celebrated the lives of citizens drew and were staged (Munns 96–99).|$|E

On Meet the Press, Paul defended his bid for the earmarked funds saying he never voted for an earmark in his life. Russert said Paul's statement was like saying, [...] "you voted for it before you voted against it." [...] Congressman Paul responded,"I put them in because I represent people who are asking for some of their money back, ... I'm against the tax system, but I take all my tax credits. I want to <b>get</b> <b>their</b> <b>money</b> back for the people." ...|$|E

Theaters had to <b>get</b> <b>their</b> <b>money</b> from the audience of city dwellers, therefore, and consequently plays that reflected city anxieties and celebrated the lives of citizens were the ones to draw crowds. The aristocratic material from the Restoration continued to be mounted, and adaptations of Tudor plays were made and ran, but the new plays that were authored and staged were the domestic- and middle-class dramas. The other dramatic innovation was [...] "spectacle": plays that had little or no text, but which emphasized novel special effects.|$|E

2500|$|The Soviet Union's {{last year}} of {{economic}} growth was 1989, and throughout the 1990s, recession ensued in the Former Soviet Republics. [...] In May 1998, following the 1997 crash of the East Asian economy, things began to get even worse in Russia. [...] In August 1998, {{the value of the}} ruble fell 34% and people clamored to <b>get</b> <b>their</b> <b>money</b> out of banks (see 1998 Russian financial crisis). [...] The government acted by dragging its feet on privatization programs. [...] Russians responded to this situation with approval by electing the more pro-dirigist and less liberal Vladimir Putin as President in 2000. [...] Putin proceeded to reassert the role of the federal government, and gave it power it had not seen since the Soviet era. [...] State-run businesses were used to out-compete some of the more wealthy rivals of Putin. [...] Putin's policies were popular with the Russian people, gaining him re-election in 2004. At the same time, the export-oriented Russian economy enjoyed considerable influx of foreign currency thanks to rising worldwide oil prices (from $15 per barrel in early 1999 to an average of $30 per barrel during Putin's first term). The early 2000s recession was avoided in Russia due to rebound in exports and, to some degree, a return to dirigisme.|$|E
