40|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that the premotion silent period (P. S. P.) appeared just before a rapid voluntary movement. This phenomenon {{is believed to be}} caused by one of the inhibitory discharge from the central nervous system. On the other hand, the silent period is also observed when muscles are relaxed by counter movement. This is called as counter movement silent period (C. S. P.). This present study was designed to investigate how both silent periods (P. S. P. and C. S. P.) were affected by adding relative load of 0 %, 15 % and 30 % of the subject's body weight. These loads were fixed to the waist belt of the subject. Eight healthy males aged 18 - 24 years were subjected to a series of experiment. They were asked to maintain the posture of standing with flexed knee joint at about 50 degrees on the force plate. In the first condition, they were requested to extend their knee joint responding to a <b>flashing</b> <b>lamp</b> as quickly as possible (Non-counter movement). In the secound condition, they were asked to extend knee joint as quickly as possible with couter movement to a <b>flashing</b> <b>lamp.</b> The EMG activities of M. rectus femoris, M. vastus medialis, M. vastus lateralis and M. biceps femoris were recorded using bipolar surface electorodes. Force curve from a force plate and electorogoniogram were recorded simultaneously. When the relative loads of body weight were increased from 0 % to 30 %, the following facts were observed. 1) Decrease in the rate of appearance in both silent periods. 2) No changes of the latency and the duration of both silent periods. 3) Prolonged movement time of both silent periods. 4) No change of the muscular of both silent periods. It was suggested in the present experiment that the increase of relative load of body weight would affect minus to the switching mechanism which is desirable to the fast muscular contraction in knee extensors. 本研究は、被検者体重の 0 ％・ 15 ％・ 30 ％負荷を付加した条件下で光刺激に対して垂直方向へ跳躍する反応動作を行わせ、動作前silent periodと意図的な脱力によって出現するsilent periodの筋収縮の切り換え機構が荷重負荷による準備姿勢時筋緊張の変化にともなって、どのように影響されるかを比較検討した。本実験結果は次のようである。　 1) 非反動動作のsp出現率は、外側広筋・内側広筋とも荷重負荷の増加にともなって減少し、特に外側広筋の 30 ％負荷では 0 ％と 15 ％負荷に比較して有意に減少した。反動動作のsp出現率は、外側広筋・内側広筋とも 0 ％負荷がもっとも高い値を示したが、負荷条件間には有意な差が認められなかった。　 2) 非反動動作と反動動作のsp出現潜時は、外側広筋・内側広筋とも荷重負荷の増大にともなって遅延する傾向を示したが、負荷条件間には有意な差が認められなかった。　 3) 非反動動作と反動動作のsp持続時間は、外側広筋・内側広筋とも荷重負荷に関係なくほぼ一定の値を示し、負荷条件間には有意な差が認められなかった。　 4) 非反動動作と反動動作の動作時間は、荷重負荷の増大にともなって延長し、特に反動動作では、 0 ％と 15 ％負荷に 5 ％水準、 0 ％と 30 ％負荷に 1 ％水準の有意な差が認められた。　 5) 非反動動作と反動動作の発揮筋力は、力積・平均発揮筋力・筋力上昇率のいずれの指標とも荷重負荷に関係なくほぼ一定の値を示し、負荷条件間には有意な差が認められなかった。　本実験における荷重負荷の増大にともなう筋収縮の切り換えは、神経系機能のsp出現潜時とその持続時間には影響を持たないが、tonic dischargeからphasic dischargeへの円滑な切り換え機構であるsp出現率を低下させ、また筋系機能においては発揮筋力には影響をもたないものの動作時間を延長させる作用のあることが示唆された...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} abserved that the premotion silent period (p. s. p.) appears {{just before a}} rapid {{voluntary}} movement. The present {{study was designed to}} investigate the effect of physical characteristics on the appearance of p. s. p. Subjects were healthy 77 males and 59 females aged 16 - 18 years. Body height, weight, skinfold thickness, isometric leg strength and reaction movement were measured on each subject. On the measurement of reaction movement, they were asked to maintain the standing posture with knee joint flexed at about 50 degrees on the force plate and to extend their knee joint responding to a <b>flashing</b> <b>lamp</b> as quickly as possible. The EMG activities of M. vastus lateralis, M. vastus medialis and M. biceps femoris were recorded using bipolar surface electrodes. Vertical force curve was recorded when the subjects extended the knee joint on a force plate. The following results were obtained from this experiment. 1) Positive significant correlation was found between the rate of appearance in p. s. p. and the rate of tension rise, and the peak force during the reaction movement. 2) Negative significant correlation was found between the latency of p. s. p. and the body fat mass, and the correlation between the latency of p. s. p. and the leg strength was positively significant. 3) No significant correlation was found between the duration of p. s. p. and physical characteristics. 4) The correlation between the movement time and body fat mass was positively significant. 5) Positive significant correlation was found between the peak value of force curve and the leg strength, and the correlation between the peak value of force curve and the percent of body fat was negatively significant. 6) Positive significant correlation was found between the rate of tension rise and the leg strength, and the correlation between the rate of tension rise and the percent of body fat mass negatively significant. It is suggested from these results that increasing the body fat mass delayed the latency of p. s. p. and movement time, and that increasing the leg strength shortened the movement time, rised the peak value of force curve and increased the rate of tension rise. On the other hand, the rate of appearance in p. s. p. might be effected by dynamic leg strength during reaction movement. 本研究は、 16 - 18 歳の健常な男子 77 名・女子 59 名を対象として、光刺激に対して垂直方向へ跳躍する反応動作を用い、持続性筋収縮から相動性筋収縮への切り換え時に出現する動作前silent periodと被検者の身体特性との間にどの様な関係にあるかを究明することをその目的とし、次のような結果を得た。　 1) 反応動作における動作前silent periodの出現率・出現潜時・持続時間は、男女間に有意な差が認められなかった。しかし、動作時間では、男子が女子に比較して有意に短縮し、力曲線の最大値と筋力上昇率では、男子が女子に比較して有意に大きい値を示した。　 2) 動作前silent period出現率と皮下脂肪厚・体脂肪率・脚伸展力・体重当たりの脚伸展力との間に有意な相関関係は認められなかったが、反応動作時における筋力上昇率と力曲線の最大値との間には有意な正の相関関係が認められた。　 3) 動作前silent period出現潜時と皮下脂肪厚・体脂肪率との間に有意な正の相関関係が認められ、脚伸展力と体重当たりの脚伸展力との間に有意な負の相関関係が認められた。　 4) 動作前silent periodの持続時間と皮下脂肪厚・体脂肪率・脚伸展力・体重当たりの脚伸展力との間に有意な相関関係は認められなかった。　 5) 動作時間と皮下脂肪厚・体脂肪率との間に有意な正の相関関係が認められた。　 6) 力曲線の最大値と体脂肪率との間に有意な負の相関関係が認められ、脚伸展力・体重当たりの脚伸展力との間には有意な正の相関関係が認められた。　 7) 筋力上昇率と体脂肪率との間に有意な負の相関関係が認められ、脚伸展力・体重当たりの脚伸展力との間には有意な正の相関関係が認められた。　以上の結果から、体脂肪量の増大は、動作前silent period出現潜時と動作時間の延長および力曲線の最大値と筋力上昇率の低下をまねき、脚筋力の増大は、動作時間の短縮および力曲線の最大値と筋力上昇率の増加作用のあることが示唆された。さらに、動作前silent periodの出現率は、反応動作時における筋力上昇率と力曲線の最大値が大きい被検者ほど高くなり、静的な筋力よりむしろ動的筋力が関与することが明らかにされた...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that the premotion silent period (psp) appears just before a rapid voluntary movement. The present {{study was designed to}} investigate the developmental changes in appearance of psp observed during reaction movement of the whole body. Subjects were 143 healthy males and 125 healthy females aged 5 - 18 years, and their physique (body height, body weight, skinfold thickness) and the reaction movement of the whole body were measured. On the measurement of the reaction movement, they were asked to maintain a standing posture with knee joint flexed at about 50 degrees on the force plate and to extend their knee joint responding to a <b>flashing</b> <b>lamp</b> as quickly as possible. The EMG activities of m. vastus medialis and m. biceps femoris were recorded by using bipolar surface electrodes and vertical force curve was simultaneously measured by using a force plate. The rate of appearance in psp increased with age in both sexes. The latency of psp shortened abruptly with age by 12 years in both sexes. The duration of psp shortened with age in both sexes. Using the age 18 figures as a base measurement, the relative values at age 5 were calculated. Rate of appearance in psp was about 50 %, latency of psp was about 300 %, and duration of psp was about 150 %. These results suggested that nervous switching mechanism developed similarly with age in both sexes but the development of the latency of psp was more immature than the rate of appearance in psp or the duration of psp. The movement time shortened abruptly with age by 12 years in both sexes. The vertical peak force and the rate of tension rise increased with age in males, but didn't increase from 12 to 18 years in females. Relative values of the movement time at 12 years based on 18 year old males was about 100 %, the vertical peak force was about 76 % and the rate of tension rise was about 75 %. These results suggested that the developmental process of muscular output system was different from the development of agility ability purposed quick movement system, and the former was more immature than the latter. 本研究は、 5 - 18 歳の健常な男子 143 名、女子 125 名を対象として、全身反応動作時に出現する内側広筋の動作前抑制現象およびこの時に発揮された床反力の加齢的変化について横断的に観察し、次のような結果を得た。PSP出現率は、男女とも加齢に伴って有意な増加を示した。PSP出現潜時は、男女とも 5 歳から 12 歳まで急激に短縮し、その後は緩慢な短縮となり、男女とも有意な短縮を示した。PSP持続時間は、男女とも加齢に伴って有意な短縮を示した。 18 歳を基準とした 5 歳のPSP出現率の相対値は約 50 ％、PSP出現潜時は約 300 ％、PSP持続時間は約 150 ％であった。これらの結果は、主動筋の動作前抑制機構が男女とも加齢にともなって発達し、PSP出現潜時の発達がPSP出現率やPSP持続時間に比較して極めて未熟であることを示唆している。動作時間は、男女とも加齢に伴って 5 歳から 12 ・ 13 歳にかけて急激に短縮し、その後は緩慢な変化となり、男女とも有意な短縮を示した。最大垂直分力と床反力上昇率は、男子では加齢に伴って増加し、女子では 12 歳以後は緩慢な変化となったが、男女とも有意な増加を示した。最大垂直分力と床反力上昇率の男女比較では、最大垂直分力が 15 歳以降、床反力上昇率が 13 歳以降に有意な差が認められた。 18 歳を基準とした 12 歳男子の動作時間の相対値は 100 ％、最大垂直分力が 76 ％、床反力上昇率が 75 ％であった。これらの結果は、全身反応動作における素早い動作を完了させることを目的とした動作が同時に発揮される床反力に比較して早期に発達を終了することを示唆している。なお、神経系については男女とも極めて類似した発達過程を示すが、筋出力系については 13 歳以降に男女で異なる発達過程を示すことが認められた...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate sex difference in the rate of appearance in premotion silent period (p. s. p.) which appears just before a rapid voluntary movement. Sixty-six healthy males and females ages 18 - 25 years were subjected to a series of experiment. Subjects were asked to exert muscle strength at 15 to 20 % of their maximum elbow extension strength for two to five seconds. Then they were requested to extend their elbow joint responding to a <b>flashing</b> <b>lamp</b> as quickly as possible. The EMG activities of triceps brachii and biceps brachii were recorded by bipolar surface electrodes. The three conditions of "complete p. s. p. ", "incomplete p. s. p.

The force curve of elbow extension was simultaneously recorded using a resistance strain gauge transducer, and the mechanogram was analyzed on the following items: A) The time from the signal to the onset of force curve (premotor time), B) The time from the onset to the peak of force curve (motor time) The followlng results were obtained: 1) The mean values of the rate of appearancein complete p. s. p. were 37 ･ 7 % in male and 31. 7 % in female on the right elbow extension, and 32. 4 % and 28 ･ 0 % on the left elbow extension, respectively. No significant sex difference was found. 2) The mean values of the rate of appearance in total p. s. p. (complete p. s. p. + incomplete p. s. p.) were 57. 4 % in male and 51 ･ 8 % in female on the right elbow extension, and 52. 3 % and 51. 2 % on the left elbow extension, respectively. No significant sex difference was found. 3) The mean values of the premotor time were 199 msecin male and 200 msec in female on the right elbow extension, and 203 msec and 208 msec on the left elbow extension, respectively. No significant sex difference was found. 4) The mean values of the motor time were lO 7 msec in male and 125 msec in female on the right elbow extension, and 110 msec and 134 msec on the left elbow extension, respectively. Significant sex difference was found at a level of 1 % on each elbow extension. The fact that no sex difference was observed on the rate of appearance in premotion silent period and on the premotor time would suggest that there are no sex difference on such a function of the nervous system. 主動筋に軽度の随意的な緊張を与えた状態から急速に反応動作をおこすと、動作に先行して主動筋に Silent period が出現する。本実験は、肘関節伸展動作を用いて、この動作前 silent period 出現率および動作開始時間･動作時間における男女差の有無を究明しようとした。被検者は、健常な 18 ～ 25 オまでの男女大学生、各々 33 名、合計 66 名である。本実験結果は、次のようである。 1) P.

However, a major drawback of <b>flash</b> <b>lamps</b> is the plasma glow that persists for tens of microseconds after the primary discharge. When a <b>flash</b> <b>lamp</b> produces a pulse, a tail remains causing unwanted further excitation to the initial pulse of the phosphor in a time dependent manner.
