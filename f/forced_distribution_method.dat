The first research on quadruped robots focused on static walking, where {{the center of the}} gravity (COG) is always in the supporting leg polygon [1]. Hirose et al. [2] built a series of quadruped robots (TITAN) that could stably climb up a set of stairs. A stability criterion, the Normalized Energy Stability Margin, was proposed to evaluate the stability of walking [3]. A walking gait with a large stability margin was also proposed [4]. Estremera and Santos proposed a free gait, which allows the quadruped robot (SILO 4) to have a statically stable gait by searching for optimal footholds [5, 6].

In this context, control of contact forces is fundamental to ensure stable contacts and equilibrium of the robot. In this paper we propose a planning/control framework for quasi-static walking of quadrupedal robots, implemented for a demanding application in which regulation of ground reaction forces is crucial. Experimental results demonstrate that our 75 -kg quadruped robot is able to walk inside two high-slope (50 degrees) V-shaped walls; an achievement that to the authors' best knowledge has never been presented before. The robot distributes its weight among the stance legs so as to optimize user-defined criteria. We compute joint torques that result in no foot slippage, fulfillment of the unilateral constraints of the contact forces and minimization of the actuators effort.

30|$|Problems {{can often}} occur when a legged robot {{attempts}} {{to walk on}} irregular or damaged terrain, such as in search and rescue missions during natural and man-made disasters. In some cases, the ground beneath the robot will collapse because of the pressure of its weight, causing the machine to lose its foothold and topple over. This is a point to which we as designers must pay careful attention when designing a robot. Thus, in such irregular areas, the robot should walk carefully {{so as not to}} collapse its footholds. To attempt to solve this problem, we proposed the “leg-grope walk” method which allows a quadruped robot to avoid stumbling or causing a large collapse of the surrounding area on weak horizontal planes. Specifically, when the robot puts its foot on the ground, it applies some excess force on the ground and confirms whether the foothold is likely to collapse, so as to choose a foothold will not collapse. In this study, we extended this method to weak and irregular slopes, where slippage needs to be considered. A new walking method was designed using a <b>force</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>method.</b> To validate the method, we show simulation results from <b>force</b> <b>distribution</b> and robotic experiments in various environments. These results demonstrate that our method allows a robot to walk carefully without slipping or stumbling, even when its foothold is lost.|$|R

This is widely used to optimize the design of aircrafts and aircraft components. Additionally, the hydrodynamic properties of marine components like ship hulls or propulsion systems can be predicted.

Parallel wire robots were successfully used to perform airplane maneuvers in wind tunnels due to their good aerodynamical and mechanical properties. Compared to aircraft design, marine models are very heavy (up to 500 kg). Thus, the positioning system must be very stiff to avoid vibrations. Additionally, fast maneuvers require powerful drives.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{objective of this}} investigation {{is to develop a}} pushover analysis procedure based on structural dynamics theory, which retains the conceptual simplicity and computational attractiveness of current procedures with invariant <b>force</b> <b>distribution,</b> but provides superior accuracy in estimating seismic demands on buildings. The standard response spectrum analysis (RSA) for elastic buildings is reformulated as a Modal Pushover Analysis (MPA). The peak response of the elastic structure due to its nth vibration mode can be exactly determined by pushover analysis of the structure subjected to lateral forces distributed over the height of the building according to s*n = mφn, where m is the mass matrix and φn its nth-mode, and the structure is pushed to the roof displacement determined from the peak deformation Dnof the nth-mode elastic SDF system. Combining these peak modal responses by modal combination rule leads to the MPA procedure. The MPA procedure is extended to estimate the seismic demands for inelastic systems: First, a pushover analysis determines the peak response rno of the inelastic MDF system to individual modal terms, peff,n(t) = −snüg (t), in the modal expansion of the effective earthquake forces, peff,n (t) = −mιüg (t). The base shear-roof displacement (Vbn −um) curve is developed from a pushover analysis for force distributions*n. This pushover curve is idealized as bilinear and converted to the force-deformation relation for the nth-“mode” inelastic SDF system. The peak deformation of this SDF system is used to determine the roof displacement, at which the seismic response, rno, is determined by pushover analysis. Second, the total demand, ro, is determined by combining the rno (n= 1, 2,…) according to an appropriate modal combination rule. Comparing the peak inelastic response of a 9 -story SAC building determined by the approximate MPA procedure with rigorous nonlinear response history analysis (RHA) demonstrates that the approximate procedure provides good estimates of floor displacements and story drifts, and identifies locations of most plastic hinges; plastic hinge rotations are less accurate. The results presented for El Centro ground motion scaled by factors varying from 0. 25 to 3. 0, show that MPA estimates the response of buildings responding well into the inelastic range to a similar degree of accuracy when compared to standard RSA for estimating peak response of elastic systems. Thus the MPA procedure is accurate enough for practical application in building evaluation and design. Comparing the earthquake-induced demands for the selected 9 -story building determined by pushover analysis using three <b>force</b> <b>distributions</b> in FEMA- 273, MPA, and nonlinear RHA, it is demonstrated that the FEMA <b>force</b> <b>distributions</b> greatly underestimate the story drift demands, and the MPA procedure is more accurate than all the FEMA <b>force</b> <b>distributions</b> <b>methods</b> in estimating seismic demands. However, all pushover analysis procedures considered do not seem to compute to acceptable accuracy local response quantities, such as hinge plastic rotations. Thus the present trend of comparing computed hinge plastic rotations against rotation limits established in FEMA- 273 to judge structural performance does not seem prudent. Instead, structural performance evaluation should be based on story drifts known to be closely related to damage and can be estimated to a higher degree of accuracy by pushover analyses...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Because the {{collapse}} voltage determines the operating {{point of the}} capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT), {{it is crucial to}} calculate and control this parameter. One approach uses parallel plate approximation, where a parallel plate motion models the average membrane displacement. This usually yields calculated collapse voltage 25 percent higher than the actual collapse voltage. More accurate calculation involves finite element method (FEM) analysis. However, depending on the required accuracy, the computation time may require many hours. In this paper, we propose a fast numerical algorithm for the calculation of collapse voltage. The algorithm uses the parallel plate method to approximate the <b>force</b> <b>distribution</b> over the membrane, and then applies an analytical solution for the plate equation, loaded by the approximated <b>force</b> <b>distribution.</b> Using this <b>method,</b> we are able to calculate {{the collapse}} voltage in a couple of seconds, within 0. 1 percent accuracy. We report on the collapse voltage calculation results using our method for four different design structures.

In order to achieve improved vehicle stability and handling performance for electric vehicles with in-wheel steering and driving motors, the control of the vehicle body slip angle and yaw rate is actually an over-actuated control problem.

In addition, since the PI controllers for eight actuators (four steering actuators and four driving actuators) have a total of 16 control gains to be determined, a genetic algorithm is applied to accurately determine these control gains.
