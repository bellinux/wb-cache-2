5|$|The <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> birds should {{continue}} to be actively collected for research {{has been the subject of}} some debate among ornithologists (examples of this can be found in the lively exchanges between Remsen and Bekoff & Elzanowski, between Vuilleumier and Donegan, and between Dubois & Nemesio and Donegan).|$|E
5|$|A common {{criticism}} {{of the game is}} its short length. Episode One takes roughly 4–6 hours to complete, which raises the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> the game justifies its price. Computer Games Magazine argued the futility of reviewing the game due to its episodic nature; as the first part of a three-part story arc, it is difficult to judge it when divorced from the final product. Game Revolution expressed disappointment at a lack of new features such as environments and weapons.|$|E
5000|$|Application of the Bill of Rights {{concerns}} the <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> {{and how the}} Bill of Rights applies in a legal dispute. The first <b>of</b> these <b>issues</b> (<b>whether</b> the Bill <b>of</b> Rights applies) raises four questions: ...|$|R
50|$|Legal {{reform and}} {{review of the}} concern is ongoing and the {{convictions}} are controversial due to <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> a government or one's self is justified to control one's own body in private situations where the only harm is to consenting adults.|$|R
50|$|This {{does not}} present <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> the values are {{positive}} or negative, and the function's properties are much simpler to demonstrate (indeed, {{it can be}} differentiated without using first principles by considering the derivative at x = 0 of cx, where c is a constant, then generalising c).|$|R
5|$|Brown {{supports}} expanding solar, wind, {{and nuclear}} power, and offshore drilling exploration {{as a means}} to reduce the country's dependence on foreign oil. But, when faced with the controversial <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> an offshore wind farm should be allowed in the waters off the Cape Cod coast in Massachusetts, a major tourist destination and boating location, he expressed opposition, saying he believed it would hinder tourism and boating in the area.|$|E
5|$|The offensive, {{together}} with Operation Sana, caused controversy among military analysts regarding the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> NATO airstrikes or the two ground offensives contributed more towards {{the resolution of}} the Bosnian War, and to what extent ARBiH, HVO and HV advances were helped by, or conversely the VRS hampered by, NATO bombing. In 2011, five former Croatian military personnel were convicted of war crimes for the summary execution of five Bosnian Serb soldiers and an unknown civilian during the offensive.|$|E
5|$|Wulfred {{came into}} {{conflict}} with King Coenwulf of Mercia over the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> laymen could control religious houses, with the king supporting the rights of laymen to control monasteries. In 808 the papacy informed Charlemagne that Cenwulf had not yet made peace with the archbishop, but by 809 {{they seem to have}} been on good terms; the two were involved in a series of land transfers from 809 to 815.|$|E
50|$|The major {{subject matter}} of Rickshaw Boy {{is the way in}} which the hero makes his living pulling a rickshaw, the options he faces and choices he makes, and {{especially}} the fundamental <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> to work independently or as a servant to a family, and whether to rent or own a rickshaw.|$|R

It considers what worked in reducing domestic burglary and aims to explain the factors underlying this success. The <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> interventions were theoretically robust, and how intensively they needed to be implemented in practice to achieve any impact are examined...|$|R
5|$|Coenwulf {{came into}} {{conflict}} with Archbishop Wulfred of Canterbury over the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> laypeople could control religious houses such as monasteries. The breakdown {{in the relationship between}} the two eventually reached the point where the archbishop was unable to exercise his duties for at least four years. A partial resolution was reached in 822 with Coenwulf's successor, King Ceolwulf, but it was not until about 826 that a final settlement was reached between Wulfred and Coenwulf's daughter, Cwoenthryth, who had been the main beneficiary of Coenwulf's grants of religious property.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{the appeal}} did not engage foreign policy considerations. The treaty was a civil {{convention}} between two countries and {{an agreement to}} render mutual judicial assistance, and {{had nothing to do}} with foreign affairs other than that it was made between state parties. It also did not involve the policing of government conduct in international affairs, because it only implicated the procedures private litigants had to take to serve writs on defendants residing in Hong Kong. When interpreting the treaty, the Court only had to determine the domestic legal obligations of the respondents seeking to serve a writ out of jurisdiction. Thus, the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> the treaty applied to Hong Kong was justiciable, and the Ministry's letter was not decisive on the matter.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, Ettelson became locally {{famous for}} a debate {{he had at}} Nashville's Ellis Auditorium with Scopes Trial lawyer Clarence Darrow {{on whether or not}} {{religion}} was necessary. Ettelson argued in favor, Darrow against. Friction between Ettelson and some board members came to a head in 1937, when the board discussed the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> to retain him as rabbi; when invited to the meeting, he spoke briefly, then resigned. The board recommended that his tenure be put to a congregational vote at the next annual meeting, where he was re-elected in a secret ballot by a vote of 303 to 31. He took an eight-month medical leave in 1938, and Children of Israel hired Morton Cohn as assistant rabbi.|$|E
40|$|Neural crest {{cells are}} {{multipotent}} progenitor cells, {{but it is}} not understood how these cells generate their diverse differentiated progeny. This review considers the <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> neural crest cells self-renew, whether they generate partially committed intermediate progenitors, and how the local embryonic environment may act to control this diversification process. Novel molecular markers for neural crest cells are also discussed...|$|R
50|$|When Indiana {{was granted}} {{statehood}} in 1816, the constitution instituted {{a ban on}} slavery. This ban brought the previous laws that had permitted slavery into conflict, and the <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> preexisting slave arrangements were still legal was brought before the courts on several occasions. Each time the circuit courts had denied or approved {{the freedom of the}} slaves on an individual basis.|$|R

5|$|Nouakchott was a tiny, {{fortified}} {{fishing village}} (ksar) in pre-colonial times and under French rule. As Mauritania prepared for independence, it lacked a capital {{city and the}} area of present-day Nouakchott was chosen by Moktar Ould Daddah and his advisors. Ould Daddah desired for the new capital to be a symbol of modernity and national unity which ruled out existing cities or towns in the interior. The village {{was selected as the}} capital city for its central location between Saint-Louis, Senegal, the city from which the colony of Mauritania was governed, and Nouadhibou. Its location also meant that it avoided the sensitive <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> the capital was built in an area dominated by the Arab-descended Moors or Black Africans.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Appeal held {{further that}} as the {{discretion}} conferred by section 8 of the ISA involved national security, the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> detention was necessary should be left solely to executive discretion. However, the Court referred to two United Kingdom decisions which stood for the principle that courts are not precluded from determining whether a decision is in fact based on grounds of national security. Therefore, the court could still determine whether the matters relied on by the executive {{in the exercise of}} discretion were indeed within the scope of section 8.|$|E
5|$|The {{coalition}} Government {{which took}} office in March 2011 convened a Constitutional Convention to discuss proposed amendments to the Constitution of Ireland, including plans to introduce same-sex marriage. On 10 July 2012, the Dáil, referred the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> to make provision for same-sex marriage to the Constitutional Convention, to report back in a year. On 14 April 2013, the convention approved provisions allowing for same-sex marriage, to be discussed by the Oireachtas and be put to a public referendum. On 2 July 2013, the Constitutional Convention delivered the formal report to the Oireachtas, which had four months to respond.|$|E
40|$|The 2006 High Court {{decision}} {{in the case of}} Commissioner of Taxation v Citylink Melbourne Ltd (2006) 62 ATR 1282; [2006] HCA 35 concerns a much-litigated area <b>of</b> taxation law: <b>whether</b> expenses are revenue and thus deductible or capital and therefore not deductible.

50|$|State v. Mitchell, 170 Mo. 633, 71 S.W. 175 (1902), is a precedent-setting {{decision}} of the Supreme Court of Missouri {{which is part of}} the body of case law involving the prosecution of failed attempts to commit a crime. In United States law, cases involving failed criminal attempts can bring up interesting legal <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> the crime was unsuccessful due to factual impossibility or to legal impossibility.|$|R
50|$|Generally, a {{forensic}} psychologist is designated {{as an expert}} in a specific field of study. The number of areas of expertise in which {{a forensic}} psychologist qualifies as an expert increases with experience and reputation. Forensic neuropsychologists are generally asked to appear as expert witnesses in court to discuss cases that involve issues with the brain or brain damage. They may also deal with <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> a person is legally competent to stand trial.|$|R
5|$|The <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> the Act was constitutionally valid {{revolved}} around the fact that immigration detention {{is a form of}} administrative detention, or detention imposed by the executive branch of government. Detention generally {{is considered to be a}} judicial function, which can be exercised only by courts, pursuant to Chapter III of the Australian Constitution. However, there are certain exceptions which allow non-judicial detention, such as detention in order to effect an arrest, or detention for quarantine purposes. Courts in Australia have also held that, generally, detention of non-citizens for immigration purposes is also valid.|$|E
5|$|When Wilson {{proposed}} {{establishment of}} a League of Nations, with the League's charter part of the Treaty of Versailles, Taft expressed public support. He was {{out of step with}} his party, whose senators were not inclined to ratify the treaty. Taft's subsequent flip-flop on the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> reservations to the treaty were necessary angered both sides, destroying any remaining influence he had with the Wilson administration, and causing some Republicans to call him a Wilson supporter and a traitor to his party. The Senate refused to ratify the Versailles pact.|$|E
5|$|In his {{new role}} Nichols clashed with the AEC over the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> it or the Department of Defense should have custody of nuclear weapons. The administration's policy {{remained}} firmly in favor of AEC control. This was tested during the Berlin Blockade, when Truman ordered B-29 bombers to Europe. For a time {{there was talk of}} calling off the Operation Sandstone nuclear weapons tests, but Nichols successfully argued for their continuation. In 1950, he became Deputy Director of the Guided Missiles Division of the Department of Defense, overseeing the Nike Project. He was appointed Chief of Research and Development when it was reorganized in 1952. Nichols retired from the Army on 31 October 1953. For his services from 1948 to 1953, he was belatedly awarded a second Distinguished Service Medal in 1956.|$|E

40|$|In Hendrix the Tax Court {{considered}} the <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> defined value clauses {{were the result}} of arm’s-length transactions and whether they were void as against public policy. The underlying dispute was whether the taxpayers’ transfers of the John H. Hendrix Co. stock were valued at fair market value. With a decision favoring the taxpayers, the defined value clauses in both McCord and Hendrix impede the accurate valuation of taxable gifts to family members and of deductible charitable gifts...|$|R

5|$|In {{the weeks}} before the Gator Bowl, media and fan {{attention}} focused on Virginia Tech's possible disappointment at not being selected for a BCS game, the coaching situations at the two schools, and the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> or not Tech quarterback Michael Vick would return for another year of collegiate football. After the Virginia Tech-Clemson matchup was announced for the Gator Bowl, spread bettors favored Virginia Tech to win by 6.5 points. The betting line remained there throughout the month of December and until the game began. There were almost no off-field incidents involving players from either team: The only notable event involved two backup players from Clemson who were indicted for money counterfeiting and were suspended for the Gator Bowl. In exchange for appearing in the game, the teams were guaranteed to split a payout of $3,313,610.|$|E
5|$|There was {{uncertainty}} {{as to how}} {{to treat}} the wider battlefields surrounding these monuments. At the end of the war, visitors and tourists could easily see the damage caused by the war and the detritus of the fighting, but post-war reconstruction meant that by the 1930s most of this damage along the Western front had been restored. In several cases, veterans felt that the battlefields should be maintained in their immediate post-war condition as memorials; the reconstruction of the town of Ypres was opposed by some who favoured keeping the ruins as a memorial. It was proposed to leave the fortifications of Douaumont in ruins as a memorial to the dead of Verdun, and the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> or not to replant the region with trees in the 1930s proved controversial with veterans. Some parts of the trench systems were preserved intact as memorials, however, including the Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial and the trench system at the Canadian National Vimy Memorial. In other theatres, such as Iraq and Palestine, reconstruction took much longer and bodies remained unburied at least until 1929.|$|E
5|$|Under {{administrative}} law, {{judicial review}} {{is an exercise}} in which the High Court scrutinizes the executive's decisions and orders to ensure that they conform with the law. If the decisions and orders are not authorized by statute or if they have been made in contravention of administrative law principles, the Court can invalidate them. Similarly, if any exercise of power by an executive body contravenes the Constitution, the Court has a duty to declare it invalid. With regards to the ISA and the powers to detain without trial, the scope of judicial review was subject to a succession of changes between 1988 and 1990. These changes revolved around the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> the discretion of the President and the Home Affairs Minister should be assessed objectively or subjectively. During that period, the scope of judicial review was expanded by common law developments but was subsequently curtailed by legislative and constitutional amendments.|$|E
40|$|The <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> {{strategy}} {{selection in}} solving the Tower of Hanoi (TOH) problem is investigated {{by focusing on the}} critical <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> the selection process is contingent and adaptive. The results of an experiment in which participants solved a series of different four-disk TOH problems under instructions requiring accuracy maximization vs. effort minimization are presented. A computer simulation, comparing a number of known strategies to the experimental data, has been carried out to try to identify the strategies used by the participants. The findings support the hypothesis of adaptive and contingent strategy selection in the TOH domain...|$|R
