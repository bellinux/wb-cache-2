Microspheres prepared were found discrete, spherical and free flowing. The microsphere exhibits good drug entrapment efficiency. Naproxen sodium release from these microspheres was slow and extended and dependent {{on the type of}} polymer used. The data obtained thus suggest that mucoadhesive microspheres can successfully design for sustained delivery of Naproxen sodium and to improve patient compliance.

40|$|The use of hydrocolloids in {{different}} foods systems {{has become more}} commonly applied to improve the texture and quality of baked products. Nevertheless, {{the effects of these}} compounds on partially baked frozen chapatti have not been studied. The objective {{of the present study was}} to improve the storage stability, quality and shelf life of partially baked chapatti by adding various hydrocolloids, <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>propyl</b> methylcellulose (HPMC), carboxy methylcellulose (CMC) and guar gum, followed by frozen storage for 28 days. Partially baked and fully baked chapattis after frozen storage were analyzed for chemical and sensory attributes at 7 -day intervals. Rheological studies showed an increase in water absorption, dough development time and dough stability after the addition of hydrocolloids. In partially baked chapatti with hydrocolloids after frozen storage, an increase in moisture retention and water soluble starch was observed. Sensory characteristics were also improved by combining both techniques. Among the hydrocolloids, HPMC exhibited the best results, followed by CMC and guar gum. These hydrocolloids and partial baking with frozen storage helped to improve the quality, and extend the shelf life of partially baked chapatti...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} present {{investigation}} was to develop and optimize bucco mucoadhesive bilayered tablets of Propranolol hydrochloride (PrHCL) using the bioadhesive polymers <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>propyl</b> methyl cellulose (HPMC K 4 M), xanthan gum (XG) and acrypol 934 P (AL-P) individually and in combination along with ethyl cellulose (EC) as an impermeable backing layer. The 3 2 full factorial design was employed by selecting the independent variables as drug: polymer ratio (X 1) and influence of various diluents(X 2). Ex- vivo mucoadhesive strength (gm), t 50 - h and t 80 - h i. e. time required to release 50 % of the drug and 80 % of the drug respectively, similarity factor (f 2) and swelling index (%S. I) were selected as dependent variables. The tablets were prepared and were evaluated for weight variation, content uniformity, thickness, surface pH, swelling index, in-vitro drug release and ex- vivo mucoadhesion strength. The behaviors of formulations were examined during short time stability studies and {{were found to be}} stable.

40|$|The main aim of {{the study}} was to develop colon {{specific}} sustained release matrix tablets of diethyl carbamazine citrate (DEC), an anthelmintic for improving patient compliance, delivered to colon for its effective actions. The colon targeted matrix tablet was prepared by wet granulation technique using different percentage of guar gum as matrix carrier and coated with Eudragit L 100. Seven batches of matrix tablets were prepared with varying percentage of guar gum and <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>propyl</b> methyl cellulose (HPMC). The dissolution study of DEC matrix tablet in simulated colonic fluid (phosphate buffer pH 6. 8) was 96. 78 % at the end of 24 hr study. The best result of studies showed that colon targeted matrix tablet containing 48 % guar gum was most to provide targeting of DEC for local action in the colon. Short term stability studies (at 40 ± 2 ºC/ 75 ± 5 % RH for 3 months) on the best formulation indicated that there no significant changes in drug content. IR spectroscopic study indicated that there are no drug excipient interactions...|$|R
