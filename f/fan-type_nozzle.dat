40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{assessment}} of the potential application of plain waterjet for surface treatment of stone materials as an alternative to technologies traditionally employed for this task, like bush-hammering, sand-blasting and flaming. Waterjetting has been already proposed in the market for rough finishing of surfaces making use of a fast rotating head provided with multiple nozzles. At the University of Cagliari considerable research has already been carried out using either abrasive or plain waterjet, stationary or pulsed, generated through a <b>fan-type</b> <b>nozzle</b> aiming at obtaining an evenly treated surface. Aparticular goal of the tests described in the paper is that of developing a technique enabling to make engravings on the stone in order to achieve special aesthetic effects. The experimental results obtained on a broad set of rocks show that the technology is viable on both technical and economic grounds, allowing to obtain excellent results at a relatively low processing cost by resorting to multiple line nozzles...|$|E

Developing is important to insure the screen printing quality. In this paper, a developer structure is designed and studied. Fluent software is {{used to analyze the}} developing process. In this way, the numerical model of nozzle is founded. The jet flow fields of different structure <b>fan-type</b> <b>nozzles</b> are analyzed and compared. Depended on the simulation results, the right nozzle is chosen and used in the developer structure, and the structure of developer is modified to fit the cleaning quality required. The experiment of new structure developer with the chosen nozzle is done, and the experiment result shows better cleaning quality with the new developer and new nozzle...|$|R
