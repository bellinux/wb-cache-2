40|$|Venting {{devices are}} the main {{solution}} for the mitigation of accidental <b>explosion.</b> However, <b>relief</b> ducts are mandatory for the discharge of combustion products to safe location. On the other hand, {{the presence of a}} duct is likely to increase the severity of the explosion with respect to simply vented vessels. To this regard, several mechanisms have been proposed to account for the enhanced violence of the explosion in such configuration: secondary explosion in the duct (burnup), frictional drag and inertia of the gas column in the duct, acoustic and Helmholtz oscillations. The relative effects of the cited phenomena and their weight on maximum pressure reached during ducted vented explosion is uncertain. As a consequence, appropriate design of ductventing configuration is still a matter of debate and it’s not surprising that the available guidelines for the design of ducted vents for gas explosions can lead to gross errors. The authors have recently proposed experimental and numerical analyses (Computational Fluid Dynamics) for the analysis of duct-vented phenomena on the peak pressure measured in either small, medium or large scale equipment. Results of these studies highlighted that the two main phenomena responsible for the increased peak pressure are: i) the explosion occurring in the initial sections of the duct leading to a backflow from the duct towards the main vessel, thus restricting the effective vent section; ii) the turbulization of flame within the combustion chamber, due to the backflow, which enhances the combustion rate and the rate of pressure rise. In this paper, we propose an engineering correlation based on semi-empirical engineering methodologies aiming at quantifying the relation between the geometric properties (venting section, duct length, vessel volume) and the peak pressure occurring in the combustion chamber {{in the presence of a}} duct fitted on the vent panel...|$|R
5|$|The North End Halifax {{neighbourhood}} of Richmond {{bore the}} brunt of the explosion. In 1917, Richmond was considered a working-class neighbourhood and had few paved roads. After the <b>explosion,</b> the Halifax <b>Relief</b> Commission approached the reconstruction of Richmond as an opportunity to improve and modernize the city's North End. English town planner Thomas Adams and Montreal architectural firm Ross and Macdonald were recruited to design a new housing plan for Richmond. Adams, inspired by the Victorian garden city movement, aimed to provide public access to green spaces and to create a low-rise, low-density and multifunctional urban neighbourhood. The planners designed 326 large homes that each faced a tree-lined, paved boulevard. They specified that the homes be built with a new and innovative fireproof material, blocks of compressed cement called Hydrostone. The first of these homes was occupied by March 1919. Once finished, the Hydrostone neighbourhood consisted of homes, businesses and parks, which helped create a new sense of community in the North End of Halifax. It has now become an upscale neighbourhood and shopping district. In contrast, the equally poor and underdeveloped area of Africville was not included in reconstruction efforts.|$|R
50|$|Special duct loading {{conditions}} may occur outside of dead, live, dust and temperature conditions. Ductwork associated with coal mills, coke grinding facilities, {{and to some}} extent grain processing facilities, may be subject to explosive dusts. Ductwork designed for explosive dust is typically designed for 50 psi internal pressure, and will typically have one <b>explosion</b> <b>relief</b> one vent per duct section. the likelihood of a dust explosion on an indirect coal mill system is 100%, over time. This can generate a plum of fire 5 ft. to 15 ft. in diameter, and 20 ft. to 30 ft. long. Therefore access to areas surrounding explosion vents shall limit personal access with locked access.|$|E
40|$|A {{standard}} spherical apparatus {{for measuring}} explosion characteristics was modified to give increased and controlled turbulence within a dust–air mixture. This {{was intended to}} mimic the local effects which may occur during industrial dust explosions, particularly secondary ones which may develop in ducts or mine galleries where the initial explosion causes an increased air velocity and suspension of further quantities of dust. The results show {{that there may be}} a doubling of the maximum explosion pressure and of the rate of pressure rise during the explosion under more turbulent conditions. This is significant for modelling of dust explosions and suggests that <b>explosion</b> <b>relief</b> may be inadequate if this factor is not taken into consideration. The modified apparatus therefore gives a laboratory method for assessing the effect of turbulence in dust explosions. Web of Science 26121420...|$|E
40|$|State {{explosion}} {{is well-known}} {{to be the}} principle limitation in protocol verification. In this paper, we propose a verification technique called leaping reachability analysis (LRA) to tackle state explosion. We advocate LRA as a uniform and property-driven relief strategy for verifying general progress properties of protocols modeled as networks of communicating finite state machines (CFSMs). Unlike most existing relief strategies in the CFSM model, LRA does not confine any of the protocol attributes and still proves to be adequate for detecting all deadlocks, all nonexecutable transitions, all unspecified receptions and all buffer overflows in a protocol. We show by experiments that LRA can largely relieve the state explosion problem by reducing significantly the amount of storage space and execution time required for verification.

40|$|<b>Explosion</b> <b>relief</b> panels or {{doors are}} often used in {{industrial}} buildings to reduce damages caused by gas explosions. Decades of research {{have contributed to the}} understanding of the phenomena involved in gas explosions in order to establish an effective method to predict reliably the explosion overpressure. All the methods predict a monotonic increase of the overpressure with the concentration of the gas in the range from the lower explosion limit to the stoichiometric one. Nevertheless, in few cases, a non-monotonic behaviour of the maximum developed pressure as a function of hydrogen concentration was reported in the literature. The non-monotonic behaviour was also observed during experimental tests performed at the Scalbatraio laboratory at the University of Pisa, in a 25 m 3 vented combustion test facility, with a vent area of 1, 12 m 2.

40|$|<b>Explosion</b> <b>relief</b> panels or {{doors are}} often used in {{industrial}} buildings to reduce damages caused by a gas explosion. Decades of research produced {{a significant contribution to}} the understanding of the phenomena involved. Among the aspects that need further research, interactions between acoustic oscillations and the flame front is one of the most important. Interactions between the flame front and acoustic oscillations has raised technical problems in lots of combustion applications as well and has been studied theoretically and experimentally in such cases. Pressure oscillations have been observed in vented deflagrations and in certain cases they are responsible for the highest pressure peak generated during the event. At Scalbatraio laboratory of Pisa University a test facility (CVE) was built in order to investigate vented hydrogen deflagrations. This paper presents an overview of the results obtained during several experimental campaigns. The tests are analysed with the focus on the investigation of flame acoustic interaction phenomena. Qualitative and quantitative analysis is presented and the generated possible physical phenomena are investigated...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims at {{contributing}} to the efficient design of explosion protection systems against confined explosions. The issue addressed concerns the quantitative estimation of the protective effect of <b>explosion</b> <b>relief</b> vents {{in the case of}} confined explosions inside tunnels. A series of virtual experiments performed by computer simulation, revealed how the number of vents, their diameter, as well as the angle between the vents and the tunnel, influences the blast wave attenuation. The computational study was performed considering a complicated large-scale tunnel configuration with branches on its half portion. The purpose was the calculation of the attenuation effect due to the presence of vents by comparing the total explosion-specific impulse developing at antidiametric positions inside the tunnel. Simulations were carried out via a three-dimensional numerical model built in the computational fluid dynamics code CFX 5. 7. 1, which has been validated in previous papers against experimental overpressure histories data demonstrating reasonable performance. Computer results showed that the use of branch vents provides an effective method for shock wave attenuation following an explosion, whereas their statistical elaboration revealed that the attenuation is mainly affected by the number of vents and their diameter. In contrast, the angle between the side vents and the main tunnel appeared to slightly affect the pressure wave weakening. Eventually, the quantitative influence of the above parameters was effectively illustrated in functional diagrams, so that the total attenuation effect may be promptly estimated, if the design variables are known. In addition, two statistical models with reasonable fitting to the calculated data are proposed, which express the attenuation effect as a dependent variable of the design variables including their interactions.

40|$|Accidental gas explosions are a {{recognised}} hazard {{in process}} industries {{but they are}} also common in residential buildings. Whilst process plants have specifically designed vent reliefs to limit the enclosure damage, in homes a similar effect is achieved due to the presence of doors and windows whose failure often protects the building. There are empirically based correlations for predicting overpressure and for vent sizing, however these are limited in application to simple enclosures. In practice, enclosures have interconnected spaces which would potentially increase the flame acceleration considerably. In this paper we present the results of full scale natural gas layer tests in a twin chamber, which consisted of two 22 m 3 enclosures connected by an open doorway. Layered natural gas/air mixtures of 8, 10 and 12 % by volume, were ignited at the rear of one of the chambers. <b>Explosion</b> <b>relief</b> was provided by vent openings of 2. 48, 1. 49 or 0. 74 m 2 on the far walls of both chambers. With tests with equal large vents on each of the chambers, the dominant influence was the external explosion. The maximum overpressure was produced by tests involving a 12 % natural gas concentration. The use of a smaller vent in the adjoining enclosure had a significant effect on the maximum overpressure and the mechanism of the explosion development. However, altering the size from 1. 49 m 2 to 0. 74 m 2 had little overall effect. This was largely due to the greater generation of turbulence and the venting process which predominantly occurred via the doorway and through the ignition-chamber vent opening. The use of a smaller vent in the ignition enclosure also altered {{the manner in which the}} explosion developed. A venting driven ‘jetting’ expanding flame, propagated into the adjoining enclosure and towards the far vent opening, generating the dominant pressure peak in these type of tests...|$|E
