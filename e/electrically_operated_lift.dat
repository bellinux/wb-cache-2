50|$|The {{most famous}} bridge ever {{constructed}} by a Teesside company was Dorman Long's Sydney Harbour Bridge of 1932, of similar construction to but not (contrary to popular belief) modelled on the 1928 Tyne Bridge, a construction {{regarded as the}} symbol of Tyneside's Geordie pride, but also a product of Dorman Long's Teesside workmanship. The greatest example of Dorman Long's work in Teesside itself is the single span Newport Lifting Bridge (a Grade II Listed Building). Opened by the Duke of York in February 1934 it was England's first vertical lift bridge. With a lifting span of 270 ft long by 66 ft wide, it is constructed from 8000 tons of Teesside steel and 28,000 tons of concrete with towers 182 ft high. The <b>electrically</b> <b>operated</b> <b>lifting</b> mechanism allowed the road to be lifted 100 ft in {{one and a half}} minutes by means of ropes passing through sheaves in the four corner towers. Newport Bridge is no longer raised or lowered; it is a permanent road crossing the River Tees.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This {{omni-directional}} wheelchair {{was designed}} for the less abled elderly to move more flexibly in narrow spaces, such as elevators or small aisle. We have constructed one dexterous three-wheeled wheelchair with smooth omni-directional motion. It does not only keep the merit of the existing manual and electrical operated wheelchair, but also with a novel omni-directional mobility system. Elderly people can easily operate such device in most environments. We implemented the dexterous and complicated mechanisms to allow such an <b>electrically</b> <b>operated</b> wheelchair to move forward at any direction that is far easier manoeuvred than any traditional electronic wheelchairs. We carried on improvements for design, mechanical and control system of this <b>electrically</b> <b>operated</b> wheelchair, {{and the development of}} smart automatic charge system and lastly a collision-evading system.
