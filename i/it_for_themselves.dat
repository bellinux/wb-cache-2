5|$|Controversy {{surrounds}} the breakout {{before the last}} stand—which various writers have posited might have actually been desertion—and a box of gold sovereigns, which a Matabele inDuna (leader) later claimed {{had been given to}} two unidentified men from Forbes's rear guard on 2 December, along with a message that Lobengula admitted defeat and wanted the column to stop pursuing him. Two batmen were initially found guilty of accepting the gold, keeping <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> and not passing on the message, but the evidence against them was inconclusive and largely circumstantial; the convictions were ultimately overturned.|$|E
5|$|Two officers' batmen, William Charles Daniel and James Wilson (no {{relation}} to Allan Wilson), soon became prime suspects, with Daniel arraigned as the senior instigator. They {{were accused of}} accepting the gold from Petchan and Sehuloholu, then keeping <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> and not passing on the message. Both men denied all charges. Neither Daniel nor Wilson had been members of the rear guard on 2 December, though either or both could have been there {{at some point during}} the day. No Matabele witness recognised either of them at the court in Bulawayo, where the case was heard by the Resident Magistrate and four assessors.|$|E
5|$|Extraterrestrial {{technology}} could have profound {{impacts on the}} nature of human culture and civilization. Just as television provided a new outlet {{for a wide variety of}} political, religious, and social groups, and as the printing press made the Bible available to the common people of Europe, allowing them to interpret <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves,</b> so an extraterrestrial technology might change humanity in ways not immediately apparent. Harrison speculates that a knowledge of extraterrestrial technologies could increase the gap between scientific and cultural progress, leading to societal shock and an inability to compensate for negative effects of technology. He gives the example of improvements in agricultural technology during the Industrial Revolution, which displaced thousands of farm laborers until society could retrain them for jobs suited to the new social order. Contact with an extraterrestrial civilization far more advanced than humanity could cause a much greater shock than the Industrial Revolution, or anything previously experienced by humanity.|$|E

5|$|Ten years later, J. D. Redding and {{his teenage}} {{daughter}} Tory rent the O'Grady farmhouse for the summer. Contract workers Nathan Murphy, his 12-year-old brother Alex, and their dimwitted friend Ozzie Jones help re-paint the farmhouse. While {{looking around the}} basement, Ozzie hears the leprechaun's cry for help and mistakes him for a little child. He brushes the old four-leaf clover off the crate, freeing the leprechaun. After failing to convince the others that he met a leprechaun, Ozzie spots a rainbow and chases it, believing he will find a pot of gold at the end. Alex accompanies him for fear Ozzie might hurt himself. A bag of one hundred gold pieces magically appears before Ozzie. After Ozzie tests the gold and accidentally swallows a piece, they stash it in an old well and plot to keep <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves,</b> hoping to fix Ozzie's brain.|$|E

Edge and the dragon battle rampaging monsters and destroy the infested Grig Orig.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} mass media on attitudes toward intellect are {{certainly}} multiple and ambiguous.

25|$|Individualized {{learning}} was also integral to {{his theory of}} child education.

Montaigne believed that a child’s curiosity could serve as an important teaching tool when the child is allowed to explore the things that they are curious about.|$|E

Afterwards, Władysław [...] completed the takeover of Lesser Poland, entering Kraków, and took the lands north of there, through Kuyavia {{all the way to}} Gdańsk Pomerania. In 1308, Pomerania was conquered by the Brandenburg state.

Will is later called into Principal Figgins' (Iqbal Theba) office, where he learns that Finn has been suspended for walking through the hallway in his underwear, attempting to become comfortable with his costume. He convinces Figgins to reduce Finn's punishment, and the episode returns to the opening scene as Carl confronts Will over his private rehearsal with Emma. Alerted to Sue's planned exposé, Will concedes that his motivations in putting on the production were questionable. He tells Emma that he will cease interfering with her relationship.

500|$|French plantation-owners {{worked their}} African slaves {{so hard that}} half died within a few years; it was cheaper to import new slaves than to improve working {{conditions}} enough to increase survival. The rate of death of slaves on Saint Domingue's plantations was higher {{than anywhere else in}} the western hemisphere. [...] Over the French colony's hundred-year course, slavery killed about a million Africans, and thousands more chose suicide. Slaves newly arrived from Africa, particularly women, were especially likely to kill themselves; some thought that in death they could return home to Africa. [...] Pregnant slaves usually did not survive long enough or have healthy enough pregnancies to have live babies, but if they did the children often died young. Food was insufficient, and slaves were expected to grow and prepare <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> on top of their already crushing, 12-hour workdays. It was legal for a slaveholder to kill a slave who hit a white person, according to the 1685 Code Noir, a decree by the French king Louis XIV regulating practices of slaves and slavers.|$|E
500|$|Byrne {{has written}} for Wired, {{outlining}} {{the relative merits of}} different distribution models with this one reflecting his [...] "self-distributionmodel" [...] in which [...] "the artist stands to receive the largest percentage of income from sales per unit—sales of anything. A larger percentage of fewer sales, most likely, but not always. Artists doing <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> can actually make more money than the massive popstar, even though the sales numbers may seem minuscule by comparison." [...] The motivation for creating and marketing this album directly came in part from the very article Byrne wrote as well as Eno's belief that music fans want more than just the music on an album and prefer collectible deluxe editions as well as the live performances that promote them. A month after releasing the album, Byrne was skeptical of market saturation claiming [...] "I sense {{that a lot of people}} don't know we have a record out" [...] and hoped to counterbalance that ignorance with his tour. He also described the digital music market as [...] "so infinite [...] it's easy for music to get lost out there" [...] and has noted that this business model would not work for performers who are not already established.|$|E

500|$|Three contestants {{are each}} given a card {{to start a}} {{blackjack}} hand from a standard 52-card deck shuffled prior to taping. Ribeiro reads multiple-choice questions and the first contestant to answer correctly earns 100 points. The contestant who answered correctly can freeze their hand, [...] preventing them from receiving additional cards or reveal the next card {{from the top of}} the deck. After revealing the card, the contestant can either accept <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> or pass it to one of their opponents who has not yet frozen. If keeping a card, the contestant in control is given another chance to freeze. However, once a contestant has frozen, the remaining contestants must freeze at a score higher than that contestant; ties are not permitted. A contestant is eliminated from the round if their hand exceeds 21. The process is repeated with additional questions and cards until two contestants have frozen or bust. A contestant whose score reaches 21 exactly instantly wins the round and, beginning in season two, a bonus prize which is given to the contestant regardless of the outcome of the game. If two contestants bust, the remaining contestant automatically wins the round. If only one contestant has not yet frozen or busted, no additional questions are asked; the remaining contestant simply continues drawing cards until either beating the highest frozen hand or busting. The winner of this round receives 500 points and a power chip to use in the bonus round, assuming that contestant gets that far. After two rounds, the contestant with the lowest score is eliminated. The two remaining contestants play one more round involving the same toss-up question format, but point scores are not kept. The contestant who wins the round receives $1,000 and two additional power chips (originally one), then moves on to the bonus round.|$|E

[...] "The Seven Dwarfs and the Christmas Fairy" [...] (I Sette Nani e la fatina di Natale) presents a scenario in which the Queen successfully casts a forever-sleep enchantment on Snow White, but while trying to zap Dopey she accidentally falls victim of her own witchcraft and the Christmas fairy, freed from her prison, saves Snow White.
