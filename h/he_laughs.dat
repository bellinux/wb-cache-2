5|$|The {{script is}} {{characterized}} by numerous inexplicable mood and personality shifts in characters. In analyzing the film's abrupt tone shifts, Greg Sestero highlighted two scenes in particular. In the first scene, Johnny enters the rooftop {{in the middle of}} a tirade about being accused of domestic abuse, only to become abruptly cheerful upon seeing Mark; a few moments later, <b>he</b> <b>laughs</b> inappropriately upon learning that a friend of Mark's had been severely beaten. On set, Sestero and first assistant director Sandy Schklair repeatedly tried to convince Wiseau that the line should not be delivered as comical, but Wiseau refused to refrain from laughing. In the second instance, occurring a few scenes later, Mark attempts to kill Peter by throwing him off a roof after Peter expresses his belief that Mark is having an affair with Lisa; just as Peter is about to fall to his death, Mark pulls Peter back over the edge of the roof, apologizes, and the two continue their previous conversation with no acknowledgement of what just occurred.|$|E
5|$|After VJ Patterson (Felix Dean) is bullied by Riley Radcliffe (Tani Edgecombe) {{he goes to}} see {{his father}} Ian (Ben Simpson) but <b>he</b> <b>laughs</b> it off. Miles is {{attacked}} and beaten and presumes it was Ian. He later finds out {{it was in fact}} Riley and his friends. He tries to drag Riley to the police station but he breaks his wrist. Miles is arrested for assault. Ian blackmails him saying he will drop the charges for money, the police find out Ian was responsible for the injuries. However the newspapers published an article on Miles branding him a thug. Miles destroys a classroom and Gina Austin (Sonia Todd) forces him to take leave. He starts drinking heavily again, makes a pass at Leah and sleeps on the beach. Miles begins having visions of a girl called Rabbit, who tells him about future events. She convinces him to do good deeds. Miles becomes good friends with Elijah Johnson (Jay Laga'aia) and he goes to Africa with him. On his return he is assaulted by Heath Braxton (Daniel Ewing). He then gets drunk and kisses Roo Stewart (Georgie Parker) and wakes up next to her in the morning. He later confesses his love to Leah and they start a relationship. Elijah is initially annoyed, but they repair their friendship. Leah learns she is pregnant, which delights Miles. Leah is initially hesitant about going ahead with the pregnancy, but she and Miles talk and she decides to keep the baby. Miles proposes to Leah, but she turns him down, saying they are not ready. She later asks him to move in with her and VJ. Leah suffers a miscarriage, which devastates Miles. The couple struggle with their grief and Miles moves out. He and Leah later break up. Miles learns Elijah is still in love with Leah. Miles tells Marilyn that Sally has got him a teaching job in Thailand and he leaves the Summer Bay.|$|E
25|$|The domovoi {{is also an}} oracle, as his {{behavior}} foretells or forewarns about the future. If <b>he</b> <b>laughs,</b> sings, jokes, or dances good times can be expected, and if he strums a comb there is a wedding in the future, but if he wails at night, extinguishes a candle or makes himself visible it means a family member, usually {{the head of the}} household, will die. The touch of the domovoi is also a harbinger. If his furry hand feels warm, good fortune is indicated; however, if his touch is icy cold, misfortune is coming.|$|E

[...] According to Basu, after Kapoor, Chopra and D'cruz's character Saurabh Shukla's character as Inspector Dutta was the most important. Basu described the role as [...] "amazing" [...] character, who makes others cry when <b>he</b> <b>laughs.</b>|$|E
500|$|The post-War Christmas toy extravaganza had its seed in Clement Clarke Moore's A Visit from St. Nicholas. There, Saint Nicholas is {{depicted}} {{not as the}} thin, somewhat forbidding, charity dispensing character of European lore but as a dimpled, [...] "jolly old elf" [...] whose stomach shakes like [...] "a bowlful of jelly" [...] when <b>he</b> <b>laughs,</b> and who enters a dwelling through the chimney with a pack of toys on his back.|$|E
500|$|By mid-1848, van Hoëvell {{had become}} too {{controversial}} and perhaps too important to those who disagreed with the local government, and {{under pressure from the}} Governor-General he resigned his post on 19 July 1848. After a packed final service in the Willemskerk in August, he was sent off by [...] "half the population of Batavia"; his final sermon, based on Epistle to the Hebrews 13:18–19, suggested that he hoped to return to the Indies. Later, he characterized the Governor-General as more powerful than the Dutch king: [...] "he is the sun, at which all eyes are aimed; when <b>he</b> <b>laughs,</b> everyone laughs; if he looks serious, then the entire multitude frowns its face." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>laughed</b> at me, and jeered, {{and told}} me tales of ghosts and of the dead that walk at night. But mostly did <b>he</b> <b>laugh</b> at my feeble fancy. I told him more, and <b>he</b> <b>laughed</b> the harder. I swore in all earnestness that these things were so, {{and he began to}} look upon me queerly. Also, he gave amazing garblings of my tales to our playmates, until all began to look upon me queerly.|$|R

500|$|... {{is one of}} two aliens {{who come}} to Earth to aid Quiche after Quiche {{continues}} losing to the Mew Mews. Energetic and often childish, Tart taunts Quiche for losing to the Mew Mews by saying he is weak. He primarily fights using physical attacks and chimera animals, but is also capable of manipulating plants to bind people and attacking with an energy beam. Tartu shows a distinct dislike for Ichigo and refers to her as an [...] "old woman" [...] when they encounter one another, only to be called a [...] "midget" [...] in return. Midway through the series, Tart and Pie capture Bu-Ling and hold her hostage under the Tokyo Dome. While guarding her, Tart appears to be bewildered by her refusal to be scared and her attempts to befriend him. After she is freed by the others, <b>he</b> <b>laughs</b> while looking at some candy she gave him. The anime adaptation expands this incident by having Tart save Bu-Ling's life when she starts to suffocate after the cavern is sealed off. At the end of the manga Bu-Ling kisses him and he tells Bu-Ling that he might return to get another candy drop from her, and leaves for his own world. In the anime adaptation, Tart is killed by Pie when he tries to protect the Mew Mews, and revived by the final release of Mew Aqua {{at the end of the}} series.|$|E
2500|$|Ben symbolizes {{another kind}} of {{successful}} American Dream for Willy: to catch opportunity, to conquer nature, and to gain a fortune. His mantra goes: “Why, boys, when I was seventeen I walked into the jungle, and when I was twenty-one I walked out. (<b>He</b> <b>laughs.)</b> And by God I was rich.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The chorus enjoys {{themselves}} at the picnic ("I ain't got no shame"). Sportin' Life presents the chorus his cynical views on the Bible ("It Ain't Necessarily So"), causing Serena to chastise them ("Shame on all you sinners!"). Everyone gets ready to leave. As Bess, who has lagged behind, tries to follow them, Crown emerges from the bushes. He reminds her that Porgy is [...] "temporary" [...] and laughs off her claims {{that she has been}} living decently now. Bess wants to leave Crown forever and attempts to make him forget about her ("Oh, what you want wid Bess?") but Crown refuses to give her up. He grabs her and will not let her go to the boat, which leaves without her, and then forcefully kisses her. <b>He</b> <b>laughs</b> at his conquest as her resistance begins to fail, and commands her to get into the woods, where his intentions are only too clear.|$|E

2500|$|The four races {{divide the}} land up into sectors {{to search for}} the final herb, and shortly thereafter, the Vikings locate it. Their priests begin to harvest it, but the Dark Tribe soon arrive, and the Trojans develop a poison to use on the herb should the Vikings be unable to harvest it in time. The Viking priest is ambushed and killed, and the Dark Tribe acquire the herb. However, it remains unclear if the priest was able to use the poison before his death. Meanwhile, Morbus's temple is located, and the Trojans lead an assault. They succeed in {{destroying}} it, but not before Morbus is able to create and drink the elixir. Emerging from the ruins of his temple to see the greenery surrounding it, <b>he</b> <b>laughs</b> and declares [...] "nothing can stop me now." [...] The game then cuts to some time later; {{on the site of the}} temple now stands a small cottage with a garden full of blooming flowers. Morbus then emerges from the cottage and happily attends to his garden, fully cured of his hatred of foliage.|$|E

60|$|Young Raoul <b>laughed.</b> <b>He</b> <b>laughed</b> {{long and}} heartily. But while <b>he</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>he</b> {{secretly}} performed problems in mental arithmetic. He had never built {{a house in}} his life, and his notions concerning house building were hazy. While <b>he</b> <b>laughed,</b> <b>he</b> calculated {{the cost of the}} voyage to Tahiti for materials, of the materials themselves, of the voyage back again to Fakarava, and the cost of landing the materials and of building the house. It would come to four thousand French dollars, allowing a margin for safety--four thousand French dollars were equivalent to twenty thousand francs. It was impossible. How was he to know the value of such a pearl? Twenty thousand francs was a lot of money--and of his mother's money at that.|$|R
