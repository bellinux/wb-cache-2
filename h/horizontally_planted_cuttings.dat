40|$|In willow cultivation, {{successful}} {{establishment is}} crucial {{for the development of}} a willow crop. The overall objective of this study was to assess the effects of pre-emergence cutting characteristics on the performance of willow during early establishment. In the experiments described in this thesis, cuttings of different size, position on the original rod, quality (i. e. planting damages and storage effects), orientation (i. e. vertical or horizontal planting), and clone were planted in the field or in boxes in an outdoor enclosure. Effects of weed competition and nitrogen fertilization were tested in a bucket experiment, and long-term effects of cutting characteristics on development and growth were evaluated in a field experiment harvested twice between 2008 and 2015. Cutting characteristics had a significant influence on the early establishment of willow. Cutting size had the most apparent influence, with performance generally increasing with increased size. There was a tendency for this effect to level off beyond a certain size. Cuttings sprouted earlier if derived from the apex, and the majority of the shoots on <b>horizontally</b> <b>planted</b> <b>cuttings</b> originated from the apical part. Cutting damage caused by storage or machine planting on compacted soil resulted in decreased performance and increased variation. Cuttings planted on compacted soil had higher probability of being damaged or landing on the soil surface instead of in the soil. Vertically planted cuttings were generally preferable to <b>horizontally</b> <b>planted</b> <b>cuttings,</b> especially when considering the amount of planting material needed. If planted horizontally, the depth should not exceed 5 cm. Weed competition resulted in a considerable decrease in performance if weeds sprouted before the willow had reached sufficient size. Nitrogen fertilization was likely to be of more use to the weeds than to the willow. In the long-term experiment, stool weight increased with cutting weight and early plant size at both harvests, indicating that the initial size hierarchy was maintained during the entire experiment. The performance responses in the experiments varied depending on clone...|$|E

Seven planting techniques: Inclined, forming 45 to 60 ° angle with the ridge, but leaving one-third above ground (I 1 / 3); inclined, forming 45 to 60 ° angle with the ridge and the soil covering the whole cutting (ICOV); vertical planting leaving {{one third of the}} cuttings above ground level (V 1 / 3); vertical with the soil covering the whole cutting (VCOV); horizontal, at 10 cm below the top of the ridge (H 10); horizontal at 15 cm below the top of the ridge (V 15); and horizontal 20 cm below the top of the ridge (H 20) were evaluated in the experiment. Vertical planting leaving one-third above ground had significantly (P= 0. 05) the highest establishment. The low crop establishments were observed from <b>horizontally</b> <b>planted</b> <b>cuttings</b> where crop establishment decreased with depth of planting giving 36, 33 and 15 % for materials that were planted at 10, 15 and 20 cm below ground respectively.

40|$|<b>Plant</b> <b>cutting</b> is a {{technique}} for propagating plants in which {{a piece of the}} source <b>plant,</b> called the <b>cutting,</b> is placed in the soil to grow as an indipendent <b>plant.</b> The <b>cutting</b> produces new roots and stems, and thus becomes a new plant.

The process starts with a single stem of the parent plant, with no branches. The system is able to cut the stem for producing the cutting, to remove the leaves from its basal part, and to manipulate it for the hormone subministration and for the insertion in the substrate.

40|$|Abstract — Tidal flood, {{erosion and}} {{sedimentation}} are {{serious problem in}} Nord of Central Java-Indonesia. Many spots experience functional coastal land disturbance. This research, therefore, is aimed to identify coastal problems and analyze the causes and bring up some alternative engineering solution. The research method used is to hold a survey at the damaged location of the coast, to analyze the characteristics of hydrooceanography and spatial measurement and the alternative engineering solution. The total of coastal line of the studied coast based on Geographical Information System is 427, 01 kilometers, covering 13 regencies and towns in Central Java Province. The dominant problem found at the studied location are tidal flood, erosion, estuary closing, sedimentation and sea water intrusion caused by the impact of coastal area development, mangrove <b>plant</b> <b>cutting,</b> and coral destruction. The most infrastructure built is port facilities without assisting building for anticipating impact. Mangrove <b>plant</b> <b>cutting</b> is due to extension of fish pool. Coral materials are exploited and traded. Generally the alternative engineering solution is protection with hard structure (groins, seawall), and with soft structure by replanting mangrove plants.
