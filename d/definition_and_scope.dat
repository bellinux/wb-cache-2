500|$|Philosophy of {{economics}} is {{the branch of}} philosophy which studies philosophical issues relating to economics.

The first concerns the <b>definition</b> <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> of economics and by what methods it should be studied and whether these methods {{rise to the level of}} epistemic reliability associated with the other special sciences. For example, is it possible to research economics in such a way that it is value-free, establishing facts that are independent of the normative views of the researcher? The second topic is the meaning and implications of rationality. For example, can buying lottery tickets (increasing the riskiness of your income) at the same time as buying insurance (decreasing the riskiness of your income) be rational? The third topic is the normative evaluation of economic policies and outcomes. What criteria should be used to determine whether a given public policy is beneficial for society? ...|$|E

The new questionnaire included a more comprehensive set of questions about seven basic issues relating to the TSA to identify the degree and methods of implementation of the recommended framework at different levels such as the following: The conceptual level.

Process safety {{can be measured in}} three strata: (1) measurement of process safety elements within facilities; (2) benchmarking of process safety elements among facilities; and (3) use of incident data collection from various sources for industrial safety performance assessment. The methods presently available for measurement of process safety within facilities are deficient because the results are strongly dependent on user judgment. Performance benchmarking among facilities is done within closed groups of organizations. Neither the questionnaires nor the results are available to the public.

50|$|As {{seen from}} the {{foregoing}} discussion, the clans of the Parama Kambojas (Asii), Lohas and Rishikas (Tukharas?) also fell into the Scythian region, said to belong to Amyurgian Scythians of Herodotus. Majavat, the land of Soma, apparently fell within the domain of Parama Kambojas in Pamirs (Munjan or Muztagh Atta?). Like other Scythian clans, the Parama Kambojas also may have practiced Soma cult and thus they fell within the Persian/Herodotean <b>definition</b> <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> of Haumvargas/Amyurgios. Otherwise, they were a distinct tribe from the Sakas but were undoubtedly Scythian if one follows the classical definition of Megasthenes, Diodorus, Ptolemy, Pliny the Elder and Strabo etc. No doubt, that the linguistic traces of ancient Kamboja language have been seen in several modern languages of the Pamirs, Khotan and Sogdiana. The Parama Kambojas were obviously living within Scythia of the classical writers or the Shakadvipa of the Indian texts. Their land was also alternatively known as Kumuda-dvipa. And they were known by other names like Asii (from Aswa), Homodites (from Mt Hemodos, Emode, Oimode/Oemeda) of classical and, Xiuxun, Wai- etc. of the Chinese writings. They have been lumped together with other tribes of south-east Scythia and all called by the general name Sacae by Greeks and Sakas by the Iranic sources.
