500|$|After leaving Hollywood in the mid-1960s, Baker {{travelled}} with Bob Hope's Christmas USO troupe entertaining {{soldiers in}} Vietnam and Southeast Asia, an experience which she described as reformative: [...] "In the hospitals I held {{the hands of}} damaged young men, and <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> pain was not exclusive: that in this world there was suffering much more terrible than mine." ...|$|E

"I've {{considered}} [...] for two years, and in {{the last}} six months, it's seemed real clear to me. <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> job would become my career if I stayed. Some people stay with a series until the end, you know, and afterwards they often have some problems, I think, finding new opportunities. And I wanted a career after Dallas. There's great sadness in leaving my friends and the show – I was never bored with it – but I'm not at all ambivalent about this. I'm realistic about taking care of myself financially. I didn't want to walk away blindly without plans. My plans are set. I have a project with a network that is ready to go that I can't talk about yet. It's a drama mystery." ...|$|E

He was always adding to it; you only have to look at his proofs to see that. <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> own way was in impoverishment, in lack of knowledge and in taking away, in subtracting rather than in adding." ...|$|E

I, Lawrence Klein, was born in Omaha, Nebraska, as were my elder brother and younger sister.

5000|$|Pius said to Father Scavizzi [...] "I {{have often}} {{considered}} excommunication, to castigate {{in the eyes}} of the entire world the fearful crime of genocide. But after much praying and many tears, <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> condemnation would not only fail to help the Jews, it might even worsen their situation ... No doubt a protest would gain me the praise and respect of the civilized world, but it would have submitted the poor Jews to an even worse persecution." ...|$|R
2500|$|On 21 February 2011, Ančić {{announced}} his retirement from professional tennis due to recurring mononucleosis. He ended his career with three titles, 208 wins and 135 losses. On 23 February 2011, Ančić {{held a press conference}} at the Firule tennis club, where he officially retired from professional tennis. He stated that; [...] " [...] heart wanted, but [...] body couldn't, this is the toughest moment of my life. I have never run away from responsibility. I always strived for perfection, and when <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> body cannot provide the kind of tennis I can play, there was no other solution".|$|E

40|$|In this essay, I {{begin with}} what I {{thought was a}} simple thesis statement, and {{investigate}} my assumptions about race, culture, and identity {{in the context of}} slam poetry. I engage critically with slam poetry as a genre and as a cultural event, while probing my assumptions with a combination of psychology and literary theory. In the end, <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> original goal was impossible given the language I was operating in, and posit that a new language is needed to explore these complex issues...|$|R
5000|$|Canadian Defence Minister Peter MacKay {{called on}} Fox to {{apologize}} for the satirical comments, describing the remarks as [...] "despicable, hurtful and ignorant." [...] Gutfeld in response maintained the show is satirical and irreverent but offered the following apology: [...] "The March 17 episode of Red Eye included a segment discussing Canada's plan for a 'synchronized break,' which {{was in no way}} an attempt to make light of troop efforts. However, <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> words may have been misunderstood. It was not my intent to disrespect the brave men, women and families of the Canadian military, and for that I apologize." ...|$|R
6000|$|For hours I sat dully brooding. What a trap I was in. In my rummagings in the Monnerie library I {{had once}} chanced {{on a few}} yellow cardboard-covered novels tucked away in a cupboard, and had paddled {{in one or two}} of them. Now <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> life also was nothing but [...] "a Shocker." [...] So people {{actually}} suffered and endured the horrible things written about in cheap, common books.|$|E
6000|$|I {{started up}} in very {{unpleasant}} surprise. Until this moment I had given no heed to the cur whom we had captured twice, since {{we left the}} burning fleet at Pig Point; but now <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> partner was right. There could be no question but that Elias Macomber was a free man once more, and all our efforts {{to bring him to}} justice had only resulted in giving him an opportunity to pose as a martyr! ...|$|E
60|$|We were {{interrupted}} {{at this juncture}} by the approach {{of one of the}} warriors, bearing arms, accouterments and ornaments, and in a flash one of her questions was answered and a puzzle cleared up for me. I saw that the body of my dead antagonist had been stripped, and I read in the menacing yet respectful attitude of the warrior who had brought me these trophies of the kill the same demeanor as that evinced by the other who had brought me my original equipment, and {{now for the first time}} <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> blow, on the occasion of my first battle in the audience chamber had resulted in the death of my adversary.|$|E

The yookoohoo magic is admitted to be very strange in its workings and different from the magic usually practiced, but perhaps Glinda or Ozma may understand it better than I. In them lies our only hope. Unless they can help us, we must remain forever as we are." ...|$|R
60|$|No {{sooner had}} I done this, {{and he began}} to breathe more freely, than <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> by <b>my</b> assault <b>I</b> had {{increased}} the danger, for surely, even at that time of night, those living near about must have heard that shrill, frantic cry.|$|R

6000|$|I {{looked for}} quite a long time in the hope of seeing {{something}} of my Lady. The quarters chimed several times, but I stood on unheeding. At last I thought I saw far off in the very corner of the old defending wall a flicker of white. It was but momentary, and could hardly have accounted in itself for the way my heart beat. I controlled myself, and stood as though I, too, were a graven image. I was rewarded by seeing presently another gleam of white. And then an unspeakable rapture stole over me as <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> Lady was coming as she had come before. I would have hurried out to meet her, but that I knew well that this would not be in accord with her wishes. So, thinking to please her, I drew back into the room. I was glad I had done so when, from the dark corner where I stood, I saw her steal up the marble steps and stand timidly looking in at the door. Then, after a long pause, came a whisper as faint and sweet as the music of a distant AEolian harp: ...|$|E
6000|$|Marjorie was my all, and I {{could no}} longer endure the tension of her gradual decline. As I watched her fade away, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> closest friends were {{becoming}} reconciled to my bereavement, with the philosophical fortitude of spectators. When I was coolly advised [...] "not to sacrifice pecuniary interests for the sentiment of a hopeless experiment," [...] an outraged love grew strong and defiant. The calculating counsel, so cruel and unexpected, strengthened, at last, the timid resolution. Even the silent walls of my house oppressed, while an absolute hatred of the machinery of life seized my tired soul. I determined to be free at any price. Fresh courage entered my life, and impelled me to remove, without a pang, most cherished household gods. My relief was immoderate when everything was gone. Then I experienced {{for the first time}} in years the sweet exhilaration that welcomes, breathlessly, a change. In my dreams I had apparitions of purple mountains, and long quiet days purified with sunshine. Suddenly, into my sad life there came new hope, kindled, it seemed, from the very ashes of an abortive past.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is he a member?" [...] said {{someone in}} the background, and {{somebody}} else suggested calling a policeman. I perceived that only a prompt retreat would save {{the whole story of}} our quarrel from the newspapers. So far as I could see nobody knew me there except Philip. I had to take the risks of his behavior; manifestly I couldn't control it. I made no further attempt to explain anything to anybody. Everyone was a little too perplexed for prompt action, and so the advantage in that matter lay with me. I walked through the door, and with what I imagined to be an appearance of the utmost serenity down the steps. I noted an ascending member glance at me with an expression of exceptional interest, but it was only after I had traversed the length of Pall Mall that <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> lip and the corner of my nostril were both bleeding profusely. I called a cab when I discovered my handkerchief scarlet, and retreated to my flat and cold ablutions. Then I sat down to write a letter to Tarvrille, with a clamorous [...] "Urgent, Please forward if away" [...] above the address, and tell him at least to suppress Philip. But within the club that blockhead, thinking of nothing but the appearances of our fight and his own credit, was varying his assertion that he had thrashed me, with denunciations of me as a [...] "blackguard," [...] and giving half a dozen men a highly colored, improvised, and altogether improbable account of my relentless pursuit and persecution of Lady Mary Justin, and how she had left London to avoid me. They listened, no doubt, with extreme avidity. The matrimonial relations of the Justins had long been a matter for speculative minds.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you count}} on going forward without {{learning}} if Simon Kenton may {{be among the}} savages?" [...] he asked, and a flood of shame came over me as <b>I</b> thus <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> own danger had caused me to forget the scout {{at a time when}} his possible fate should have been uppermost in mind.|$|R
5000|$|Soon {{after his}} arrival in Diyarbakır, a center of {{conflict}} with Kurdish separatists and guerillas, [...] he made an announcement on police radio: [...] "From 3310 (Okkan's badge number) to HQ. Since two days, I have been on inspection in the city, and <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> colleagues {{have no sense of}} duty. This is my first and last warning." [...] This announcement was a sign of what he was not, the sort of his predecessor police chiefs. One of his first official activities before assuming office was to unblock {{the street in front of}} the police headquarters, which was barred to civilians for security reasons. He soon also lifted the security roadblocks within the city and installed surveillance cameras covering critical locations in the city for crime prevention. Okkan used to observe the streets of Diyarbakır on the giant monitor in his office during the evening.|$|R
50|$|<b>I</b> quickly <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> opinion piece {{would never}} have been {{published}} in a Quebec-based newspaper. Representatives from all the mainstream media sit on the QPC, and they would all know instinctively what would pass muster and what wouldn't. So in fact, even though the council has no legal power, it has strong moral power amongst its constituents. So they self-censure before they publish.|$|R
60|$|I cannot say {{how long}} I stood there motionless. As soon as I came to myself <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> only chance {{was to keep}} quiet. I tried to think. The {{probability}} {{was that they were}} not far away, and if they heard nothing for {{a quarter of an hour}} or so they might open the door and let me out. So I stood still, with my eyes riveted on the thing where It lay. It did not cry out again, and I hoped against hope that It had not seen me. As I became accustomed to the room I heard It breathing quite like a human being. This reassured me to some extent, for I saw that It must be asleep. The question was--Might not the sleep be disturbed at any moment, and in that case, what should I do? I remembered the story of the man who met a wild beast in the jungle and subjugated it by the power of the human eye. I thought I would try that. All the time I kept glaring at It's lair (for I could not distinguish itself), and the two things mixed themselves up in my mind till I thought I was trying the experiment at that moment. Next it struck me that the whole thing was perhaps a mistake. The servant had merely shown me into the wrong room. Yes; but why had the door been locked? After all, was I sure that it was locked? I crept closer to the door, and with my eyes still fixed on the corner, put my hand gently--oh, so gently!--on the handle. Softly I turned it round. I felt like a burglar. The door would not open. Losing all self-control, I shook it; and then again came that unnatural cry. I stood as if turned to stone, still clutching the door handle, lest it should squeak if I let it go. Then I listened for the breathing. In a few moments I heard It. Before It had horrified me; now It was like sweet music, and I resumed breathing myself. I kept close to the wall, ready for anything; and then I had a strange notion. As It was asleep, why should I not creep forward and have a look at It? I yielded to this impulse.|$|E
5000|$|... "You have to {{also get}} out of {{thinking}} that your life is {{the most interesting thing}} you have to write about. I had to write about myself when I started out, it was therapy.

5000|$|In {{an article}} by Serge Basset printed in Le Matin in 1890, Rodin said: [...] "For a whole year I lived with Dante, with him alone, drawing the circles of his inferno.

5000|$|When {{asked about}} Melendez's new role, Leno stated that Melendez {{would appear in}} comedy {{segments}} during the show and that the new show {{would not have a}} studio announcer.

60|$|I {{had grown}} cool again, and <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> perhaps <b>my</b> show of anger had been imprudent.

Going early in {{the afternoon of the}} morrow to visit Anne, I found her in tears--tears, as I was to discover, of anger.|$|R
2500|$|Despite {{positive}} critical {{reviews and}} success in the music charts, the album became controversial due to the lyrics of [...] "Zezé" [...] and the audio samples used in the bonus track [...] "Twenty Three" [...] (not {{to be confused with}} the similarly-titled lead single). On November 4, the Korean publisher of the novel My Sweet Orange Tree, from which IU drew inspiration for the song [...] "Zezé", stirred debate in the entertainment industry on freedom of interpretation when it leveled criticisms at IU for her interpretation of the five-year-old protagonist as a [...] "sexual object". Two days later, IU issued a public statement: [...] "I did not mean to turn Zeze into a sexual object... but <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> lyrics have offended many, and for this I apologize." [...] On November 10, the publisher released an apology for its failure to acknowledge [...] "diversity of interpretation." [...] For the bonus track [...] "Twenty Three", voice samples from Britney Spears' [...] "Gimme More" [...] were allegedly used without permission. Billboard ranked Chat-Shire the sixth best K-pop album of 2015, explaining that [...] "IU knows how to take the sounds of yesterday and update them to stunning results." ...|$|R
