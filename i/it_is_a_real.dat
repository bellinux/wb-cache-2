500|$|The lexical {{decision}} task involves subjects seeing {{or hearing}} an isolated word and answering {{whether or not}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> word. [...] It is frequently used in priming studies, since subjects are known to make a lexical decision more quickly if a word has been primed by a related word (as in [...] "doctor" [...] priming [...] "nurse").|$|E

500|$|The {{completion}} of [...] is another field in which, informally speaking, the [...] "gaps" [...] {{in the original}} field [...] are filled, if there are any. For example, any irrational number , such as , is a [...] "gap" [...] {{in the sense that}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> number that can be approximated arbitrarily closely by rational numbers , in the sense that distance of [...] and [...] given by the absolute value [...] is as small as desired.|$|E

BMO insists that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>real,</b> living boy, and attempts to demonstrate this to Football by brushing its teeth and using the toilet. Unbeknownst to BMO, Finn and Jake are watching the activity from outside a window. The focus then shifts to Finn and Jake, who attempt to experience the ultimate high five. Eventually, Finn places himself in a catapult, and Jake stretches himself into a slingshot, and the two launch themselves across Ooo.|$|E
500|$|As the {{popularity}} and marketability {{of the natural}} world rose during the late 19th century, books dedicated to nature came to be in great demand. One reviewer noted in 1901 that [...] "It {{is a part of the}} progress of the day that the Nature study is coming into prominence in our schemes of education, and, beyond these, is entering into our plans for coveted diversion, yet <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> surprise that so large and increasing a number of each season's publications are devoted to the purpose." [...] Such literature was regularly published in a wide variety of subjects: children's animal books, wilderness novels, nature guides, and travelogues were all immensely popular. The study of nature quickly became part of the public school curriculum, making nature writing increasingly profitable. As the public's hunger for such imaginative works grew, a new genre in which nature was depicted in a compassionate, rather than realistic, light began to take form.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{its premiere}} at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival, Artifact was favorably {{received}} by critics and audiences for its {{look inside the}} state of the modern recording industry. It received a standing ovation and won the People's Choice Award for Best Documentary. Jason Gorber, writing for Twitch Film, described Artifact as an interesting film [...] "asking a number of important questions about the commerce of art, and does so in an engaging way." [...] Film critic Kenji Lloyd awarded Artifact five stars out of five and called it [...] "one of the greatest music documentaries ever made, and an important documentary for our times." [...] He felt that the film [...] "gives an honest, frank, and inside look at the antiquated system that bands are faced with when they're attached to a major label." [...] Allan Tong of Filmmaker wrote that Leto [...] "does a fine job (with his editors) of weaving the lawsuit with interviews from rock journalists and former EMI executives." [...] Samantha Stott from The New Transmission felt that [...] "Artifact {{is one of the most}} honest pieces of work about the industry to have ever been made. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> credit to everyone involved and that shared their opinions, views and insights." ...|$|E
500|$|The Helicarriers in {{the film}} were {{completely}} digital. Earl said, [...] "In [...] {{it was more like}} an aircraft carrier, now it’s an aircraft carrier with the addition of battle ship-sized guns. We were all over the carriers [...] We were on the decks; we were flying next to them. We had a lot of close ups and different angles. And we didn’t just have one; we had three. On top of that, we had to destroy them all." [...] This CGI environment was also used in close ups. Earl said, [...] "The challenge was to get in all of the detail to make it feel like <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>real,</b> working ship. We created details down to the railings and all the human-scale stuff. ... For the shots in which we were destroying them, we had to have the internals as well – the hallways, the storage areas." [...] Many of the shots of Washington, D.C. were digitally created due to numerous flight restrictions in the city which necessitated that locations be recreated by computer. However, aerial footage of the city was filmed and used for live action plate photography for shots involving the Triskelion, which is located on Theodore Roosevelt Island on the Potomac River.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} well {{received}} by critics, both in its time period and in modern day. One reviewer said it ranked in cinema [...] "where Gertrude Stein ranks in poetry", while another praised Florey as [...] "the Eugene O'Neill of the cinema". A 1929 edition of Movie Makers, the official {{publication of the}} Amateur Cinema League, called it a triumph of amateur experimentation and imaginative use of limited resources. In a separate Movie Makers article, Herman G. Weinberg called the scenery [...] "a fantastically beautiful vision of a dream metropolis, done in the expressionistic manner, but done with a fine eye for the camera and {{the context of the}} piece". C. Adolph Glassgold, contributing editor for the journal The Arts, called it [...] "a truly tremendous picture" [...] and said Florey could become [...] "the eventual leader of cinematic art". He added: [...] "It has movement, tempo, form, intensity of feeling, highly dramatic moments; in short, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> motion picture." [...] In a Film Mercury review, Anabel Lane predicted Florey would [...] "one day hold a position of one of the bigger film directors", and said of the film: [...] "If this production had been made in Europe and heralded as a hit, it would... have been called a masterpiece." [...] One reviewer from Variety even speculated as to whether A Hollywood Extra was [...] "an unannounced foreign-made short" [...] given how similar in style it was to European art films. Film director Henry King praised the film as [...] "way ahead of its time" [...] and [...] "a stroke of genius", declaring: [...] "It was the most original thought I ever saw".|$|E

[...] Tancharoen called it [...] "the promise of something fairly ominous to come", and stated, [...] "We will be uncovering things from the midseason opener {{all the way to}} the finale. We will slowly be discovering what that image is." [...] She added that any [...] "clues" [...] would likely play out during present day sequences rather than further flash-forwards, such as when Johnson receives a vision of the flash-forward in [...] "Spacetime", an episode where she learns that [...] "she cannot change the outcome of these visions and the future is the future." [...] Whedon discussed this idea, and that of the [...] "theory behind the Inhumans that each one of them serves a purpose", saying, Inhumans [...] "are made, they're not random. There's a lack of something that needs filling and an Inhuman will be created that fills that niche. It's an interesting concept we like playing with, and that plays into the idea of fate, which with our future visions, we're hitting pretty hard." [...] On choosing Lincoln to be the one to die, which the executive producers knew going into the season when forming the arcs for Lincoln, Daisy, and Ward, Bell said he [...] "earned it" [...] adding that Lincoln comes to a point where he realizes what his purpose is, with Whedon noting that he understands that Daisy has a different purpose. Whedon continued that the decision was based on the fact that the series did not [...] "want to be a body count show, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> world with real stakes. What we had not done is the heroic death and the full-sacrifice death. This was a conscious decision. We also think that there’s a poetry in the fact that the person doing it doesn’t consider himself a hero.

2500|$|Like Kant and Bergson, Deleuze {{considers}} traditional {{notions of}} space and time as unifying forms imposed by the subject. He therefore concludes that pure difference is non-spatio-temporal; it is an idea, what Deleuze calls [...] "the virtual". (The coinage refers to Proust's definition of what is constant in both the past and the present: [...] "real without being actual, ideal without being abstract.") While Deleuze's virtual ideas superficially resemble Plato's forms and Kant's ideas of pure reason, they are not originals or models, nor do they transcend possible experience; instead they are the conditions of actual experience, the internal difference in itself. [...] "The concept they [...] form is identical to its object." [...] A Deleuzean idea or concept of difference is therefore not a wraith-like abstraction of an experienced thing, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> system of differential relations that creates actual spaces, times, and sensations.|$|E
