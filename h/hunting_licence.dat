40|$|Wild {{reindeer}} in Norway {{are found}} in 26 separate management areas. Predators are virtually absent from all areas and hunting {{is the most important}} factor determining population development through alterations of herd size and structure. Average population density (animals/km 2) after hunt was 1. 96 in Hardangervidda, 1. 18 in North Rondane and between 0. 78 and 0. 87 in Rondane South, Sn&oslash;hetta, North Ottadalen and Forelhogna. Body size and female pregnancy rates followed a reverse trend. Average net increase of the herds varied from 42. 2 &plusmn; 10. 0 % in Forelhogna to 18. 8 &plusmn; 8. 0 % in Rondane North. In areas with animals in prime physical condition a high versus a low average harvest rate of calves resulted in a similar number of animals harvested, but a lower total yield of meat and revenue from <b>hunting</b> <b>licences.</b> At a winter population density of 0. 8 - 2. 0 animals/km 2 annual harvest (per km 2) of wild reindeer amounts to 0. 23 - 0. 51 animals, 9 - 18 kg meat and 286 - 850 NKr from sale of <b>hunting</b> <b>licences.</b> There was a significant relationship between body size expressed as carcass weights or mandible length and harvest success...|$|R

50|$|In June, an angler in the Stump Field area {{discovered}} {{a pair of}} waders floating in the lake, and divers called to search the area then recovered from the lake bottom a lightweight hunting jacket and a flashlight: {{in one of the}} jacket pockets, there was a <b>hunting</b> <b>licence</b> with Williams' name and signature.

50|$|Collection Galla: this {{collection}} was given {{as a gift}} by the lawyer Mariano Galla in 2007. It {{is made up of}} about 400 works - volumes and periodicals- about hunting that were published between the twentieth and the twenty-first century. You can find many books which describe the capture techniques of the game. There are hunting tales and diaries, precious illustrated books on birds (in particular on woodcocks), some manuals telling what to do to obtain the <b>hunting</b> <b>licence</b> and several encyclopedias. Del modo di piantare e custodire una ragnaja e di uccellare a ragna (1790) is the oldest work of the collection. This work was wrongly attributed to Bernardo Davanzati and was often published in his Opera Omnia. In reality this book was by G.A.

30|$|As {{mentioned}} above, farmers view bears {{as being}} less problematic than wolves. This is mainly {{because not all}} bear individuals cause problems. One example was given by a farmer who told me how a bear sow has lived for years within her forest pasturing area without ever causing any problems. Every year the farmer fears that what she calls 'her' bear will be shot in the annual bear hunt (unlike wolf <b>hunts,</b> <b>licences</b> for bear <b>hunts</b> are issued yearly as their numbers are {{not considered to be}} threatened), and that a new, more aggressive bear will settle in her territory instead. Other farmers have had major problems with frequent bear attacks, especially but not exclusively on sheep, and are more negative about the possibility of combining free-range pasturing with bear presence.|$|R
50|$|Inhabitants of the {{surrounding}} municipalities, {{so long as they}} are part of the Markgenossenschaft, have the right to fell timber in the Markwald, to leave their cattle to graze in the forest (e.g. droving or pannage) and so on.

They have the right of co-determination and the type of management to be carried out, is jointly agreed, on the advice of the forester responsible, at their annual general meetings. They can, for example, decide if and where plantations are established and whether wind generators may be built within the forest area. They also benefit for example if the income from timber sales or <b>hunting</b> <b>licences</b> exceeds the expenditure.|$|R

40|$|This thesis investigates how {{conflicts}} of interest among local hunting interests affect {{the legitimacy of the}} Swedish government's goals on hunting. These goals aim to give non-landowning and small landowning hunters an opportunity to hunt more and bigger game, as well as improving game management. A case-study was carried out in the county of Norrbotten among its Game Management Associations (GMAs) in 2004 to determine which kinds of {{conflicts of}} interest existed there. This association is part of hunting policy, since it was empowered and proliferated {{in the beginning of the}} 1980 s to implement the formal rules in the Game Management Association Act (1980). It is assumed to be representative of local hunting in general. Lingering informal rules have been found to govern hunting locally in Norr-botten and show no sign of weakening. Thus, {{conflicts of interest}}, especially majority-minority conflicts between landowners and renthunters become permanent. Small game hunting and the issuing of hunting permits are, in particular, governed by informal rules, while the suspension of hunters is often the result of the arbitrary use of formal rules. These two issues involve mostly renthunters. Even the content of formal rules in policy can also cause conflict in GMAs. For instance, the 33 § in the Game Management Association Act has become legally and ideologically controversial, since it makes it difficult for landowners to remove their properties from GMAs, and, thus, from a European legal perspective, encroaches on both their property rights and exercise of individual rights. The thesis also reveals that administrative contexts and structural attributes influence conflicts of interest in GMAs. For instance, small game hunters in moose management areas are in conflict with their boards to a greater extent than their counterparts in <b>hunting</b> <b>licence</b> areas. The size of a GMA and the presence of non-local hunters are also factors that influence conflicts of interest in GMAs. Hunting policy has met resistance from local informal rules and the remnants of old policy rules, so-called ‘ghost policies'. For example, less than half of appealed GMAs between 1981 and 2003 used formal rules when making decisions. Thus, the goals concerning increasing the number of hunting opportunities in Sweden have not yet been fulfilled. Neither has game management improved. Ironically, this is caused by the presence of non- landowning non-local hunters, the very group of hunters the government's goals on hunting focus on. Nevertheless, small landowning hunters are satisfied with the amount of game they can hunt in the GMA. Godkänd; 2006; 20061205 (haneit...|$|E

50|$|Greater scaup are {{a popular}} game bird in North America and Europe. They are hunted in Denmark, Germany, Greece, France, the United Kingdom, and Ireland, and in Iran for both sport and {{commercial}} reasons. Greater scaup are hunted with shotguns because {{they must be}} shot on the fly, a challenging task, as they can fly at up to 121 km/h. Greater scaup are hunted from shorelines and in open water hunting blinds or layout boats, low-profile kayak-like boats that hunters lie inside. Hunters frequently use decoys to attract the birds, often arranged to simulate a raft of greater scaup and featuring an open area to attract the birds to land. In most countries where greater scaup are hunted, a duck stamp is required along with the normal <b>hunting</b> <b>licences</b> that are required to pursue other game. In America and Canada, waterfowl must be hunted with non-toxic shot.|$|R
30|$|All {{political}} parties in the Norwegian parliament (Stortinget) settled on the Carnivore Agreement in 2011. It emphasizes biological and ecological knowledge as a major foundation for carnivore governance {{in order to obtain}} desired population estimates. The document decides upon sustainable size of population for each species. A main objective with this agreement is to reduce the level of conflict between the different interests by strengthening the capacity and competence of the agencies dealing with carnivore management around (1) reporting and registration of carnivores and (2) preventive actions through the Regional Carnivore Committees and local hunting teams. The document also clarifies regulations around <b>hunting</b> <b>licences</b> and population goals for the different carnivores. It states that local actors, particularly actors from the pastoral sectors, should be involved in population registration and should also be represented in local hunting teams. Furthermore, it emphasizes that knowledge of carnivores’ behaviour and habitats is to be communicated to the local communities (Parliament’s Document Nr. 8 : 163 S (2010 – 2011)).|$|R

5|$|After Mzilikazi died in 1868, his son Lobengula {{replaced}} him in 1870, following a brief succession struggle. Tall and well built, Lobengula was generally considered thoughtful and sensible, even by contemporary Western accounts; {{according to the}} South African big-game hunter Frederick Hugh Barber, who met him in 1875, he was witty, mentally sharp and authoritative—"every inch a king". Based at his royal kraal at Bulawayo, Lobengula was at first open to Western enterprises in his country, adopting Western-style clothing and granting mining concessions and <b>hunting</b> <b>licences</b> to white visitors in return for pounds sterling, weapons and ammunition. Because of the king's illiteracy, these documents were prepared in English or Dutch by whites who took up residence at his kraal; to ascertain that what was written genuinely reflected what he had said, Lobengula would have his words translated and transcribed {{by one of the}} whites, then later translated back by another. Once the king was satisfied of the written translation's veracity, he would sign his mark, affix the royal seal (which depicted an elephant), and then have the document signed and witnessed by a number of white men, at least one of whom would also write an endorsement of the proclamation.|$|R
25|$|Currently, 28 of the U.S. {{states have}} black bear hunting seasons. Nineteen states require a bear hunting license, with some also {{requiring}} {{a big game}} license. In eight states, only a big game license is required to hunt black bears. Overall, over 481,500 black bear <b>hunting</b> <b>licences</b> are sold per year. The hunting methods and seasons vary greatly according to state, with some bear hunting seasons including fall only, spring and fall, or year-round. New Jersey, in November 2010, approved a six-day bear-hunting season in early December 2010 to slow {{the growth of the}} black bear population. Bear-hunting had been banned in New Jersey for five years. A Fairleigh Dickinson University PublicMind poll found that 53% of New Jersey voters approved of the new season if scientists concluded black bears were leaving their usual habitats and destroying private property. Men, older voters, and those living in rural areas were more likely to approve of a bear-hunting season in New Jersey than women, younger voters, and those living in more developed parts of the state. In the western states, where there are large black populations, there are spring and year-round seasons. Approximately 18,000 black bears were killed annually in the USA between 1988 and 1992. Within this period, annual kills ranged from six bears in South Carolina to 2,232 in Maine.|$|R
