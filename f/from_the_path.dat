5|$|Throughout March 2012, Architects and Touché Amoré {{supported}} Rise Against {{on their}} European tour. Hillier-Brook's last tour with Architects was the April 2012 British tour with Rolo Tomassi and Stray <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Path.</b> Between March and June that yearthe {{last few months}} before the large tours in support of DaybreakerArchitects performed at several festivals; the Swedish Konzerthaus Schüür in Lucerne, the La Boule Noire near Paris, Groezrock Festival in Belgium, British touring festival Slam Dunk Festival in Leeds and Hatfield, and German festivals Summerblast Festival, Traffic Jam Festival and Summerbreeze Festival. Because Hillier-Brook had announced he would leave Architects on 16 April 2012 after his final performance with the band at Groezrock Festival, Josh Middleton of Sylosis joined the band as touring guitarist. In late April, Architects supported The Devil Wears Prada and Whitechapel on a six-day tour of South America.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, E.V. Ramasamy's chief lieutenant, Conjeevaram Natarajan Annadurai, {{established}} a separate association called the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), or Dravidian Progressive Federation. This {{was due to}} differences between the two, while Periyar advocated a separate independent Dravidian or Tamil state, Annadurai compromised with the Delhi government, {{at the same time}} claiming increased state independence. E.V. Ramasamy was convinced that individuals and movements that undertake the task of eradicating the social evils in the Indian sub-continent have to pursue the goal with devotion and dedication without deviating <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> and with uncompromising zeal. Thus, if they contest elections aiming to assume political power, they would lose vigour and sense of purpose. But among his followers, there were those who had a different view, wanting to enter into politics and have a share in running the government. They were looking for an opportunity to part with E.V. Ramasamy. Thus, when E.V. Ramasamy married Maniammai on 9 July 1948, they quit the Dravidar Kazhagam, stating that E.V. Ramasamy married maniammayar who was daughter of kanagasabhai when he was 70 and she 32. Those who parted company with E.V. Ramasamy joined the DMK. Though the DMK split from the Dravidar Kazhagam, the organisation made efforts to carry on E.V. Ramasamy's Self-Respect Movement to villagers and urban students. The DMK advocated the thesis that the Tamil language was much richer than Sanskrit and Hindi in content, and thus was a key which opened the door to subjects to be learned. The Dravidar Kazhagam continued to counter Brahminism, Indo-Aryan propaganda, and uphold the Dravidians' right of self-determination.|$|E
5|$|San Martín {{moved the}} {{regiment}} from Retiro to Rosario, nearing {{the river at}} San Pedro and San Nicolás. He was following the Spanish ships and moved at night to avoid detection. San Martín had one hundred and twenty men for this action, reinforced at Rosario by a militia of seventy men {{under the command of}} Celedonio Escalada. Those reinforcements included twenty two rifleman, thirty cavalry, a small cannon and men armed with knives. Escalada had made other actions against the royalists before this battle. San Martín discovered that the royalists intended to pillage the San Carlos Convent and pressed the march to arrive there first. A hundred royalists landed on San Lorenzo, but the only food available to them was some chickens and watermelons. Aware of the risk of pillage, the population had removed the cattle from the area before the royalists arrived. Escalada arrived in San Lorenzo before the bulk of the patriot army, but the dust trail <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> to Rosario revealed their presence. Escalada attacked them but their ship had a longer range than his cannon, keeping him at bay. He was forced to retire when he found a Paraguayan prisoner who had escaped from the ship. The Paraguayan disclosed the size of the royalist army and their plan of attacking the convent with a larger force, suspecting that the local money was kept in it. They did not attack the convent right away, requiring time to prepare the two field cannons. Escalada returned with San Martin and relayed the news. The march from Retiro to the convent took only five days, thanks to the cadet Ángel Pacheco. Pacheco moved ahead of the regiment and prepared horses in advance at the relay positions. The whole army arrived on scene during the night of 2 February and hid inside the convent. They entered through the rear door and were not allowed to light fires or speak during the night. San Martín studied the enemy and the battlefield from the convent's tower, using a monocular.|$|E

25|$|Erdington {{developed}} as a village {{as a result of}} settlers travelling up the course of the River Tame from Tamworth in the 9th century.

25|$|If {{the folding}} {{deformation}} cannot be accommodated by flexural slip or volume-change shortening (buckling), the rocks are generally removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> of the stress. This {{is achieved by}} pressure dissolution, a form of metamorphic process, in which rocks shorten by dissolving constituents in areas of high strain and redepositing them in areas of lower strain. Folds created in this way include examples in migmatites, and areas with a strong axial planar cleavage.|$|E

25|$|The eye has acuity {{limits for}} {{detecting}} motion. Forward motion {{is limited by}} the subtended angular velocity detection threshold (SAVT), and horizontal and vertical motion acuity are limited by lateral motion thresholds. The lateral motion limit is generally below the looming motion limit, and for an object of a given size, lateral motion becomes the more insightful of the two, once the observer moves sufficiently far away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> of travel. Below these thresholds subjective constancy is experienced in accordance with the Stevens' power law and Weber–Fechner law.|$|E
25|$|Brunel, a heavy smoker, who {{had been}} {{diagnosed}} with Bright's disease (nephritis), suffered a stroke in September 1859, just before the Great Eastern made her first voyage to New York. He died ten days later at the age of 53 and was buried, like his father, in Kensal Green Cemetery in London. The grave is insignificant {{by the standards of the}} cemetery and easily missed.

25|$|The Cure, Jane's Addiction, Radiohead, Joy Division, Muse, PiL and The Smashing Pumpkins are {{considered}} to be the underlying influences of The Abyss' musical style.

25|$|Pavey Ark {{can also}} be ascended from Stickle Tarn via Easy Gully, North Rake or by the path to Harrison Stickle. Easy Gully is a steep walk on scree between the crags at {{the eastern end of}} the precipice, {{starting}} from the same place as Jack's Rake, and is blocked by large boulders near the top, where tough scrambling is required. North Rake (so named by Wainwright) starts <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> to High Raise at the very eastern end of the cliff and rises west {{over the top of the}} East Buttress. This is a much less exposed and strenuous walking route to the summit.|$|E
25|$|Little {{remains of}} the castle {{features}} except the waist-high battlements, that served little more than lookout {{to the city of}} Angra. A double staircase connects the main platform <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> leading to the Gardens. Gardened and manicured, the spaces below the old castle are lined by endemic and flowering plants. Apart from the monument to D. Pedro IV, the only remnant to the fortifications use is an azulejo tile dedicated to the Fort of São Luís located in the staircase. Remnants of the ravine canalization and mills are evident in the roads that lead from the park grounds, including along the Rua do Pisão, Rua do Garoupinha and Rua de Santo Espírito.|$|E
25|$|While rescue {{efforts were}} {{underway}} {{to look for}} people under the destroyed structures, few were aware that another violent tornado would strike the area.

Tanner was the first community to be hit, and many structures that were left standing after the first tornado were destroyed in the second one. A man injured at Lawson's Trailer Park in the first tornado was taken to a church in the area, which collapsed in the second tornado, killing him.|$|E
