40|$|Abstract—To {{maximise}} furnace production it’s {{necessary to}} optimise furnace control, with {{the objectives of}} achieving maximum power input into the melting process, minimum network distortion and power-off time, without compromise on quality and safety. This can be achieved with {{on the one hand}} by an appropriate electrode control {{and on the other hand}} by a minimum of AC transformer switching. Electrical arc is a stochastic process; witch is the principal cause of power quality problems, including voltages dips, harmonic distortion, unbalance loads and flicker. So it is difficult to make an appropriate model for an Electrical Arc Furnace (EAF). The factors that effect EAF operation are the melting or refining materials, melting stage, electrode position (arc length), <b>electrode</b> <b>arm</b> control and short circuit power of the feeder. So arc voltages, current and power are defined as a nonlinear function of the arc length. In this article we propose our own empirical function of the EAF and model, for the mean stages of the melting process, thanks to the measurements in the steel factory.

40|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} {{has been}} increasingly used by research groups to enhance and increase maturation of cells in an engineered cardiac tissue (ECT). Current methods {{are based on}} using off-the-shelf wires or electrodes to deliver a stimulus voltage to the in-vitro tissue in culture medium. A major issue with this approach is the generation of byproducts in the medium due to the voltage levels required, which are typically {{in the range of}} 5 V- 10 V. No solution currently exists that can accomplish electrical stimulation of cells in an ECT at a low voltage level. Therefore, in this study a novel, porous, thinfilm, microelectrode array (PMEA) device is proposed. The primary advantage of this device is the ability to successfully function at a very low voltage thus minimizing any undesirable oxidative byproducts in the culture environment or cell injury. This was achieved by designing and fabricating a thin device capable of being embedded in the ECT to deliver voltage. The P-MEA device is essentially a thin-film cable i. e. a conducting wire encapsulated with an insulating material; in this case thin-film gold electrodes sandwiched between two layers of insulating polyimide. Major features of the P-MEA include overall dimensions of 10 mm width and 82 mm length, four arms to allow movement of the individual sensor pads within ECTs, each embedded <b>electrode</b> <b>arm</b> incorporates eight 100 μm x 200 μm rectangular pores surrounding a 950 μm x 340 μm exposed electrode, large pads {{on either side of the}} porous embedded sensor to function as return electrodes, suture holes to aid in-vivo suturing and stabilization and eight electrode connector pads. Average thickness of the device was 16 μm, with an average electrode film thickness of 0. 4 μm. Electrode resistance ranged from 69. 45 Ω to 78. 52 Ω. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was performed on the P-MEA electrodes and it confirmed that the P-MEA successfully operates in the 0. 01 V to 1. 0 V range with favorable charge transfer characteristics. Proof of principle experiments confirmed the ability of the PMEA to effectively embed within the ECT and electrically stimulate it during chronic, in-vitro culture. Histology imaging shows that the embedding of the device has no adverse effects on the ECT and the cardiomyocytes are aligned within the tissue. Experiments are ongoing to evaluate the role of electrical stimulation on the maturation and function of ECTs which are made of stem cells and other sources. In summary, this device is capable of safe low-voltage electrical stimulation of engineered cardiac tissues (ECTs); it has been designed, fabricated, and its ability to function as a low-voltage stimulus device has been validated using electrochemical tests and in-vitro culture experiments. The design and fabrication of the device went through three major iterations. A final manufacturing process was refined and successfully transferred to the UofL MNTC staff for subsequent manufacturing...|$|E
40|$|Crystal structure, {{morphology}} and crystallization kinetics of melt-crystallized polypropylene and poly(propylene-stat-ethylene) fractions with 2. 7 to 11. 0 mol% of ethylene {{were studied}} by differential scanning calorimeter, wide- and small-angle X-ray scattering, polarized light microscopy, {{transmission electron microscopy}} and infrared spectroscopy. With increasing ethylene content the poly(propylene-stat-ethylene) fractions showed unchanged crystallinity, increased unit cell volume and constant crystal thickness in combination with a shortened helix length. This indicated that a fraction of ethylene defects were incorporated into the crystal structure. During the isothermal crystallization both α- and γ-crystals could be formed. The γ-crystal fraction increased with increasing ethylene content and increasing crystallization temperature. For samples with α- and γ-crystal contents, multimodal melting was observed and a noticeable γ- to α-crystal conversion was observed on slow heating. The spherulitic structure of the copolymers was coarser than that for the homopolymer. The crystalline lamellae in copolymers exhibited profound curvature {{in contrast to the}} straighter cross-hatched α-crystals typical to the homopolymer. Area dependence of electrical breakdown strength was studied for thin polypropylene homopolymer films. The measurements were performed with an automatic measurement system equipped with a scanning <b>electrode</b> <b>arm.</b> Five different electrodes having areas between 0. 045 cm 2 and 9. 3 cm 2 were used and typically 40 - 80 breakdowns per sample and electrode area were collected. All measurements were performed on dry samples in air at room temperature. The data was analyzed statistically and the Weibull function parameters α and β, the first one related to 63 % probability for the sample to break down and the second one to the width of the distribution were fitted to the obtained data. Different features concerning the measurement system and conditions, e. g. criteria for the automatic detection of the breakdowns, effect of electrode edge design, partial discharges, DC ramp speed and humidity were critically analyzed. It was concluded that the obtained α-parameter values were stable and repeatable over several years of time. The β-parameter values, however, varied ± 10 - 30 %, more for the large than the small electrodes, and were also sensitive to the changes both in the sample itself and in the measurement conditions. Breakdown strengths of over 50 capacitor grade polypropylene films were analyzed. The obtained α-parameter values were between 450 and 850 V/μm, depending on the film grade and electrode area. In addition to the high breakdown strengths, reflected by the obtained α-values, another, sparse distribution consisting of low breakdown strengths was revealed when the amount of measurement points was high enough. This means that more than one Weibull distribution could be needed to describe the breakdown strength behavior of a polypropylene film. Breakdown values showed decreasing area dependence with decreasing electrode area. Breakdown strengths for larger sample areas were predicted from the small area data by area- and Weibull extrapolation. The area extrapolation led to predicted α-values 50 % higher than measured at 4 m 2 whereas the Weibull extrapolation showed an accuracy of ± 15 % when predicted and measured values were compared. Breakdown strengths were also extrapolated for film areas similar to those in impregnated power capacitors. It turned out that the power capacitors, tested at the factory, performed much better than predicted by the extrapolation. However, a few weak spots with very low breakdown values were also found. For the poly(ethyelene terephtalate) dielectric, which is not swelled by the impregnation liquid, the large area breakdown strength was predictable. This indicates that for polypropylene film processing and impregnation led, in addition to the improved large area breakdown performance, also to sparse weak spots with low breakdown probabilities. Different Weibull distributions were responsible for the breakdown strengths for the processed and impregnated polypropylene than for the dry film samples. QC 2010102...|$|E

40|$|Epaxial muscle {{activity}} during prey strike {{was measured in}} two discrete myomeric regions of the largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides to test whether (1) the extreme dorsal region of the epaxial muscle (the epaxial arm region) plays {{a larger role in}} prey strike than the region bordering the main horizontal septum (the epaxial cone region), (2) whether the epaxial arm region is more active anteriorly than posteriorly during prey strike and (3) whether the epaxial arm region activity is correlated with the epaxial cone region activity. Electromyographic recordings (EMGs) of four bass were taken from eight different longitudinal, epaxial muscle sites: five sites in the arm region and three sites in the cone region. Selection of electrode sites was based on epaxial muscle dissections in which a set of previously undefined tendons, neurocranial-epineural-epaxial connector tendons, were described. Every strike had some activity in the arm region, while 48 % {{of the total number of}} prey strikes had zero cone activity, Muscle activity was recorded consistently from the first four anterior <b>electrodes</b> in the <b>arm</b> region of each fish, while the posteriormost <b>arm</b> <b>electrodes</b> showed varying degrees of activity.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a method for}} a broadband absorption enhancement in the LWIR range (8 - 12 μm), in single layer microbolometer pixels with 35 μm pitch. For {{the first time in}} the literature, this study {{introduces a}} very simple and low cost approach to enhance the absorption by embedding plasmonic structures at the same level as the already existing metallic layer of a microbolometer pixel. The metal layer comprises the <b>electrode</b> and the <b>arm</b> structures on the body. Even though the periodicity of the plasmonic structures is slightly disturbed by the placement of the electrodes and the connecting metal, the metal <b>arms</b> and the <b>electrodes</b> compensate for the lack of the periodicity contributing to the resonance by their coupling with the individual plasmonic resonators. Various plasmonic structures are designed with FDTD simulations. Individual, plasmonically modified microbolometer pixels are fabricated, and an increase in the average absorption due to surface plasmon excitation at Au/Si 3 N 4 interfaces is observed. Plasmonic structures increase the average absorption from 78 % to 82 % and result in an overall enhancement of 5. 1 %. A good agreement between the simulation and the FTIR measurement results are obtained within the LWIR range.

40|$|The {{detection}} of movement-related {{components of the}} brain activity is useful {{in the design of}} brain machine interfaces. A common approach is to classify the brain activity into a number of templates or states. To find these templates, the neural responses are averaged over each movement task. For averaging to be effective, one must assume that the neural components occur at identical times over repeated trials. However, complex arm movements such as reaching and grasping are prone to cross-trial variability due to the way movements are performed. Typically initiation time, duration of movement and movement speed are variable even as a subject tries to reproduce the same task identically across trials. Therefore, movement-related neural activity will tend to occur at different times across each trial. Due to this mismatch, the averaging of neural activity will not bring into salience movement-related components. To address this problem, we present a method of alignment that accounts for the variabilities in the way the movements are conducted. In this study, arm speed was used to align neural activity. Four subjects had electrocorticographic (ECoG) electrodes implanted over their primary motor cortex and were asked to perform reaching and retrieving tasks using the upper limb contralateral to the site of <b>electrode</b> implantation. The <b>arm</b> speeds were aligned using a nonlinear transformation of the temporal axes resulting in averaged spectrograms with superior visualization of movement-related neural activity when compared to averaging without alignment...|$|R

Training of deep abdominal muscles in isolation from the other trunk muscles, as an initial phase of training, {{has been shown to}} improve the timing of activation of the trained muscles, and reduce symptoms and recurrence of LBP. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine if training of the trunk muscles in a non-isolated manner can restore motor control of these muscles in people with LBP. Ten subjects with non-specific LBP performed a single session of training that involved three tasks: “abdominal curl up”, “side bridge” and “birdog”. Electromyographic activity (EMG) of trunk and deltoid muscles was recorded with fine-wire and surface <b>electrodes</b> during rapid <b>arm</b> movements and walking, before and immediately following the intervention. Onset of trunk muscle EMG relative to that of the prime mover (deltoid) during arm movements and the mean, standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation of abdominal muscle EMG during walking were calculated. There was no significant change in the times of onset of trunk muscle EMG during arm movements nor was there any change in the variability of EMG of the abdominal muscles during walking. However, the mean amplitude and SD of abdominal EMG was reduced during walking after training. The results of this study suggest that unlike isolated voluntary training, co-contraction training of the trunk muscles does not restore the motor control of the deep abdominal muscles in people with LBP after a single session of training.

Electrodes were placed on the chin and the dorsal surface of the right forearm and leads taken to an electromyograph which recorded by "pen" on Teledeltos paper. The chin electrodes gave an indication of the moment of speaking and the <b>arm</b> <b>electrodes</b> a measure of tension in the forearm. It was thus possible to correlate the speed of work, indicated by the distance between clusters of spikes on the chin record, and the level of muscular tension, indicated by the mean height of the waveform from the forearm during the period between the verbalizations. In this way variations in output and tension could be followed during the course of work. It was found that a high negative correlation occurred between speed and tension under all three conditions. Starting and end spurts occurred over short time intervals in all sums in both time and tension curves. The longer sums led to slower work and tended to lead to more tension. These results can be interpreted to support the hypothesis that tension facilitates work of this kind, a suggestion which is reinforced by the results from the induced tension conditions. Subjects worked more quickly under P conditions and became more tense under M conditions. Large individual differences were noted but not examined in detail. The ways in which tension may facilitate mental processes and the relevance of this work to the peripheral theory of thought are briefly discussed. <p...|$|R
40|$|Researchers at NASA s Johnson Space Center and at Orbital Research, Inc. (a NASA SBIR grant recipient) have {{recently}} developed a dry-electrode harness {{that allows for}} self-acquisition of resting 12 -lead ECGs by minimally trained laypersons. When {{used in conjunction with}} commercial wireless (e. g., Bluetooth(TM) or 802. 11 -enabled) 12 -lead ECG devices and custom smart phone-based software, the collected 12 -lead ECG data can also immediately be forwarded from any geographic location within cellular range to the user s physician(s) of choice. The system {{can also be used to}} immediately forward to central receiving stations 12 -lead ECG data collected during space flight or during activities in any remote terrestrial location supported by an internet or cellular phone infrastructure. The main novel aspects of the system are first, the dry-electrode 12 -lead ECG harness itself, and second, an accompanying Android(TM) smart phone-based wireless 12 -lead ECG capability. The ECG harness nominally employs dry electrodes manufactured by Orbital Research, Inc, recently cleared through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, other dry electrodes that are not yet FDA cleared, for example those recently developed by Nanosonic, Inc as part of another NASA SBIR grant, can also be used. The various advantageous features of the harness include: 1) laypersons can be quickly instructed on its correct use, remotely if necessary; 2) all tangled "leadwire spaghetti" is eliminated, as is the common clinical problem of "leadwire reversal"; 3) all adhesives and disposables are also eliminated, the harness being fully reusable; if multiple individuals intend to use use the same harness, then standard antimicrobial wipes can be employed to sterilize the dry electrodes (and harness surface if needed) between users; 5) padded cushions at the lateral sides of the torso function to press the left arm (LA) and right <b>arm</b> (RA) dry <b>electrodes</b> mounted on the cushions against sideward or downward-rested arms of the subject; 6) sufficient distal placement of the <b>arm</b> <b>electrodes</b> achieves good electrode abutment to the arms without the need for adhesives, straps, bands, bracelets, or gloves; 7) padding over the sternum avoids "tenting" in the V 1 through V 3 (and, when present, the V 3 R) electrode positions; 8) easy-to-don, one-piece design with an adjustable, front-side single point of connection and an adjustable shoulder strap; and 9) Lund or "modified Lund" placement of the dry electrodes, the results of which more effectively reproduce results from "standard" 12 -lead ECG placements than do results from Mason-Likar placements. The main limitation of the harness is that "one size does not fit all", meaning that an appropriately sized harness (small, medium, large, etc) must be chosen on the basis of an individual's size. To facilitate the use of the harness with inexpensive, commodity-grade cell phones and tablet devices, 12 -lead ECG software is also being developed to accompany the harness for wireless use with Android. For this part of the project, NASA has teamed with TopCoder, Inc and the Harvard-affiliated NASA Tournament Lab in sponsoring java-based software programming contests through TopCoder. While ECG signals from the harness can already be wirelessly received and thoroughly processed (locally or remotely) by commercial-grade conventional (as well as advanced) 12 -lead ECG software running on Microsoft Windows(TM), the Android-based software, once completed, will "cast a wider net" by allowing for a greater percentage of cell phone owners to participate in inexpensive, store-and-forward recordings of 12 -lead ECGs worldwide, including for example Android cell phone users in many remote, third-world locations. At the time of writing, the Android 12 -lead ECG software platform consists of a basic but expanding graphical user interface and accompanying software that: 1) wirelessly receives the 12 -lead ECG data stream from a Bluetooth-based, FDA-cleared 12 -leaCG device attached to the harness; 2) locally stores the same data in binary format to the SD card on the Android cell phone; and 3) makes the data stream in available in real time, for now to TopCoder's java programming contestants...|$|R
