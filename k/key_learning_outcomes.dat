The Supervisory Relationship emerged as a single overarching theme that contained and contextualized three further themes: Promoting Learning, Dimensions of Power, and The Self of the Supervisor. One theme is reported here, Promoting Learning, with an illustrative example of experiential learning in a student that demonstrates the overriding significance of The Supervisory Relationship. The findings are discussed in the context of current literature and research regarding supervision and training.

40|$|This paper serves three purposes. First, {{it makes}} a case for seeing {{creativity}} as a <b>key</b> <b>learning</b> <b>outcome</b> in our times, and thus the core business of education.

Finally and most importantly, the paper argues the value of a pedagogical approach the author calls “Meddling-in-the-Middle”, in augmenting and enhancing the repertoires of “Sage-on-the-Stage” and “Guide-on-the-Side” in order to build students' creative capacity. Examples are given of what these meta-approaches might look like in relation to the teaching of Shakespeare.

However, when there is a requirement for such learning to be practice‐based it is not always possible to provide students with the necessary resources for independent study. This paper describes the development and evaluation of a Web‐based tool that allows students to practise and test their human movement analysis skills independently, at their own pace.

40|$|Objective {{training}} in technical wine evaluation {{is a critical}} component of wine education and the ability to recognise and describe wine sensory attributes using formal descriptive language is a <b>key</b> <b>learning</b> <b>outcome</b> for viticulture/oenology and wine business students alike. Wine evaluation is taught and assessed during formal sensory practicals, however, a significant proportion of studentsâ€™ tasting experience occurs outside the classroom, and thus, is never evaluated. Furthermore, diversity in the backgrounds and life experiences of students studying wine-related courses also presents several unique learning and teaching challenges; with significant differences observed between domestic and international studentsâ€™ participation in and perceptions of wine sensory evaluation. This paper describes the development and evaluation of My Wine World, an iPad application designed specifically for technical wine assessment.

In a study comprised of 53 participants, we studied learning effectiveness and satisfaction. Presence and flow increased satisfaction, while interaction increased learning effectiveness.

40|$|This thesis {{contains}} multiple-case {{studies of}} how critical thinking was conceptualised and operationalised by five academics from different disciplines {{in a university}} in Hong Kong. In response to the current literature that is characterised by prevalent dependence on academics’ self-reports to investigate perceptions and pedagogical practice for promoting critical thinking, the data in this research were obtained through non-participant observations, semi-structured interviews, and document collection. Using a framework underpinned by Argyris and Schön’s (1974) theory of action as well as Lave and Wenger’s (1991) notion of situated activity, the espoused beliefs and actual practice of case participants were analysed inductively through the constant comparison method. The findings contribute to a model of pedagogical engagement with critical thinking that elucidates the relationship between academics’ conceptions and practice. Pedagogy that encourages thinking development {{can be understood as}} engagement with critical thinking in three forms, namely, critical thinking as integral, critical thinking as incidental, and critical thinking as instrumental. These forms of engagement are associated with three factors, which are dimensions of academics’ implicit theories: expectations of students, the perceived relevance of critical thinking, and knowledge of critical thinking. The model of pedagogical engagement advances the argument that instruction for critical thinking development is individual academics’ personal constructions that are constantly negotiated between their latent beliefs and awareness of context. The thesis concludes with implications for policy planners, practitioners, and researchers, offering suggestions towards promoting critical thinking both as a <b>key</b> <b>learning</b> <b>outcome</b> in universities and the hallmark of higher education. published_or_final_versionEducationDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
