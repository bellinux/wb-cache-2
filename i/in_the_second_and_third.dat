5|$|Theologian and philosopher Anselm of Canterbury (1033–1109) {{proposed}} an ontological argument <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>and</b> <b>third</b> chapters of his Proslogion.

5|$|Nevertheless, Hamence {{was picked}} to play <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>and</b> <b>Third</b> Tests against the touring Indian cricket team in Australia in 194748. He made 25 {{in the first}} innings of both matches, with the first, {{starting}} 12 December 1947, ended in a draw before Hamence could bat again. In the Third Test, which started on 1 January 1948, Australia achieved victory with centuries from Don Bradman and Arthur Morris meaning Hamence was again not needed to bat in the second innings. He was then replaced by Neil Harvey for the final two Tests.|$|E

The most common congenital abnormalities associated with warfarin use in late pregnancy are central nervous system disorders, including spasticity and seizures, and eye defects. Because of such later pregnancy birth defects, anticoagulation with warfarin poses a problem in pregnant women requiring warfarin for vital indications, such as stroke prevention in those with artificial heart valves.|$|E

Ottawa received another penalty {{less than a minute}} later, which sent Todd Simpson to the penalty box for holding. A Flyers penalty against Radovan Somik for slashing Martin Havlat resulted in a power play goal for the Senators' Zdeno Chara, closing the score to a two-goal gap once again. Fisher subsequently received his second penalty of the game, for high-sticking.|$|E

5|$|Controversy has {{continued}} {{in recent years}} with the demolition of the 1930s Churchill House, a neo-Georgian municipal building originally housing the Electricity Board, {{to make way for}} the new Bath Bus Station. This was part of the Southgate redevelopment begun in 2007 in which the central 1960s shopping precinct, bus station, and multi-story carpark were demolished and replaced with a new area of mock-Georgian shopping streets. As a result of the changes the city's status as a World Heritage Site was reviewed by UNESCO in 2009. The decision was made to let Bath keep its status, but UNESCO has asked to be consulted on future phases of the Riverside development, saying that the density and volume of buildings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>and</b> <b>third</b> phases of the development need to be reconsidered. It also says that Bath must do more to attract world-class architecture to any new developments.|$|E

In the final act, Ruth's death and revival is revealed to be a dream John was having.

5|$|The Bulldogs {{opened the}} 1920 season against the Pitcairn Quakers.

The Bulldogs were only forced to punt once in the game, and did not attempt to score <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>and</b> <b>third</b> quarters because of the large lead. In the fourth quarter, however, end Bunny Corcoran caught a 35-yard touchdown pass from Guyon, and back Ike Martin ran for a one-yard touchdown.

Kris' children Kendall and Kylie from her subsequent marriage to American athlete Bruce (later Caitlyn) Jenner have also been featured on the show since its beginning, along with Jenner's son Brody from another marriage, although he appeared very few times during the early seasons, mostly being called by his step-brother Rob to babysit their half-sisters Kylie and Kendall. Kourtney's boyfriend Scott Disick has also been appearing frequently on the show since the first season, {{as well as on}} the show's spin-offs.

5|$|The {{two teams}} were {{competing}} for promotion {{to the third}} tier of the English football league system, at the time called the Second Division, a familiar place for both sides.

While Darlington had featured in the second tier just twice, competing in the third tier on 32 occasions and the fourth tier another 32 times. The official attendance of 43,431 was a record for a play-off final at that level, beating the previous record set in 1994, until it was bettered a year later by 3,373 spectators. There was also a significant disparity {{in the number of}} tickets sold to the supporters of the two clubs, with fewer than 10,000 Darlington fans in attendance compared to 35,000 fans representing Plymouth Argyle.|$|E

5|$|About a {{third to}} a half of {{individuals}} with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs. Differences in communication may be present from {{the first year of}} life, and may include delayed onset of babbling, unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>and</b> <b>third</b> years, children with autism have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences, {{and are more likely to}} simply repeat others' words (echolalia) or reverse pronouns. Joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD: for example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object, and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience. Children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{withering}} fire, Klenau's force reached Essling's edge, {{where his}} men set up 64 artillery pieces and bombarded the French {{for nearly an}} hour. Taking the village by storm, Austrian cavalry poured into the village from the north, and the French were pushed out in a methodical advance. Klenau's batteries were able to fire on the French-held bridges south of the village, over which the French had to retreat. In bitter house-to-house fighting, the Austrians entered the village. Combat at the granary was especially brutal, as Hungarian grenadiers battled unsuccessfully to dislodge the French from their positions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>and</b> <b>third</b> floors. The battle resumed at dawn of 22 April. Masséna cleared Aspern of Austrians, but while he did so, Rosenberg's force stormed Jean Lannes' position at Essling. Lannes, reinforced by Vincent Saint-Hilaire's division, subsequently drove Rosenberg out of Essling. At Aspern, Masséna was driven out by Hiller and Bellegarde's counter-attacks.|$|E
5|$|During his loan spell at Millwall, Doyle had {{suggested}} {{he might want}} to stay with the club on a permanent basis, despite the offer of a new contract from his parent club. However, {{at the end of the}} season he signed a two-year deal with Birmingham. Because Vaesen's contract had expired, there was an expectation that Doyle would step up to second-choice goalkeeper behind Maik Taylor. Doyle played his first competitive match for Birmingham in their League Cup first-round match against Shrewsbury Town on 22 August 2006, in which he kept a clean sheet as his club won 1–0. With Taylor injured, Doyle made his first league appearance for Birmingham four days later in a 2–0 defeat away to Cardiff City. Doyle played <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>and</b> <b>third</b> rounds of the League Cup, against Wrexham and Sheffield United, before losing his place in the cup team to Taylor for the quarter-final defeat to Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{of modern}} human {{habitation}} in Malaysia dates back 40,000years. In the Malay Peninsula, the first inhabitants {{are thought to}} be Negritos. Traders and settlers from India and China arrived as early as the first century AD, establishing trading ports and coastal towns <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>and</b> <b>third</b> centuries. Their presence resulted in strong Indian and Chinese influences on the local cultures, and the people of the Malay Peninsula adopted the religions of Hinduism and Buddhism. Sanskrit inscriptions appear as early as the fourth or fifth century. The Kingdom of Langkasuka arose around the second century in the northern area of the Malay Peninsula, lasting until about the 15th century. Between the 7th and 13th centuries, much of the southern Malay Peninsula was part of the maritime Srivijayan empire. By the 13th and the 14th century, the Majapahit empire had successfully wrested control over most of the peninsula and the Malay Archipelago from Srivijaya. Islam began to spread among Malays in the 14th century. In the early 15th century, Parameswara, a runaway king of the former Kingdom of Singapura linked to the old Srivijayan court, founded the Malacca Sultanate. Melaka was an important commercial centre during this time, attracting trade from around the region.|$|E
