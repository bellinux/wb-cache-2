5|$|Because {{molecular}} diagnostics {{methods can}} detect sensitive markers, these tests are less intrusive than a traditional biopsy. For example, because cell-free nucleic acids exist in human plasma, a simple blood sample can {{be enough to}} sample genetic information from tumours, transplants or an unborn fetus. Many, but not all, molecular diagnostics methods based on nucleic acids detection use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to vastly {{increase the number of}} nucleic acid molecules, thereby amplifying the target sequence(s) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> sample. The detection of the marker might use real time PCR, direct sequencing, or microarray chipsprefabricated chips that test many markers at once. The same principle applies to the proteome and the genome. High-throughput protein arrays can use complementary DNA or antibodies to bind and hence can detect many different proteins in parallel.|$|E
5|$|Remote afterloading systems provide {{protection}} from radiation exposure to healthcare professionals by securing the radiation source in a shielded safe. Once the applicators are correctly positioned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient,</b> they {{are connected to}} an ‘afterloader’ machine (containing the radioactive sources) {{through a series of}} connecting guide tubes. The treatment plan is sent to the afterloader, which then controls the delivery of the sources along the guide tubes into the pre-specified positions within the applicator. This process is only engaged once staff are removed from the treatment room. The sources remain in place for a pre-specified length of time, again following the treatment plan, following which they are returned along the tubes to the afterloader.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} {{correlation}} between the parameters of eTRACKING detection of femoral artery and the syndrome types of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in type 2 diabetic patients so as to provide clinical evidence for early prevention and treatment of diabetic lower extremity arterial disease. Methods: A total of 147 cases of type 2 diabetic patients were included. Basic data and TCM clinical information were collected, and eTRACKING detection of common femoral arteries was performed. Differentiation of symptoms and signs for classification of TCM syndromes was performed <b>in</b> all <b>patients.</b> <b>The</b> correlations between TCM syndrome and pressure-strain elastic modulus (Ep), stiffness parameter β, arterial compliance (AC), pulse wave velocity β (PWVβ), and augmentation index (AI) in common femoral arteries were observed. Results: <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> with deficiency of both yin and yang, the Ep value was higher than that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> with deficiency of both qi and yin, the stiffness parameter β was higher than that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other three syndrome types (deficiency of both qi and yin, excessive heat due to yin deficiency, accumulation of damp-beat <b>in</b> spleen), <b>the</b> AC value was lower than that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> with excessive heat due to yin deficiency, the PWVβ value was higher than that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> with excessive heat due to yin deficiency and deficiency of both qi and yin, and the AI value was higher than that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> with excessive heat due to yin deficiency. The stiffness parameter β <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> with deficiency of both qi and yin was higher than that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> with accumulation of damp-heat <b>in</b> spleen. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> with blood stasis, the Ep value was higher and the AC value was lower than that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> without blood stasis. Conclusion: The decrease of elasticity in lower extremities can be detected by eTRACKING. This study reveals that type 2 diabetic patients with deficiency of both yin and yang, accumulation of damp-heat in spleen and blood stasis have more severe lower extremity arteriosclerosis. In eTRACKING parameters, stiffness parameter β, AC and PWVβ may become <b>the</b> objective indexes <b>in</b> evaluating early diabetic lower extremity arteriosclerosis...|$|R

25|$|Furthermore, when warranted, {{specific}} tests—the mirror test, vasoconstriction examinations, and the Cottle maneuver—are {{included to}} the pre-operative {{evaluation of the}} prospective rhinoplasty patient. Established by Maurice H. Cottle (1898–1981), the Cottle maneuver is a principal diagnostic technique for detecting an internal nasal-valve disorder; whilst the patient gently inspires, the surgeon laterally pulls the patient's cheek, thereby simulating the widening of the cross-sectional area of the corresponding internal nasal valve. If the maneuver notably facilitates the patient's inspiration, that result is a positive Cottle sign—which generally indicates an airflow-correction to be surgically effected with an installed spreader-graft. Said correction will improve the internal angle of the nasal valve and thus allow unobstructed breathing. Nonetheless, the Cottle maneuver occasionally yields a false-positive Cottle sign, usually observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> afflicted with alar collapse, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> with a scarred nasal-valve region.|$|E
