In the last years, as in other sporting branches, also aerobic gymnastics incurred changes in regulation with significant impacts on the content and dynamics of the exercises, {{as well as on the}} <b>functional</b> <b>stress</b> level caused by such exercises, all those transposing in coaching methods and contents addressing especially the targeted performance criteria. Practice proved that in the last years, out of the three performance criteria, the Romanian sportsmen obtain high grades for Difficulty and Execution elements and low grades for Artistic element, which integrates the music and musicality, aerobic content, general content, use of space and artistic sub-criteria. In such context, we aim to optimize the artistic coaching by using a wide range of bodily and musical techniques applied under <b>functional</b> <b>stress</b> conditions as closer to the actual competing <b>functional</b> <b>stress</b> conditions as possible...|$|E

Objectives: The {{aim of the}} thesis is to compare maximal functional parameters of ski-mountaineerers measured during three functional laboratory stress tests. The <b>functional</b> <b>stress</b> tests were set on a treadmill, bicycle ergometer, and on a ski-mountaineer trainer. Consecutively, there is evaluated the meaning of testing of the functional parameters on the ski-mountaineer trainer. Methods: Interindividual and intraindividual descriptive study of 10 ski-mountaineerers of middle and high level performance.

40|$|The {{pattern of}} {{distribution}} of cartilage thickness in corresponding femoral heads and acetabula was ascertained in ten hip joints. The differences between individual acetabula and their corresponding heads were small enough {{for it to}} be admissible to calculate an average distribution pattern for head and socket.

(c) In the 'natural position' of the hip joint the points of maximum thickness of head and acetabular cartilage do not correspond.

Specific procedures for measurement of the microcirculation index by LDF and individual variability of microcirculation parameters during their real time assessment in vivo are discussed. In physiological conditions, a relative deviation {{of the results of}} measurements by LDF is within the range± 35 % and above from the mean value of the microcirculation index. This imposes certain limitations on the interpretation of the diagnostic results in terms of the “normal or pathologic”. Specifics of performance of <b>functional</b> <b>stress</b> tests on the microcirculation system are reviewed. Diagnostic criteria based on <b>functional</b> <b>stress</b> testing of the microcirculation system, which can be implemented with methodologically strict normatives and regulations, for examples, those for the occlusion test, are more reliable from metrologic perspective and significant compared to the results obtained without stress testing.

BackgroundPatients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) and inconclusive noninvasive cardiac stress tests represent a frequent management challenge. MethodsWe examined 529 consecutive patients with suspected CAD and prior inconclusive <b>functional</b> <b>stress</b> tests. All patients underwent a coronary CTA scan using a 64 -slice multidetector row scanner. CAD severity by coronary CTA was categorized as: 1) no evidence of CAD; 2) nonobstructive coronary plaques (< 30 %); 3) mild stenosis (30 % to 49 %); 4) moderate stenosis (50 % to 69 %); and 5) severe stenosis (≥ 70 %). Patients were also categorized according to a modified Duke prognostic CAD index. Survival analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for baseline risk factors and coronary artery calcium score. The primary outcome {{of the study was}} the combined endpoint of all-cause mortality and nonfatal myocardial infarction. ResultsAmong patients with inconclusive stress tests, the large majority (69 %) did not demonstrate significant CAD by coronary CTA. During a mean follow-up of 30. 1 ± 11. 1 months, there were 20 (3. 8 %) deaths and 17 (3. 2 %) nonfatal myocardial infarctions. Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that the presence of increasing degrees of obstructive CAD by CTA was an independent predictor of adverse events (hazard ratio [HR]: 1. 66 [95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 23 to 2. 23], p = 0. 001). Indeed, the presence of ≥ 50 % coronary stenosis was associated with an increased risk of events (HR: 3. 15 [95 % CI: 1. 26 to 7. 89], p = 0. 01). Likewise, the Duke prognostic CAD index was also found to be an independent predictor of events (HR: 1. 54 [95 % CI: 1. 20 to 1. 97], p = 0. 001). ConclusionsAmong patients with inconclusive <b>functional</b> <b>stress</b> tests, the noninvasive assessment of CAD severity by coronary CTA has been shown to provide incremental prognostic information beyond the evaluation of traditional risk factors and coronary artery calcium score...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{veneering}} {{process of}} frameworks induces residual stresses and can initiate cracks {{when combined with}} <b>functional</b> <b>stresses.</b> The stress distribution within the veneering ceramic {{as a function of}} depth is a key factor influencing failure by chipping. This is a well-known problem with Yttria-tetragonal-zirconia-polycrystal based fixed partial dentures. The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the influence of veneer thickness on the stress profile in zirconia- and metal-based structures. METHODS: The hole-drilling method, often used for engineering measurements, was adapted for use with veneering ceramic. The stress profile was measured in bilayered disc samples of 20 mm diameter, with a 1 mm thick zirconia or metal framework. Different veneering ceramic thicknesses were performed: 1 mm, 1. 5 mm, 2 mm, 2. 5 mm and 3 mm. RESULTS: All samples exhibited the same type of stress vs. depth profile, starting with compressive at the ceramic surface, decreasing with depth up to 0. 5 - 1. 0 mm from the surface, and then becoming compressive again near the framework, except for the 1. 5 mm-veneered zirconia samples which exhibited interior tensile stresses. Stresses in the surface of metal samples were not influenced by veneer thickness. Variation of interior stresses at 1. 2 mm from the surface in function of veneer thickness was inverted for metal and zirconia samples. SIGNIFICANCE: Veneer thickness influences in an opposite way the residual stress profile in metal- and in zirconia-based structures. A three-step approach and the hypothesis of the crystalline transformation are discussed to explain the less favorable residual stress development in zirconia samples. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|To {{mitigate}} {{the impact of}} natural or man-made hazards on the services of an infrastructure facility, {{it is important to}} quantitatively assess its available capacity. For example, in a post-disaster scenario, critical infrastructure is likely to experience (i) excessive demand for the service of an infrastructure and/or (ii) compromised capacity because of damage to the infrastructure and the failure of infrastructure interdependencies. As the demand grows and nears the capacity limit of an infrastructure facility, a shortage of services required for the community&# 039;s recovery will occur. The development of mitigation strategies and an assessment of their effectiveness require a systematic approach. In this paper, a functional stress-strain principle for infrastructure facilities is proposed to quantitatively assess their serviceability in post-disaster scenarios. <b>Functional</b> <b>stress</b> in infrastructure management represents a service-related demand on an infrastructure facility, while strain indicates its coping capacity. The dynamic nature of infrastructure services will be considered depending on the relationship between demand and available capacity. The allowable range of <b>functional</b> <b>stress</b> is then defined, considering plastic and elastic patterns of responses of a facility during recovery to explore strain capacity variations. The proposed principle facilitates a systematic understanding of how infrastructure facilities can adapt themselves to growing stress and the maximum level of stress they can handle.

The study focused on somatic (standardized BMI) and psychological aspects (collective self-efficacy, social insecurity) as well as on leisure time activity patterns and stress coping behaviour. Furthermore, it was checked if pathological computer gaming was related to the attended school type („Hauptschule“, „Realschule“ or „Gymnasium“) or the attended class level (8 th or 10 th form). method 828 students were asked to answer self-questionnaires concerning their computer gaming behaviour (CSVK-R 2, Wölfling & Müller, 2009), their social insecurity (EDI- 2, Skala SU; Paul & Thiel, 2004) and their collective self-efficacy (Jerusalem & Schwarzer, 1999). results 16, 90 % of the students didn’t play computer games at all, 75, 40 % showed non-pathological gaming behaviour. 7, 70 % were identified as pathological gamers (abusive gaming behaviour: 6, 40 %; dependent gaming behaviour: 1, 30 %). In contrast to non-pathological gamers and non-gamers, pathological gamers show a significantly reduced leisure time activity pattern. Compared to non-pathological gamers and non-gamers, pathological gamers use significantly less often <b>functional</b> <b>stress</b> coping strategies (e. g. looking for social support or talking about the problem) and prefer significantly more often stress coping strategies that focus on using electronic media. Furthermore, pathological gamers tend to use significantly more psychotropic substances as a stress coping strategy than non-pathological gamers do. Results show that in contrast to non-pathological gamers and non-gamers, pathological gamers display a significantly higher level of social insecurity and a significantly lower collective self-efficacy. No significant differences could be found between the groups concerning the standardized BMI. Neither the attended school type nor the attended class level showed a correlation to pathological gaming behaviour. Within the group of pathological gamers, no significant differences could be found between abusive and dependent gamers concerning the leisure time activity patterns, the level of social insecurity or the collective self-efficacy. Both subgroups of pathological gamers differ significantly in their preferred stress coping strategy, dependent gamers using significantly less often functional coping strategies and significantly more often psychotropic substances or electronic media than abusive gamers do. discussion The results show that pathological gamers display a significantly reduced collective self-efficacy as well as a higher level of social insecurity. At the same time, pathological gamers use gaming as a form of (dysfunctional) stress coping strategy, whereas they use <b>functional</b> <b>stress</b> coping strategies significantly less often than non-pathological gamers or non-gamers. This being a cross-sectional-study, no conclusion can be drawn about the effective direction. Nevertheless, the results provide essential information for therapy of pathological gaming behaviour.

At the same time, leisure time activity pattern should be broadened. Results concerning differences between abusive and dependent gamers are inconsistent, but there is evidence that both groups are distinct from each other and need different therapeutic treatment strategies...|$|E

40|$|Cross-striated {{muscles of}} frogs and rats were fixed in 3. 3 per cent lead nitrate solution. Frozen {{sections}} 30 micra thick were mounted in different media and observed by polarization microscopy. The subneural apparatus of myoneural junctions exhibits a strong birefringence in these sections. Birefringence is exerted by a highly organized lipoprotein framework (postsynaptic material) which builds up the "organites" (junctional folds) of the postsynaptic membrane. Synaptic cholinesterase is {{closely associated with}} this material. Freezing and/or formalin fixation results in a destruction of the molecular organization of the postsynaptic material, but does not influence the synaptic enzyme activity. It is hypothesized from this study that the junctional folds (postsynaptic "organites") consist of regularly arranged, sheet-like lamellar micellae in the frog and of less regular, mainly radially arranged submicroscopic units in the rat. The micellar organization as revealed by polarization analysis is in good agreement with the electron microscopic findings reported in the literature. Intramicellar protein molecules of the resting postsynaptic membrane are arranged longitudinally, lipids transversely. Supramaximal stimulation or treatment with acetylcholine + eserine results in a disorganization of proteins and a rearrangement of lipids.

As a result of either thirst or sodium chloride load, the volume of mitochondria per nerve cell more than doubled. 'The rate of succinate oxidation was not changed after the rats had been thirsting but was enhanced by over 100 % after they had drunk sodium chloride. A linear relationship was found for the amount of mitochondria versus respiration in the supraoptic neurons for all experimental groups except the thirsting animals.

40|$|SUMMARY Studies of the {{structure}} of blood vessels have commonly found that cells lining the vessels are lengthened in the direction of blood flow, presumably as an effect of shear stress. A study of aortic valves has, however, shown that endothelial cells covering both sides of aortic valve leaflets are arranged across the direction of flow. Aortic valve leaflets taken from seven adult mongrel dogs and fixed either open or closed with glutaraldehyde were studied with a scanning electron microscope after critical point drying. O n both open and closed leaflets the endothelial cells tended to be aligned circumferentially with the free edge of the leaflet. The circumferential pattern was particularly unexpected on the leaflet surface facing the left ventricle because this surface could be expected to receive the full effect of shear stress from systolic blood flow. The finding suggested that surface cellular alignment on leaflets is determined by some force other than shear stress. The force apparently responsible for organising the collagenous layers in the leaflet, which are best adapted to bear stress, is diastolic blood pressure. Since the endothelium follows the same pattern of alignment as the layers of collagen it seems reasonable to conclude that endothelial orientation is also a response ultimately to pressure stress. The arrangement of the endothelium then serves as a readily observed indicator of those <b>functional</b> <b>stresses</b> that dominate and organise leaflet structure...|$|R

There is also a significant interaction between species and cranial regions. The braincase sutures show higher fractal dimension than the facial skull sutures for all three species. The fractal dimension of nasal-maxilla suture is larger in Caiman latirostris than in the other species. The braincase sutures show higher fractal dimensions in C. sclerops than in the other species. The results suggest that different regions of the skull in caimans are under differential <b>functional</b> <b>stress</b> and the braincase sutures must counteract stronger disarticulation forces than the facial sutures. The larger fractal dimension shown by C. latirostris in facial sutures has probably a functional basis also.

40|$|Patients with {{suspected}} {{coronary artery}} disease often undergo coronary angiography without prior non-invasive <b>functional</b> <b>stress</b> testing, mainly because of logistic reasons, shortcomings of the non-invasive tests, and a more widespread confidence in invasive techniques. The availability in the catheterization laboratory of the pressure-derived fractional flow reserve (FFR) has provided the interventional cardiologist with the ideal tool for appropriate decision-making based on the functional significance of the coronary stenosis detected at the angiogram. In fact, FFR allows a more refined and individualized understanding of the true severity of {{coronary artery disease}}, and, therefore, a more appropriate selection of the epicardial lesions to be treated, especially in patients with dubious lesions and complex disease. A clinical decision-making based on coronary pressure measurement results in a more effective strategy than placing stents on a "trial and error" basis. This is particularly true in case of drug-eluting stents where an approach based on an indiscriminate multi-stenting will annihilate the benefits of these new stents and be unacceptably expensive.
