5|$|The Appalachian Trail is {{relatively}} safe. Most injuries or <b>incidents</b> <b>are</b> consistent with comparable outdoor activities. Most hazards {{are related to}} weather conditions, human error, plants, animals, diseases, and hostile humans encountered along the trail.|$|E
5|$|As {{human populations}} increase, {{and as they}} build houses in low-lying areas or fish or hunt near water, <b>incidents</b> <b>are</b> {{inevitable}} where American alligators intrude, or at least appear to intrude, on human life. Since 1948, 257 documented attacks on humans in Florida (about five incidents per year) have been reported, of which an estimated 23 resulted in death. Only nine fatal attacks occurred in the United States throughout the 1970s–1990s, but American alligators killed 12 people between 2001 and 2007. In May 2006, American alligators killed three Floridians {{in less than a}} week. There have been at least 28 fatal attacks by American alligators in the United States since 1970.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{poisoning}} <b>incidents</b> <b>are</b> unintentional {{and result}} from errors in identification. Recent cases highlight {{the issue of}} the similarity of A.phalloides to the edible paddy straw mushroom, Volvariella volvacea, with East- and Southeast-Asian immigrants in Australia and the west coast of the United States falling victim. In an episode in Oregon, four members of a Korean family required liver transplants. Of the 9 people poisoned in the Canberra region between 1988 and 2011, three were from Laos and two were from China.|$|E

50|$|The <b>incident</b> <b>is</b> {{included}} in the eighth instalment of the Dynasty Warriors franchise. However, the <b>incident</b> <b>is</b> foretold as a battle, which defies the fact no violence occurred during the historical incident.|$|R
50|$|Not {{all such}} <b>incidents</b> <b>were</b> {{distressing}} {{to the youth}} who experienced them. Distressing <b>incidents</b> <b>were</b> episodes where youth rated themselves as very or extremely upset or afraid {{as a result of}} the incident.|$|R
5|$|Oda (or Odo; died 958), {{called the}} Good or the Severe, was a 10th-century Archbishop of Canterbury in England. The {{son of a}} Danish invader, Oda became Bishop of Ramsbury before 928. A number of stories were told about his actions both prior to {{becoming}} and while a bishop, but few of these <b>incidents</b> <b>are</b> recorded in contemporary accounts. After being named to Canterbury in 941, Oda was instrumental in crafting royal legislation as well as involved in providing rules for his clergy. Oda was also involved in the efforts to reform religious life in England. He died in 958 and legendary tales afterwards were ascribed to him. Later he came {{to be regarded as}} a saint, and a hagiography was written in the late 11th or early 12th century.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these pre-Galfridian Welsh poems and tales, Arthur appears in some other early Latin texts besides the Historia Brittonum and the Annales Cambriae. In particular, Arthur features {{in a number of}} well-known vitae ("Lives") of post-Roman saints, none of which are now generally considered to be reliable historical sources (the earliest probably dates from the 11th century). According to the Life of Saint Gildas, written in the early 12th century by Caradoc of Llancarfan, Arthur is said to have killed Gildas' brother Hueil and to have rescued his wife Gwenhwyfar from Glastonbury. In the Life of Saint Cadoc, written around 1100 or a little before by Lifris of Llancarfan, the saint gives protection to a man who killed three of Arthur's soldiers, and Arthur demands a herd of cattle as wergeld for his men. Cadoc delivers them as demanded, but when Arthur takes possession of the animals, they turn into bundles of ferns. Similar <b>incidents</b> <b>are</b> described in the medieval biographies of Carannog, Padarn, and Eufflam, probably written around the 12th century. A less obviously legendary account of Arthur appears in the Legenda Sancti Goeznovii, which is often claimed to date from the early 11th century (although the earliest manuscript of this text dates from the 15th century). Also important are the references to Arthur in William of Malmesbury's De Gestis Regum Anglorum and Herman's De Miraculis Sanctae Mariae Laudensis, which together provide the first certain evidence for a belief that Arthur was not actually dead and would at some point return, a theme that is often revisited in post-Galfridian folklore.|$|E

50|$|The <b>incident</b> <b>was</b> {{the subject}} of a book, The Allagash Abductions by Raymond E. Fowler. The <b>incident</b> <b>was</b> also dramatized in an episode of Unsolved Mysteries and {{featured}} in the TV program Abducted by UFOs.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: : Research on {{patient safety}} in allied {{healthcare}} is scarce. Our {{aim was to}} document patient safety in primary allied healthcare in the Netherlands and to identify factors associated with incidents. DESIGN AND SUBJECT:: A retrospective study of 1000 patient records in {{a representative sample of}} 20 allied healthcare practices was combined with a prospective incident-reporting study. MEASURES: : All records were reviewed by trained researchers to identify patient safety <b>incidents.</b> The <b>incidents</b> <b>were</b> classified and analyzed, using the Prevention and Recovery Information System for Monitoring and Analysis method. Factors associated with <b>incidents</b> <b>were</b> examined in a logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: : In 18 out of 1000 (1. 8 %; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 0 - 2. 6) records an <b>incident</b> <b>was</b> detected. The main causes of <b>incidents</b> <b>were</b> related to errors in clinical decisions (89 %), communication with other healthcare providers (67 %), and monitoring (56 %). The probability of <b>incidents</b> <b>was</b> higher if more care providers had been involved and if patient records were incomplete (37 % of the records). No <b>incidents</b> <b>were</b> reported in the prospective study. CONCLUSIONS: : The absolute number of <b>incidents</b> <b>was</b> low, which could imply a low risk of harm in Dutch primary allied healthcare. Nevertheless, incompleteness of the patient records and the fact that <b>incidents</b> <b>were</b> mainly caused through human actions suggest that a focus on clinical reasoning and record keeping is needed to further enhance patient safety. Improvements in record keeping will be necessary before accurate <b>incident</b> reporting will <b>be</b> feasible and valid...|$|R

25|$|According to {{the three}} Synoptic Gospels, Jesus {{performed}} many exorcisms of demoniacs. These <b>incidents</b> <b>are</b> {{not mentioned in the}} Gospel of John and appear to have been excluded due to theological considerations.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the notable}} cases of murdered raped victims and the massacres {{associated}} with the rape <b>incidents</b> <b>are</b> – Krishanti Kumaraswamy, Arumaithurai Tharmaletchumi, Ida Carmelitta, Ilayathambi Tharsini, Murugesapillai Koneswary, Premini Thanuskodi, Sarathambal, Thambipillai Thanalakshmi, Kumarapuram massacre and Vankalai massacre.|$|E
25|$|Abusive {{supervision}} {{overlaps with}} workplace bullying {{in the workplace}} context. Research suggests that 75% of workplace bullying <b>incidents</b> <b>are</b> perpetrated by hierarchically superior agents. Abusive supervision differs from related constructs such as supervisor bullying and undermining in {{that it does not}} describe the intentions or objectives of the supervisor.|$|E
50|$|The <b>incident</b> <b>was</b> one of {{the main}} themes of {{progressive}} metal band Savatage's concept album The Wake of Magellan. A partially fictionalized version of the <b>incident</b> <b>was</b> the plot of the book The Stowaway by Robert Hough.|$|R

25|$|Though the {{cease fire}} in the UNDOF zone has been largely {{uninterrupted}} since the seventies, in 2012 there have been repeated violations from the Syrian side, including tanks and live fire, though these <b>incidents</b> <b>are</b> attributed to the ongoing Syrian civil war rather than intentionally directed towards Israel.|$|E
25|$|Firedamp explosions {{can trigger}} the much-more-dangerous coal dust explosions, which can engulf an entire pit. Most of these risks can be greatly reduced in modern mines, and {{multiple}} fatality <b>incidents</b> <b>are</b> now rare {{in some parts}} of the developed world. Modern mining in the US results in approximately 30 deaths per year due to mine accidents.|$|E
25|$|People {{who support}} and found reasons {{to feel good}} over these <b>incidents</b> <b>are</b> doing more than one wrong thing: first, {{ignoring}} the tragedy of killing an innocent group of people. Second, not thinking about the reaction of showing they found satisfaction in the incidents. Third, they are considered accomplices in the crime. Fourth, they are committing a wrongful act not approved by religion.|$|E
25|$|During November 2013 alone, six anti-semitic <b>incidents</b> <b>were</b> {{recorded}} throughout Antwerp. These {{include the}} chasing of Jewish {{children and the}} attack of an old Jewish woman. All the <b>incidents</b> <b>were</b> committed by men of Middle Eastern or North African descent.|$|R
30|$|The {{prediction}} model must adopt incomplete information because when an <b>incident</b> <b>is</b> reported, {{only part of}} the information on the <b>incident</b> can <b>be</b> obtained for <b>incident</b> duration prediction and even until the <b>incident</b> <b>is</b> cleared. Obtaining all the information that influences the traffic <b>incident</b> duration time <b>is</b> impossible. For example, if no traffic detector is present near the incident location, then obtaining the volume of traffic that passes through the <b>incident</b> location <b>is</b> almost impossible. Thus, the traffic incident duration {{prediction model}} to be developed should have the ability to consider incidents with incomplete information.|$|R
50|$|An <b>incident</b> book <b>is</b> a book {{used for}} {{recording}} injuries, crimes, and other incidents; they {{are included in}} British police boxes, hospitals, and other locations in which an <b>incident</b> <b>is</b> to be reported or treated.|$|R
25|$|According to {{government}} figures Southampton {{has a higher}} crime rate than the national average. There is some controversy regarding comparative crime statistics due to inconsistencies between different police forces recording methodologies. For example, in Hampshire all reported <b>incidents</b> <b>are</b> recorded and all records then retained. However, in neighbouring Dorset crimes reports withdrawn or shown to be false are not recorded, reducing apparent crime figures.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the {{cultural}} implications of the laws and constitutional amendments regarding Ahmadis in Pakistan, persecution and hate-related <b>incidents</b> <b>are</b> constantly reported from different parts of the country. Ahmadis have been the target of many attacks led by various religious groups. All religious seminaries and madrasas in Pakistan belonging to different sects of Islam have prescribed essential reading materials specifically targeted at refuting Ahmadiyya beliefs.|$|E
25|$|The {{safety of}} {{irradiation}} facilities is {{regulated by the}} United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency and monitored by the different national Nuclear Regulatory Commissions.

50|$|A bias {{incident}} or hate <b>incident</b> <b>is</b> an act {{of hostility}} motivated by racism, religious intolerance, or other prejudice.

25|$|When college {{students}} were surveyed, {{it was found}} that 35% do not tell anyone about a sexual harassment occurrence, 49% tell a friend, and only 7% go to a school faculty member to report the incident. Female students especially were noted to hesitate to report these incidents in fear that the <b>incidents</b> <b>are</b> not important enough or a large enough deal. 54% of the surveyed {{college students}} listed this as a reason for not reporting sexual harassment.|$|E
25|$|Belief in {{witchcraft}} {{continues to}} be present today in some societies and accusations of witchcraft are the trigger of serious forms of violence, including murder. Such <b>incidents</b> <b>are</b> common {{in places such as}} Burkina Faso, Ghana, India, Kenya, Malawi, Nepal and Tanzania. Accusations of witchcraft are sometimes linked to personal disputes, jealousy, and conflicts between neighbors or family over land or inheritance. Witchcraft related violence is often discussed as a serious issue in the broader context of violence against women.|$|E
25|$|Bullying {{has been}} {{identified}} as prominent in blue collar jobs including on the oil rigs and in mechanic shops and machine shops. It is thought that intimidation and fear of retribution cause decreased incident reports. This is also an industry dominated by males, where disclosure of <b>incidents</b> <b>are</b> seen as , which, in the socioeconomic and cultural milieu of such industries, would likely lead to a vicious circle. This is often used in combination with manipulation and coercion of facts to gain favour among higher ranking administrators.|$|E
