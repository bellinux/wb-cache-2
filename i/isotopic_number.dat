40|$|The carbon isotopic {{composition}} of individual organic compounds of meteoritic origin remains unknown, as most reported carbon isotopic ratios are for bulk carbon or solvent extractable fractions. The researchers managed {{to determine the}} carbon isotopic ratios for individual hydrocarbons and monocarboxylic acids isolated from a Murchison sample by a freeze-thaw-ultrasonication technique. The abundances of monocarboxylic acids and saturated hydrocarbons decreased with increasing carbon number and the acids are more abundant than the hydrocarbon with the same carbon number. For both classes of compounds, the C- 13 to C- 12 ratios decreased with increasing carbon number in a roughly parallel manner, and each carboxylic acid exhibits a higher <b>isotopic</b> <b>number</b> than the hydrocarbon containing {{the same number of}} carbon atoms.

40|$|Quantum {{estimates}} of several alpha radioactive life time {{have been made}} using the probability of quantum tunneling through the nuclear potential barrier. It is assumed that for a given nucleus with mass number A and <b>isotopic</b> <b>number</b> Z, there exists an alpha particle moving freely {{back and forth in}} the nucleus with mass and isotopic numbers A - 4 and Z- 2. If the probability of penetrating the nuclear potential barrier is Τ, then after N times (N= 1 /Τ) hitting the barrier an alpha particle is emitted. To obtain the elapsed time for emitting an alpha particle requires N times τ 0, where τ 0 is the time travel for alpha across the nuclear diameter, which is dependent on alpha energy. It is assumed here that this kinetic energy is the same as the emitted energy. The emitting alpha kinetic energies here are calculated by the difference of the masses of the parent and daughter nuclei and the alpha particles. They are in closed agreement with the experimental observations. While the alpha radioactive life time are not the same order of magnitudes but give the same linearity on the logarithmic scale as function of the inverse square root of energy...|$|E

40|$|Isotopic {{composition}} of reactants affects {{the rates of}} chemical and biochemical reactions. As a rule, enrichment of heavy stable isotopes leads to slower reactions. But the recent isotopic resonance hypothesis suggests that the dependence of the reaction rate upon the enrichment degree is not monotonous; instead, at some resonance isotopic compositions, the kinetics increases, while at off resonance compositions the same reactions progress slower. To test the predictions of this hypothesis for the elements C, H, N and O, we designed a precise (standard error plus or minus 0. 05 %) experiment to measure the bacterial growth parameters in minimal media with varying <b>isotopic</b> compositions. A <b>number</b> of predicted resonance conditions were tested, which kinetic enhancements as strong as plus 3 % discovered at these conditions.

Paleoclimate records allow one to assess the full range of drought (or flood) variability by utilizing data that span longer periods of time. That is to know whether a historic and recorded flood or drought event is a representative (recurring) one or a rare extreme event, and if recurring, what its recurring time interval (i.e., hydrologic return period). A good paleoclimate record (data) helps in evaluating the regional sensitivity of global climate models (i.e., validation of global climate models) for predictive purposes and for its applications related to integrated water resources management.

In this model the elementary fermions are low lying states of the quantum trefoil (N= 3) and the gauge bosons are ditrefoils (N= 6).

40|$|Abstract: A unified {{scale is}} {{recommended}} for reporting the NMR chemical shifts of all nuclei relative to the 1 H resonance of tetramethylsilane. The unified scale {{is designed to provide}} a precise ratio, Ξ, of the resonance frequency of a given nuclide to that of the primary reference, the 1 H resonance of tetramethylsilane (TMS) in dilute solution (volume fraction, ϕ < 1 %) in chloroform. Referencing procedures are discussed, including matters of practical application of the unified scale. Special attention is paid to recommended reference samples, and values of Ξ for secondary references on the unified scale are listed, many of which are the results of new measurements. Some earlier recommendations relating to the reporting of chemical shifts are endorsed. The chemical shift, δ, is redefined to avoid previous ambiguities but to leave practical usage unchanged. Relations between the unified scale and recently published recommendations for referencing in aqueous solutions (for specific use in biochemical work) are discussed, as well as the special effects of working in the solid state with magic-angle spinning. In all, nine new recommendations relating to chemical shifts are made. Standardized nuclear spin data are also presented in tabular form for the stable (and some unstable) isotopes of all elements with non-zero quantum numbers. The information given includes quantum <b>numbers,</b> <b>isotopic</b> abundances, magnetic moments, magnetogyric ratios and receptivities, together with quadrupol...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe recent <b>number</b> <b>isotopic</b> records {{extracted}} from Andean ice cores (South America) has illustrated the key role such archives {{can play in}} past climate reconstructions. Nevertheless, interpreting isotopic archives as quantified climate proxies requires an understanding of which climate parameters control the stable isotopic composition of water. Mesoscale modeling sheds {{new light on the}} meteorological mechanisms dominant during austral summer. Here we focus on the variability of the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ) and its repercussions on upstream regions. The SACZ is a major component of the South American Monsoon System (SAMS). The present study uses the isotopic signature of the SAMS, as simulated by the stable water isotope enabled regional circulation model REMO iso to answer the question: how does the SAMS affect the isotopic composition of precipitation during the wet season? In order to analyze the internal, purely atmospheric variability mode, the model was forced by climatological sea-surface temperatures. We investigate the concurrent intraseasonal variability of meteorological and isotopic parameters at pentad (5 days) interval using empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs). REMO iso reproduces the main meteorological characteristics of the SAMS consistent with observations as well as previous modeling studies. Furthermore, we demonstrate that δ 18 O integrates both circulation and precipitation variability. This new evidence contributes to the comprehension of the δ 18 O signal in tropical South America, highlighting the internal atmospheric variability, as opposed to external forcing by Pacific and Atlantic sea-surface temperature...|$|R
40|$|The Miller-Urey (MU) {{experiment}} {{provided evidence}} supporting the abiogenesis theory, {{and is considered}} to be the seminal experiment in the context of origin of life. The MU mixture produced in the experiment is assumed to be an essential raw material for life emergence on the primitive Earth or beyond. However, there was no direct experimental evidence that this primordial soup supports life. In this thesis, we provided a proof that the abiotically produced MU mixture can support the growth of primitive living organisms, such as bacteria Escherichia coli. The recent Isotopic Resonance hypothesis suggests that the rates of chemical and biochemical reactions are not monotonous upon the enrichment degree of isotopic composition of reactants. Instead, at some “resonance” isotopic conditions with certain compositions of CHON, the kinetics increases or decreases compared to the “off-resonance” conditions. To test the predictions of this hypothesis, we designed a precise (standard error ± 0. 05 %) method to explore the bacterial growth behaviour under different <b>isotopic</b> compositions. A <b>number</b> of predicted resonances including the terrestrial resonance and several other non-terrestrial resonances were tested, with significant enhancements in kinetics discovered at most of these conditions. The terrestrial resonance was intensively studied with multiple living organisms including prokaryotic bacteria Escherichia coli, eukaryotic yeast, mammalian RKO cells, grass seeds and shrimp. All obtained results strongly confirm the preference of living organisms for the terrestrial resonance and support the validity of isotopic resonance phenomena.

40|$|The {{ecological}} systems {{are complex and}} multifold: many variables cooperate {{in the definition of}} the measured values and countless disturbances affect the sampling. Furthermore, often ecolog- ical systems show patterns of change both in time and space. Complexity calls for compromise: choosing a single driver of change, be it space or time, is always somewhat arbitrary owing to pre-packaged statistical analysis tools. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) are now widespread and offer many spatial modeling tools, but they lack the ability to capture the time variability. The statistical analysis of time series, on the other hand, is blind to spatial patterns. This work proposes an interpolation tool, which is able to include spatial as well as tem- poral variability: the Timescape Algorithm. This algorithm derives form the fusion of the consolidated spacetime interpolation techniques of Statistical Physics with the typical needs of {{ecological systems}} modeling. Two software versions have been derived from the general algo- rithm: a local (projected coordinates) and a global (longitude/latitude) version. The software is published according to an open license (GNU-GPL v 3. 0) and is distributed with a detailed manual, the source code and a sample dataset of isotopic abundances in precipitations. The software has been designed to be the slightest possible detour from a consolidated GIS work ow, since more and more researchers use a GIS environment for both data storage and modeling. The Timescape idea is the mathematical translation of a few quite general statements: -observations at different places and times can be mixed freely -the area of possible in uence grows with time -closer sites can in uence each other more than far ones -the value at a given time can in uence the future values The Timescape Algorithm has been presented at the 2016 European Geoscience Union Conference [Geophysical Research Abstracts Vol. 18, EGU 2016 - 15864, 2016]. Spatial and spatiotemporal modeling is illustrated through three case studies, re ecting the author's activities within his grant at the Institute of Agro-Environmental and Forest Biology of the National Research Council of Italy. The first case study, Mycorrhiza Survival Strategy, is centered on the use of carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes relative abundances to investigate the symbiotic relationships among 1 fungi (Tuber aestivum) and host trees. According to the current literature, the interaction has been modeled according to a simple isotope fractionation scheme: carbon owing from host to fungus shows negligible fractionation whilst nitrogen owing from mycorrhiza to trees displays fractionation. This research was the main driver {{for the development of the}} Timescape idea, since the temporal variability could not be neglected for the truffles, which can continuously change the isotopic compositions of the fruit bodies during the collection season. The experiment was conducted on a protected area in Umbria region, within the STINA interregional park. Here, old Pinus spp. stands were partially replaced with broadleaved species. Several detailed Isoscapes (thematic maps that show the spatial distribution of stable isotopes, thus tracing an isotopic landscape) were produced in order to map the spatial patterns of soil 15 N and leaves 15 N and 13 C. Soil and leaves did not need any special statistical treatment because their isotopic content is accumulated over time (one season for the leaves and longer times for the soil). Stumps were also sampled. The modeling shows a remarkable probability of symbiosis among tru es and pines. No signi cant statistical matching has been found with other species in the pine-cleared areas, suggesting a saprophytic behaviuor of the mycorrhiza, feeding on the remnant stumps. This relation seems to be con rmed by the isotopic signatures of the examined stumps. The results of this study have been presented at the First Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry Day - Constitution of the Italian IRMS Group [F. Camin (ed) - Proc 1 st IRMS Day, ISBN- 978 - 88 - 7843 - 046 - 4]. The second case is an Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) provenance assessment study for the geographic origin through carbon (13 C) and oxygen (18 O) stable isotopes. The aim is the protection of consumers from geofrauds i. e. the false declaration of origin which raise the product price pretending to use olives only from highly-reputed geographic areas. This kind of fraud is not related to the adulteration of EVOOs, for which consolidated chemical analysis methods exist, but to the subtler eld of falsely claimed geographical provenance. This study takes into account the isotopic compositions of 387 EVOO samples originated from di erent regions in the years of the 2009, 2010 and 2011 seasons. The autenticity of each harvesting was certi ed by UNAPROL, the consortium of EVOO producers. Ancillary meteorological and geomorphological data have been imported in a GIS framework for spatial isotopic modeling. In this case, contrary to the previous case study, there was no need to analyse time and space variability in a single model, since every year was treated independently from the others. This 2 is sensible since, statistically, both 13 C and 18 O fatty acids content integrates the carbon and water uptake from the atmosphere and available water, through the photosynthetic assimilation and the fractionation process occurring during the transpiration. It was assumed that the available water essentially re ects the integrated isotopic composition precipitations. The 13 C and 18 O values were compared to some geographical and meteorological param- eters. The best explanatory variables for isotope composition variations have been found to be the precipitation 18 O and the xerothermic index, with various R 2 gures according to the year; con dence intervals were calculated too. The result is a set of predicted isotopic maps (Isoscapes) : predicted 13 C for 2010 and 2011, and predicted 18 O for 2009, 2010 and 2011. The study of the predicted Isoscapes highlighted four zones: North, Central Thyrrenean, Southern Adriatic and Islands, which of course include more than one actual DOP and IGP production area. Isoscape analysis is a promising technique for contrasting geofrauds, especially if supported by other chemical analyses (e. g., heavy elements content). This study is published on Food Chemistry [Chiocchini et al. - Food Chemistry 202 (2016) 291 - 301. doi: 10. 1016 /j. foodchem. 2016. 01. 146]. The last case study concerns an ongoing project: Ecua ux. It is an international project about carbon ows and photosynthesis responses of Polylepis reticulata (locally called tree" for the nely layered structure of the bark), an endemic high altitude tree of the Southern Ecuadorian Andes. The collection of samples, including soil, tree cores, leaves and other tissues, has started in January 2016 and is planned to cover three or four years. The collection is being conducted on six separate forest plots in three di erent catchments at about 4000 m altitude, at the utmost altitudinal limit of the species. The sampling has been carefully designed for space and time modeling and will provide the ideal playground for testing the Timescape algorithm. The <b>isotopic</b> measurements (estimated <b>number</b> of about 2000 samples) will be centred on the reconstruction of the changes of the photosynthesis response in the area over the last years. Indeed, the study's site, the Cajas National Park in Ecuador, is an hot spot of climate change, being located at such high altitude on the equator and exposed to the climatic in uence of the Amazon Basin and the Paci c ocean as well. A few preliminary results can be seen on [URL] ux. I sistemi ecologici sono caratterizzati dalla variet a e complessit a delle relazioni tra grandezze misurabili e dalle innumerevoli fonti di disturbo sulle misure. Molto spesso i sistemi ecologici sono caratterizzati da una variabilit a sia spaziale che temporale. Il trattamento statistico della complessit a richiede importanti compromessi. Tuttavia, prediligere un unico fattore di cam- biamento, sia esso lo spazio o il tempo, e sempre arbitrario ed e legato essenzialmente all'uso di strumenti software preconfezionati per l'analisi geostatistica. I Sistemi Informativi Territo- riali (SIT o GIS: Geographical Information Systems) sono sempre pi u di usi e costituiscono validissimi strumenti di analisi geostatistica, ma non consentono di apprezzare la variabilit a temporale dei dati.

Queso lavoro propone uno strumento di interpolazione in grado di cogliere contemporanea- mente gli aspetti di variabilit a spaziale e temporale: l'Algoritmo Timescape. Questo algo- ritmo deriva dalla fusione di tecniche consolidate delle sica statistica con le esigenze tipiche dei sistemi complessi in ecologia. Per coprire tutte le scale di possibile interesse, dall'algoritmo ge- nerale sono stati derivati due software: il primo utilizza coordinate locali proiettate; il secondo le coordinate geogra che (latitudine e longitudine).
