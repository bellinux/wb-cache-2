5|$|Self-decoration is {{employed}} by animals in different groups, including decorator crabs, which attach materials from their environment, {{as well as}} living organisms, to camouflage themselves. For example, the Japanese <b>hermit</b> <b>crab,</b> Eupagurus constans, has the hydroid Hydractinia sodalis growing all over the shell that it lives in. Another <b>hermit</b> <b>crab,</b> Eupagurus cuanensis, has the aposematic orange sponge Suberites domuncula which is bitter-tasting and not eaten by fish.|$|E
5|$|Two of {{the more}} unusual {{relationships}} are those between certain anemones (such as Adamsia, Calliactis and Neoaiptasia) and hermit crabs or snails, and Bundeopsis or Triactis anemones and Lybia boxing crabs. In the former, the anemones live on the shell of the <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> or snail. In the latter, the small anemones are carried in the claws of the boxing crab.|$|E
5|$|After death, {{the empty}} shell of this sea snail {{is often used}} by hermit crabs. On {{the coast of the}} Caraguatatuba, Brazil, a study of shell use in the diogenid <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> species Isocheles sawayai was carried out. This study {{revealed}} that 11.5% of the population of these hermit crabs were using shells of Semicassis granulata. The occupation of shell type was reported as not being random, but was instead described as being influenced by the weight, size, shape and internal volume of the shell, the occurrence of epibionts such as bryozoans on the shell, and the degree of resistance the shell offered to predation and desiccation.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike other <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs,</b> pylochelid <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> are not {{markedly}} asymmetrical, with {{a straight}} body and equal numbers of appendages on both sides. This characteristic, together with the partial calcification of the abdomen (which is soft in other <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs)</b> led Edward J. Miers, when describing the first species, to consider it to represent a transition between <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> and [...] "Macrura" [...] (long-tailed decapods, such as lobsters and shrimp). Correspondingly, pylochelid <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> do not usually inhabit gastropod shells, but instead withdraw into decayed pieces of wood, stones, tusk shells (especially Dentaliidae), living sponges, pieces of bamboo or mangroves. Their claws are often adapted to form an operculum, which closes off the entrance to their home.|$|R
5000|$|The Diogenidae are {{a family}} of <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs,</b> {{sometimes}} known as [...] "left-handed hermit crabs" [...] because in contrast to most other <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs,</b> its left chela (claw) is enlarged instead of the right. It comprises 429 extant species, and a further 46 extinct species, making it the second-largest family of marine <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs,</b> after the Paguridae.|$|R
5000|$|The Pylojacquesidae are a {{small family}} of <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs,</b> {{comprising}} only two species in two genera. The family was erected in 2001, after two specimens at [...] at the [...] were recognised as being quite distinct from other described <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs.</b> The family members differ from other <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> in that their mandibles are chitinous and toothed.|$|R
5|$|Lobatus gigas is a prey {{species for}} several {{carnivorous}} gastropod mollusks, including the apple murex Phyllonotus pomum, the horse conch Pleuroploca gigantea, the lamp shell Turbinella angulata, the moon snails Natica spp. and Polinices spp., the muricid snail Murex margaritensis, the trumpet triton Charonia variegata and the tulip snail Fasciolaria tulipa. Crustaceans are also conch predators, {{such as the}} blue crab Callinectes sapidus, the box crab Calappa gallus, the giant <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> Petrochirus diogenes, the spiny lobster Panulirus argus and others. Sea stars, vertebrates, including fish (such as the permit Trachinotus falcatus and the porcupine fish Diodon hystrix), loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) and humans also dine on the queen conch.|$|E
25|$|The second group, {{the land}} hermit crabs, {{spend most of}} their life on land as {{terrestrial}} species in tropical areas, though even they require access to both freshwater and saltwater to keep their gills damp or wet to survive and to reproduce. They belong to the family Coenobitidae. Of the approximately 15 terrestrial species of genus Coenobita in the world, the following are commonly kept as pets: Caribbean <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> (Coenobita clypeatus), Australian land <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> (Coenobita variabilis), and the Ecuadorian <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> (Coenobita compressus). Other species, such as Coenobita brevimanus, Coenobita rugosus, Coenobita perlatus or Coenobita cavipes, are less common but growing in availability and popularity as pets.|$|E

2500|$|As <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> grow, {{they require}} larger shells. Since {{suitable}} intact gastropod shells are sometimes a limited resource, vigorous competition often occurs among <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> for shells. The availability of empty shells {{at any given}} place depends on the relative abundance of gastropods and <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs,</b> matched for size. An equally important issue is the population of organisms that prey upon gastropods and leave the shells intact. <b>Hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> kept together may fight or kill a competitor {{to gain access to}} the shell they favour. However, if the crabs vary significantly in size, the occurrence of fights over empty shells will decrease or remain nonexistent. [...] <b>Hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> with too-small shells cannot grow as fast as those with well-fitting shells, and are more likely to be eaten if they cannot retract completely into the shell.|$|R
50|$|Pagurapseudidae is {{a family}} of {{crustaceans}} in the order Tanaidacea. Like <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs,</b> they inhabit empty gastropod shells, but can be told apart from <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> {{by the lack of}} a carapace, revealing the segmentation of the thorax, and by the greater number of legs: <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> have five pairs of legs, of which the first has large claws, and the last is highly reduced, while in Pagurapseudidae, there is one pair of claws, plus six further walking legs.|$|R
50|$|King crabs are {{generally}} {{thought to be}} derived from hermit crab-like ancestors, which may explain the asymmetry still found in the adult forms. This ancestry is supported by several anatomical peculiarities which are present only in king <b>crabs</b> and <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs.</b> Although some doubt still exists about this theory, king crabs are the most widely quoted example of carcinisation among the Decapoda. The evidence for this explanation comes from the asymmetry of the king crab's abdomen, which is thought to reflect the asymmetry of <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs,</b> which must fit into a spiral shell. Although formerly classified among the <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> in the superfamily Paguroidea, king crabs are now placed in a separate superfamily, Lithodoidea. This is not without controversy as there is a widespread consensus in the scientific community that king crabs are derived from <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> and closely related to pagurid <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs,</b> and therefore a separate superfamily in the classification poorly reflects the phylogenetic relationship of this taxon.|$|R
25|$|Most of the {{approximately}} 1100 species possess an asymmetrical abdomen that is concealed in a scavenged mollusc shell carried around by the <b>hermit</b> <b>crab.</b>|$|E
25|$|The sand of {{the beaches}} is dominantly white or golden, {{although}} some zones of black sand remain under the white sand. On the semi-submerged rocks, crabs can be found: Ghost crab (Ocypode quadrata), <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> (Pagurus bernhardus), Sally lightfoot (Grapsus grapsus).|$|E
25|$|The young {{develop in}} stages, {{with the first}} two (the nauplius and protozoea) {{occurring}} inside the egg. Most <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> larvae hatch at the third stage, the zoea. In this larval stage, the crab has several long spines, a long, narrow abdomen, and large fringed antennae. Several zoeal moults are followed by the final larval stage, the megalopa.|$|E
5000|$|S domuncula is {{well known}} for colonizing {{gastropod}} shells occupied by <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs.</b> At least 13 species of <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> have been found associated with this sponge. It has also been recorded attached to the shells of live gastropods and the carapace of other crustaceans.|$|R

25|$|The post-larva is characterised {{by the use}} of {{abdominal}} appendages (pleopods) for propulsion. The post-larva {{is usually}} similar to the adult form, and so many names have been erected for the stage in different groups. William Elford Leach erected the genus Megalopa in 1813 for a post-larval crab; a shrimp post-larva is called a parva; <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> post-larva are called glaucothoe.|$|E

One particularly interesting fish is the mudskipper, a gobioid that {{climbs out of the}} water into mudflats and even climbs trees.|$|E
25|$|In 1967, {{a second}} species of fly, Drosophila endobranchia was {{discovered}} on Gecarcinus ruricola, although it also inhabits the {{closely related species}} Gecarcinus lateralis. Drosohila endrobranchia is not closely related to D. carcinophila, and this trait appears therefore to have evolved convergently. (A third species of fly, Lissocephala powelli has evolved a similar habit on Christmas Island, where it lives on the land crabs Gecarcoidea lalandii, Geograpsus crinipes and Cardisoma carnifex, and the terrestrial <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> Birgus latro.) D. endobranchia evolved {{from a group of}} species which breed on fungi or bark, while D. carcinophila evolved from a group which breed on cacti.|$|E
25|$|The {{fossil record}} of in situ <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> using {{gastropod}} shells stretches {{back to the}} Late Cretaceous.

25|$|Most {{species have}} long, spirally curved abdomens, which are soft, unlike the hard, calcified abdomens seen in related crustaceans. The {{vulnerable}} abdomen is protected from predators by a salvaged empty seashell {{carried by the}} <b>hermit</b> <b>crab,</b> into which its whole body can retract. Most frequently, hermit crabs use the shells of sea snails (although the shells of bivalves and scaphopods and even hollow pieces of wood and stone are used by some species). The tip of the hermit crab's abdomen is adapted to clasp strongly onto the columella of the snail shell. Most hermit crabs are nocturnal.|$|E
25|$|Discarding {{affects the}} {{environment}} in two ways; firstly, through increased mortality to target and non-target species, particularly at juvenile life-history stages, and secondly, through alteration of food webs by supplying increased levels of food to scavenging organisms on the sea floor, and to sea birds. The survival of discarded fish and invertebrates is variable and depends on species and fishing gear used. For example, species such as the Pacific halibut caught in long-line fisheries in the Bering Sea, or lesser spotted dogfish in beam trawls in the English Channel have survival rates of between 88-98%. Survival rates of roundfish discards are significantly lower, and this mortality is included in most International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) stock assessments. Crustaceans {{are thought to be}} more hardy, though survival of crustaceans is variable; for instance, a survival rate of 25% is assumed for Nephrops norvegicus, the Norway Lobster, whilst survival rates of almost 100% have been demonstrated for the <b>hermit</b> <b>crab,</b> Pagurus bernhardus.|$|E
500|$|Sea anemones produce toxins, such as calitoxin, {{in their}} {{stinging}} cells (cnidocytes). [...] These cells contain organelles called nematocysts. [...] When triggered, an envenomation response occurs. This {{can result in}} injury to target organisms, including capture of prey, defense against predatory organisms, or against aggressors from within their own species. In its natural setting, C.parasitica can establish a mutualistic relationship with the <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> Pagurus bernhardus. [...] The sea anemone identifies shells inhabited by the <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> and attaches. [...] C.parasitica provides protection for the <b>hermit</b> <b>crab,</b> by stinging or intimidating potential predators. [...] Octopuses will avoid shells bearing C.parasitica. [...] In return for the protection, the sea anemone gains an advantage in accessing a broader distribution of food sources, as the crab moves across the ocean floor.|$|E

500|$|Although Birgus latro is a {{derived type}} of <b>hermit</b> <b>crab,</b> only the juveniles use {{salvaged}} snail shells {{to protect their}} soft abdomens, and adolescents sometimes use broken coconut shells for that purpose. Unlike other hermit crabs, the adult coconut crabs do not carry shells but instead harden their abdominal terga by depositing chitin and chalk. Not being constrained by the physical confines {{of living in a}} shell allows this species to grow much larger than other hermit crabs in the family Coenobitidae. Like most true crabs, B.latro bends its tail underneath its body for protection. The hardened abdomen protects the coconut crab and reduces water loss on land, but has to be moulted periodically. Adults moult annually, and dig a burrow up to [...] long in which to hide while vulnerable. It remains in the burrow for 3 to 16 weeks, {{depending on the size of}} the animal.
