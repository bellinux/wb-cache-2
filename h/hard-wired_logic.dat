40|$|Abstract. Since its {{proposal}} by Victor Miller [17] and Neal Koblitz [15] {{in the mid}} 1980 s, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) {{has evolved into a}} mature public-key cryptosystem. Offering the smallest key size and the highest strength per bit, its computational efficiency can benefit both client devices and server machines. We have designed a programmable hardware accelerator to speed up point multiplication for elliptic curves over binary polynomial fields GF (2 m). The accelerator is based on a scalable architecture capable of handling curves of arbitrary field degrees up to m = 255. In addition, it delivers optimized performance for a set of commonly used curves through <b>hard-wired</b> reduction <b>logic.</b> A prototype implementation running in a Xilinx XCV 2000 E FPGA at 66. 4 MHz shows a performance of 6987 point multiplications per second for GF (2 163).

40|$|Intense {{research}} on virtual machines has highlighted {{the need for}} flexible software architectures that allow quick evaluation of new design and implementation techniques. The interface between the compiler and runtime system is a principal factor in the flexibility of both components and is critical to enabling rapid pursuit of new optimizations and features. Although many virtual machines have demonstrated modularity for many components, significant dependencies often remain between the compiler and the runtime system components such as the object model and memory management system. This paper addresses this challenge with a carefully designed strict compiler-runtime interface and the XIR language. Instead of the compiler backend lowering object operations to machine operations using <b>hard-wired</b> runtimespecific <b>logic,</b> XIR allows the runtime system to implement this logic, simultaneously simplifying and separating the backend from runtime-system details. In this paper we describe the design and implementation of this compiler-runtime interface and the XIR language in the C 1 X dynamic compiler, a port of the HotSpot TM Client compiler. Our results show {{a significant reduction in}} backend complexity with XIR and an overall reduction in the compiler-runtime interface complexity while still generating comparable quality code with only minor impact on compilation time...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} narrow the speed and density gap between FPGAs and MPGAs we propose the {{development}} of “families” of FPGAs.

Any given application circuit is implemented in the sibling with the most appropriate architecture. With properly chosen siblings, one can develop a family of FPGAs which will have better speed and density than any single FPGA. We apply this concept to create two different FPGA families, one composed of architectures with different types of <b>hard-wired</b> <b>logic</b> blocks and the other created from architectures with different types of heterogeneous logic blocks.

Moreover, as compared to conventional digital approaches based on analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and digital pulsewidth modulators (DPWMs), the phase-lag due to the uniformly sampled DPWM and due to the output voltage sampling is avoided, thus improving phased margin at the crossover frequency where the derivative contribution is usually prevailing. This property potentially enables faster controllers with improved dynamic response, breaking bandwidth limitation of conventional digital control architectures. The proposed control architecture is also effective from the IC point of view, since it is based on a DAC, a simple analog front-end, including a sample and hold, a comparator and an operational amplifier, and low digital signal-processing requirement (~ 5000 gates).

40|$|Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is an allohexaploid hybrid {{composed}} of three closely related diploid subgenomes (AABBDD, 2 n= 6 x= 42). For most genes, bread wheat therefore has three gene copies, {{referred to as}} homeolog triplets. Normally {{there is no need}} for maintaining several copies of a gene performing the same function. This means that two of the copies are free to evolve, leading to diverged gene expression between homeologs. Previous studies have found that in some of the triplets there is differential expression between homeologs, but which subgenome that is preferentially expressed varies between tissues. However, no one has really focused on developmental regulation of the subgenomes, which is the main topic of this thesis. In this thesis two RNA-seq datasets from different tissues and developmental stages were used to investigate subgenome divergence both in steady state expression levels, and in developmental regulation through tests for temporal changes in expression within tissues. The proportion of homeologous genes with differential expression between pairs of subgenomes varied from 25 % to 50 % depending on the tissue. In all tissues, the largest number of differentially expressed homeologs was between the A and B subgenomes. This suggests that these two subgenomes are least related, thereby confirming previous results regarding the evolutionary history of bread wheat. Interestingly, although the expression levels varied between homeologs on different subgenomes, the developmental regulation was very similar. For example, a triplet could have significantly higher leaf expression in the D subgenome compared to the A and B subgenomes, while still exhibiting significant up-regulation in all subgenomes from one time point to the next during leaf development. The highly similar regulation of bread wheat subgenomes demonstrated in this thesis, coupled with the fact that subgenome expression levels often are highly variable, suggests that epigenetic regulation is a more important mechanism underlying subgenome specific differences in expression levels, compared to regulatory <b>logics</b> <b>hard-wired</b> in the DNA...|$|R

In 1975, Fanuc possessed a stable technology and a dominant share of the NC market, based on its hard-wired NC system: the logic unit implemented with transistors, diodes, and other integrated circuits. In this system, however, at each run of the work process, a paper-tape has to be mounted into the tape-reading device. For example, 100 mountings into the reader has to be repeated in order to process 100  units of works. It is obvious, therefore, that this system is not viable since the paper tape will wear out after 100 repetitions. In contrast, the use of MPUs means that logic operations are carried out by software. Therefore, if the soft-wired NC becomes available, it would mark a significant transition.|$|E
