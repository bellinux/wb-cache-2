50|$|Forced {{heirship}} {{is a form}} of testate partible inheritance {{whereby the}} estate of a deceased (<b>de</b> <b>cujus)</b> is separated into (1) an indefeasible portion, the forced estate (Germ Pflichtteil, Fr réserve, It, legittima, Sp legítima), passing to the deceased's next-of-kin (conjunctissimi), and (2) a discretionary portion, or free estate (Germ frei verfügbare Quote, Fr quotité disponible, It quota disponible, Sp tercio de libre disposición), to be freely disposed of by will. Forced heirship is generally a feature of civil-law legal systems which do not recognize total freedom of testation. Normally, the deceased's estate is in-gathered and wound up without discharging liabilities, which means accepting inheritance includes accepting the liabilities attached to inherited property. The forced estate is divided into shares which include the share of issue (legitime or child's share) and the spousal share. This provides a minimum protection that cannot be defeated by will. The free estate, on the other hand, is at the discretion of a testator to be distributed by will on death to whomever he or she chooses. Takers in the forced estate are known as forced heirs (Germ Pflichtteilserben, Noterben, Fr réservataires, It legittimari, Sp herederos forzosos).|$|E
40|$|A natural person’s {{patrimony}} consists, {{apart from}} rights (assets of the succession), of a liabilities {{side as well}} related to obligations that the patrimony’s holder bequeaths onto the heirs following his/her death. The succession implies {{that there are two}} parties, i. e. the assets of the succession and the inherited debt. The inherited debt is mainly made up of the inheritance duties and liabilities. The main components of the inherited debt are the debts the deceased has left, following that the duties shall be the obligations arising out after the succession will be opened. However, without defining the inherited debt concept in the specialized literature, successional liabilities have been considered to mean those patrimonial obligations of the deceased toward a third party or the inheritors existing in the successional patrimony on the opening of succession, regardless of their origin (contractual, tortious or legal). Inheritance duties refer to those obligations which did not exist in the <b>de</b> <b>cujus</b> patrimony, but come into existence devolving upon the heirs on the date of succession’s opening or subsequently after that time, either in consequence of the deceased’s desire, or independently of it. The main characteristic of the option on succession is that the right of option belongs exclusively to the presumptive heirs. From this point of view, the option on succession seems to have nothing in common with the inherited debt. Nevertheless, I intend to analyse the correlation between the two institutions {{from the perspective of the}} place inheritance creditors hold in the totality of rights of option. Their presence is only justified when there is an inherited debt...|$|E
