Stones sponsored the Rugby Football League Championship and its successor the Rugby Super League throughout the 1980s and 1990s.|$|E
5000|$|Its {{predisposition}} to monastic institutionalization throughout the empire allowed <b>it</b> to <b>eventually</b> assimilate and co-opt Taoist perspectives. The {{dominance of the}} Ch’an Buddhist tradition was most responsible for this trend. However, when <b>it</b> was <b>eventually</b> exported to Japan, the Taoist strands had the opportunity in a new cultural framework to once again assert themselves.|$|R

5|$|The Mayflower first {{anchored}} in {{what became the}} harbor of Provincetown, Massachusetts on November 11, 1620.

5|$|A {{persistent}} {{shortage of}} coinage {{in all of}} the colonies prompted Massachusetts to establish a mint on May 27, 1652, and begin production of coins from its silver reserves. This act solved a practical problem, but the colony had no authority to do so from the crown. Although this did not become an issue while Endecott was governor, <b>it</b> <b>eventually</b> became a source of controversy with the crown, and the mint had apparently ceased operations around 1682.|$|E
5|$|Although Spiderland was {{not widely}} {{recognized}} on its initial release, <b>it</b> <b>eventually</b> {{sold more than}} 50,000 copies and became a landmark album in underground music after Slint broke up. The album has been influential on the styles of many bands in the post-rock and math rock genres.

50|$|Halévy {{worked on}} the opera during his last years (1858-1862), but left it {{unfinished}} after the Paris Opéra, which had scheduled it for the 1860 season, decided to postpone it after seeing the score of the first four acts. <b>It</b> was <b>eventually</b> completed by Halévy's son-in-law, Georges Bizet, who however was unable to persuade any theatre to put <b>it</b> on. <b>Eventually</b> <b>it</b> was premiered in Karlsruhe in 1885, ten years after Bizet's own death. It is sometimes known by the title suggested by Bizet, Le déluge (The Flood).|$|R
5|$|Another way of {{estimating}} {{the age of}} the cluster is by looking at the lowest-mass objects. In normal main-sequence stars, lithium is rapidly destroyed in nuclear fusion reactions. Brown dwarfs can retain their lithium, however. Due to lithium's very low ignition temperature of 2.5 × 106 K, the highest-mass brown dwarfs will burn <b>it</b> <b>eventually,</b> and so determining the highest mass of brown dwarfs still containing lithium in the cluster can give an idea of its age. Applying this technique to the Pleiades gives an age of about 115 million years.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of {{reforming}} actions such as the Bill of Middlesex, the Common Pleas became increasingly conservative and resistant to King's Bench changes because of the impact they had on {{the business of the}} Common Pleas. This was best emphasised by Slade's Case, a struggle between the old and new forms of suing for breach of contract; although an equilibrium between the common law courts was finally reached, <b>it</b> <b>eventually</b> led to their dissolution with the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873, and merger into a single High Court of Justice.|$|E
5|$|Bordallo reintroduced it, as amended, at the {{beginning}} of the next Congress. It gained 30 cosponsors, bypassed the committee stage and was passed by voice vote in March 2009.

The Senate Subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries and Coast Guard held hearings on the bill in June.|$|E

5|$|Bringing up Baby was a {{commercial}} flop upon its release, although <b>it</b> <b>eventually</b> {{made a small}} profit after its re-release in the early 1940s. Shortly after the film's premiere, Hepburn was infamously labeled box-office poison by the Independent Theatre Owners of America and would not regain her success until The Philadelphia Story two years later. The film's reputation began to grow during the 1950s, when it was shown on television.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the Tu-80 {{began in}} November 1948, using as many Tu-4 {{components}} {{as possible to}} speed up construction, but the first flight was not until 1 December 1949, after the Council of Ministers had canceled the program on 16 September 1949 {{in favor of the}} Tu-85 which was expected to have much better performance. The Tu-80 became a research aircraft, testing reversible-pitch propellers and structural deformation in heavy aircraft. <b>It</b> <b>eventually</b> became a target on a bombing and gunnery range.|$|E
5|$|Countdown to Extinction {{received}} {{positive reaction}} from music critics, who noted its politically oriented lyrics and simplified sound {{in comparison to}} their previous record.

The record was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 1993 Grammy Awards, while the album's title track won the Humane Society's Genesis Award for raising awareness for animal rights issues.|$|E

5|$|Critics {{acknowledge}} Super Mario 64 {{as a key}} {{contributor to}} the anticipation, and initial success, of the Nintendo 64 console. Though the system was initially very successful, <b>it</b> <b>eventually</b> {{lost much of its}} market share to Sony's PlayStation. 1UP.com attributed this decline to Nintendo's use of cartridges and the design of the Nintendo 64 controller, which were reportedly implemented by Miyamoto for Super Mario 64.|$|E
5|$|Crosby's number 87 Pittsburgh Penguins jersey {{was the top}} seller on the NHL's website from September 2005 to February 2008. In January 2005, an Air Canada {{baggage handler}} in Montreal stole Crosby's red Canada jersey from the World Junior Hockey Championship. It was {{recovered}} later in a mailbox.

5|$|Dancers in the United Kingdom {{have had}} success in hip-hop theater. In 2006, hip-hop dance company Boy Blue Entertainment won a Laurence Olivier Award for their show Pied Piper.

According to Clemente, the future of hip-hop dance is in theater; he {{believes}} it is necessary for the dance to make this transition in order for it to be legitimized as an art form.|$|E
