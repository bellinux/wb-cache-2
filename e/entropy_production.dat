40|$|Abstract. A new {{approach}} {{to the construction of}} <b>entropies</b> and <b>entropy</b> <b>productions</b> for a large class of nonlinear evolutionary PDEs of even order in one space dimension is presented. The task of proving entropy dissipation is reformulated as a decision problem for polynomial systems. The method is successfully applied to the porous medium equation, the thin film equation, and the quantum drift-diffusion model. In all cases, an infinite number of entropy functionals together with the associated <b>entropy</b> <b>productions</b> is derived. Our technique can be extended to higher-order entropies, containing derivatives of the solution, and to several space dimensions. Furthermore, logarithmic Sobolev inequalities can be obtained.

40|$|The kinetic {{modeling}} and simulation of reactive flows, especially for those with detonation, are further investigated. From the theoretical side, {{a new set of}} hydrodynamic equations are deduced, where the viscous stress tensor and heat flux are replaced by two non-equilibrium quantities that have been defined in our previous work. The two non-equilibrium quantities are referred to as NonOrganized Momentum Flux (NOMF) and Non-Organized Energy Flux (NOEF), respectively, here. The numerical results of viscous stress (heat flux) have a good agreement with those of NOMF (NOEF) near equilibrium state. Around sharp interfaces, the values of NOMF (NOEF) deviate reasonably from those of viscous stress (heat flux). Based on this hydrodynamic model, the relations between the two non-equilibrium quantities and <b>entropy</b> <b>productions</b> are established. Based on the discrete Boltzmann model, four kinds of detonation phenomena with different reaction rates, including Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) regime, are simulated and investigated. The differences of the four kinds of detonations are studied from three aspects: hydrodynamic quantities, non-equilibrium quantities and <b>entropy</b> <b>productions.</b> Comment: 30 pages, 12 figure...|$|R

25|$|Nevertheless, the {{principle}} of detailed balance is not necessary for entropy growth. For example, in the linear irreversible cycle A1 -> A2 -> A3 -> A1, <b>entropy</b> <b>production</b> is positive but {{the principle}} of detailed balance does not hold.|$|E
25|$|The second law of {{thermodynamics}} is {{an expression}} of the universal principle of decay observable in nature. The second law is an observation of the fact that over time, differences in temperature, pressure, and chemical potential tend to even out in a physical system that is isolated from the outside world. Entropy is a measure of how much this process has progressed. The entropy of an isolated system which is not in equilibrium will tend to increase over time, approaching a maximum value at equilibrium. However, principles guiding systems that are far from equilibrium are still debatable. One of such principles is the maximum <b>entropy</b> <b>production</b> principle. It states that non-equilibrium systems behave {{such a way as to}} maximize its <b>entropy</b> <b>production.</b>|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{irreversible}} processes {{that result in}} an increase of the entropy.

The mixing is accompanied by the entropy of mixing. In the important case of mixing of ideal gases, the combined system does not change its internal energy by work or heat transfer; the entropy increase is then entirely due to the spreading of the different substances into their new common volume.|$|E

Some {{of the most difficult}} problems concerning the origin of life, such as enzyme-less replication of RNA and DNA, homochirality of the fundamental molecules, and the origin of information encoding in RNA and DNA, also find an explanation within the same dissipative thermodynamic framework by considering the probable existence of a relation between primordial replication and UV-C photon dissipation.

In this paper we try to explain the emergent behavior of a simulated swarm by applying methods based on the fluctuation theorem.

Individuals of the swarm are able to locally detect fluctuations of the global entropy measure and store them, if they are negative <b>entropy</b> <b>productions.</b> By accumulating these stored fluctuations over time the swarm as a whole is producing negative entropy and the system ends up in an ordered state.

2500|$|The 19th-century Austrian {{physicist}} Ludwig Boltzmann first {{recognized that}} the struggle for existence of living organisms was neither over raw material nor energy, but instead {{had to do with}} <b>entropy</b> <b>production</b> derived from the conversion of the solar spectrum into heat by these systems. Boltzmann thus realized that living systems, like all irreversible processes, were dependent on the dissipation of a generalized chemical potential for their existence. In his book “What is Life”, the 20th-century Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger emphasized the importance of Boltzmann’s deep insight into the irreversible thermodynamic nature of living systems, suggesting that this was the physics and chemistry behind the origin and evolution of life. However, irreversible processes, and much less living systems, could not be conveniently analyzed under this perspective until Lars Onsager, and later Ilya Prigogine, developed an elegant mathematical formalism for treating the “self-organization” of material under a generalized chemical potential. This formalism became known as Classical Irreversible Thermodynamics and Prigogine was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1977 [...] "for his contributions to non-equilibrium thermodynamics, particularly the theory of dissipative structures". The analysis of Prigogine showed that if a system were left to evolve under an imposed external potential, material could spontaneously organize (lower its entropy) forming what he called “dissipative structures” which would increase the dissipation of the externally imposed potential (augment the global <b>entropy</b> <b>production).</b> Non-equilibrium thermodynamics has since been successfully applied to the analysis of living systems, from the biochemical production of ATP [...] to optimizing bacterial metabolic pathways [...] to complete ecosystems.|$|E
2500|$|In his “Thermodynamic Dissipation Theory of the Origin and Evolution of Life”, Karo Michaelian {{has taken}} the insight of Boltzmann {{and the work of}} Prigogine to its {{ultimate}} consequences regarding the origin of life. This theory postulates that the hallmark of the origin and evolution of life is the microscopic dissipative structuring of organic pigments and their proliferation over the entire Earth surface. Present day life augments the <b>entropy</b> <b>production</b> of Earth in its solar environment by dissipating ultraviolet and visible photons into heat through organic pigments in water. This heat then catalyzes a host of secondary dissipative processes such as the water cycle, ocean and wind currents, hurricanes, etc. Michaelian argues that if the thermodynamic function of life today is to produce entropy through photon dissipation in organic pigments, then this probably was its function at its very beginnings. It turns out that both RNA and DNA when in water solution are very strong absorbers and extremely rapid dissipaters of ultraviolet light within the 230–290nm wavelength (UV-C) region, which {{is a part of the}} Sun's spectrum that could have penetrated the prebiotic atmosphere. In fact, not only RNA and DNA, but many fundamental molecules of life (those common to all three domains of life) are also pigments that absorb in the UV-C, and many of these also have a chemical affinity to RNA and DNA. Nucleic acids may thus have acted as acceptor molecules to the UV-C photon excited antenna pigment donor molecules by providing an ultrafast channel for dissipation. Michaelian has shown using the formalism of non-linear irreversible thermodynamics that there would have existed during the Archean a thermodynamic imperative to the abiogenic UV-C photochemical synthesis and proliferation of these pigments over the entire Earth surface if they acted as catalysts to augment the dissipation of the solar photons. By the end of the Archean, with life-induced ozone dissipating UV-C light in the Earth’s upper atmosphere, it would have become ever more improbable for a completely new life to emerge that didn’t rely on the complex metabolic pathways already existing since now the free energy in the photons arriving at Earth’s surface would have been insufficient for direct breaking and remaking of covalent bonds. It has been suggested, however, that such changes in the surface flux of ultraviolet radiation due to geophysical events affecting the atmosphere could have been what promoted the development of complexity in life based on existing metabolic pathways, for example during the Cambrian explosion ...|$|E
