The leading sources of immigrants to Canada were China, the Philippines and India. According to Statistics Canada, visible minority groups could account for a third of the Canadian population by 2031.|$|E

25|$|Individuals and {{organizations}} have designed numerous ways to measure performance {{and continue to}} do so at an increasing rate. Evidence for this observation can be found by tracking changes in performance measures over time. In the 19th century, companies measured their performance via industry-specific output and cost measures, such as newspaper circulation. By the 1920s, companies also began utilizing accounting-based returns measures, such as return on investment. And the 1960s and 1970s saw the emergence of purely financial measures of performance relating information on dividends and return on equity. This dependence on performance measures has not diminished in recent years – on the contrary, the number of metrics that exist <b>is</b> <b>growing</b> <b>at</b> an even more accelerated rate. Today, in addition to financial measures, organizations examine nonfinancial metrics regarding leadership, information, planning, human resource utilization, and customer satisfaction.
