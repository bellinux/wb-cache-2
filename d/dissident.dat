5|$|<b>Dissident</b> {{success was}} mixed. Jews wanting to emigrate from the Soviet Union in the 1970s formed the most successful, and most organised, <b>dissident</b> movement. Their {{success can be}} {{attributed}} to the movement's support abroad, most notably from the Jewish community in the United States. In addition, as a group they were not advocating a transformation of Soviet society; the Jewish <b>dissident</b> movement was simply interested in leaving the Soviet Union for Israel. The Soviet Government subsequently sought to improve diplomatic ties with the First World by allowing the Jews to emigrate. The emigration flow was reduced dramatically as Soviet–American tension increased in the later half of the 1970s, though it was revived somewhat in 1979, peaking at 50,000. In the early 1980s, however, the Soviet leadership decided to block emigration completely. Despite official claims that anti-Semitism was a bourgeois ideology incompatible with socialism, the truth was that Jews who openly practiced their religion or identified as Jewish from a cultural standpoint faced widespread discrimination from the Soviet system.|$|E

50|$|In 2004, Cuba {{released}} 14 of the <b>dissidents</b> and an EU {{working group}} on Latin America recommended the policy be changed instead to promoting more discreet contacts with <b>dissidents.</b> After 20 months of tense relations, Brussels compromised by stating it would not ask Cubans to its diplomatic functions in future, be they <b>dissidents</b> or government ministers, rendering receptions useless as a diplomatic tool.|$|R
5|$|In May 1970, {{the crews}} of two Cuban fishing boats were kidnapped by Florida-based <b>dissident</b> group Alpha 66, who demanded that Cuba release imprisoned militants. Under U.S. pressure, the hostages were released, and Castro welcomed them back as heroes. In April 1971, Castro was internationally {{condemned}} for ordering {{the arrest of}} <b>dissident</b> poet Heberto Padilla; Padilla was freed, but the government established the National Cultural Council to ensure that intellectuals and artists supported the administration.|$|E

5|$|For the sejm of 1606 {{the royal}} faction, hoping to take {{advantage}} of the glorious Battle of Kircholm victory and other successes, submitted a more comprehensive constructive reform program. Instead the sejm had become preoccupied with the <b>dissident</b> postulate of prosecuting instigators of religious disturbances directed against non-Catholics; advised by Skarga, the King refused his assent to the proposed statute.|$|E
5000|$|This {{move was}} in protest at Cuba's {{decision}} to imprison 75 <b>dissidents</b> and to execute 3 hijackers. The Cuban government, which calls its <b>dissidents</b> [...] "mercenaries in {{the pay of}} the United States", took this as an insult and cut off almost all diplomatic relations with all European Union ambassadors and their embassies despite few <b>dissidents</b> willing to risk turning up to the events.|$|R
50|$|Ibero-American Summit <b>Dissidents</b> (1999) - About a dozen {{opposition}} groups claiming peaceful opposition to Castro's one-party state urged Ibero-American leaders to back their cause. 40 <b>dissidents</b> planning the gathering {{were arrested in}} Havana before the Ibero-American Summit.|$|R

5|$|In 1978, {{the book}} I Vozvrashchaetsa Veter... (And the Wind Returns...) by Vladimir Bukovsky, {{describing}} the <b>dissident</b> movement, their struggle or freedom, practices {{of dealing with}} dissenters, and dozen years spent by Bukovsky in Soviet labor camps, prisons and psychiatric hospitals, was published and later translated into English under the title To Build a Castle: My Life as a Dissenter.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, {{together}} with Cuban <b>dissident</b> Armando Valladares, Bukovsky co-founded {{and was later}} elected president of Resistance International. The anti-Communist organisation was run from a small office in Paris by Soviet dissidents and emigres, notably Vladimir Maximov and Eduard Kuznetsov. In 1985 it expanded into the American Foundation for Resistance International. Among the prominent {{members of the board}} were Albert Jolis and Jeane Kirkpatrick while Midge Decter, Yuri Yarim-Agaev, Richard Perle, Saul Bellow, Robert Conquest and Martin Colman were on the body's advisory committee. The Foundation aimed to be a coordinating centre for <b>dissident</b> and democratic movements seeking to overturn communism in Eastern Europe and elsewhere. It organised protests in the communist countries and in the West, and opposed western financial assistance to communist governments. The Foundation also created the National Council to Support Democratic Movements (National Council for Democracy) with the goal of aiding the emergence of democratic rule-of-law governments, and providing assistance with the writing of constitutions and the formation of civil institutions.|$|E
5|$|In August 2013 the Irish republican <b>dissident</b> group Óglaigh na hÉireann {{was blamed}} for {{planting}} a Katyusha-style rocket in undergrowth {{next to a}} field near Cullyhanna in South Armagh in an area used by soldiers on training exercises. The weapon was to be triggered using a mobile phone.|$|E
50|$|In 1979, {{with the}} {{contribution}} of his wife, Plyushch published his book History's Carnival: A <b>Dissident's</b> Autobiography in which he described how he and other <b>dissidents</b> were committed to psychiatric hospitals. At the same year, the book was translated into English. In 1980, Andrei Snezhnevsky, who was a Corresponding Fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatry, was invited by his British colleagues to answer criticism relating to Plyushch and other <b>dissidents.</b> He refused to do so, and instead resigned his Fellowship.|$|R
5|$|In 1979, Leonid Plyushch {{published}} his book Na Karnavale Istorii (At History's Сarnival) {{in which he}} described how he and other <b>dissidents</b> were committed to psychiatric hospitals.

5000|$|... "After the {{collapse}} of the communist regime in late 1989, the new government consisted mainly of former <b>dissidents</b> and some who had not been active dissenters, but had not been active party members either. In comparison with Slovakia, many more Czech <b>dissidents</b> with no previous political or even professional experience were willing to assume not only legislative, but also executive posts (Ucen 1999: 85). Václav Havel provides the most striking example, but quite a few other politically inexperienced former <b>dissidents</b> took important positions, especially within the first few post-1989 governments. Without exaggerating the influence of former <b>dissidents</b> in the post-communist era, I assume that their presence in the government, cabinet, and extragovernmental research does have an (at least limited) impact on policies, as well as public opinion.|$|R
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, Lem {{cautiously}} supported the Polish <b>dissident</b> movement, and started publishing essays in Paris-based Kultura. In 1982, with martial law in Poland declared, Lem moved to West Berlin, {{where he became}} {{a fellow of the}} Institute for Advanced Study, Berlin (Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin). After that, he settled in Vienna. He returned to Poland in 1988.|$|E
5|$|On 6 January 1929, King Alexander {{dissolved}} {{the government}} and introduced a royal dictatorship over the newly created Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Because he {{was viewed as a}} <b>dissident,</b> Lorković was placed under constant police surveillance. On 15 November 1929, a warrant for his arrest was issued, but he succeeded in escaping to Austria and later to Germany.|$|E
5|$|Pussy Riot's {{performances}} {{can either}} be called <b>dissident</b> art or political action that engages art forms.

50|$|Robert Mugabe and ZAPU leader Joshua Nkomo {{signed the}} Unity Accord on 22 December 1987. This {{effectively}} dissolved ZAPU into ZANU, renamed Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF). On 18 April 1988, Mugabe announced an amnesty for all <b>dissidents,</b> and Nkomo called {{on them to}} lay down their arms. A general ordinance was issued saying all those who surrendered before 31 May would get a full pardon. This was extended not just to <b>dissidents</b> but to criminals of various types serving jail terms. Over the next few weeks, 122 <b>dissidents</b> surrendered.|$|R
5|$|The Central Executive Committee of the Congress of Soviets {{issued a}} press decree that let the Bolsheviks {{suppress}} <b>dissident</b> newspapers. After {{the suppression of}} the Golos Truda by the Bolshevik government in August 1918, G.P Maximoff, Nikolai Dolenko and Efim Yartchuk established Volny Golos Truda (The Free Voice of Labour).|$|E
5|$|The rise {{to power}} of the Bolsheviks marked the turning point for the {{newspaper}} however, as the new government enacted increasingly repressive measures against the publication of <b>dissident</b> literature and against anarchist agitation in general, {{and after a few}} years of low-profile publishing, the Golos Truda collective was finally expunged by the Stalinist regime in 1929.|$|E
5|$|Aberhart's {{government}} was re-elected in the 1940 election with a reduced majority of 36 of 63 seats. Among the defeated incumbents were <b>dissident</b> leader Brown, the convicted Unwin, the expelled Barnes, and the Provincial Treasurer Low. Aberhart won re-election by running in Calgary; his replacement as Social Credit candidate in Okotoks–High River was soundly defeated. Aberhart died in 1943 {{and was replaced}} as Premier by Ernest Manning, who steered the Social Credit League in a more conservative and conventional direction until his 1968 retirement.|$|E
50|$|Psychiatric diagnoses such as {{sluggish}} schizophrenia {{were used}} in the USSR for political purposes; the diagnosis of sluggish schizophrenia was most frequently used for Soviet <b>dissidents.</b> Sluggish schizophrenia as a diagnostic category was created to facilitate the stifling of <b>dissidents</b> and was a root of self-deception among psychiatrists to placate their consciences when the doctors acted as a tool of oppression {{in the name of a}} political system. American psychiatrist Peter Breggin points out that the term “sluggish schizophrenia” was created to justify involuntary treatment of political <b>dissidents</b> with drugs normally used for psychiatric patients.|$|R
2500|$|Relations {{between the}} {{countries}} of Ghana and Togo (and between Nkrumah and Olympio) became very tense in 1962 with repeated assassination plots. Assassination attempts on both leaders were blamed on the other. Refugees and political <b>dissidents</b> from Ghana found refuge in Togo, while political <b>dissidents</b> from Togo found refuge in Ghana. After the Togolese Progress Party and the Juvento movement were implicated in a 1961 attempt on Olympio's life, many prominent politicians including Nicolas Grunitzky and Antoine Meatchi left the country and received welcome and support from Ghana. Similarly, political <b>dissidents</b> from Ghana had fled to Togo after attempts on Nkrumah's life. In 1961, Nkrumah warned Olympio of [...] "dangerous international consequences" [...] if the support for <b>dissidents</b> to his rule that were living in Togo did not cease, but Olympio largely ignored the threat.|$|R

5|$|After {{fallout from}} the {{unsuccessful}} Ogaden campaign of the late 1970s, the Barre administration began arresting government and military officials under suspicion {{of participation in the}} abortive 1978 coup d'état. Most of the people who had allegedly helped plot the putsch were summarily executed. However, several officials managed to escape abroad and started to form the first of various <b>dissident</b> groups dedicated to ousting Barre's regime by force.|$|E
5|$|Before dawn on September 13, 1964, {{the ruling}} {{military}} junta of South Vietnam, led by General Nguyễn Khánh, was {{threatened by a}} coup attempt headed by Generals Lâm Văn Phát and Dương Văn Đức, who sent <b>dissident</b> units into the capital Saigon. They captured various key points and announced over national radio {{the overthrow of the}} incumbent regime. With the help of the Americans, Khánh was able to rally support and the coup collapsed the next morning without any casualties.|$|E
5|$|However, poison {{still exists}} as a murderous entity today, {{but it is}} not as popular form of {{conducting}} murder {{as it used to be}} in past times, probably because of the wider range of ways to kill people and other factors that must be taken into consideration.
