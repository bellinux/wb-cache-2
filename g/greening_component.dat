There would be a limited redistribution of funds between Member States. Thirty per cent of the budget would be allocated to a new <b>greening</b> <b>component,</b> which would be problematic in the WTO.

30|$|By {{looking at}} the results, it appears quite evident that {{greening}} deeply impacts on the southern area of FG-BA, while {{it seems to have}} a very marginal effect on the other two areas. Indeed, the few farmers of BO-FE and AN-MC areas, dealing with crop diversification constraints, may either adapt the crop pattern of their farms to the requirements of greening, or maintaining the current pattern without losing a significant amount of their margin. The situation for FG-BA area farmers is very different. They are squeezed between technical problems related to crop pattern adjustments and the possible loss of the <b>greening</b> <b>component</b> of payment, which represents more than one third of the gross margin of wheat cultivation.|$|E
30|$|The <b>greening</b> <b>component</b> {{of direct}} {{payments}} aims at supporting environmental commitments throughout the EU, {{by means of}} introducing additional payments for public goods (e.g., subtraction of CO 2, soil protection, water drainage and quality). These payments are mandatory for Member States (MS) and available to all farmers who voluntarily respect the required environmental commitments. The commitments are relatively easy to apply, as they consist {{in a kind of}} “reinforced” cross-compliance. In this perspective, greening arises as remuneration for the production of public goods, in line with the aim of the Europe 2020 Strategy. The debate on this issue, in particular on its implementation, is very intense (Cooper et al., 2009; Garrod, 2009; Hart and Baldock, 2011).|$|E

40|$|This {{communication}} {{proposes to}} question the use of framing to analyze the last reform of the common agricultural policy of the European Union towards the debate on its <b>greening</b> <b>component.</b> Underlying assumption is {{that this kind of}} conceptual and methodological tools can open the door for deeper understanding of the policy outcomes. In the framework of this research, the last reform of the Common agricultural policy is screened, especially in regard to negotiation and implementation of measures dedicated to environmental protection. Greening is indeed an issue that is used to divide stakeholders: on the one hand, farmers unions showed some reluctance, and on the other hand, environmental NGOs set greening {{at the very heart of}} their positions. At the end of the reform process (2010 - 2013), the same NGOs deplored that the CAP greening failed. From an interest group perspective, it can be inferred that influence of farmers unions on policy-makers has been more effective than the one of environmental NGOs. This communication investigates if this influence differential has something to do with the way these two types of interest groups framed their arguments. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{incorporation}} of on-site wastewater treatment systems is one means {{to meet the}} infrastructure needs of the rapidly expanding urban population. With space at a premium, the existing technologies for on-site systems should be reexamined and adapted to fit {{the needs of the}} urban setting. This study examined the potential to combine the existing wastewater treatment technology of the intermittent media filter with the new architectural trend of green walls, creating a treatment system with minimal spatial footprint and with a built-in urban <b>greening</b> <b>component.</b> A novel vegetated intermittent media filter wall was constructed in Ås, Norway and dosed with domestic greywater for a period of three months. Overall treatment performance and removal trends over the 175 cm filter depth were monitored. Three separate wall sections were constructed to monitor the treatments effects of containing wall material choice and presence of vegetation. Despite a daily dosing rate of nearly 1000 l/m 2 the system achieved average reduction rates of over 95 %, 80 %, 90 %, 30 %, and 69 % for BOD 5, COD, TSS, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus, respectively, as well as approximately two log unit reduction of bacteria indicator E. coli. Examination over the depth of the system showed that most organic (COD) and solids removal takes place in the upper 15 cm, but with a sudden increase in loading a greater removal was seen at lower depths. With regard to nitrification, increased nitrate levels did not appear before 100 cm filter depth, likely suppressed by high organic loading at the surface. The findings suggest that the great filter height associated with the wall design was useful for buffering sudden increases in hydraulic loading, as well as for facilitating nitrification under extreme loading conditions. Wall material with a more permeable construction (geotextile grid) preformed slightly better in the treatment of organics than non-permeable wall material (plastic liner), but confounding variables reduce the confidence in this finding. The vegetated wall section showed the greatest removal rates in almost every parameter measured, especially removal of E. coli. A difference in hydraulic retention times as shown by (NaCl) tracer tests is the likely cause of this phenomenon, rather than the vegetation itself. The significant reduction of constituents of concern using only a small spatial footprint make this system a worthy candidate for further research and development regarding urban wastewater treatment applications...|$|E

40|$|The urban {{green is}} {{currently}} {{at the core}} of scientific interest and policy-making in urban planning. The importance of the urban <b>green</b> <b>component</b> of the European Settlement Map (ESM) increases under the light of the absence of a homogenous layer in such coverage and resolution to be used in urban analysis. The ESM, the first European Map of the built-up, was initially published in July 2014. It is part of the URBA project initiated by the Joint Research Centre and funded by the Directorate-General for Regional and Urban Policy (DG REGIO). In the beginning, the ESM was not intended to provide a green layer. However, the urban green gradually started receiving increasing interest from the users of the ESM.
