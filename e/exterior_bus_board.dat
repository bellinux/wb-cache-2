Hardware programs of power, <b>bus</b> <b>board,</b> signal conditioning circuit and anti-jamming measure are designed. The multithreading technology and measures to prevent wrong data communicating are applied to develop software of the test system. The test system {{can be applied to}} test and debug the photoelectric equipment.
