5|$|Despite these {{economic}} indicators, the Budget presented in August 1974 saw large increases in spending, especially in education. Treasury officials had advised {{a series of}} tax and fee increases, ranging from excise taxes {{to the cost of}} posting a letter; their advice was mostly rejected by Cabinet. The Budget was unsuccessful <b>in</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> inflation and unemployment, and Whitlam introduced large tax cuts in November. He also announced additional spending to help the private sector.|$|E

5|$|The Tories {{had last}} governed Canada under R.B. Bennett, {{who had been}} elected in 1930.

The Liberals won five consecutive majorities between 1935 and 1953. The Liberals {{worked closely with the}} civil service (drawing several of their ministers from those ranks) and their years of dominance saw prosperity.|$|E
5|$|Using the {{financing}} {{secured from the}} Merchant Adventurers, the Colonists bought provisions and obtained passage on two ships: the Mayflower and the Speedwell. They had intended to leave early in 1620, but they were delayed several months due to difficulties <b>in</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Merchant Adventurers, including several changes in plans for the voyage and in financing.

5|$|By July 1923, The Advertiser {{newspaper}} was reporting that Leane's approach over his {{three years at}} the helm had made {{a significant difference in}} the administration of the South Australia Police, explaining that Leane had dispensed with seniority as the basis for promotion, by substituting merit and efficiency, as well as selecting candidates who displayed qualities of sympathy and tact <b>in</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> public. In February 1925, Leane hosted a conference of commissioners of police from around Australia held in Adelaide. Leane actively supported commemorative activities such as Anzac Day and Remembrance Day, and attended unveilings of memorials. In April 1926, Leane relinquished command of the 3rd Infantry Brigade, and was placed on the unattached list. For his military service since 1905, he had also been awarded the Volunteer Officers' Decoration.|$|E
5|$|By late 1989, the Communist Parties of {{the republics}} of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania had largely been {{weakened}} in power. In Nagorno-Karabakh, the intercommunal relations between Armenians and Azerbaijanis had worsened due to violence and pogroms. Gorbachev's policies hastened {{the collapse of the}} Soviet system and many Armenians and Azerbaijanis sought protection by arming themselves with Soviet military weaponry. His preoccupation <b>in</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> numerous demands by the other republics saw the disappearance of vast amounts of assault rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, and other small arms munitions stored in caches throughout Armenia and Azerbaijan.|$|E
5|$|In early 1833, {{medical doctor}} Elias Lönnrot, {{best known for}} {{compiling}} Kalevala, the national epic of Finland, was appointed district physician in Kajaani and was assigned to assist <b>in</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> typhoid and cholera epidemic which was raging during the 1830s. Disease was difficult to treat and he soon fell ill himself with typhus {{at the end of}} February 1833 but recovered. Kajaani was severely affected by famine in 1867-1868 which devastated much of Finland, but the town gradually recovered {{and by the end of}} the century had grown to more than 1200 inhabitants. Kajaani Town Hall was built in 1831, the former City Library in 1852, Kainuu's first elementary school in 1883, and Kajaani Church in 1896 as it grew into a notable settlement.|$|E

5|$|In {{the long}} term, however, the British backed Iraq and {{rejected}} an international {{inquiry into the}} killings, fearing that this may provoke further massacres against Christians. They also did not insist on punishing the offenders, who were now seen as heroes by Iraqis. The official British stance was to defend the Iraqi government for its perseverance and patience <b>in</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> crisis and to attribute the massacres to rogue army units. A report on the battle of Dirabun blames the Assyrians, defends {{the actions of the}} Iraqi Army, and commends Sidqi as a good officer.|$|E

Amy McNulty from Anime News Network praised how Shikamaru's epilogue episodes helps to expand his characterization as he decides to aid Naruto when he becomes the Hokage.

5|$|Once {{the ships}} sailed into port at Canton, they alarmed the Chinese {{residents}} and officials there by discharging cannon fire, {{what they believed}} was a friendly salute since the Chinese merchants had done so when the Portuguese earlier arrived in Malacca. Chinese officials became even more cautious <b>in</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Portuguese, since the deposed King of Malacca had been a loyal tributary to the imperial Ming court. The Portuguese explained that in deposing the Malaccan king, they were helping the Chinese merchants there who were being oppressed under his rule. In {{the eyes of the}} Canton officials, this added further negative speculations about the Portuguese visitors, because private Chinese overseas trade was banned under the current hai jin laws that stated only the Chinese government could conduct foreign trade.|$|E

The Moors launched a general revolt and inflicted a severe defeat on the Byzantines in Thacia in 545. Sergius was recalled, while the army mutinied again, this time under Guntharis, who captured Carthage and installed himself there {{as an independent}} ruler. His usurpation {{did not last long}} as he was assassinated by Artabanes, {{but it was not until}} the arrival of John Troglita in late 546 and his subsequent campaigns that the province was to be pacified and brought again securely under Byzantine imperial control.|$|E
5|$|The 1951–52 {{season was}} less productive, with the West Indies touring Australia. Playing in all five Tests, Harvey scored 261 runs at 26.10 with one half century as Australia won 4–1. Harvey had {{difficulties}} <b>in</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> dual spin bowling combination of Alf Valentine and Sonny Ramadhin, who bowled left arm orthodox and leg spin respectively {{and accounted for}} him six times in the Tests. His only fifty was an 83 in the first innings of the Fourth Test in Melbourne. Australia went on to complete a dramatic one-wicket victory. Harvey had a poor season overall, scoring only 551 first-class runs at 32.41 without managing a single century.|$|E
5|$|The new law was {{met with}} {{considerable}} resistance, especially in the towns and cities, where Tillman had less support. Dozens of clandestine saloons opened, fueled by barrels of illicit liquor, often transported by railroad. Tillman appointed dispensary constables, who tried to seize such shipments, to be frustrated {{by the fact that}} the South Carolina Railroad was in federal receivership, and state authorities could not confiscate goods entrusted to it. All of Tillman's constables were white, placing him at a disadvantage <b>in</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> alcohol trade among African Americans. Some of the constables tried going undercover by blacking their faces like minstrels; later, Tillman hired an African-American detective from Georgia.|$|E

5|$|During {{their attempt}} to escape Nalbina Dungeon, Vaan, Balthier, and Fran {{discovered}} Basch chained in a cage suspended from the ceiling. Though all three were initially suspicious of him (especially Vaan, who blamed him for Reks's death), Basch protested his innocence and told them about his twin. The party decided his story was plausible and released him. After being freed, he made it his mission to protect Ashe and support the resistance. When {{he and his brother}} were reunited, Gabranth was deeply puzzled by Basch's continued ability to hold his head high in spite of his past failures. Basch explained that his vow to defend Ashe had given him purpose and a renewed sense of honor. After the final battle against Vayne, as Noah was dying, he asked Basch to take his place as Larsa's protector. Because it was still widely believed that Basch was dead, he adopted his brother's name and title when he entered Larsa's service. In Revenant Wings, Basch is sent by Larsa to be the Empire's representative <b>in</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Judge of Wings. Basch was voiced by Keith Ferguson in English and by Rikiya Koyama in Japanese. He also appears in Itadaki Street Portable.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{following}} weekend, some 1,000 volunteers were sworn-in {{as part of}} the Citizens' Defence Brigade, a force of special constables raised at Leane's request to augment the police <b>in</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> waterfront dispute. The brigade was based at Fort Largs and was equipped with service rifles and bayonets. The men were quickly posted at the wharves to maintain law and order. During the dispute, Leane slept in an office at the port so that he was on hand to deal with any emergencies. Leane's decision to arm the mostly inexperienced volunteers with bayonets was later criticised in Parliament. The dispute continued on, with major disturbances at Port Adelaide on 14 January 1929 which resulted in many injuries, and another on 17 January. A significant police presence was required at the wharves into 1930 to deal with disturbances and assaults on non-union workers, and Leane personally supervised police operations there on several occasions.|$|E
5|$|The British had {{numerous}} issues <b>in</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> expanding crisis. A defensive battle had been proven unsound by the immense {{amount of time}} and resources expended pursuing a similar course during the twelve year Malayan Emergency that had ended only a few years before, as well as Dutch efforts to quell the Indonesian rebels during the Indonesian War of Independence, but launching an offensive into Indonesian territory to take the initiative would bring the conflict into an all-out war, and this was unacceptable to Cabinet policy-makers. At the same time, an effective solution had to be found that did not cede Malaysia to the Communists, a move that many feared would be the beginning of the 'domino effect' in Asia. The proposal selected as the most effective was presented to the Cabinet in January 1964 by Richard Austen Butler, who recommended that Britain continue fighting without declaring war, with the conflict contained in Borneo, a strategy designed to weary the Indonesians of battle until the necessity of economic reform overcame them and peace was made.|$|E
