40|$|Grätzel {{cells or}} Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs) are {{considered}} one of the most promising methods to convert the sun's energy into electricity due to their low cost and simple technology of production. The Grätzel cell is based on a photosensitizer adsorbed on a low band gap semiconductor. The photosensitizer can be a metal complex or an organic dye. Organic dyes can be produced on a large scale resulting in cheaper dyes than complexes based on rare elements. However, the performance of Grätzel cells based on metal-free, organic dyes is not high enough yet. The dye's performance depends primarily on the electron dynamics. The electron dynamics in Grätzel cells includes electron injection, recombination, and regeneration. Different <b>deactivation</b> <b>processes</b> affect the electron dynamics and the cells’ performance. In this thesis, the electron dynamics was explored by various time-resolved spectroscopic techniques, namely time-correlated single photon counting, streak camera, and femtosecond transient absorption. Using these techniques, new <b>deactivation</b> <b>processes</b> for organic dyes used in DSSCs were uncovered. These processes include photoisomerization, and quenching through complexation with the electrolyte. These <b>deactivation</b> <b>processes</b> affect the performance of organic dyes in Grätzel cells, and should be avoided. For instance, the photoisomerization can compete with the electron injection and produce isomers with unknown performance. Photoisomerization as a general phenomenon in DSSC dyes has not been shown before, but is shown to occur in several organic dyes, among them D 149, D 102, L 0 and L 0 Br. In addition, D 149 forms ground state complexes with the standard iodide/triiodide electrolyte, which directly affect the electron dynamics on TiO 2. Also, new dyes were designed with the aim of using ferrocene(s) as intramolecular regenerators, and their dynamics was studied by transient absorption. This thesis provides deeper insights into some <b>deactivation</b> <b>processes</b> of organic dyes used in DSSCs. New rules for the design of organic dyes, based on these insights, can further improve the efficiency of DSSCs. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to develop an HT methodology to enable kinetic modeling of diverse catalysts. The reaction of o-xylene hydrogenation is selected as a probe reaction to evaluate the ‘‘metallic'' features of a library of about 80 diverse bimetallic catalysts. A major issue to overcome is deactivation phenomena which are catalyst dependent and which cannot a priori be predicted. A prerequisite is therefore to handle correctly <b>deactivation</b> <b>processes</b> for accessing intrinsic kinetic parameters. For this purpose, an adapted screening strategy is developed, using a proprietary 16 channels multi-tubular reactor which enables to test catalysts at the same time-on-stream.

5000|$|In chemistry, a pincer ligand {{is a type}} of {{chelating}} agent that binds tightly to three adjacent coplanar sites, usually on a transition metal in a meridional configuration. [...] The inflexibility of the pincer-metal interaction confers high thermal stability to the resulting complexes. This stability is in part ascribed to the constrained geometry of the pincer, which inhibits cyclometallation of the organic substituents on the donor sites at each end. In the absence of this effect, cyclometallation is often a significant <b>deactivation</b> <b>process</b> for complexes, in particular limiting their ability to effect C-H bond activation. The organic substituents also define a hydrophobic pocket around the reactive coordination site. Stoichiometric and catalytic applications of pincer complexes have been studied at an accelerating pace since the mid-1970s. Most pincer ligands contain phosphines. [...] Reactions of metal-pincer complexes are localized at three sites perpendicular to the plane of the pincer ligand, although in some cases one arm is hemi-labile and an additional coordination site is generated transiently. Early examples of pincer ligands (not called such originally) were anionic with a carbanion as the central donor site and flanking phosphine donors and are referred to as PCP pincers.|$|E
