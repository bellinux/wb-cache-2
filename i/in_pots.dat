5|$|Cacti {{are often}} grown in greenhouses, {{particularly}} in regions unsuited to {{the cultivation of}} cacti outdoors, such the northern parts of Europe and North America. Here, they may be kept <b>in</b> <b>pots</b> or grown in the ground. Cacti are also grown as houseplants, many being tolerant of the often dry atmosphere. Cacti <b>in</b> <b>pots</b> may be placed outside in the summer to ornament gardens or patios, and then kept under cover during the winter. Less drought-resistant epiphytes, such as epiphyllum hybrids, Schlumbergera (the Thanksgiving or Christmas cactus) and Hatiora (the Easter cactus), are widely cultivated as houseplants.|$|E
5|$|Hippeastrum cultivars {{and species}} {{can be grown}} inside <b>in</b> <b>pots</b> or outside in warmer climates (Hardiness 7B-11). Many will bloom year after year {{provided}} they are given a dormant period in a cool, dark place for two months without water or fertilizer although some bulbs will start growing before the two-month period is up.|$|E
5|$|Cordyline australis {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{cultivated}} New Zealand native trees. In Northwest Europe and other cool oceanic climates, it is very popular as an ornamental tree because it looks like a palm tree. Hardy forms from the coldest areas of the southern or inland South Island tolerate Northern Hemisphere conditions best, while North Island forms are much more tender. It is easily grown from fresh seed — seedlings often spontaneously appear in gardens from bird-dispersed seed — and can be grown very easily from shoot, stem and even trunk cuttings. It does well <b>in</b> <b>pots</b> and tubs.|$|E
50|$|The {{seedings}} {{were assigned}} {{according to the}} Under-17 coefficient ranking. There were three pots, with the ten highest ranked teams <b>in</b> <b>Pot</b> A, the next ten <b>in</b> <b>Pot</b> B and the rest <b>in</b> <b>Pot</b> C.|$|R

5|$|Rice cultivation: In 2002, a Chinese and Japanese group {{reported}} the discovery in eastern China of fossilised phytoliths of domesticated rice apparently {{dating back to}} 11,900 BC or earlier. However, phytolith data are controversial in some quarters due to potential contamination problems. It is likely that demonstrated rice was cultivated in the middle Yangtze Valley by 7000 BC, as shown in finds from the Pengtoushan culture at Bashidang, Changde, Hunan. By 5000 BC, rice had been domesticated at Hemudu culture near the Yangtze Delta and was being cooked <b>in</b> <b>pots.</b> Although millet remained the main crop in northern China throughout history, several sporadic attempts {{were made by the}} state to introduce rice around the Bohai Gulf as early as the 1st century.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd-century-BCE {{tomb of the}} Lady Dai {{contained}} {{not only}} decayed remnants of actual food, such as rice, wheat, barley, two varieties of millet, and soybeans, but also a grave inventory with recipes on it. This included vegetable and meat stews cooked <b>in</b> <b>pots,</b> which had combinations such as beef and rice stew, dog meat and celery stew, and even deer, fish, and bamboo shoot stew. Seasonings mentioned in the recipes include sugar, honey, soy sauce, and salt. Recipes in the Han usually called for meat stuffed in cereals, cakes, and other wrappings.|$|E
25|$|Food was cooked <b>in</b> <b>pots</b> made of {{clay and}} placed on {{earthenware}} stands built in a horseshoe shape, so that the fire could be lit through the opening, under the pot, or pots were suspended above the fire from tripods.|$|E
5000|$|The eight teams, all {{winners of}} the second round, were seeded by their {{performances}} in the CAF competitions for the previous five seasons (CAF 5-Year Ranking points shown in parentheses): two teams <b>in</b> <b>Pot</b> 1, two teams <b>in</b> <b>Pot</b> 2, two teams <b>in</b> <b>Pot</b> 3, and two teams <b>in</b> <b>Pot</b> 4. One team {{from each of the}} four pots were drawn into each group, with each team then assigned a random [...] "position" [...] in the group to determine the fixtures.|$|R

25|$|Sandperches are a family, Pinguipedidae, {{containing}} 63 {{species of}} fishes {{in the order}} Perciformes. They are benthic carnivoures, feeding on small fish and invertebrates. Examples are the redbanded weever, yellow weaver and blue cod. They are often caught <b>in</b> <b>pots</b> like crayfish.|$|E
25|$|Running {{water is}} {{available}} {{in many parts of}} the country, but most villages remain without it. Women in remote areas typically draw water from the nearest well or from a cistern, sometimes walking up to two hours each way twice a day. They may carry the water <b>in</b> <b>pots</b> on their heads or load them onto donkeys.|$|E
25|$|Finely sliced {{meat and}} pork was cooked <b>in</b> <b>pots</b> with semi-traditional porridge. Pies were {{indispensable}} dishes for Christmas, {{as well as}} other holidays, and included both closed and open style pirogi (pirozhki, vatrushkas, coulibiacs, kurnik, boats, saechki, shangi), kalachi, cooked casseroles, and blini. Fillings of every flavor were included (herbal, vegetable, fruit, mushrooms, meat, fish, cheese, mixed).|$|E
50|$|The {{draw for}} the {{qualifying}} tournament {{was held on}} 12 January 2016 in Guatemala City. Guatemala and Panama, which qualified for the 2012 FIFA Futsal World Cup, were seeded into Groups A and B respectively. The other four teams were placed <b>in</b> two <b>pots,</b> with El Salvador and Honduras <b>in</b> <b>Pot</b> 1, and Belize and Nicaragua <b>in</b> <b>Pot</b> 2.|$|R
50|$|The group stage draw {{took place}} on 21 May 2014 in Minsk, Belarus, and the teams were {{assigned}} to eleven groups from A to K. The 44 teams were allocated into four pots based on their positions in their national leagues 2014, with the top seeded teams being placed <b>in</b> <b>Pot</b> 1 and the lower ranked teams <b>in</b> <b>Pot</b> 2, Pot 3 and the lowest ranked teams <b>in</b> <b>Pot</b> 4. They were drawn into eleven groups of four, with the restriction that teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other.|$|R
50|$|The {{draw for}} phase 2 {{was held on}} the 27 June 2013, in Vienna, Austria. The three lowest ranked teams of the 2014 {{qualification}} are seeded <b>in</b> <b>Pot</b> 1 while the three group winners of Phase 1 are seeded <b>in</b> <b>Pot</b> 2.|$|R
25|$|A {{green roof}} or living roof is a {{roof of a}} {{building}} that is partially or completely covered with vegetation and a growing medium, planted over a waterproofing membrane. It may also include additional layers such as a root barrier and drainage and irrigation systems. Container gardens on roofs, where plants are maintained <b>in</b> <b>pots,</b> are not {{generally considered to be}} true green roofs, although this is debated. Rooftop ponds are another form of green roofs which are used to treat greywater.|$|E
25|$|When Gandhari's {{pregnancy}} {{continued for}} an unusually {{long period of}} time, she beat her womb in frustration. This caused a hardened mass of grey-coloured flesh to issue from her womb. She implored sadhu, the great sage who had blessed her with one hundred sons, to redeem his words. Vyasa divided the ball of flesh into one hundred and one equal pieces, and put them <b>in</b> <b>pots</b> of ghee, which were sealed and buried into the earth for two years. At {{the end of the}} second year, the first pot was opened, and Duryodhana emerged.|$|E
25|$|Strawberries {{are popular}} and {{rewarding}} plants {{to grow in}} the domestic environment, be it for consumption or exhibition purposes, almost anywhere in the world. The best time to plant is in late summer or spring. Plant in full sun or dappled shade, and in somewhat sandy soil. The addition of manure and a balanced fertilizer aids strong growth. Alternatively they can be planted <b>in</b> <b>pots</b> or special planters using compost. Fibre mats placed under each plant will protect fruits from touching the ground, and will act as a weed barrier.|$|E
50|$|The draw of {{the main}} round was held on November 15 at the Gartenhotel Altmannsdorf in Vienna. A total of eight teams {{advanced}} from the group stage to the main round and were located <b>in</b> two <b>pots,</b> with the group winners being <b>in</b> <b>Pot</b> 1 and the runners-up <b>in</b> <b>Pot</b> 2. Teams from the same groups at the group stage {{were not able to}} be drawn together.|$|R
50|$|As the seeding {{order was}} based on the most recent FIFA Rankings prior to the draw, it {{differed}} from the order in the AFC entrant list, which {{was based on}} the FIFA World Rankings of January 2015. Among the six first round winners, three were seeded higher than <b>pot</b> 5 (India <b>in</b> <b>pot</b> 3, Timor-Leste and Bhutan <b>in</b> <b>pot</b> 4), on the basis of ranking points gained from the first round matches, while the other three (Yemen, Cambodia and Chinese Taipei) were seeded <b>in</b> <b>pot</b> 5.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} on December 3 for the 2015 Rugby World Cup Pool Draw France was drawn <b>in</b> <b>Pot</b> 1 while Argentina was drawn <b>in</b> <b>Pot</b> 2 and {{they ended up}} in Pool D and C respectively, meaning they will not meet before the Quarter Finals.|$|R
25|$|Light House Hill (also {{known as}} Beacon Hill) was {{employed}} as a site for a beacon as early as 1746, when England was in conflict with France in the War of Austrian Succession, and the colonies of both were up for grabs. The beacon - whale oil burned <b>in</b> <b>pots</b> - was not only to welcome sailors, but to warn citizens that the French were coming up the harbor {{and it was time}} to take down the musket from over the fireplace. During the Revolutionary War, the beacon served the same purpose, only Britain was the enemy.|$|E
25|$|In {{the draw}} procedure, one team from each pot was drawn {{into each of}} the four groups. The draw also {{determined}} which place in the group teams <b>in</b> <b>pots</b> 2–4 would take (e.g. A2, A3 or A4) to create the match schedule. With Poland automatically assigned in advance to A1, and Ukraine to D1, Pot 1 only had two teams as Spain and the Netherlands were to be drawn into position one in either group B or C. The balls were drawn by four former players who had each been part of European Championship winning teams: Horst Hrubesch, Marco van Basten, Peter Schmeichel and Zinedine Zidane.|$|E
25|$|Zia farming {{produced}} {{a wide array}} of crops, but {{the most important of these}} were maize, beans, and squash, nicknamed the three sisters. These crops were planted in shared or common ground, which everyone contributed. They were the staple of Zia and Pueblo diets. Corn was the most important of all. While some was eaten fresh, most was stored away <b>in</b> <b>pots</b> and cellars for the winter and droughts. When some of the corn dried, it was turned into flour and bread by the women. They would sit outside at grinding stones, singing religious songs while rubbing stones against the corn, producing flour. They sang, because they considered the corn to be sacred.|$|E
50|$|The draw of {{the main}} round was held on 15 November 2011 at the Gartenhotel Altmannsdorf in Vienna.

25|$|Krazy Kat {{takes place}} in a heavily stylized version of Coconino County, Arizona, with Herriman filling the page with caricatured flora and fauna, and rock {{formation}} landscapes typical of the Painted Desert. These backgrounds tend to change dramatically between panels, even while the characters remain stationary. While the local geography is fluid, certain sites were stable—and featured so often in the strip as to become iconic. These latter included Officer Pupp's jailhouse and Kolin Kelly's brickyard. A Southwestern visual style is evident throughout, with clay-shingled rooftops, trees planted <b>in</b> <b>pots</b> with designs imitating Navajo art, along with references to Mexican-American culture. The strip also occasionally features incongruous trappings borrowed from the stage, with curtains, backdrops, theatrical placards, and sometimes even floor lights framing the panel borders.|$|E
25|$|Boron {{has found}} many {{industrial}} applications in recent decades, and new ones {{are still being}} found. A common application is in fiberglass. There has been rapid expansion {{in the market for}} borosilicate glass; most notable among its special qualities is a much greater resistance to thermal expansion than regular glass. Another commercially expanding use of boron and its derivatives is in ceramics. Several boron compounds, especially the oxides, have unique and valuable properties that have led to their substitution for other materials that are less useful. Boron may be found <b>in</b> <b>pots,</b> vases, plates, and ceramic pan-handles for its insulating properties. The compound borax is used in bleaches, for both clothes and teeth. The hardness of boron and some of its compounds give it a wide array of additional uses. A small part (5%) of the boron produced finds use in agriculture.|$|E
25|$|By July 2009, {{work was}} being done on carving the headstones. A supply of the {{traditional}} Portland Stone (Broadcroft Whitbed) was reserved, and blank headstones shaped and shipped to France. Carving of the headstones was done using the Commission's computer-controlled Incisograph system. Also that month, planning and cultivation had started for the plants {{to be used in}} the new cemetery. Many months would be needed to develop and prune the plants <b>in</b> <b>pots</b> so they would be ready to transplant in the Spring of 2010, in preparation for the opening ceremony that July. The limited time between the planned reburials in February 2010, and the opening of the cemetery, meant that the grassed areas would need to be turfed, instead of growing the grass from seeds. The roses used are the 'Remembrance' cultivar, one often used in Commission cemeteries.|$|E
50|$|Clubs <b>in</b> <b>Pot</b> 1 {{were drawn}} to be the seed of each group {{according}} {{to the order of}} their drawing.
