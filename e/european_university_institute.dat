40|$|Earlier this month, the UNHCR {{announced}} Syria’s refugee {{population had}} reached a staggering three million, now the largest refugee population in the world. The bulk of refugees are resettled or in camps in neighbouring countries, mainly Lebanon and Jordan. Syrians taking the incredibly treacherous journey to Europe by foot or by boat, face complex and varying immigration policies. As the refugee crisis worsens, many fear that Europe’s slow and uneven reaction will exacerbate the strain on states in the Middle East.

40|$|Citizenship is {{the legal}} status through which states {{establish}} who their members are. Thanks to this mechanism, a sharp division is established between non-members – foreigners – and members – citizens. As Rogers Brubaker (1992 : 46) points out, the two categories are “correlative, mutually exclusive, exhaustive. ” With the status of citizen, a person not only is permanently linked to a particular state but also acquires a set of rights and duties. In the course of history, each state has developed its own particular conception of citizenship and it {{has worked as a}} fundamental tool to maintain “the intergenerational continuity of the state” (Vink and Bauböck 2013). In particular, this tool has helped to regulate the transmission of membership to new generations and the admittance of new members when international migration takes place.

40|$|The Malaysian {{citizenship}} {{regime is}} shaped by British colonialism, federalism, the politics of communalism and ethnic nationalism. Ius soli has been controversial in Malayan citizenship history due to the immigration history of British Malaya. Birthright citizenship for many generations of immigrants was contested {{because they were not}} readily assimilated into the Malayan way of life, which challenged the ethnic homogeneity of Malay nation-states. The adoption of territorial birthright principles was contested in the post-war period due to the emergence of politics of communalism and ethnic nationalism. As ius soli has been controversial in Malayan citizenship history, the Federation of Malaya (1948) resorted to the principle of double ius soli, followed by the principle of delayed ius soli in 1952 before fully institutionalising unconditional ius soli on the eve of Malayan independence in 1957.

40|$|This report canvasses the {{citizenship}} {{law of the}} Republic of Korea {{with reference}} to its historical background and evolution, the system of citizenship law and administration, the modes of acquisition of citizenship, the grounds {{for the loss of}} citizenship, the law’s attitude to multiple citizenship and statelessness, and issues for future reform. The citizenship regime of the Republic of Korea has been shaped by the country’s background as a historic protonational state with a putatively ‘homogenous’ population (Hobsbawm 1992 : 66), the experience of Japanese rule, waves of outmigration and diasporic experiences, national division, and a ‘migration transition’ since the 1990 s (Castles, Haas & Miller 2014 : 46 - 51). The report focuses on the legal aspects of the citizenship regime and does not purport to discuss the political and social implications of the law, but discerning readers will be able to sense how the backgrounds and processes of nation-building and population movement have shaped the legal regime.
