25|$|Laparoscopic cyst {{decortication}} (also {{referred to}} as marsupialization) consists in the removal {{of one or more}} kidney cysts through laparoscopic surgery, during which cysts are punctured, and the outer wall of the larger cysts is excised with care not to incise the renal parenchyma. This procedure can be useful for pain relief in patients with ADPKD, and is usually indicated after earlier cyst aspiration has confirmed that the cyst to be <b>decorticated</b> is responsible for pain.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Decorticate</b> posturing is {{also called}} <b>decorticate</b> response, <b>decorticate</b> rigidity, flexor posturing, or, colloquially, mummy baby. [...] Patients with <b>decorticate</b> posturing present with the arms flexed, or bent inward on the chest, the hands are clenched into fists, and the legs {{extended}} and feet turned inward. A person displaying <b>decorticate</b> posturing {{in response to}} pain gets a score of three in the motor section of the Glasgow Coma Scale, due to the flexion of muscles due to the neuro-muscular response to the trauma.|$|R
40|$|<b>Decorticate</b> {{rigidity}} {{is a type}} {{of abnormal}} posturing that can make it difficult to move a patient and to change the patient’s position to prevent a decubitus ulcer. This condition poses a latent risk of bed sores. To prevent those complications, we used electroacupuncutre for <b>decorticate</b> rigidity of the upper limbs in a patient with anoxic brain damage. A 51 -year-old man complained of rigidity of both of the upper and lower extremities due to anoxic brain damage. His rigidity was exhibited as flexed arms and extended legs, which are the typical positions in <b>decorticate</b> rigidity. Prior to electroacupuncture, his <b>decorticate</b> rigidity was treated with dantrolene sodium and baclofen. However, his rigidity had not improved. This patient received total 41 sessions of electroacupuncture. The patient’s Modified Ashworth’s Scale changed from 4 at baseline to 2 after the treatment, indicating an improvement in the rigidity of the upper limbs. Preston’s Hypertonicity Scale and passive ROM of the elbow joints also improved. We report the observed effects of electroacupuncture for <b>decorticate</b> rigidity of the upper limbs in a patient with anoxic brain damage. Further controlled studies are needed to determine whether electroacupuncture is a useful alternative treatment for <b>decorticate</b> rigidity in patients with anoxic brain damage...|$|R

2500|$|Plants are {{extremely}} common in heraldry and figure among the earliest charges. The turnip, for instance, makes an early appearance, as does wheat. Trees also appear in heraldry; {{the most frequent}} tree by far is the oak (drawn with large leaves and acorns), followed by the pine. Apples and bunches of grapes occur very frequently, other fruits less so. When the fruit is mentioned, as to indicate a different tincture, the tree {{is said to be}} fructed of the tincture. If a tree is [...] "eradicated" [...] it is shown as if it has been ripped up from the ground, the roots being exposed. [...] "Erased" [...] is rarely used for a similar treatment.

60|$|This irrational muddle of a {{community}} {{in which we live}} gave him that, paid him at that rate for sitting in a room and scheming and telling it lies. For he created nothing, he invented nothing, he economised nothing. I cannot claim that a single one of the great businesses we organised added any real value to human life at all. Several like Tono-Bungay were unmitigated frauds by any honest standard, the giving of nothing coated in advertisements for money. And the things the Hardingham gave out, I repeat, were nothing to the things that came in. I think of the long procession of people who sat down before us and propounded this and that. Now it was a device for selling bread under a fancy name and so escaping the laws as to weight--this was afterwards floated as the <b>Decorticated</b> Health-Bread Company and bumped against the law--now it was a new scheme for still more strident advertisement, now it was a story of unsuspected deposits of minerals, now a cheap and nasty substitute for this or that common necessity, now the treachery of a too well-informed employee, anxious to become our partner. It was all put to us tentatively, persuasively. Sometimes one had a large pink blusterous person trying to carry us off our feet by his pseudo-boyish frankness, now some dyspeptically yellow whisperer, now some earnest, specially dressed youth with an eye-glass and a buttonhole, now some homely-speaking, shrewd Manchester man or some Scotchman eager to be very clear and full.|$|E

50|$|Assessment of {{posture and}} body habitus {{is the next}} step. It {{involves}} general observation about the patient's positioning. There are often two stereotypical postures seen in comatose patients. <b>Decorticate</b> posturing is a stereotypical posturing in which the patient has arms flexed at the elbow, and arms adducted toward the body, with both legs extended. Decerebrate posturing is a stereotypical posturing in which the legs are similarly extended (stretched), but the arms are also stretched (extended at the elbow). The posturing is critical since it indicates where the damage is in the central nervous system. A <b>decorticate</b> posturing indicates a lesion (a point of damage) {{at or above the}} red nucleus, whereas a decerebrate posturing indicates a lesion at or below the red nucleus. In other words, a <b>decorticate</b> lesion is closer to the cortex, as opposed to a decerebrate cortex that is closer to the brainstem.|$|R

5000|$|In {{children}} younger than age two, posturing is not a reliable finding because their nervous systems are not yet developed. [...] However, Reye's syndrome and traumatic brain injury can both cause <b>decorticate</b> posturing in children.|$|R
5000|$|Decerebrate posturing {{indicates}} {{brain stem}} damage, specifically damage {{below the level}} of the red nucleus (e.g. mid-collicular lesion). It is exhibited by people with lesions or compression in the midbrain and lesions in the cerebellum. Decerebrate posturing is commonly seen in pontine strokes. A patient with <b>decorticate</b> posturing may begin to show decerebrate posturing, or may go from one form of posturing to the other. [...] Progression from <b>decorticate</b> posturing to decerebrate posturing is often indicative of uncal (transtentorial) or tonsilar brain herniation. Activation of gamma motor neurons is thought to be important in decerebrate rigidity due to studies in animals showing that dorsal root transection eliminates decerebrate rigidity symptoms.|$|R
