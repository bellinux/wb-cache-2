The mitochondrial (mt) genomes of one species of prostriate tick and two species of metastriate ticks had been sequenced prior to our study. The prostriate tick has the ancestral arrangement of mt genes of arthropods, whereas the two metastriate ticks have rearrangements of eight genes and <b>duplicate</b> <b>control</b> regions. However, the arrangement of genes in the mt genomes of soft ticks had not been studied. We sequenced the mt genomes of two species of soft ticks, Carios capensis and Ornithodoros moubata, and a metastriate tick, Haemaphysalis flava.

40|$|Abstract. Complete {{mitochondrial}} DNA (mtDNA) sequences {{were determined}} for representative species from six snake families: the acrochordid little file snake, the bold boa constrictor, the cylindrophiid red pipe snake, the viperid himehabu, the pythonid ball python, and the xenopeltid sunbeam snake.

Duplication of the control region and translo-cation of the tRNALeu gene were two notable features of the snake mtDNAs. The <b>duplicate</b> <b>control</b> regions had nearly identical nucleotide sequences within species but they were divergent among species, sug-gesting concerted sequence evolution of the two control regions.

Phylogenetic analysis of amino acid sequences of protein genes suggested an unusually high rate of molecular evolution in the snake compared to other vertebrates. Southern hybridization experiments using mtDNAs purified from multiple akamata individuals showed that the duplicate state of the control region is not a transient or unstable feature found in a particular individual, but that it stably occurs in mitochondrial genomes of the species. This may, therefore, be regarded as an unprecedented example of stable functional redundancy in animal mtDNA. However, some of the examined individuals contain a rather scanty proportion of heteroplasmic mtDNAs with an organization of genes distinct from that of the major mtDNA. The gene organization of the minor mtDNA is in agreement with one of models that we present to account for the concerted evolution of <b>duplicate</b> <b>control</b> regions...|$|E

40|$|To help {{understand}} {{the mechanisms of}} gene rearrangement in the mitochondrial (mt) genomes of hemipteroid insects, we sequenced the mt genome of the plague thrips, Thrips imaginis (Thysanoptera). This genome is circular, 15, 407 bp long, and has many unusual features, including (1) rRNA genes inverted and distant from one another, (2) an extra gene for tRNA-Ser, (3) a tRNA-Val lacking a D-arm, (4) two pseudo-tRNA genes, (5) <b>duplicate</b> <b>control</b> regions, and (6) translocations and/or inversions of 24 of the 37 genes. The mechanism of rRNA gene transcription in T. imaginis may be {{different from that of}} other arthropods since the two rRNA genes have inverted and are distant from one another. Further, the rRNA genes are not adjacent or even close to either of the two control regions. Tandem duplication and deletion is a plausible model for the evolution of <b>duplicate</b> <b>control</b> regions and for the gene translocations, but intramitochondrial recombination may account for the gene inversions in T. imaginis. All the 18 genes between control regions # 1 and # 2 have translocated and/or inverted, whereas only six of the 20 genes outside this region have translocated and/or inverted. Moreover, the extra tRNA gene and the two pseudo-tRNA genes are either in this region or immediately adjacent to one of the control regions. These observations suggest that tandem duplication and deletion may be facilitated by the <b>duplicate</b> <b>control</b> regions and may have occurred a number of times in the lineage leading to T. imaginis. T. imaginis shares two novel gene boundaries with a lepidopsocid species from another order of hemipteroid insects, the Psocoptera. The evidence available suggests that these shared gene boundaries evolved by convergence and thus are not informative for the interordinal phylogeny of hemipteroid insects.

40|$|We {{improve the}} taxon {{sampling}} for avian phylogeny by analyzing seven new mitochondrial genomes (a toucan, woodpecker, osprey, forest falcon, American kestrel, heron and a pelican). This improves inference of the avian tree, and it supports three major conclusions. The {{first is that}} some birds (including a parrot, a toucan and the osprey) exhibit a complete duplication of the control region meaning that {{there are at least}} four distinct gene orders within birds. However it appears that there are regions of continued gene conversion between the <b>duplicate</b> <b>control</b> regions, resulting in duplications that can be stable for long evolutionary periods. Because of this stable duplicated state, gene order can eventually either revert to the original order, or change to the new gene order. The existence of this stable duplicate state explains how an apparently unlikely event (finding the same novel gene order) can arise multiple times. Although rare genomic changes have theoretical advantages for tree-reconstruction, they can be compromised if these apparently rare events have a stable intermediate state.

Although snake mitochondrial genomes are also known to possess dupli-cate control regions with nearly identical sequences, the location of the second control region suggested independent occurrence of the duplication on lineages leading to snakes and the Komodo dragon. An-other feature of the mitochondrial genome of the Komodo dragon was the considerable number of tandem repeats, including sequences with a strong secondary structure, as a possible site for the slipped-strand mispairing in replication. These observations are consistent with hypotheses that tandem duplications via the slipped-strand mispairing may induce mitochondrial gene rearrangements and may serve to maintain similar copies of the control region.

40|$|Abstract Background Many {{population}} {{genetic and}} phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) assume that mitochondrial genomes do not undergo recombination. Recently, concerted evolution of duplicated mitochondrial control regions {{has been documented}} {{in a range of}} taxa. Although the molecular mechanism that facilitates concerted evolution is unknown, all proposed mechanisms involve mtDNA recombination. Results Here, we document a duplication of a large region (cytochrome b, tRNA Thr, tRNA Pro, ND 6, tRNA Glu and the control region) in the mitochondrial genome of three related seabird species. To investigate the evolution of <b>duplicate</b> <b>control</b> regions, we sequenced both control region copies (CR 1 and CR 2) from 21 brown (Sula leucogaster), 21 red-footed (S. sula) and 21 blue-footed boobies (S. nebouxii). Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the duplicated control regions are predominantly evolving in concert; however, approximately 51 base pairs at the 5 ' end of CR 1 and CR 2 exhibited a discordant phylogenetic signal and appeared to be evolving independently. Conclusions Both the structure of the duplicated region and the conflicting phylogenetic signals are remarkably similar to a pattern found in Thalassarche albatrosses, which are united with boobies in a large clade that includes all procellariiform and most pelecaniform seabirds. Therefore we suggest that concerted evolution of duplicated control regions either is taxonomically widespread within seabirds, or that it has evolved many times. </p...|$|E
40|$|U NTIL {{recently}} {{enthusiasm for}} conversion of atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm {{in patients with}} rheumatic heart disease has been dampened by {{the high rate of}} reversion to atrial fibrillation soon after conversion. Mitral commissurotomy, if followed by a re-duction of left atrial pressure and size, offers the theoretical possibility of a reduction in this reversion rate. Successful commissurot-omy of itself, however, does not restore sinus rhythm, and many patients previously in sinus rhythm will fibrillate following surgery. Conversion with quinidine is not a benign procedure and sudden death during conver-sion attempts has been reported. 1 - Thus the increasing number of patients presenting as candidates for conversion has increased the need for {{a better understanding of the}} altera-tions in cardiac performance that occur as a result of atrial fibrillation and the changes to be expected upon conversion.

40|$|BACKGROUND:The {{mitochondrial}} genomes {{of snakes}} {{are characterized by}} an overall evolutionary rate {{that appears to be}} one of the most accelerated among vertebrates. They also possess other unusual features, including short tRNAs and other genes, and a <b>duplicated</b> <b>control</b> region that has been stably maintained since it originated more than 70 million years ago. Here, we provide a detailed analysis of evolutionary dynamics in snake mitochondrial genomes to better understand the basis of these extreme characteristics, and to explore the relationship between mitochondrial genome molecular evolution, genome architecture, and molecular function. We sequenced complete mitochondrial genomes from Slowinski's corn snake (Pantherophis slowinskii) and two cottonmouths (Agkistrodon piscivorus) to complement previously existing mitochondrial genomes, and to provide an improved comparative view of how genome architecture affects molecular evolution at contrasting levels of divergence. RESULTS:We present a Bayesian genetic approach that suggests that the <b>duplicated</b> <b>control</b> region can function as an additional origin of heavy strand replication. The two control regions also appear to have different intra-specific versus inter-specific evolutionary dynamics that may be associated with complex modes of concerted evolution. We find that different genomic regions have experienced substantial accelerated evolution along early branches in snakes, with different genes having experienced dramatic accelerations along specific branches. Some of these accelerations appear to coincide with, or subsequent to, the shortening of various mitochondrial genes and the duplication of the control region and flanking tRNAs. CONCLUSION:Fluctuations in the strength and pattern of selection during snake evolution have had widely varying gene-specific effects on substitution rates, and these rate accelerations may have been functionally related to unusual changes in genomic architecture. The among-lineage and among-gene variation in rate dynamics observed in snakes is the most extreme thus far observed in animal genomes, and provides an important study system for further evaluating the biochemical and physiological basis of evolutionary pressures in vertebrate mitochondria...|$|R
40|$|Mitogenomes of {{flatfishes}} (Pleuronectiformes) {{exhibit the}} greatest diversity of gene rearrangements in teleostean fishes. <b>Duplicate</b> <b>control</b> regions (CRs) {{have been found}} in the mito-genomes of two flatfishes, Samariscus latus (Samaridae) and Laeops lanceolata (Bothidae), which is rare in teleosts. It has been reported that duplicate CRs have evolved in a concerted fashion in fishes and other animals, however, whether concerted evo-lution exists in flatfishes remains unknown. In this study, based on five newly sequenced and six previously reported mitogenomes of lefteye flounders in the Bothidae, we explored whether duplicate CRs and concerted evolution exist in these species. Results based on the present study and previous reports show that four out of eleven bothid species examined have duplicate CRs of their mitogenomes. The core regions of the duplicate CRs of mitogenomes in the same species have identical, or nearly identical, sequences when compared to each other. This pattern fits the typical characteristics of concerted evolution. Additionally, phylogenetic and ancestral state reconstruction analysis also provided evidence to support the hypothesis that duplicate CRs evolved concertedly. The core region of concerted evolution is situated at the conserved domains of the CR of the mitogenome from the termination associated sequences (TASs) to the conserved sequence blocks (CSBs). Commonly, this region is con-sidered to regulate mitochondrial replication and transcription. Thus, we hypothesize that the cause of concerted evolution of the duplicate CRs in the mtDNAs of these four bothids may be related to some function of the conserved sequences of the CRs during mitochondrial rep-lication and transcription. We hope our results will provide fresh insight into the molecular mechanisms related to replication and evolution of mitogenomes...|$|E
40|$|RATIONALE: Stable isotope values (?(13) C and ?(15) N) of darted {{skin and}} blubber biopsies can {{shed light on}} habitat use and diet of cetaceans, which are {{otherwise}} difficult to study. Non-dietary factors affect isotopic variability, chiefly the depletion of (13) C due {{to the presence of}} (12) C-rich lipids. The efficacy of post hoc lipid-correction models (normalization) must be tested. METHODS: For tissues with high natural lipid content (e. g., whale skin and blubber), chemical lipid extraction or normalization is necessary. C:N ratios, ?(13) C values and ?(15) N values were determined for <b>duplicate</b> <b>control</b> and lipid-extracted skin and blubber of fin (Balaenoptera physalus), humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae) and minke whales (B. acutorostrata) by continuous-flow elemental analysis isotope ratio mass spectrometry (CF-EA-IRMS). Six different normalization models were tested to correct ?(13) C values for the presence of lipids. RESULTS: Following lipid extraction, significant increases in ?(13) C values were observed for both tissues in the three species. Significant increases were also found for ?(15) N values in minke whale skin and fin whale blubber. In fin whale skin, the ?(15) N values decreased, with no change observed in humpback whale skin. Non-linear models generally out-performed linear models and the suitability of models varied by species and tissue, indicating the need for high model specificity, even among these closely related taxa. CONCLUSIONS: Given the poor predictive power of the models to estimate lipid-free ?(13) C values, and the unpredictable changes in ?(15) N values due to lipid-extraction, we recommend against arithmetical normalization in accounting for lipid effects on ?(13) C values for balaenopterid skin or blubber samples. Rather, we recommend that duplicate analysis of lipid-extracted (?(13) C values) and non-treated tissues (?(15) N values) be used...|$|E

In Testudines, duplicate mtCRs {{have been reported in}} the mtDNA of the Asian big-headed turtle, Platysternon megacephalum, which has three living subspecies. However, the evolutionary pattern of these CRs remains unclear. In this study, we report the completed sequences of duplicate CRs from 20 individuals belonging to three subspecies of this turtle and discuss the micro-evolutionary analysis of the evolution of duplicate CRs. Genetic distances calculated with MEGA 4. 1 using the complete duplicate CR sequences revealed that within turtle subspecies, genetic distances between orthologous copies from different individuals were 0. 63 % for CR 1 and 1. 2 % for CR 2 app:addword:respectively, and the average distance between paralogous copies of CR 1 and CR 2 was 4. 8 %. Phylogenetic relationships were reconstructed from the CR sequences, excluding the variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs) at the 3 ' end using three methods: neighbor-joining, maximum likelihood algorithm, and Bayesian inference. These data show that any two CRs within individuals were more genetically distant from orthologous genes in different individuals within the same subspecies. This suggests independent evolution of the two mtCRs within each P. megacephalum subspecies. Reconstruction of separate phylogenetic trees using different CR components (TAS, CD, CSB, and VNTRs) suggested the role of recombination in the evolution of duplicate CRs. Consequently, recombination events were detected using RDP software with break points at ≈ 290 bp and ≈ 1, 080 bp. Based on these results, we hypothesize that duplicate CRs in P. megacephalum originated from heterological ancestral recombination of mtDNA. Subsequent recombination could have resulted in homogenization during independent evolutionary events, thus maintaining the functions of duplicate CRs in the mtDNA of P. megacephalum...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{big-headed turtle}} (Platysternon megacephalum) from east Asia {{is the sole}} living {{representative}} of a poorly-studied turtle lineage (Platysternidae). It has no close living relatives, and its phylogenetic position within turtles {{is one of the}} outstanding controversies in turtle systematics. Platysternon was traditionally considered to be close to snapping turtles (Chelydridae) based on some studies of its morphology and mitochondrial (mt) DNA, however, other studies of morphology and nuclear (nu) DNA do not support that hypothesis. Results We sequenced the complete mt genome of Platysternon and the nearly complete mt genomes of two other relevant turtles and compared them to turtle mt genomes from the literature to form the largest molecular dataset used to date to address this issue. The resulting phylogeny robustly rejects the placement of Platysternon with Chelydridae, but instead shows that it {{is a member of the}} Testudinoidea, a diverse, nearly globally-distributed group that includes pond turtles and tortoises. We also discovered that Platysternon mtDNA has large-scale gene rearrangements and possesses two, nearly identical, control regions, features that distinguish it from all other studied turtles. Conclusion Our study robustly determines the phylogenetic placement of Platysternon and provides a well-resolved outline of major turtle lineages, while demonstrating the significantly greater resolving power of comparing large amounts of mt sequence over that of short fragments. Earlier phylogenies placing Platysternon with chelydrids required a temporal gap in the fossil record that is now unnecessary. The <b>duplicated</b> <b>control</b> regions and gene rearrangements of the Platysternon mtDNA probably resulted from the duplication of part of the genome and then the subsequent loss of redundant genes.

We sequenced complete mitochondrial genomes from Slowinski's corn snake (Pantherophis slowinskii) and two cottonmouths (Agkistrodon piscivorus) to complement previously existing mitochondrial genomes, and to provide an improved comparative view of how genome architecture affects molecular evolution at contrasting levels of divergence. Results We present a Bayesian genetic approach that suggests that the <b>duplicated</b> <b>control</b> region can function as an additional origin of heavy strand replication. The two control regions also appear to have different intra-specific versus inter-specific evolutionary dynamics that may be associated with complex modes of concerted evolution. We find that different genomic regions have experienced substantial accelerated evolution along early branches in snakes, with different genes having experienced dramatic accelerations along specific branches. Some of these accelerations appear to coincide with, or subsequent to, the shortening of various mitochondrial genes and the duplication of the control region and flanking tRNAs. Conclusion Fluctuations in the strength and pattern of selection during snake evolution have had widely varying gene-specific effects on substitution rates, and these rate accelerations may have been functionally related to unusual changes in genomic architecture. The among-lineage and among-gene variation in rate dynamics observed in snakes is the most extreme thus far observed in animal genomes, and provides an important study system for further evaluating the biochemical and physiological basis of evolutionary pressures in vertebrate mitochondria. </p...|$|R
