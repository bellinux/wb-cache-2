2500|$|Cultural {{diplomacy}} {{presents a}} number of unique challenges to any government attempting to carry out cultural diplomacy programs.

[...] The most the government can <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> work to create opening so the message can get through to mass audiences abroad.

50|$|Gadamer {{pointed out}} that {{prejudice}} {{is an element of}} our understanding and is not per se without value.

He said that we can never step outside of our tradition — all we can <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> understand it. This further elaborates the idea of the hermeneutic circle.|$|E

5000|$|In 2015 Kellner was re-nominated by his {{political}} club {{to run for}} re-election as District Leader, an unpaid position he had held since 2012.

5000|$|Unfortunately, what Wells {{tries to}} do in this chapter is to take this invalid, discredited theory and tar modern (and even not so modern) {{evolutionary}} biology with it. The biogenetic law is not Darwinism or neo-Darwinism, however. It is not part of any modern evolutionary theory. Wells is carrying out a bait-and-switch here, marshalling the evidence and citations that properly demolish the Haeckelian dogma, and then claiming that this is part of [...] "our best evidence for Darwin's theory." ...While Jonathan Wells would like to discredit evolution, and in Haeckel's embryos, he has found a story to his liking. There is a bit of intentional fakery to it, there is a clear affiliation with Darwin himself, and there is a long history of recognition of Haeckel's influence intermingled with unambiguous repudiation of his ideas. ...All he has to <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> entangle Haeckel's discredited theories and poor modern reputation with the set of valid observations and modern explanations, and he can bury the truth under innuendo and association. in original ...|$|E

5000|$|In metaphilosophy, Hall {{held that}} there could be no {{empirical}} or deductive proofs of the superiority of one basic philosophy over another (say, of realism over phenomenalism), because he took preference of one or the other to be a function of acceptance of the view's basic categories, an attitude he called [...] "categorial commitment". We are all, he claimed, trapped within a [...] "categorio-centric predicament", since we cannot step outside of all categorial frameworks and determine which is best from some preferable outside footing. All we can <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> determine which is most consonant with both common sense and modern science (which he denied were in irresolvable conflict). Cognizers do this, in his view, by examining what Hall called [...] "the grammar of common sense", which he contrasted with individual common-sense beliefs such as those included in George Edward Moore's famous list. It was his view that any philosophical position that conflicts too deeply or frequently with those features of common sense that are reflected in the basic grammatical forms that natural languages can take will be implausible both to common people and to philosophers when they are not actively engaging in revisionary metaphysics.|$|E

We discuss robots that can reach with their hand specific unseen parts of their body, the role of tactile input and sensory multimodality in knowledge of one’s own body, and how this knowledge can be demonstrated by robots that show “surprise ” when their predictions are falsified.
