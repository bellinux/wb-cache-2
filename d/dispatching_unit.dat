30|$|Transportation to {{and from}} {{treatment}} usually means getting patients from home to hospital, between different hospitals or from hospitals to home, i.e. few passengers per trip and wide area coverage. Within the Norwegian legal framework, this transport can be undertaken {{in one of three}} ways: First, by taxi, i.e. a vehicle with a legal taximeter, fewer than 17 seats and registered as a taxi; second, by a private bus company, i.e. whose vehicles have nine or more passenger seats registered under an occasional passenger transport licence; and, third, by the health corporationâ€™s own vehicles, i.e. buses on licence but operated by health corporation staff. In the case of all three alternatives, the responsible <b>dispatching</b> <b>unit</b> is located within the health corporation. Transfer of the dispatching service from private taxi companies to the health corporation is common to all alternatives.|$|E

Given an input and an output language describing the sequences of events that occur at the input and the output, respectively, of an I/O DES, we study whether {{it is possible to}} realize the system as a unit consisting of a given set of buffers of finite capacity, called a <b>dispatching</b> <b>unit.</b> The notions of stable, conditionally stable, dispatchable and conditionally dispatchable units are introduced as existence of stable (or input-output bounded), and causal (or prefix preserving) input- output maps, and effectively computable necessary and sufficient conditions for testing them are obtained...|$|E

40|$|Designing {{a modern}} {{microprocessor}} {{is a complex}} task that demands careful balance between cycle time, cycleper -instruction and area costs.

It must provide adequate bandwidth to sustain peak instruction issue rate and must predict future instruction sequences with high accuracy. In the UltraSPARC prefetch and <b>dispatch</b> <b>unit</b> design, we examined a technique that combined two prediction methods: predictive set-associative cache and in-cache prediction. This combination was compared with alternative designs such as direct-mapped and setassociative caches, and a branch history table and a branch target buffer. We chose the combined prediction technique for its fast cycle time, lower cycle-perinstruction, and lower area costs.

However the managing different energy sources have some practical issues like optimal power delivery and battery management.

An online monitoring and load demand information can provide the user with reliable and constant electric power. Practically, consumer load demand always varies frequently and unpredictably.
