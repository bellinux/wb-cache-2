40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} manufacturing exports and <b>imports</b> <b>of</b> capital goods in Thailand using monthly data from January 2000 to July 2011. The results from bounds testing for cointegration show that there exists long-run equilibrium relationship between exports and <b>imports</b> <b>of</b> capital goods in manufacturing sector. In addition, the positive relationship between the growth rate <b>of</b> <b>imports</b> <b>of</b> capital goods and {{the growth rate of}} manufacturing exports is observed. The results support the notion that foreign capital is essential in the process of industrialization, and thus economic growth. A decline in <b>imports</b> <b>of</b> capital goods will reduce manufacturing exports and impedes economic growth in the future. It is also likely that exports of manufactured products are the main source of foreign exchanges to finance <b>imports</b> <b>of</b> capital goods which cannot be produced in the country due to comparative disadvantage. ...|$|R

40|$|Similar {{products}} are imported at different prices, suggesting that varieties are vertically differentiated between {{low and high}} quality. This differentiation of varieties according to their quality enables to provide new evidence regarding the collapse of world trade during the recent crisis. The decrease of world demand has affected the <b>imports</b> <b>of</b> high quality varieties to a larger extent, leading to a decrease <b>of</b> <b>import</b> prices. Our econometric estimations {{over a period of}} ten years confirm that the revenue elasticity <b>of</b> <b>import</b> quantity is larger for high quality imports. Hence, a decrease of world revenue is expected to decrease more the world <b>imports</b> <b>of</b> high quality as compared with the <b>imports</b> <b>of</b> low quality.

5|$|The {{economic}} {{revolution in}} England and the tariff {{policies of the}} British also caused massive de-industrialization in other sectors throughout India and Mysore. For example, the gunny bag weaving business had been a monopoly of the Goniga people, which they lost when the British began ruling the area. The <b>import</b> <b>of</b> a chemical substitute for saltpetre (potassium nitrate) affected the Uppar community, the traditional makers of saltpetre for use in gunpowder. The <b>import</b> <b>of</b> kerosene affected the Ganiga community which supplied oils. Foreign enamel and crockery industries affected the native pottery business, and mill-made blankets replaced the country-made blankets called kambli. This economic fallout {{led to the formation}} of community-based social welfare organisations to help those within the community to cope better with their new economic situation, including youth hostels for students seeking education and shelter. However, the British economic policies created a class structure consisting of a newly established middle class comprising various blue and white-collared occupational groups, including agents, brokers, lawyers, teachers, civil servants and physicians. Due to a more flexible caste hierarchy, the middle class contained a heterogeneous mix of people from different castes.|$|E

5|$|Until its repeal, most {{extensions}} to {{copyright law}} were based around provisions {{found in the}} Statute of Anne. The one successful bill from the lobbying in the 1730s, which came into force on 29 September 1739, extended the provision prohibiting the <b>import</b> <b>of</b> foreign books to also prohibit the <b>import</b> <b>of</b> books that, while originally published in Britain, were being reprinted in foreign nations and then shipped to England and Wales. This was intended to stop the influx of cheap books from Ireland, and also repealed the price restrictions in the Statute of Anne. Another alteration was over the legal deposit provisions of the Statute, which many booksellers found unfair. Despite an initial period of compliance, the principle of donating copies of books to certain libraries lapsed, {{partly due to the}} unwieldiness of the statute's provisions and partly {{because of a lack of}} cooperation by the publishers. In 1775 Lord North, who was Chancellor of the University of Oxford, succeeded in passing a bill that reiterated the legal deposit provisions and granted the universities perpetual copyright on their works.|$|E
