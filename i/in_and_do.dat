However the agreements included a Principle of Effectivity under which each colonial power had to set up an effective presence in the territory—by obtaining treaties from local tribal chiefs, flying their flag, and setting up an administration and police force to keep order—to confirm the claim. If they did not, a rival could come <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> so, thereby 'legally' taking over the territory {{in the eyes of the}} civilized powers. In 1890 neither colonial power had treaties or an effective presence in Katanga, and as reports came of gold and copper being found in Katanga, the stage was set for a race between the BSAC and Free State.|$|E

In a 1990 letter to Mark Lewisohn, Klein refuted a claim made by Lewisohn in his book The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions, that the single was intended as a money-making exercise; Klein said it was purely a mark of Lennon's regard for [...] "Something" [...] and [...] "to point out George as a writer, and give him courage to go <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> his own LP. Which he did." [...] Following the Beatles' break-up in April 1970, Harrison's ascendancy as a songwriter would continue with his triple album All Things Must Pass, building on the promise of White Album tracks such as [...] "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" [...] and his two contributions to Abbey Road.|$|E
500|$|Members {{from the}} Rainmen profusely criticized the {{brutality}} of the Express throughout the series as well. Kevin Young was told {{by some of the}} Windsor players that their coach had told them to [...] "take out" [...] him, Liam McMorrow and Fisher. Cliff Clinkscales said, [...] "There's a difference between playing physical and dirty and hurting people." [...] Halifax entered Game 7 with two players out with concussions they suffered in the series itself. Clinkscales also played with injured ribs. Despite this, Levingston attempted to convince the players to play without their coaches, who favored forfeiting it. He also offered the Rainmen new coaches, a raised salary, and $1,000, but to no avail. Haywood said, [...] "How could we play without coach, bringing another coach <b>in?</b> <b>And</b> <b>do</b> what? Coach us? He doesn't even know us." [...] Levingston, on the other hand, slammed Clarós, saying that [...] "instead of leading our team to the championship, he led a group of talented players to broken contracts and a lifetime of controversy." [...] The owner claimed that he felt cheated and that the players were misled by their coaches. He took full responsibility for leading the Rainmen into the WFCU Centre ahead of schedule but believed that the two teams could have negotiated to avoid conflict.|$|E

500|$|Grohl and Jones {{produced}} the record across {{a period of}} one week in October 1994, with Grohl on vocals and all instruments. Both would arrive {{in the morning at}} Robert Lang Studios, start production by noon and do four songs a day. According to Grohl, during the recording process he would run from room to room, [...] "still sweating and shaking from playing drums and [...] pick up the guitar and put down a track, do the bass, maybe another guitar part, have a sip of coffee and then go <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> the next song". The only performance by an outsider was a guitar part on [...] "X-Static" [...] provided by Greg Dulli of The Afghan Whigs, who was watching Grohl record the songs. Grohl eventually asked him if he wanted to play and handed him a guitar. Each song took about 45 minutes to be completed, and the compositions were recorded in the same order that became the album's track listing. The only song that required two run-throughs before completion was [...] "I'll Stick Around". Grohl was insecure about his singing, and added effects to his voice in [...] "Floaty", and tried to enhance the performance through double track – [...] "You know how people double their vocals to make them stronger?

500|$|In this episode, Michael Scott {{describes}} the Dundies as [...] "like the Golden Globes but less mean" [...] referring to Ricky Gervais' hosting of the 2011 Golden Globe Awards; which left critics questioning {{if he had}} gone [...] "too far". As {{executive producer of the}} American series and creator of the original British series, Gervais stated on his blog that the line was inserted as a metajoke was intended as [...] "a little in-joke". Near the beginning of the episode, Deangelo compares Meredith Palmer's (Kate Flannery) house to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Michael notes that [...] "When Larry King died, they didn't just cancel his show", showing that Michael is unaware that Larry King is not deceased. Later, he notes that [...] "they got Piers Morgan to come <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> his show" [...] instead. The final song that the office sings to Michael is a parody of [...] "Seasons of Love" [...] from the Broadway musical Rent. Dwight later reveals in a talking head that he is always the padawan learner, and never a Jedi knight, a reference to the 1977 film Star Wars and its franchise. Michael notes that he wanted his last Dundies celebration to be like the 1990 film The Godfather Part III, rather than the [...] "confusing" [...] 1972 film The Godfather I, which he notes had [...] "three big laughs". Additionally, the episode contains several references to the film The King's Speech, notably during the scene in which Deangelo gives his speech at the Dundies while listening to his Walkman played at a high volume.|$|E
500|$|In January 1966, Wilson {{commenced}} recording {{sessions for}} the Beach Boys' forthcoming album Pet Sounds, which {{was largely a}} collaboration with lyricist Tony Asher. When the other Beach Boys returned from a three-week tour of Japan and Hawaii, they were presented with {{a substantial portion of}} a new album, with music that was in many ways a jarring departure from their earlier style. [...] According to various reports, the group fought over the new direction. Brian remembers that Carl was enthused with the album, but neither their brother Dennis nor Love were, while Asher recalls that Dennis, Love, and Al Jardine [...] "certainly" [...] expressed frustration with the new music and its lyrics. Love said: [...] "When it got to that period of Brian's life that's when he started doing a lot of drugs. We were touring a lot and we'd come back <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> an album like Pet Sounds, for instance, and some of the words were so totally offensive to me that I wouldn't even sing 'em because I thought it was too nauseating." [...] One of his specific points of objection was the original lyrics of [...] "I Know There's an Answer", then known as [...] "Hang On to Your Ego", a reference to the ego deaths associated with psychedelics. Brian also believed that the band was worried about him separating from the group, and that they [...] "resisted" [...] the increasing number of vocal roles he had given to himself. Love wrote that he [...] "would have liked to have had a greater hand in some of the songs and been able to incorporate more often my 'lead voice,' which we'd had so much success with". Dennis denied that the band disagreed with Brian's direction on Pet Sounds, calling the rumors [...] "interesting," [...] that there was [...] "not one person in the group that could come close to Brian's talent," [...] and that he [...] "couldn't imagine who" [...] would have resisted Brian's leadership.|$|E

2500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for the album began at Island Records' newly opened Basing Street Studios, London, {{at the same}} time as Jethro Tull's Aqualung in December 1970. Upon the recommendation of Fleetwood Mac, the band then moved to Headley Grange, a remote Victorian Estate house in East Hampshire, England, to conduct additional recordings. Here they used the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. Jimmy Page later recalled: [...] "We needed the sort of facilities where we could have a cup of tea and wander around the garden and go <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> what we had to do." [...] This relaxed, atmospheric environment at Headley Grange also provided other advantages for the band.

[...] But Tuck started his 2008 campaign in Michael Strahan-like fashion by sacking Washington Redskins quarterback Jason Campbell in the first play of the season opener. The Giants went on to defeat their division rivals the Washington Redskins 16–7. Tuck followed his exceptional performance in week one with an outstanding performance against the St. Louis Rams. Tuck finished the game with 2.0 sacks and an interception return for a touchdown in a Giants victory in week two. The interception and touchdown marked the first of Tuck's professional career. The touchdown was his first since his junior season at Notre Dame.|$|E

For example, Sansa Stark arrives at Winterfell to marry Ramsay Bolton in [...] "High Sparrow," [...] a plotline that had been given to a minor character in the novels. In an interview, show writer David Benioff explains that Sophie Turner's development as an actress {{was one of the reasons}} that they decided to give her character more dramatic scenes, saying, [...] "Even if [...] come <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> a great audition, it’s so hard to know if they’re going to quite literally grow into the parts. With Sansa and Arya in particular, their storylines have become quite dark. It was such a gamble and the fact that they’ve both become such great wonderful actresses is a bit of a miracle."
