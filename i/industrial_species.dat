5000|$|Aerobic {{fermentation}} is also {{essential for}} multiple industries, resulting in human domestication of several yeast strains. Beer and other alcoholic beverages, throughout human history, {{have played a}} significant role in society through drinking rituals, providing nutrition, medicine, and uncontaminated water. [...] During the domestication process, organisms shift from natural environments that are more variable and complex to simple and stable environments with a constant substrate. This often favors specialization adaptations in domesticated microbes, associated with relaxed selection for non-useful genes in alternative metabolic strategies or pathogenicity. [...] Domestication might be partially responsible for the traits that promote aerobic fermentation in <b>industrial</b> <b>species.</b> Introgression and HGT is common in Saccharomyces domesticated strains. [...] Many commercial wine strains have significant portions of their DNA derived from HGT of non-Saccharomyces species. HGT and introgression are less common in nature than is seen during domestication pressures. [...] For example, the important industrial yeast strain Saccharomyces pastorianus, is an interspecies hybrid of S. cerevisiae and the cold tolerant S. eubayanus. [...] This hybrid is commonly used in lager-brewing, which requires slow, low temperature fermentation.|$|E

40|$|Technical {{efficiency}} in the Danish trawl fishery in the North Sea is estimated for 1997 and 1998 by a stochastic production frontier model. This model allows noise when the frontier and the technical efficiency is found, which for fisheries {{is a reasonable}} assumption. The {{results show that the}} production frontier can be modelled by a translog function without time effects and a technical ineffi-ciency function. The type of fishery (industrial or consumption), size of vessel (greater or lesser than 60 GRT) and year give a good explanation for the ineffi-ciency in the fleet. The average technical efficiency is estimated to be 0. 82.

40|$|Many {{bacteria}} display substantial intra-specific genomic {{diversity that}} produces significant phenotypic variation between {{strains of the}} same species. Understanding the genetic basis of these strain-specific phenotypes {{is especially important for}} industrial microorganisms where these characters match individual strains to specific industrial processes. Oenococcus oeni, a bacterium used during winemaking, is one such <b>industrial</b> <b>species</b> where large numbers of strains show significant differences in commercially important industrial phenotypes. To ascertain the basis of these phenotypic differences, the genomic content of ten wine strains of O. oeni were mapped by array-based comparative genome hybridization (aCGH). These strains comprised a genomically diverse group in which large sections of the reference genome were often absent from individual strains. To place the aCGH results in context, whole genome sequence was obtained for one of these strains and compared with two previously sequenced, unrelated strains. While the three strains shared a core group of conserved ORFs, up to 10 % of the coding potential of any one strain was specific to that isolate. The genome of O. oeni is therefore likely to be much larger than that present in any single strain and it is these strain-specific regions that are likely to be responsible for differences in industrial phenotypes.

In this study the floristic list of the region is presented and their life forms and endangered species are stated. Field data collections were conducted during the years 2007 through 2008. First the studied area boundaries were exposed on a topographic map with a scale of 1 : 25000. Then, the plant species of the region were collected and identified according to the floras. According to the presented list, there were 307 species belonging to 209 genuses which are classified in 51 families. The Asteraceae has the highest species diversity in the region with 33 genus and 52 species.

40|$|Aspergillus {{comprises}} a genus of multicellular eukaryotic microorganisms containing {{close to}} 200 different species. Among them, the filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger exhibits great diversity in its phenotype {{and it is}} found, both in marine and terrestrial habitats. A. niger produces many metabolites that are valuable commodities, e. g., organic acids, but is also able to secrete {{a wide range of}} hydrolytic enzymes, while some strains exhibit pathogenicity. Although A. niger is a widely used <b>industrial</b> <b>species</b> used for metabolite production, relatively {{little is known about the}} regulation of its metabolism. We therefore undertook a functional genomics approach to produce transcriptome data of high quality trying to uncover novel regulatory processes and the transcription factors associated to them. Throughout this thesis we worked with several wild type and gene deletion A. niger strains, i. e., the ancestor of an industrial glucoamylase producer strain, A. niger BO 1; the acidogenic wild type strain ATCC 1015 and the industrial enzyme-producing strain CBS 513. 88, both strains already sequenced. High variation within these two later strains was confirmed with the genomics and transcriptomics approaches used in combination with exo-metabolite profiling. Genotypic differences were observed to accumulate in metabolic pathways, e. g., essential to production of organic acids for A. niger ATCC 1015 and of protein synthesis for CBS 513. 88. Overall, the studies reported in this thesis illustrate the complexity of the regulatory circuits regulating cellular processes. For example, through comparative genomics approaches, we exposed the reasons why glycerol metabolism and maltose metabolism are different in closely related species. We demonstrated that the two industrially relevant Aspergillus species, A. niger and A. oryzae do not possess the same maltose uptake, metabolism and regulatory mechanisms. While, the two later studies reported in this thesis were not as focused as the previous ones, but more exploratory in terms of looking for novel regulatory roles played by the transcription factors studied: AdrA, FacB, CreA and AreB; we think that our results could help to improve understanding of the metabolic regulation in A. niger by several transcriptional regulators that will lead to better tuning and improvement of production processes and wider exploitation of A. niger as a cell factory...|$|E

The model implement local fights among small group of individual and a synchronous random walk on a 2 D lattice. The faith of the system, i. e. the spreading or disappearance of the species is determined by their initial density and fight frequency. The initial density of the emergent species has {{to be higher than}} a critical threshold for total spreading but this value depends in a non-trivial way of the fight frequency. Below the threshold any better adapted species disappears showing that a qualitative advantage is not enough for a minority to win. No strategy is involved but spatial organization turns out to be crucial. For instance at minority densities of zero measure some very rare local geometries which occur by chance are found to be killer geometries. Once set they lead with high probability to the total destruction of the preexisting majority species. The occurrence rate of these killer geometries is function of the system size.

40|$|Many factors {{determine}} the susceptibility of wood to marine borer attack. It {{is thought that}} {{one of them is the}} specific gravity. A study on the relationship between wood specific gravity and the intensity of marine borer attack was conducted in the seashore of Rambut Island (in Java Sea) in 1988. Samples were made of woods of <b>industrial</b> plantation forest <b>species</b> with the size of 30 cm long, 5 cm wide and 2, 5 cm high. The samples were randomly arranged like a raft and put inside the sea. They were observed after three months. The results reveal that specific gravity asertain the intensity of marine borer infestation, except Tectona grandis, Tectona grandis 12 the most resistant to marine borer attack although its specific gravity is lower than Eucalyptus urophylla, Altingia excelsa, Acacia mangium and Pometia pinnata...|$|R
