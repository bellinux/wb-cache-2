40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to identify the dynamics of a Tenneco Automotive hydraulic <b>damper</b> <b>valve</b> and to predict valve performance. Accurate simulations of <b>damper</b> <b>valve</b> performance can be used to improve valve designs without the expense of physical testing. The Tenneco <b>damper</b> <b>valve</b> consists of thin shims and a spring preloaded disc that restricts fluid from exiting the main flow orifices. The deflection of the shims and spring are dependent on the flow-rate through the valve. The pressure distribution acting on the deformable valve components is investigated numerically using a dynamic modelling technique. This technique involves sequential geometry and simulation updating, while varying both the geometry and flow-rate. The valve deflection is calculated by post-processing the pressure distribution. Valve performance can be predicted by coupling the valve deflection with CFD pressure results...|$|R

40|$|Flow {{control valves}} used in {{automotive}} suspension dampers are almost universally {{based upon the}} restriction of flow using Belleville washers. These washers {{can best be described}} as a non-flat washer of conical shape and uniform thickness. They are also known as disc springs and are commonly used for load bearing in which their compactness and ability to produce a wide range of load-deflection characteristics provide an alternative to conventional coil springs. Due to the non-linear behaviour of Belleville washers, and the complex flow paths in an automotive <b>damper</b> <b>valve,</b> it is difficult to predict the resulting pressure-flow characteristic. As a result, <b>damper</b> <b>valve</b> design is often considered to be a 'black art' best carried out by an experienced engineer using an experimental-based trial-and-error approach. Clearly, without the aid of an analytical tool to predict the behaviour of prototype systems it is difficult for the designer to fully exploit the functionality of a particular design. The current paper describes theoretical and experimental studies undertaken to investigate the pressure-flow characteristic of a Belleville washer-based <b>damper</b> <b>valve.</b> Existing load-deflection theory was extended to account for the hydraulic pressure acting on the surfaces of the washer. However, poor agreement was obtained between the measured pressure-flow data using a uniform pressure distribution across the washer diameter. For this reason the model was developed further to include the effect of a non-uniform pressure distribution within the valve. Computational fluid dynamics software was used to predict the pressure regime within the valve and this, in turn, was used to calculate the forces acting {{on the surface of the}} Belleville washer. The improved model was found to match the experimental behaviour with good accuracy, both for a range of spring pre-load conditions and for applications where several washers are stacked up in parallel. However further work would be required to develop a reliable simulation tool as an element of trial and error was necessary to estimate some simulation parameters...|$|R
5000|$|In a {{hydropneumatic}} suspension system, each wheel is connected, {{not to a}} spring, but to a hydraulic suspension unit consisting of a hydraulic accumulator sphere of about 12 cm in diameter containing pressurised nitrogen, a cylinder containing hydraulic fluid screwed to the suspension sphere, a piston inside the cylinder connected by levers to the suspension itself, and a <b>damper</b> <b>valve</b> between the piston and the sphere. A membrane in the sphere prevented the nitrogen from escaping. The motion of the wheels translated to a motion of the piston, which acted on the oil in the nitrogen cushion and provided the spring effect. The <b>damper</b> <b>valve</b> took place of the shock absorber in conventional suspensions. The hydraulic cylinder was fed with hydraulic fluid from the main pressure reservoir via a height corrector, a valve controlled by the mid-position of the anti-roll bar connected to the axle. If the suspension was too low, the height corrector introduced high-pressure fluid; if it was too high, it released fluid back to the fluid reservoir. In this manner, a constant ride height was maintained. A control in the cabin allowed the driver to select one of five heights: normal riding height, two slightly higher riding heights for poor terrain, and two extreme positions for changing wheels. (The correct term, oleopneumatic (oil-air), has never gained widespread use. Hydropneumatic (water-air) continues to be preferred overwhelmingly.) ...|$|R

40|$|Reed valve {{dynamics}} has a {{major role}} on the performance and reliability of compressors and {{has been the subject}} of many studies over the years. In terms of mathematical modeling, most of these studies describe valve dynamics through a mass-spring-damper system, in which a damping coefficient has to be empirically adjusted. This is a consequence of little knowledge about the effect of different parameters on <b>valve</b> <b>damping.</b> For instance, in spite of great effort to understand viscous effects on the pressure distribution acting on the valve surface, very few works have addressed such effects on <b>valve</b> <b>damping,</b> especially for <b>valve</b> geometries found in compressors. The present study aims to experimentally quantify <b>valve</b> <b>damping</b> under controlled conditions, considering the effects of clamping geometry, clamping force, gasket thickness and the presence of fluid around the valve. Finally, experimental data of damping coefficients are used to predict valve dynamics and compressor efficiency.

40|$|Vehicle {{suspension}} {{design and}} dynamics analysis {{play a key}} role in enhancement of automotive system performance. Despite extensive developments in actively-controlled suspensions, their commercial applications have been limited due to the associated high cost and weight. Alternative designs in either passive or semi-active suspensions are highly desirable to achieve competitive vehicle performance with relatively lower cost and greater reliability. This dissertation research proposes two hydro-pneumatic suspension strut designs, including a twin-gas-chamber strut, and systematically investigates various concepts in roll- and pitch-coupled suspensions employing hydraulic, pneumatic and hybrid fluidic interconnections between the wheel struts. The proposed strut designs, including single- and twin-gas-chamber struts, offer larger working area and thus lower operating pressure, and integrate <b>damping</b> <b>valves.</b> Nonlinear mathematical models of the strut forces due to various interconnected and unconnected suspension configurations are formulated incorporating fluid compressibility, floating piston dynamics, and variable symmetric and asymmetric <b>damping</b> <b>valves,</b> which clearly show the feedback damping effects of the interconnections between different wheel struts. The properties and dynamic responses of the proposed concepts in roll- and pitch-coupled suspension struts are evaluated in conjunction with in-plane and three-dimensional nonlinear vehicle models. The validity of the vehicle models is demonstrated by comparing their responses with the available measured data. The analyses of the proposed coupled suspensions are performed to derive their bounce-mode, anti-roll, anti-pitch and warp-mode properties, and vehicle dynamic responses to external excitations. These include road roughness, steering and braking, and crosswinds. The results suggest that the fluidically-coupled passive suspension could yield considerable benefits in enhancing vehicle ride and handing performance. Furthermore these offer superior design flexibility. The suspension struts offer a large number of coupling possibilities in the three-dimensions, some of which however would not be feasible, particularly for commercial vehicles where suspension loads may vary considerably. A generalized analytical model for a range of interconnected suspensions is thus developed, and a performance criterion is formulated to assess the feasibility of a particular interconnection in a highly efficient manner. The handling and directional responses of a three-dimensional vehicle model employing X-coupled hydro-pneumatic suspension are evaluated under split-o straight-line braking and braking-in-a-turn maneuvers. The results clearly show that the X-coupled suspension offers enhanced anti-roll and anti-pitch properties while retaining the soft vertical ride and warp properties. Fundamental pitch and vertical dynamics of a road vehicle are also considered to derive a set of essential design rules for suspension design and tuning for realizing desirable pitch performanc...|$|R

The self-adjustable shock absorber VZN, an intelligent shock absorber, realized without electronics or mechanisms, grant with European Patent EP 1190184 B and Romanian Patent 118546, {{is much better than}} standard ones because confers possibilities of stepwise adjustment of damping force as function as the instantaneous piston position.

Where fans and pumps serve a varying process load, a simple way to vary the delivered quantity of fluid is with a <b>damper</b> or <b>valve</b> in the outlet of the fan or pump, which by its increased pressure drop, reduces the flow in the process.

40|$|A semi-empirical {{method is}} {{developed}} {{to describe the}} dynamic behaviour of check valves in pipeline systems. The method is based on parameterized valve models and dimensionless valve characteristics, which may be obtained from experiments. The check valve is considered as a black box with certain input and output characteristics. The check valve closure and associated pressure surges are the dominant phenomena. Undamped check valves may {{be considered as a}} special case of <b>damped</b> check <b>valves.</b> Much attention is paid to the description of the hydrodynamic (fluid) forces on the internal, moving valve elements. These elements may be considered as translating or rotating bodies with (at least) one plane of symmetry. The equations of motion for the constrained, unsteady motion of such a body in an unconfined, unsteady fluid flow are based on the dynamical theory of Kirchhoff, extended to an unsteady fluid flow. The equivalent equations for a body in a confined fluid are based on Lagrange's method of generalized coordinates. A general (dimensionless) valve equation of motion is developed, which is valid for most of the existing check valve types. Basic differential equations are derived for the transient flow in a pipe with constant initial flow deceleration. The equations are applied to describe the check valve closure under reflection free and reflecting boundary conditions in the form of dimensionless, analytical equations. The theory is based on conventional waterhammer theory. The pipe and valve equations are coupled via the integral form of the momentum equation. The uncoupled and coupled, (dimensionless) pipe and valve equations show formally which (dimensionless) variables and valve, system and fluid parameters are relevant to the dynamic behaviour of check valves in pipeline systems. In that sense they are used in a dimensional analysis to develop (dimensionless) valve characteristics and dynamic scale laws. Based on the dimensionless valve characteristics, models for undamped and <b>damped</b> check <b>valves</b> are developed and implemented in the waterhammer computer code CVWP (Check Valve Waterhammer Program). Experiments are performed in the test facility at Delft Hydraulics to measure several valve characteristics of weakly and strongly <b>damped</b> check <b>valves.</b> The dynamic scale laws are validated by means of numerical simulations. The valve models are validated against experimental data. The study has been performed within the Check Valve Research Project (CVRP) ...|$|R

Most VAV hoods integrate a modified bypass-block system that ensures adequate airflow at all sash positions.

40|$|Design of {{a vehicle}} {{suspension}} involves a difficult compromise among the ride, handling and directional control performance characteristics. While a soft suspension is desired to enhance ride quality, hard suspension springs are required to achieve good handling and directional control performance. Auxiliary roll stiffeners, in conjunction with soft suspension, are frequently used to attain an acceptable compromise between ride and handling performance {{of a vehicle}}. Alternatively, an improved compromise between ride and handling can be realized by interconnecting hydro-pneumatic suspension struts in the roll plane. The interconnected suspension can provide soft suspension rate for improved ride quality, and firm roll stiffness and damping for adequate handling and control performance. In this dissertation, a hydro-pneumatic suspension, interconnected in the roll plane, is analytically investigated for its ride and handling performance potentials. A highway bus equipped with the interconnected hydro-pneumatic suspension system is modeled in the roll plane as a four-degrees-of-freedom dynamical system subject to excitations arising from road irregularities and roll moment caused by directional maneuvers. The static and dynamic properties of the interconnected suspension are derived and {{discussed in terms of}} its load-carrying capacity, suspension rate, roll stiffness, and damping forces. The ride and handling performance characteristics of the interconnected suspension are deterministic excitations. A passive variable damping mechanism is proposed and investigated to achieve improved vehicle ride quality. The vibration isolation performance characteristics of the interconnected suspension employing the variable <b>damping</b> <b>valves</b> are further investigated for deterministic and random excitations. From the computer simulation results, it is concluded that the interconnected hydro-pneumatic suspension with inherent enhanced anti-roll stiffness and damping characteristics can provide an improved compromise between ride comfort and handling performance of a vehicle...|$|R

Ãhlins have been developing shock absorbers for more than 30 years {{and in addition to}} this they also develop a technology for semi-active suspension. Semi-active suspension technology makes it possible to achieve an intelligent and dynamic vehicle chassis control. Compared to standard passive suspensions, semiactive dampers allow improving vehicle cornering performance while still providing good comfort when cruising. This is achieved by a real time adjustment of the suspensions damping characteristics. Ãhlins system for semi-active suspension is called CES (Continuously controlled Electronic Suspension). The systems consist of electronically controlled hydraulic valves for uniflow dampers. These valves are mounted on all four dampers of the vehicle and are controlled individually to provide the desired ride quality. The valves are configurable to suit many types of vehicles by changing internal parts. The first goal of this thesis project was to study the behaviour of the CES <b>valve</b> and uniflow <b>damper.</b> In order to achieve this a simulation model was created using Hopsan which is a 1 -dimensional multi-domain modelling tool developed at the division of Fluid and Mechatronic Systems at LinkÃ¶ping University. The model considers mechanical forces from for example springs together with hydraulic forces. It was validated against static and dynamic measurements made in a flow bench and a dynamometer. The second goal was to use the simulation model as part of a tool that configures the CES valve according to a requirements specification. To achieve this goal a method of estimating the characteristics of the internal <b>damper</b> <b>valves</b> was developed. This estimation method, together with the simulation model, was used to choose the best valve configuration by using weighted least-squares.

40|$|Testing of the {{prototype}} valve began during this quarter. The {{objective of the}} first preliminary tests {{was to determine the}} pressure drop that can be created across the valve under different conditions of flow and pressure. As described in Quarterly Report 3, the system uses pneumatic pressure to activate a cylinder which in turn loads two hydraulic cylinders containing the MR fluid. Testing was preformed with no sensors or gauges other than the air pressure supply gauge. The valve was powered at 36 volts and drew about 3. 5 amps. The valve held back the MR fluid at 30 psi. (This is the air pressure required to get the cylinders to move without any flow obstruction.) The air pressure was then increased gradually until the valve could no longer hold back the MR pressure and the cylinders moved slowly. The maximum air pressure that could be held without movement of the cylinders was 85 psi; however. as much as 30 psi of this pressure may be required to overcome stiction. Thus, the maximum pressure we were able to stop was somewhere between 55 and 85 psi of air. This translates into 1500 to 2330 psi MR fluid pressure. Based on the ratio of the piston area to that of the MR <b>damper</b> <b>valve,</b> this in turn translates to a force of 9, 700 to 15, 000 pounds. A force of this magnitude is what is required for operation of the damper under typical downhole conditions. Initial testing indicates that a valve capable of producing the required damping under the anticipated downhole conditions is technically feasible. The project is progressing, but behind schedule, and a four-month extension of Phase I is being requested. This extension will not alter the budget for Phase I and is expected to have no significant effect upon the overall program schedule or budget...|$|R

40|$|A full {{nonlinear}} physical âin-serviceâ {{model was}} built for a rail vehicle secondary suspension hydraulic <b>damper</b> with shim-pack-type <b>valves.</b> In the modelling process, a shim pack deflection theory with an equivalent-pressure correction factor was proposed, and a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) approach was applied. Bench test results validated the damper model over its full velocity range and thus also proved that the proposed shim pack deflection theory and the FEA-based parameter identification approach are effective. The validated full damper model was subsequently incorporated into a detailed vehicle dynamics simulation to study how its key in-service parameter variations influence the secondary-suspension-related vehicle system dynamics. The obtained nonlinear physical in-service damper model and the vehicle dynamic response characteristics in this study {{could be used in}} the product design optimization and nonlinear optimal specifications of high-speed rail hydraulic dampers...|$|R
50|$|A <b>damper</b> is a <b>valve</b> or {{plate that}} stops or regulates {{the flow of}} air inside a duct, chimney, VAV box, air handler, or other air-handling equipment. A damper {{may be used to}} cut off central air {{conditioning}} (heating or cooling) to an unused room, or to regulate it for room-by-room temperature and climate control. Its operation can be manual or automatic. Manual dampers are turned by a handle on the outside of a duct. Automatic dampers are used to regulate airflow constantly and are operated by electric or pneumatic motors, in turn controlled by a thermostat or building automation system. Automatic or motorized dampers may also be controlled by a solenoid, and the degree of air-flow calibrated, perhaps according to signals from the thermostat going to the actuator of the damper in order to modulate the flow of air-conditioned air in order to effect climate control.|$|R
40|$|Conventional lag dampers use passive materials, such as elastomers, to dissi-pate {{energy and}} provide {{stiffness}}, but their damping and stiffness levels diminish markedly as amplitude of damper motion increases. Magnetorheological (MR) fluids based dampers have controllable damping {{with little or}} no stiffness. In order to combine the advantages of both elastomeric materials and MR flu-ids, semi-active magnetorheological fluid elastomeric (MRFE) lag dampers are developed in this thesis. In such a <b>damper</b> configuration, magnetic <b>valves</b> are in-corporated into the chamber enclosed by elastomeric layers. Preliminary MRFE damper design analysis was conducted using quasi-steady Bingham-plastic MR flow mode analysis, and MRFE damper performance was evaluated analytically. To investigate the feasibility of using a combination of magnetorheological (MR) fluids and elastomeric materials for augmentation of lag mode damping in heli-copters, a semi-active linear stroke MRFE lag damper was developed as a retrofit to an existing elastomeric helicopter lag damper. Consistent with sinusoidal load-ing conditions for a helicopter lag damper, single frequency (lag/rev) and dua...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{original}} design procedure for semiactive suspension systems. Firstly, we consider a target active control law {{that takes the}} form of a feedback control law. Secondly, we approximate the target law by controlling the damper coefficient f of the semiactive suspension. In particular, we examine two different kinds of shock absorbers: the first one uses magneto-rheological fluid instead of oil, while the second one is a solenoid <b>valve</b> <b>damper.</b> In both cases the nonlinear characteristics force-velocity of the damper are used to approximate the target law. To improve the efficiency of the proposed system, we take into account the updating frequency of the coefficient f and compute the expected value of f using a predictive procedure. We also address the problem of designing an asymptotic state observer that can be used not only to estimate the current state but also to predict the value that the state will take at the next sampling time...|$|R
40|$|The {{coronary}} ischemic {{disease is}} characterized by change of blood flow turbulence and, as a result, by appearance of high-frequency sounds that are caused by stenosis of arteries. The most informative part of this signal, which is used for diagnostics of the coronary ischemic disease, is the diastole. In order to extract the diastole from the entire signal, the moments, which correspond to {{the beginning and the}} end of a flap of the mitral <b>valve</b> <b>damper,</b> have to be determined. These moments can be detected as change-points of probabilistic characteristics of the signal, especially, as change-points of the spectral density of the signal. A training sample is formed from the extracted stationary fragments of the diastole for the healthy men and men with the coronary ischemic disease. The training sample is used for construction of a decision rule. In the paper the method for segmentation of the blood flow signal based on a spectral test for change-points detection is considered. The proposed decision rule is based on discriminant analysis of parameters of autoregressive models, which describe stationary fragments of the diastole...|$|R
