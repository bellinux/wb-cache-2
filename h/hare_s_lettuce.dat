The {{goal of the}} study was to elucidate the global modulation of bacteria and plant protein expression after Salmonella internalizes lettuce. A quantitative proteomic approach was used to analyse the protein expression of Salmonella enterica serovar Infantis and lettuce cultivar Green Salad Bowl 24 h after infiltrating <b>S.</b> Infantis into <b>lettuce</b> leaves. Among the 50 differentially expressed proteins identified by comparing internalized S. Infantis against S.

On the other hand, among the 20 differentially expressed lettuce proteins, proteins involved in defense response to bacteria were up-regulated. Moreover, the secreted effector PipB 2 of S.

This advice is usually coupled with the practice of shifting the investor's portfolio from risky asset holdings towards bonds and cash as the investor's target date gets closer.

In this study, soilborne disease suppressive ability of seven water ACTs, extracted from five horticultural residue-based composts, from an animal waste anaerobic solid digestate {{and from a}} commercial municipal waste compost, was assessed using in vitro and in vivo systems. All the ACTs inhibited in vitro growth of Verticillium dahliae, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici, Rhizoctonia solani, Sclerotinia minor, Sclerotium rolfsii and Botrytis cinerea. Filter or thermal sterilization eliminated in vitro suppression, suggesting that microorganisms play key roles in pathogen inhibition. Drenching applications of raw ACTs have potential to reduced disease symptoms caused by R. solani on savoy cabbage, <b>S.</b> minor on <b>lettuce</b> and <b>S.</b> rolfsii on pepper, improved the biomass production and did not show any sign of phytotoxicity.

Both "T. paraluisleporis" and T. paraluiscuniculi are clustered together indicating their common origin. The close phylogenetic relatedness of both representatives supports the conclusion that subspecies or ecovar status {{should be given to}} these strains rather than species status. A more appropriate species name might be Treponema paraluisleporidarum. The genitive refers to the nominative Leporidae (family of rabbits and hares). The naturally occurring strain in rabbits would than be T. paraluisleporidarum ecovar Cuniculus and the strain from hares T. paraluisleporidarum ecovar Lepus. Since the former seems to have fewer physiological hosts, ecovar Lepus may represent an evolutionary ancestor of ecovar Cuniculus. Copyright © 2013. Published by Elsevier B. V.

This organism was resistant to gentamicin, and the MIC of 2 '-N-ethylnetilmicin for it was fourfold lower than that of 6 '-N-ethylnetilmicin, a resistance pattern which suggested 2 '-acetylating activity. However, high-pressure liquid chromatography analysis demonstrated that the enzyme acetylated sisomicin in the 3 position. We have cloned the structural gene for this enzyme from a large (> 70 -kb) conjugative plasmid present in E. cloacae. Subcloning experiments have localized the aac(3) -VIa gene to a 2. 1 -kb Sau 3 A fragment.

40|$|Copyright © 2003 The American Association for Thoracic SurgeryOBJECTIVE: The {{aim was to}} prospectively analyze all-cause mortality, {{predictors}} of survival, and late functional results after myocardial revascularization for ischemic cardiomyopathy over a 10 -year follow-up. METHODS: We prospectively studied 57 patients with stable coronary artery disease and poor left ventricular ejection function (< 35 %), enrolled between 1989 and 1994. Stress thallium was analyzed in 37 patients to identify reversible ischemia. To avoid patients with a stunned myocardium, we excluded those with unstable angina or myocardial infarction within the previous 4 weeks. Mean age of the patients was 67 ± 8 years, and 93 % of patients were men. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 0. 28 ± 0. 04, 50 % were in Canadian Cardiovascular Society angina class III-IV, and 65 % were in New York Heart Association functional class III-IV. RESULTS: Operative mortality was 1. 7 % (1 / 57). The mean left ventricular ejection fraction (0. 30) at 15 months postoperatively did not change from before operation (0. 28, P =. 09). There were 8 deaths at 1 year and 42 deaths {{over the course of}} the study, producing a survival of 82. 5 % at 1 year, 55. 7 % at 5 years, and 23. 9 % at 10 years (95 % confidence interval: 14. 6 %- 39. 1 %). Symptom-free survival was 77. 2 % at 1 year and 20. 3 % at 10 years. The leading cause of death was heart failure in 29 % (12 / 42). Multivariate analysis showed that large reversible defects on stress thallium were associated with improved left ventricular ejection fraction at 1 year (P =. 01) but only male sex was associated with improved long-term survival (P =. 036). CONCLUSIONS: Myocardial revascularization for ischemic cardiomyopathy is associated with good functional relief from the symptoms of angina initially and, to a lesser extent, heart failure. Revascularization may have the advantage of preserving the remaining left ventricular function. However, the long-term mortality remains high. Pallav J.

40|$|Recently, most {{foodborne}} illness outbreaks of salmonellosis {{have been caused}} by consumption of contaminated fresh produce. Yet, the mechanisms that allow the human pathogen Salmonella enterica to contaminate and grow in plant environments remain poorly described. We examined the effect of feeding by phytophagous insects on survival of <b>S.</b> enterica on <b>lettuce.</b> Larger <b>S.</b> enterica populations were found on leaves infested with Macrosteles quadrilineatus. In contrast, pathogen populations among plants exposed to Frankliniella occidentalis or Myzus persicae were similar to those without insects. However, on plants infested with F. occidentalis, areas of the infested leaf with feeding damage sustained higher S. enterica populations than areas without damage. The spatial distribution of S. enterica cells on leaves infested with F. occidentalis may be altered resulting in higher populations in feeding lesions or survival may be different across a leaf dependent on local damage. Results suggest the possibility of some specificity with select insects and the persistence of S. enterica. Additionally, we demonstrated the potential for phytophagous insects to become contaminated with S. enterica from contaminated plant material. S. enterica was detected in approximately 50 % of all M. quadrilineatus, F. occidentalis, and M. persicae after 24 h exposure to contaminated leaves. Particularly, 17 % of F. occidentalis, the smallest of the insects tested, harbored more than 10 (2) CFU/F. occidentalis.

Known as the nation’s salad bowl, and producing up to 90 % of U. <b>S.</b> production of <b>lettuces,</b> broccoli and Brussels sprouts, this region is a mosaic of fresh vegetable fields, coastal meadow, chaparral shrubs, riparian and woodland habitat. We tested for relationships between the percent cover of crops, riparian and other natural landscape vegetation and the species richness of parasitic wasps and flies foraging in crops, such as broccoli, kale and cauliflower, and interpreted our results {{with respect to the}} decrease in natural habitat and increase in cropland cover prompted by a local microbial contamination event in 2006. Our key results are that: (1) as cropland cover in the landscape increased, fewer species of parasitoids were captured in the crop field, (2) parasitoid richness overall was positively associated with the amount of riparian and other natural vegetation in the surrounding 500 m, (3) different groups of parasitoids were associated with unique types of natural vegetation, and (4) parasitism rates of sentinel cabbage aphid and cabbage looper pests were correlated with landscape vegetation features according to which parasitoids caused the mortality. Although individual species of parasitoids may thrive in landscapes that are predominantly short season crops, the robust associations found in this study across specialist and generalist parasitoids and different taxa (tachinid flies, ichneumon wasps, braconid wasps) shows that recent food safety practices targeting removal of natural vegetation around vegetable fields in an attempt to eliminate wildlife may harm natural enemy communities and reduce ecosystem services.

Results from field experiments revealed that two applications of C. minitans at manufacturer recommended rates significantly reduced the incidence of lettuce drop caused by S. sclerotiorum but not by S. minor. Applications of other biocontrol products tested did not significantly reduce disease incidence caused by either pathogen. Sclerotium population studies revealed that soil populations of <b>S.</b> sclerotiorum in <b>lettuce</b> production fields ranged from 0. 08 to 2. 9 sclerotia/ 100 g of soil and were generally aggregated in their distribution. Continued field studies revealed that there was no significant effect of irrigation (sprinkler vs furrow) on either the impact of sclerotium density or the efficacy of C. minitans. Studies on the evaluation of different application rates of Contans against S. minor revealed that two applications of Contans at 5 X manufactures recommended rates significantly reduced the disease incidence. Examination of sclerotial exudates of Sclerotinia spp. revealed that crude exudates from both Sclerotinia spp. stimulated C. minitans spore germination and the stimulation was due to compounds within the polar fraction. Studies on the role of lectin-carbohydrate binding during fungal-mycoparasite interactions revealed that many plant lectins as well as crude proteins extracted from sclerotia of either Sclerotinia spp. induced agglutination of C. minitans spores in vitro. Spore germination of C. minitans stimulated by sclerotial exudates of either Sclerotinia spp. was significantly inhibited {{in the presence of the}} lectin Con A but not other plant lectins.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of organic soil amendments against S. sclerotiorum, {{the cause of}} soft rot of lettuce, and similar diseases {{of a range of}} other crops, was evaluated in the glasshouse and in the field. Stem rot of tomato, also caused by S. sclerotiorum, was also studied under field conditions. Lucerne hay, stable manure and fowl manure greatly suppressed disease incidence caused by <b>S.</b> sclerotiorum in <b>lettuce</b> and tomato crops. These amendments significantly reduced sclerotium numbers remaining in the soil after crop harvest. This was observed in the field and in glasshouse experiments. Incorporation of organic amendments, in particular lucerne hay, stable manure and fowl manure, significantly increased the number and fresh weight of marketable lettuce heads and the number and fresh weight of marketable tomato fruit. There was 100 % germination when sclerotia were added to soil extract and distilled water. Aqueous leachates from lucerne hay, stable manure and cow manure, however, substantially reduced the viability of sclerotia of S. sclerotiorum. Sclerotium viability was reduced when tomato stems infested with S. sclerotiorum were buried in a compost heap (internal temperature 50 - 600 C) and composted for seven weeks. There was a 100 % kill of sclerotia isolated from infested material and buried in the compost heap, 98 % kill of sclerotia incubated in an oven at 40 C compared to 10 % reduction in viability of those isolated from non-composted infected tomato stems. Organic amendments generally reduced the number of sclerotia in the soil over the experimental period. Disease incidence reflected levels of sclerotia in soil. The presence of organic substrate combined with high moisture levels, high relative humidity, and mild temperature suppressed Sclerotinia diseases, delayed onset of disease in some seasons and decreased the rate of disease development in lettuce and tomatoes.

As malhas termorrefletoras e difusora foram instaladas em estruturas tipo telados retangulares fechados, com 2 x 4 x 36 m (altura, largura e comprimento). A semeadura foi realizada em bandejas de 200 células, preenchidas com substrato comercial, sob ambiente protegido, em 31 / 05 / 02. O transplante foi realizado em 26 / 06 / 02 e a colheita em 06 / 08 / 02, ocasião em que foram feitas as avaliações. Avaliou-se a produção de biomassa, teor de nitrato, teores e exportação de macronutrientes. 'Regina' apresentou folhas mais tenras do que a 'Verônica', portanto mais adequadas a mercados mais exigentes, porém, com maior teor de nitrato. Considerando os aspectos quantitativo e qualitativo da produção sugere-se o uso das malhas Aluminet® 40 %-O e ChromatiNet Difusor® 30 %; todavia, deve-se ajustar adequadamente a adubação nitrogenada para que não haja acúmulo de nitrato a níveis elevados devido a restrição de luz promovida pelas malhas.

The transplant was accomplished on 06 / 26 / 02 and the harvest on 08 / 06 / 02, when the evaluations were performed. The thermo-reflective and diffusive screens were installed in structures type 'shut rectangular fence', with 2 x 4 x 36 m (height, width and length), close to the cultivation under open sky (control). We evaluated the production of mass, content of nitrate, content and exportable mineral nutrient (N, P, K, Ca, Mg e S). 'Regina' presented more tender leaves than the 'Verônica', therefore being more appropriate to the high quality demanding markets, even so, with larger content of nitrate. Considering the quantitative and qualitative aspects, the Aluminet® 40 % and ChromatiNet Difusor® 30 % screens should be recommended; though, the nitrogen should be adjusted to avoid the accumulation of nitrate. The growing conditions and cultivars influenced content and exportable mineral nutrients. With relation to the export of nutrients the following order was observed: K>N>Ca>P>Mg>S...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Grazing by {{livestock}} {{is used as}} {{a management}} tool to prevent the dominance of a single tall-growing species during succession on European salt marshes. The effects of natural small herbivores are often neglected by managers. Long-term exclosure experiments on the island of Schier-monnikoog show that hares retard vegetation succession at the early stages of salt-marsh development. In the present study we test whether we can scale-up these exclosure stud-ies to a whole salt-marsh system. We compared 30 years of undisturbed vegetation succession at the Wadden Sea islands of Schiermonnikoog, Rottumerplaat (both The Netherlands) and Mellum (Germany). Salt-marsh development started at all sites in the early 1970 <b>s.</b> <b>Hares</b> have been present only on Schiermonnikoog. At each site an area was selected covering a gradient from high to low salt marsh. Surface elevation and clay thickness were measured and a vegetation map was made on the three islands. The areas showed similar clay thickness at low surface elevation, indicating similar sedi-mentation rates and hence nitrogen inputs. Rottumerplaat and Mellum showed a higher dominance of the late succes-sional species Atriplex portulacoides in the low marsh and Elymus athericus in the high marsh compared to Schiermon-nikoog. Typical mid-successional, important food plant species for hares and geese had a higher abundance at Schier-monnikoog. Patterns of vegetation development in the ab-sence of hares followed the observed patterns in the small-scale exclosure experiments at Schiermonnikoog. Without hare grazing, vegetation succession proceeds more rapidly and leads to the dominance of tall-growing species in earlier stages of succession. The present study shows that next to large herbivores, small herbivores potentially have large-scale effects on salt-marsh vegetation succession during the early successional stages...|$|R
40|$|Lettuce drop, {{caused by}} the soil borne {{pathogen}} Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, {{is one of the}} most common and serious diseases of lettuce worldwide. Increased concerns about the side effects of chemical pesticides have resulted in greater interest in developing biocontrol strategies against S. sclerotiorum. However, relatively little is known about the mechanisms of Streptomyces spp. as biological control agents against <b>S.</b> sclerotiorum on <b>lettuce.</b> Two Streptomyces isolates, S. exfoliatus FT 05 W and S. cyaneus ZEA 17 I, inhibit mycelial growth of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum by more than 75 % in vitro. We evaluated their biocontrol activity against S. sclerotiorum in vivo, and compared them to Streptomyces lydicus WYEC 108, isolated from Actinovate®. When Streptomyces spp. (106 CFU/mL) were applied to S. sclerotiorum inoculated substrate in a growth chamber one week prior lettuce sowing, they significantly reduced the risk of lettuce drop disease, compared to the inoculated control. Interestingly, under field conditions, S. exfoliatus FT 05 W and S. cyaneus ZEA 17 I protected lettuce from drop by 40 % and 10 % respectively, whereas S. lydicus WYEC 108 did not show any protection. We further labeled S. exfoliatus FT 05 W and S. cyaneus ZEA 17 I with the enhanced GFP (EGFP) marker to investigate their rhizosphere competence and ability to colonize lettuce roots using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The abundant colonization of young lettuce seedlings by both strains demonstrated Streptomyces’ capability to interact with the host from early stages of seed germination and root development. Moreover, the two strains were detected also on two-week-old roots, indicating their potential of long-term interactions with lettuce. Additionally, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations showed EGFP-S. exfoliatus FT 05 W endophytic colonization of lettuce root cortex tissues. Finally, we determined its viability and persistence in the rhizosphere and endorhiza up to three weeks by quantifying its concentration in these compartments. Based on these results we conclude that S. exfoliatus FT 05 W has high potential to be exploited in agriculture for managing soil borne diseases barely controlled by available plant protection products...|$|R

As cultivares de tomate e alface foram, respectivamente, Débora Max e Vera. A produtividade {{comercial}} do tomateiro, bem como a classificação de frutos de tomate não foram influenciadas pela presença da alface. Entretanto, a produtividade da alface foi menor no cultivo consorciado do que em monocultivo e quanto mais tardio o transplantio da alface em relação ao tomateiro, maior foi a redução no acúmulo de massa seca de plantas de alface. Os consórcios estabelecidos com o transplantio da alface até 14 dias após o transplantio do tomateiro obtiveram os melhores resultados segundo o índice de Uso Eficiente da Terra. This {{work was}} carried out at UNESP, Jaboticabal-SP, in two times of cultivation, July to November of 2001 and February to August of 2002, with objective to evaluate the productivity of tomato and lettuce crops in intercropping, in function {{of the time of}} establishment of intercropping (time of <b>lettuce</b> <b>s</b> transplanting). Nine treatments were evaluated, with the intercropping and monoculture of lettuce at zero, 14, 28 and 42 days after the transplant of tomato. The cultivars of tomato and lettuce were, respectively, Debora Max and Vera. The commercial productivity of tomato, as well as the classification of tomato fruits were influenced by the presence of the lettuce. However, the productivity of the lettuce was smaller in the intercropping cultivation and so much than later was the transplant of the lettucein relation to tomato crop. The intercropping established with the transplant of the lettuce over to 14 days affter transplant of tomato showed the best results according to index of Efficient Use of the Land...|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} {{rates of}} population growth and urbanization worldwide {{raises the question of}} food security and self-reliance in cities. In view of this situation, in recent years there has been a re-emergence of urban agriculture in its traditional form and in new variations, such as on urban rooftops. A number of rooftop urban farms exist in the world; however, very few studies have been done to establish the quality of crops they produce, specifically concerning the concentrations of contaminants. The main {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate levels of contamination in edible plants grown on urban rooftops. I determined concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and trace metals in the biomass of three types of horticultural crops grown in the city of Helsinki, Finland. Lettuce, radish and peas were planted on five rooftops in various areas of Helsinki and control samples were acquired from local food stores and markets. Both groups of crops were analyzed for concentrations of 11 trace elements using the Elan 6000 ICP-MS and 16 PAHs using Shimadzu GC-MS-QP 2010 Ultra system with the AOC- 20 i /AOC- 20 <b>s</b> autosampler. Additionally, <b>lettuce</b> and pea samples from the roofs were analyzed washed and unwashed to establish levels of particulate contamination on the surface of plants that can be mechanically removed through washing. Results obtained suggest that concentrations of PAHs and trace metals in rooftop vegetables in Helsinki are very low and the differences in their concentrations compared to control (store) samples are insignificant. This demonstrates that the consumption of vegetables produced in uncontaminated soil on urban roofs in Helsinki is safe. All samples showed concentrations well below the safety limits for heavy metals and PAHs established in the European Union (EC, 2006). Finally, there was a difference in concentration of PAHs and trace metals between washed and unwashed samples, however most of the results did not show statistical significance...|$|R
40|$|A {{taxonomic study}} was {{conducted}} of 48 isolates of plant pathogenic Stemphylium Wallroth species, all of which produced a Pleospora Rabenhorst perfect state in culture. Specific identification was attempted using gross colony characters and morphological features of the imperfect and perfect states. Only conidial and ascospore features proved to be of taxonomic value. The diagnostic conidial features were shape, dimensions, length/width ratio, number of longitudinal and lateral septa, number of lateral septal constrictions, ornamentations and pigmentation. Ascospore features of taxonomic significance were dimensions, and shape of both juvenile and mature spores. On {{the basis of these}} criteria it was concluded that three Stemphylium species were present, namely Stemphylium botryosum Wallroth, Stemphylium globuliferum (Vestergen) Simmons, and Stemphylium vesicarium (Wallroth) Simmons, each with a corresponding Pleospora state. This cross-pairing had value since identification of form-species allowed reliable prediction of the Pleospora species, and vice-versa. The cultural conditions providing the best expression of conidial features (and thus facilitating separation of Stemphylium species) were 5 % V- 8 agar, pH 7. 5, 20 C and an 8 h photoperiod. Synchronous production of conidia was induced with an injury technique and ascostromata were matured most rapidly at either 12 C or a diurnal temperature regime of 8 h at 16 C/ 16 h at 8 C. A taxonomic survey of 166 Stemphylium isolates from 12 host species revealed the three previously mentioned species and a further undescribed species. The latter was isolated from annual phlox and was characterized by exceptionally large ascospores. S. vesicarium was by far the most common species, occurring on asparagus, chrysanthemum, blue lupin, Russell lupin, tree lupin, onion, pepper and tomato. The legumes were hosts of more than one species; lucerne for instance was a host for S. botryosum, S. globuliferum and S. vesicarium, while Russell lupin and tree lupin were only infected by S. botryosum. and S. vesicarium. By contrast, lettuce and carnation were only infected by S. botryosum. Cross-pathogenicity tests indicated that host specialization was relatively uncommon. <b>S.</b> botryosum from <b>lettuce</b> and the Stemphylium sp. from annual phlox were the only isolates exhibiting host specificity. The results of ultrastructural studies of conidiogenesis, the phenomenon of vegetative reversion of conidiophores and juvenile conidia, and the mechanism of ascospore release in Pleospora are discussed. A previously undescribed, saprophytic, chain-forming species of Stemphylium is also described...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Fresh-cut produce {{graduated}} to retail during the 1990 <b>s,</b> especially for <b>lettuce,</b> cabbage, carrots {{and other similar}} vegetables. The high microbial loads of these products after harvest can be substantially reduced through a cleaning in flowing chlorinated water and adistribution under ensured controlledrefrigeration. Therefore, {{a good number of}} convenient ready-to-use greens were launched to the market in the past decade. Nowadays, theuse of this technology to achieve similar results in fruit products {{is one of the most}} challengingtargets for processors. However, there is anumber of issues that still need to beovercomebeforefresh-cut fruit commodities can be sparked off to anoutstanding position in the segment of lightly-treatedrefrigerated foods. The importance of freshly cut products increases day by day. Tissue and cell rupture leads to a decrease in the shelf life of these products. On the other hand, these products due to increased enzyme activity, respiration rate and microbiological considerations that affect the health of these productsrequires highly attention. To increase the shelf life of the products and prevent undesirable changes in cut slices of fruit or vegetables a coating on the surface of these products has been suggested. Mucilages and essential oils of herbs are natural compounds that can be used to create such covers. The advantages of these coatings are their bactericidal effect, maintenanceof pleasant taste and other physical and chemical characteristics of the product and even decrease of environmental pollution. In this research, the effect of natural compounds such as Zataria multiflora essential oil (EO) and Plantagopsyllium mucilage on storage life and microbial load of fresh cut carrot was studied. Materials and Methods: The research was conducted in two separate experiments on fresh-cut carrot: In the first experiment, the effect of different concentrations of Plantago psyllium mucilage (0, 100, 200, and 400 mgL- 1) and four concentrations of Zataria multiflora essential oil (0, 100, 250,and 500 mgL- 1), in a factorial experiment on the basis of completely randomized designwith 16 treatments and three replications was evaluated. In the second experiment application of essential oil and mucilage on microbial load of fresh-cut carrot was examined in a split plot experiment on the basis of randomized complete blocks design with six treatments and three replications which Zataria multiflora EO (500 mgL- 1) and Plantago psyllium mucilage (400 mgL- 1) was set as main plot and storage time was set as subplot. The serial dilution technique and cultivation in special culture media were used to determine the microbial load. Treated samples were then packaged in polyethylene trays (175 mL) and were stored at 4 °C. After 10 days of treatment different parameters such as weight loss, total soluble solids (TSS), titratable acidity (TA), pH, color, organoleptic properties, the amount of skin whitening and microbial load were evaluated. Means were compared using LSD test at the significant 5...|$|R
