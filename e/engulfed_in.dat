5|$|Numerous {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} attempting to explain his disappearance: that he committed suicide, was murdered by his Persian or Turkish enemies, or arrested and exiled to Siberia by the Special Corps of Gendarmes, among others. Given his love for his children and their young age, it is generally disregarded that Abovian committed suicide. Writer Axel Bakunts put forward the theory that Abovian was in Western Europe <b>engulfed</b> <b>in</b> the Revolutions of 1848.|$|E

In 1852, he led a Brazilian division during the Platine War in an invasion of the Argentine Confederation that overthrew its dictator.

5|$|Around 1:00am (evidence on {{the precise}} time conflicts) on Monday, 8 January, a {{rumbling}} or cracking noise was {{heard from the}} vessel, followed shortly by a huge explosion within its hull. The force of the explosion was seen to blow men from the jetty into the sea. Local residents reported seeing Betelgeuse <b>engulfed</b> <b>in</b> a ball of fire a few moments later. A series of further explosions followed, breaking the vessel in half. Much of the oil cargo still on board ignited and this generated temperatures estimated to exceed 1,000°C. The concrete unloading jetty crumbled and firefighters, arriving on the scene from several neighbouring towns, were unable to get near the vessel. The firefighters concentrated their efforts on preventing the fire from spreading to the tanks of the storage farm and on containing the oil spillage. Local families living on the island fled for their lives.|$|E

5|$|By 6:30am {{the fire}} was {{spreading}} very quickly through the building, although from the outside nothing was visible. Because of the wooden construction, the building was soon <b>engulfed</b> <b>in</b> flames. The guests on the top level could not escape and stood panicked in the windows. When the fire reached the rooms of some guests, they leaped out of the windows to escape. At 6:42 the first large fire engine arrived. On the street there lay several dead and injured people, who had jumped from their hotel room windows. On the lower floor, the furniture store Inden was also on fire. The fire fighters tried to fold out a life net in the Papenbroekssteeg (which runs between the Rokin and the Kalverstraat) but the alley was too narrow for it.|$|E
5|$|During June, {{there was}} {{speculation}} that Miller's squadron would be deployed to Burma {{to fight against}} Japan. In the meantime, the airmen continued to practice their flying, Miller earning Reeves' ire by making unauthorised leisure flights. Later, {{he was ordered to}} fly tour flights over Germany. Not wanting to do so, Miller lodged bogus reports saying that the Mosquitoes were malfunctioning, causing unnecessary maintenance work. Thus, Reeves ordered Miller to take his plane instead, which caught fire in mid-flight. With one functional engine and no navigator to assist him, Miller came back to the air base and bellylanded. The fuselage and one of the wings was broken off and the plane became <b>engulfed</b> <b>in</b> flames. Miller escaped physical injury, but was shaken by the accident. Again Miller escaped disciplinary action, and was playing sport an hour later.|$|E
5|$|In 1808, the Portuguese Royal Family {{arrived in}} Brazil, {{settling}} in Rio de Janeiro.

João's attempt at conquering the entire region met with failure. He launched another invasion a few years later, in 1816, who counted among their ranks Marques de Sousa's father and paternal grandfather. In 1817, around age 13, he asked his grandfather to allow him to fight in the war. The elder Marques de Sousa agreed, and the youngster learned guerrilla hit-and-run tactics on horseback near the border town of Jaguarão.|$|E

5|$|On April 25, 1935 at 6:43pm, a {{custodial}} engineer {{called the}} Salem Fire Department to report smoke.

Among the helping citizens was twelve-year-old Mark Hatfield, who later became governor. It was determined the fire started {{in the basement of}} the east wing and quickly spread to piles of old records. A strong updraft in the hollow columns enclosing the dome's eight supporting steel lattice girders pulled the flames through the rotunda to upper stories. The intense heat burned even the copper dome and lit the night sky.|$|E
5|$|The episode filmed {{for eight}} days. In one sequence, Carl Grimes sparks up a {{cigarette}} lighter and drops {{it onto a}} horde of walkers after Rick creates a diversion to distract the walkers. Greg Nicotero, the special effect director for The Walking Dead, used black panels to capture {{the elements of the}} fire; this enabled them to edit the flames onto the walkers. To reduce the chances of getting burned, the stuntmen put on several layers of flame retardant suits. The first layer consisted of a dry Nomex undergarment; this was followed by several layers of Nomex clothing that were gelled. Since the sequence was conducted on multiple occasions, the stuntmen were coated with gel containing cationic polymers. The last layer was a raincoat, which would separate the gel from the stuntmen's clothing and allowed them to be <b>engulfed</b> <b>in</b> flames for several seconds without injury.|$|E
