50|$|The {{ability of}} {{nanoparticles}} to carry and release drugs is also largely dependent on characteristics which {{result from the}} small size and unique surface {{area to volume ratio}} of nanoparticles. Nanoparticles can generally carry drugs in two ways: drugs can either be bound to the outside of the nanoparticles or packed within the polymeric matrix of the nanoparticles. Smaller nanoparticles have higher surface area ratios and can thus bind a high quantity of drug, while larger nanoparticles can encapsulate more of the drug within its core. The best method of <b>drug</b> <b>loading</b> is dependent on the structures of the drug to be bound. Also, <b>drug</b> <b>loading</b> can occur as the nanoparticles are produced, or the drugs can be added to pre-existing nanoparticles. The release of drugs, depends largely {{on the size of the}} nanoparticle carrying it. Because nanoparticles can be bound to the surface of nanoparticles, which is large relative to the volume of the particles, drugs can be released quickly. In contrast, drugs that are loaded within nanoparticles are released more slowly.|$|E
50|$|Nanocarriers {{range from}} sizes of {{diameter}} 1-1000 nm, however {{due to the}} width of microcapillaries being 200 nm, nanomedicine often refers to devices <200 nm. Because of their small size, nanocarriers can deliver drugs to otherwise inaccessible sites around the body. Since nanocarriers are so small, it is oftentimes difficult to provide large drug doses using them. The emulsion techniques used to make nanocarriers also often result in low <b>drug</b> <b>loading</b> and drug encapsulation, providing a difficulty for the clinical use.|$|E
30|$|In {{the current}} study, {{the use of}} more than one drug within a {{medication}} class greatly increased the <b>drug</b> <b>load.</b> Patients taking two antipsychotics, antidepressants, or benzodiazepines had about double the <b>drug</b> <b>load</b> of those taking one drug, similar to prior findings (Procyshyn et al. 2010; Tognoni 1999). This result suggests that within a medication class, increasing the dose of one drug produces a lower <b>drug</b> <b>load</b> than adding a second drug. In patients with epilepsy, anticonvulsant polypharmacy is associated with a much higher <b>drug</b> <b>load</b> than with monotherapy, and a higher <b>drug</b> <b>load</b> is associated with increased adverse events (Lammers et al. 1995; Deckers et al. 2001; Deckers 2002). In contrast to that in epilepsy, polypharmacy in bipolar disorder primarily involves drugs from more than one medication class, as with 70 % of the patients taking a stable combination in this study. There are few studies of the relation between <b>drug</b> <b>load</b> as measured by the PDD/DDD ratio and adverse events for psychotropic drugs. For example, while persistent exposure to antipsychotic polypharmacy increases the risk of adverse reactions (Carnahan et al. 2006; Centorrino et al. 2004), the optimal measure to predict adverse events is unclear (Barr et al. 2010; Nosè et al. 2008). However, the <b>drug</b> <b>load</b> concept may be useful for improving tolerability of polypharmacy in bipolar disorder, and investigation of the relation between <b>drug</b> <b>load</b> and adverse reactions is indicated.|$|R

Although the same fabrication conditions were used for preparing the <b>drug</b> <b>loaded</b> and unloaded microspheres, the presence of the drug changed the surface morphology and roughness of the films.

The in vitro biocompatibility of the films was investigated using a human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT) by comparing cell viability on the films to that on conventional tissue culture plastics. Both films appear to support cell growth but cell attachment and percentage cell viability were greater on the <b>drug</b> <b>loaded</b> films (32 % of control) compared to the unloaded film (10 % of control), possibly {{as a result of the}} non-uniform surface morphology and increased roughness of the <b>drug</b> <b>loaded</b> film.

Microneedles of approximately 100μm can penetrate the skin barrier and deliver drugs {{to the underlying}} cells and interstitial fluid with reduced tissue damage, reduced pain, and no bleeding. Microneedles can also be integrated with microfluidics for automated <b>drug</b> <b>loading</b> or multiplexing. From the user standpoint, microneedles {{can be incorporated into}} a patch format for self-administration, and do not constitute a sharp waste biohazard (if the material is polymeric). Drug delivery by microneedles include coating the surface with therapeutic agents, loading drugs into porous or hollow microneedles, or fabricating the microneedles with drug and coating matrix for maximum <b>drug</b> <b>loading.</b> Microneedles for interstitial fluid extraction, blood extraction, and gene delivery are also being developed. The efficiency of microneedle drug delivery remains a challenge because it is difficult to ascertain if the microneedles effectively penetrated the skin. Some drugs, such as diazepam, are poorly soluble and need to be aerosolized immediately prior to intranasal administration. Bio-MEMS technology using piezoelectric transducers to liquid reservoirs can be used in these circumstances to generate narrow size distribution of aerosols for better drug delivery. Implantable drug delivery systems have also been developed to administer therapeutic agents that have poor bioavailability or require localized release and exposure at a target site. Examples include a PDMS microfluidic device implanted under the conjunctiva for drug delivery to the eye to treat ocular diseases and microchips with gold-capped drug reservoirs for osteoporosis. In implantable bio-MEMS for drug delivery, {{it is important to consider}} device rupture and dose dumping, fibrous encapsulation of the device, and device explantation. Most drugs also need to be delivered in relatively large quantities (milliliters or even greater), which makes implantable bio-MEMS drug delivery challenging due to their limited drug-holding capacity.|$|E

The powder formulations were compacted to several relative densities with the Zwick material tester. The compaction force and tensile strength were fitted to several mathematical models that give representative factors for the powder compressibility. The factors k and C (Heckel and modified Heckel equation) showed mostly a nonlinear correlation with increasing <b>drug</b> <b>load.</b> The biggest drop in both factors occurred at far regions and <b>drug</b> <b>load</b> ranges. This outcome is crucial because in binary mixtures the <b>drug</b> <b>load</b> regions with higher changeover of plotted factors could be a hint for an existing percolation threshold. The susceptibility value (Leuenberger equation) showed varying values for each formulation without the expected trend of decrease for higher <b>drug</b> <b>loads.</b> The outcomes of this study showed the main challenges for good formulation design.

Hernia incidents rates are 27% for males and 3% for females over there lifespan, with complications ranging from associated with mild pain, poor quality-of-life for the patient and in rare causes potentially fatal. According to USA healthcare vital statistics between 2000 and 2009 16438 people died due to hernia related complications. Thus, leading to enormous healthcare costs, exceeding US $48 billion in the US annually. At present, hernia operations rely heavily on non-degradable polypropylene, polytetrafluoroethylene and nylon meshes. Complications associate with meshes include “adverse reactions to the mesh, adhesions (when the loops of the intestines adhere to each other or the mesh), and injuries to nearby organs, nerves or blood vessels. Other complications of hernia repair can occur with or without the mesh, including infection, chronic pain and hernia recurrence.” However, these polymers are often associated with foreign body reaction; implant failure; and hernia recurrence (over 42%). Moreover, leaking chemicals of these polymers are often deleterious to the surrounding cells and tissue and immobilise post-operative drug treatments.

50|$|Drug {{delivery}} is {{a rapidly growing}} area that is now taking advantage of nanotube technology. Systems being used currently for drug delivery include dendrimers, polymers, and liposomes, but carbon nanotubes present {{the opportunity to work}} with effective structures that have high <b>drug</b> <b>loading</b> capacities and good cell penetration qualities. These nanotubes function with a larger inner volume to be used as the drug container, large aspect ratios for numerous functionalization attachments, and the ability to be readily taken up by the cell. Because of their tube structure, carbon nanotubes can be made with or without end caps, meaning that without end caps the inside where the drug is held would be more accessible. Right now with carbon nanotube drug delivery systems, problems arise like the lack of solubility, clumping occurrences, and half-life. However, these are all issues that are currently being addressed and altered for further advancements in the carbon nanotube field. The advantages of carbon nanotubes as nanovectors for drug delivery remain where cell uptake of these structures was demonstrated efficiently where the effects were prominent, showing the particular nanotubes can be less harmful as nenovehicles for drugs. Also, drug encapsulation has been shown to enhance water dispersibility, better bioavailability, and reduced toxicity. Encapsulation of molecules also provides a material storage application as well as protection and controlled release of loaded molecules. All of these result in a good drug delivery basis where further research and understanding could improve upon numerous other advancements, like increased water solubility, decreased toxicity, sustained half-life, increased cell penetration and uptake, all of which are currently novel but undeveloped ideas.|$|E
