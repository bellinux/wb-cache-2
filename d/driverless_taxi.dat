50|$|ZMP is {{also working}} {{together}} with Sony in another area. Google is working on automobile technology, self-driving cars and even perhaps a <b>driverless</b> <b>taxi</b> service. More recently Apple was rumoured (later confirmed) {{to be working on}} electric vehicles (iCar/Project Titan) to rival those made by the likes of Tesla. Sony hopes to do well from this emerging self-driving automotive industry and has therefore invested $842,000 in ZMP.|$|E
5000|$|In 2016 Young {{released}} the science fiction short film Where The City Cant See [...] The short {{is the first}} fiction film to be shot entirely using laser scanning technology (LIDAR), the same vision system that driverless cars use to navigate. The story follows {{a group of young}} factory workers across a single night as they drift through a near future Detroit in a <b>driverless</b> <b>taxi.</b> They are part of an underground community that have developed new textiles for digital camouflage which they use to escape the surveillance systems of the city and seek out a hidden rave party in the abandoned industrial factories of Detroit. The film features an original soundtrack by DJ Stingray, former tour DJ for Detroit electronic band Drexciya.|$|E
30|$|The {{concept of}} driverless taxis is {{analogous}} to car-sharing which is a thriving business model. AVs can boost car and ride sharing schemes as they can cater to multiple persons on demand [1]. Consequently, households may find driverless taxis more convenient and cheaper to hire than owning a vehicle. Furthermore, compared to car-sharing, driverless taxis should not be costlier. Given {{the fact that the}} <b>driverless</b> <b>taxi</b> obviates the need for annual fixed costs and maintenance normally associated with car-sharing as well as parking, it would provide even greater convenience. In actual fact, car-sharing has recently been found to lower VKT in the United States market [49]. Nevertheless, as previously mentioned, cheaper rides would be accompanied by new demands, especially from destitute (low-income) people who can now afford to either drive or to take a cab.|$|E
30|$|AV {{technologies}} can be {{conducive to}} <b>driverless</b> <b>taxis</b> or similar car-sharing schemes {{in which the}} cost of compensating cabdrivers’ time and talent is excluded. As a result, driverless cabs are expected to become cheaper and which eventually may discourage car ownership.|$|R
30|$|All in all, AVs possess great {{potential}} to lower many {{costs associated with}} private modes as {{they are likely to}} instigate more trips, resulting in growth in VKT. AVs may also instigate an emergence in <b>driverless</b> <b>taxis</b> for which the ultimate effect on VKT is still unclear.|$|R
30|$|The family {{enjoys the}} almost silent journey in the {{separate}} taxi lane. Journey times have fallen dramatically {{because of the}} taxi lane, and accidents have become a rarity. The city centre {{has been turned into}} a pilot area for testing autonomous transport systems, and is even closed off to private cars. Most passenger and goods transportation takes place via autonomous and <b>driverless</b> <b>taxis,</b> buses, trains and parcel drones. The journey ends almost directly in front of the check-in machine. This is possible because the luggage was transported separately in advance, which means it takes much less time to get out of the car. As they have some time to spare, the family goes into a fast-food restaurant, places their order at a display terminal, pays and receives an order slip. They can use this to log in at any table they like and the food is automatically delivered to the table. A service robot with a keep-warm function serves them. Although this is less personal than before, it does mean that the food is still piping hot when it arrives at the table. Many restaurant chains now use service robots like this, which enables them to stay open 24  h a day. However, during the flight, a flight attendant is available for the board service, not a robot.|$|R
30|$|A {{family is}} looking forward to their summer holiday in Spain: their {{suitcases}} are packed and the <b>driverless</b> <b>taxi</b> is about to come and collect them. Their luggage is checked in automatically at the airport. The family won’t see their bags again until they get to their hotel room. Before the family leaves their house, they set the home automation controller to holiday mode. The controller switches lights on and off {{to make it look like}} someone’s at home, and even briefly opens windows safely located on the first floor to the tilt position. From the outside, you would hardly know that the house is unoccupied. Actually it’s not really vacant, as the home robot will water the flowers and tell them straight away if anything untoward happens in the house or garden.|$|E
30|$|Two interrelated {{problems}} stand out: first, emerging technologies’ job automation potential; and second, growing {{labor market}} polarization deepening already {{high levels of}} social inequality that have grown continually during {{three and a half}} decades of globalization, market liberalization, and welfare state retrenchment. 10 According to one influential study [33], about 47 % of the workforce in advanced economies are at a “high risk” of technological substitution {{over the course of the}} next two decades. 11 And while in the past the targets for automation were heavily concentrated in the low-skilled segments of the labor market, today sizable fractions of higher level skills and even professional occupations are becoming susceptible too, as general purpose technologies equipped with “synthetic intellect” [42] can perform increasingly complex tasks. Thus, it is estimated that worldwide, up to 100 million knowledge workers [51] in fields as diverse as the law, medicine, the mass media, finance, education, and even science could be replaced by sophisticated computer algorithms that (will soon have the capacity to) outperform humans in a wide range of cognitive tasks long believed to be the latters’ preserve. The innovations on which these advances depend are progressing at an exponential rate, taking even insiders by surprise. For instance, as late as 2004, leading computer specialists thought self-driving cars would not become a reality for decades to come. Yet, just six years later, Google revealed that its autonomous car had been driving successfully for some time, and business reports now suggest such cars could go into mass production as early as 2020. Foreshadowing this development, in August 2016 the first <b>driverless</b> <b>taxis</b> were put on the road in Singapore, and the operators are planning to make the service commercially available by 2018; similar trials have since started elsewhere [87].|$|R
