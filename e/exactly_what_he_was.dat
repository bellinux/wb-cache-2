5|$|Despite his bluster, Kutuzov {{knew from}} dispatches that his army {{had been too}} badly hurt to fight a {{continuing}} action the following day. He knew <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing: by fighting the pitched battle, he could now retreat with the Russian army still intact, lead its recovery, and force the weakened French forces to move even further from their bases of supply. The dénouement became a textbook example of what a hold logistics placed upon an army far from its center of supply. On September8, the Russian army {{moved away from the}} battlefield in twin columns to Semolino, allowing Napoleon to occupy Moscow and await for 5 weeks a Russian surrender that would never come.|$|E
25|$|Jung did {{not plan}} to study {{psychiatry}} since it was not considered prestigious at the time. But, studying a psychiatric textbook, he became very excited when he discovered that psychoses are personality diseases. His interest was immediately captured—it combined the biological and the spiritual, <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> searching for. In 1895 Jung began to study medicine at the University of Basel. Barely a year later in 1896, his father Paul died and left the family near destitute. They were helped out by relatives who also contributed to Jung's studies. During his student days, he entertained his contemporaries with the family legend, that his paternal grandfather was the illegitimate son of Wolfgang Goethe and his German great-grandmother, Sophie Ziegler. In later life, he pulled back from this tale, saying only that Sophie {{was a friend of}} Goethe's niece.|$|E

The song begins with seven distinct synthesizer notes played on the Synclavier digital synthesizer, with Tom Bahler credited for the Synclavier performance on the song. The intro is taken note for note from a demo LP released the year before, called [...] "The Incredible Sounds of Synclavier II" [...] first published in 1981 by Denny Jaeger Creative Services, Inc and sold by New England Digital, makers of the Synclavier.|$|E

500|$|National Book Award finalist Richard Yates told The New York Times in 1977 {{that reading}} Salinger's stories {{for the first}} time was a {{landmark}} experience, and that [...] "nothing quite like it has happened to me since". Yates describes Salinger as [...] "a man who used language as if it were pure energy beautifully controlled, and who knew <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing in every silence as well as in every word." [...] Gordon Lish's O. Henry Award-winning short story [...] "For Jeromé—With Love and Kisses" [...] (1977, collected in What I Know So Far, 1984) is a play on Salinger's [...] "For Esmé—with Love and Squalor".|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Amondson was {{approached}} by Thompson Township, Pennsylvania tax assessor James Hedges, the Prohibition Party's only elected official. He convinced Amondson to seek the nomination of his faction of the Prohibition Party, which split over perennial presidential nominee Earl Dodge's leadership of the party. Hedges' faction felt Dodge was more concerned with his campaign button business than advancing the party's goals. Dodge had run as the party's nominee in every election since 1984, but received only 208 votes in the 2000 election, down approximately 1,000 from the 1996 election. Amondson commenced his first presidential campaign with the nomination of Hedges' faction. Dodge received the other faction's nomination. According to Dodge, Amondson had previously contacted him about the vice presidential nomination, but {{it had already been}} filled. Dodge reasoned Amondson was [...] "probably a very nice man... he may not have known <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> getting into." [...] Conversely, Amondson referred to Dodge as a [...] "good man" [...] with whom he shared the same message, but argued, [...] "Dodge is just not getting the job done. He's too old. We need to send it to an earlier generation." ...|$|E
500|$|Ruth {{had asked}} Yankees general manager Ed Barrow for {{permission}} to barnstorm. Barrow had no objection but warned Ruth he must obtain Landis's consent. [...] Landis biographer Spink, {{who was at the}} time the editor of The Sporting News, stated, [...] "I can say that Ruth knew <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing when he defied Landis in October, 1921. He was willing to back his own popularity and well-known drawing powers against the Judge." [...] Ruth, to the commissioner's irritation, did not contact Landis until October 15, one day before the first exhibition. When the two spoke by telephone, Landis ordered Ruth to attend a meeting with him; Ruth refused, stating that he had to leave for Buffalo for the first game. Landis angrily refused consent for Ruth to barnstorm, and after slamming down the receiver, is recorded as saying, [...] "Who the hell does that big ape think he is? [...] That blankety-blank! [...] If he goes on that trip it {{will be one of the}} sorriest things he has ever done." [...] By one account, Yankees co-owner Colonel Tillinghast Huston attempted to dissuade Ruth as he departed, only to be told by the ballplayer, [...] "Aw, tell the old guy to jump in a lake." ...|$|E
5000|$|Some called Congressman Al Bell a {{political}} conservative, others a moderate. A Ralph Nader study on Bell's voting record in 1972 said: [...] "It's {{hard to say}} <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is.</b> <b>He</b> leans in many areas, especially those concerning economic regulation, toward the conservatives. When {{it comes to the}} people issues, especially those concerning the downtrodden in American society, Bell is a liberal." ...|$|R
50|$|Returning to his crypt, Spike thinks {{back on his}} {{attempted}} rape. He pours {{himself a}} drink, but when memories of the attempted rape haunt him he becomes so upset and furious that he crushes the glass in his hand. Just then Clem comes by, and Spike begins to wonder <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is.</b> <b>He</b> becomes distraught both that he attacked Buffy and that he backed off - something the pre-chip Spike would never have done. He questions whether his feelings for Buffy really <b>are</b> love. <b>He</b> realizes <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not a monster, yet can't be a man. Clem tells him that things change, and Spike suddenly gets an idea, and tells Clem that things do change... if you make them.|$|R

2500|$|Wilder also decked Stanwyck out in {{the blonde}} wig [...] "to {{complement}} her anklet...and to make her look as sleazy as possible." [...] This wig has been cited by some as being the picture's biggest flaw claiming that it looks too “fake”. [...] According to Wilder, this was <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going for when he chose the wig wanting to project, [...] "the phoniness of the girl – Bad taste, phony wig," [...] with cheap perfume to match. Unconvinced, Paramount production head Buddy DeSylva was overheard to say, [...] "We hired Barbara Stanwyck, and here we get George Washington." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Los Angeles Times {{wrote that}} Muncie [...] "was gifted with size, speed and power", while The Miami News said he possessed the {{strength}} of a fullback and the elegance of a halfback. U-T San Diego added that he was [...] "widely considered the most talented running back of his era", and the San Francisco Chronicle said Muncie [...] "could have been the greatest running back in NFL history, a 2.0 version of Jim Brown" [...] if he had the discipline of running backs like Walter Payton or Roger Craig. [...] "His head is the only thing holding him back", said Jim Brown. [...] "If he had total dedication, he could achieve any goal." [...] While he was in New Orleans, he frequently slept through meetings whenever he attended them at all. Whenever the Saints broke the huddle, quarterback Archie Manning had to walk by Muncie and tell him <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> supposed to do in the upcoming play. Manning recalled years later that it was obvious that Muncie [...] "wasn't thinking about football" [...] during the week.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, he was {{involved}} in shows for the BBC and Thames Television (as well as Frankie Howerd Reveals All for Yorkshire Television in 1980). Ray Galton and Alan Simpson wrote for him from 1964 to 1966 when he worked for the BBC and also for a one-off show for Thames, Frankie Howerd meets the Bee Gees, shown on 20 August 1968. He was famous for his seemingly off-the-cuff remarks to the audience, especially in the show Up Pompeii!, which was a direct follow-up from Forum. His television work was characterised by direct addresses to camera and by his littering monologues with verbal tics such as [...] "Oooh, no missus" [...] and [...] "Titter ye not". A later sale of his scripts, however, showed that the seemingly off-the-cuff remarks had all been meticulously planned. Barry Cryer said of his technique: [...] "What he could do with a script was amazing, like all the great performers. He transformed something you'd just written – what you hoped was in a Frankie Howerd idiom – but when you heard him do it, my God, it was something else; – it was gossiping over the garden wall, the apparent waffle – he was like a tightrope walker, you thought he's going to fall off in a minute, you thought , 'Come on, Frank' , we're waiting for a laugh, and then, suddenly, Bang. He knew <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing." [...] Another feature of his humour was to feign innocence about his obvious and [...] double entendres, while mockingly censuring the audience for finding them funny.|$|E
5|$|When a {{musician}} hears Bix's solo on 'Singing the Blues', he becomes aware after two bars that the soloist knows <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> doing {{and that he}} has an exquisite sense of discord and resolution. He knows also that this player is endowed with the rarest jazz gift of all, a sense of form which lends to an improvised performance a coherence which no amount of teaching can produce. The listening musician, whatever his generation or his style, recognizes Bix as a modern, modernism being not a style but an attitude.|$|R
6000|$|Again {{the woman}} {{appeared}} to reflect [...] "Prosperity {{is apt to}} kill romance," [...] she said. [...] "One is never quite content, you know, and I feel now and then that Shafton scarcely understands me. That is a complaint people appear to find ludicrous, of course, though I really don't see why they should do so. Shafton is conventional and precise. You know <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> going to do, {{and that it will}} be right, but one has longings now and then for something original and intense." ...|$|R
60|$|Violet Wayne left him, {{a little}} perplexed, but relieved. As <b>he</b> {{believed}} <b>what</b> {{she had told}} him implicitly, his thoughts fixed themselves upon Tony’s suggestion, and he commenced to sift <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had heard for anything that would confirm the poacher theory. He meant to do his duty as a magistrate, but he had made a fetish of the family honor, and the man who knows <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> looking for has the better chance of finding it. Accordingly he almost convinced himself, and proceeded to another conference with Sergeant Stitt, who was a little more obtuse than superior.|$|R
2500|$|The {{basis of}} [...] "Catherine of Aragon" [...] was {{originally}} {{a piece that}} Wakeman wrote for Fragile with a working title of [...] "Handle With Care". Its title came about as staff at Trident Studios recommended the tape's storage box be labelled something misleading to {{lower the risk of}} theft and the tapes being sold as bootlegs. The box that had the song's tape in had a label that read [...] "Handle with care for the Joe Loss Orchestra", which Wakeman took and adapted for the track's title. [...] "I thought, 'No one is going to nick that!', and they didn't". Recorded at Trident Studios in London, the track features Yes's guitarist Steve Howe and bassist Chris Squire with percussionist Ray Cooper. By the time production began on [...] "Catherine Howard", engineer Ken Scott was replaced by Paul Tregurtha. Strawbs member Chas Cronk, who plays the bass guitar on the track, recalled the [...] "total confusion" [...] during the recording and [...] "couldn't make head or tail of what [...] were doing. We were going through it part by part and I couldn't see how all the parts were going to match up." [...] He noted that Rick [...] "knew <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to do although he had nothing written down. It was all stored in his head." [...] Wakeman describes [...] "Anne of Cleves" [...] as a [...] "rather free-form" [...] track, [...] "almost having no form at all, there was a contradiction in what everyone was playing. The guys in the band thought I was completely barking, but it had to be like that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stephanie Maslansky is {{the costume}} {{designer}} for Iron Fist, after serving {{the same role}} for the previous Marvel Netflix series. Maslansky noted one {{of the differences in}} the series compared to the other Marvel Netflix series was the neighborhoods it spent time in ("the wealthier neighborhoods; Midtown, Upper East Side, that sort of thing") compared to Hell's Kitchen for Daredevil and Jessica Jones and Harlem for Luke Cage. As such, Rand wears more suits than the other heroes, and given the amount of fighting he does in the season, a lot of spandex was added to increase the suits' flexibility. Rand's look evolves throughout the season, with Maslansky noting, [...] "When we first meet him he's clearly traveled a long way. I wanted people to look at Danny and not be sure <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was.</b> A backpacker, or a homeless man. His look needed to reflect a variety of culture... almost ... otherworldly." [...] Once Rand enters the corporate world, he settles on an [...] "Urban Cali" [...] style, which is [...] "a little looser, little more relaxed. But it’s still a suit. His tie is never tied tightly and he always wears sneakers." [...] This relaxed style for Rand also provided [...] "a strong contrast" [...] to Ward Meachum who is a [...] "far more corporate looking person." [...] The monk costumes and Rand's warrior costume was based on [...] "real Shaolin warrior monk costumes... I took that distinctive silhouette from the Shaolin warrior monk clothing, and we combined it with the traditional colors of the Iron Fist, green and gold." [...] Regarding Gao, Maslansky stated [...] "Her particular look is influenced by ancient China," [...] particularly the Terracotta Army and further progress the [...] "villainy" [...] look of the Marvel Netflix series of [...] "surround themselves with , with beautiful things." ...|$|E

6000|$|The deepest and soundest {{philosophers}} {{will tell}} us {{that there must be}} an [...] "I Am."

So that this self-existing Being whom we call God, would <b>be</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> now, if the whole universe, sun, moon, and stars, were destroyed this moment; and would <b>be</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> now, if there had never been any universe at all, or any thing or being except His own perfect and self-existent Self.
