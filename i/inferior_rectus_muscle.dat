5000|$|While {{there have}} been many modifications, Thompson’s {{procedure}} has often been used as a basis. [...] First, the conjunctiva and Tenon's capsule are incised about 6 mm from the corneal limbus. The lateral, superior, and <b>inferior</b> <b>recti</b> <b>muscles</b> are separated using a strabismus hook. The connecting tissue is then separated from the posterior pole, as well as the inferior oblique muscle. The strip of material is passed under the separated muscles, and pushed down deeply towards the posterior pole. Both ends of the material strip are crossed over the medial <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> and sutured to the sclera on the medial side of the superior and <b>inferior</b> <b>recti</b> <b>muscles.</b> The conjunctiva and Tenon's capsule are then closed together.|$|R

Although volumes of the superior rectus muscle-levator complex and superior oblique were significantly reduced.|$|R
50|$|Three {{antagonistic}} {{pairs of}} muscles control eye movements: the lateral and medial <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles,</b> the superior and <b>inferior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles,</b> and the superior and inferior oblique muscles. These muscles {{are responsible for}} movements of the eye along three different axes: horizontal, either toward the nose (adduction) or away from the nose (abduction); vertical, either elevation or depression; and torsional, movements that bring {{the top of the}} eye toward the nose (intorsion) or away from the nose (extorsion). Horizontal movements are controlled entirely by the medial and lateral rectus muscles; the medial <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> is responsible for adduction, the lateral <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> for abduction. Vertical movements require the coordinated action of the superior and <b>inferior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles,</b> as well as the oblique muscles. The relative contribution of the rectus and oblique groups depends on the horizontal position of the eye. In the primary position (eyes straight ahead), both of these groups contribute to vertical movements. Elevation is due to the action of the superior <b>rectus</b> and <b>inferior</b> oblique <b>muscles,</b> while depression is due to the action of the <b>inferior</b> <b>rectus</b> and superior oblique muscles. When the eye is abducted, the <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles</b> are the prime vertical movers. Elevation is due to the action of the superior rectus, and depression is due to the action of the <b>inferior</b> <b>rectus.</b> When the eye is adducted, the oblique muscles are the prime vertical movers. Elevation is due to the action of the inferior oblique muscle, while depression is due to the action of the superior oblique muscle. The oblique muscles are also primarily responsible for torsional movements.|$|R
50|$|Individuals {{can suffer}} from several tropias at once. In Graves ophthalmopathy, {{it is not}} {{uncommon}} to see an esotropia (due to pathology of the medial rectus muscle) co-morbid with a hypotropia (due to pathology of the <b>inferior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle).</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{inferior}} ophthalmic vein {{begins in}} a venous network at the forepart {{of the floor}} and medial wall of the orbit; it receives some vorticose veins and other veins from the <b>inferior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle,</b> inferior oblique muscle, lacrimal sac and eyelids, runs backward in {{the lower part of}} the orbit lying above the inferior rectus and divides into two branches.|$|E
50|$|Plain radiographs, on {{the other}} hand, do not sensitively capture blowout fractures. On Water's view radiograph, polypoid mass can be {{observed}} hanging from the floor into the maxillary antrum, classically known as teardrop sign, as it usually is in shape of a teardrop. This polypoid mass consists of herniated orbital contents, periorbital fat and <b>inferior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle.</b> The affected sinus is partially opacified on radiograph. Air-fluid level in maxillary sinus may sometimes be seen due to presence of blood. Lucency in orbits (on a radiograph) usually indicate orbital emphysema.|$|E
2500|$|Nerves {{and muscles}} may be trapped by broken bones; {{in these cases}} the bones need to be put back into their proper places quickly. [...] For example, {{fractures}} of the orbital floor or medial orbital wall of the eye can entrap the medial <b>rectus</b> or <b>inferior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles.</b> [...] In facial wounds, tear ducts and nerves of the face may be damaged. [...] Fractures of the frontal bone can interfere with the drainage of the frontal sinus and can cause sinusitis.|$|R
50|$|Four of the extraocular muscles {{have their}} {{origin in the}} back of the orbit in a fibrous ring called the annulus of Zinn: the four <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles.</b> The four <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles</b> attach {{directly}} to the front half of the eye (anterior to the eye's equator), and are named after their straight paths. Note that medial and lateral are relative terms. Medial indicates near the midline, and lateral describes a position away from the midline. Thus, the medial <b>rectus</b> is the <b>muscle</b> closest to the nose. The superior and <b>inferior</b> <b>recti</b> do not pull straight back on the eye, because both muscles also pull slightly medially. This posterior medial angle causes the eye to roll with contraction of either the superior <b>rectus</b> or <b>inferior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles.</b> The extent of rolling in the recti is less than the oblique, and opposite from it.|$|R

The cyclopic material consists of a full term desiccated head, a dried fetal skull and four sectioned fetal heads. Most elements in the floor of the median orbit are normal. Such abnormalities as are present in the bony floor and the related lacrimal sac are considered to be secondary to the absence of the presphenoid and the postero-inferior part of the nasal cavity.

50|$|In {{moderate}} active disease, {{the signs}} and symptoms are persistent and increasing and include myopathy. The inflammation and edema of the extraocular muscles lead to gaze abnormalities. The <b>inferior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> is the most commonly affected muscle and patient may experience vertical diplopia on upgaze and limitation of elevation of the eyes due to fibrosis of the muscle. This may also increase the intraocular pressure of the eyes. The double vision is initially intermittent but can gradually become chronic. The medial rectus is the second-most-commonly-affected muscle, but multiple muscles may be affected, in an asymmetric fashion.|$|E
50|$|Each {{anterior}} semi-circular canals has excitatory projections to the ipsilateral superior {{rectus muscle}} and its yoke i.e., the contralateral inferior oblique while simultaneously inhibiting the ipsilateral <b>inferior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> and its yoke i.e. the contralateral superior oblique. Also, each posterior semi-circular canals has excitatory projections to the ipsilateral superior oblique and its yoke i.e. the contralateral inferior rectus, while simultaneously inhibiting the ipsilateral inferior oblique and its yoke i.e. the contralateral superior rectus. A head tilt causes stimulation of both anterior semi-circular canals and the posterior semi-circular canals resulting in excitation of ipsilateral intorters (superior oblique and superior rectus) and contralateral extorters (inferior oblique and inferior rectus) while their antagonists are simultaneously inhibited. The otoliths (utricle and saccule) probably follow a similar pathway.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a {{qualitative and quantitative}} investigation into {{the location of the}} motoneurons innervating the extra-ocular muscles of the rat. Injections of horseradish peroxidase, bisbenzimide, propidium iodide and DAPI-primuline were made either in one or simultaneously in two muscles. Unlike those of the cat, rabbit and monkey, the motoneurons which make up the oculomotor nucleus of the rat are not arranged in spatially separate subgroups belonging each to its corresponding extra-ocular muscle, but instead allow a high degree of superposition among the motor pools which they compose. The motoneurons innervating the lateral <b>rectus</b> and <b>inferior</b> oblique <b>muscles</b> are all homolateral; those of the medial and <b>inferior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles</b> are mainly homolateral with a few contralateral exceptions; and those of the superior rectus, levator palpebrae and superior oblique muscles are mainly contralateral with a small minority of homolateral exceptions. As well as from the main motor pools with which they are associated, the medial <b>rectus,</b> <b>inferior</b> <b>rectus,</b> superior rectus, levator palpebrae, superior oblique and lateral <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles</b> all receive innervation from motoneurons lying among the fibres of the fasciculus longitudinalis medialis.

50|$|The great {{importance}} of intorsion and extorsion {{produced by the}} two oblique muscles can only be understood when it is considered {{with regards to the}} other muscle actions present. The two obliques prevent the eye from rotating about its long axis (retina to pupil) when the superior and <b>inferior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles</b> contract. This is because the orbit does not face directly forwards- the centre-line of the orbit is a little over 20 degrees out from the mid-line. But because the eyes do face forwards, when acting alone, as well as making the eye look up, superior rectus causes it to rotate slightly about the long axis, so the top of the eye moves medially (intorsion). Similarly, in addition to making the eye look down, <b>inferior</b> <b>rectus</b> would cause the eye to rotate about the long axis so the top of the eye moves slightly laterally (extorsion), if acting alone. Clearly this is undesirable as our vision would rotate when we looked up and down. For this reason, these two <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles</b> work in conjunction with the two obliques. When acting alone, superior oblique causes intorsion, inferior oblique, extorsion. Hence, when <b>inferior</b> <b>rectus</b> contracts so we look down, superior oblique also contracts to prevent extorsion of the eye, and when superior rectus contracts so we look up, inferior oblique contracts to prevent intorsion, thus the undesired rotatory actions of the <b>inferior</b> and superior <b>recti</b> about the long axis of the eye are cancelled out. This keeps our vision horizontally level, irrespective of eye position in the orbit.|$|R
40|$|Herein, {{we report}} {{the case of}} a patient who {{developed}} unilateral blindness secondary to traumatic optic neuropathy and central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) after endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS). Visual acuity was no light perception in the right eye and 1. 0 in the left eye. Antrerior segment was normal in both eyes. Fundoscopy revealed pallor white coloration of the macula with indistinct margins of the optic disc in the right eye and normal in the left eye. Fundus fluorescein angiography demonstrated CRAO. Fracture lines of the orbital wall {{at the level of the}} anterior ethmoidal cells and pronounced deviated nasal septum were detected on computed tomography. Herniation of the medial and <b>inferior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles</b> with extraconal fat tissue was observed. In addition to the findings on computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging of the orbita showed signal changes in the optic nerve and retrobulbar edema indicating traumatic optic neuropathy. In order to prevent severe vision loss, the surgeon should repair deviated nasal septum before the ESS and must pay serious attention during the operation.

50|$|The {{depressing}} {{action of}} superior oblique (making the eye look down towards the mouth) {{is most effective}} when the eye is in an adducted position. This is because as the eye is abducted (looks laterally), the contribution made by superior oblique to depression of the eye decreases, as the <b>inferior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> causes this movement more directly and powerfully. The main muscle for abduction is the lateral rectus, so although superior oblique contributes to a downwards and lateral eye movement, testing this motion would not be specific enough as inferior and lateral recti muscles would also be tested. Therefore, during neurological examinations, the superior oblique is tested by having the patient look inwards and downwards, testing only the depressing action of the muscle. This {{is a source of}} confusion on the subject as although clinical testing asks the patient to adduct and depress the eye, anatomically the muscle depresses and abducts it.|$|E
40|$|To {{examine the}} {{characteristics}} of excyclotropia correction through surgery on the <b>inferior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> in patients with thyroid eye disease. This was a retrospective, observational study at a single institution. We reviewed 36 patients who had undergone unilateral <b>inferior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> recession, with or without nasal <b>inferior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> transposition. The following factors were investigated as possibly influencing excyclotropia correction: <b>inferior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> thickness, degree of adipose change in the <b>inferior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle,</b> smoking status, history of orbital radiotherapy, {{and the amount of}} <b>inferior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> recession. Using T 1 -weighted coronal magnetic resonance imaging, we measured the cross-sectional area of the <b>inferior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> at its largest point, as well as the bright-signal area of the <b>inferior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle,</b> which reflects intermuscular adipose change. We then calculated the percentage internal bright-signal area at the point of the largest <b>inferior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> cross-sectional area. The history of orbital radiotherapy was graded using a binary system. We evaluated correlations among excyclotropia correction, the amount of nasal <b>inferior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> transposition, and the possible influencing factors listed, using stepwise multiple regression analyses. The multiple regression model demonstrated a significant relationship among excyclotropia correction, amount of nasal <b>inferior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> transposition, and the amount of <b>inferior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> recession (YCORRECTION = 8. 546 XTENDON WIDTH + 0. 405 XRECESSION- 0. 908; r = 0. 844; adjusted r 2 = 0. 695; P < 0. 001). Excyclotropia correction was correlated with the amount of nasal <b>inferior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> transposition and the amount of <b>inferior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> recession, but not with the other factors. The regression model presented in this study will enable us to determine more precisely the amount of nasal <b>inferior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> transposition in patients with excyclotropia of various angles...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{report a}} case of <b>inferior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> {{hypoplasia}} with esotropia, which was treated successfully by resection and anterior transposition of the inferior oblique muscle. Observations: A 1 -year-old boy presented with esotropia. He had esotropia of 15 – 30 ° and intermittent left hypertropia. At the age of 3 years, the alternate prism cover test showed esotropia of 35 Δ and left hypertropia of 25 Δ. Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbit revealed left <b>inferior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> dysgenesis. Strabismus surgery was performed and a hypoplastic left <b>inferior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> was identified. We performed bilateral medial rectus muscle recession, and resection and anterior transposition of the left inferior oblique muscle. Nine months after the surgery, the patient had esotropia of 8 Δ and left hypertropia of 6 Δ.

40|$|Objective To {{demonstrate}} {{feasibility of}} near-real-time oculodynamic {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (od-MRI) in depicting extraocular muscles and correlate quantitatively the motion degree in comparison with clinical testing in patients with diplopia. Methods In 30 od-MRIs eye movements were tracked in the horizontal and sagittal plane using a a TrueFISP sequence with high temporal resolution. Three physicians graded the visibility of extraocular muscles by a qualitative scale. In 12 cases, the maximal monocular excursions in the horizontal and vertical direction of both eyes were measured in od-MRIs and a clinical test and correlated by the Pearson test. Results The medial and lateral <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles</b> were visible in the axial plane in 93 of the cases. The oblique, superior and <b>inferior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles</b> were overall only in 14 visible. Horizontal (p[*]=[*] 0, 015) and vertical (p[*]=[*] 0, 029) movements of the right eye and vertical movement of the left eye (p[*]=[*] 0, 026) measured by od-MRI correlated positively to the clinical measurements. Conclusions Od-MRI is a feasible technique. Visualization of the horizontal/vertical <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles</b> is better than for the superior/inferior oblique muscle. Od-MRI correlates well with clinical testing and may reproduce the extent of eye bulb motility and extraocular muscle structural or functional deteriorations.

50|$|Six extraocular muscles {{facilitate}} eye movement. These muscles {{arise from}} the common tendinous ring in the orbit, the eye cavity, and attach to the eyeball. The six muscles are the lateral, medial, <b>inferior</b> and superior <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles,</b> and the <b>inferior</b> and superior oblique muscles. The muscles, when contracting, cause movement of the eyeball, by pulling the eyeball towards the muscle. For example, the lateral rectus is on the lateral side of the eyeball. When it contracts, the eyeball moves so that the pupil looks outwards. The medial rectus causes the eyeball to look inwards; the <b>inferior</b> <b>rectus</b> downwards and the superior rectus upwards. The superior oblique muscle and inferior oblique muscle attach at angles to the eyeball.|$|R
40|$|A 46 -year-old male {{patient was}} {{referred}} to our clinic with complaints of diplopia and esotropia in his right eye that developed after a car accident. The patient had right esotropia in primary position and abduction of the right eye was totally limited. Primary deviation was over 40 prism diopters at near and distance. The patient was diagnosed with sixth nerve palsy and 18 months after trauma, he underwent right medial <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> recession. Ten months after the first operation, full-thickness tendon transposition of the superior and <b>inferior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles</b> (with Foster suture) was performed. On the first postoperative day, slit-lamp examination revealed corneal edema, 3 + cells in the anterior chamber and an irregular pupil. According to these findings, the diagnosis was anterior segment ischemia. Treatment with 0. 1 / 5 mL topical dexamethasone drops (16 times/day), cyclopentolate hydrochloride drops (3 times/day) and 20 mg oral fluocortolone (3 times/day) was initiated. After 1 week of treatment, corneal edema regressed and the anterior chamber was clean. Topical and systemic steroid treatment was gradually discontinued. At postoperative 1 month, the patient was orthophoric {{and there were no}} pathologic symptoms besides the irregular pupil. Anterior segment ischemia {{is one of the most}} serious complications of strabismus surgery. Despite the fact that in most cases the only remaining sequel is an irregular pupil, serious circulation deficits could lead to phthisis bulbi.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} bilateral <b>inferior</b> <b>rectus</b> recession regarding improvement of elevation, reduction of abnormal head tilt and vertical squint angle in patients with Graves orbitopathy. Method: Retrospective case series. Patients with Graves orbitopathy who underwent symmetric or asymmetric bilateral <b>inferior</b> <b>rectus</b> recession were selected for this study. Effect on change of elevation, depression cyclodeviation, and vertical squint angle was calculated 3 months and 6 to 12 months postoperatively. Results: Forty-three patients could be included, who underwent a recession of both <b>inferior</b> <b>recti</b> by 1 of the 5 surgeons. Three months postoperatively, the elevation changed from 12 degrees +/- 6. 9 degrees preoperatively to 19 degrees +/- 6. 7 degrees postoperatively (p = 0. 000) and the depression from 54 degrees +/- 6. 2 degrees preoperatively to 48 degrees +/- 9. 2 degrees postoperatively (p = 0. 005). Total duction range remained stable (p = 0. 728). Three months after surgery, motility did not change significantly anymore. The dose effect response on elevation was 1. 7 degrees +/- 1. 7 degrees/mm, and was higher in case of severe preoperative elevation restriction (r = - 0. 405). Three months postoperatively, the excyclodeviation changed from 6. 4 degrees +/- 6. 0 degrees to 0. 4 degrees +/- 6. 0 degrees in primary position (p = 0. 000). However, in downgaze 4 patients developed a significant incyclodeviation of > 5 degrees. Muscle volume, prior decompression surgery, or performing surgeon did not influence the outcome. Conclusion: Bilateral recession of the <b>inferior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles</b> in patients with Graves orbitopathy results in a shift of vertical duction range toward upgaze and a significant decrease of excyclodeviation. Overcorrection of cyclodeviation in downgaze has to be considered before planning this type of surgery. Poor preoperative elevation contributes to higher dose-effect responses. Considering all variables, the orthoptic picture does not change after 3 months of surgery. (Ophthal Plast Reconstr Surg 2012; 28 : 268 - 272...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} bioadhesive in attaching the extraocular muscles to porous polyethylene spheres in rabbit enucleated cavities. METHODS: A prospective, experimental study was performed. Eight adult New Zealand white rabbits underwent right enucleation with insertion of an unwrapped 12 mm porous polyethylene sphere. The superior and <b>inferior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles</b> were attached to the implant with 2 -octyl cyanoacrylate placed to {{the underside of the}} muscles and application of pressure for 5 seconds. Ninety days after surgery, the orbits were exenterated and four animals underwent histologic evaluation and the other four animals tensile strength testing of the muscle-sphere attachment. RESULTS: There were no exposures or infections of the implants and the muscles remained attached in all cases. Histologic examination showed fibrous tissue reaction at the muscle-sphere attachment with minimal inflammation of the surrounding tissues; a pseudocapsule formation around the spheres and full vascularization of the implant was also observed. There was no evidence of residual glue on histologic examination. Tensile strength testing showed that rupture force was similar between bonded muscle and the porous polyethylene sphere. CONCLUSIONS: The 2 -octyl-cyanoacrylate did not cause deleterious effects in orbital tissues and provided strong adhesion between muscles and spheres. Bioadhesive may be an option for attaching the extraocular muscles to orbital implants in anophthalmic cavity reconstruction. Lucieni Cristina Barbarini Ferraz, Silvana A. A. Schellini, Sheila L. L.

30|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to find {{clinical}} factors which give prediction for either a single surgery or two or more surgeries, required to treat successfully the idiopathic and acquired superior oblique muscle palsy. In the study period of 8  years, baseline surgical strategy for the idiopathic and acquired superior oblique muscle palsy at our institution was to plan a second surgery when the initial surgery was insufficient to treat diplopia or abnormal head posture. Basic surgical procedures, adopted as an initial surgery in this strategy, were inferior oblique muscle recession on the paretic side or <b>inferior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> recession on the non-paretic side. The inferior oblique muscle recession on the paretic side was chosen basically when the non-paretic eye was the dominant eye, used for fixation. The <b>inferior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> recession on the non-paretic side was chosen when the paretic eye was the dominant eye for fixation. A single surgical procedure was taken at a single secession of the surgery in most patients while two surgical procedures were done at a single secession only in the limited number of patients.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Clinical data {{indicate}} that extraocular muscles have different susceptibilities for some orbital immune disorders depending on their anatomic location. The resident immunocompetent cells may be important mediators in the local pathogenesis of such disorders so the distribution of these cells was studied in extraocular muscles obtained from normal human donors. For comparison skeletal muscles were studied. METHODS: The cell distributions were analyzed quantitatively in cryostat cross-sections subjected to a two-step immunoperoxidase method using monoclonal antibodies against T cells, B cells, macrophages and several other markers for cell differentiation or activation. The macrophage distribution was analyzed in more detail using on-line semiautomatic image analysis equipment (VIDAS, Kontron, Elektronik GmbH, Eching, Germany). RESULTS: Extraocular muscles contain numerous macrophages, fewer human leukocyte antigenD-related (HLA-DR) positive cells and T cells, whereas B cells are absent. The numeric density of all cell types, and macrophages in particular, is much higher in extraocular muscles than in skeletal muscles. In extraocular muscles the majority of T cells are positive for the CD 8 antigen (suppressor/cytotoxic), in skeletal muscle CD 4 positive T cells (helper) predominate. CONCLUSIONS: Extraocular muscles contain many more CD 8 -positive cells and macrophages per square millimeter than skeletal muscles. Of all the cell types studied, only the macrophage distribution differs significantly among the normal extraocular muscles: the medial and <b>inferior</b> <b>recti</b> <b>muscles</b> contain about twice as many macrophages as the lateral rectus and superior oblique muscles.
