2500|$|In {{addition}} to the wheelbase increase (47mm), overall length has increased by [...] and track [...] by [...] The bodywork and aerodynamics have been altered to offer maximum down-force, featuring a longer <b>front</b> <b>bonnet</b> with flaps, a closed underbody and a new rear overhang with adjustable rear wing and race-derived diffuser. These are intended to translate into increased aerodynamic efficiency and down-force for maximum cornering speed. It is {{also noted that the}} car's new rear bodywork is minimal in the extreme, being composed mostly of vent. This is thought to be symptomatic of the need to keep the engine cool enough, even under hard track use. Again, this is similar to the gutted bodywork of the Ferrari FXX Evoluzione.|$|E
50|$|The {{very strong}} steel {{spaceframe}} chassis {{was covered by}} a non stressed fiberglass body with the flip <b>front</b> <b>bonnet</b> giving excellent access to the engine bay.|$|E
50|$|Exclusive to Europe, Japan, Australia and New Zealand was {{a limited}} edition Passat R36, which {{featured}} a 3.6-litre V6 engine. This {{version of the}} Passat put out 300 hp, and featured dual exhaust tips, an aggressive <b>front</b> <b>bonnet,</b> and All Wheel Drive.|$|E
50|$|Alcatrazz, also <b>fronted</b> by Graham <b>Bonnet,</b> {{covered the}} song on their album Live Sentence with Yngwie Malmsteen on guitar, {{and yet another}} <b>Bonnet</b> <b>fronted</b> outfit, Impellitteri, {{recorded}} it for their 1988 debut album Stand in Line.|$|R
5000|$|Although the R33/36 World's Fair {{cars were}} later {{referred}} to as Redbirds, the cars were originally painted in a light turquoise blue and white upon delivery. This [...] "Bluebird" [...] paint color scheme was used until the mid-1970s when they were painted in the silver/blue MTA livery. Then they were painted a full white (roof, bonnets, sides were all painted white) from 1981 to 1982 to combat graffiti; since the white paint was a Teflon-based paint, the graffiti did not stick to it very well. The look was abandoned for the famous Redbird style. The Redbirds were painted between 1984 and 1989 to a deep maroon red body, black <b>front</b> <b>bonnets</b> and anti-climbers, and a silver roof.|$|R
25|$|The updated P601 was {{introduced}} in 1964. It was essentially a facelift of the P60, with a different <b>front</b> fascia, <b>bonnet,</b> roof and rear and the original P50 underpinnings. The model remained nearly unchanged {{until the end of}} its production except for the addition of 12V electricity, rear coil springs and an updated dashboard for later models.|$|R
50|$|The {{bodywork}} {{itself was}} built {{in a manner similar}} to the aeroplane design of the era - from plywood; only the <b>front</b> <b>bonnet</b> was made from aluminium plate. This made the body weigh only around 25 kg, while the whole car weighed 560 kg.|$|E
5000|$|The Velo Rossa {{differs from}} {{previous}} designs {{by offering a}} one-piece, tilt-up <b>front</b> <b>bonnet,</b> with [...] "cheek panels" [...] on the sides; {{and the ability to}} be built as either a coupe; or as a Velo Rossa Spyder roadster with a trunk and trunk lid.|$|E
5000|$|The car had a {{combined}} body and chassis {{made of steel}} and plywood and could seat two. The <b>front</b> <b>bonnet</b> could be removed to reveal a luggage compartment. An unusual feature {{was the lack of}} any suspension, the only springing was provided by inflating the tyres to only [...]|$|E
50|$|It did offer a {{combination}} of features which were advanced in this category in Australia at the time: rack and pinion steering, power-assisted disc brakes, MacPherson strut front suspension, <b>front</b> hinged <b>bonnet,</b> glued-in windscreen and concealed windscreen wipers, {{as well as the}} familiar Australian-made Borg Warner gearboxes (including 3 speed column shift) and a live rear axle.|$|R
5000|$|The pre-First World War {{cars had}} a {{distinctive}} front shape caused by positioning the radiator behind {{the engine to}} give a so-called [...] "coalscuttle" [...] bonnet. This continued through the 1920s. Only in 1930 did all models place the radiator at the <b>front.</b> The <b>bonnet</b> badge changed from circular to the familiar and continuing diamond shape in 1925.|$|R
60|$|But in {{an instant}} the <b>front</b> of the <b>bonnet</b> was raised toward Ralph, and upon the young face under it {{there was not a}} shadow of dissatisfaction.|$|R
50|$|Karmann {{was asked}} to build a four-seater, another coach-builder, Hebmüller, {{was asked to}} make a {{two-seater}} roadster. Its design was not unlike the 'Radclyffe Roadster', with a similar hood and side windows. The rear engine cover, however, was a hand-formed panel, not a converted <b>front</b> <b>bonnet</b> as was the Radclyffe version.|$|E
5000|$|The new C3 {{builds on}} the curvy profile of the {{previous}} model and has a look in keeping with other Citroën models and the older C3, although it is longer and wider than the old model. The lights at the <b>front,</b> <b>bonnet,</b> dashboard assembly and other components are shared with the DS3.|$|E
50|$|A sloping <b>front</b> <b>bonnet</b> and a {{contemporary}} sharp-edged, no-frills style {{was brought in}} during May 1983. The new 1839 cc 1C diesel engine {{was added to the}} range with the E80 Series. From 1985, re-badged E80 Sprinters were sold in the U.S. as the fifth-generation Chevrolet Nova. Fuel injection was introduced as an extra cost option internationally.|$|E
50|$|The Boxster was {{released}} {{ahead of its}} big brother, the 996. The 986 Boxster had the same <b>bonnet,</b> <b>front</b> wings, headlights, interior and engine architecture as the 996.|$|R
50|$|The Morris Isis Series II {{was based}} on the Morris Oxford series III body but with longer {{wheelbase}} and <b>front</b> wings and <b>bonnet</b> to accommodate the 6-cylinder engine.|$|R
50|$|Early 18th century bonnets {{tend to be}} plain but {{the second}} half of the century saw the {{introduction}} of a band of lace extending from centre <b>front</b> of <b>bonnet</b> to the nape of the neck, sometimes with a circle in the back. This band was later accompanied by parallel line of pulled-thread embroidery while in early 19th century the circular cap back reappeared.|$|R
50|$|On August 22, 2008, {{an updated}} Perodua Myvi was launched. The new Myvi {{features}} a modified front grille, front bumper, <b>front</b> <b>bonnet,</b> rear bumper, alloy rims, dashboard color, instrument panel design, MP3/WMA player and seat fabric. Its 1.3 Premium model additionally features new UV protection glass, a seat height adjuster, {{as well as}} a new audio system with USB and Bluetooth capabilities.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} of the Mk II echoes {{the style of the}} earlier model, but is in fact a complete redesign. The boot of the new car has an additional 10 L of load space. Other changes in design - both visible and otherwise - have contributed to the Mini's recently awarded five stars in the Euro NCAP tests. One example is the higher <b>front</b> <b>bonnet,</b> which now complies with the European pedestrian collision regulations.|$|E
50|$|Colour {{choice was}} limited to two shades: {{metallic}} light blue or gold. The two-litre cars were also distinguished by a black tape stripe running just below the mid-body character line, matte black bumpers {{in place of the}} usual chrome and the absence of the front spoiler, available as an optional. The SS's <b>front</b> <b>bonnet</b> with the grille between the headlights was used on 2000 GTs. When production ended in 1983 just 200 Meraks 2000 GT had been made.|$|E
50|$|The updated P601 was {{introduced}} in 1964. This car was essentially a facelift of the P60, with a different <b>front</b> fascia, <b>bonnet,</b> roof, and rear, whilst retaining the original P50 underpinnings.This model stayed practically unchanged up to its production end, with the most major changes being 12v electrics, coil springs for the rear, and a different dash for the latest models.|$|R
50|$|The {{spare wheel}} was stored under the <b>front</b> hood / <b>bonnet</b> which left more space for luggage {{at the back}} and {{makes the point that}} the engine was a {{relatively}} compact one.|$|R
5000|$|The Sylva Leader was an {{evolution}} of the Sylva Star retaining the two seater, open top, layout but with improved design features. The two piece fiberglass body consisted of a <b>front</b> hinging <b>bonnet</b> (hood) and low sided passenger compartment. Engine options were Ford Kent Crossflow and Fiat Twin cam engines. Some Sylva Star owners replaced the front with the narrower and more curved Leader front body piece.|$|R
5000|$|Fiat-Abarth OT 2000 Coupe America: {{introduced}} in February 1966, {{it was based}} on the 850 Coupé but powered by a two-litre engine. It differed visually from the 850 Coupé in having a barred grill between the headlights, a split front bumper flanking a spare wheel which projected forward below the grille, widened front and rear tracks and wings, and a vented <b>front</b> <b>bonnet.</b> The 1,946 cc twin cam four-cylinder produced [...] and could propel the car to 240 km/h. Three examples were produced.|$|E
50|$|It is {{a limited}} (20 units) version of the 458 Italia for the Chinese market, commemorating the 20th anniversary of Ferrari in China since the first Ferrari, a 348 TS, was ordered in Beijing. It is {{distinguished}} by its Marco Polo Red body colour, golden dragon graphic on the <b>front</b> <b>bonnet,</b> gold and black livery stripes symbolising a racing track, gold painted wheels, gold aeroelastic winglets, gold embroidery on the car's head rests, engine start button inscribed with the simplified Chinese characters for 'start' and a '20th Anniversary Special Edition' plaque on the dash.|$|E
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to Autobianchi Bianchina, both Weinsberg versions were built from partially assembled car bodies with modifications to both {{front and rear}} panels.The <b>front</b> <b>bonnet</b> is higher, as is the wing profile, with finned rear wings and with rear lights that are unique to the Weinsberg. The cars benefited from some equipment upgrades in character with a luxury version: a sunroof instead of a folding roof, bug ornament, special bumpers, standard two-tone color and wheel covers, ashtray in the dashboard, better upholstery fabrics and wide pockets in the doors.|$|E
25|$|The Ford Escort was revised in January 1995, {{although}} it was still based on the previous model. This version had new <b>front</b> lights, <b>bonnet,</b> <b>front</b> wings, front and rear bumpers, wing mirrors, door handles and 4 different front radiator grilles (slats, honeycomb, circles and chrome). At the rear, the Ford logo moved from the right to {{the centre of the}} boot, except for the van and convertible models. The interior of the car was hugely revised too following heavy criticism of the original 1990 car which featured low quality plastics for its interior mouldings - the car now featured an all new dashboard arrangement of competitive quality. However, the underlying car was now five years old and most of its rivals were either new or to be imminently replaced.|$|R
5000|$|Fiat Automóveis {{introduced}} a facelifted Stilo in late January 2008, {{in which the}} Dualogic manual robotized gearbox was released, being available to every version with the 1.8 8v Flex engine, which now produces [...] (petrol) or [...] when using ethanol as fuel. The car also got minor cosmetic changes to <b>front</b> grille, <b>bonnet,</b> side bumpers and to the taillights, in order to end its production cycle, {{which is expected to}} happen in 2010.|$|R
5000|$|In 1905, the car {{became much}} more conventional, the engine had become a [...] {{water-cooled}} in-line twin and {{was moved to the}} <b>front</b> under the <b>bonnet</b> with the radiator on the scuttle behind the engine, a four-speed gearbox, and shaft drive.|$|R
5000|$|The Noble is a {{front wheel}} drive car with the engine housed under the <b>front</b> <b>bonnet.</b> The engine itself is a 1.1 liter [...] 16v DOHC version of the Suzuki Wagon-R engine with a power output rated at [...] at 6.000 rpm and 88 Nm of torque at 4500 rpm. With the 5-speed manual {{transmission}} the Noble sprints from 0-100 km/h in 17.1s and reaches {{a top speed of}} 138 km/h. The engine is reported to be quite frugal using only 4.5 L/100 km. A five speed manual gearbox is offered in both standard and automated versions.|$|E
50|$|The {{front of}} the car had {{basically}} a rectangular cross section and was rounded {{all the way to the}} floor. The front bumper covered the rounded fenders, while the lower half of the lights was embedded in the <b>front</b> <b>bonnet.</b> The rear of the car had a continuous dropping form, and was divided by a vertical fin, which started at the rear end of the roof and ended almost at the rear end of the car. The rear wheels had aerodynamic covers. The door handles were embedded into the door panels, from which only the door hinges protruded slightly. The car had no rear window, limiting rear visibility to what could be discerned through slots on the sheet metal.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the wheelbase increase (47 mm), overall length has increased by 394 mm and track by 50 mm. The bodywork and aerodynamics have been altered to offer maximum down-force, featuring a longer <b>front</b> <b>bonnet</b> with flaps, a closed underbody and a new rear overhang with adjustable rear wing and race-derived diffuser. These are intended to translate into increased aerodynamic efficiency and down-force for maximum cornering speed. It is {{also noted that the}} car's new rear bodywork is minimal in the extreme, being composed mostly of vent. This is thought to be symptomatic of the need to keep the engine cool enough, even under hard track use. Again, this is similar to the gutted bodywork of the Ferrari FXX Evoluzione.|$|E
50|$|Rover's {{description}} of items {{included with the}} purchase of a chassis for bespoke bodywork: chassis complete with lighting and starting equipment, horn, speedometer, clock, <b>bonnet,</b> <b>front</b> wings, step boards, luggage grid, number plates, shock absorbers, wire wheels, spare wheel and tire, tool kit.|$|R
50|$|When bought as {{a chassis}} for a bespoke body the chassis package {{includes}} lighting and starting sets, twin electric windscreen wipers, all instrument panel fittings, <b>bonnet,</b> <b>front</b> wings and running boards, battery, twin horns, front bumper, all tyres, foot pump and tool kit.|$|R
50|$|The 8/30 and 8/36 lawn {{tractors}} {{were sold}} with an option of a powered grass collector, while the 12/36 was only sold with a powered grass collector. The Atco 6/30 was an economy model with pull start, no electrical equipment, {{and a solid}} mild steel <b>bonnet</b> <b>front.</b>|$|R
