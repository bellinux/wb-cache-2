Much {{of the water in}} this aquifer <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> many thousands of years, since the Pleistocene ice ages, when the climate was cooler and wetter. Today's drier climate does not provide enough precipitation to recharge the aquifer at the rate at which water is being withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|Set in 1957, Great Moments in Aviation follows Gabriel Angel (Rakie Ayola), a young Caribbean {{woman from}} Grenada who embarks {{on a cruise}} to England with the {{intention}} of becoming an aviator. Upon boarding the ship, Gabriel finds herself assigned shared sleeping quarters with fellow passenger Duncan Stewart (Jonathan Pryce). The rest of the ship's passengers, including missionaries Angela Bead (Vanessa Redgrave) and Gwendolyne Quim (Dorothy Tutin) assume the two are married, and when Professor Rex Goodyear (John Hurt) appears to recognise Duncan as his old acquaintance Alasdair Birch, Duncan fosters the assumption to maintain his cover. It transpires that Duncan is a forger, who many years ago stole a Titian painting from Goodyear and had an affair with his wife. Goodyear believes that his painting is on board the ship, and leads Gabriel to believe that Duncan was responsible for his wife's death. She is furious with Duncan for lying to her, but the two go on to reconcile and later make love. Their romance is complicated by the fact Gabriel professes to have a husband waiting for her in England. She explains that he <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> two years working, and she is joining him so that she can fulfil her lifelong dream of becoming a pilot — inspired by her grandfather Thomas (Oliver Samuels) who flew off into a storm and never came home. They begin a relationship nonetheless, supported by Angela and Gwendolyne, who also come to realise that they have feelings for one another. They each confess to having secretly been in love with the other for years, and become lovers, vowing to live together in their retirement. It comes to light that the death of Goodyear's wife was an accident, caused as he and Duncan fought over her. Duncan returns his painting, and goes on to burn all his forged documents and papers in front of Gabriel. She confesses that her marriage to Michael is over, and she and Duncan resolve to begin a life together. The film ends with Gabriel's grandmother Vesuvia (Carmen Munroe) reading her family a letter from England, informing them that Gabriel and Duncan are happy together, and are expecting a child. As the family express their delight, Gabriel flies overhead, having finally attained her pilot licence and become an aviator.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the natural}} layout of the harbour, Ilfracombe became a {{significant}} safe port (registered port of refuge) on the Bristol Channel. It also had trade routes between Kinsale and Tenby, which made the port stronger. In 1208 it was listed as having provided King John with ships and men to invade Ireland; in 1247 it supplied a ship to the fleet that was sent to conquer the Western Isles of Scotland; 6 ships, with 79 men were sent to support the siege of Calais. Ilfracombe was the last disembarkation point for two large forces sent to subdue the Irish. The building which sits on Lantern Hill by the harbour, known as St Nicholas's Chapel (built 1361) is reputed to be the oldest working lighthouse in the UK; a light/beacon <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> over 650 years.|$|E

On-screen announcements said, [...] "This is Tyne Tees Television, broadcasting as Channel 3 in the North-East." [...] The new branding was launched on 2 September 1996, with [...] "Going Home (The Theme of the Local Hero)" [...] by Mark Knopfler regularly accompanying ident sequences. Following Granada's takeover, the Channel 3 branding was scrapped. As Bob Conlon, regional executive with the Independent Television Commission, said: [...] "People never really grasped the name - it didn't exactly trip off the tongue and it was still referred to as Tyne Tees Television, because it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> years."

2500|$|Later, Kiki guilt trips {{herself into}} {{accepting}} Morgan's sudden marriage proposal {{because of her}} attraction to Michael. While Kiki isn't interested in a serious relationship, she recognizes that Morgan really cares for her but she still feels something is missing. Kiki also believes marrying Morgan will help her get over Michael. By the time she marries Morgan, Kiki and Michael have made peace {{with the fact that}} they can't be together. However everything changes when it is revealed that Morgan knew Michael and Kiki weren't related before the wedding. A shocked Kiki doesn't really know how to react and though she is angry at Morgan for his lies, she is relieved that she now has a valid reason {{to walk away from the}} marriage she never truly wanted. Throughout her relationship with Michael, Kiki remains very close with Morgan. However, after her split from Morgan, the two are practically attached at the hip. Erin said Kiki is able to look back on their relationship fondly and see that [...] "Morgan <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> her this entire time" [...] and she realizes how good of a guy he is. The romantic feelings quickly resurface when the duo pretend to be romantically involved to spite Michael. [...] "Kiki has rediscovered her feelings for Morgan, for sure" [...] said Erin. The story featured actress Hayley Erin's very first onscreen kiss and her first love scene which was covered by Extra. Erin credited Bryan Craig for helping her through the scenes.

Men eat and drink, and do all manner of things, with all their might and main; but how many of them do they do to the glory of God? No; this is the fault--the especial curse of our day, that religion does not mean any longer, as it used, the service of God--the being like God, and shewing forth God's glory. No; religion means, nowadays, the art of getting to heaven when we die, and saving our own miserable, worthless souls, and getting God's wages without doing God's work--as if that was godliness,--as if that was any thing but selfishness; as if selfishness was any the better for being everlasting selfishness! If selfishness is evil, my friends, the sooner we get rid of it the better, instead of mixing it up as we do with all our thoughts of heaven, and making our own enjoyment and our own safety the vile root of our hopes for all eternity. And therefore it is that people have forgotten what God's glory is. They seem to think, that God's highest glory is saving them from hell-fire. And they talk not of God and of the wondrous majesty of God, but only of the wonder of God's having saved them--looking at themselves all the time, and not at God.

You have got a fair start, but you must not be content with that. If you have to leave, and I don’t think a longer stay here would be of use to you, I will endeavour to obtain some situation for you at Scarborough or Whitby, where you could, after your work is done, continue your education. But I beg you to do nothing rashly. It would be better if you could stay here for another year or so. We may hope that the men will not be so annoyed as you think at your refusal to take further part in the smuggling operations. At any rate, stay if you can for a time. It will be two months before I leave, and three more before I am settled in my new home at Scarborough. When I am so I have no doubt that my husband will aid me in obtaining a situation for you. He <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> years, and will, of course, have very many friends and acquaintances who would interest themselves in you. If, however, you find that your position would be intolerable, you might remain quiet as to your determination.
