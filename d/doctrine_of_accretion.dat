40|$|Australia’s {{coastline}} is in {{a continual}} state of change. The intervention of human processes, such as {{climate change and}} urbanisation, threaten to rapidly increase {{the rate at which}} the processes of accretion and erosion alter the continent’s seaward boundaries. A rapidly changing shoreline has serious implications for coastal landholders and public authorities. These implications are exacerbated by escalating land values and increasing development pressures on coastal property. This article examines the impact of climate change and urbanisation on waterfront property and the consequential risk of legal liability for public authorities. First, the article analyses the common law <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>accretion</b> and its operation in New South Wales. A case study from Sydney’s northern coastline is used to illustrate that while private interests retain a general right to benefit from natural accretion to adjacent seaward land, this right has been significantly curtailed by recent statutory changes. The second part of the article analyses the common law doctrine of erosion. While private interests may benefit from accretion, correspondingly, private interests may bear the cost of damage caused by erosion. Using another case study from Sydney’s northern beaches, the article considers whether public authorities may be liable for this damage, in light of recent case law and legislative changes. This section concludes by examining the liability of a public authority in a series of three hypothetical situations of coastal erosion. 17 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Boundaries {{are often}} {{assumed to be}} more or less certain based upon lines drawn on a survey plan. This {{assumption}} is insecure especially when dealing with water boundaries. The <b>doctrines</b> <b>of</b> erosion and <b>accretion</b> introduce into the law considerable uncertainty in ascertaining the true boundary of a parcel of land at any point in time. The resolution of this question often involves reference to complex legal, survey, historical and hydrological evidence. This uncertainty can also apply to some non-natural boundaries where undetected survey errors may result in loss to landowners while not always giving a corresponding entitlement to recover compensation...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change and}} {{consequent}} sea level rises {{over the next}} century will create major challenges for regulators determining land use. In excess of 150 million people worldwide live within one metre of mean high water mark (MHWM). Many populated areas in Australia will face challenges associated with rising sea levels in the next century. This study seeks to model {{the potential impact of}} rising sea levels on two sample parcels of land in the Great Lakes and Lake Macquarie areas of New South Wales, based on anticipated changes to MHWM. It will also explore the consequences for land ownership where boundaries are defined by MHWM using the principles outlined in the <b>Doctrine</b> <b>of</b> Erosion and <b>Accretion.</b> While there is a range of scientific opinion on the scope and speed of climate change, ranging from quite small to the catastrophic, this study has accepted the models developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2007) and regional variations for the east coast of Australia proposed by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. Anticipated sea level rises will cause inundation of low-lying land {{in many areas of the}} world including Australia. There will be a landward migration of MHWM creating ownership issues for landowners and planning issues for government and regulatory bodies. Regulatory bodies will need to proceed cautiously with future land use to avoid legal liability for a foreseen even...|$|R
40|$|The {{predicted}} rise in {{sea level}} and associated increasing storm action {{over the next}} half century is colliding with settled property law for tidal properties much of which is held on the Australian coast in private ownership. Faster change to the climate is reported with more serious risk than anticipated, with implications for sea level rise now expected at {{the upper end of}} projections by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) of around 0. 8 m by 2100 along the Australian coastline. In response to the threat of sea level rise, the six Australian States have attempted to provide information to local government and development aspirants regarding adaptation to rising sea levels however unsurprisingly there are cross-jurisdictional differences in sea level bench marks which is of concern given that much existing development along the Australian coast is of very high value. In evaluating this phenomena, it will be suggested that long settled property law particularly the common law <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> erosion and <b>accretion</b> will need to be revised to accommodate the impending collision between climate change and tidal private property. Further, the Australian Constitution at s. 51 (xxxi) sets out guarantees of compensation when private property rights are commuted, but the colonial drafters of the 1890 s would similarly never have envisaged climate effects. The tantalising prospect will be raised of whether increasing inundation of tidal private property could be construed as invoking the payment of compensation...|$|R

40|$|The Bible {{as a whole}} {{establishes}} the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin. The New Testament <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin is developed on {{the foundation of the}} Old Testament <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin. Paul and John speak particularly on the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as a whole. So a study <b>of</b> their <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin would contribute to a total Biblical understanding. The problem of this study is the Biblical <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin limited to the New Testament writers, John and Paul, as they speak <b>of</b> the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin, in relation to the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as a whole. Since the problem concerns the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as stated by the New Testament writers, John and Paul, in relation to the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as a whole, it is necessary to consider several definite facts. In order to understand sin it is first necessary to show its relationship to man in a study of theological anthropology. It is also necessary to show the relationship of Paul and John 2 ̆ 7 s <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin. In order to correctly understand either John or Paul 2 ̆ 7 s <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin it is first necessary to review the Bible teaching regarding man in relation to sin. The <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin is not understood apart from man. The study of man in relation to sin is titled 2 ̆ 2 Theological Anthropology. 2 ̆ 2 It is presented as the first study in order to fully understand man in relation to the biblical <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin. Man 2 ̆ 7 s origin, man as a sinner and man under grace are the three aspects of this study of theological anthropology. John and Paul are generally recognized as the main theologians in the New Testament. John 2 ̆ 7 s purpose in writing the Gospel was to convince the reader that this was the Christ and that believing he should have eternal life. His purpose in the First Epistle was the enhance his joy, to keep the Christian from sin, to lead them into an assurance of salvation and to warn them against error. Certain aspects <b>of</b> the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin are still presented in the Gospel. More <b>of</b> the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin appears in the First Epistle of John.
