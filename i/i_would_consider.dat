500|$|In August 2016, Lochte {{was charged}} with {{providing}} a false claim of a robbery during the 2016 Olympic Games, and if convicted could be jailed up to 18 months. On August 30, 2016, when appearing on Good Morning America, {{he said that he}} was unsure if he would claim the incident, which fulfills the requirements of [...] "armed robbery" [...] under Brazilian law, as a robbery saying [...] "I don't know if <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> it as a robbery, or extortion, or us just paying up for the poster being ripped." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{a scathing}} {{review of the}} first version, The New York Times critic Ben Brantley had said that Spider-Man may [...] "rank among the worst" [...] Broadway musicals. [...] In his review of the revised version, Brantley wrote, [...] "So is this ascent from jaw-dropping badness to mere mediocrity a step upward? Well, until last weekend ... I would have {{recommended}} Spider-Man only to carrion-feasting theater vultures. Now, if I knew a less-than-precocious child of 10 or so, and had several hundred dollars to throw away, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> taking {{him or her to}} the new and improved Spider-Man." ...|$|E
2500|$|.....imagine an {{infinitely}} intelligent {{newborn baby}} having built-in neural circuits enabling him {{to deal with}} formal logic, English syntax, and subjective probability. He might now argue, after defining a raven in detail, that it is extremely unlikely that there are any ravens, and therefore it is extremely likely that all ravens are black, that is, that [...] is true. 'On the other hand', {{he goes on to}} argue, 'if there are ravens, then there is a reasonable chance that they are of a variety of colours. Therefore, if I were to discover that even a black raven exists <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> [...] to be less probable than it was initially.' ...|$|E

60|$|I {{could not}} help smile-- the whole affair seemed so ridiculous that {{had it not been}} for the rough {{handling}} I had received when pulled from the carriage, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>considered</b> it a joke.|$|R
5000|$|The New Musical Express {{stated in}} a review of I'm Not a Fan, But the Kids Like It!, that [...] "even if I caught Prince Harry and Gary Glitter adorned in Nazi regalia defecating through my grandmother’s {{letterbox}} <b>I</b> <b>would</b> still <b>consider</b> making them listen to this album too severe a punishment." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2005, {{the delegates}} from New Jersey and Vermont of the American Veterinary Medical Association gave {{testimony}} to the organization after touring tube-feeding farms. [...] Dr. Robert Gordon had visited a farm in New York on July 5. He noted, [...] "After being on the premises, my position changed dramatically. I did not see animals <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> distressed, and I didn't see pain and suffering." [...] As written at AVMA news, Dr. Thomas Munschauer visited a New York farm {{at the request of}} [...] "both sides." [...] "I didn't see exploding esophaguses ... and it didn't seem like the birds were distressed. For the most part, they appear to be well-cared-for. That's what I saw."] ...|$|E
2500|$|George Rapp {{predicted}} that on September 15, 1829, the three and one {{half years of}} the Sun Woman would end and Christ would begin his reign on earth. Dissension grew when Rapp's predictions {{did not come to}} pass. In March 1832, one third of the group left the Society and some began following Bernhard Müller, who claimed to be the Lion of Judah. Nevertheless, most of the group stayed and Rapp continued to lead them until he died on August 7, 1847. His last words to his followers were, [...] "If I did not so fully believe, that the Lord has designated me to place our society before His presence in the land of Canaan, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> this my last".|$|E
2500|$|Durbin {{requested}} {{a meeting with}} Burris on February 24 to discuss the disclosures. Durbin told reporters that during the meeting he advised him to resign: [...] "I told him under the circumstances that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> resigning". Burris stated {{that he would not}} do so. [...] "He said he would not resign." [...] Durbin also inquered about Burris' plans for the 2010 United States Senate elections and relayed to Burris that he would be very unlikely to succeed in the primary or general election. Quinn endorsed a special election to replace Burris, but there was vocal and procedural resistance in the Illinois General Assembly. On February 25, Lisa Madigan confirmed the constitutionality of moving forward a direct election for the seat formerly held by Obama to a targeted May 26 date. The following day, a story unfolded involving Burris' son who obtained a $75,000 job under Rod Blagojevich on September 10 as a senior counsel for the state's housing authority — about six weeks after the Internal Revenue Service placed a $34,163 tax lien on Burris II and three weeks after a mortgage company filed a foreclosure suit on his South Side house.|$|E

'I hope, madam, {{you will}} not be so cruel--so tantalizing, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> say. <b>Consider,</b> you are my first client--your {{business}} my first consultation--do not do me the displeasure of withdrawing your confidence because I am a few years younger than you seem to have expected. My attention shall make amends for my want of experience.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To take extreme measures," [...] the Princess {{answered}} slowly. [...] "Mind, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>consider</b> such a {{thing for}} a moment, if I were not fully convinced that Jeanne, when she is a little older, would be perfectly satisfied {{with what we have}} done. On the other hand, one hesitates naturally to worry the child." ...|$|R
5000|$|Before <b>I</b> <b>would</b> even <b>consider</b> {{tackling}} a {{major project}} like that, though - and devoting {{a couple of}} years of my life to it - <b>I</b> <b>would</b> need a huge outpouring from all of those gamers out there that they would truly love to have another Phantas to play. If there is a big enough groundswell of support for another Phantasmagoria, and if Sierra hears it and begs me enough, I might consider it. Roberta Williams ...|$|R
2500|$|After McQueary was {{identified}} as the graduate assistant who reported the 2002 incident, he was criticized for not intervening to protect the boy from Sandusky (an accusation McQueary has since disputed), {{as well as for}} not reporting the incident to police himself. On November 7, Pennsylvania State Police Commissioner Frank Noonan said that though some may have fulfilled their legal obligation to report suspected abuse, [...] "somebody has to question about what <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> the moral requirements for a human being that knows of sexual things that are taking place with a child." [...] Noonan added that anyone who knows about suspected abuse, [...] "whether you're a football coach or a university president or the guy sweeping the building," [...] has [...] "a moral responsibility to call us." [...] Paterno said McQueary informed him that [...] "he had witnessed an incident in the shower ... but he at no time related to me the very specific actions contained in the Grand Jury report." [...] Paterno was uncertain if being more graphic would have made a difference. [...] "And to be frank with you I don't know that it would have done any good, because I never heard of, of, rape and a man," [...] said Paterno.|$|E
2500|$|Cleverly {{earned the}} interim {{version of the}} belt on 11 December 2010 in an unimpressive contest with the Frenchman Nadjib Mohammedi at the Echo Arena in Liverpool. Winning 115–112, 116–111 and 115–113 on the {{scorecards}} despite also having a point deducted Cleverly described his opponent as [...] "very awkward" [...] and said [...] "he was making me miss and dragging me in {{but this is the}} way it goes sometimes." [...] Cleverly had fought for the interim title as the full champion Jürgen Brähmer was in the midst of an appeal against a 16-month jail sentence for assault and insulting behaviour. An appeal heard in Germany on 13 December 2010 would, if Brähmer had been unsuccessful and sent to prison, have resulted in the belt being vacated and Cleverly being upgraded to the full champion status. Proceedings however didn't result in the champion being sent to prison and a fight with Brähmer was scheduled for 21 May 2011 Speaking of the match up Cleverly said that he was glad that it was going to happen saying [...] "He's the champion and the only way <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> myself a true champion is if I took the belt from him, rather than picking up the vacant title." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had {{not thought}} about that at all, {{when he came to}} me. So I told him that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> it all, and that he must come again." ...|$|E

5000|$|Deighton was {{appointed}} CEO of LOCOG after applying to an advertisement in The Economist. His appointment was announced on 19 December 2005. Deighton, a sports enthusiast, commented {{that it was}} [...] "the only job <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>considered</b> leaving Goldman Sachs for". He has been credited with contributing {{to the success of}} the London Olympics. Deighton received the Olympic Order from Count Jacques Rogge in 2012.|$|R
5000|$|In 2012, Clayton {{received}} a Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists Award. This grant enabled Clayton to develop Sufi Plug Ins, {{which he described}} as [...] "a free suite of music software-as-art based on non-western conceptions of sound and alternative interfaces". In Spin, Philip Sherburne described Sufi Plug Ins as [...] "one of the few digital tools I’ve seen that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> also <b>consider</b> art".|$|R
6000|$|... "No?" [...] said Winston. [...] "Now, of course, my {{accession}} {{will make}} a difference at Silverdale, but <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> it a friendly act if you will let me know the views of the colony." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope not, because, of course, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> it my duty in {{any case}} to fulfil the promise I have given to Mr. Malcolm MacPherson. He will be in Grafton next week, the guest of his sister, Mrs. John Seaman, across the bridge." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{told him}} {{such a thing}} was more {{rational}} than the other; but as {{this was the first}} time that ever I could imagine him weak enough to be in earnest in this affair, I did not use to say Yes at first asking; <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> of it.|$|E
5000|$|Marr {{expressed}} an interest in the Maryland head coaching job after Dave Cottle was forced out in 2010: [...] "I've always said it's a school that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> seriously <b>consider</b> if it did open up," [...] but added, [...] "I'm really excited about being at Albany ... I have no reason to move." [...] The position, however, ultimately went to former Harvard head coach John Tillman.|$|R
60|$|That a British {{sentinel}} who had dogged our footsteps held me prisoner, I had no doubt, and {{my heart}} sank like lead in my breast, for to my mind now was come {{the end of all}} things for me in this world. Because of having been taken while prowling around the village in the night, there could be no question but that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be <b>considered</b> and punished as a spy.|$|R
5000|$|Schorr {{considers}} {{herself a}} feminist, though she says: [...] "perhaps, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not be <b>considered</b> a good feminist by some people, among them ex-students of mine, {{who might have}} found me too overbearing, sacrilegious, and not nurturing {{enough to be a}} good feminist." ...|$|R
6000|$|Jimmy saw {{an opening}} and leaped for it. [...] "Oh, no!" [...] he replied. [...] "On the contrary, I wouldn't mind working into a {{permanent}} position, {{and if you}} think there might be a possibility of that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> a reasonable salary arrangement rather than the usual contract rate for expert service." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{assured him}} that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> our {{interview}} perfectly confidential; and rejoined the Doctor. As we were passing through a gallery on our way out, a well-dressed lady, of quiet and composed manners, came up, and proffering {{a slip of paper}} and a pen, begged that I would oblige her with an autograph, I complied, and we parted.|$|E
60|$|Now, if I were criticising my book, which I {{have some}} {{thoughts}} of doing, I think <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> it {{my duty to}} point out that it is far too crowded with sensational incident, and far too paradoxical in style, as far, at any rate, as the dialogue goes. I feel that from a standpoint of art these are true defects in the book. But tedious and dull the book is not.|$|E
6000|$|... "O, do not tremble, my love," [...] {{said her}} husband. [...] "I would not wrong {{either you or}} myself by working such inharmonious effects upon our lives; but <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have you <b>consider</b> how trifling, in comparison, is the skill {{requisite}} to remove this little hand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The idea of your {{ultimate}} priesthood {{has been}} so fostered {{in your mind that}} you may well {{have come to believe that}} to be a priest is your own inherent desire. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have you <b>consider</b> it well now that the time approaches for a step which is irrevocable." ...|$|R
5000|$|Hiromi was {{relocating}} to Miami Beach from Playa del Carmen, Mexico {{where she}} was living and working. Through a mutual acquaintance she met Playboy photographer, Jarmo Pohjaniemi. Oshima stated in her Playmate appearance interview, [...] "I could never have been a model in Japan. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be <b>considered</b> too busty." [...] After her discovery, she was brought to California for a test shoot {{as a candidate for}} The 50th Anniversary Playmate Hunt in the December 2003 Playboy, her first magazine appearance was the pictorial of models auditioning.|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop!" [...] {{commanded}} the major, {{with his arm}} outstretched. [...] "It seems that my book didn't lie, after all. You think your money salve will heal all the hurts of honour. Under no circumstances would I accept a loan from a casual acquaintance; and as to you, sir, I would starve before <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> your insulting offer of a financial adjustment of the circumstances we have discussed. I beg to repeat my request relative to your quitting the apartment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, {{there can}} be no {{difference}} of opinion in regard to the young man," [...] said Aunt Martha quickly. [...] "Both the others admitted that {{he had nothing to do}} with this affair except as a journalist, and although I do not think he ought to get his realistic ideas in that way, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> it positively wicked to send him into court in company with those other men. Consider the position in which he would be placed before the world. Consider his young wife." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Armadale {{presented}} himself this morning, in his noisiest high spirits, {{to announce that}} the yacht was ready for sea, and to ask when Midwinter {{would be able to}} go on board. I told him to make the inquiry himself in Midwinter's room. He left me, with a last request that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> my refusal to sail with him. I answered by a last apology for persisting in my resolution, and then took a chair alone at the window to wait the event of the interview in the next room.|$|E
60|$|Perhaps {{it will be}} {{suggested}} that success had turned my head. Very well. Granted. But the turned head remains a fact, an incontrovertible fact--my sickness, if you will, and a real sickness, and a fact. This I knew: I had reached an intellectual and artistic climacteric, a life-climacteric of some sort. And I had diagnosed my own case and prescribed this voyage. And here was the atrociously healthy and profoundly feminine Miss West along--the very last ingredient <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>considered</b> introducing into my prescription.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{has made}} up his mind to leave off {{wandering}} at once, and to give up his dependence on your generosity.
