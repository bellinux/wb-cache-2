5|$|While sharks <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> as harmless, the {{pendulum}} {{of public opinion}} quickly swung to the other extreme, and sharks quickly came to be viewed not only as eating machines, but also as fearless, ruthless killers.|$|E
5|$|WrestleMania X was {{the first}} edition of the event not to include Hulk Hogan, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> as the public face of the WWF; {{following}} Hogan's 1993 departure, that role had shifted to Bret Hart. The card also marked Randy Savage's last televised match for the company.|$|E

5|$|In 1905, The Orcadian {{newspaper}} {{reported that a}} strange creature <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> {{off the coast of}} Shapinsay. It was reportedly the size of a horse, with a spotted body covered in scales. Opinion on the creature's origin was divided, with some islanders believing it to be a sea serpent, while others opined that it was merely a large seal.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, {{while in}} South Africa filming Safari 3000 (also known as Rally), which co-starred Stockard Channing, Carradine {{was arrested for}} {{possession}} of marijuana. He was convicted and given a suspended sentence. He claimed that he was framed, in this case, by the apartheid government as he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> dancing with Tina Turner.|$|E

5|$|A July 2015 {{sighting}} of Harington arriving in Belfast, a primary filming {{location for the}} series where other actors were arriving for season 6 script read-throughs, prompted further speculation about the character's return. However, a story in Vanity Fair pointed out that Charles Dance <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> in Belfast the previous year after his character Tywin Lannister's death as well, and he only appeared in the first episode of the subsequent season as a corpse. Another photo that showed Harington on set in Belfast in a costume that varied from the Night's Watch outfit was published on September 25, 2015. A season 6 Game of Thrones promotional poster released in November 2015 featured a bloodied Jon.|$|E
5|$|Discovery {{of active}} {{volcanic}} {{activity on the}} moon Io was probably the greatest surprise. It {{was the first time}} active volcanoes <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> on another body in the Solar System. It appears that activity on Io affects the entire Jovian system. Io appears to be the primary source of matter that pervades the Jovian magnetosphere – the region of space that surrounds the planet influenced by the planet's strong magnetic field. Sulfur, oxygen, and sodium, apparently erupted by Io's volcanoes and sputtered off the surface by impact of high-energy particles, were detected at {{the outer edge of the}} magnetosphere of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Hardy next {{competed in}} the SmackDown! King of the Ring tournament, losing to {{eventual}} winner Booker T in the opening round thanks to a low blow and distraction from Sharmell. Hardy also became {{the first man to}} defeat Mr. Kennedy in singles' competition. On July 25, after the SmackDown! taping, Hardy was taken out of action after doctors found the remnants of the staph infection that had plagued him the previous year. He was sidelined until August 25 while he healed. Hardy made a surprise appearance backstage at Unforgiven after Jeff's match against Johnny Nitro. Lita joined the two in the segment, making this the first time the three <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> together on WWE television since February 2003.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, {{the only}} Class-A fishery {{waters in the}} Nescopeck Creek {{watershed}} were those of Little Nescopeck Creek A, the headwaters of Nescopeck Creek, and several minor tributaries of Nescopeck Creek. Only one small stream near Nescopeck Creek's mouth had Class-C fishery waters. The central part of Nescopeck Creek, {{as well as most}} of Black Creek had Class-D fishery waters. There were twenty species of fish in Nescopeck Creek in 1999. Of these, seventeen <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> in the watershed before. However, since between a 1999 study of the watershed and the study before that, the brown bullhead and the bluegill fish had vanished from the Nescopeck Creek watershed.|$|E
5|$|Jean, who had adapted and {{directed}} Hogfather in 2006, was keen {{to return to}} some of the locations used in that film to provide continuity. The scenes in the Great hall of the Unseen University were filmed in the crypt of the Guildhall in the City of London, and the same Victorian country home was used for Death's house as <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> in Hogfather. This time around, Jean was able to film more extensive panoramic shots in the latter location, thanks to The Colour of Magic's larger budget. Other filming locations included Anglesey and Snowdonia for exterior shots, Gloucester docks as the docks of Ankh-Morpork, and the Royal Courts of Justice as the Patrician's Palace.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-10c is an {{exoplanet}} {{orbiting the}} G-type star Kepler-10, located around 568 light-years away in Draco. Its discovery was announced by Kepler in May 2011, although it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> as a planetary candidate since January 2011, when Kepler-10b was discovered. The team confirmed the observation {{using data from}} NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope and a technique called Blender that ruled out most false positives. Kepler-10c was the third transiting planet to be confirmed statistically (based on probability rather than actual observation), after Kepler-9d and Kepler-11g. The Kepler team considers the statistical method {{that led to the}} discovery of Kepler-10c as what will be necessary to confirm many planets in Kepler's field of view.|$|E

5|$|Several Jews {{and other}} {{survivors}} of the Holocaust dedicated themselves to finding Eichmann and other Nazis. Among them was the Jewish Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal. Wiesenthal learned from a letter shown to him in 1953 that Eichmann <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> in Buenos Aires, and he passed along that information to the Israeli consulate in Vienna in 1954. When Eichmann's father died in 1960, Wiesenthal made arrangements for private detectives to surreptitiously photograph members of the family, as Eichmann's brother Otto was said to bear a strong family resemblance {{and there were no}} current photos of the fugitive. He provided these photographs to Mossad agents on 18 February.|$|E
5|$|Sphenodon guntheri {{is present}} {{naturally}} on one small island {{with a population}} of approximately 400. In 1995, 50juvenile and 18adult Brothers Island tuatara were moved to Titi Island in Cook Strait, and their establishment monitored. Two years later, {{more than half of the}} animals <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> again and of those all but one had gained weight. In 1998, 34juveniles from captive breeding and 20 wild-caught adults were similarly transferred to Matiu/Somes Island, a more publicly accessible location within Wellington Harbour. The captive juveniles were from induced layings from wild females.|$|E
5|$|The California condor {{conservation}} project {{may be one}} of {{the most}} expensive species conservation projects in United States history, costing over $35million, including $20million in federal and state funding, since World War II. As of 2007 the annual cost for the condor conservation program was around $2.0 million per year. However, nesting milestones have been recently reached by the reintroduced condors. In 2003, the first nestling fledged in the wild since 1981. In March 2006, a pair of California condors, released by Ventana Wildlife Society, attempted to nest in a hollow tree near Big Sur, California. This was the first time in more than 100 years that a pair of California condors <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> nesting in Northern California.|$|E

50|$|Not all {{scientists}} {{are convinced that}} the observed signatures are caused by a ring system.

5|$|The Netherlands Film Festival and the Netherlands Film Fund {{announced}} the Golden Film on September 4, 2001.

5|$|The mallard usually feeds by dabbling {{for plant}} food or grazing; {{there are reports}} of it eating frogs. However, in 2017 a flock of mallards in Romania were {{observed}} hunting small migratory birds, including grey wagtail and black redstart, the first documented occasion they <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> attacking and consuming large vertebrates. It usually nests on a river bank, but not always near water. It is highly gregarious outside of the breeding season and forms large flocks, which are known as sords.|$|E
5|$|The {{police had}} only two clues: some {{footprints}} in the garden, and a hat that they found in a nearby gutter.
