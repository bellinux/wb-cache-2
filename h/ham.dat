Three minutes later, Liverpool made another substitution, as Alonso went off with an injury to be replaced by defender Jan Kromkamp. Minutes later, West <b>Ham</b> captain Nigel Reo-Coker had an attempt to score, but his shot went over the Liverpool goal. West <b>Ham</b> subsequently made their first substitution of the match, as Ashton was replaced by fellow striker Bobby Zamora. Liverpool also replaced Crouch with midfielder Dietmar Hamann.|$|E

5|$|He was {{replaced}} by former player Billy Bonds. In Bonds' first full season, 1990–91, West <b>Ham</b> again secured promotion to Division One. Now back in the top flight, Bonds saw West <b>Ham</b> through {{one of their most}} controversial seasons. With the club planning to introduce a bond scheme, there was crowd unrest. West <b>Ham</b> finished last and were relegated back to Division Two after only one season. However, they rebounded strongly in 1992–93. With Trevor Morley and Clive Allen scoring 40 goals, they guaranteed themselves second place {{on the last day of}} the season with a 2–0 home win against Cambridge United, and with it promotion to the Premier League.|$|E
5|$|In 2013–14, West <b>Ham</b> {{finished}} 13th in the Premier League. They also {{reached the}} semi-finals of the League Cup before losing 9–0 on aggregate to eventual cup-winners Manchester City. A {{feature of the}} season were the criticisms of manager Sam Allardyce by supporters relating to his perceived negative playing tactics. West <b>Ham</b> finished 12th in the 2014–15 Premier League, one place higher than the previous season. Minutes after the last game of the season, on 24 May 2015, the club announced that Allardyce's contract would not be renewed {{and that they were}} seeking a new manager. By winning the Premier League Fair Play table for 2014–15, West <b>Ham</b> qualified for the 2015–16 UEFA Europa League, entering at the first qualifying round. On 9 June 2015, former West <b>Ham</b> player Slaven Bilić was appointed as manager on a three-year contract. In Bilić's fourth game in charge, the team won at Anfield {{for the first time in}} 52 years, beating Liverpool 0–3, with goals from Manuel Lanzini, Mark Noble and Diafra Sakho. In Bilić's first season as manager, West <b>Ham</b> finished seventh in the Premier League. The team broke several records for the club in the Premier League era, including the highest number of points (62), the highest number of goals in a season (65), the least number of games lost in a season (8) and the lowest number of away defeats (5). Following Manchester United's win in the 2016 FA Cup Final, West <b>Ham</b> took their Europa League place and qualified for the third qualifying round of the 2016–17 edition. In August 2016, André Ayew became the club's most expensive signing after joining for a fee of £20.5million from Swansea City. At the end of the 2016–17 Premier League season West <b>Ham</b> finished 11th.|$|E

5|$|In the 2007–08 season, West <b>Ham</b> {{remained}} reasonably consistently in the {{top half}} of the league table, with Fredrik Ljungberg in the team, despite a slew of injuries; new signing Craig Bellamy missed most of the campaign, while Kieron Dyer was out from August 2007. The last game of the season, at the Boleyn Ground, saw West <b>Ham</b> draw 2–2 against Aston Villa, ensuring a tenth-place finish three points ahead of rivals Tottenham Hotspur. It was a five-place improvement on the previous season, and most importantly West <b>Ham</b> were never under any realistic threat of relegation.|$|E
5|$|Jarvis {{submitted}} a transfer request on 11 August 2012, after media reports linked West <b>Ham</b> United with the player.

5|$|Liverpool's first {{opportunity}} came a minute later, after West <b>Ham</b> midfielder Carl Fletcher conceded a free kick for a foul on Gerrard. However, the resulting free kick was hit {{into the wall}} of players {{in front of the}} West <b>Ham</b> penalty area. A few minutes later, West <b>Ham</b> scored the first goal of the match; Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso gave the ball away to Benayoun, who played it inside to Ashton. Ashton then played a through-ball to Lionel Scaloni on the right flank, before the Argentine's low cross was put into his own goal by Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher to give West <b>Ham</b> a 1–0 lead. Seven minutes later, West <b>Ham</b> extended their lead, when Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina fumbled a shot from Etherington into the path of Ashton, who squeezed the rebound under Reina into the far corner to make it 2–0. Liverpool looked to have reduced the defect in the 30th minute, but Peter Crouch's shot from a Gerrard free kick was disallowed as Crouch was offside.|$|E

5|$|On 8 June 2011, it was {{confirmed}} that the Westfield Shopping Centre had been in detailed talks with West <b>Ham</b> for naming rights of the new Olympic stadium which could be called the Westfield Stadium. West <b>Ham</b> announced plans to move from the Boleyn Ground from the 2014–15 season. In August 2011, an independent investigation initiated by the Olympic Park Legacy Company upheld the decision to award West <b>Ham</b> the Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Games. On 29 June 2011, however, Tottenham announced that they were returning to the High Court again to fight the decision to award West <b>Ham</b> the stadium, in an oral hearing, to try and overturn the original high court appeal being rejected. On 25 August 2011, Tottenham and Leyton Orient were in fact granted a judicial review by the High Court into the Olympic Stadium bidding process. On 11 October 2011, the deal to award West <b>Ham</b> the Olympic Stadium collapsed over concerns of legal pressure, with the government deciding that the stadium will stay in public ownership. Six days later, Tottenham and Leyton Orient announced they had ended their legal challenge after the deal collapsed.|$|E
5|$|Pat Holland, an FA Cup {{winner in}} 1975 with West <b>Ham,</b> served as Millwall {{assistant}} manager to Willie Donachie in 2006.

In June 2011 former Millwall player Sam Allardyce was appointed as manager of West <b>Ham.</b> In June 2013 Millwall appointed former Hammers captain Steve Lomas as their new manager. Lomas joined ex-West <b>Ham</b> defender Tim Breacker, who was Millwall's first-team coach. As a former West <b>Ham</b> player, Lomas' appointment was unpopular with many Millwall fans. Lomas was sacked on 26 December 2013, after winning only five of his 22 games in charge.|$|E
25|$|In telecommunication, a <b>Hamming</b> code is {{a linear}} error-correcting code. <b>Hamming</b> codes can detect {{up to two}} {{simultaneous}} bit errors, and correct single-bit errors; thus, reliable communication is possible when the <b>Hamming</b> distance between the transmitted and received bit patterns is {{less than or equal}} to one. By contrast, the simple parity code cannot correct errors, and can only detect an odd number of errors. <b>Hamming</b> codes are of fundamental importance in coding theory and remain of practical use in modern computer design. <b>Hamming</b> codes were invented in 1950 by Richard <b>Hamming</b> at Bell Labs.|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the genetic relationship between enzymatic activity of raw <b>hams</b> and firmness of dry-cured <b>hams.</b> Instrumental firmness and sensory panel firmness scores were obtained from 2058 and 3275 dry-cured <b>hams,</b> respectively. On a sub-sample of 988 raw <b>hams</b> for dry-curing, enzymatic activity of cathepsin B was determined through a fluorimetric analytical method. A multiple-trait animal model was used to estimate heritability and genetic correlations of these traits. Estimates of heritability were moderate, ranging from 0. 11 for sensory panel firmness scores to 0. 25 for cathepsin B activity. Genetic correlations between firmness measures on dry-cured <b>hams</b> and enzymatic activity of raw <b>hams</b> were low.

5|$|The {{oldest and}} fiercest rivalry is with Millwall. The {{two sides are}} local rivals, having both formed {{originally}} around local companies, with players {{living in the same}} localities. The early history of both clubs are intertwined, with West <b>Ham</b> proving to be the more successful in a number of meetings between the two teams at the time, resulting in West <b>Ham</b> being promoted at the expense of Millwall. Millwall later declined to join the fledgling Football League while West <b>Ham</b> went on to the top division and an FA Cup final. Later in the 1920s, the rivalry was intensified during strike action which Isle of Dogs-based companies (i.e., Millwall fans) refused to support, breeding ill will between the two camps, the bitterness of this betrayal enduring for years. In 1972, a Millwall supporter died at New Cross station after falling out of a train during a fight with West <b>Ham</b> fans.|$|E
