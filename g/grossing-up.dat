This paper deals with the selection of the Danish survey and the <b>grossing-up</b> estimation. Focus, however, is on the Danish methods of survey maintenance over the medium term insuring both high total survey coverage and broad coverage in terms of instruments and sectors. Many countries with survey-based systems confront similar challenges and the working paper can hopefully be of inspiration and generate discussion. In the Danish system equity, intercompany debt, etc., loans and deposits, other investments, trade credits and financial derivatives are survey-covered for the sectors non-financial corporations, other financial intermediaries and insurance and pension funds. Using a dynamic register on financial account data and simple statistical methods the survey coverage on equity is maintained and the <b>grossing-up</b> is dynamically re-estimated. For intercompany debt, etc., loans and deposits, and other investments a method has been developed to maintain coverage over time while <b>grossing-up</b> is assumed constant. Trade credit coverage and <b>grossing-up</b> is maintained by a very sim-ple method using foreign trade statistics. Derivatives and financial leasing are assumed covered by the survey...|$|E

We find important discrepancies between the data weighted with baseline <b>grossing-up</b> weights and official statistics from other sources. A number of re-weighting exercises is examined from the point of view of the accuracy of microsimulation results and we show that using a combination of demographic calibration targets with several economic status variables or tax identifiers from the microsimulation model substantially improves the correspondence of model results and administrative data. While demographic re-weighting is neutral from the point of view of income distribution, calibrating the <b>grossing-up</b> weights to adjust for economic status and tax identifiers significantly increases income inequality. We argue that although data reweighting can substantially improve the accuracy of microsimulation it should be used with caution...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a <b>grossing-up</b> {{algorithm}} {{that allows for}} gross income calculation based on tax rules and observed variables in the sample. The algorithm is applicable in tax-benefit microsimulation models, which are mostly used by taxation policy makers to support government legislative processes. Typically, tax-benefit microsimulation models are based on datasets, where only the net income is known, though the data about gross income is needed to successfully simulate the impact of taxation policies on the economy. The algorithm that we propose allows for an exact reproduction of a missing variable by applying a set of taxation rules that are known {{to refer to the}} variable in question and to other variables in the dataset during the data generation process. Researchers and policy makers can adapt the proposed algorithm with respect to the rules and variables in their legislative environment, which allows for complete and exact restoration of the missing variable. The algorithm incorporates an estimation of partial analytical solutions and a trial-and-error approach to find the initial true value. Its validity was proven by a set of tax rule combinations at different levels of income that are used in contemporary tax systems. The algorithm is generally applicable, with some modifications, for data imputation on datasets derived from various tax systems around the world.

40|$|The first {{chapters}} of the thesis put special emphasis on tax-benefit microsimulation models. The {{state of the art}} in the economic literature of tax-benefit microsimulation models is reviewed and discussed. Particular attention is paid to issues such as the reliability of estimation and the <b>grossing-up</b> of the sample. In order to analyze tax-benefit microsimulation, a new model is developed focusing on the case of Italy: it shares many features with other country-specific tax-benefit microsimulation models. The model, appropriately calibrated to population totals, is also used for an estimation of tax evasion via comparison with a number of different data sources. Non-parametric density estimation is used to improve the understanding of policy simulations and to analyze the effect of fiscal reform: an application to the 1998 Italian personal income taxation reform is provided. The first part concludes with an analysis of the reliability of microsimulation models, which has been addressed by few authors before. The analysis is undertaken using the bootstrap, which tends to show a better performance in finite sample than asymptotic approximations. The main result is that static microsimulation does not by itself make confidence intervals larger: on the contrary they can also make it smaller. To improve the reliability of microsimulation models the best way to proceed is to reduce the sampling error of the available data sets. In the remaining chapters the thesis analyzes how microsimulation models can be useful in understanding the causes of inequality trends. As a preliminary step, the review and discussion of the literature about the main methods for inequality decomposition is provided. Based on this, a combination of two recent microsimu-lation methods is proposed to analyze the trend of inequality in Italy in 1977 - 2000. It is found that analysis using traditional methods of inequality decomposition can be seriously misleading if the sample is not representative of the whole population in some of its dimensions, such as female labor force participation. Microsimulation techniques can overcome this problem and can account for the major factors that driving inequality. Finally, the thesis discusses the issue of inference with thick-tailed distributions, such as the Pareto distribution with infinite second moment, that is of special relevance to empirical analysis of income distribution. It is shown that inference based on the standard t-ratio statistic can induce a non negligible error in rejection probability. Some solutions are suggested with an application to Italian household income data...|$|E
