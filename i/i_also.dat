5|$|Aimery of Lusignan died on 1 April 1205 and a {{few months}} later, his widow (Alice's mother), Isabella <b>I,</b> <b>also</b> died. Isabella I's fourteen-year-old {{daughter}} from her second marriage to Conrad of Montferrat, Maria, ascended the throne with Isabella I's half-brother, John of Ibelin, acting as regent. As the new queen's eldest half-sister, Alice became heir presumptive. She was placed under the guardianship of her maternal grandmother, Maria Komnene, according to historian Bernard Hamilton.|$|E
5|$|Do I wish I {{had never}} endured post-partum depression? Absolutely. But {{to deny the}} {{experience}} is to deny who I am.

5|$|Later Sulien, now Bishop of St David's (he was bishop 1073–1078 and 1080–1086), himself {{took refuge}} at Llanbadarn Fawr from the Vikings who were raiding St David's. Many {{of the bishops}} were murdered by raiders and marauders, {{including}} Bishop Morgeneu <b>I</b> (<b>also</b> known as Morgenveth, Morgeney, Uregeneu) in 999 and Bishop Abraham (who had been newly elected to succeed Sulien) in 1080.|$|E

5|$|Despite his successes, when Edward I died in 1307 {{he left a}} {{range of}} {{challenges}} for his son to resolve. One {{of the most critical}} was the problem of English rule in Scotland, where Edward's long but ultimately inconclusive military campaign was ongoing when he died. Edward's control of Gascony created tension with the French kings. They insisted that the English kings should give homage to them for the lands; the English kings saw this demand as insulting to their honour, and the issue remained unresolved. Edward <b>I</b> <b>also</b> faced increasing opposition from his barons over the taxation and requisitions required to resource his wars, and left his son debts of around £200,000 on his death.|$|E
5|$|In 1798, Tsar Paul I of Russia offered Louis {{the use of}} Jelgava Palace in Courland (now Latvia). Paul <b>I</b> <b>also</b> {{guaranteed}} Louis's {{safety and}} bestowed upon him a generous pension, however, the tsar later disregarded this allowance. Marie-Thérèse finally joined Louis XVIII at Jelgava in 1799. In the winter of 1798–1799, Louis XVIII wrote a biography of Marie Antoinette titled Réflexions Historiques sur Marie Antoinette. He attempted to recreate the court life of Versailles at Jelgava, where many old courtiers lived, re-establishing all the court ceremonies, including the lever and coucher (ceremonies that accompanied waking and bedding, respectively).|$|E
5|$|South Indian mercenaries {{were often}} {{employed}} in the armies of the Anuradhapura Kingdom during its latter stages. Manavamma and Moggallana I (491–508) obtained {{the assistance of the}} Pallavas during succession disputes to secure the throne. However, the Anuradhapura kingdom appears to have had strong armies during some periods, such as when Sena II sent his armies to South India against the Pandyan king. Gajabahu <b>I</b> <b>also</b> launched an invasion against South India to rescue 12,000 captives, and brought back 12,000 prisoners as well as the freed captives. Surprisingly however, a navy was not considered important during the Anuradhapura Kingdom, and one was rarely maintained. This would have been the first line of defence for the island nation and would also have been helpful in dealing with invasions from South India.|$|E

5|$|Stephen I granted {{privileges}} to the Roman Catholic Church, {{for example}} by ordering the general {{imposition of the}} tithe upon the population. Burials in most local pre-Christian cemeteries, for example at Hunedoara, only ceased around 1100. Stephen <b>I</b> <b>also</b> divided his kingdom, including the territories of modern Romania he had occupied, into counties, that is administrative units around royal fortresses, each administered by a royal official called count. In time the voivode, a higher royal official first attested in 1176, became the principal of all the counts in Transylvania. In contrast with Transylvania, the counts in modern Banat and Crişana remained {{in direct contact with}} the king who appointed and replaced them at will.|$|E
5|$|The Sun-grazing comets {{observed}} in 1843 (Great Comet of 1843) and 1963 (Comet Pereyra) {{seem to be}} closely related and belong to the subgroup I, although when their orbits are traced back to one previous perihelion, {{the differences between the}} orbital elements are still rather large, probably implying that they broke apart from each other one revolution before that. They may not be related to the comet of 1106, but rather a comet that returned about 50 years before that. Subgroup <b>I</b> <b>also</b> includes comets seen in 1695, 1880 (Great Southern Comet of 1880) and in 1887 (Great Southern Comet of 1887), as well as the vast majority of comets detected by the SOHO mission (see below).|$|E

25|$|When I {{returned}} to IP in 1962 {{as president and}} editor-in-chief the house faced bankruptcy. Its publishing program had practically ceased, its debt to the publishers' services was so great without any prospect of payment in sight that the printers refused to undertake new work and the binders refused to release our books in stock. Fortunately, Trachty had some reserve funds that I drew upon immediately. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> arranged small loans {{from a number of}} our devoted readers. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> sent out an unprecedented appeal for donations to keep the publishing house going. We were thus able to meet the payroll and office expenses, and also to pay off enough of our debt to resume publishing.|$|E
