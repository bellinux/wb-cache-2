40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to apply a new {{backward}} and forward dispersion approach, starting from the original Rasmussen definition, which can give further insight into the interactions between industries and institutional sectors in a multiregional framework. The method is based on identification of the Macro Multipliers and the related <b>impact</b> <b>components</b> of a model based on a bi-regional SAM, which allows for {{the representation of the}} bi-regional multisectoral and multi-industry model in a two-dimensional space defined by the two dominating <b>impact</b> <b>components.</b> From such representation, we derive a set of indices of intraregional and interregional backward and forward dispersion that identifies key groups of industries and institutional sectors. The strength of these groups is further evaluated in terms of correlation of the <b>impact</b> <b>components</b> within the groups and cross-correlation between industry and institutional sectors groups.

40|$|Food aromas {{generally}} are complex mixtures of volatiles. In the present study, we investigated the joint effects of hexyl acetate, trans- 2 -hexenal and 1 -hexanol on the multi-attribute perception of an apple aroma. The first two substances were identified earlier as positive {{contributors to the}} apple aroma (high character impact), whereas the third component was identified as an irrelevant or negative contributor (low character impact). Aroma quality was quantified using a set of eight graphic rating scales. All three components had significant effects on the aroma profiles. These effects consist mainly of an effect of each component on the attribute that described its individual character and an effect of all three components on ratings on the main character attribute `apple'. As expected, the high impact components increased `apple' ratings, whereas the low character <b>impact</b> <b>component</b> decreased `apple' ratings. Furthermore, intensity ratings on the attribute that corresponded with the odour of the low <b>impact</b> <b>component</b> were suppressed {{by the presence of}} high impact components. These results indicate that the contributions of odorants to the mixture's aroma are not linear combinations of separate odour intensities, because sensory interactions were observed. In addition, humans detect components in complex mixtures more accurately than studies on identification performance have suggested. We conclude that for an adequate assessment of the effects of multiple mixture components on changes in aroma perception, it is sufficient to employ multiple response scales measuring intensities of attributes that are distinctive with respect to the expected qualitative changes. Results of this approach should be subjected to multivariate methods of statistical analysi...|$|E

Our framework allows one to compute the average price trajectory {{in the presence of}} a meta-order, that consistently generalizes previously proposed propagator models. We account for the universally observed square-root impact law, and predict non-trivial trajectories when trading is interrupted or reversed. We prove that our framework is free of price manipulation, and that prices can be made diffusive (albeit with a generic short-term mean-reverting contribution).

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{approaches for}} condition monitoring of roller bearings {{are almost always}} achieved under Shannon sampling theorem conditions, leading to a big-data problem. The compressed sensing (CS) theory provides a new solution to the big-data problem. However, the vibration signals are insufficiently sparse {{and it is difficult}} to achieve sparsity using the conventional techniques, which impedes the application of CS theory. Therefore, it is of great significance to promote the sparsity when applying the CS theory to fault diagnosis of roller bearings. To increase the sparsity of vibration signals, a sparsity-promoted method called the tunable Q-factor wavelet transform based on decomposing the analyzed signals into transient <b>impact</b> <b>components</b> and high oscillation components is utilized in this work. The former become sparser than the raw signals with noise eliminated, whereas the latter include noise. Thus, the decomposed transient <b>impact</b> <b>components</b> replace the original signals for analysis. The CS theory is applied to extract the fault features without complete reconstruction, which means that the reconstruction can be completed when the components with interested frequencies are detected and the fault diagnosis can be achieved during the reconstruction procedure. The application cases prove that the CS theory assisted by the tunable Q-factor wavelet transform can successfully extract the fault features from the compressed samples...|$|R

Optimal cash trading strategies consist of a manipulation component and a liquidity provision for the other traders in the market.

40|$|Wind {{turbines}} {{are subject}} {{to a wide range}} of environmental conditions during a lifespan that can conceivably extend beyond 20 years. Hailstone impact is thought to be a key factor in the leading edge erosion and damage of wind turbine blades. Along with the size and density of the hailstone, the aggregated impact velocity components are crucial variables that characterise the kinetic energy associated with singular impact. These components include: the terminal velocity of the hailstone, the mean wind speed and the rotational speed of the turbine. Theorised values for the impact velocity may not truly reflect the conditions experienced by wind turbine blades. Using UK meteorological data, a greater representation of hail characteristics, occurrence probabilities and realistic <b>impact</b> <b>component</b> velocities is proposed, which will assist in the development of a realistic damage model for hailstone impact...|$|E
