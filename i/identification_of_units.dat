The study area is the N 1 plateau located on the northern border of the Carajás Mineral Province, the most important Brazilian mineral province which has numerous mineral deposits, particularly the world’s largest iron deposits. The plateau is covered by low-density savanna-type vegetation (campus rupestres) which contrasts visibly with the dense equatorial forest. The laterites are subdivided into three units: chemical crust, iron-ore duricrust, and hematite, of which only the latter two are of economic interest.

In two out of seven Deiters neurones tested the antidromic invasion elicited by spinal cord stimulation was suppressed. In rats, whose inferior olive was previously destroyed, cooling of the inferior olive region was not followed by the powerful depression of spike activity seen in the vestibular and cerebellar nuclei cells in the intact rats.

40|$|This article {{reports the}} results of {{empirical}} work carried out in a project funded by the UK Government’s Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). The project was concerned with operationalising knowledge management concepts {{in the context of}} interorganisational innovation. The companies that collaborated in this project were a major manufacturer of powered garden machinery and a major mobile telephone operator. The technique, which has been developed, operationalises the concepts of: tacit and explicit knowledge, radical and incremental innovation, and the five basic knowledge management processes: externalisation, dissemination, internalisation, socialisation, and discontinuous learning. The technique involves each participating party identifying the features that the successful innovation needs to possess. This is followed by the identification of the knowledge gaps that must be bridged if each feature is to be achieved. These knowledge gaps constitute the units of analysis. For each unit of analysis/knowledge gap, the size of the gap, {{and the nature of the}} required knowledge are estimated subjectively by each project team member. This allows both the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>units</b> which have high risk and the nature of the knowledge transformation processes, which need to be managed.

40|$|Plant species often {{adapt to}} local {{environmental}} conditions, which {{can result in}} the formation of genetically and phenotypically distinct ecotypes. Ecotypes can evolve rapidly, and may be a first step in the process of ecological speciation. Consequently, ecotypes may constitute {{an important part of the}} biodiversity in regions with a young flora, where few endemic taxa at the species level have had the time to evolve. The lack of knowledge regarding species showing evidence of ecotypic differentiation may, however, hamper proper taxonomic treatment and <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>units</b> for conservation. In this thesis we study the intraspecific variation of the annual hemiparasitic herb Rhinanthus angustifolius. The species is divided into several subspecies that generally are assumed to be ecotypes. Some of the putative ecotypes are connected to traditionally managed human-created habitats that are threatened by changes in management practices. However, the distinctness and conservation value of the putative ecotypes remain unknown. Phenotypic plasticity may, for example, blur or exaggerate genetically based differences. Here, we use a combination of common-garden experiments and molecular genetic analyses to study local adaptation, phenotypic plasticity and geographical structure within R. angustifolius. Moreover, we evaluate the distinctness of three putative ecotypes occurring in Sweden today. Our results support a history of genetic adaptation to local environmental conditions in Scandinavia after the last ice age. However, we observe a complex pattern of phenotypic variation rather than formation of distinct ecotypes. The major exception is a fen ecotype occurring in a few calcareous spring fens on the Baltic island of Gotland. In congruence with previous studies on R. angustifolius and closely related species, we show that phenotypic plasticity affects some characters that are used to delimit infraspecific taxa within the species. Results from our molecular genetic analyses indicate that geographically isolated populations of R. angustifolius have adapted to similar environmental conditions resulting in incongruent patterns of phenotypic and molecular-genetic variation, and repeated evolution of distinct fen ecotypes. We discuss the taxonomic value of ecotypes and currently recognized subspecies, and their usefulness as conservation units...|$|E
3000|$|The {{available}} techniques for <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> flow <b>units</b> <b>of</b> shaly sandstone reservoirs {{are based on}} different concepts, do not provide satisfactory results, and usually show discrepancy. This research is devoted to evaluating current techniques and developing a new concept capable to identify flow units constituting shaly sandstone reservoirs. A new mathematical model has been developed and validated to identify flow units in shaly sandstone reservoirs. The newly developed concept is called shale number (SN) and combines rock properties, fluid properties, petrophysical properties, and hydraulic flow conditions of shaly reservoir rocks. Fifteen actual, reserved, and fracture-free reservoir samples of shaly sandstone reservoir are used to develop SEM images and measure required rock properties of porosity, permeability, and oil/brine relative permeability. The developed data using SEM images and lab experiments are used to characterize the rocks, test feasibility of permeability-porosity crossplot and flow zone index (FZI) techniques, and validate the newly developed mathematical model. The results revealed that the SEM images are capable to identify the clay types as detrital clays and hairy illites plus clay distribution as filling micropores and coating grains of shaly sandstone formations. The results have proven that techniques of porosity–permeability crossplot and FZI have severe scattering degree of data and poor capability for <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> flow <b>units</b> <b>of</b> shaly sandstone reservoirs. The developed model of SN has been validated and showed superior accuracy in application. A plot of SN versus reservoir quality ([...] √(K/φ)) [...] provided unique straight lines passing through the origin and capable to delineate flow <b>units</b> <b>of</b> shaly sandstone reservoirs. The newly developed shale number overcomes several drawbacks of previous and current techniques used for <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> flow <b>units.</b> Therefore, {{the application of the}} new technique provides improved reservoir description of shaly sandstone reservoirs, which secures better development planning.|$|R
