50|$|When you are {{exploring}} islands and dig for treasure, your energy meter will decrease. For example, you lose 5 energy {{every time you}} dig a ground; you lose 10 energy when you mine a rock, and you lose 7 energy when you dig cut a plant or a tree. You can refill your energy meter by waiting for 5 minutes which is equivalent to 1 energy level; or by consuming fruits which you can get by either as gifts from friends or rewards while digging, after which you will gain 1 energy point. You can send fruits as gifts to your neighbors, and most likely, you can receive one as well. Each fruits available as gifts have corresponding energy level: pineapple has the biggest amount which gives off 25 energy; coconut has 20; mango has 15; banana has 10; and kiwi has 5.You can also grow your own fruit, which takes a varied amount of time (from 1 hour to 1 day). Another way to get energy is by asking your friends for an energy pack which will refill your energy meter. The request for energy pack is available daily. Or you may opt to purchase this energy pack from the store for 10 island cash. Moreover, you can level up easily by completely digging an island as it rewards additional points. Each <b>increase</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> gains one additional energy in your total energy meter.

40|$|AbstractBeginning {{from the}} 1960 ies {{sustainability}} has been being pointed {{out as an}} important criterion in development which made many countries plan sustainability originated progressing policies. The decision makers, planning to construct a third roadway bridge to connect Asia and Europe continents on to the Bosphorus in Istanbul metropolitan area, first have to evaluate the exaggerated road traffic congestion phenomenon. Before making such a non-environmentally friend decision, advanced traffic managing strategies have to be incorporated to regularize the current pattern of traffic flows on the existing road network that prevails the road based urban transport. Ramp control is an efficient strategy that has been employed to prevent recurrent traffic congestion since 1970 ies. With the employment of ramp control applications, several benefits of ramp management, including i. e., the <b>increase</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of traffic safety, the increase on travelling speeds and consequently decrease on travelling times, the increase on the level-of-service, increase on energy consumption efficiency, decrease on environmental impacts, and increase on user satisfaction, have been experienced.

40|$|The central {{event in}} protein misfolding {{disorders}} (PMDs) is {{the accumulation of}} a misfolded form of a naturally expressed protein. Despite the diversity of clinical symptoms associated with different PMDs, many similarities in their mechanism suggest that distinct pathologies may cross talk at the molecular level. The main goal {{of this study was}} to analyze the interaction of the protein misfolding processes implicated in Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s and prion diseases. For this purpose, we inoculated prions in an Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s transgenic mouse model that develop typical amyloid plaques and followed the progression of pathological changes over time. Our findings show a dramatic acceleration and exacerbation of both pathologies. The onset of prion disease symptoms in transgenic mice appeared significantly faster with a concomitant <b>increase</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of misfolded prion protein in the brain. A striking increase in amyloid plaque deposition was observed in prion-infected mice compared with their noninoculated counterparts. Histological and biochemical studies showed the association of the two misfolded proteins in the brain and in vitro experiments showed that protein misfolding can be enhanced by a cross-seeding mechanism. These results suggest a profound interaction between Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s and prion pathologies, indicating that one protein misfolding process may be an important risk factor for the development of a second one. Our findings may have important implications to understand the origin and progression of PMDs...|$|E

Developing early to mid-cotyledonary MD embryos at 16 to 19 d in culture were treated with 10 [mu]M hormone/metabolite for 4 d. At various times during incubation, embryos and medium were analyzed to determine levels of hormone/metabolite, VLCMFAs, and oleosin or [delta] 15 desaturase transcripts. The VLCMFAs, 20 : 1 and 22 : 1, primarily in triacylglycerols, increased by 200 % after 72 h in the presence of (+) -ABA and 8 [prime]-OH ABA relative to the control. In contrast, treatment with PA for 72 h had little effect (20 % <b>increase)</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of VLCMFAs. The first 24 to 72 h of (+) -ABA treatment were critical in the induction of VLCMFA biosynthesis, with 8 [prime]-OH ABA lagging slightly behind (+) -ABA in promoting this response. The accumulation of VLCMFAs was positively correlated with an increase in elongase activity. (+) -ABA and its 8 [prime]-OH ABA metabolite induced the accumulation of a 19 -kD oleosin transcript within 2 to 4 h in culture. In addition, both (+) -ABA and 8 [prime]-OH ABA induced the same level of [delta] 15 desaturase transcript by 8 h. PA had no effect on the induction of either oleosin or [delta] 15 desaturase transcripts.

40|$|This {{report is}} {{presented}} to the Print and Packaging Forum in fulfilment of the activities envisaged under Research Agreement signed between the Leadership, Innovation and Knowledge Research Centre DCU and the Irish Printing and Packaging Forum dated 15 July 2010. The remainder of this report sets out our research findings and response to the requirements {{set out in the}} Research Agreement. Section 3 sets out our approach and research methodology including limitations on this study and subsequent findings. Section 4 details the research findings. A survey was conducted of the industry to provide information on various aspects of its performance. Unfortunately no firms operating in the newspaper or paper sectors responded thus impacting on the representativeness of the survey. The main findings are summarised below. The vast majority of companies surveyed continue to be private Irish-owned firms. Sales performance of surveyed companies is in decline. The Industry faces competition internationally; the overwhelming majority of companies surveyed do not export. The respondents considered themselves relatively capable against Irish competitors however less competitive across nearly all areas against International competition. Particular factors in their lack of competitiveness are seen as raw material costs and access and overall relative cost position. Average employment is 20 persons, inferring a significant decline when compared to the 2005 Report. This confirmed supporting data from Forfas. On average over 55 % of employees of respondent companies are operatives or crafts people. Less than 20 % of respondent companies had vacancies compared to over half reported in 2005. Both overcapacity and low capacity usage remain features of the industry however expected lead times and time lost due to breakdowns has improved when compared to the 2005 Report. Average capacity utilisation for companies in the survey was 69 % with over a third operating at below 60 %. Over 80 % of companies surveyed indicated that they undertake benchmarking; this is a significant <b>increase</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> reported in the 2005 Report...|$|E

The results indicate that the extent of mixed ionic–electronic conductivity is a function of temperature and can be tuned by modifying the Tb- (and Co-doping) concentration. Low Tb-content materials (x ¼ 0. 1 and 0. 2) are predominant ionic conductors, but the materials with 50 mol% Tb show both p-type electronic and ionic conductivity. The enhanced electronic conduction in Ce 0. 5 Tb 0. 5 O 2 d is associated with narrowing of the band gap upon doping ceria with Tb. In addition, the surface chemistry of the samples was investigated by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and pulse isotopic exchange (PIE). The surface exchange rate is found to <b>increase</b> <b>on</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of Tb doping. The highest surface exchange rates in this study are found for materials doped with 50 mol% Tb...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{integration}} of phase change materials (PCMs) into building structures. The basic requirement is improved thermal stability during the summer season without using an air conditioner. This {{can be achieved by}} increasing the thermal storage capacity of the building structures. If the thermal capacity cannot be <b>increased</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of weight, phase change materials can be used. These materials are capable of storing latent heat and thus increasing the thermal storage capacity of the building. In the thesis the phase change materials were investigated in a thermal incubator by thermal analysis and, above all, in full-scale experiments using comparative measurements. The comparative measurements were carried out in two attic rooms at the Faculty of Civil Engineering, Brno University of Technology, where in one was used as a reference and the other for the experiment. Manufactured heat storage panels were installed in the experimental room. These panels are composed of a base plate; the capillary tubes placed on it are coated with modified plaster. The gypsum plaster is modified with micro-capsules paraffin for improving the thermal storage capacity. This system is connected to a thermal air-water pump, by which the storage panels can be additionally cooled or heated. In the experimental measurements, different operating modes were investigated and their effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> indoor environment was evaluated. Thermal storage in PCMs dampens the temperature amplitude in the building during the summer season and, at the same time, allows the stored heat to be discharged during the night. Moreover, the time interval of withdrawing electric energy from the supply mains is much shorter than in the case of air conditioning. A conventional air conditioner must operate simultaneously with the thermal load, i. e. at the time of peak consumption of electric energy. Thanks to the set regimes, the installed system is capable of responding to external thermal condi...|$|R
40|$|Severe {{drooling}} negatively affects {{many aspects}} of daily life, social interactions, {{and the development of}} self-esteem. The impact of salivary flow reduction following medication (scopolamine and intraglandular Botulinum Toxin Type A injection in <b>the</b> submandibular glands) <b>on</b> daily life and provision of care, and on social interaction and self-esteem was evaluated in 45 children with Cerebral Palsy (3 - 16 years) who suffered from severe drooling. Drooling diminished substantially and this was accompanied by a significant reduction in care needs. The amount of reported damage to communication devices and computers decreased. The reduction of drooling was also related to increased social interactions with peers. However, parents perceived that the impact of drooling had <b>increased</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of <b>the</b> child's satisfaction <b>on</b> physical appearance, relations within the extended family, and life in general. This may reflect their disappointment as the treatment effect decreased during the 24 weeks following injection, leading to a gradual increase in drooling. Unfortunately, many social and emotional consequences of drooling remained unchanged. Behavioural intervention is another option for the treatment of drooling. Although effective behavioural procedures are reported, the evidence-base of behavioural intervention in terms of number of studies and their quality is limited. The effectiveness of a self-management procedure for drooling was evaluated in a center-based case-series study (n= 10). After intervention, all participants (7; 0 - 19; 9 years) remained dry for intervals of 30 - 60 minutes while being engaged in daily activities. For all participants generalization to the classroom occurred. For three participants maintenance of treatment effect was established at 6 and 24 weeks. However, seven participants failed to maintain self-management skills at follow-up. Parental and teachers' judgment of drooling severity during the day showed positive results up to 24 weeks follow-up. Positive changes in the impact of drooling on daily care, social interactions, and self esteem were reported as well...|$|R
