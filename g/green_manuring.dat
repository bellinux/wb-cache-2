40|$|AbstractGreen manure use in China has {{declined}} rapidly since the 1980 s with the {{extensive use of}} chemical fertilizers. The deterioration of field environments {{and the demand for}} green agricultural products have resulted in more attention to <b>green</b> <b>manure.</b> Human intervention and policy-oriented behaviors likely have large impacts on promoting <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> planting. However, little information is available regarding on where, at what rates, and in which ways (i. e., intercropping <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> in orchards or rotating <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> in cropland) to develop <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> and what benefits could be gained by incorporating <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> in fields at the county scale. This paper presents the conversion of land use and its effects at small region extent (CLUE-S) model, which is specifically developed for the simulation of land use changes originally, to predict spatial distribution of <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> in cropland and orchards in 2020 in Pinggu District located in Beijing, China. Four types of land use for planting or not planting <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> were classified and the future land use dynamics (mainly croplands and orchards) were considered in the prediction. Two scenarios were used to predict the spatial distribution of <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> based on data from 2011 : The promotion of <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> planting in orchards (scenario 1) and the promotion of simultaneous <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> planting in orchards and croplands (scenario 2). The predictions were generally accurate based on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and Kappa indices, which validated the effectiveness of the CLUE-S model in the prediction. In addition, the spatial distribution of the <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> was acquired, which indicated that <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> mainly located in the orchards of the middle and southern regions of Dahuashan, the western and southern regions of Wangxinzhuang, the middle region of Shandongzhuang, the eastern region of Pinggu and the middle region of Xiagezhuang under scenario 1. <b>Green</b> <b>manure</b> planting under scenario 2 occurred in orchards in the middle region of Wangxinzhuang, and croplands in most regions of Daxingzhuang, southern Pinggu, northern Xiagezhuang and most of Mafang. The spatially explicit results allowed for the assessment of the benefits of these changes based on different economic and ecological indicators. The economic and ecological gains of scenarios 1 and 2 were 175 691 900 and 143 000 300 CNY, respectively, which indicated that the first scenario was more beneficial for promoting the same area of <b>green</b> <b>manure.</b> These results can facilitate policies of promoting <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> and guide the extensive use of <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> in local agricultural production in suitable ways...|$|R

The plots represented the <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> sowing days (0, 20, 40 and 60 before transplanting of lettuce), and the sub-plots were assigned by cropping systems (lettuce in sole crop and intercropped with black oat, cowpea or white lupin). Simultaneous planting in the intercropping {{did not affect the}} lettuce performance. However, when the <b>green</b> <b>manures</b> were sown before lettuce, they influenced it in a negative way. Among the <b>green</b> <b>manures,</b> cowpea increased biomass and had a higher negative effect on lettuce performance compared to white lupin, which appeared to produce less competition. The sole crop and the intercropping with simultaneous planting of the <b>green</b> <b>manures</b> resulted in a better lettuce performance...|$|R

The increases in yield of rice and wheat and the total nitrogen content in shoot and grain was also perceptible by the application of <b>green</b> <b>manuring.</b> The results highlight the importance of <b>green</b> <b>manuring</b> in rice-wheat cropping systems under tropical sandy-clay-loam soil conditions of India...|$|E
40|$|<b>Green</b> <b>manuring</b> means {{turning under}} {{suitable}} crops {{to enrich the}} soil. Such crops may be turned under green or when ripe. <b>Green</b> <b>manuring</b> adds organic matter and, directly or indirectly, nitrogen to the soil. Leguminous crops are most desirable for <b>green</b> <b>manuring,</b> since they add to the soil nitrogen gathered from the air {{in addition to the}} organic matter which they carry. Besides the nitrogen in the legumes turned under, an additional supply of nitrogen is fixed in the soil by the action of bacteria, using the carbon in the organic matter as a source of energy. Turning under an entire crop is advised only when the soil is poor and for the purpose of starting a rotation. Turning under catch crops or winter-grown green crops is an economical and successful method of supplying nitrogen. " [...] p. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{observations}} {{were conducted on}} chernozem soil in a sugar-beet production region in 1971 – 2002. Six variants of organic amendment were examined: l – straw harvest, 2 – straw harvest + <b>green</b> <b>manuring,</b> 3 – straw incorporation, 4 – straw incor-poration + <b>green</b> <b>manuring,</b> 5 – straw burning, 6 – straw burning till 1977 + intercrop, incorporation of farmyard manure at 10 t/ha since 1978. The effect of organic amendment on winter wheat continuous cropping was statistically significant. On average of the whole period (32 years), the highest yields were produced in variants with straw burning (var. 5) – 6. 04 t/ha and with <b>green</b> <b>manuring</b> (var. 2) – 6. 03 t/ha, and lower yields in variants with straw incorporation into soil (var. 3) – 5. 65 t/ha, (var. 4) – 5. 67 t/ha. The smallest differences between variants {{were found in the}} first decade of the experi-ment. Over time (in the second and third decades), the differences increased and positive effects of <b>green</b> <b>manuring</b> and straw burning and adverse effects of straw incorporation into soil increased. The yield level of winter wheat continuous cropping was high under the given conditions. The yield for the whole period of the experiment averaged 5. 85 t/ha, the yields 5. 19, 6. 54 and 5. 76 t/ha were obtained in the first, second and third decade, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The dose {{effects of}} <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> in {{vegetable}} crops production are still poorly understood. There are few scientific {{studies indicate that}} increasing the dose may influence plants characteristics. The objectives were to evaluate the effect of doses of velvet bean <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> on growth and yield, the partitioning of dry matter and nitrogen (N) in plants of broccoli, as well as determine the apparent recovery and physiological efficiency of use N. We established four treatments plus a control. The treatments consisted of four levels of green manure: 0, 3, 6, 9 t ha- 1 on a dry matter basis, {{with the addition of}} 12 t ha- 1 of compost. Doses of <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> applied influenced the growth and yield of broccoli. The distribution of dry matter between plant parts of broccoli is not influenced by the doses of <b>green</b> <b>manure.</b> Doses of <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> influenced the amount of N accumulated in the inflorescence and whole plant of broccoli. The apparent recovery of N from <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> and efficiency of N use by plants of broccoli are positively associated with the applied doses. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{incorporation}} of ecological practices into sugarcane production and management {{has the potential}} to arrest and ameliorate the negative effects of monocropping on soil degradation and yield decline. Historically, the production of <b>green</b> <b>manures</b> as cover or break crops has been shown to improve the physical, chemical, and biological properties of soil for many crops in production agriculture. This paper examines research outcomes based on the {{incorporation of}} <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> practices into sugarcane production throughout the world. Early studies conducted in South Africa revealed the benefits imparted to soil by <b>green</b> <b>manures.</b> More recent research in Australia, Louisiana, Thailand, and Swaziland has shown the use of <b>green</b> <b>manures</b> to improve soil properties and reduce the incidence of disease, with accompanying increases in sugarcane yields. Current investigations conducted by the Joint Yield Decline Venture in Australia indicate that the use of <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> break crops and rotations can result in significant yield increases as a function of improved soil properties. Field and laboratory studies with <b>green</b> <b>manures</b> are currently underway in South Africa to develop strategies for improving soil sustainability and sugarcane yields...|$|R
