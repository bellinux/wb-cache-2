5|$|Possibly as {{a result}} of Eystein's activities, King David granted half of Caithness to Harald's cousin, Erlend Haraldsson. The result, as recounted in the Orkneyinga Saga, was a {{political}} struggle which ended with Erlend's murder in 1154. Rognvald too was killed, in 1158. Svein Asleifsson was again heavily involved in this dynastic conflict. In 1153 King David died, to be succeeded by his young grandson, Malcolm IV. King Eystein too died in a war with his brothers Ingi and Sigurd which left Ingi the sole surviving son of Harald Gilli. As a result, by 1158 Harald Maddadsson was undisputed Earl of Orkney, with neither the King of Scots nor the King of Norway <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>position</b> to contest his power.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} distinctions is that no negative score is assigned in the scoring system of the Smith–Waterman algorithm, which enables local alignment. When any element has a score lower than zero, it means that the sequences up to this position have no similarities; this element will then be set to zero to eliminate influence from previous alignment. In this way, calculation can continue to find alignment <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>position</b> afterwards.|$|E
25|$|Leslie Harry Compton (12 September 1912 – 27 December 1984) was an English sportsman {{who played}} {{football}} and cricket for Arsenal and Middlesex, respectively.

25|$|Meireles {{could play}} <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>position</b> in the midfield, but {{preferred}} {{to operate as}} a central midfielder. He was capable of being deployed in both a defensive and attacking role, depending on the players available and coaches' strategies. At Porto, he was used initially as a defensive midfielder, but tactical factors saw him swift to attacking midfielder; in an opposite approach, when Paulo Bento was appointed as the Portuguese head coach in 2010, the player was eventually played in a more defensive position after starting out in attacking midfield.|$|E

Iniesta played {{for the first time as}} a left wing-forward for Barça in two Champions League matches against Levski Sofia, finding the net twice. In the first knockout stage of the same competition, he played in central midfield against Liverpool.

He sought the nomination at the Whig convention to run to keep his seat, but his lack of political experience led to his defeat.

25|$|By 1989, {{there were}} 529 {{concrete}} towers {{along the length}} of the inner German border and a further 155 towers of steel and wood construction, as well as various little-used observation platforms in trees. The concrete towers were prefabricated from sections that could be assembled within a few days. Their height could be varied by reducing the number of sections as required. They were connected to an electricity supply and telephone line and were equipped with a powerful 1,000-watt searchlight (Suchscheinwerfer) on the roof that could be directed at targets <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>position</b> around the watchtower. The windows could be opened to enable the guards to open fire without leaving the tower. In addition, the towers had firing ports emplaced in the side walls below the guard compartment.|$|E
25|$|The Eóganachta {{achieved}} {{their status}} primarily through {{political and economic}} sophistication and not military conquest. Ireland was dominated by several hostile powers whom they were never <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>position</b> to challenge militarily on their own, in the early centuries, but there also existed a number of subject tribes whom the Deirgtine successfully convinced to adopt them as their overlords. The effect was to separate the Dáirine, by now mainly the Corcu Loígde, from their cousin kingdoms and prominent subjects. The Eóganachta progressively surrounded themselves with favoured vassals such as the Múscraige, who would become {{the main source of}} their income as well as defense against the other kingdoms. The later famous Déisi Tuisceart, who would produce Brian Bóruma, were among these vassal peoples. The Déisi Muman of County Waterford may have shared Gaulish origins with the Eóganachta themselves.|$|E

25|$|Queensland's Don Tallon was {{reaching}} {{the end of}} his career, but despite his poor performances managed to hold his place against his rivals Gil Langley and Ron Saggers even though he had missed the tour South Africa in 1949-50. He took only 8 catches in the 5 Test series, missed every stumping chance and only satisfied his critics in the Third Test at Sydney. Otherwise the Australians were usually far superior to the England side in the field - the 1953 Australians were considered to be the best fielding team ever to tour England - and they trained hard to improve their performance. Neil Harvey was an outstanding in the covers, Ian Johnson was considered {{to be one of the}} best slip fielders in the world and Keith Miller and Sam Loxton were good catchers of the ball <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} notion in CGT {{is that of}} the solved game. For example, tic-tac-toe {{is considered}} a solved game, as it can be proven that any game will result in a draw if both players play optimally. Deriving similar results for games with rich combinatorial structures is difficult. For instance, in 2007 it was announced that checkers has been weakly solvedoptimal play by both sides also leads to a drawbut this result was a computer-assisted proof. Other real world games are mostly too complicated to allow complete analysis today, although the theory has had some recent successes in analyzing Go endgames. Applying CGT to a position attempts to determine the optimum sequence of moves for both players until the game ends, and by doing so discover the optimum move <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>position.</b> In practice, this process is torturously difficult unless the game is very simple.|$|E
