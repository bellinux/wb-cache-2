2500|$|This debate {{demonstrated}} the profound differences which, from then on, separated Bettelheim from Marxist [...] "orthodoxy", which considered Socialism {{as the result}} of [...] "the development of maximum centralization of all forces of industrial production". For Bettelheim, socialism is rather an alternative voice in development; a process of transformation of social understandings. Inspired by the Chinese Cultural Revolution and the thought of Mao Zedong, and in cooperation with the Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser, Bettelheim was opposed to [...] "economism" [...] and to the [...] "primacy of the means of production" [...] of traditional Marxism: against the idea that socialist transformation of social bonds was a necessary effect of the development of the forces of production (liberating those bonds from them, according to Marxist orthodoxy, since private property dominates them in [...] "bourgeois" [...] society), he affirmed the necessity for actively and politically transforming social connections. In his book <b>Economic</b> <b>Calculations</b> and Forms of Ownership (Calcul économique et formes de proprieté), Bettelheim re-thinks the problems of transition to socialism, while criticizing the supposition that nationalization and state ownership of the means of production was already [...] "socialist"—it is not the legal form of property, but true socialization of the web of production, which characterizes such a transition the crucial problem in socialist planning is the replacement of the form of [...] "value" [...] with the development of a method of measurement which takes into account the social utility of production.|$|E

A little more optimistically, philosopher John Leslie assigns a 70% chance of humanity surviving the next five centuries, based partly on the controversial philosophical doomsday argument that Leslie champions.

After World War II, and the Allied ban on aircraft production in Germany until the late 1950s, Claude diversified the company's production and also encouraged his son Claudius to find new areas. As a result, Claudius designed and developed a four-seater car, where the two front and two rear passengers sat back to back, to optimally use the enclosed space. A prototype was built and tested, which was named Dornier Delta. However, the company had never built a car before, and <b>economic</b> <b>calculations</b> showed that the volume of sales required would not make it economical for the company to make the car, using its existing facilities.|$|E
50|$|Ludwig von Mises {{argued that}} a socialist system based upon a planned economy {{would not be able}} to {{allocate}} resources effectively due to the lack of price signals.

His argument was that socialism must fail economically because of the economic calculation problemthe impossibility of a socialist government being able to make the <b>economic</b> <b>calculations</b> required to organize a complex economy. Mises projected that without a market economy there would be no functional price system, which he held essential for achieving rational and efficient allocation of capital goods to their most productive uses.

40|$|Abstract The Austrian {{calculation}} argument {{suggests that}} inability {{to engage in}} <b>economic</b> <b>calculation</b> worsened outcomes in socialist states. We suggest that this is hardly the case. When Austrian assumptions of benevolence are relaxed, inability to engage in <b>economic</b> <b>calculation</b> prevents the non-benevolent planner from fully extracting all available surplus from the citizenry. Consequently, when planners are non-benevolent, calculation ceases to be a relevant argument against the desirability of central planning; its normative force reverses absent benevolent planners...|$|R

An important method of <b>economic</b> <b>calculation</b> - particularly in the post-Stalin period - was that of incrementalism. Input norms were a very important method of both inter-industry and consumption planning. Material balances, and later input-output, were also widely used.
