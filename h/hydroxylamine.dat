5|$|Many other binary {{nitrogen}} hydrides are known, but {{the most}} important are hydrazine (N2H4) and hydrogen azide (HN3). Although it is not a nitrogen hydride, <b>hydroxylamine</b> (NH2OH) is similar in properties and structure to ammonia and hydrazine as well. Hydrazine is a fuming, colourless liquid that smells similarly to ammonia. Its physical properties are very similar to those of water (melting point 2.0°C, boiling point 113.5°C, density 1.00g·cm−3). Despite it being an endothermic compound, it is kinetically stable. It burns quickly and completely in air very exothermically to give nitrogen and water vapour. It is a very useful and versatile reducing agent and is a weaker base than ammonia. It is also commonly used as a rocket fuel.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hydroxylamine</b> is an {{inorganic}} compound with the formula NH2OH. The pure material is a white, unstable crystalline, hygroscopic compound. However, <b>hydroxylamine</b> {{is almost always}} provided and used as an aqueous solution. It is used to prepare oximes, an important functional group. It is also an intermediate in biological nitrification. In biological nitrification, the oxidation of NH3 to <b>hydroxylamine</b> is mediated by the enzyme ammonia monooxygenase (AMO). <b>Hydroxylamine</b> oxidoreductase (HAO) further oxidizes <b>hydroxylamine</b> to nitrite.|$|E
25|$|Nitro {{compounds}} may {{be reduced}} to either the <b>hydroxylamine</b> or amine oxidation level with samarium iodide, depending on the conditions employed. Electron transfer, followed by proton transfer and elimination generates an intermediate nitroso compound, which undergoes two more rounds of electron transfer and protonation to afford the <b>hydroxylamine.</b> Further reduction of the <b>hydroxylamine</b> leads to the amine.|$|E
50|$|Nitrones are {{generated}} most often {{either by the}} oxidation of <b>hydroxylamines</b> or condensation of monosubstituted <b>hydroxylamines</b> with carbonyl compounds (ketones or aldehydes). The most general reagent used for the oxidation of <b>hydroxylamines</b> is mercury(II) oxide.Carbonyl condensation methods avoid issues of site selectivity associated with the oxidation of <b>hydroxylamines</b> with two sets of (alpha) hydrogens.A significant problem associated with many reactive nitrones is dimerization. This issue is alleviated experimentally by employing an excess of the nitrone or increasing the reaction temperature to exaggerate entropic factors.|$|R

40|$|International audienceNew chiral nitroxides {{based on}} the imidazolidin- 4 -one skeleton, and the {{corresponding}} <b>hydroxylamines,</b> have been prepared from cyclic nitrones by a straightforward reaction sequence.

Both the imidazolidinone nitroxides and <b>hydroxylamines</b> were proven to catalyze the reaction, with the ring substituent having an effect depending on the co-catalytic system. In some cases, rapid oxidation to benzaldehyde was accomplished at room temperature under an atmospheric O 2 pressure. Moreover, atroposelective desymmetrization was achieved during the aerobic oxidation of a diol catalyzed by an enantiopure imidazolidinone nitroxide.

25|$|Under {{strongly}} basic conditions, the deprotonated substrate {{reacts with}} the N-oxyammonium species. Attack of the substrate alkoxide on either nitrogen or oxygen may occur, although {{the former is}} believed to operate {{on the basis of}} on observations of oxidations of N-alkoxy amines (which, presumably, proceed via intermediate 1). Comproportionation of the reduced product (a <b>hydroxylamine)</b> with the oxoammonium ion competes with oxidation; thus, an excess of the oxidizing agent is often required.|$|E
25|$|Copper(II), both as {{the free}} {{chloride}} salt {{and as a}} complex with bidentate ligands, oxidizes TEMPO to its oxoammonium salt. In these reactions, air serves as the terminal oxidant. It is unclear whether air oxidizes copper(I) to copper(II), or whether alcohol oxidation is partially mediated by copper and air oxidizes the resulting <b>hydroxylamine</b> back to the oxoammonium salt. The former occurs during the Wacker process, but the latter explains why copper complexes {{and a few other}} metal complexes are able to oxidize alcohols in conjunction with TEMPO.|$|E

25|$|This {{has also}} {{been used in the}} past by {{biologists}} to introduce random mutations by switching base pairs from G to A, or from C to T. This is to probe functional areas of genes to elucidate what happens if their functions are broken. Nowadays other mutagens are used. <b>Hydroxylamine</b> {{can also be used to}} highly selectively cleave asparaginyl-glycine peptide bonds in peptides and proteins. It also bonds to and permanently disables (poisons) heme-containing enzymes. It is used as an irreversible inhibitor of the oxygen-evolving complex of photosynthesis on account of its similar structure to water.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} {{limitation of}} both of the above methods is incompatibility with free amine or alkene functionality, both of which undergo competitive oxidation. The use of bis(acetoxy)iodobenzene (BAIB) as the terminal oxidant avoids this problem. BAIB is unable to oxidize the nitroxide radical directly, and initial formation of oxoammonium {{is believed to be}} due to acid-catalyzed disproportionation. BAIB may then oxidize the resulting <b>hydroxylamine</b> to an oxoammonium salt. Although the reaction is conducted under acidic conditions (acetic acid is a byproduct, and is often added to facilitate disproportionation), selectivity for primary alcohol oxidation is substantial. Base-sensitive functional groups, such as epoxides, are tolerated under these conditions.|$|E
25|$|In alkylimino-de-oxo-bisubstitution, {{a primary}} or {{secondary}} amine {{adds to the}} carbonyl group and a proton is transferred from the nitrogen to the oxygen atom to create a carbinolamine.

After the elimination of water, this will result in an oxime. An ammonia derivative of the form H2NNR2 such as hydrazine (H2NNH2) or 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine can also be the nucleophile and after the elimination of water, resulting in the formation of a hydrazone, which are usually orange crystalline solids. This reaction forms the basis of a test for aldehydes and ketones.|$|E

40|$|A novel nanohybrid was {{assembled}} by a layer-by-layer strategy that permitted the immobilization of nickel(II) hydroxide on multi-walled carbon nanotubes. The heterogeneous catalyst {{was used for}} the reduction of a wide variety nitroaromatics to <b>hydroxylamines</b> in a binary solvent mixture (tetrahydrofuran/water), in the presence of sodium borohydride and under mild conditions. The reaction is highly selective as it afforded cleanly the expected aromatic <b>hydroxylamines</b> in the presence of other sensitive groups such as halogens, esters, double bonds or nitriles. The catalyst could also be readily recycled by a simple centrifugation and reused in subsequent reduction reactions with no decrease in catalytic activities, over five cycles. Analysis of the spent catalyst indicated neither alteration in the morphology, metal-content, nor oxidation state of the carbon nanotube-supported nickel(II). The catalytic nanohybrid assembly reported in this work thus compares favorably with known systems, as it is very stable, operates at room temperature with limited nickel loading (0. 8 mol%), and selectively leads to N-aryl <b>hydroxylamines</b> without the formation of the corresponding anilines...|$|R
