As a result of his early training he was the first one to see the wakes of the two torpedoes coming from the port side. Both torpedoes went between the Helena and the San Francisco and when both ships turned, the torpedoes went past us and one of them hit the Juneau. We were not able to warn the Juneau in time to save her.|$|E
500|$|Because Johnston was {{believed}} to be safe at the ColdwaterII observation post, the fact that he died shocked his friends and co-workers alike. However, most of his colleagues and family asserted that Johnston died [...] "doing what he wanted to do." [...] His mother stated in an interview shortly after the eruption, [...] "Not many people get to do what they really want to do in this world, but our son did.... He would tell us he may never get rich but he was doing what he wanted. He wanted to be near if the eruption came. In a phone call on Mother's Day, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> it's a sight very few geologists get to see." [...] Dr. Stephen Malone agreed that Johnston died doing what he loved, and stated that he [...] "was very good at his work".|$|E
500|$|Maeser had a {{profound}} effect on his students. One of them, Alice Louise Reynolds, wrote that [...] "he had the ability to inspire. He made his students feel the worth of life; <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that the Lord had sent each of us to do a special work, and that the proper preparation was necessary for that mission." [...] Among the students who studied under Maeser were George Sutherland, William H. King, Bryant S. Hinckley, James E. Talmage, George Albert Smith and J. Golden Kimball. He also inspired his family members; one of his sons, Karl Emil, studied under Maeser and went on to be a respected educator and school president. Maeser retired from Brigham Young Academy in 1892 to devote his time to his position as the Superintendent of Church Schools. He was succeeded by Benjamin Cluff.|$|E

500|$|After {{the episode}} aired, in the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] {{featurette}} released by HBO for [...] "The Door", David Benioff and D. B. Weiss {{revealed that the}} closing scene involving Hodor's name origin and subsequent death was an idea that was presented to them directly from George R. R. Martin. Benioff stated, [...] "We had this meeting with George Martin where we're trying {{to get as much}} information as possible out of him, and probably the most shocking revelation he had for us was when <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> the origin of Hodor and how that name came about. I just remember Dan and I looking at each other when he said that and just being like, 'Holy shit.'" [...] Weiss continued, [...] "It {{was just one of the}} saddest and most affecting things. Even sitting in a hotel room having someone tell you this was going to happen in the abstract in some way and that 'hold the door' was the origin of the name Hodor, we just thought that was a really, really heart-breaking idea." ...|$|E
500|$|Kilburn twice {{accompanied}} the England team on overseas tours to Australia: in 1946–47 and 1954–55. During the former tour, {{he became a}} founder member of the Cricket Writers' Club. He served as its secretary, chairman and later became an Honorary Life Member. He also became the only journalist elected as a life member at Yorkshire, and opened the newly built press box at Headingley Cricket Ground in 1988. In his final years, he became blind—his sight began to fail shortly after his retirement— but according to Wisden, [...] "Jim Kilburn remained an upright, dignified man until he died". Outside of his work, Kilburn played golf to a reasonable standard, and was married with three children. Derek Hodgson writes: [...] "All his work will be valued as an accurate insight into social attitudes {{in the first half}} of this century. Jim Kilburn intended always to write about cricket but in fact <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> all so much more." [...] He wrote ten books on cricket, and contributed regularly to The Cricketer magazine and to Wisden.|$|E
500|$|Lasseter also {{explained}} that the film started with pencil and paper designs, saying: [...] "Truth to materials. Starting with pencil-and-paper designs from production designer Bob Pauley, and continuing through the modeling, articulation, and shading of the characters, and finally into animation, the production team worked hard to have the car characters remain true to their origins." [...] Character department manager Jay Ward also explained how they wanted the cars to look as realistic as possible, saying: [...] "John didn't want the cars to seem clay-like or mushy. He insisted on truth to materials. This was a huge thing for him. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that steel needs to feel like steel. Glass should feel like glass. These cars need to feel heavy. They weigh three or four thousand pounds. When they move around, {{they need to have}} that feel. They shouldn't appear light or overly bouncy {{to the point where the}} audience might see them as rubber toys." [...] According to directing animator James Ford Murphy, [...] "Originally, the car models were built so they could basically do anything. John kept reminding us that these characters are made of metal and they weigh several thousand pounds. They can't stretch. He showed us examples of very loose animation to illustrate what not to do." ...|$|E

500|$|Oliphant then {{met with}} the Uranium Committee. Samuel K. Allison, a new member of the Committee, was a talented {{experimental}} physicist and a protégé of Arthur Compton at the University of Chicago. Oliphant [...] "came to a meeting", Allison recalls, [...] "and said 'bomb' in no uncertain terms. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> we must concentrate every effort on the bomb, and said we {{had no right to}} work on power plants or anything but the bomb. The bomb would cost 25 million dollars, he said, and Britain did not have the money or the manpower, so it was up to us." [...] Allison was surprised that Briggs had kept the committee in the dark. Oliphant visited his friend Ernest Lawrence, and also spoke with James Conant and Enrico Fermi. He not only managed to convince the Americans that an atomic bomb was feasible, but also inspired Lawrence to convert his [...] cyclotron into a giant mass spectrometer for isotope separation, a technique Oliphant had pioneered in 1934. Leo Szilard later wrote, [...] "if Congress knew the true history of the atomic energy project, I have no doubt but that it would create a special medal to be given to meddling foreigners for distinguished services, and that Dr Oliphant {{would be the first to}} receive one." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following the {{completion}} of the campaign in Poland the armoured forces were transferred to the west to prepare for the next set of operations. The four light divisions had proved to have inadequate firepower, and they were brought up to strength to full panzer divisions, one of which was given to Erwin Rommel. With this change the total number of panzer divisions in the Heer stood at ten. Guderian continued to work in development of the panzer arm. Said Hans von Luck of the 7th Panzer Division in his memoir: [...] "In the middle of February we were transferred to Dernau on the Ahr, hence practically in to the western front. Rommel visited every unit. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that he was proud to be permitted to lead a panzer division. Guderian too came to inspect and talk to us. 'You are the cavalry' <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us.</b> 'Your job is to break through and keep going.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{unidentified}} {{source said}} interrogations with Roof {{after his arrest}} determined he had been planning the attack for around six months, researched Emanuel AME Church, and targeted it because of its role in African-American history.

But I think he couldn't get into the school because of the security ... so I think he just settled for the church." ...|$|E

In {{one of the eight}} recordings revealed, Olmert can also be heard talking about buying Sheldon Adelson's, a Jewish-American billionaire's, testimony, and how <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>U.S.</b> President George W.

2500|$|In May 1996 the Israeli weekly {{newspaper}} Kol Ha'ir published the personal accounts of {{several members of}} the Israeli artillery battery responsible for the shelling of the Qana camp. The soldiers spoke under condition of anonymity. One acknowledged that they were encouraged by their commander after the attack: [...] "He told us it was war. Come on, the bastards fire at you, what can you do? <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> we were firing well and we should keep it up, and that Arabs, you know there are millions of them," [...] Soldier A was quoted as saying. Another artilleryman, Soldier T, was quoted as saying that [...] "no-one spoke about it {{as if it was a}} mistake. We did our job and we are at peace with that. Even 'S' told us we were great and that they were just a bunch of Arabs (in Hebrew, 'arabushim')...How many Arabs are there and how many Jews? A few 'arabushim' die, there is no harm in that."

Oliphant then visited his friend Ernest Lawrence to explain the urgency. Lawrence contacted Compton and James B. Conant, who received the final MAUD Report from Thomson on 3 October 1941. Urey and Pegram were sent to the UK to obtain more information. In January 1942, the OSRD was empowered to engage in large engineering projects in addition to research. Without the help of the MAUD Committee the Manhattan Project would have started months behind. Instead they were able to begin thinking about how to create a bomb, not whether it was possible.
