5|$|Belgian comics artist Willy Vandersteen {{created his}} own version of the TV show with a collie named Bessy in 1954.

5|$|Fox Mulder's {{abduction}} was {{devised by}} Chris Carter {{towards the end}} of seventh season as a way of allowing the actor to leave the series.

5|$|Gaga was {{scheduled}} to begin The Monster Ball Tour in March 2010, but following the cancellation of Fame Kills, The Monster Ball Tour began in November 2009.

5|$|In a deleted scene set {{after the}} end of the episode, Walter talks with the first patient Joseph Slater, who wonders why he was chosen to have a piece of Walter's brain. Walter {{responds}} it was a matter of circumstance, as Slater shared his blood type and had a young resilient brain. Walter also says he himself cannot be cured, as his madness had nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> missing parts of his brain.|$|E

5|$|Parker and Stone {{were very}} happy with the episode, but {{received}} feedback from fans {{that it was one of}} the weaker episodes of the first season, and that the constant jokes about Barbra Streisand started to grow redundant. Many fans also did not like Kenny's tether ball accident death scene because it had nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> plot of the episode, which Parker and Stone said was supposed to be the joke.|$|E
5|$|The Christ myth {{theory is}} the {{hypothesis}} that Jesus of Nazareth never existed; or if he did, that he had virtually nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> founding of Christianity and the accounts in the gospels. Stories of Jesus' birth, along with other key events, have so many mythic elements that some scholars have suggested that Jesus himself was a myth.|$|E
5|$|The Residences at the Ritz-Carlton {{stands on}} the former site of the 38-story One Meridian Plaza. In February 1991 One Meridian Plaza was badly damaged by a fire that {{destroyed}} eight floors and killed three firefighters.

5|$|The {{excavators}} {{found an}} iron object under the skeleton's vertebrae and speculated {{it might be}} an arrowhead {{that had been embedded}} in its back.

5|$|There's {{something}} special about that first single, we were never quite able to recapture that sound. I don't {{know if it was}} the guitars or the recording. It was just a really gnarly, gnarly guitar sound. We've gotten some since, but they've been a different kind. I think it had more to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> actual electromagnetic chemistry of what was going through our amps that day. It was just a cool, fried-out sound.|$|E
5|$|Throughout history, {{mothers have}} been portrayed {{as the primary}} {{physical}} caregivers of children. Physical caregiving includes tasks such as breast-feeding and changing diapers. Some theorize that this has to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> idea of women as having a natural instinct towards motherhood. Fathers, on the other hand, have been {{more likely to be}} portrayed in play activities with their children and are often more likely to be shown interacting with sons than daughters.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} Oslo Airport {{location}} controversy, {{after the}} new airport was decided located to Gardermoen, there was a public discussion {{as to what to}} <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> general aviation which had operated from Fornebu. While some local aircraft owners wanted to keep a small part of Fornebu for general aviation, the authorities decided to close the airport completely. Instead, the general aviation was distributed to various private airports in Eastern Norway, including Notodden. In May 1998, Air Team started flights from Notodden to Bergen. Air Team gradually moved all its operations, including its pilot school, to Notodden. After Fornebu was closed in October, the airline experienced a quadrupling of patronage, as Gardermoen had given longer travel time for people in Buskerud and Telemark. In addition to business travel, the airline catered offshore workers commuting to the North Sea via Bergen. The airline stated that it intended to also open routes to Stavanger and Copenhagen.|$|E
5|$|At the time, the EC {{viewed the}} {{agreement}} {{as a method}} of defusing the crisis and failed to attribute the lull which coincided with the Brioni Agreement to a shift in Serbian strategy instead. The EC delegation's failure to respond to Jović's departure before the plenary meeting and the EC foreign ministers' declaration of 10 July indicating the EC would withdraw from mediation if the Brioni Agreement was not implemented only encouraged Serbia which, unlike Slovenia, Croatia, or the Yugoslav federation, had nothing to lose if the EC pulled out. In the end, the EC took credit for a rapid resolution of the armed conflict in Slovenia without realising that its diplomatic efforts had little to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> situation on the ground.|$|E

5|$|By 1907, new {{university}} buildings completely {{surrounded the}} observatory; {{dust from the}} construction clogged meteorological instruments, and at night electric lighting made astronomical work impossible. The Meteorological Office decided to abandon the site and {{move to a new}} building {{at the north end of}} campus on Bloor Street, trading the original Observatory to the University in exchange for the new parcel of land. There was some discussion regarding what to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Cooke telescope, since the Meteorological Office had little use for this purely astronomical instrument. No other use was immediately forthcoming, and the telescope moved along with the Meteorological Office to their new Bloor Street Observatory.|$|E
