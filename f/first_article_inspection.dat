40|$|In {{the last}} years, {{industrial}} computed tomography (CT) in Switzerland had its main application in scientific examinations. Specific fields of interest were flaw detection, analysis of failure, dimensional measurements of not accessible geometrical features, inspection of assemblies or statistical investigations of material properties as density distribution.

40|$|Volltext) Rapid {{technologies}} have {{grown into a}} major component in the product development process chain {{in a wide variety}} of fields in Germany. The time and money saved using technologies such as rapid prototyping, rapid tooling, and rapid manufacturing is very powerful during the product development process. Also, modern industry is concerned with spare part production and low-volume manufacturing. These days, a widespread network of service providers is established and is continually growing to satisfy the needs and requests of its customers. The Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing and Automation (FhG-IPA) in Stuttgart, Germany established a user group in 1996. At first, the aim of this group was to describe the different RP technologies and to show how these innovative processes fit into the existing process chains of member companies. Today, the user group is building a platform for communication and information exchange for industrial companies. The group shares new ideas and discusses potential future problems for the technology. The coordination, FhG-IPA, communicates new international trends to the companies. The number of companies has increased form six at the beginning to 10 today. The European Intelligent Manufacturing Systems Rapid Product Development (IMS RPD 2001) project, coordinated by FhG-IPA, began in 2001 as a follow-up project of the successful IMS RPD project. The consortium consists of six industrial and four academic partners from six different European countries. The proposed length of the project is three years. It is focused on the aspects of development environment. The second topic is the implementation of hybrid prototyping into existing product development process chains. One major goal is to provide software tools (i. e., interfaces) for the communication between physical and virtual prototypes. Another goal is to implement automation into reverse engineering applications. The project will also result in new processes in low-volume manufacturing and new and more competitive methods to manufacture tools (for injection molding, die casting, sheet-metal forming, etc.) to reduce lead times and costs. In the past few years, computer-assisted product design and engineering technologies such as 3 D CAD modeling, reverse engineering, rapid prototyping, rapid tooling, finite element modeling, simulation tools, etc., have been developed to reduce time to market for new industrial and consumer products. Applying these technologies, several physical parts (design models, different kind of prototypess, <b>first</b> <b>article</b> parts, etc.) need to be scanned during the product development process to generate the required virtual data. Therefore, metrology techniques for volumetric data acquisition have become increasingly important. Furthermore, to improve the quality, reliability, and safety of new products, powerful non-destructive testing devices are required for a fast analysis at any step of the product development process. Commonly available data acquisition technologies, such as tactile, optical, and destructive, are limited. Industrial computed tomography (CT) is the only non-destructive technique that is able to generate volumetric information, including material properties of parts of any complexity containing inner structures. At FhG-IPA, several projects have been launched to push CT technology and to prepare the technology for integration into industry`s process chains. One of these projects iss the European <b>First</b> <b>Article</b> Tomography <b>Inspection</b> Methodology Advancement (FATIMA) project, coordinated by FhG-IPA. The project ended in January 2003, although a follow-up project is planned. The Fraunhofer Alliance, a consortium of 12 Fraunhofer institutes and industrial partners, organized the sixth uRapid conference in Frankfurt in 2002. The Alliance was also present at EuroMold 2002 in Frankfurt. Another highlight of EuroMold was the international conference "Worldwide Advances in Rapid and High-Performance Tooling, " with participation by the Global Alliance of Rapid Prototyping Associations (GARPA).

40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{requirements}} of industrial applications relating to image processing have significantly increased. According to fast and modern production processes and optimized manufacturing of high quality products, new ways of image acquisition and analysis are needed. Here the industrial computer tomography (CT) as a non-destructive technology for 3 D data generation meets this challenge by offering the possibility of complete inspection of complex industrial parts with all outer and inner geometric features. Consequently CT technology is well suited for different kinds of industrial image-based applications {{in the field of}} quality assurance like material testing or <b>first</b> <b>article</b> <b>inspection.</b> Moreover surface reconstruction and reverse engineering applications will benefit from CT. In this paper our new methods for efficient 3 D CT-image processing are presented.

However, the aspect of accuracy is essential in the field of metrology. In order to enhance precision the CT sensor can be combined with other, more accurate sensor systems generating measure points for CT data correction.

40|$|As of the {{definition}} presented by Harashima, Tomizuka, and Fukada in 1996, the mechatronics is the synergistic combination of precision mechanical engineering, electronic control and systems thinking {{in the design of}} products and manufacturing processes. The most of the mechatronic devices need the precise dimensions of the plastic parts, as long as the combination of those parts leads to a final haptic characteristic defined within specific limits or when the certain travel way is linked with an electrical contact. The increasing of the risks to produce bad mechatronic devices are directly related to the combination of the plastic injectionmolded parts out of different cavities. The paper’s aim is to present reducing of the risks to have bad final parts assembled with the components out of plastic injection-molded parts by using optical 3 D measuring techniques at first validation of the parts out of the tool and setting parameters in the injection machines. The shrinkage and the warpage are more easily detected in that way and this will support <b>first</b> <b>article</b> <b>inspection,</b> but also during the entire production process. A case study presents the analysis of the data coming from the measurements of the plastic parts from each cavity and the combination of those parts, by using the ATOS inspection software.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade Computer Tomography (CT) has become a well {{recognized}} tool in industrial use. Today CT enables engineers {{from all kinds of}} industries to inspect objects from the smallest to the largest scale ranging from electronic devices up to complete car engines. The fast development of CT and its applications was further accelerated over the past 3 years due to the use of CT in metrology. Today CT has entered a market which so far was reserved for classical coordinate measurement devices. With this additional capability being accepted by the industries CT has become a universal inspection tool. With a single scan a CT user is able to check internal and external geometries as well as all kinds of material related aspects such as porosity or fibre orientation. Therefore CT allows a complete <b>first</b> <b>article</b> <b>inspection</b> using a single scan. Volume Graphics is the pioneer in industrial CT data analysis software with more than 10 years of experience in the market. This presentation will introduce the latest generation of visualization and analysis software tool – VGStudio MAX 2. 0 – enabling the CT user to process data sets larger than 32 GB in size on modern PC hardware. The software allows the user to process CT data sets with high precision within a single software environment. Tools are available for tasks such as porosity analysis, to check wall-thicknesses, to compare the actual part against the nominal CAD model and to measure individual geometries. All data analysis processes can even be automated so that fast and efficient series inspection scenarios can be realized. The presentation will introduce the latest data analysis and automation concepts implemented in the software making CT a universal inspection tool.

These materials are classed as difficult to machine under normal circumstances, but when added to the changes in mechanical properties which occur naturally from part to part, consequently variable and often unpredictable tool life, and the ever present possibility of random and unexpected process anomalies, machining processes can never be fully optimised.
