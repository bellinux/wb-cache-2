5|$|This highly {{hypothetical}} {{picture of}} the <b>flux</b> <b>tube</b> exchange was partly confirmed by the Galileo spacecraft, which detected regions of sharply reduced plasma density and increased field strength in the inner magnetosphere. These voids may correspond to the almost empty flux tubes arriving from the outer magnetosphere. In the middle magnetosphere, Galileo detected so-called injection events, which occur when hot plasma from the outer magnetosphere impacts the magnetodisk, leading to increased flux of energetic particles and a strengthened magnetic field. No mechanism is yet known to explain the transport of cold plasma outward.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{magnetic}} field lines, which Io crosses, couple Io's atmosphere and neutral cloud to Jupiter's polar upper atmosphere by generating an electric current {{known as the}} Io <b>flux</b> <b>tube.</b> This current produces an auroral glow in Jupiter's polar regions known as the Io footprint, as well as aurorae in Io's atmosphere. Particles from this auroral interaction darken the Jovian polar regions at visible wavelengths. The location of Io and its auroral footprint with respect to Earth and Jupiter has a strong influence on Jovian radio emissions from our vantage point: when Io is visible, radio signals from Jupiter increase considerably. The Juno mission, currently in orbit around Jupiter, should help {{to shed light on}} these processes. The Jovian {{magnetic field}} lines that do get past Io's ionosphere also induce an electric current, which in turn creates an induced magnetic field within Io's interior. Io's induced magnetic field is thought to be generated within a partially molten, silicate magma ocean 50 kilometers beneath Io's surface. Similar induced fields were found at the other Galilean satellites by Galileo, generated within liquid water oceans in the interiors of those moons.|$|E
25|$|Some {{condensed}} matter systems {{propose a}} structure superficially {{similar to a}} magnetic monopole, known as a <b>flux</b> <b>tube.</b> The ends of a <b>flux</b> <b>tube</b> form a magnetic dipole, but since they move independently, they can be treated for many purposes as independent magnetic monopole quasiparticles. Since 2009, numerous news reports from the popular media have incorrectly described these systems as the long-awaited discovery of the magnetic monopoles, but the two phenomena are only superficially related to one another.|$|E

500|$|Io has an {{extremely}} thin atmosphere consisting mainly {{of sulfur dioxide}} (...) , with minor constituents including sulfur monoxide (...) , sodium chloride (...) , and atomic sulfur and oxygen. The atmosphere has significant variations in density and temperature with time of day, latitude, volcanic activity, and surface frost abundance. The maximum atmospheric pressure on Io ranges from 3.3 to 3 pascals (Pa) or 0.3 to 3 nbar, spatially seen on Io's anti-Jupiter hemisphere and along the equator, and temporally {{in the early afternoon}} when the temperature of surface frost peaks. Localized peaks at volcanic plumes have also been seen, with pressures of 5 to 40  Pa (5 to 40 nbar). Io's atmospheric pressure is lowest on Io's night side, where the pressure dips to 0.1 to 1 Pa (0.0001 to 0.001 nbar). Io's atmospheric temperature ranges from the temperature of the surface at low altitudes, where sulfur dioxide is in vapor pressure equilibrium with frost on the surface, to 1800 K at higher altitudes where the lower atmospheric density permits heating from plasma in the Io plasma torus and from Joule heating from the Io <b>flux</b> <b>tube.</b> The low pressure limits the atmosphere's effect on the surface, except for temporarily redistributing sulfur dioxide from frost-rich to frost-poor areas, and to expand the size of plume deposit rings when plume material re-enters the thicker dayside atmosphere. The thin Ionian atmosphere also means any future landing probes sent to investigate Io will not need to be encased in an aeroshell-style heatshield, but instead require retrothrusters for a soft landing. The thin atmosphere also necessitates a rugged lander capable of enduring the strong Jovian radiation, which a thicker atmosphere would attenuate.|$|E
2500|$|Since gluons {{themselves}} carry color charge, {{they participate}} in strong interactions. These gluon-gluon interactions constrain color fields to string-like objects called [...] "flux tubes", which exert constant force when stretched. Due to this force, quarks are confined within composite particles called hadrons. This effectively limits {{the range of the}} strong interaction to [...] meters, roughly the size of an atomic nucleus. Beyond a certain distance, the energy of the <b>flux</b> <b>tube</b> binding two quarks increases linearly. At a large enough distance, it becomes energetically more favorable to pull a quark-antiquark pair out of the vacuum rather than increase the length of the <b>flux</b> <b>tube.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On March 5, 1979, Voyager1 {{performed}} the closest encounter with Io of the Voyager mission {{from a distance}} of [...] over its south pole. The close distance of the encounter allowed Voyager to acquire images of the sub-Jovian and south polar regions of Io with a best resolution of less than [...] per pixel. Unfortunately, many of the close-up images were limited by smear as the result of problems with Voyagers internal clock due to the high radiation environment, causing some narrow-angle-camera exposures of Io to be acquired while the Voyagers scan platform was moving between targets. The highest-resolution images showed a relatively young surface punctuated by oddly shaped pits that appeared more akin to volcanic calderas than to impact craters, mountains taller than Mount Everest, and features resembling volcanic lava flows. The majority of the surface was covered in smooth, layered plains, with scarps marking the boundary between different layers. Even in the highest resolution images, no impact craters were observed, suggesting that Io's surface was being regularly renewed by the present-day volcanic activity. The encounter over one of Io's poles allowed Voyager1 to directly sample the edge of the Io <b>flux</b> <b>tube,</b> finding an intense electric current of 5amperes. The color data from Voyager's cameras showed that Ionian surface was dominated by sulfur and sulfur dioxide (...) frosts. Different surface colors were thought to correspond to distinct sulfur allotropes, caused by liquid sulfur being heated to different temperatures, changing its color and viscosity.|$|E
40|$|The {{kinematic}} {{behavior of}} a dilute, two-dimensional 'gas' of parallel twisted magnetic <b>flux</b> <b>tubes</b> in a highly conducting fluid is considered. Collisions between <b>flux</b> <b>tubes</b> with {{the same sense of}} twist are inelastic due to the reconnection of their oppositely directed azimuthal magnetic field components at impact. In some collisions, the tension in the reconnected magnetic flux is sufficient to bind the two <b>flux</b> <b>tubes</b> together. Collisions between <b>flux</b> <b>tubes</b> with the opposite sense of twist are elastic. It is shown that a tenuous gas of individual twisted <b>flux</b> <b>tubes</b> condenses into two large-scale regions of magnetic field with opposite twists. This calculation illustrates the results of Montgomery and co-workers on the migration of magnetic energy towards small wavenumbers in two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. In particular, this problem illustrates the dynamical nonequilibrium of the relaxation phase in turbulent MHD systems...|$|R

2500|$|Pioneer11 {{encountered}} the Jupiter system nearly {{one year later}} on December 2, 1974, approaching to within [...] of Io. Pioneer11 provided the first spacecraft image of Io, a [...] per pixel frame (D7) over Io's north polar region taken {{from a distance of}} [...] This low-resolution image revealed dark patches on Io's surface akin to those hinted at in maps by Audouin Dollfus. Observations by both Pioneers revealed that Jupiter and Io were connected by an electrical conduit known as the Io <b>flux</b> <b>tube,</b> which consists of magnetic field lines trending from the Jupiter's poles to the satellite. Pioneer11s closer encounter with Jupiter allowed the spacecraft to discover Jupiter's intense radiation belts similar to Earth's Van Allen Belts. One of the peaks in charged particle flux was found near the orbit of Io. Radio tracking during the encounters of both Pioneers with Io provided an improved estimate of the moon's mass. This was accomplished by analyzing slight changes in trajectory of the two probes due to the influence of Io's gravity and calculating the mass necessary to produce the deviations. When this estimate was combined with the best available information on Io's size, Io was found to have the highest density of the four Galilean satellites and that the densities of the four Galilean satellites trended downward with increasing distance from Jupiter. The high density of Io (3.5g/cm3) indicated that it was composed primarily of silicate rock rather than water ice.|$|E
2500|$|Jupiter's intense {{radiation}} belts {{near the}} orbit of Io forced Galileo to come no closer than {{the orbit of}} Europa {{until the end of}} the first extended mission in 1999. Despite the lack of close-up imaging and mechanical problems that greatly restricted the amount of data returned, several significant discoveries at Io were made during Galileos two-year, primary mission. During the first several orbits, Galileo mapped Io in search of surface changes that occurred since the Voyager encounters 17 years earlier. This included the appearance of a new lava flow, Zamama, and the shifting of the Prometheus plume by [...] to the west, tracking the end of a new lava flow at Prometheus. Starting with Galileos first orbit, the spacecraft's camera, the Solid-State Imager (SSI), began taking one or two images per orbit of Io while the moon was in Jupiter's shadow. This allowed Galileo to monitor high-temperature volcanic activity on Io by observing thermal emission sources across its surface. The same eclipse images also allowed Galileo scientists to observe aurorae created by the interaction between Io's atmosphere and volcanic plumes with the Io <b>flux</b> <b>tube</b> and the plasma torus. During Galileos ninth orbit, the spacecraft observed a major eruption at Pillan Patera, detecting high-temperature thermal emission and a new volcanic plume. The temperatures observed at Pillan and other volcanoes confirmed that volcanic eruptions on Io consist of silicate lavas with magnesium-rich mafic and ultramafic compositions, with volatiles like sulfur and sulfur dioxide serving a similar role to water and carbon dioxide on Earth. During the following orbit, Galileo found that Pillan was surrounded by a new, dark pyroclastic deposit composed of silicate minerals such as orthopyroxene. The Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) observed Io on a number occasions during the primary mission, mapping its volcanic thermal emission and the distribution of sulfur dioxide frost, the absorption bands of which dominate Io's near-infrared spectrum.|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} the {{atmospheric}} and magnetic height variations are coupled in general MHS equilibria with gravity when isolated thin non-force-free <b>flux</b> <b>tubes</b> are present. In gas-dominated environments, as in stellar photospheres, <b>flux</b> <b>tubes</b> must expand rapidly with height to maintain pressure balance with the cool surroundings. But in magnetically dominated environments, as in stellar coronae, the large-scale background magnetic field determines the average spreading of embedded <b>flux</b> <b>tubes,</b> and rigidly held <b>flux</b> <b>tubes</b> require a specific surrounding atmosphere with a unique temperature profile for equilibrium. The solar static equilibrium atmosphere exhibits correct transition-region properties and the accepted base coronal temperature for the sun's main magnetic spherical harmonic. Steady flows contribute to the overall pressure, so equilibria with accelerated wind outflows are possible as well. <b>Flux</b> <b>tubes</b> reflect a mathematical degeneracy {{in the form of}} non-force-free fields, which leads to coupling in general equilibrium conditions. The equilibrium state characterizes the system average in usual circumstances and dynamics tend to maintain the MHS atmosphere.

40|$|Observations of {{whistler}} {{emissions are}} common in the magnetosphere near the dayside magnetopause. We show {{that one of the}} major source regions for these emissions is magnetic field minima that form along magnetic <b>flux</b> <b>tubes</b> at high latitudes. Using multispacecraft Cluster observations we experimentally confirm {{for the first time the}} existence of the magnetic field minima at high latitudes and we show that whistler emissions propagate away from the magnetic field minima. The strongest whistler emissions are observed on the magnetospheric <b>flux</b> <b>tubes</b> that are newly opened due to the magnetic reconnection. These <b>flux</b> <b>tubes</b> still have a density of magnetospheric plasma, but part of the high energy magnetospheric electrons have already been lost from the <b>flux</b> <b>tubes.</b> The partial loss of high energy electrons most probably causes anisotropy in electron distributions at high energies which should be the source of whistler emissions. Whistler emissions on opened <b>flux</b> <b>tubes</b> disappear as soon as the plasma density of <b>flux</b> <b>tubes</b> increases due to the entering of magnetosheath ions. We speculate that whistler emissions can most probably be used to trace the dynamics of the first opened field lines and thus the dynamics of magnetic reconnection sites...|$|R
40|$|Entangled {{magnetic}} fields entering into an accretion flow would very soon be stretched into a dominant toroidal component due to strong differentially rotating motion inside the accretion disc. This {{is particularly true}} for weakly viscous, low angular momentum transonic or advective discs. We study the trajectories of toroidal <b>flux</b> <b>tubes</b> inside a geometrically thick flow which undergoes a centrifugal force supported shock. We also study effects of these <b>flux</b> <b>tubes</b> on {{the dynamics of the}} inflow and the outflow. We use a finite difference method (Total Variation Diminishing) for this purpose and specifically focussed on whether these <b>flux</b> <b>tubes</b> significantly affect the properties of the outflows such as its collimation and the rate. It is seen that depending upon the cross-sectional radius of the <b>flux</b> <b>tubes</b> which control the drag force, these field lines may move towards the central object or oscillate vertically before eventually escaping out of the funnel wall (pressure zero surfaces) along the vertical direction.

Here we demonstrate that the rotation of the auroral emission in the dawn sector is occasionally (in half of the auroral sequences examined) slowed down and blocked near noon for a couple of hours.
