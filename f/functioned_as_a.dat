However, {{this did not}} mean that it possessed {{inferior}} anti-air abilities; as established during 1941 gunnery tests conducted on board North Carolina, the gun possessed the ability to consistently shoot down aircraft flying at , which was twice as far as the effective range of the earlier single purpose 5-inch/25 anti-air gun.|$|E

The first two Vasa kings were well known for patronizing both the arts and sciences. After that the Commonwealth's science experienced general decline, which paralleled the wartime decline of the burgher class.|$|E

At that time, the temple was thought by the Japanese visitors as the famed Jetavana garden of the Buddha, which originally located {{in the kingdom of}} Magadha, India.

A total of 31 (30 manned, 1 unmanned) Soyuz spacecraft flew to the station over a fourteen-year period.|$|E
5|$|The Plebeian Council (concilium plebis) was the {{principal}} popular gathering of the Roman Republic.

This council had no political power until the offices of Plebeian Tribune and Plebeian Aedile were created in 494 BC, due to the Plebeian Secession that year.|$|E

As dinosaur discoveries multiplied, Velociraptor was later recognized as a dromaeosaurid. All dromaeosaurids have also been referred to the family Archaeopterygidae by at least one author (which would, in effect, make Velociraptor a flightless bird).|$|E
