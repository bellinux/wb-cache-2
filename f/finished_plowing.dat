50|$|While he {{had been}} {{expected}} to get a first in History and to win a scholarship to further pursue his own research in the Tudor period, {{en route to a}} career in academia, he instead received an upper second on his last exam. His only choice if he was to proceed on a PhD program would be to work under the close direction of a supervisor on a topic not of his own choosing. He laboured at that unpleasant task for two years before discovering that another person was almost <b>finished</b> <b>plowing</b> the same research ground, making award of a PhD unlikely. Pearce henceforth chose to follow a different path.|$|E
60|$|Rob {{was from}} one of the finest {{counties}} of Wisconsin, over toward Milwaukee. He was of German parentage, a middle-sized, cheery, wide-awake, good-looking young fellow-a typical claimholder. He was always confident, jovial, and full of plans for the future. He had dug his own well, built his own shanty, washed and mended his own clothing. He could do anything, and do it well. He had a fine field of wheat, and was <b>finishing</b> the <b>plowing</b> of his entire quarter section.|$|R
60|$|After dinner, Stuyvesant told Phonny that {{he should}} be glad to help him about his cage, were it not that he was engaged to go with Beechnut that afternoon, to plow. Phonny was very sorry to hear this. In fact he had a great mind to go himself, and help plow, and so put off making his cage until the next day. It is very {{probable}} that he would have decided upon this plan, but while he was hesitating about it, Beechnut came to tell Stuyvesant {{that he should}} not be able to <b>finish</b> the <b>plowing</b> that day, for he was obliged to go away. Then Stuyvesant said that he would help Phonny. So they went together into the shop.|$|R
60|$|One {{reason why}} Alexander desired {{to go to}} Gordium was that he wished to untie the famous Gordian knot. The story of the Gordian knot was this. Gordius {{was a sort of}} {{mountain}} farmer. One day he was plowing, and an eagle came down and alighted upon his yoke, and remained there until he had <b>finished</b> his <b>plowing.</b> This was an omen, but what was the signification of it? Gordius did not know, and he accordingly went to a neighboring town in order to consult the prophets and soothsayers. On his way he met a damsel, who, like Rebecca in the days of Abraham, was going forth to draw water. Gordius fell into conversation with her, and related to her the occurrence which had interested him so strongly. The maiden advised him to go back and offer a sacrifice to Jupiter. Finally, she consented to go back with him and aid him. The affair ended in her becoming his wife, and they lived together in peace for many years upon their farm.|$|R
25|$|On the {{previous}} day, {{the governor of}} New York had {{decided to use the}} National Guard and the New York State Department of Transportation (NYDOT) to help clean up snow in the City of Buffalo, not knowing a blizzard would hit. Some NYDOT equipment had arrived in Buffalo while the National Guard was not yet mobilized, but a meeting was being held at the Buffalo city garage that morning to coordinate the efforts. Before the meeting <b>finished,</b> Buffalo city <b>plows</b> started to return to the garage {{due to a lack of}} visibility; they reported they were unable to see even their own plow blades. By 11:30 am, most workers in the City of Buffalo had been released early, but few made it home. At 11:35 am, lightning was seen in the darkening sky.|$|R
5000|$|In agriculture, a harrow (often {{called a}} set of harrows in a plurale tantum sense) is an {{implement}} for breaking up and smoothing out {{the surface of the}} soil. In this way it is distinct in its effect from the plough, which is used for deeper tillage. Harrowing is often carried out on fields to follow the rough <b>finish</b> left by <b>plowing</b> operations. The purpose of this harrowing is generally to break up clods (lumps of soil) and to provide a finer finish, a good tilth or soil structure that is suitable for seedbed use. Coarser harrowing may also be used to remove weeds and to cover seed after sowing. Harrows differ from cultivators in that they disturb the whole surface of the soil, such as to prepare a seedbed, instead of disturbing only narrow trails that skirt crop rows (to kill weeds).|$|R
