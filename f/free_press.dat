In addition to the right of assembly guaranteed by this clause, the Court has also ruled that the amendment implicitly protects freedom of association.|$|E

5|$|Analyzing the results, The Burlington <b>Free</b> <b>Press</b> {{pointed to}} Shumlin's {{relatively}} soft numbers in opinion polls – {{he was in}} the mid-40s in the last four polls of the race – as evidence that voters were dissatisfied with the progress the state had made in instituting single-payer health care, with rising property taxes, and with the unsuccessful roll-out of Vermont Health Connect, the state's federal health care exchange. Shumlin's internal polls showed a close race and he touted an endorsement from U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy to try to put him over 50%. By comparison, Milne lagged in fundraising and spending, with $100,000 available compared to Shumlin's $1.1 million, which meant that he could not afford to pay for polling.|$|E

In Gitlow v. New York, the court by a 6–2 vote with Taft in the majority, upheld Gitlow's conviction on criminal anarchy charges for advocating the overthrow of the government; his defense was freedom of speech. Justice Edward T. Sanford wrote the court's opinion, and both majority and minority (Holmes, joined by Brandeis) assumed that the First Amendment's Free Speech and <b>Free</b> <b>Press</b> clauses were protected against infringement by the states.|$|E

5|$|In {{her book}} {{column for the}} Detroit <b>Free</b> <b>Press,</b> Marta Salij said that Cal's {{identity}} crisis resembles Odysseus's fate. Whereas the mythical hero is troubled by Poseidon and succored by Athena, the intersex protagonist is affected by his chromosomes in a similar manner. John Sykes, professor of English and religion education, noted another Greek-hero reference. In {{a manner similar to}} Oedipus's fulfillment of Pythia's prophecy to slay his father and marry his mother, Callie validates the prediction her grandmother made before her birth by adopting a male identity. Eugenides also used the allusions to Greek mythology and modern pop music to show the passing of familial traits and idiosyncrasies {{from one generation to the}} next.|$|E
5|$|Palmer and Buckner {{both had}} {{developed}} reputations as independent executives {{while serving as}} governors of their respective states. Because they had served on opposite sides during the Civil War, their presence on the same ticket emphasized national unity. The ticket was endorsed by several major newspapers including the Chicago Chronicle, Louisville Courier-Journal, Detroit <b>Free</b> <b>Press,</b> Richmond Times, and New Orleans Picayune. Despite these advantages, the ticket was hurt by the candidates' ages, Palmer being 79and Buckner 73. Further, some supporters feared that voting for the National Democrat ticket would be a wasted vote and might even throw the election to Bryan. Ultimately, Palmer and Buckner received just over {{one percent of the}} vote in the election.|$|E

50|$|Since the autocracy {{considered}} Tolstoyism an enemy, Chertkov {{left for}} England in 1897. He {{was an avid}} Anglophile like his mother, admired the English tradition of free speech, and was already corresponding with a small collective based at Purleigh in Essex, who were looking to put Tolstoy's ideas into practice. It was to Purleigh, therefore, that Chertkov initially gravitated and {{it was here that}} he set up a publishing company, the <b>Free</b> Word <b>Press</b> (Свободное слово), producing Russian-language versions of Tolstoy's works and kindred literature, much of which was smuggled back into Russia. A separate branch of this business, the <b>Free</b> Age <b>Press,</b> producing English-language texts, was set up in 1900. Chertkov's wife, Anna Konstantinovna, née Dieterichs (1859-1927), was trustee of the <b>Free</b> Word <b>Press</b> and produced several texts for both arms of the business.|$|R
