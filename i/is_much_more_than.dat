In this episode, The Lone Gunmen summon Mulder and Scully to the headquarters of a video game design company after a new virtual reality game, which the Gunmen helped design, is taken over by a bizarre female computer character whose power <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> virtual.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, a {{wind farm}} of 17 {{turbines}} was erected {{at the western}} cape. It has a nominal power capacity of 10.2 MW energy, and produces 30 GWh of electricity every year. This <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> what the island needs, and the excess is transferred to mainland Anatolia through an underground and partly undersea cable. Overhead cables and pylons were avoided for esthetic reasons, preserving the scenic view. The land has an average wind speed of 6.4m/s and a mean energy density of 324W/mat its meteorological station. This indicates significant wind energy generation potential.|$|E

Trapping or hunting pits {{were placed in}} areas in close proximity of the hunted animal in question, usually in known places where the animals moved. Because of this there are several places where pits have been dug separately in lines stretching on for miles throughout the landscape. Several place names in Jämtland still display the significance these pits had to the tribes.|$|E
25|$|Case studies aside, modern {{experiments}} {{have demonstrated that}} the relation between brain and mind <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> simple correlation. By damaging, or manipulating, specific {{areas of the brain}} repeatedly under controlled conditions (e.g. in monkeys) and reliably obtaining the same results in measures of mental state and abilities, neuroscientists have shown that the relation between damage to the brain and mental deterioration is likely causal. This conclusion is further supported by data from the effects of neuro-active chemicals (such as those affecting neurotransmitters) on mental functions, but also from research on neurostimulation (direct electrical stimulation of the brain, including transcranial magnetic stimulation).|$|E
25|$|In a triode {{radio-frequency}} (RF) amplifier, if {{both the}} plate (anode) and grid {{are connected to}} resonant circuits tuned to the same frequency, stray capacitive coupling between the grid and the plate will cause the amplifier to go into oscillation if the stage gain <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> unity. In early designs, dozens (in some cases over 100) low-gain triode stages had to be connected in cascade to make workable equipment, which drew enormous amounts of power in operation and required a team of maintenance engineers. The strategic value was so high, however, that the British Admiralty felt the high cost was justified.|$|E

25|$|If the PTCS cannot keep up {{with the}} heat load, an External Active Thermal Control System (EATCS) {{maintains}} the temperature. The EATCS consists of an internal, non-toxic, water coolant loop used to cool and dehumidify the atmosphere, which transfers collected heat into an external liquid ammonia loop that can withstand the much lower temperature of space, and is circulated through radiators to remove the heat. The EATCS provides cooling for all the US pressurised modules, including Kibō and Columbus, as well as the main power distribution electronics of the S0, S1 and P1 trusses. It can reject up to 70kW. This <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the 14kW of the Early External Active Thermal Control System (EEATCS) via the Early Ammonia Servicer (EAS), which was launched on STS-105 and installed onto the P6 Truss.|$|E

25|$|Oxygen diffuses through {{membranes}} {{and into}} {{red blood cells}} after inhalation into the lungs. They are bound to dioxygen complexes, which are coordination compounds that contain O2 as a ligand, providing a more efficient oxygen-loading capacity. In blood, the heme group of hemoglobin binds oxygen when it is present, changing hemoglobin's color from bluish red to bright red. is released from {{another part of the}} hemoglobin molecule, as its acid, which causes CO2 to be released from bicarbonate, its major reservoir in blood plasma (see Bohr effect) Vertebrate animals use hemoglobin in their blood to transport oxygen from their lungs to their tissues, but other animals use hemocyanin (molluscs and some arthropods) or hemerythrin (spiders and lobsters).

25|$|This {{means that}} a 5% {{reduction}} in operating voltage will {{more than double the}} life of the bulb, at the expense of reducing its light output by about 16%. This may be a very acceptable trade off for a light bulb that is in a difficult-to-access location (for example, traffic lights or fixtures hung from high ceilings). Long-life bulbs take advantage of this trade-off. Since the value of the electric power they consume <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the value of the lamp, general service lamps emphasize efficiency over long operating life. The objective is to minimize the cost of light, not the cost of lamps. Early bulbs had a life of up to 2500 hours, but in 1924 a cartel agreed to limit life to 1000 hours. When this was exposed in 1953, General Electric and other leading American manufacturers were banned from limiting the life.|$|E

500|$|The Committee's {{report was}} {{discussed}} in Parliament from 16 to 18 January 2012. Setting out {{the position of}} the Workers' Party, Chen Show Mao said that the basic monthly salary of an MP should be $11,000, the pay of an MX9-grade director in the Management Executive Scheme of the Civil Service. A minister should be paid five times this sum ($55,000), and the Prime Minister nine times ($99,000). NCMP Gerald Giam said that ministers should obtain an average annual bonus of three months of their base salaries, and in any case no more than five months' bonus. Two-thirds of the bonus should be made up of the national bonus, and the remaining third based on the individual's performance, which should be determined according to key performance indicators fixed for each ministry {{at the start of a}} new government's term. Moreover, only a portion of bonuses should be paid at the end of each year. Payment of the remainder should be deferred till the end of the government's term. If the minister's performance is poor, some of the withheld bonus should be clawed back. The WP's proposal was criticized by a number of PAP MPs. Minister of State for Health Amy Khor expressed the view that [...] "olitical service <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> public service.
