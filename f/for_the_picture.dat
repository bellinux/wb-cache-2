His co-star, Frank Sinatra, ceded top-billing to guarantee Tracy <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture.</b> Continuing his pattern of indecisiveness, Tracy briefly pulled out of the production before recommitting. Critics were unenthusiastic about the film, which was nevertheless Tracy's most successful box office outing since Father of the Bride.|$|E
5|$|Sound {{designer}} Frank Serafine, {{a longtime}} Star Trek fan, {{was invited to}} create the sound effects <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture.</b> Given access to state-of-the-art audio equipment, Serafine saw the picture as the chance to modernize outdated motion picture sound techniques with digital technology. Owing to background noise such as camera operation, much of the ambient noise or dialogue captured on set was unusable; it was Serafine's job to create or recreate sounds to mix back into the scenes.|$|E

She was first selected to exhibit in the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award in 2002. One of her pieces, Awelye Atnwengerrp, was exhibited in the 2003 Award, in which her name was given as Minnie Motorcar Apwerl (Pwerle). The artist's asking price <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture,</b> A$44,000, was the second-highest in the exhibition and the highest for an artist from the central and western deserts.

25|$|Other issues {{involving}} photojournalism include {{the right to}} privacy and the compensation of the news subject. Especially regarding pictures of violence, photojournalists face the ethical dilemma of whether or not to publish images of the victims. The victim's right to privacy is sometimes not addressed or the picture is printed without their knowledge or consent. The compensation of the subject is another issue. Subjects often want to be paid in order <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> to be published, especially if the picture is of a controversial subject.|$|E

25|$|Ray Mala {{was born}} Ray Wise {{in the small}} village of Candle, Alaska to a Russian Jewish {{immigrant}} father and a Native Alaskan mother. He was born during a unique period in Alaskan history. At that time Alaska was still a territory of the United States and still a mystery to many Americans. In 1921 an explorer named Captain Frank Kleinschmidt went to Alaska on an expedition to film a picture called Primitive Love in which Mala makes his film debut at age 14. Not only does Mala act {{in front of the}} camera but he serves as a cameraman as well <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture.</b> From here young Mala accompanied Knud Rasmussen, the Danish Arctic explorer and writer on his trip called The Great Sled Journey from 1921 to 1924 to collect and describe Inuit songs and legends as the official cameraman.|$|E

25|$|In {{the years}} after the failure of Billy Jack Goes to Washington, Laughlin played small roles in a few films, such as The Big Sleep in 1978 and his last acting role was The Legend of the Lone Ranger in 1981. In 1984, he {{purchased}} a series of twelve advertisements in Variety condemning {{various aspects of the}} film industry and its treatment of independent filmmakers. He created a blueprint for taking control of the home video distribution industry as a way for independent films to be seen. This plan was also a failure. In 1985, he began production of a fifth Billy Jack film, The Return of Billy Jack, which featured the title character fighting child pornographers in New York City. However, he suffered a concussion and neck injury during filming, which led to the production being suspended. During this hiatus, funding <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> ran out and production was never resumed. In 2009, a few scenes from the unfinished film were released on Laughlin's website. A notable incident occurred while he was filming in New York City, when he broke up a street fight on Manhattan's West Side, threatening to rip a man's arm off. He garnered notoriety at this time for making a citizen's arrest of a man after an argument over Laughlin's driving.|$|E

500|$|Motography {{included}} a {{brief review of}} the film which states, [...] "This is indeed a well presented historical subject. The action has breadth and historical perspective, with stirring scenes and large groupings, {{and at the same time}} there is a human plot threading its way through the historical background and giving the action a specific interest. The last scene, showing Santa Anna's surrender [...] "as a common soldier," [...] is rather obscure. One wonders why he did it. In all other scenes the action is clear and effective. It would be a stolid audience indeed that failed to respond to the thrilling scene inside the Alamo." [...] The Moving Picture Worlds review stated that [...] " [...] is a very thrilling and altogether satisfactory reproduction of an important historical episode. The company deserves the highest commendation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> and the way it is produced." ...|$|E
500|$|Richard H. Kline {{served as}} the film's cinematographer. Working from sketch artist Maurice Zuberano's concepts, Wise would judge {{if they were on}} the right track. Kline and Michelson would then discuss the look they wanted (along with Weldon, if effects were involved.) Each {{sequence}} was then storyboarded and left to Kline to execute. The cinematographer called his function to [...] "interpret [...] preplanning and make it indelible on film. It's a way of everybody being on the same wavelength." [...] Kline would recall that {{there was not a single}} [...] "easy" [...] shot to produce <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture,</b> as each scene required special consideration. The bridge, for example, was lit with a low density of light to make the console monitors display better.

500|$|Andrée Hayum {{argues that}} the {{commissioning}} of the tondo by the Doni family helped to emphasize the [...] "secular and domestic ideals" [...] of the painting rather than seeing it as a [...] "devotional object." [...] In choosing a tondo as the format <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture,</b> Michelangelo is referencing the form’s long association with depicting the [...] "Adoration of the Magi, the Nativity, [...] the Madonna and Child." [...] Hayum also finds many allusions to Noah throughout the work. [...] She posits a referencing of the Madonna to Noah’s daughter-in-law, a sibyl, which thus makes Joseph an embodiment of Noah himself. [...] Hayum further supports this by acknowledging the direct link between Joseph and Noah as depicted in Michelangelo’s Sistine Ceiling paintings. [...] This link to Noah also gives an explanation to the nudes in the background, whose forms may have inspired the sons in the Drunkenness of Noah. [...] The allusion to the Noah story also brings up themes of baptismal water, thus giving rise to {{an interpretation of the}} nudes similar to D’Ancona’s: [...] "catechumens awaiting baptism" [...] from John the Baptist, whose [...] "isolation within a pit-like space" [...] indicates his special role as baptizer.|$|E
500|$|The {{marriage}} to Powell increased Lombard's fame, while {{she continued to}} please critics with her work in Up Pops the Devil and I Take this Woman (both 1931). In reviews for the latter film, which co-starred Gary Cooper, several critics predicted that Lombard was set to become a major star. She went on to appear in five films throughout 1932. No One Man and Sinners in the Sun were not successful, but Edward Buzzell's romantic picture Virtue was well received. After featuring in the drama No More Orchids, Lombard was cast as {{the wife of a}} con artist in No Man of Her Own. Her co-star <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> was Clark Gable, who was rapidly becoming one of Hollywood's top stars. The film was a critical and commercial success, and Wes Gehring writes that it was [...] "arguably Lombard's finest film appearance" [...] to that point. It was the only picture that Gable and Lombard, future husband and wife, made together. There was no romantic interest at this time however, as she recounted to Garson Kanin: [...] " [...] did all kinds of hot love scenes... and I never got any kind of tremble out of him at all".|$|E

[...] Fairy tale lecturer Jack Zipes alike noted that [...] "it is somewhat strange that the queen believes the mirror, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> of Snow White reveals {{that she is a}} pretty pubescent red-cheeked ordinary girl while the queen is a stunning beautiful mature woman who might easily win a beauty contest." ...|$|E
