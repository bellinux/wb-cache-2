40|$|The high-latitude oceans {{serve as}} {{freshwater}} sources and heat sinks {{for the global}} thermohaline circulation, exerting significant influence on ocean general circulation and climate variability. Warm surface flows carry heat toward the poles where intense heat loss to the atmosphere drives densification and produces an equatorward return flow of intermediate and bottom waters. This exchange establishes the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) which, when combined with the inter-basin <b>exchange</b> <b>permitted</b> by the zonally unbounded Southern Ocean geometry, supports the global thermohaline circulation. High-latitude convection thus ventilates the many mid- and low-latitude density layers which outcrop in the polar/subpolar oceans, setting subsurface density structure and removing carbon to the ocean interior. In contrast, net precipitation in the polar regions produces an equatorward freshwater flux that is largely confined to the upper ocean. Fresh waters exiting the Arctic can form a low-density surface barrier that inhibits convective overturning at the deep water formation sites in the Labrador and Greenland Seas, modulating {{the strength of the}} MOC and thus the exchange of heat from equator to pole.

40|$|In {{several species}} genetic {{differentiation}} across environmental gradients or between geographically separate populations {{has been reported}} to center at “genomic islands of divergence,” resulting in heterogeneous differentiation patterns across genomes. Here, genomic regions of elevated divergence were observed on three chromosomes of the highly mobile fish Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) within geographically fine-scaled coastal areas. The “genomic islands” extended at least 5, 9. 5, and 13 megabases on linkage groups 2, 7, and 12, respectively, and coincided with large blocks of linkage disequilibrium. For each of these three chromosomes, pairs of segregating, highly divergent alleles were identified, with little or no gene exchange between them. These patterns of recombination and divergence mirror genomic signatures previously described for large polymorphic inversions, which have been shown to repress recombination across extensive chromosomal segments. The lack of genetic <b>exchange</b> <b>permits</b> divergence between noninverted and inverted chromosomes in spite of gene flow. For the rearrangements on linkage groups 2 and 12, allelic frequency shifts between coastal and oceanic environments suggest a role in ecological adaptation, in agreement with recently reported associations between molecular variation within these genomic regions and temperature, oxygen, and salinity levels. Elevated genetic differentiation in these genomic regions has previously been described {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic Ocean, and we therefore suggest that these polymorphisms are involved in adaptive divergence across the species distributional range...|$|R
40|$|In {{light of}} recent {{theoretical}} and empirical developments {{in the areas of}} reading, writing, and learning, this article proposes a view of literacy learning in which various forms of reading and writing are conceptualized as unique ways of thinking about and exploring a topic of study en route to acquiring knowledge. Throughout this article, we take the theoretical position that a topic of study is analogous to a conceptual “landscape” about which knowledge is best acquired by “traversing” it from a variety of perspectives. In this system, different forms of reading and writing represent the “traversal routes” through which an individual can explore a given content domain. Specifically, we wish to argue that more complex or diverse combinations of different forms of reading and writing provide a learner with the means to conduct a more critical inquiry of a topic by virtue of the multiple perspectives or ways of “seeing” and thinking that these reading and writing <b>exchanges</b> <b>permit.</b> Finally, in light of this theoretical orientation, we contend that the ability to direct dynamically one's own reading and writing engagements en route to learning is central to conducting an inquiry of this nature. This perspective suggests a reexamination of a line of research that has pursued the question of how writing in combination with reading influences thinking and learning...|$|R
40|$|Hemerocallis plantlets {{maintained}} in vitro {{for extended periods}} of time in tightly closed culture vessels frequently show a phenotype, albeit on a miniaturized scale, typical of more mature, field-grown plants. The positive relationship of elevated ethylene in the headspace of such vessels to the phase shift from juvenile to mature form is established. Rigorous restriction in air exchange with the external environment by means of silicone grease seals hastens the phase change and improves uniformity of response. Although some plantlets may take longer to accumulate enough ethylene in sealed jars to undergo change, added ethylene and ethylene-releasing agents promote it. Ethylene adsorbants (e. g. mercuric perchlorate) block the shift of juvenile to mature form. Critical ambient ethylene level for the shift is ca 1 microliter l- 1. Levels up to 1000 microliters l- 1 do not hasten the response but are not toxic. The phase change is fully reversible when air <b>exchange</b> <b>permits</b> ethylene to drop below 1 microliter l- 1. At least 1 microliter l- 1 ethylene is required to sustain the mature phenotype. The ethylene synthesis inhibitor aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG) prevents the phase change, while the ethylene biosynthesis intermediate 1 -aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acid (ACC) improves it. KOH, as a CO 2 absorbent, does not prevent the phase change. Histology sections demonstrate subtle changes in the form of shoot tips of plantlets undergoing phase change...|$|R
40|$|The {{origins of}} money and banking are {{explained}} in nearly every introduction money and banking course, but Wray proposes an alternative approach that emerges from a comparative analysis of economic institutions. Orthodox theory suggests that barter replaced self-sufficiency and increased efficiency by fostering specialization- subsequently, establishing some object as a medium of <b>exchange</b> <b>permits</b> greater efficiency. In essence, the orthodox economist espouses the view that we operate in a free market economy in which "neutral money is used primarily to facilitate exchange of real goods, undertaken by self-interested maximizers for personal gain. " Institutionalists reject this argument because it emerges {{from the perspective of}} a rational economic agent facing scarce resources and unlimited wants-thus, the focus is on choice. Wray states that economic analyses must incorporate interactions between humans and nature, and that the economy is a "component of the material life process of society. " Hence, the conventionalists' focus on choice should instead be directed at production and distribution. The Wray thesis suggests that money is necessarily endogenously determined: Monetary economies have not, and cannot, operate with exogenous money supply can function with a commodity reserve system, such a system is subject to periodic debt deflations. In sum, the monetarist policy prescription would be counterproductive to systemic stability and would not yield greater control of the money supply. ...|$|R
40|$|Summary. A model {{predicting}} {{net photosynthesis}} of individual plant leaves {{for a variety}} of environmental conditions has been developed. It is based on an electrical analogue describing as diffusion from the free atmosphere to the sites of COs fixation and a Michaelis-Menten equation describing C 02 fixation. The model is presented in two versions, a simplified form without respiration and a more complex form including respiration. Both versions include t rms for light and temperature d pendence of C 02 fixation and light control of stomatal resistance. The second version also includes terms for temperature, light, and oxygen depend-ence of respiration and 03 dependence of CO S fixation. The model is illustrated with curves based on representative alues of the various environmental and biological parameters. These curves relate net photo-synthesis to light intensity, [COs], [03], temperature, and resistances to COs uptake. The shape of the [C 02]-net photosynthesis curves depends on the total diffusion resistance to CO 2 uptake and the Michaelis constant for CO s uptake. The curves range from typical Michaelis-Menten to Blackman types. The model is combined with a model of leaf energy <b>exchange</b> <b>permitting</b> simultaneous e timation of net photosynthesis and transpiration.
