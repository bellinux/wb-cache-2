This simple Neumann boundary condition selects the Einstein solution out of the more numerous solutions of conformal gravity. It thus removes the ghosts of conformal gravity from this computation. In the case of a five dimensional pure gravity theory with a positive cosmological constant we show that the late time superhorizon tree level probability measure, |Ψ [g]|^ 2, for its <b>four</b> <b>dimensional</b> spatial slices is given by the action of Euclidean <b>four</b> <b>dimensional</b> conformal gravity.

40|$|We {{investigate}} brane {{physics in}} a universe with an extra dimensional global monopole and negative bulk cosmological constant. The graviton zero mode is naturally divergent; we thus invoke a physical cut-off to induce <b>four</b> <b>dimensional</b> gravity on a brane at the monopole core. Independently, the massive Kaluza-Klein modes have naturally compactified extra dimensions, inducing a discrete spectrum. This spectrum remains consistent with <b>four</b> <b>dimensional</b> gravity on the brane, even for small mass gap. Extra dimensional matter fields also induce <b>four</b> <b>dimensional</b> matter fields on the brane, with the same Kaluza-Klein spectrum of excited states. We choose parameters to solve the hierarchy problem; that is, to induce the observed hierarchy between particle and Planck scales in the effective <b>four</b> <b>dimensional</b> universe.

40|$|New <b>four</b> <b>dimensional</b> N = 2 field {{theories}} can be engineered from compactifying six dimensional (2, 0) superconformal {{field theory}} on a punctured Riemann surface. Hitchin?s equation is defined on this Riemann {{surface and the}} fields in Hitchin?s equation are singular at the punctures. <b>Four</b> <b>dimensional</b> theory is entirely determined by the data at the punctures. Theory without lagrangian description can also be constructed in this way. We first construct new <b>four</b> <b>dimensional</b> generalized superconformal quiver gauge theory by putting regular singularity at the puncture. The algorithm of calculating weakly coupled gauge group in any duality frame is developed. The asymptotical free theory and Argyres-Douglas field theory can also be constructed using six dimensional method. This requires introducing irregular singularity of Hithcin?s equation. Compactify <b>four</b> <b>dimensional</b> theory down to three dimensions, the corresponding N = 4 theory has the interesting mirror symmetry. The mirror theory for the generalized superconformal quiver gauge theory can be derived using the data at the puncture too. Motivated by this construction, we study other three dimensional theories deformed from the above theory and find their mirrors.

40|$|We {{consider}} five dimensional deSitter spacetimes with {{a deficit}} angle {{due to the}} presence of a closed 2 -brane and identify one dimension as an extra dimension. From the <b>four</b> <b>dimensional</b> viewpoint we can see that the spacetime has a structure similar to a Kaluza-Klein bubble of nothing, that is, <b>four</b> <b>dimensional</b> spacetime ends at the 2 -brane. Since a spatial section of the full deSitter spacetime has the topology of a sphere, the boundary surface surrounds the remaining <b>four</b> <b>dimensional</b> spacetime, and can be considered as the celestial sphere. After the spacetime is created from nothing via an instanton which we describe, some <b>four</b> <b>dimensional</b> observers in it see the celestial sphere falling down, and will be in contact with a 2 -brane attached on it.

40|$|We {{consider}} six and <b>four</b> <b>dimensional</b> N = 1 supersymmetric orientifolds of Type IIB compactified on orbifolds. We {{give the}} conditions under which the perturbative world-sheet orientifold approach is adequate, and list the <b>four</b> <b>dimensional</b> N = 1 orientifolds (which are rather constrained) that satisfy these conditions. We argue that in most cases orientifolds contain non-perturbative sectors that are missing in the world-sheet approach. These non-perturbative sectors {{can be thought of as}} arising from D-branes wrapping various collapsed 2 -cycles in the orbifold. Using these observations, we explain certain “puzzles” in the literature on <b>four</b> <b>dimensional</b> orientifolds. In particular, in some <b>four</b> <b>dimensional</b> orientifolds the “naive ” tadpole cancellation conditions have no solution. However, these tadpole cancellation conditions are derived using the world-sheet approach which we argue to be inadequate in these cases due to appearance of additional non-perturbative sectors. The main tools in our analyses are the map between F-theory and orientifold vacua and Type I-heterotic duality. Utilizing the consistency conditions we have found in this paper, we discuss consistent <b>four</b> <b>dimensional</b> chiral N = 1 Type I vacua which are non-perturbative from the heterotic viewpoint...|$|R
40|$|We {{construct}} a classical mechanics Hamiltonian which exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking akin the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism, dimensional transmutation, and asymptotically free self-similarity {{congruent with the}} beta-function of <b>four</b> <b>dimensional</b> Yang-Mills theory. Its classical equations of motion support stable periodic orbits and in a three dimensional projection these orbits are self-linked into topologically nontrivial, toroidal knots. The non-perturbative structure of <b>four</b> <b>dimensional</b> Yang-Mills theory {{continues to be the}} subject of extensive investigations. A major goal is the understanding of large distance properties such as color confinement, mass gap and the glueball spectrum. The Yang-Mills theory has also a number of well established salient features like ultraviolet asymptotic freedom and the presence of finite action instantons. Here we shall introduce a classical mechanics Hamiltonian which contains many incredients of the <b>four</b> <b>dimensional</b> Yang-Mills field theory, even though it is defined in a <b>four</b> <b>dimensional</b> phase space. These include asymptotically free self-similarity with a coupling constant that flows like the one loop coupling constant of <b>four</b> <b>dimensional</b> Yang-Mills theory, dimensional transmutation, and spontaneous symmetry breaking akin the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism.

40|$|From the {{constructions of}} the quantum spacetime, a <b>four</b> <b>dimensional</b> {{quantized}} spacetime can be {{embedded in a}} five dimensional continuous spacetime. Thus to observe from the five dimensional continuous spacetime where the <b>four</b> <b>dimensional</b> quantized spacetime is embedded, there exist the energy-momentum flows between the five dimensional continuous spacetime and the <b>four</b> <b>dimensional</b> quantized spacetime. This makes the energy-momentum not locally conserved generally on the <b>four</b> <b>dimensional</b> quantized spacetime. We propose that energy-momentum tensors of noncommutative field theories constructed from the Noether approach are just the correct forms for the energy-momentum tensors of noncommutative field theories. The non-vanishing of the total divergences of the energy-momentum tensors of noncommutative field theories just reflect that energy-momentum are not locally conserved on noncommutative spacetime. At the same time, from the constructions of the quantum spacetime, we propose that the total spacetime dimension of the quantum spacetime is infinite. Comment: 18 pages Late...|$|R

40|$|Fefferman and Graham {{showed some}} time ago that <b>four</b> <b>dimensional</b> {{conformal}} geometries could be analyzed in terms of six dimensional, ambient, Riemannian geometries admitting a closed homothety. Recently it was shown how conformal geometry provides a description of physics manifestly invariant under local choices of unit systems. Strikingly, Einstein's equations are then equivalent {{to the existence of}} a parallel scale tractor (a six component vector subject to a certain first order covariant constancy condition at every point in <b>four</b> <b>dimensional</b> spacetime). These results suggest a six <b>dimensional</b> description of <b>four</b> <b>dimensional</b> physics, a viewpoint promulgated by the two times physics program of Bars. The Fefferman [...] Graham construction relies on a triplet of operators corresponding, respectively to a curved six dimensional light cone, the dilation generator and the Laplacian. These form an sp(2) algebra which Bars employs as a first class algebra of constraints in a six-dimensional gauge theory. In this article <b>four</b> <b>dimensional</b> gravity is recast in terms of six dimensional quantum mechanics by melding the two times and tractor approaches. This "parent" formulation of gravity is built from an infinite set of six dimensional fields.
