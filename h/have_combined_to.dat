In the autumn, Weaver campaigned in the North, but the Greenbackers' lack of support was compounded by Weaver's refusal to run a fusion ticket in states where Democratic and Greenbacker strength might <b>have</b> <b>combined</b> <b>to</b> outvote the Republicans.|$|E
5|$|Canada is a {{multilingual}} {{and multicultural}} society home {{to people of}} many different ethnic, religious and national origins, {{with the majority of}} the population made up of Old World immigrants and their descendants. Following the initial period of French and then the much larger British colonization, different waves (or peaks) of immigration and settlement of non-indigenous peoples took place over the course of nearly two centuries and continue today. Elements of Indigenous, French, British, and more recent immigrant customs, languages and religions <b>have</b> <b>combined</b> <b>to</b> form the culture of Canada and thus a Canadian identity. Canada has also been strongly influenced by its linguistic, geographic and economic neighbour, the United States.|$|E

His delusions of grandeur are readily visible in his will and in his desire to conquer the world, in as much as he is by various sources described as having boundless ambition, an epithet, the meaning of which has descended into an historical cliché.|$|E

5|$|In a {{departure}} from the political traditions of the day, Weaver himself campaigned, making speeches across the South in July and August. As the Greenbackers had the only ticket that included a Southerner, Weaver and Chambers hoped to make inroads in the South. As the campaign progressed, however, Weaver's message of racial inclusion drew violent protests in the South, as the Greenbackers faced the same obstacles the Republicans did in the face of increasing black disenfranchisement. In the autumn, Weaver campaigned in the North, but the Greenbackers' lack of support was compounded by Weaver's refusal to run a fusion ticket in states where Democratic and Greenbacker strength might <b>have</b> <b>combined</b> <b>to</b> outvote the Republicans.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the major}} party candidates, Weaver {{planned to take}} the field himself, giving speeches around the country. His running mate, Chambers, was to do the same, until a fall from a train in July {{disabled}} him {{for the duration of}} the campaign. As the Greenbackers had the only ticket that included a Southerner, he hoped to make inroads in that region. Weaver's path to victory, already unlikely, was made more difficult by his refusal to run a fusion ticket in states where Democratic and Greenbacker strength might <b>have</b> <b>combined</b> <b>to</b> outvote the Republicans. His party's message of racial inclusion also presaged difficulty in the South, as the Greenbackers would face the same obstacles the Republicans did in the face of increasing black disenfranchisement.|$|E

The entire flora of the Socotra Archipelago has been assessed for the IUCN Red List, with 3 Critically Endangered and 27 Endangered plant species recognised in 2004.|$|E

25|$|The wealthy gold-rich Asante people {{developed}} {{the large and}} influential Ashanti Empire, along the Lake Volta and Gulf of Guinea. The empire was founded in 1670, and the Ashanti capital Kumasi was founded in 1680 the late 17th century by Asantehene (emperor) Osei Kofi Tutu I {{on the advice of}} Ɔkͻmfoͻ Anͻkye, his premier. Sited at the crossroads of the Trans-Saharan trade routes, the Kumasi megacity's strategic location contributed significantly to its growing wealth. Over the duration of the Kumasi metropolis' existence, a number of peculiar factors <b>have</b> <b>combined</b> <b>to</b> transform the Kumasi metropolis into a fitting financial centre and political capital. The main causal factors included the unquestioning loyalty to the Ashanti monarchy and the Kumasi metropolis' growing wealth, derived in part from the capital's lucrative domestic-trade in items such as bullion.|$|E
25|$|The Aosta Valley is {{nowadays}} {{the only}} {{region of the}} Franco-Provençal area where this language is still widely spoken as native by all age ranges of the population. Several events <b>have</b> <b>combined</b> <b>to</b> stabilize the language (Valdôtain dialect) in this region since 1948. An {{amendment to the constitution}} of Italy changed the status of the former province to an autonomous region which gives the Aosta Valley special powers to make its own decisions. Residents saw the region's economy expand and the population increase from 1951 to 1991, which encouraged them to stay and continue long-held traditions. The language is now explicitly protected by an Italian presidential decree and a federal law. Further, a regional law passed by the government in Aosta requires educators to promote knowledge of Franco-Provençal language and culture in the school curriculum. Several cultural groups, libraries, and theatre companies are fostering a sense of ethnic pride with their active use of the Valdôtain dialect as well (EUROPA, 2005).|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} for a Connecticut borough or Vermont village to become a city. In Connecticut, cities overlay towns just as boroughs do, and, just like a borough, a city can cover {{only a portion of}} a town rather than being coextensive with the town. This is rare today—only one or two examples remain—but it was more common in the past. At least one borough historically spanned more than one town: the borough of Danielsonville originally laid over parts of Killingly and Brooklyn, until the Brooklyn portion petitioned to be reorganized as a fire district and concurrently the Killingly portion was renamed Danielson by the General Assembly. There are no legal restrictions in Connecticut that would prevent a city or borough today from similarly overlaying the territory of more than one town, provided it is not consolidated with one of the underlying towns. Cities actually developed earlier in Connecticut than in the other New England states, and were originally based on the borough concept. At one time, all cities were non-coextensive; the practice of making cities coextensive with their towns was a later adaptation intended to mimic the city concept that had emerged in the other New England states. Over time, many non-coextensive cities have expanded to become coextensive with their parent town. As with boroughs, many have also disincorporated and reverted to full town control. These two trends <b>have</b> <b>combined</b> <b>to</b> make non-coextensive cities very rare in recent times.|$|E

500|$|Canada's {{culture is}} a product of its [...] ethnicities, languages, religions, {{political}} and legal system(s). Canada has been shaped by waves of migration that <b>have</b> <b>combined</b> <b>to</b> form a unique blend of art, cuisine, literature, humour, and music. Today, Canada has a diverse makeup of nationalities and constitutional protection for policies that promote multiculturalism rather than cultural assimilation. In Quebec, cultural identity is strong, and many French-speaking commentators speak of a Quebec culture distinct from English Canadian culture. However, as a whole, Canada is a cultural mosaic: a collection of several regional, indigenous, and ethnic subcultures.|$|E

A few days after writing this, Fuller, Ossoli, and their child began a five-week return voyage to the United States aboard the ship Elizabeth, an American merchant freighter carrying cargo that included mostly marble from Carrara. They set sail on May 17. At sea, the ship's captain, Seth Hasty, died of smallpox. Angelino contracted the disease and recovered.|$|E
