5|$|In {{standardized}} tests, if {{a question}} asks about {{the behavior of}} even numbers, it might be necessary {{to keep in mind}} that zero <b>is</b> <b>even.</b> Official publications relating to the GMAT and GRE tests both state that 0 <b>is</b> <b>even.</b>|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to explain why zero <b>is</b> <b>even</b> without referring to formal definitions. The following explanations {{make sense of the}} idea that zero <b>is</b> <b>even</b> in terms of fundamental number concepts. From this foundation, one can provide a rationale for the definition itself—and its applicability to zero.|$|E
5|$|There {{is another}} {{concrete}} definition of evenness: if {{the objects in}} a set can be placed into two groups of equal size, then the number of objects <b>is</b> <b>even.</b> This definition {{is equivalent to the}} first one. Again, zero <b>is</b> <b>even</b> because the empty set can be divided into two groups of zero items each.|$|E

5|$|Government in Ratanakiri is weak, {{largely due}} to the province's remoteness, ethnic diversity, and recent history of Khmer Rouge dominance. The provincial legal {{framework}} is poor, {{and the rule of law}} <b>is</b> <b>even</b> weaker in Ratanakiri than elsewhere in Cambodia. Furthermore, government services are ineffective and insufficient to meet the needs of the province. The Cambodian government has traditionally accepted substantial support from NGOs in the region.|$|E
5|$|In graph theory, a {{bipartite graph}} is a graph whose {{vertices}} are {{split into two}} colors, such that neighboring vertices have different colors. If a connected graph has no odd cycles, then a bipartition can be constructed by choosing a base vertex v and coloring every vertex black or white, depending on whether its distance from v <b>is</b> <b>even</b> or odd. Since the distance between v and itself is 0, and 0 <b>is</b> <b>even,</b> the base vertex is colored differently from its neighbors, which lie {{at a distance of}} 1.|$|E

5|$|Many HIV-positive {{people are}} unaware {{that they are}} {{infected}} with the virus. For example, in 2001 less than 1% of the sexually active urban population in Africa had been tested, and this proportion <b>is</b> <b>even</b> lower in rural populations. Furthermore, in 2001 only 0.5% of pregnant women attending urban health facilities were counselled, tested or receive their test results. Again, this proportion <b>is</b> <b>even</b> lower in rural health facilities. Since donors may therefore be unaware of their infection, donor blood and blood products used in medicine and medical research are routinely screened for HIV.|$|E

5|$|Process {{philosophy}} <b>is</b> <b>even</b> {{more difficult}} to pin down than process theology. In practice, the two fields cannot be neatly separated. The 32-volume State University of New York series in constructive postmodern thought edited by process philosopher and theologian David Ray Griffin displays the range of areas in which different process philosophers work, including physics, ecology, medicine, public policy, nonviolence, politics, and psychology.|$|E
5|$|The classic {{point in}} polygon test from {{computational}} geometry applies the above ideas. To {{determine if a}} point lies within a polygon, one casts a ray from infinity to the point and counts {{the number of times}} the ray crosses the edge of polygon. The crossing number <b>is</b> <b>even</b> if and only if the point is outside the polygon. This algorithm works because if the ray never crosses the polygon, then its crossing number is zero, which <b>is</b> <b>even,</b> and the point is outside. Every time the ray does cross the polygon, the crossing number alternates between even and odd, and the point at its tip alternates between outside and inside.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} German {{versions}} of Gilbert and Sullivan operas, including the popular Der Mikado. There <b>is</b> <b>even</b> a German version of The Grand Duke. Some German translations {{were made by}} Friedrich Zell and Richard Genée, librettists of Die Fledermaus and other Viennese operettas, who even translated one of Sullivan's lesser-known operas, The Chieftain, as (Der Häuptling).|$|E

30|$|If f(n− 1) + n = a(n− 1) + n − b is odd, {{then we have}} “a is odd and b is even” or “ a,b <b>are</b> <b>even</b> and n <b>is</b> odd” or “ a,n <b>are</b> <b>even</b> and b <b>is</b> odd”.|$|R
50|$|Finally, it {{was decided}} (after {{receiving}} over 700 entries) that the winner was a certain A. Kollmann from Salzburg.

5|$|These {{ideas can}} be {{illustrated}} by drawing objects in pairs. It {{is difficult to}} depict zero groups of two, or to emphasize the nonexistence of a leftover object, so it helps to draw other groupings and to compare them with zero. For example, {{in the group of}} five objects, there are two pairs. More importantly, there is a leftover object, so 5 is odd. In the group of four objects, there is no leftover object, so 4 <b>is</b> <b>even.</b> In the group of just one object, there are no pairs, and there is a leftover object, so 1 is odd. In the group of zero objects, there is no leftover object, so 0 <b>is</b> <b>even.</b>|$|E

30|$|Actually, g may be {{identified}} with analytic functions which <b>are</b> <b>even</b> on x∈R, periodic in x, and quasi-periodic in t. However, equation (1) is defined on x∈[0,π]. So we put forward the hypothesis (H_ 3) so that g(ω t,·) can <b>be</b> <b>even</b> expanded on R analytically.|$|R
5|$|Zero is a number, {{and numbers}} {{are used for}} counting. Given a set of objects, one uses a number to {{describe}} how many objects are in the set. Zero is the count of no objects; in more formal terms, it {{is the number of}} objects in the empty set. The concept of parity is used for making groups of two objects. If the objects in a set can be marked off into groups of two, with none left over, then the number of objects <b>is</b> <b>even.</b> If an object is left over, then the number of objects is odd. The empty set contains zero groups of two, and no object is left over from this grouping, so zero <b>is</b> <b>even.</b>|$|E
5|$|About 10,000years ago {{the humans}} who {{inhabited}} the lands around the Mediterranean basin began to domesticate wild animals. Pigs, cattle, goats, sheep, horses, camels, {{cats and dogs}} were all kept and bred in captivity. These animals would have brought their viruses with them. The transmission of viruses from animals to humans can occur, but such zoonotic infections are rare and subsequent human-to-human transmission of animal viruses <b>is</b> <b>even</b> rarer, although there are notable exceptions such as influenza. Most viruses are species-specific and would have posed no threat to humans. The rare epidemics of viral diseases originating in animals would have been short-lived because the viruses were not fully adapted to humans and the human populations were too small to maintain the chains of infection.|$|E
5|$|Adults who {{do believe}} that zero <b>is</b> <b>even</b> can {{nevertheless}} be unfamiliar with thinking of it as even, enough so to measurably slow them down in a reaction time experiment. Stanislas Dehaene, {{a pioneer in the}} field of numerical cognition, led a series of such experiments in the early 1990s. A numeral or a number word is flashed to the subject on a monitor, and a computer records the time it takes the subject to push one of two buttons to identify the number as odd or even. The results showed that 0 was slower to process than other even numbers. Some variations of the experiment found delays as long as 60 milliseconds or about 10% of the average reaction time—a small difference but a significant one.|$|E
