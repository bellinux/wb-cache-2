It includes a brief survey of previous studies devoted {{to the effect of}} co-processing on FCC products yield and quality. A combination of two main processes is proposed to account for the marked increase in coke formation in the presence of oxygenated molecules in the reacting feed: (i) the conventional cracking route for the VGO fossil hydrocarbons leading to essentially graphitic coke deposited preferentially in the USY zeolite micropores, and (ii) the conversion of lignin fragments into hydrocarbons, residual light oxygenates (essentially phenolic type) and finally "bio-coke" which accumulates in mesopores as less structured coke as compared to the <b>harder</b> <b>coke</b> issued from hydrocarbons condensation. These two routes which are monitored by the catalysts structure, texture and acidity are strongly interacting via hydrogen transfer between light hydrocarbons and phenolic type fragments.

40|$|Tests {{have been}} {{conducted}} in a microactivity test (MAT) and a fluidized bed reactor to develop an experimental protocol {{to determine how the}} yield and composition of coke and the associated catalyst surface area vary as a function of stripper conditions in fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). In both reactors, the use of rapid quenching has allowed the relatively short stripping times encountered in FCC units to be simulated. Low sulphur vacuum gas oils (VGO) with a low metal equilibrium catalyst (E-cat) were used for stripping periods of up to 20 minutes. Significant variations occur in the structure of both hard and soft coke during stripping. Although the <b>hard</b> <b>coke</b> becomes more highly condensed with prolonged stripping, the surface area reduction by the <b>hard</b> <b>coke</b> remains fairly constant for stripping periods in excess of ca. 5 - 10 minutes and is small (10 m 2 g- 1) in relation to the loss of surface area from the soft coke. The use of about 70 g of catalyst in the fluidized bed provides sufficient sample for demineralization to recover sufficient of the <b>hard</b> <b>coke</b> for 13 C NMR analysis after the initial extraction of the soft coke. Indeed, it has been found that a further pool of soft (chloroform soluble) coke is physically entrapped within the catalyst pore structure and is only released after demineralization. In fact, this second soft coke fraction is much more highly aromatic than the first and ultimately controls the final coke yield. For the combination of E-cat and VGOs investigated here, typically about half of the final <b>hard</b> <b>coke</b> content of nearly 1 % w/w catalyst is derived from this second soft coke fraction by carbonization. The structural information obtained has been used to formulate a model for the stripping process where the soft coke II fraction undergoes cracking in competition with coke formation and evaporative removal from the catalyst...|$|E

No significant structural change was noted for the solids due to the dopants except for barium, which decreased the specific surface area, due to the partial blockage of the zeolite channels by the large size ions. However, a decrease was noted for all samples due to platinum, which partially blocked the zeolite channels. Barium also decreased the crystallinity while platinum caused this effect only for calcium and barium-containing samples, due to the structure partial collapse. Metallic platinum species in several electronic states were detected in the cages of zeolite, barium-containing catalyst showing the most electron-enriched platinum atoms. The amount of Lewis and Brønsted acid sites increased due to magnesium and calcium but barium increased only the amount of Lewis acid sites, as compared to potassium-containing solid. The catalysts with magnesium and barium showed the same platinum dispersion, which was higher than the one containing calcium. All catalysts were active in n-octane reforming at 723 K and selective to ethylbenzene, but the conversion dropped with time reaction due to the decrease of specific surface area and to coke deposition. The calcium-containing sample produced the <b>hardest</b> <b>coke,</b> {{which led to the}} highest drop in conversion. The n-octane conversion was supposed to occur by a monofunctional mechanism but the bifunctional mechanism also seemed to occur due to the residual acidity of the catalysts.

At low temperature, these products are mainly olefins from C- 3 (-) to C- 13 (-), with a predominance of dimeric products. The analysis of the product stream obtained by the reaction of n-butenes over several materials with MFI topology, but with different aluminum content provides evidence for an oligomerization-cracking-realkylation mechanism. The reactions occur predominantly in the catalyst bulk or at the external surface, depending {{on the amount of}} coke developed inside the catalyst. This behavior is determined by the concentration of framework Al and associated silanol groups, inducing coking. For Al-rich MFI samples, the amount of <b>hard</b> <b>coke</b> is sufficient to block the access of reactants to internal acid sites.

However, the negative effect of the presence of extra-framework Al species (EFAL) could be expected to be lower in 320 HOA USY due to the pore blockage effect, especially in the polymeric species [24], such that the coke content can be trapped within the pores since these will be smaller than those found for USY-A.|$|E

40|$|The {{contribution}} {{deals with}} the preparation of small-diameter briquettes {{on the basis of}} desintegrated phyto-materials and the admixture of coal and coke. The phyto-materials are classified as a dry biomass that can be, on the one hand, the wastes from wood-working industry,(sawdust, chips, bark, etc.) or dried mass from the plant production and, on the other hand, the mass of quick-growing plants cultivated on special plantations. In present time this renewable energy resource attracts attention by its heating value ranging from 10 to 16 MJ. kg- 1 (EkoWATT, 2001), a low ash content of 0. 5  6. 5 % and by a low sulphur content in a water free sample of 0. 05  0. 12 %. As a phyto-material the spruce sawdusts having a grain size of  2 mm were used. The admixture of brown coal, <b>hard</b> coal and <b>coke</b> with a grain size of 0. 040 mm was added to the sawdust and in such way prepared mixtures were subjected to briquetting with the aim to obtain small-diameter briquettes. The influence of admixtures amount on the density, and the suitable briquetting press have been studied. A saleability of briquettes on the basis of phyto-materials is conditioned by their density that must be higher than 1, 000 kg. m- 3. Thus, an adding of denser material with a relatively high calorific value would enable to attain the required density as well as to retain and/or to improve the main utility properties, i. e. calorific value and ash content. The adding evinces itself in an enhancement of briquetting press, but also density of obtained briquettes is often much higher that required by the market. It was showed {{that in the case of}} clear spruce sawdust the density of 1, 059 kg. m- 3 under the briquetting press of 250 MPa can be attained. According to other results, an admixture of brown coal is not very favourable because briquetting press exceeds the value of 300 MPa. As to hard coal adding, the presses under 250 MPa were achieved at the content of 25  30 %. The density of these briquettes ranges from 1, 050  1, 085 kg. m- 3. The best results have been obtained by adding coke. The briquetting press lower than 250 MPa has already been attained at the coke content of 15 %.

40|$|Pyrolysis {{gasoline}} (PyGas) is {{a by-product}} of high temperature naphtha cracking during ethylene and propylene production. It is a high octane number mixture which contains aromatics, olefins and paraffins ranging from C 5 s to C 12 s. PyGas has high potential {{for use as a}} gasoline blending mixture and/or as a source of aromatics. Currently, PyGas is generally used as a gasoline blending mixture due to its high octane number, but global production of PyGas is very high and further increases are anticipated in the future due to higher demands for ethylene and propylene. However, current strict fuel regulations for aromatic content make PyGas utilisation as a blending mixture more difficult, therefore a useful avenue for PyGas consumption is desired. Catalytic hydrogenation of PyGas is an important industrial and academic research area for the stabilisation, upgrading and utilisation of PyGas. Limited work has been performed on the hydrogenation of PyGas and an incomplete picture of the process has been obtained. The composition of PyGas is very complex and therefore most of the studies have been carried out with single compounds or a mixture of a few model compounds for simplicity and generality. However, the single model compound cannot be representive of the entire PyGas hydrogenation process. Furthermore, the behaviour of these compounds is generally different in mixtures than as individual compounds. Hence, the hydrogenation of a PyGas, which contained styrene, toluene, 1 -octene, cyclopentene, heptane, decane and 1, 3 -pentadiene/ 1 -pentene, was investigated over alumina supported nickel and palladium catalysts. This is a comprehensive model for the broader groups of hydrocarbons present in PyGas. The aim of the work was to investigate the effect of reaction parameters such as reaction temperature, total reaction pressure, hydrogen partial pressure and WHSV of PyGas on the hydrogenation of PyGas. Different strategies were proposed for PyGas consumption to obtain; (i) a high octane number gasoline blend, (ii) an aromatic source mixture and (iii) hydrogenation of surplus aromatics present in PyGas. These desired products were achieved during PyGas hydrogenation over both the nickel and palladium catalysts by using different reaction conditions. However, the palladium catalyst was found to be preferable for the selective hydrogenation of reactive species such as styrene, diolefins and for the isomerisation of olefins, without the hydrogenation of aromatics during PyGas hydrogenation at mild reaction temperatures. However, surplus aromatics hydrogenation can be achieved over the palladium catalyst with an increase in reaction temperature. Conversely, a greater amount of aromatics saturation was observed during PyGas hydrogenation over the nickel catalyst. Therefore the nickel catalyst was found to be preferable when aromatic ring saturation is desired during PyGas hydrogenation. The selective hydrogenation of PyGas without aromatics saturation was achieved over a nickel catalyst when using a low hydrogen partial pressure. The kinetics of PyGas hydrogenation were also investigated for {{a better understanding of the}} process. The apparent orders for hydrogenation /isomerisation of the PyGas components were investigated by using an empirical rate equation. During PyGas hydrogenation, first order (1. 1 to 1. 6) kinetics were observed for the hydrogenation of olefins to their respective paraffins over both the nickel and palladium catalysts with an increase in hydrogen partial pressure, which became zero or negative order kinetics when sufficient amounts of hydrogen were available on the surface of the catalyst. Negative order kinetics were observed for olefin isomerisation to internal olefin with an increase in hydrogen partial pressure. Meanwhile the hydrogenation of styrene to ethylbenzene followed zero order kinetics with respect to hydrogen over both catalysts due to the strong adsorption of styrene onto the catalyst. Third order kinetics were observed for aromatics hydrogenation over both catalysts. On the other hand, the hydrogenation of olefins to paraffins followed zero to negative order (0 to - 0. 7) kinetics, whilst positive order (1. 6 to 3. 6) kinetics were observed for isomerisation of olefins to internal olefins with respect to PyGas. Moreover, positive order (0. 7 to 1. 0) kinetics were observed for styrene hydrogenation to ethylbenzene with respect to PyGas. The hydrogenation of aromatics followed negative orders kinetics with respect to PyGas over both catalysts due to competitive hydrogenation of the olefinic and aromatic components. Coke deposition is believed to be the main reason for catalyst deactivation during the PyGas hydrogenation reaction. The amount and nature of the coke deposited was investigated by in-situ temperature programmed oxidation (TPO). The increase in reaction temperature not only increased the amount of coke deposition but also produced more condensed hydrogen deficient type coke. Conversely, the carbon laydown decreased with an increase in hydrogen partial pressure. Larger amounts of coke deposition took place over the nickel catalyst when compared to the coke deposited over the palladium catalyst under identical reaction conditions. Moreover, a soft type coke (with lower C/H ratio) was deposited over the palladium catalyst, while a comparatively <b>hard</b> type <b>coke</b> (with higher C/H ratio) was deposited over the nickel catalyst. Both the nickel and palladium catalysts used during PyGas hydrogenation were effectively regenerated by in-situ TPO with no significant loss to their catalytic properties.

Nevertheless, nPt/nA ratio was found to be within the optimum balance limits of 0.03 and 0.17 (0.03  ≤ nPt/nA ≤  0.17) for the most catalysts, which may reflect the great dehydrogenation–hydrogenation function capacity of platinum even at the lower contents [40, 41, 44]. The average <b>hard</b> <b>coke</b> contents were found to be in the range of 0.1 – 0.2  wt% for all the catalysts except that containing 1  wt% platinum, for which the coke content was about 0.7  wt%, which may due to the effect of the longer TOS when compared with the other catalysts.|$|E

Base-desilicated mesoporous and bulk HZSM- 5 zeolites with comparable Brønsted acidity were employed as acidic supports. Mo loading was optimized to minimize loss of acidity. Surface silylation of Mo/HZSM- 5 resulted in improved Mo-oxide dispersion. More intensive silylation led to decreased Mo-oxide dispersion because of increased hydrophobicity. High methane conversion rates were associated with small Mo-oxide precursor particles. Silylation of the external surface of Mo/HZSM- 5 led to higher methane conversion and less coke formation.

40|$|The {{catalytic}} conversion of hydrocarbons over zeolites {{has been applied}} in large scale petroleum-refining processes. However, there is always formation and retention of heavy by-products, called coke, which causes catalyst deactivation. This deactivation {{is due to the}} poisoning of the acid sites and/or pore blockage. The formation of coke on hydrocarbon processing catalysts is of considerable technological and economic importance {{and a great deal of}} work has been carried out to this study. The main aim of this work is to understand the deactivation of zeolite catalysts as a result of coke deposition. The deactivation by coke of USHY zeolite was investigated during {{catalytic conversion}} of hydrocarbons – 1 -pentene, n-heptane and ethylbenzene – as representatives of olefins, paraffins and aromatics respectively, at different reaction temperatures, time-on-streams and composition. Three novel techniques, coke classification, thermogravimetric method for characterising coke precursors and indirect temperature programmed desorption (TPD) for catalyst acid sites characterisation were developed to further study catalyst deactivation mechanism. Product distribution, coke formation, characterisation of coke precursors, as well as the role of strong acid sites on hydrocarbon reactions are presented and discussed. During catalytic reactions of 1 -pentene over USHY zeolite, cracking and hydride transfer were the predominant reactions in initial stage which deactivated rapidly allowing isomerisation to become the main reaction afterwards. Deactivation studies showed that coke formation was very strong initially which is in good correlation with the initial rapid deactivation. The hydrogen freed during this initial time from the formation of high C/H ratio coke components contributed to the formation of hydride transfer products. The amount of coke precursors decrease with increasing reaction temperature due to the higher desorption of coke precursors into gas phase while <b>hard</b> <b>coke</b> amount increased with temperature as expected from an activated process. The coke amount formed was not proportional to the reactant feed composition, because of a strong pseudo-zeroth- order initial coking on strong acidic sites. The thermogravimetric method provides insight into the chemical character of coke precursor components in terms of the mode of their removal and allows further classification of coke precursors into small and large coke precursors. The concentration and strength of acid sites of coked catalysts were studied by the TPD methodology. Besides, characterisation of coke precursors was also revealed. The initial deactivation preferentially on strong acid sites is very fast. The concentration of free acid sites is inversely correlated well with the total concentration of coke rather than individual coke groups. Coke precursors tend to be more stable at higher reaction temperatures. Furthermore, by selectively poisoning strong acid sites of USHY zeolite, it shows conclusively that strong acid sites are responsible for cracking and hydride transfer reactions as well as strong coke formation while weak acid sites can only catalyse double bond isomerisation. ...|$|E
40|$|Combustion {{assisted}} {{gravity drainage}} (CAGD) is an integrated horizontal well air injection process for recovery and upgrading of heavy oil and bitumen from tar sands. Short-distance air injection and direct mobilized oil production {{are the main}} features of this process that lead to stable sweep and high oil recovery. These characteristics identify the CAGD process as a high-potential oil recovery method either in primary production or as a follow-up process in reservoirs that have been partially depleted. The CAGD process combines the advantages of both gravity drainage and conventional in-situ combustion (ISC). A combustion chamber develops in a wide area in the reservoir around the horizontal injector and consists of flue gases, injected air, and mobilized oil. Gravity drainage is the main mechanism for mobilized oil production and extraction of flue gases from the reservoir. A 3 D laboratory cell with dimensions of 0. 62 m, 0. 41 m, and 0. 15 m was designed and constructed to study the CAGD process. The combustion cell was fitted with 48 thermocouples. A horizontal producer was placed near {{the base of the}} model and a parallel horizontal injector in the upper part at a distance of 0. 13 m. Peace River heavy oil and Athabasca bitumen were used in these experiments. Experimental results showed that oil displacement occurs mainly by gravity drainage. Vigorous oxidation reactions were observed at the early stages near the heel of the injection well, where peak temperatures of about 550 ?C to 690 ?C were recorded. Produced oil from CAGD was upgraded by 6 and 2 ?API for Peace River heavy oil and Athabasca bitumen respectively. Steady O 2 consumption for both oil samples confirmed the stability of the process. Experimental data showed that the distance between horizontal injection and production wells is very critical. Close vertical spacing has negative effect on the process as coke deposits plug the production well and stop the process prematurely. CAGD was also laboratory tested as a follow-up process. For this reason, air was injected through dual parallel wells in a mature steam chamber. Laboratory results showed that the process can effectively create self-sustained combustion front in the previously steam-operated porous media. A maximum temperature of 617 ?C was recorded, with cumulative oil recovery of 12 % of original oil in place (OOIP). Post-experiment sand pack analysis indicated that in addition to sweeping the residual oil in the steam chamber, the combustion process created a <b>hard</b> <b>coke</b> shell around the boundaries. This hard shell isolated the steam chamber from the surrounding porous media and reduced the steam leakage. A thermal simulator was used for history matching the laboratory data while capturing the main production mechanisms. Numerical analysis showed very good agreement between predicted and experimental results in terms of fluid production rate, combustion temperature and produced gas composition. The validated simulation model was used to compare the performance of the CAGD process to other practiced thermal recovery methods like steam assistance gravity drainage (SAGD) and toe to heel air injection (THAI). Laboratory results showed that CAGD has the lowest cumulative energy-to-oil ratio while its oil production rate is comparable to SAGD...|$|E
