5|$|Meher Baba gave {{numerous}} teachings on {{the cause}} and purpose of life, including teaching reincarnation and that the phenomenal world is an illusion. He taught that the Universe is imagination, that God <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>really</b> exists, and that each soul is really God passing through imagination to realize individually His own divinity. In addition he gave practical advice for the aspirant who wishes to attain Self-realization and thereby escape the wheel of births and deaths. He also taught about the concept of Perfect Masters, the Avatar, and those on the various stages of the spiritual path that he called involution. His teachings are most importantly recorded in his principal books Discourses and God Speaks.|$|E

Marco Torres of the Houston Press saw similarities between the song's lyrics and Selena and Pérez's relationship; her father and manager, Abraham Quintanilla, Jr., discouraged their romance before he accepted it. Its lyrics allude to female teenagers' [...] "trouble" [...] partners and parents who forbid their relationship.|$|E

As well as motorsport, the FIA's remit includes the interests of motorists worldwide, an area in which Mosley wanted to involve himself: [...] "That <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>really</b> interested me: [...] you maybe save one life every five years, whereas [...] road safety you are talking about thousands of lives". A challenge to Mosley's election by Jeffrey Rose, chairman of the British Royal Automobile Club, was withdrawn {{when it became clear that}} the majority of voters were already committed to Mosley.

500|$|Silence is {{considered}} a [...] "passion project" [...] of Scorsese's {{and has been in}} development since 1990, two years after the release of Scorsese's most controversial film, The Last Temptation of Christ, which also carried strongly religious themes. Scorsese first read the novel in 1989 and obtained the movie rights soon afterwards. When asked why he retained interest in the project for over 26 years, Scorsese stated: [...] "As you get older, ideas go and come. Questions, answers, loss of the answer again and more questions, and this <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>really</b> interests me. Yes, the cinema and the people in my life and my family are most important, but ultimately as you get older, there's got to be more... Silence is just something that I'm drawn to in that way. It's been an obsession, it has to be done... it's a strong, wonderful true story, a thriller in a way, but it deals with those questions." ...|$|E

Apparently it all came flooding back to him, he was reliving the whole trip! He was yelling out and jumping on his seat like it was a roller coaster, ducking and diving, shouting 'SHIT! LOOK OUT! GODDAMN BATS!' That was fantastic – if he thought we'd captured it, then we must have done it!" [...] Thompson himself stated, [...] "Yeah, I liked it. It's not my show, but I appreciated it.

2500|$|The two met in {{the semifinals}} of the 1998 US Open, where Sampras was slowed in the third set by a leg injury {{and called for a}} trainer, and Rafter broke Sampras twice in the {{deciding}} fifth set. [...] Sampras's loss denied him the chance to match two records—Jimmy Connors' mark of five U.S. Open titles and Roy Emerson's record of 12 Grand Slam singles titles. Sampras cited a leg injury as the reason Rafter won, an attitude that upset the Australian: [...] "He really does say some funny things at the wrong time", said Rafter, [...] "We are out there busting our guts and he doesn't show a lot of respect {{at the end of the}} day. He tries to play down the reason why he lost, giving no respect to the other player, and that <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>really</b> upsets me about him and the reason I try to piss him off as much as I can." [...] Following Rafter's successful defense of his 1997 U.S. Open title by defeating Mark Philippoussis in the 1998 final, when asked about Sampras' earlier comments about having to win another Grand Slam in order to be considered great, Rafter replied: [...] "Maybe you can ask him that question, if he thinks that now. For me, I won another Slam, and it hasn't sunk in yet. It's very, very exciting for me, especially to repeat it". For his part, Sampras said about Rafter, [...] "When I see him holding the US Open trophy, it pisses me off." [...] Rafter responded by calling Sampras a “cry baby” and saying that it would be better for tennis if someone besides the American were No. 1.|$|E

He was eminently fit to appreciate the mental image he made for himself of the Capataz, after hours of tension and anxiety, precipitated suddenly into an abyss of waters and darkness, without earth or sky, and confronting it not only with an undismayed mind, but with sensible success. Of course, the man was an incomparable swimmer, that was known, but the doctor judged that this instance testified to a still greater intrepidity of spirit. It was pleasing to him; he augured well from it for the success of the arduous mission with which he meant to entrust the Capataz so marvellously restored to usefulness. And in a tone vaguely gratified, he observed-- ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{advantage}} of [...] "divine right," [...] or irremovable legitimacy, is this; {{that there is}} a limit to the ambitions of the rich. [...] "Roi ne puis"; the royal power, whether it was or was not the power of heaven, was in one respect like the power of heaven. It was not for sale. Constitutional moralists have often implied that a tyrant and a rabble have the same vices. It has perhaps been less noticed that a tyrant and a rabble most emphatically have the same virtues. And one virtue which they very markedly share is that neither tyrants nor rabbles are snobs; they do not care a button what they do to wealthy people. It is true that tyranny was sometimes treated as coming from the heavens almost in the lesser and more literal sense of coming from the sky; a man no more expected to be the king than to be the west wind or the morning star. But at least no wicked miller can chain the wind to turn only his own mill; no pedantic scholar can trim the morning star to be his own reading-lamp. Yet something very like this <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>really</b> happened to England in the later Middle Ages; and the first sign of it, I fancy, was the fall of Richard II.|$|E

6000|$|There {{were a few}} who {{understood}} their real interests, like the old Premier-President Mathieu Mole, and these hoped that by standing {{between the two parties}} they might get the only right thing done, namely, to convoke the States-General, which <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>really</b> answers to our own English Parliament. People could do things then in Paris they never dream of now; and Clement Darpent worked hard, getting up meetings among the younger counsellors and advocates, and some of the magistrates, where they made speeches about constitutional liberty, and talked about Ciecero, who was always Clement's favourite hero. My brother went to hear him sometimes, and said he had a great gift of eloquence, but that he was embarked on a very dangerous course. Moreover, M. Darpent had been chosen as a deputy of the Town Council at the Hotel de Ville. This council consisted of the mayor and echevins, as they called them, who were something like our aldermen, all the parish priests, deputies from the trades, and from all the sixteen quarters of the city, and more besides. They had the management of the affairs of the city in their hands, and Clement Darpent, owning a house, and being respected by the respectable citizens of his department of St. Antoine, was chosen to represent it. Thus he felt himself of use, which always rejoiced him. As to me, I only saw him once that whole autumn, and then I met him by accident as I was walking with Eustace and Margaret in the Cours de la Reine. [footnote: the Champs-Elysees] ...|$|E
6000|$|Presenting {{himself at}} Buckingham Crescent {{three days after}} the Sunday spent at Mertle, Vanderbank found Lady Fanny Cashmore in the act of taking leave of Mrs. Brook and found Mrs. Brook herself in the state of muffled exaltation that was the mark of all her intercourse--and most of all perhaps of her farewells--with Lady Fanny. This splendid {{creature}} gave out, as it were, so little that Vanderbank was freshly struck with all Mrs. Brook could take in, though nothing, for that matter, in Buckingham Crescent, had been more fully formulated on behalf of the famous beauty than the imperturbable grandeur of her almost total absence of articulation. Every aspect of the phenomenon had been freely discussed there and endless ingenuity lavished on the question of how exactly it was that so much of what the world would in another case have called complete stupidity could be kept by a mere wonderful face from boring one to death. It was Mrs. Brook who, in this relation as in many others, had arrived at the supreme expression of the law, had thrown off, happily enough, to whomever it might have concerned: [...] "My dear thing, it all comes back, as everything always does, simply to personal pluck. It's only a question, no matter when or where, of having enough. Lady Fanny has the courage of all her silence--so much therefore that it sees her completely through and <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>really</b> makes her interesting. Not to be afraid of what may happen to you when you've no more to say for yourself than a steamer without a light--that truly is the highest heroism, and Lady Fanny's greatness is that she's never afraid. She takes the risk every time she goes out--takes, as you may say, her life in her hand. She just turns that glorious mask upon you and practically says: 'No, I won't open my lips--to call it really open--for the forty minutes I shall stay; but I calmly defy you, all the same, to kill me for it.' And we don't kill her--we delight in her; though when either of us watches her in a circle of others it's like seeing a very large blind person in the middle of Oxford Street. One fairly looks about for the police." [...] Vanderbank, before his fellow visitor withdrew it, had the benefit of the glorious mask and could scarce have failed to be amused at the manner in which Mrs. Brook alone showed the stress of thought. Lady Fanny, in the other scale, sat aloft and Olympian, so that though visibly much had happened between the two ladies it had all happened only to the hostess. The sense in the air in short was just of Lady Fanny herself, who came to an end like a banquet or a procession. Mrs. Brook left the room with her and, on coming back, was full of it. [...] "She'll go, she'll go!" ...|$|E
