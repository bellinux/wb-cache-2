40|$|The {{ultimate}} {{purpose of}} nuclear power plant safety systems is to prevent damage to the reactor and the possible release of radioactive materials into the surroundings following an internal or external event that interrupts normal power plant operation. Different design principles have been developed and they are incorporated to the safety design {{to ensure the safety}} functions are performed even if some components or whole systems fail to function as intended. Many nuclear power plant safety systems rely on electrical power to operate. Following a loss of off-site power accident, the power plant electrical systems are supplied by the <b>emergency</b> <b>power</b> sources. Station blackout generators constitute an alternative source for AC power designed for situations where all the main emergency diesel generators a fail to function in accident conditions. To introduce diversity into the <b>emergency</b> <b>power</b> sources, gas turbine generator units are proposed to be used instead of diesel generators as station blackout power sources.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Development and Management Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. Energy {{is central}} to {{economic}} development. It has been established {{that there is a}} clear correlation between energy consumption and living standards. Nigeria is a country of very industrious and enterprising people. However, due to non availability of adequate energy in the country, especially in the remote, off grid locations, the entrepreneurial inclination of the average Nigerian living in these locations has been largely stunted. Over the years, successive governments in the country, in realisation of the pivotal role of energy in national development, have explored various options to improve energy supply and availability, but the situation has not experienced any remarkable improvement. This has forced many businesses and households to resort to self provision through generators, often at exorbitant costs. This research work addresses the challenge of energy in remote, off grid locations by appraising the techno economic potential of renewable energy, using Obudu Ranch as a case study. This ranch is the foremost tourism resort in Nigeria, and has played host to a number of international events over the years. Presently, electricity is being generated through the use of diesel <b>powered</b> <b>generating</b> <b>sets.</b> The adjoining communities are currently without electricity, although a few of the residents have acquired generators for self provision, mostly for their domestic use. Aside the high cost associated with this, the discharge of noxious contaminants into the atmosphere is undesirable. The research entailed a working collaboration with some notable Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs) that have done extensive ground work in the area for access to some secondary data, {{as well as a number}} of corporate and governmental agencies that are relevant to the study. Further, the ranch was visited to establish hands-on, the existing renewable energy sources. A trade-off of these sources was carried out with reference to a number of relevant evaluation parameters to identify the most suited option for addressing the energy challenge. A comparative analysis of this selected source was then made to establish its techno economic potential against the existing source of power generation- diesel <b>powered</b> <b>generating</b> <b>sets,</b> which currently costs R 1. 5 million annually in running expenses. The findings from this research have established that a Renewable Energy source (mini hydro) is a more cost effective option than the diesel powered gen set, providing a 43 % reduction in cost of energy generation, and a 42 % reduction in the life cycle cost over the five year of analysis, compared to the status quo. In addition, it is also more environmentally friendly. Conclusively, the findings and recommendations of this research effort, if well implemented, will be beneficial to the ranch, the adjoining communities and other relevant stakeholders. Master...|$|R

40|$|To assure safe {{shutdown}} {{of a nuclear}} power plant, there must always be reliable means of decay heat removal provided, in last resort, by an Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS). Currently the majority of nuclear power plants in the US utilize diesel generator <b>sets</b> as on-site <b>emergency</b> <b>power</b> <b>generating</b> units. In addition {{to the loss of}} off-site power, plants can lose their on-site AC power, a condition known as Station Blackout, which increases the calculated probability of reactor core damage significantly. This study evaluates how suitable fuel cell systems are today for improving back-up power performance on nuclear power plant sites and how suitable they can be projected to be by year 2030, when Generation IV reactors are planned to be deployed. The main system under consideration was the Gas Cooled Fast Reactor, due to its gas coolant and high power density, and therefore the need for an ultra-reliable shutdown cooling system. Fuel cells were identified as a preferred candidate because of their efficient continuous operability, and because most nuclear plants already have existing on-site hydrogen supply and storage systems. This study uses the operational data of 15 phosphoric acid fuel cells installed on U. S. Department of Defense bases starting in the year 1994 as the basis for assessment of currently proven technology. Analysis of data shows that the largest contributor to forced outages is the electrical subsystems and that the fuel cell stack operates with high reliability and availability throughout its lifetime. (cont.) Results underline important technical issues affecting the use of fuel cell systems on nuclear plant sites today and suggest that given the time frame for the deployment of Gen-IV reactors, improvements in the performance of electrical and support systems together with advances in hydrogen generation and storage, the potential of highly reliable fuel cell systems will be realized. by Derya Akkaynak.

The removal of petroleum hydrocarbons was highest in the 5. 00 % level of contamination where 55. 53 % of the petroleum hydrocarbons were removed. The least reduction in hydrocarbons was in the 10. 00 % level of contamination where only 35. 53 % of the hydrocarbons were removed. After the remediation the toxicity of the soils were tested by growing Zea mays in the treated soils. There was reduction in the toxicity of the soils treated with Pleurotus tuber-regium. Germination of {{the seeds of the}} test plant in treated 2. 50 and 5. 00 % diesel fuel contaminated substrates was higher than that in the control. Germination of seeds in the 10. 00 % diesel fuel contaminated substrates was less than that in the control. The continued growth of the plant in the treated soils however showed no significant difference between them and the control using leaf area, plant height, fresh weight, dry weight and root length indices. The formation of lateral roots was however adversely affected in the treated 10. 00 % contaminated soil only substrate. The fungus was able to reduce the toxicity of diesel fuel contaminated substrates when compared with control in which there was no remediation. Industrial relevance: Nigeria is an oil producing country with heavy or high reliance on diesel fuel for use in cars and electric <b>power</b> <b>generating</b> <b>sets.</b> The transportation of diesel fuel is by tankers and pipelines. There have been cases of spills which has adverse effect on the environment.

The assessment of the improvement of contaminated soil by the fungus is tested by using Zea mays easily obtained and cheaper too.
