6000|$|... "Pen, Pen, don't be so wicked!" [...] {{cried out}} the poor girl, hurt at the morbid perverseness and savage vanity of Pen. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>glaring</b> {{round in the}} {{direction}} of Mr. Pynsent as if {{he would have liked to}} engage that gentleman as he had done the cook. [...] "Who thinks the worse of you for stumbling in a waltz?" [...] If Laura does, we don't. [...] "Why are you so sensitive, and ready to think evil?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had turned}} out of Pall Mall into a side street, when whom should I strike against but her false swain! It was my fault, but I hit out at him savagely, as I always do when I run into anyone in the street. Then I looked at him. He was hollow-eyed; he was muddy; {{there was not a}} haw left in him. I never saw a more abject young man; he had not even the spirit to resent the testy stab I had given him with my umbrella. But this is the {{important}} thing: <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>glaring</b> wistfully at the post-office and thus in a twink I saw that he still adored my little governess. Whatever had been their quarrel he was as anxious to make it up as she, and perhaps he had been here every Thursday while she was round the corner in Pall Mall, each watching the post-office for an apparition. But from where they hovered neither could see the other.|$|E

5000|$|The 17 {{year old}} second prince, nicknamed [...] "The Glaring Prince". He has a {{reputation}} of being aloof and scary, and it's rumored that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{kicked out of the}} military academy for getting into brawls. As it turns out, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> suspended because <b>he</b> beat a student who bullied and abused his brother Bruno. He's actually a kindhearted, introverted young man who's bad at social interactions and likes cute things. He likes Heine because he's the first tutor to actually talk to him, and because he thinks of him as a cute pet. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> mistaken as scary because he has trouble speaking and often looks as if <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>glaring.</b> In the later chapters of the manga, Kai has returned to Military Academy and is currently away on a training trip.|$|R
60|$|Are we not all {{weary of}} him, that venerable impostor {{fresh from the}} steps of the Piazza di Spagna, who, in the leisure moments that he can spare from his {{customary}} organ, makes the round of the studios and is waited for in Holland Park? Do we not all recognise him, when, with the gay insouciance of his nation, he reappears on the walls of our summer exhibitions as everything that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not, and as nothing that <b>he</b> <b>is,</b> <b>glaring</b> at us here as a patriarch of Canaan, here beaming as a brigand from the Abruzzi? Popular <b>is</b> <b>he,</b> this poor peripatetic professor of posing, with those whose joy it is to paint the posthumous portrait of the last philanthropist who in his lifetime had neglected to <b>be</b> photographed,--yet <b>he</b> <b>is</b> the sign of the decadence, the symbol of decay.|$|R
6000|$|It {{happened}} {{when he was}} thirty-eight, {{for the first and}} only time in his life travelling on the Continent, with his twin-brother James and a man named Traquair. On the way from Germany to Venice, he had found himself at the Hotel Goldene Alp at Salzburg. It was late August, and weather for the gods: sunshine on the walls and the shadows of the vine-leaves, and at night, the moonlight, and again on the walls the shadows of the vine-leaves. Averse to the suggestions of other people, Swithin had refused to visit the Citadel; he had spent the day alone in the window of his bedroom, smoking a succession of cigars, and disparaging the appearance of the passers-by. After dinner he was driven by boredom into the streets. His chest puffed out like a pigeon's, and with something of a pigeon's cold and inquiring eye, he strutted, annoyed at the frequency of uniforms, which seemed to him both needless and offensive. His spleen rose at this crowd of foreigners, who spoke an unintelligible language, wore hair on their faces, and smoked bad tobacco. 'A queer lot!' he thought. The sound of music from a cafe attracted him; he walked in, vaguely moved by a wish for the distinction of adventure, without the trouble which adventure usually brought with it; spurred too, perhaps, by an after-dinner demon. The cafe was the bier-halle of the 'Fifties, with a door at either end, and lighted by a large wooden lantern. On a small dais three musicians were fiddling. Solitary men, or groups, sat at some dozen tables, and the waiters hurried about replenishing glasses; the air was thick with smoke. Swithin sat down. [...] "Wine!" [...] he said sternly. The astonished waiter brought him wine. Swithin pointed to a beer glass on the table. [...] "Here!" [...] he said, with the same ferocity. The waiter poured out the wine. 'Ah!' thought Swithin, 'they can understand if they like.' A group of officers close by were laughing; Swithin stared at them uneasily. A hollow cough sounded almost in his ear. To his left a man sat reading, with his elbows on the corners of a journal, and his gaunt shoulders raised almost to his eyes. He had a thin, long nose, broadening suddenly at the nostrils; a black-brown beard, spread in a savage fan over his chest; what was visible of the face was the colour of old parchment. A strange, wild, haughty-looking creature! Swithin observed his clothes with some displeasure--they were the clothes of a journalist or strolling actor. And yet he was impressed. This was singular. How could he be impressed by a fellow in such clothes! The man reached out a hand, covered with black hairs, and took up a tumbler that contained a dark-coloured fluid. 'Brandy!' thought Swithin. The crash of a falling chair startled him--his neighbour had risen. He was of immense height, and very thin; his great beard seemed to splash away from his mouth; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>glaring</b> at the group of officers, and speaking. Swithin made out two words: [...] "Hunde! Deutsche Hunde!" [...] 'Hounds! Dutch hounds!' he thought: 'Rather strong!' One of the officers had jumped up, and now drew his sword. The tall man swung his chair up, and brought it down with a thud. Everybody round started up and closed on him. The tall man cried out, [...] "To me, Magyars!" ...|$|E
60|$|He stopped short, for his striding around {{had brought}} him {{face to face with}} our friends. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> astonished, then <b>glared</b> at the three as if they were deadly enemies.|$|R
5000|$|Slyck - Slyck is {{the evil}} twin of Blob. His battle stance {{looks as if}} <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{breathing}} heavily. His eyes are yellow with green and his teeth <b>are</b> yellow. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> seen <b>glaring</b> with his mouth open with closed teeth. He turns into different objects than Blob, but they fight in a similar manner. When he wins, he glares and says [...] "I'm number one!".|$|R
60|$|Gavin {{returned}} to the fire and watched a girl in it in an officer's cloak playing at hide and seek with soldiers. After a time he sighed, then looked round sharply to see who had sighed, then, absent-mindedly, lifted the empty kettle {{and placed it on}} the glowing peats. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> standing <b>glaring</b> at the kettle, his arms folded, when Nanny returned from the well.|$|R
6000|$|Just {{then the}} Chief Steward rushed {{in with a}} sponge {{and a bowl of}} water, and began mopping away the broken eggs from his master's face. In a few minutes, and while all the party stood looking on, the King regained the use of his eyes, and the first thing <b>he</b> did <b>was</b> to <b>glare</b> wickedly upon the Scarecrow and exclaim: ...|$|R
60|$|We {{waited in}} silence for a minute--one of those minutes which one can never forget. Then the door opened and the man stepped in. In an instant Holmes clapped a pistol to his head, and Martin slipped the {{handcuffs}} over his wrists. It was all done so swiftly and deftly that the fellow <b>was</b> helpless before <b>he</b> knew that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> attacked. <b>He</b> <b>glared</b> {{from one to the other}} of us with a pair of blazing black eyes. Then he burst into a bitter laugh.|$|R
6000|$|His fear of {{shocking}} America was, I think, unfounded; at any rate, {{he succeeded}} in the necessary suppressions every time, and until {{the day of his}} death it was rare for the American press-cuttings that were removed in basketfuls almost daily with the other debris of his breakfast-table to speak of him in anything but quasi-amorous tones. He died for them the most spiritual as well as the most intellectual of men; [...] "not simply intellectual, but lovable." [...] They spoke of his pensive eyes, though, indeed, when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not <b>glaring</b> at a camera they were as pensive as champagne, and when the robust pathos bumped against the unavoidable humour as they were swept along the narrow torrent of his story they said with all the pleasure of an apt quotation that indeed in his wonderful heart laughter mingled with tears.|$|R
60|$|He {{knew his}} servant {{would soon be}} free, and would be glad. As yet, the soldier had held himself off from the elder man. The Captain grew madly irritable. He could not rest when the soldier was away, and when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> present, <b>he</b> <b>glared</b> at him with tormented eyes. He hated those fine, black brows over trie unmeaning, dark eyes, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> infuriated by the free {{movement}} of the handsome limbs, which no military discipline could make stiff. And he became harsh and cruelly bullying, using contempt and satire. The young soldier only grew more mute and expressionless.|$|R
5000|$|In the book, Bugliosi is {{severely}} critical of prosecutors Marcia Clark and Christopher Darden. Bugliosi {{argued that a}} major mistake in the trial was the District Attorney's assigning Clark and Darden to prosecute it. This was because Bugliosi considered the two to be average prosecutors, who lacked the competence and skill to try such a significant murder case as Simpson's. Bugliosi noted what <b>he</b> thought <b>were</b> <b>glaring</b> mistakes made by the prosecution; for example: he faults prosecutors for not introducing the note Simpson had written before trying to flee, which one friend took to be a suicide note. Bugliosi writes that the note [...] "reeked" [...] of guilt, and the jury should {{have been allowed to}} see it. He also noted that the jury was never told that Simpson was traveling with his friend Cowlings with a change of clothing, a large amount of cash, his passport, and a disguise kit. Bugliosi criticized Clark and Darden for not allowing the jury to hear the tape of Simpson's statement to police about cutting his finger the night of the murders, in which he prevaricates over his story.|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>he</b> <b>is</b> out there," [...] she said, in an awe-hushed whisper. [...] "Those {{eyes will}} <b>be</b> <b>glaring</b> at him to-night, and at your comrade Lieutenant D'Arnot. Can you leave them, gentlemen, {{without at least}} {{rendering}} them the passive succor which remaining here a few days longer might insure them?" ...|$|R
60|$|ALICE. 'Cosmo.' She {{is not a}} tamed mother yet, and {{in sudden}} wrath she flips his face with her hand. He accepts it as a smack. The Colonel foolishly chooses this moment to make his return. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> in high good-humour, and does not observe that two of his nearest {{relatives}} <b>are</b> <b>glaring</b> at each other.|$|R
25|$|Cao Cao {{had stayed}} in Wan for more than 10 days when Zhang Xiu {{suddenly}} rebelled and launched a surprise attack on Cao's camp. Cao Cao was caught unprepared so he retreated with a few horsemen. Dian Wei stood guard {{at the entrance to}} the camp and prevented Zhang Xiu's soldiers from advancing further. The enemy then scattered and broke into Cao Cao's camp from the other entrances. Dian Wei had about a dozen men with him and they were all heavily outnumbered by Zhang Xiu's forces. However, Dian Wei fought bravely with a long ji, and with each swing of his weapon, he broke more than ten enemy spears. As the battle went on, Dian Wei's men were eventually all killed and Dian himself had sustained several wounds all over his body, but he continued fighting the enemy at close quarters with short weapons. Dian Wei grabbed two enemies and killed them, and the others did not dare to approach him. Dian Wei then rushed forward and slew several more enemy soldiers before eventually succumbing to his wounds. Just before his death, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> still <b>glaring</b> and swearing at the enemy. Only after confirming that Dian Wei was dead did the enemies dare to come forward and decapitate him. Dian Wei's head was passed around for Zhang Xiu's men to see. They also came to look at his headless body.|$|R

5000|$|The {{video for}} [...] "Shelf in the Room", {{directed}} by Sean Mullens, bears the rural and color aesthetics {{depicted in the}} album art of Days of the New. It focuses on a troubled adolescent boy, likely a reflection of Days of the New frontman Travis Meeks. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> first seen <b>glaring</b> through the display window of an antique store before shattering it with his fists. The store owner comes out to yell at the boy who carelessly leaves. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> then shouted at by {{a man on the}} street and barked at by a dog, all of whom appear in a motion blur. Later on, the boy is surrounded by older kids who begin taunting him. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> chased out of town and into the woods where he finds solace in a small wooden building. While appearing no bigger than an outhouse from its exterior, inside is a large empty room. The boy places items he has obtained, including a set of old keys, a dead bird's feather, and shards of glass, on a shelf. He then sits curled up on a chair {{in the middle of the}} room.|$|R
