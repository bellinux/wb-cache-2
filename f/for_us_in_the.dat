25|$|The Orthodox Church {{offers the}} spiritual healing so many need as they realize the {{emptiness}} of secularism and materialism. The task <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Church is to offer true spirituality rather than the empty entertainment that passes for Christianity in the West. We must get beyond duels over the Scripture with fundamentalists and revisionists, and instead challenge people with the evidence we have for the true healing and theosis found only in the Orthodox Church.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, Richard Pascale {{wrote that}} {{relentless}} change requires that businesses continuously reinvent themselves. His famous maxim is “Nothing fails like success” {{by which he}} means that what was a strength yesterday becomes the root of weakness today, We tend to depend on what worked yesterday and refuse {{to let go of}} what worked so well <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past. Prevailing strategies become self-confirming. To avoid this trap, businesses must stimulate a spirit of inquiry and healthy debate. They must encourage a creative process of self-renewal based on constructive conflict.|$|E

In an interview with Greg Kelton of The Advertiser, Loughnan outlined the band's future: [...] "If Beyond doesn't make it <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> States {{we might as well}} forget all about Ayers Rock." [...] From May to July they toured the US again, [...] "only achiev limited success overseas." [...] After the tour Dunlop and Loughnan left, and on 25 August Mushroom Records announced that Ayers Rock had broken up after Loughnan decided to remain in the US to study. Brown, Doyle, and McGuire indicated that they would revive the group with new members.|$|E

500|$|Flanders was {{an early}} and strong critic of fellow Republican Senator Joseph McCarthy’s [...] "misdirection of our efforts at {{fighting}} communism” and his role in “the loss of respect <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world at large.” He felt that rather than looking inward for communists within U.S. borders, the nation should look outward at the “alarming world-wide advance of Communist power” that would leave the United States and Canada as “the last remnants of the free world.” On March 9, 1954 he addressed Senator McCarthy on the Senate floor, expressing these concerns. (McCarthy had been advised of the speech, but was absent at the time.) Apart from a brief note of encouragement after this speech, Flanders was grateful that President Eisenhower {{stayed out of the}} McCarthy controversy. Members of President Eisenhower’s cabinet passed along the message that Flanders should “lay off.” ...|$|E
500|$|The band's overall {{low profile}} in 2008 was {{initially}} {{thought to be}} due to them spending time working on their second album. However, in December 2008, Delorentos explained in their MySpace blog that a potential record deal had fallen through due to the prospective label encountering financial problems. Added to this, the collapse of Pinnacle, their distribution company, denied the band a chance to release their album in the United Kingdom. Their blog entry stated that [...] "these are strange times for everyone, and <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> music industry {{there has been a lot}} of uncertainty. It just happened that our opportunity coincided with this extraordinary time." [...] After performing a number of shows with fellow Dubliners Director, Delorentos announced their break-up on 17 February 2009. The split came about after Yourell decided to leave the band due to his desire to [...] "do other things". A MySpace entry stated: [...] "It's with a very heavy heart that we have to let you know that Ronan has decided to leave the band. He feels its best for him to move on and do other things. The three of us will still be making music and will let you know about what happens next". However, they still planned to record their second album, believed to be titled You Can Make Sound, in March 2009 – it would contain all the songs they had written in the previous year – and play [...] "a gig or two" [...] as part of a farewell tour. The band's farewell tour includes shows in Whelan's in Dublin and Cyprus Avenue in Cork. Reaction to the split was generally one of shock – The Kinetiks were amongst the neighbouring bands they had influenced, Jacqui Carroll attributed her discovery of Irish music to an early Delorentos show, whilst blogger UnaRocks, John Walshe of State, Jonnie Craig and others had recently been championing the band's sound. On 22 April 2009, the band announced they would not split after all, citing a newfound excitement for recording as their reason. Yourell later explained that the band signing away their independent stance only to be let down by their record company had [...] "knocked us out of our stride" [...] and had led to him considering his future.|$|E

[...] Carney would later use barbiturates and amphetamines as well as alcohol substitutes, and also tried psychotherapy and joined Alcoholics Anonymous to battle his addiction, which he said ran in the family.

2500|$|... "This Little Light" [...] {{is based}} around [...] "This Little Light of Mine", a gospel song written by American {{composer}} Harry Loes {{in the early}} 20th century. It first appeared on LZ7's EP Gasoline, which was released in the UK in August 2008. It was then remixed in 2010 for inclusion as track one on the band's second studio album, Light, and {{was used as a}} theme song for both The Message Trust's charitable initiative Shine Your Light and the UK government's Shine Week 2010. LZ7 launched the 2010 remix at a gig at the Manchester Apollo, before promoting the track at summer festivals and an eight-date schools tour around Manchester. The band encouraged people to make a note of the release date and to download the single, with Lindz West, LZ7's frontman, remarking: [...] "What we don't want is anyone phoning up stations and saying 'Why aren't you playing this song?', because that just creates a bad name <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first place. What we do want is people buying it and getting it to the position where it has to go on the radio airplay lists and the stations have to play it." ...|$|E

Kapombo said of the second game, [...] "We were not prepared to lose to Kenya; actually we knew {{that we were going to}} beat them by four goals like they did to us. They changed most of the players who we played with in Zambia and that made it very hard <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> midfield which failed to click."

2500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} on 15 November 2010. In addition, Egan fully expressed what he felt on during recording Gravity: [...] "It’s hard to believe this is our 11th album but performing is our passion and it would seem like throwing it all away if we stopped."“Both us and Take That go for epic pop songs but them taking Robbie back hasn’t made us think about Brian McFadden returning. It would feel odd to have a fifth person back on stage with us". In addition Westlife told Digital Spy: [...] "We'd {{wanted to work with}} him for a long time, but all his loyalty was to Take That and he didn't want to work with another boyband," [...] "We'd been asking him and asking, but literally within moments of Take That deciding to go and work with Stuart Price, he said yes to us straight away. Afterwards he said he'd wanted to work with us for a long time, but he just couldn't do the Take That thing and the Westlife thing because they were too close." [...] "John created a sound <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same way he created a sound for Take That, a sound for Bon Jovi and a sound for all the other incredible artists he's worked with," [...] "He created a sound for Westlife that we haven't had before - it's not a massive departure, but it's definitely a step up in terms of production." [...] Filan also revealed that the group is currently in the process of selecting 12 or 13 songs for the album's final track listing from a pool of 16, with all but [...] "one or two" [...] likely to be originals.
