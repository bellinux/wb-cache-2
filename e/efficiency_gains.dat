5|$|There is {{considerable}} {{debate about whether}} the Khazzoom-Brookes Postulate is correct, and of {{the relevance of the}} Jevons paradox to energy conservation policy. Most governments, environmentalists and NGOs pursue policies that improve efficiency, holding that it will lower resource consumption and reduce environmental problems. Others, including many environmental economists, doubt this 'efficiency strategy' towards sustainability, and worry that <b>efficiency</b> <b>gains</b> may in fact lead to higher production and consumption. They hold that for resource use to fall, <b>efficiency</b> <b>gains</b> should be coupled with other policies that limit resource use.|$|E

5|$|Considerable debate exists {{about the}} size of the rebound in energy {{efficiency}} and the relevance of the Jevons paradox to energy conservation. Some dismiss the paradox, while others worry that it may be self-defeating to pursue sustainability by increasing energy efficiency. Environmental economists have proposed that <b>efficiency</b> <b>gains</b> be coupled with conservation policies that keep the cost of use the same (or higher) to avoid the Jevons paradox. Conservation policies (such as cap and trade) do not display the paradox, and can be used to control the rebound effect.|$|E
5|$|Jevons {{warned that}} fuel <b>efficiency</b> <b>gains</b> tend to {{increase}} fuel use. But {{this does not}} imply that improved fuel efficiency is worthless: higher fuel efficiency enables greater production and a higher material quality of life. For example, a more efficient steam engine allowed the cheaper transport of goods and people that contributed to the Industrial Revolution. However, if the Khazzoom–Brookes postulate is correct, increased fuel efficiency, by itself, will not reduce the rate of depletion of fossil fuels.|$|E

5|$|Economists have {{observed}} that consumers tend to travel more when their cars are more fuel efficient, causing a 'rebound' in the demand for fuel. An increase in the efficiency with which a resource (e.g. fuel) is used, causes {{a decrease in the}} cost of using that resource when measured in terms of what it can achieve (e.g. travel). Generally speaking, a decrease in the cost (or price) of a good or service will increase the quantity demanded (the law of demand). With a lower cost for travel, consumers will travel more, increasing the demand for fuel. This increase in demand is known as the rebound effect, and {{it may or may not}} be large enough to offset the original drop in demand from the increased efficiency. The Jevons paradox occurs when the rebound effect is greater than 100%, exceeding the original <b>efficiency</b> <b>gains.</b>|$|E

40|$|This article studies a model where, as a {{consequence}} of private information, agents do not have incentive to invest in a desired joint project, or a public good, when they are unable to have prior discussion with their partners.

Agastya, Menezes and Sengupta (2007) prove that with a prior stage of communication, with a binary message space, it is possible to have some <b>efficiency</b> <b>gain</b> since "all ex-ante and interim efficient equilibria exhibit a simple structure". We show that any finite message space does not provide <b>efficiency</b> <b>gain</b> on the simple structure discussed in that article. We use laboratory experiments to test these results.

We also observed that communication reduces the unproductive contribution, and that a large message space cannot provide <b>efficiency</b> <b>gain</b> relative to the binary one...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{possible}} benefits {{that can be}} achieved if U. S. oil companies produced and offered a grade of higher-octane gasoline to the consumer market. The octane number of a fuel represents how resistant the fuel is to auto-ignition, which causes knock. By raising the octane number of gasoline, engine knock constraints are reduced, so that new spark-ignition engines can be designed with higher compression ratios and boost levels. In turn, engine and vehicle efficiencies are improved thus reducing fuel consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for the light-duty vehicle (LDV) fleet. The main objective of this thesis is to quantify the reduction in fuel consumption and GHG emissions {{that can be achieved}} for a given increase in octane number. Engine modeling simulations in GT-Power are used to determine the relative brake <b>efficiency</b> <b>gain</b> (part-load) that is possible for a unit increase in compression ratio. This is found to be 1. 9 % while literature data suggests a 2. 33 %- 2. 8 % <b>efficiency</b> <b>gain</b> may in fact be possible. Thus an average relative <b>efficiency</b> <b>gain</b> of 2. 35 % is assumed possible for a unit increase in compression ratio. Engine-in-vehicle drive-cycle simulations are then performed in Autonomie to determine an effective, on-the-road vehicle <b>efficiency</b> <b>gain.</b> For a compression ratio increase of 1. 5 : 1, this results in a 4. 7 % <b>efficiency</b> <b>gain</b> for a downsized, naturally-aspirated, spark-ignition vehicle. If the vehicle is turbocharged, a 6. 9 % <b>efficiency</b> <b>gain</b> is possible due to additional boosting and further downsizing. With the possible <b>efficiency</b> <b>gain</b> determined at an individual vehicle level, a fleet model is then used to calculate the aggregate benefit for the LDV fleet by simulating the deployment and adoption rate of vehicles redesigned for higher octane gasoline. According to results from the model, roughly 69 % of all LDVs on the road by 2040 will be of this high-octane variety that uses premium gasoline (98 RON). Meanwhile, premium gasoline is projected to account for almost 80 % of the total gasoline demand by 2040. Ultimately by redesigning vehicles to take advantage of 98 RON gasoline, fuel consumption and GHG emissions for the fleet can be reduced by about 4. 5 % over the baseline case, where no high-octane vehicles are introduced. This reduction jumps to 6. 0 % if 100 RON gasoline is considered instead. by Eric W. Chow. Thesis (S. M.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, 2013.
