6000|$|... "I can marry no one else. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> way so far. You {{had better}} tell Sophie Mellerby everything, {{and then a}} son of yours shall be the future Earl." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes; he {{came home}} about a {{fortnight}} ago. I was going to write to you. O Mr. Audley, {{if you are not}} in haste, can you tell me whether <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> dear Diego's grave?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I sure have," [...] was the retort, [...] "and a third {{interest}} in Harper and Ladue's. And <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> corner lots selling {{out for more}} than your hen-scratching ever turned up on Birch Creek." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is unpleasant, Hugh, for <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{scarcely}} <b>see</b> <b>my</b> horse's head; and {{as there}} are several tracks crossing this, we are likely enough to go wrong." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I am {{captured}} by the Yankees. So far as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see,</b> <b>my</b> only chance of escape {{is to make the}} sentries drunk. The bearer is absolutely to be trusted. Give him his canteen full of spirits, and tell him what I have written here." ...|$|E

6000|$|The actor {{left the}} table {{and began to walk}} about the room. [...] "I shall want that play. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> part in Haxard. I know just how I could make up for him. And the play is so native, so American, that it will go like wildfire." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{going to}} my studio to-morrow," [...] he said. [...] "I promise not to go out. I must be where <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> work. If I can't paint, I can draw; I can feel my brushes, move my things about. I shall go mad if I do nothing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not in any {{tangible}} {{shape to}} such as I, but this at least I know. In {{spite of the}} destruction of the mortal clay, when <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> way no further, and lose courage in my task, fresh strength comes to me after a night spent here." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh no!" [...] she said. [...] "I don't mind work, but I {{like to be}} free when work is over. I {{board in}} an honest family, and live in a little room {{at the top of}} the house which is all my own and where <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You forget," [...] he {{reminded}} her, [...] "that {{there will be}} a perfectly legitimate side to my profession.

Needless to say, I shall have to refuse the majority that are offered to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Anton likes fair hair--such as yours--and bright grey eyes such as {{you have}} got. I said they were green, and he pulled my ears. But now I look, Nina, I think they are green. And so bright! <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> own in them, though it is so dark. That {{is what they call}} looking babies." ...|$|E
60|$|April 16. The {{woman is}} ingenious in her torments. She knows how fond I am of my work, and how highly my lectures are thought of. So {{it is from}} that point that she now attacks me.
