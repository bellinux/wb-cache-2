5|$|In {{the second}} half of the nineteenth century, local artists also {{supplemented}} the figure with items such as radishes, pretzels, laurel wreaths and foaming beer steins. The symbol <b>diversely</b> appears in numerous places such as on manhole covers, beer steins and the top of the tower of the town hall. While the symbol as a man through being a monk was previously clear, its gender has become ambiguous since being designated the Kindl. One interpretation is that it is simply genderless, however in the 1920s a female inclination became apparent, and portrayals in person are to this day by young women.|$|E
5|$|The lion is {{probably}} represented more frequently and <b>diversely</b> {{than any other}} animal. In most forms, the lion has no apotropaic meaning and was merely decorative. However, it sometimes has an astrological or symbolic meaning. One of the popular forms of the lion is explicitly heraldic form, including in the Persian coat of arms (the lion and sun); the animal in the coat of arms of the Mamluk Baybars and perhaps also in that of the Rum Saldjukids {{of the name of}} Kilidi Arslan; and in numismatic representations.|$|E
5|$|The {{appearance}} of an ala is <b>diversely</b> and often vaguely described in folklore. A given ala {{may look like}} a black wind, a gigantic creature of indistinct form, a huge-mouthed, humanlike, or snakelike monster, a female dragon, or a raven. An ala may also assume various human or animal shapes, and can even possess a person's body. It is believed that the diversity of appearances described is due to the ala's being a synthesis of a Slavic demon of bad weather and a similar demon of the central Balkans pre-Slavic population. In folk tales with a humanlike ala, her personality {{is similar to that of}} the Russian Baba Yaga. Ale are said to live in the clouds, or in a lake, spring, hidden remote place, forest, inhospitable mountain, cave, or gigantic tree. While ale are usually hostile towards humans, they do have other powerful enemies that can defeat them, like dragons. In Christianized tales, St. Elijah takes the dragons' role, but in some cases the saint and the dragons fight ale together. Eagles are also regarded as defenders against ale, chasing them away from fields and thus preventing them from bringing hail clouds overhead.|$|E
25|$|SnoRNAs {{are located}} <b>diversely</b> in the genome, the {{majority}} of vertebrate snoRNA genes are encoded in the introns of genes encoding proteins involved in ribosome synthesis or translation, and are synthesized by RNA polymerase II, they are also shown to be located in intergenic regions, ORFs of protein coding genes, and UTRs. SnoRNAs can also be transcribed from their own promoters by RNA polymerase II or III.|$|E
25|$|Diversity of antigen presentation, {{mediated}} by MHC classes I and II, is attained {{in at least}} three ways: (1) an organism's MHC repertoire is polygenic (via multiple, interacting genes); (2) MHC expression is codominant (from both sets of inherited alleles); (3) MHC gene variants are highly polymorphic (<b>diversely</b> varying from organism to organism within a species). Major histocompatibility complex and sexual selection has been observed in male mice making mate choices of females with different MHCs and thus demonstrating sexual selection. Also, at least for MHC I presentation, there has been evidence of antigenic peptide splicing which can combine peptides from different proteins, vastly increasing antigen diversity.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the complex}} {{geological}} history of the Pacific Northwest, the geography of the Oregon Coast is <b>diversely</b> varied, and is often separated into different regions based on geological formations. Three primary landforms are common along the Oregon coast, and help distinguish the regions based on their frequency of occurrence and location {{in relation to the}} shoreline: sea cliffs, beaches, and stacks. However, because of this, it is difficult to divide the Oregon Coast into uniform and clear cut regions. Despite this, The Oregon Coast is traditionally divided into three distinct regions; The North Coast, Central Coast, and South Coast. Because of minor land variation between the North and Central Coast regions, the division between these two regions is a more of a civil division than that of a geological division. This is due mostly to the larger cities in the North Coast region than in the Central Coast region. However, several minor differences do exist between the two regions, both in terms of geology and socioeconomic differences.|$|E
500|$|Praise {{was also}} {{reserved}} for Beyoncé's vocal performance. The Telegraphs Neil McCormick declared Beyoncé as [...] "one {{of the most}} technically gifted vocalists in pop" [...] favoring her [...] "gospel power, hip-hop flow and [...] range". He was particularly complementary of the vocal restraint displayed across the tracks that was absent from previous releases. Kitty Empire of The Observer noted the diverseness of her vocals on the album's up-tempo songs and found the singer ranging between [...] "squeaky sexed-up falsettos, hood rat rapping, wordless ecstasies and effortless swoops". Clash regarded her voice most effective on the album's ballads, where they commented on how <b>diversely</b> her vocals conveyed feelings of love and described her [...] "power and control [...] breathtaking".|$|E
500|$|At the age {{of eight}} in 1560, Coke began {{studying}} at the Norwich Free Grammar School. The education there was based on erudition, the eventual goal being that by {{the age of}} 18 the students would have learned [...] "to vary one sentence <b>diversely,</b> to make a verse exactly, to [...] an epistle eloquently and learnedly, to declaim of a theme simple, and last of all to attain some competent knowledge of the Greek tongue". The students were taught rhetoric based on the Rhetorica ad Herennium, and Greek centred on the works of Homer and Virgil. Coke was taught at Norwich to value the [...] "forcefulness of freedom of speech", something he later applied as a judge. Some accounts relate that he was a diligent student who applied himself well.|$|E
500|$|Vince Ingenito of IGN {{recalled}} {{being left}} [...] "staring slack-jawed" [...] at the visuals, {{and called the}} open world [...] "beautifully and <b>diversely</b> realized" [...] with impressive lighting effects. Tom Mc Shea of GameSpot called the visuals [...] "incredible". Oli Welsh of Eurogamer praised Seattle's art direction, and found the draw distances and frame rate consistent. David Meikleham of PlayStation Official Magazine (OPM) was very impressed with the graphics and 1080p definition, but cited occasional frame rate dips during intense combat. He enjoyed playing in Seattle and using his powers to level the destructible environments. Tamoor Hussain of Computer and Video Games (CVG) praised graphical details like the particle and lighting systems. [...] " [...] colorful, rich in detail and {{has some of the}} best effects we've seen on console", he wrote.|$|E
500|$|Hwang {{was given}} a free hand with dialogue; he {{was not allowed to}} change lyrics. [...] Hwang was inexperienced at writing musicals, and the {{producers}} hired veteran Robert Longbottom to direct the production and collaborate on the new script, [...] "really a new musical which has a pre-existing score." [...] Only the character names, the San Francisco Chinatown setting and some of the relationships were retained, but the pair sought to be faithful to the spirit of both Lee's novel and the musical's original concept of old-world and older generation values struggling with new-world temptations and the desires of the younger generation. [...] This concept is reflected in the struggle for survival of Wang's Chinese opera company, as it competes with the more modern, Americanized night club run by Ta. [...] The role of Mei-li (as spelled in the revision) was expanded. [...] The character of Madam Liang was changed [...] "from the wise-owl aunt" [...] to a [...] "savvy career woman" [...] in show business. [...] Chinatown is portrayed as a more gritty and difficult place for new immigrants, and the pursuit of material success is given a more cynical face, especially in Act II. [...] The song [...] "The Other Generation" [...] was deleted; [...] "My Best Love", which had been cut in tryouts in 1958, was restored in its place, and [...] "The Next Time It Happens" [...] was imported from Pipe Dream. [...] New orchestrations were by Don Sebesky and music director David Chase. [...] According to The New York Times, Hwang [...] "has reshaped the story to elucidate two of his own abiding thematic interests: the idea of the theater as a prism for society and the generational clashes of <b>diversely</b> assimilated immigrants." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{master and}} [...] "usher" [...] (deputy headteacher) {{were to be}} {{appointed}} by the city out of the revenues assigned to them, who were required {{to have a good}} knowledge of classical languages, namely Latin and Greek. Additionally, the master was required to be a university graduate, of [...] "sound religion", and not to take on additional work. The salary of the usher was £6. 13s. 4d. and the master a [...] "handsome" [...] sum of £10, which by 1636 had risen to £50. The 1566 statutes declared the school was to provide Greek and Latin instruction for 90 sons of Norwich citizens free of expense and up to ten fee-paying pupils. By the 19th century the city was observed to generally leave room for as many boarders and other day scholars to sufficiently remunerate the teachers. Admission was limited to boys thought to benefit from the education offered, and the school was highly selective as a result. The education was based on erudition, the eventual goal being that by the age of 18 the pupils would have learned [...] "to vary one sentence <b>diversely,</b> to make a verse exactly, to [...] an epistle eloquently and learnedly, to declaim of a theme simple, and last of all to attain some competent knowledge of the Greek tongue". Pupils were taught rhetoric based on the Rhetorica ad Herennium, and Greek centred around the works of Homer and Virgil. In addition to classical literature, etiquette was taught as both were deemed fundamental to a good education. Edward Coke studied at the school at the age of eight from 1560 until 1567, where he {{is said to have been}} taught to value the [...] "forcefulness of freedom of speech", something he later applied as a judge.|$|E

2500|$|Dictionary {{pages are}} {{formatted}} in three columns, each {{split between the}} head entry character, number, and pronunciations on the left, and the translation equivalents ("definitions"), cross references, and subentries of terms on the right. Giles attempts to arrange the subentry example words and phrases according {{to the order of}} the translation equivalents. The dictionary's approximately [...] "hundred thousand examples" [...] <b>diversely</b> range from the [...] "best and highest planes of Chinese thought" [...] to everyday words and nursery rhymes (1892: vii).|$|E
2500|$|Cephalopods are {{remarkable}} for how quickly and <b>diversely</b> they can communicate visually. To produce these signals, cephalopods can vary {{four types of}} communication element: chromatic (skin coloration), skin texture (e.g. rough or smooth), posture and locomotion. Changes in body appearance such as these is sometimes called polyphenism. The common cuttleﬁsh can display 34 chromatic, six textural, eight postural and six locomotor elements, whereas flamboyant cuttlefish use between 42 and 75 chromatic, seven textural, 14 postural, and seven locomotor elements. For the Caribbean reef squid (Sepioteuthis sepioidea), it is thought they have a [...] "language" [...] with up to 35 distinct signalling states, i.e. [...] "words".|$|E
2500|$|Part of the {{historical}} information about this site, comes from the [...] "Relación de Michoacan" [...] (1542), the essential 16th century document that makes reference to this native community. By such reference {{it is known that}} the place was dominated by the Purépecha, from at least 300 years before Spaniards arrival. Data confirmed by archaeological excavations and objects found. Among these materials are not only the elegant typical pottery, negative decorated or pipes, but also metal objects, like bells, [...] "fistoles", clamps or axes that demonstrates the presence of <b>diversely</b> applied metallurgical techniques. Most of these manufactures have older trajectories, product of millenarian cultural traditions. Thus in the sample place were found older objects. At the same time, these allowed to visualize the relation of this place with other neighboring communities and important cities, such as Teotihuacán, many years before the Purépecha arrival.|$|E
2500|$|Conductors responded <b>diversely</b> to Gould and {{his playing}} habits. George Szell, who led Gould in 1957 with the Cleveland Orchestra, remarked to his assistant, [...] "That nut's a genius." [...] Leonard Bernstein said, [...] "There is nobody quite like him, and I just love playing with him." [...] Bernstein created a stir at the concert of April 6, 1962 when, {{just before the}} New York Philharmonic was to perform the Brahms Piano Concerto No. 1 in D minor with Gould as soloist, he {{informed}} the audience that he was assuming no responsibility for what {{they were about to}} hear. He asked the audience: [...] "In a concerto, who is the bossthe soloist or the conductor? (audience laughter). The answer is, of course, sometimes the one and sometimes the other, depending on the people involved." [...] Specifically, he was referring to their rehearsals with Gould's insistence that the entire first movement be played at half the indicated tempo. The speech was interpreted by Harold C. Schonberg, music critic for The New York Times, as an abdication of responsibility and an attack on Gould. Plans for a studio recording of the performance came to nothing. The live radio broadcast (along with Bernstein's disclaimer) was subsequently released on CD.|$|E
2500|$|Robert Herbert interprets Metzinger's statement: [...] "What Metzinger meant is {{that each}} little tile of pigment has two lives: it exists as a plane whose mere size and {{direction}} are fundamental {{to the rhythm of}} the painting and, secondly, it also has color which can vary independently of size and placement. This is only a degree beyond the preoccupations of Signac and Cross, but an important one. Writing in 1906, Louis Chassevent recognized the difference, and as Daniel Robbins pointed out in his Gleizes catalogue, used the word [...] "cube" [...] which later would be taken up by Louis Vauxcelles to baptize Cubism: [...] "M. Metzinger is a mosaicist like M. Signac but he brings more precision to the cutting of his cubes of color which appear to have been made mechanically". The interesting history of the word [...] "cube" [...] goes back at least to May 1901 when Jean Béral, reviewing Cross's work at the Indépendants in Art et Littérature, commented that he [...] "uses a large and square pointillism, giving the impression of mosaic. One even wonders why the artist has not used cubes of solid matter <b>diversely</b> colored: they would make pretty revetments." [...] (Robert Herbert, 1968) ...|$|E
2500|$|The English sinologist Charles Aylmer, {{who first}} {{published}} The Memoirs of H. A. Giles from a Cambridge University Library manuscript, gives a balanced evaluation on the dictionary. Aylmer says {{the second edition}} [...] "impresses by its sheer bulk" [...] but falls short of the [...] "highest standards of the best 19h-century lexicography". First, the dictionary does not cite sources for terms, but <b>diversely</b> includes both Classical Chinese literary archaisms from sources like the Kangxi Dictionary and modern vernacular colloquialisms that Giles [...] "laboriously collected from books read and conversations held during {{a long stretch of}} years." [...] Second, Giles failed to indicate stylistic level, which he justifies on the [...] "(somewhat specious) grounds" [...] that, [...] "No division of phraseology into classical and colloquial has been made, {{for the simple reason that}} no real line of demarcation exists. Expressions are used in ordinary conversation which occur in the Book of Odes. The book-language fades imperceptibly into the colloquial." [...] (1912: viii). A third lexicographical shortcoming is the random arrangement of subentries, [...] "requiring the reader to con up and down the columns". As a general rule, Giles explains (1892: vii), [...] "the meanings found in the Classics stand first, and more modern and colloquial meanings follow. But to this rule there are some striking exceptions, purposely introduced, so as not to impair any value this Dictionary may have as a practical book of reference." [...] Despite these deficiencies, Aylers says Giles' dictionary [...] "held the field for many decades and lives on in successors", such as Robert Mathews' (1931) A Chinese-English Dictionary Compiled for the China Inland Mission, many of whose definitions [...] "are taken, without acknowledgment, from Giles".|$|E
