50|$|In 2002 the British Army's L118 guns {{completed}} {{replacement of}} their optical sights with the LINAPS artillery pointing system (APS) mounted above the barrel. This is a self-contained system that uses three ring laser gyros to determine azimuth, elevation angle and trunnion tilt angle. It also includes facilities for navigation and self-survey using a global positioning system, inertial <b>direction</b> <b>measurement</b> and distance measurement. All {{this can be}} used {{anywhere in the world}} to lay the gun without external references. The outputs and inputs for APS are through the touchscreen layer's display and control unit (LCDU) that replaced the conventional dial sight and its mount. The LCDU enables the layer to lay the gun by moving the barrel until the LCDU displays no difference between the ordered firing data and where the barrel is pointing as determined by the LINAPS sensors.|$|E

To acquire broader and flatter spectrum, a Sensitivity Compensate Transmitting (SCT) signal was proposed. The SCT signal is calculated from inversed filtering of received signal. Here, two types SCT signal are proposed. As a Sensitivity Compensated AM (SCAM) signal, an amplitude modulated chirp wave is proposed. Furthermore, for higher Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), a non-linear FM signal is proposed as a Sensitivity Compensate FM (SCFM) signal. In this paper, {{effectiveness of the}} SCT signal on 2 -D <b>direction</b> <b>measurement</b> is discussed. By using the SCT signal, the time resolution of compressed pulse is improved, and accuracies of <b>direction</b> <b>measurement</b> using the SCT signal are improved than that of using the chirp wave.

40|$|In {{this article}} we present an idea of using liquid {{scintillator}} Cherenkov neutrino detectors to detect the mantle and K- 40 components of geoneutrinos. Liquid scintillator Cherenkov detectors feature both energy and <b>direction</b> <b>measurement</b> for charge particles. Geoneutrinos can be detected with the elastic scattering process of neutrino and electron. With the directionality, the dominant intrinsic background originated from solar neutrinos in common liquid scintillator detectors can be suppressed. The mantle geoneutrinos can be distinguished because they come mainly underneath. The K- 40 geoneutrinos can also be identified, if the detection threshold for <b>direction</b> <b>measurement</b> can be lower than, for example, 0. 8 MeV.

40|$|For a {{two-dimensional}} solid silicon thermal wind sensor with symmetrical structure, the wind speed and direction {{information can be}} derived from the output voltages in two orthogonal directions, i. e., the north-south and east-west. However, the output voltages in these two directions will vary linearly with the ambient temperature. Therefore, in this paper, a temperature model to study the temperature effect on the wind <b>direction</b> <b>measurement</b> has been developed. A theoretical analysis has been presented first, and then Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations have been performed. It is found that due to symmetrical structure of the thermal wind sensor, the temperature effects on the output signals in the north-south and east-west directions are highly similar. As a result, the wind <b>direction</b> <b>measurement</b> of the thermal wind sensor is approximately independent of the ambient temperature.

A new systematic technique that improves the location accuracy of the surface point in the axis of the buried dipole is developed and tested. It is based on the use of state-of-the-art topographic equipment for the null-field <b>direction</b> <b>measurements,</b> that are further processed by two estimation algorithms, namely, the extended information filter and the extended Kalman filter. In addition, emphasis is placed on the study of the sources of error in order to establish the accuracy of the method. This analysis is conducted in a half-space model in which electromagnetic propagation is studied by numerical integration of analytical solutions. The results are confirmed by a direct solution of the problem by the finite-element method. From the computations, simple equations are provided for practical use. Then, an experimental study shows that the uncertainty of the null-field <b>direction</b> <b>measurements</b> can be modeled by a Gaussian probability density function.
