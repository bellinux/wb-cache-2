5000|$|As the {{subtitle}} indicates, The Magnetic Lady is a humors comedy, {{a form that}} Jonson had begun exploring three decades earlier and {{the last of the}} type that Jonson would write. The play is supplied with an Induction and a set of entr'actes that Jonson calls [...] "Intermeans," [...] through which the characters Probee and the ignorant Damplay have the play explained to them as it proceeds, by the Boy who's been left in charge of the [...] "Poetique Shop." [...] The focus of the play lies in the wealthy Lady Loadstone and her young, attractive, [...] "marriageable" [...] niece Placentia Steel. Placentia is the target of the amorous ambitions of a set of gulls and fools and hangers-on [...] - [...] Parson Palate, Doctor Rut, Bias, Practice the lawyer, and Sir Diaphanous Silkworm. Lady Loadstone's brother, Sir Moth Interest, is Placentia's <b>financial</b> <b>trustee,</b> and cares about little but maintaining control of her money. This crew is counterbalanced by two Jonsonian men of worth: Compass, Lady Loadstone's faithful steward, and his friend Captain Ironside.|$|E

5000|$|Miss M. {{resolves}} {{to achieve}} financial and spiritual independence {{by becoming a}} fortune teller and horseback rider in a circus and discovers that she likes and is good at performing. She also realizes that she now reciprocates Mr. Anon's love and friendship, and she promises to come away with him and set up housekeeping nearby, implying that they will marry at some future time. Mr. Anon insists that they leave immediately and that she stop displaying herself in public. Miss M. angrily refuses. She has performed {{for two of the}} three nights she promised the circus manager—in exchange for a large sum—though she is ashamed to mention the money to Mr. Anon, presenting it as a matter of not breaking her contract. They arrange for Mr. Anon to take Miss M.'s place in the ring for the last evening. Dressed in woman's clothes, he rides out, sidesaddle—to the jeers and mockery of the crowd. There is an accident and he is thrown from the horse and seriously injured, though he remounts and finishes his ride. As he and Miss M. leave together in his pony cart, he dies, just as Miss M. realizes the depth of his love for her and the extent of her own recklessness and ingratitude. Tormented by guilt she wanders alone in the woods, fighting the impulse to kill herself. She is deterred, finally, by her conviction that only through leaving the world in a peaceful frame of mind will she be likely to meet her lover after death. In the meantime, her <b>financial</b> <b>trustee,</b> Sir Walter Pollacke, a banker, has been able to restore her fortune, enabling her repurchase her family home. The frame story of the novel, an introduction narrated by Sir Walter, recounts that Miss M. went on to live comfortably for many years in the house of her birth, seeing few people, with Mrs. Bowater as her housekeeper and himself as an occasional visitor. Mrs. Bowater has told Sir Walter that one evening she heard mysterious voices coming from Miss M.s room and when she went to check found no one, only a note from Miss M. saying that she had been [...] "called away," [...] perhaps, the reader is left to conclude, to the spirit world to join her lover in another dimension.|$|E

50|$|Gregory married Marion Scott Hume in 1864. The Register of the Queensland Parliament, 1860-1927 {{states that}} Gregory {{resigned}} as mining Commissioner for Stanthorpe in November 1872 {{to take over}} the administration on the Estate of his late friend William Beit, and the family moved to Westbrook. William Beit was the father of William Beit Jnr, the builder of Ascot House in Toowoomba. In 1874 Gregory entered the Queensland Legislative Council and the family moved back to Harlaxton. In 1874 Francis Thomas Gregory was listed in the Post Office Directory as a Justice of the Peace, Darling Downs. From information available in the Post Office Directory, 1883-84, Gregory is listed as Vice-President of Horticultural Association, Chairman of Highfields Divisional Board and Chairman and Treasurer of the Toowoomba Grammar School. Information in files of the National Trust of Queensland claim that, in 1877, Gregory was the <b>financial</b> agent for <b>trustees</b> of Beit (Westbrook) and Tooth (Clifton).

5000|$|The Trustee Savings Bank (TSB) was a British <b>financial</b> institution. <b>Trustee</b> savings banks {{originated}} {{to accept}} savings deposits from those with moderate means. Their shares were not {{traded on the}} stock market but, unlike with mutually held building societies, depositors had no voting rights; nor did they have the power to direct the financial and managerial goals of the organisation. Directors were appointed as trustees (hence the name) on a voluntary basis. The first trustee savings bank was established by Reverend Henry Duncan of Ruthwell in Dumfriesshire for his poorest parishoners in 1810 with its sole purpose being to serve the local people in the community [...] Between 1970 and 1985, the various trustee savings banks in the United Kingdom were amalgamated into a single institution named TSB Group plc, which was floated on the London Stock Exchange. In 1995, the TSB merged with Lloyds Bank to form Lloyds TSB, at that point the largest bank in the UK by market share and the second-largest (to HSBC, which had taken over the Midland Bank in 1992) by market capitalisation.|$|R

50|$|In 2003, {{considerable}} controversy arose {{when the}} Waterloo Region District School Board was selecting {{a high school}} to close, in order {{to open a new}} school in the southwest end of Kitchener (this was required under the provincial funding model of the time). A large public outcry began when the staff report recommended the closure of KCI, along with Southwood Secondary School. Although the school was plagued with many heating, plumbing and electrical problems due to its age, sentimentality and emotions won the day and some repairs and renovations were decided upon. Critics of this proposal noted that KCI had a significant history and a unique culture among secondary schools in Kitchener and Waterloo, partly due to the wide variety of socio-economic and cultural backgrounds among its students. Regardless of the enormous job and associated costs, further analysis of the <b>financial</b> situation by <b>trustees,</b> eliminated the need for a Kitchener school closure.|$|R
5|$|Smith was a benefactor {{during the}} period of reconstruction. He became {{frustrated}} that, during a time when the Hospital was so clearly in need of <b>financial</b> assistance, the <b>trustees</b> of his Irish munificence were choosing to procrastinate in their remittances of the annual grant. By the mid-1670s he had determined to use the powers granted to him {{under the terms of the}} Royal Charter in order to divert surplus funds from the Trust to the Hospital, and by 1681 relations between Smith and the trustees were so strained that both the governments in London and in Dublin were involved in attempts to determine who had responsibility both for the administration and collection of income and for the distribution thereof. One such involved person was Sir John Temple, the Solicitor-General for Ireland, who asserted that anomalies between the stipulations of 1667 and the Charter of 1669 showed that the revenue should stay in Ireland, and also that there was in fact no surplus available in any event because the Trust had not at that time met with all of its responsibilities in Ireland under the terms of the Charter.|$|R
50|$|Because of the <b>financial</b> difficulties, the <b>trustees</b> were {{cautious}} about expansion. Victor Anderson, the business manager, had proposed a 200- to 250-bed facility in 1927, but the projected construction costs {{were higher than}} expected. A study of the potential use of the new space, presented in October 1930, revealed that Minneapolis had too many hospital beds after a construction boom in the 1920s. In 1936, the demand for hospital beds had become favorable enough {{to build a new}} wing to the hospital. Magney and Tusler reworked some earlier plans to meet the latest standards in hospital architecture, while retaining a harmonious appearance on the outside by using brick similar to the Dunwoody and Janney wings and by using similar size and massing to the nearby apartment buildings. The Wyman wing was completed in September 1938 and added sixty beds to the hospital. The first floor of the addition was devoted to administrative and staff functions, and also contained the kitchen and dining rooms for the entire hospital. The second and third floors housed patient rooms, and the fourth floor had four operating rooms, an X-ray lab, and other laboratories.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{suggests}} an imbalance between the theological, eschatological {{mission of the}} Church and its current investment and use of capital resources. Some of the invested funds clearly involve unethical enterprises. Investigations into this statement are based on biblical principles and historical examples and progress through time to consider diverse influences involving the Church and its money. The aim of my thesis is {{to assess the impact}} of Church investments within a world of economics that encourages the accumulation of wealth yet often ignores the consequences for the Church and their effect upon the world. I begin my research by examining the principles for financial relationships and systems as established within the Bible. I then compare the voices, which speak of the principle of wealth redistribution as they involve the Church in specific moments of history. I conclude by focussing on the present day unease within the Church, as an institution, the ethical investment policies of four Christian denominations and their relationship to the secular view of wealth in the complex world of fiscal establishments. I have discovered links between high-yield investments, those not banned for ethical policies, and their consequence within the eco-systems of the natural world and to detriment of human flourishing. My investigations have also found that both within and outside the Church both Christian and secular voices have urged opposition to investment in industries that harm the environment. This work should have important implications for Church investors today, especially those who have a responsibility to endorse ethical <b>financial</b> policies. <b>Trustees</b> of the Churches are expected to sustain the future work of mission as well as oversee the conservation of material resources but my investigations have highlighted the requirement for greater accountability in choices of ethical investments. I have identified some of the investments that result in the destruction of the natural world and draw attention to the rise in the number of people who stand together against this practice...|$|R

40|$|Only {{nine percent}} of South Africa {{citizens}} {{who are members of}} retirement funds will be financially independent once they reach retirement age. The other 91 percent will be dependent on other means to supplement their monthly income after retirement. Little is known about the financial communication sent to retirement fund members. This article thus aims to contribute to the knowledge base of financial communication in the context of retirement funds and to the managerial practice of financial communication in a retirement fund context. A survey was conducted to determine how trustees and members of retirement funds perceive financial communication. The aim of the survey was to compare trustee and stakeholder members' perceptions of the various channels of financial communication, preferences with regard to the above financial communication channels and the importance of the message content of financial communication sent to members. The results show that both trustees and members of retirement funds regard benefit statements as the most important channel of communication. There is a statistically significant difference between how trustees and members of retirement funds view the use of printed information and group presentations to communicate financial information. Both groups indicated a preference for information on a quarterly basis as opposed to annual reports. With regard to the content of financial communication, both members and trustees indicated that the most important information is the current value and performance of their investments. With regard to preferred financial channels of communication, a statistically significant difference was found between how trustees and members view access to the pension fund's call centre. A statistically significant difference was also found between how trustees and members believe the pension fund should work. This study attempts to make a contribution to financial communication {{within the context of the}} retirement fund industry in South Africa. It is necessary for fund trustees (management) to reconsider their traditional use of communication channels to inform fund members (stakeholders). It is anticipated that this study will increase awareness of financial communication in the retirement fund industry in South Africa where illiteracy is of national concern and where current financial communication is often drenched with financial jargon and technicalities merely to ensure compliance with legislation. Clear, understandable and unambiguous information content should be reflected in <b>financial</b> communication to <b>trustees</b> and member stakeholders...|$|R
40|$|Book description: In {{times of}} {{economic}} and financial crises, the content of this book rings true. Drawing from interviews with executives, senior managers and/or auditors from renowned companies (eBay, Google, Hewlett Packard, Intel, Levi Strauss & Co., Microsoft, Novartis and many others) and theory from fields of sociology and social psychology, this research study provides {{an understanding of how}} "tone at the top" imprints on an organization and why that imprint works. More specifically, it discusses how managers' principles and practices can actively shape an open-minded culture that enhances effective internal control. Praise from academics and practitioners: “Dr. Pfister sheds new light on the critically important, but often-overlooked, "softer" forms of control, such as corporate culture. And he does it in a rigorous and engaging way. A very worthwhile read! “ Kenneth A. Merchant, Deloitte and Touche LLP Chair of Accountancy, University of Southern California “In our increasingly complex and multicultural world it is high time that someone tackles the implications of different assumptions among the team members in finance and accounting groups. ” Edgar H. Schein, Professor Emeritus, MIT Sloan School of Management “Dr. Pfister provides a well-written, accessible and comprehensive overview of the control environment and identification of the key practical drivers highly useful to managers in implementing controls and creating culture; and which auditors and boards can use to assess the quality of the control environment: the organizational culture. ” James Wall, retired CFO Core-Mark International, Board <b>Trustee,</b> <b>Financial</b> Executives Research Foundation “This book is a “must read” and provides a valuable resource for board members, senior management, operations management, systems designers, auditors, consultants, or other internal control practitioners. ” H. C. “Pete” Warner, CPA, CIA, CICP, President Internal Control Institute "It is now accepted that organizational culture has an important impact on management practices. But Dr Pfister's book makes substantial progress in detailing precisely how differences in culture impact on the design and use of management control systems. It will be of significant use to both business controllers and to academics try to advance our understanding of this important area. ” David Otley, Distinguished Professor of Accounting & Management (Emeritus), Lancaster University Management School, UK “Many professionals see the only relationship between Culture and Control in the fact that both start with a "C". They could not be more wrong. This highly recommendable book provides key insights on the close link between the two. [...] . This book also demonstrates why Finance and HR must start talking to each other instead of practicing disconnected performance management from inside their isolated silos. ” Bjarte Bogsnes, Vice President of Performance Management Development, Statoil, Chairman, Beyond Budgeting Round Table Europe Book reviews: "this study provides a much-needed next step in academic research aimed at understanding the relationships between such complex phenomena as "internal control" and "organizational culture.
