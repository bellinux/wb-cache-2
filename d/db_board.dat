Experimental tests were conducted along with developing nonlinear finite element model to explore the effect of MA in the PSSDB floor. Experimental results of the PSSDB panel with simply end support were exploited to verify the nonlinear finite element results.

The objectives of this thesis are to determine the effect of screws spacing to the stiffness of profiled steel sheeting dry board and to investigate the relationship between the spacing of the screws and the stiffness of the panel. The testing was carried out by using 0. 8 mm of Peva 45 and 9 mm thickness of Primaflex Board. The size of each specimen is 2440 mm of length and 1200 mm of width. Both of PSS and DB are connected by the screw with the spacing of 100 mm, 200 mm and 300 mm. The bending test was performed to determine the maximum load that can supported by this PSSDB floor system before its failure. From the experiment, the maximum load can be applied on the panel with spacing 100 mm is 12. 725 kN/m, for 200 mm is 9. 807 kN/m, and for 300 mm is 9. 184 kN/m.

However, shrinking fellowship and travel funds necessitated {{a shift in}} training paradigm. Thus, transformation of teaching materials used in F 2 F trainings resulted to AquaHealth Online, a team developed and electronically delivered course on Health Management in Aquaculture. The general objective of the course transformation was to train a large pool of geographically dispersed participants at minimum cost, and this paper reports on the experience earned in course development, delivery and outcome. To enable Fish Health specialists to develop materials and skills to deliver courses for the online environment, SEAFDEC/AQD collaborated with the University of the Philippines Open University to help adapt, enhance, and reformulate materials in the F 2 F course for online delivery. The specialists underwent hours of training in "techno-pedagogy", or ways of transforming teaching activities into formats that could be understood even in our absence. The primary learning resource is a CD-ROM that provides interactive information with self-assessment questions. The course covers 12 modules in 4 units: I. Introduction to Fish Health Management; II. Infectious Diseases of Fish and Crustaceans; III. Non-Infectious Diseases; and IV. Disease Diagnosis, Prevention and Control.

40|$|Objective. Decision <b>boards</b> (<b>DBs)</b> help clinicians present {{options and}} include {{patients}} in the decision-making process. Our objective was to describe the steps to develop a DB to support shared decision making and assess reliability and construct validity. Methods. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) scenarios were designed {{with the support of}} experts for disease severity, potential side effects, and outcomes. the DB comprised clinical information, 2 different treatment options (oral and intravenous), a description of the potential to control SLE within 5 years, and a list of potential side effects. Patients selected what they thought would be the 3 worst side effects and were informed of the probability that these would occur. We presented the DB to 172 patients who were asked to select and justify 1 treatment option. Reliability was assessed by kappa statistics. Construct validity was tested by an a priori hypothesis, analyzing the correlation between treatment decision and side effects selected, self-assessment score, educational level, and clinical aspects. Results. Patients favored oral medication, and side effects most often listed were iatrogenic cancer (44. 2 %), hair loss (21. 6 %), and severe infection (19. 1 %). justifications were risk (48. 9 %), practicality (36. 6 %), effectiveness (12. 2 %), and risk-benefit tradeoff (2. 3 %). Reliability was similar to that found in the test phase (kappa = 0. 689, P < 0. 001). Validity was tested by prediction of treatment decision based on the undesirable side effects selected (P = 0. 047). DB content was clear and easy for all patients to understand (P = 0. 05). Immunosuppressive drugs influenced patient decisions (P = 0. 006). Conclusion. DB is a reliable and valid instrument to assess SLE patient preference.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Studies have {{suggested}} that number of siblings and birth order is associated with obesity. However, studies combining these exposures are needed. This study aimed at investigating obesity in {{children and young adults}} in regard to different combinations of family size and birth order. METHODS: Two cohorts selected from the general population were investigated: The Copenhagen School Health Records Register (CSHRR) and a Draft <b>Board</b> (<b>DB)</b> sample with measured heights and weights in childhood (age 13 years) and young adulthood (age 19 years), respectively. Information on birth order, number of siblings, and relevant covariates were available on 29 327 children, as well as on 323 obese young men and 575 randomly selected controls of young men representing approximately 58 000. The relation between number of siblings and birth order, respectively, and having a Body Mass Index (BMI) z-score above or equal to the 95 (th) percentile in childhood or having a BMI of at least 31. 00 kg/m(2) in young adulthood was analysed using logistic regression analyses adjusted for relevant confounders. RESULTS: Only children had significantly higher odds of obesity both in childhood and in young adulthood compared with children with siblings, odds ratio (OR)  = 1. 44 (95 % Confidence Interval (CI) : 1. 26 - 1. 66) and OR= 1. 76 (95 % CI: 1. 18 - 2. 61), respectively. No association between first-born status and obesity was found. The OR of last-born children being obese was also significantly increased in childhood, e. g. OR= 1. 93 (95 % CI: 1. 09 - 3. 43) of obesity if last-born in a family of four children. This was not found in young adulthood. Additionally, higher spacing to previous sibling (average 1872 vs. 1303 days; p= 0. 026 in four children families) was observed in obese last-born compared to non-obese last-born children. CONCLUSION: Being an only or last-born child is associated with obesity. These associations may provide leads to targeted prevention of obesity in children...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} demand of construction in Malaysia, the government has embarked and taken initiative to implement the Industrial Building System (IBS) such as the Profiled Steel Sheeting Dry Board (PSSDB). PPSDB panelling system can be classified as lightweight composite structural system {{and can be used}} as a floor, roof and wall panel. This PSSDB system. consists of Steel Sheeting (SS) and Dry <b>Board</b> (<b>DB)</b> which 'is connected to each other with self-tapping and self-drilling screws. PSSDB system can be used as temporary shelter and is suitable because it will reduce the time construction. Besides that, PSSDB system can also reduce the use of the materials like concrete and timber formworks hence reduce the overall cost. The objectives of this research are to determine the stiffness of the floor panel and to identify the relationship between thicknesses of dry board and panel stiffness. In this study, three pieces of 1. 0 mm Peva 45 and three different thicknesses of Plywood; 12 mm, 18 mm and 20 mm, have been used in the PSSDB floor panel as steel sheeting and dry board respectively. Meanwhile, MK-Fasteners screws type is used to attach the SS and DB together. Through the bending experiment, the stiffness of the panel can be determined by calculating the slope for each graph of Load vs. Deflection that has been obtained. The result shows that the stiffness value is increased from 109 kNm 2 /m to 122 kNm 2 /m when the thickness of plywood is increased from 12 mm to 18 mm. Similarly, when the thickness is 20 mm, the stiffness value is increased to 129 kNm 2 /m. According to the results obtained, it showed that the thicker plywood will give the higher value of stiffness. In other words, the thicker the plywood, the higher the value of stiffness. Therefore, the thickness of the plywood plays the important role in determining the value of stiffness...|$|R
40|$|Energy-efficient power {{amplifiers}} capable of supporting advanced communication standards {{are essential for}} the expanding wireless infrastructure. The Doherty power amplifier (DPA) {{is one of the}} most common high efficiency power amplifier (PA) architectures. However, the DPA is significantly sensitive to model accuracy due to its complex design, leading to sub-optimal performance. A proposed solution to overcome this barrier of inaccuracy is to use measurement data from an experimental active load-pull setup. In this work, an active load-pull system was developed, tested and used in the characterization of a 10 W GaN HEMT. The characterization data were used in combination with a new DPA design approach, intended to provide an improved efficiency and linearity tradeoff, to design and fabricate a DPA. The developed active load-pull system was used for fast acquisition of load-pull data in a wide range of input and output power levels. The system was developed using modular components, allowing an easy adjustment to the specific needs of any future project. The characterization of the GaN device was conducted by using a precursor development <b>board</b> (<b>DB).</b> The DB contained the device along with its stability network and second harmonic and baseband terminations. The DB was characterized at different power levels of interest and was used as is in the final DPA design. The designed and fabricated DPA presented excellent performance with good agreement with the theoretical predictions, verifying the robustness of the implemented designed method. The DPA was designed to operate at 2. 14 GHz and reached an output power level of 40. 8 dBm which was 1. 5 dB less than the expected, and with a gain of 11. 4 dB at back-off (BO) and 10. 9 dB at full power (FP). The power added efficiency at - 6. 2 dB BO was 42. 3 % and 50. 1 % at FP. The phase response of the DPA presented a distortion of 8. 8 degrees at BO and 17. 6 degrees at FP. The developed active load-pull system proved to be a powerful tool for characterizing transistors for PA design. However, the final results indicate that the system needs further improvements in the accuracy of the measurements. That being said, this thesis is as an important milestone for the quest of making better PAs required for future wireless communication systems...|$|R
