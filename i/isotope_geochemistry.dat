This is well documented for North American rivers in arid and proglacial regions, but is also true of rivers in unglaciated, humid-temperate regions. Here, we present a record of Holocene hydroclimatology for a humid, temperate watershed in the Appalachian Mountains of eastern North America. We use stable <b>isotope</b> <b>geochemistries</b> of a stalagmite and clastic cave sediments to reconstruct Holocene climate and ecology in the Greenbrier River catchment (3, 600 km 2) of southeastern West Virginia. Independently, we use river-deposited cave sediments to construct a history of incision, aggradation, and morphological change in the surface channel. The clastic cave deposits display enriched (less negative) values of sedimentary d 13 Corg during the Holocene Climatic Optimum (HCO), which regional pollen records indicate was warm compared to later climes. The river channel had aggraded by. 4 m during or prior to the HCO and adopted an alluvial morphology, {{probably due to the}} mobilization of hillslope sediments accumulated during the colder, drier full-glacial conditions of the Late Pleistocene. As climate moistened during the Holocene, the Greenbrier River incised through channel-filling sediments and back onto bedrock, but not until, 3, 500 cal. years B. P. Therefore, the bedrock morphology of many streams in the Appalachian Mountains may not have existed for much of the Holocene, which highlights the effect of climate variability on channel processes.

25|$|Organic {{geochemistry}} is {{the study}} of organic molecules that appear in the fossil record in sedimentary rocks.

40|$|Cyclicities in the {{sedimentary}} record {{have long}} been documented at di↵erent time and space scales. The longstanding debate is about the various origins that have been put forward to explain them : eustastic sea level changes, sediment supply variations, subsidence pulses or tectonic variations. In the deep water system of the lower-middle Eocene Ainsa basin, in the southern Pyrenees (Spain), {{as well as in}} its fluvial counterparts in the Tremp-Graus basin, stratigraphic cyclicity in the form of repetitive packages of sand and shale alternations of intermediate timescales (104 to 106 years) has long been recognized and has typically been imputed to eustatic changes, with a modulation by active tectonics. Most of the studies have so far focused either on the deep water system or on their fluvial counterparts without a detailed e↵ort at the correlation between both. Our objective is to evaluate the role of eustatic variations, that are well known to have taken place at these periods, in generating or modifying such cyclicities. This is particularly important in order to understand how sea-level fluctuations are tided to depositional environments over multi-millennial times- cales and how the deep-sea sedimentary record can be used to reconstruct the Earth’s history of surface response to climate change. To address these issues, a mapping and multi-proxy approach was undertaken in the Tremp-Graus and Ainsa basins.

Major and trace elements show significant changes at ca. 29. 5 Ma and 26 - 23 Ma, whereas epsilon-Nd values show a single change at ca. 26 - 23 Ma. Increases in Al/Ti, Al/K, Rb/Sr, and La/Lu ratios {{and a decrease in}} the Th/La ratio of the sediments beginning at 29. 5 Ma are consistent with more intense chemical weathering in the source region. The abrupt change in Nd <b>isotopes</b> and <b>geochemistry</b> at ca. 26 - 23 Ma coincides with a major discontinuity in the sedimentology and physical properties of the sediments, implying a drastic change in sedimentary provenance and environment at the drill site. Comparison of the Nd isotopes of sediments from major rivers flowing into the South China Sea suggests that pre- 27 Ma sediments were dominantly derived from a southwestern provenance (Indochina-Sunda Shelf and possibly northwestern Borneo), whereas post- 23 Ma sediments were derived from a northern provenance (South China). This change in provenance from southwest to north was largely caused by ridge jumping during seafloor spreading of the South China Sea, associated with a southwestward expansion of the ocean basin crust and a global rise in sea level. Thus, the geochemical and Nd isotopic changes in the sediments at ODP Site 1148 are interpreted as a response to a major plate reorganization in SE Asia at ca. 25 Ma...|$|R

40|$|Oxygen <b>isotopes</b> and <b>geochemistry</b> from lake sediments are {{commonly}} used as proxies of past hydrologic and climatic conditions, but the importance of present-day hydrologic processes in controlling these proxies are sometimes not well established and understood. Here we use present-day hydrochemical data from 13 lakes in a hydrologically connected lake chain in the northern Great Plains (NGP) to investigate isotopic and solute evolution along a hydrologic gradient. The d 18 O and d 2 H {{of water from the}} chain of lakes, when plotted in d 2 H- d 18 O space, form a line with a slope of 5. 9, indicating that these waters fall on an evaporation trend. However, 10 of the 13 lakes are isotopically similar (d 18 O = 6 ± 1 ‰ VSMOW) and show no correlation with salinity (which ranges from 1 to 65 ‰). The lack of correlation implies that the isotopic composition of various source waters rather than in-lake evaporation is the main control of the d 18 O of the lakes. Groundwater, an important input in the water budget of this chain of lakes, has a lower d 18 O value (- 16. 7 ‰ in 1998) than that of mean annual precipitation (- 11 ‰) owing to selective recharge from snow melt. For the lakes in this chain with salinity < 15 ‰, the water Mg/Ca ratios are strongly correlated with salinity, whereas Sr/Ca is not. The poor correlation between Sr/Ca and salinity results from uptake of Sr by endogenic aragonite.

Examination of 45 years of water quality data shows that groundwater mining has affected water quality. Stable isotopes of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, sulfur, and chlorine and radiocarbon, tritium and radon determinations refine the interpretation of hydrogeochemical evolution of Tucson basin groundwater as modelled with NETPATH. Two distinct sampling periods, the first in 1965 and the second between 1984 and 1989, resulted in the determination of groundwater ages for water mined two decades apart. Isotope hydrology and geochemical modelling suggest {{that much of the}} water presently mined from the Tucson basin has a component recharged during the last 50 years. Increased sulfate concentrations suggest that heavy pumping in the northeastern basin may have induced increased leakage from lower units. Results of geochemical modelling indicate an average of 5 percent mountain-front recharge to the Ft. Lowell Formation along the northern aquifer margin. An increase in dissolved solids along the basin margin implies that this component to recharge has increased in the past decade. The radiocarbon age of the basin groundwater was compared with the temporal movement of water as modelled with MODFLOW and PATH 3 D. In general, the hydrologic simulation agrees with both the distribution of tritium and the exponentially modelled water age, as determined with bomb-derived radiocarbon, for areas of the Tucson basin that contain water less than 50 years in age.

Lake water level began increasing about AD 400, and reached its maximum during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA), AD similar to 900 - 1100. Low lake water level was recorded during the Little Ice Age (LIA), AD similar to 1400 - 1820, which allowed macrophyte development in the littoral zone that was recorded by high C org /N total ratios. Considerable lake level variability was evident during the Current Warm Period (CWP). Humid/dry conditions in northeast Brazil during MCA/LIA, respectively, {{are related to the}} southward shift of Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) during austral summer and fall. Those conditions contrast with records of a decrease/increase in the South American Summer Monsoon (SASM) during these periods. This observation also contrasts with paleoclimate inferences from the circum-Caribbean region indicating a northward shift of the ITCZ northern hemisphere summer position during the MCA and a southward shift during the LIA. We suggest that these shifts in ITCZ seasonality were higher during the MCA and smaller during the LIA. Our aim was to answer whether the zonal atmospheric circulation cell between the Amazon and northeast Brazil was responsible for antiphasing with the SASM. A strong monsoon over South America during the LIA reinforced convection upon Amazon, increasing the northeast low in the upper troposphere and large-scale subsidence over northeast Brazil and the Atlantic Ocean leading to a northward repositioning of the South Atlantic Subtropical Anticyclone.
