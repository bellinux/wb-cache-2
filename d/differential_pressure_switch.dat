40|$|AbstractIdeal heat {{exchangers}} recover as much heat {{as possible from}} an engine exhaust {{at the cost of}} an acceptable pressure drop. They provide primary heat for a thermoelectric generator (TEG), and their capacity and efficiency is dependent on the material, shape, and type of the heat exchanger. Six different exhaust {{heat exchangers}} were designed within the same shell, and their computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models were developed to compare heat transfer and pressure drop in typical driving cycles for a vehicle with a 1. 2 L gasoline engine. The result showed that the serial plate structure enhanced heat transfer by 7 baffles and transferred the maximum heat of 1737 W. It also produced a maximum pressure drop of 9. 7 kPa in a suburban driving cycle. The numerical results for the pipe structure and an empty cavity were verified by experiments. Under the maximum power output condition, only the inclined plate and empty cavity structure undergoes a pressure drop less than 80 kPa, and the largest pressure drop exceeds 190 kPa. In this case, a mechanism with a <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> is essential to bypass part of the exhaust...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaf 46) The Automated Regulator Test Machine (ARTM) is {{an electronic}} test machine {{developed for the}} Southern California Gas Company to monitor the performance of self-operated diaphragm-type natural gas service regulators. The ARTM was initially designed to serve in a capacity {{similar to that of}} an existing pneumatic system and was incorporated into Southern California Gas Company quality control procedures in 1989. Up until 1994, the ARTM was the primary inspection apparatus for all standard service regulators delivering 8 inches water column (w. c.) pressure. Problems were later encountered with data entry and the existing Honeywell controller. These issues were caused by increasing digits in regulator purchase order numbers and system memory failure evident in the existing controller setup. Other problems, related to system piping, inoperable solenoid valves, and noticeable pressure losses delayed the initial repairs greatly. The objective of this project is to resolve these problems by introducing an entirely new programmable controller, human-machine interface, and software program that will allow the ARTM to perform its function seamlessly and efficiently. The ARTM system consists of various solenoid control valves, <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>switches,</b> control piping, ram operators, pressure transmitters, an electronic mass flow meter, and a PC workstation. The goal is to incorporate existing components where possible, perform a complete functionality check, and finally, implement the newly installed software and hardware to perform a series of pressure regulator tests in sequential fashion. In addition to the software and hardware integration, overall system improvements are presented. These include various upgrades in system components, including the installation of new pressure transmitters, new solenoid control valves, a new volume bottle accumulator, and the results of a comprehensive leak assessment to eliminate pressure losses in the ARTM system. The SCADAPack 32 installation, TelePACE Ladder Logic programming, and system improvements presented are then put to the test by a series of validation tests. The regulator performance results of the ARTM are compared to those obtained by American Meter, a well known pressure regulator manufacturing company, and to the pneumatic regulator test machine (PRTM). Finally, a conclusion is presented based on the validation tests, overall perfomlance of the AR TM, and a net time savings assessment related to quality control test procedures...|$|R

40|$|Piezoelectric and {{transient}} <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> sensors are two {{among the}} most widely employed sensors for vortex flowmeter application. The present study evaluates the performance of these two techniques under fully developed and disturbed flow conditions. Firstly, {{the location of the}} transient <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> sensor is optimized to obtain high amplitude signals and good linearity in Strouhal number. Empirical mode decomposition method in combination with autocorrelation decay is successfully employed at high Reynolds numbers to identify the vortex shedding frequency in presence of hydrodynamic noise. The performance of the <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> sensor deteriorates significantly under disturbed flow conditions at low Reynolds number due to the presence of low frequency components. This deterioration in the signal quality limits the lower operating range of the flowmeter with <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> sensor. The output signals of the piezoelectric sensor and <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> sensor under no flow condition are compared to obtain the background noise due to piping vibrations and electrical interferences. These results will help a designer to suggest robust signal processing algorithms for vortex frequency detection. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
30|$|After three {{cycles of}} WAG, {{when there was}} no more oil production, an ASP slug was {{injected}} into the core and then displaced by alternate injection of water and CO 2. There was an increase in <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> during the ASP slug injection which shows a flow resistance related to the formation and propagation of the oil bank in the core due to ASP injection. The increase in <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> is due to the mobilization of residual oil which persisted until oil bank breakthrough. The mobilized oil creates an oil bank in front of the ASP slug. As the oil bank size increases, the <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> increases until oil bank breakthrough occurs. The second peak in the <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> is related to the second oil bank generated that is associated with surfactant desorption and wettability changes. After the second oil bank breakthrough and microemulsion production, the conditions in the core and the <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> profile are similar to that in the previous WAG process but slightly higher. This is possibly due to chemical slug effects such as adsorption and wettability changes.|$|R

Design of fiber optic based <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> sensor (FODPS) using intensity modulation technique is reported in this paper. A corrugated diaphragm based <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> sensor with a fiber optic probe to record this deformation/displacement of the diaphragm is designed, optimized and fabricated.
