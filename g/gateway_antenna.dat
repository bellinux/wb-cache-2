50|$|Along with {{dramatic}} advances in satellite technology {{over the past}} decade, ground equipment has similarly evolved, benefiting from higher levels of integration and increasing processing power, expanding both capacity and performance boundaries.The Gateway—or Gateway Earth Station (its full name)—is {{also referred to as}} a ground station, teleport or hub. The term is sometimes used to describe just the antenna dish portion, or it can refer to the complete system with all associated components. In short, the gateway receives radio wave signals from the satellite on the last leg of the return or upstream payload, carrying the request originating from the end-user's site. The satellite modem at the gateway location demodulates the incoming signal from the outdoor antenna into IP packets and sends the packets to the local network. Access server/gateways manage traffic transported to/from the Internet. Once the initial request has been processed by the gateway's servers, sent to and returned from the Internet, the requested information is sent back as a forward or downstream payload to the end-user via the satellite, which directs the signal to the subscriber terminal. Each Gateway provides the connection to the Internet backbone for the gateway beam(s) it serves.The system of gateways comprising the satellite ground system provides all network services for satellite and corresponding terrestrial connectivity. Each gateway provides a multiservice access network for subscriber terminal connections to the Internet.In the continental United States, because it is north of the equator, all gateway and subscriber dish antenna must have an unobstructed view of the southern sky. Because of the satellite's geostationary orbit, the <b>gateway</b> <b>antenna</b> can stay pointed at a fixed position.|$|E
30|$|For the {{high-speed}} rail LOS scenarios, {{it is assumed}} that the signal power of the second path is at least 10 dB weaker than that of the dominant LOS path; with regarding to the LOS path, the time delay of the second path varies from 65 ns to 1.3 μs (according to the WINNER II D 2 a model); the angle of arrival for the first path is determined according to the position of the wireless <b>gateway</b> <b>antenna</b> on the train and the position of track-side base station, whereas the angle of arrival for the second path varies from 0 to 2 π.|$|E

30|$|The traffic-related service drivers {{refer to}} the maximum {{throughput}} and the yearly data volume consumed by a service. These are calculated according to Equations 1 and 2. The yearly consumed data volume is used to dimension the train-to-wayside communication over cellular and over Wi-Fi. The maximum on-board throughput per car is the minimum capacity of the wireless access points (WAPs) the wiring and switches on-board the train {{have to be able}} to transmit. The maximum train-to-wayside throughput per train is the minimum capacity the on-board <b>gateway</b> servers, <b>antennas,</b> splitters and radios should be able to transmit.|$|R
30|$|Once the {{investment}} and operating cost assessment has been concluded, the service cost can be obtained. As indicated in Figure 2, {{a selection of}} the service drivers {{is used in the}} cost allocation calculator that is described in this section. For future reference, these service drivers are identified as ‘used capacity’ service drivers. The peak number of active connections is used for the WAPs. The maximum on-board throughput per car is used for the wiring and the switches. The maximum train-to-wayside throughput per train is used for the <b>gateway</b> servers, <b>antennas,</b> splitters and radios. The yearly consumed data volume is used for the train-to-wayside communication. The used capacity service driver for the other resources is a dummy variable that indicates if the service uses the resource or not.|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes novel {{relaying}} schemes {{based on}} recently proposed Modified Alamouti Code and Time Switch Space Time Coding for a homogeneous sensor network architecture. New relaying schemes {{based on the}} incorporation of aforementioned techniques in a Sensor Network framework are considered. An exhaustive analysis {{in terms of the}} total energy consumption and delay characteristics as performance metric is investigated and quantified both for stand alone and clustered sensor networking scenario. Variable Rate M-QAM modulation schemes are considered for varying gateway distances. It is observed that for the standalone case, the proposed schemes can provide significant savings in terms of energy consumption as compared to non cooperative mode and conventional Alamouti scheme. For clustered case, conventional Alamouti based scheme outperforms the proposed relaying scheme up to a certain critical threshold distance beyond which the M-Alamouti based relaying schemes becomes slightly more efficient by 16 % when we have a single <b>antenna</b> <b>gateway</b> and cluster distance is 100 m and gateway distance is 500 meter. Similar trend is observed when the distance between the clusters is increased from 100 to 200 meters. For a system with gateway having single and dual antennas the energy efficiency with respect to a non cooperative single <b>antenna</b> <b>gateway</b> system falls typically within a window of 70 to 90 % for long haul distances around 320 m onwards...|$|R
40|$|The {{comprehensive}} {{integration and}} environmental (including RF) test facilities of the Canadian Space Agency's David Florida Laboratory (CSA) (DFL) were used extensively for the MSAT Program. Following {{a description of}} the facilities, the paper outlines their application to the qualification of the two MSAT satellites following an overview of the test plan. Particular emphasis is given to passive intermodulation measurement (PIM) demands, which for the MSAT satellites, contributed to the need to extend the anechoic chamber. The extended chamber was also used for an EMC test and SAR signature test of the RADARSAT satellite. The DFL's facilities are being used for additional aspects of mobile satellite communications. One shielded anechoic Extra High Frequency (EHF) chamber and associated test equipment are employed predominantly for measuring the performance of the IRIDIUM satellites' Engineering Model <b>Gateway</b> Moveable <b>Antennas</b> (EM) (GMA). Other chambers are used for testing aeronautical antennas on behalf of Inmarsat. Still others combine thermal and PIM testing. The paper concludes with a review of the test requirements of evolving satcom missions such as Inmarsat Aero- 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} paper {{presents the}} fundamental {{aspects of the}} SATURN initiative proposed {{by a group of}} Italian companies active in developing of new solutions which exploit the potential of S-band communications. SATURN is the acronym for “Smart mAritime saTellite terminal for mUltimedia seRvices and conteNts”. Using S-band technology will make it possible to provide new services and contents on board small (10 to 24 meters) maritime vessels where satellite services are not usually enabled. The innovation of the paper is the presentation of a new cost effective solution composed of <b>antenna,</b> <b>gateway</b> and plotter in order to address the maritime market segment not covered by other bi-directional communication satellite solutions.
