5|$|The site of S.iniae {{infection}} and its clinical presentation vary from species to species. In tilapia, S.iniae causes meningoencephalitis, with symptoms including lethargy, dorsal rigidity, and erratic swimming behavior; death follows {{in a matter}} of days. In rainbow trout, it is typically associated with septicemia and central nervous system damage. Symptoms are consistent with septicemia, and include lethargy and loss of orientation (as in tilapia), exophthalmia, corneal opacity, and <b>external</b> <b>and</b> <b>internal</b> bleeding.|$|E

5|$|Black {{wildebeest}} act as hosts to {{a number}} of <b>external</b> <b>and</b> <b>internal</b> parasites. A study of the animal in Karroid Mountainveld (Eastern Cape Province, South Africa) revealed the presence of all the larval stages of the nasal bot flies Oestrus variolosus and Gedoelstia hässleri. The first instar larvae of G hässleri were found in large numbers on the dura mater of wildebeest calves, specially between June and August, and these later migrated to the nasal passages. Repeated outbreaks of mange (scab) have led to large-scale extinctions. The first study of the protozoa in blue and black wildebeest showed the presence of 23 protozoan species in the rumen, with Diplodinium bubalidis and Ostracodinium damaliscus common in all the animals.|$|E
5|$|Emus {{can suffer}} from both <b>external</b> <b>and</b> <b>internal</b> parasites, but under farmed {{conditions}} are more parasite-free than ostriches or rheas. External parasites include the louse Dahlemhornia asymmetrica {{and various other}} lice, ticks, mites and flies. Chicks sometimes suffer from intestinal tract infections caused by coccidian protozoa, and the nematode Trichostrongylus tenuis infects the emu {{as well as a}} wide range of other birds, causing haemorrhagic diarrhoea. Other nematodes are found in the trachea and bronchi; Syngamus trachea causing haemorrhagic tracheitis and Cyathostoma variegatum causing serious respiratory problems in juveniles.|$|E
5|$|A {{characteristic}} of Douglas's work is {{his attention to}} both <b>external</b> <b>and</b> <b>internal</b> detailing. Such detailing was not derived from any particular style and Douglas chose elements from whichever style suited his purpose for each specific project. His detailing applied particularly to his joinery, perhaps inspired by his experience in his father's workshop, and was applied both to wooden fittings and to the furniture he designed. A further Continental influence was his use of a Dutch gable. The most important and consistently used element in Douglas's vernacular buildings was his use of half-timbering, which was usually used for parts of the building. However, {{in the cases of}} Rowden Abbey and StMichael and All Angels Church, Altcar, the entire buildings were timber-framed.|$|E

These were projects that were both scientifically important and would require significant telescope time, {{which would be}} explicitly dedicated to each project. This guaranteed that these particular projects would be completed early, in case the telescope failed sooner than expected. The panels identified three such projects: 1) {{a study of the}} nearby intergalactic medium using quasar absorption lines to determine the properties of the intergalactic medium and the gaseous content of galaxies and groups of galaxies; 2) a medium deep survey using the Wide Field Camera to take data whenever one of the other instruments was being used and 3) a project to determine the Hubble constant within ten percent by reducing the errors, both <b>external</b> <b>and</b> <b>internal,</b> in the calibration of the distance scale.|$|E
5|$|Mikoyan {{supported}} Stalin, whom he {{had first}} met in 1919, in the power struggle that followed Lenin's death in 1924; {{he had become a}} member of the Bolshevik Central Committee in 1923. As People's Commissar for <b>External</b> <b>and</b> <b>Internal</b> Trade from 1926, he imported ideas from the West, such as the manufacture of canned goods. In 1935 he was elected to the Politburo, and was among one of the first Soviet leaders to pay goodwill trips to the United States in order to boost economic cooperation. Mikoyan spent three months in the United States, where he not only learned more about its food industry but also met and spoke with Henry Ford and inspected Macy's in New York. When he returned, Mikoyan introduced a number of popular American consumer products to the Soviet Union, including American hamburgers, ice cream, corn flakes, popcorn, tomato juice, grapefruit, and corn on the cob.|$|E
5|$|Reborning {{involves}} numerous {{time consuming}} steps. The most basic {{form of the}} process involves taking a vinyl doll, adding multiple hand painted layers of paint, and adding other physical features to the doll. Artists can pick different brands to best suit the doll they wish to create. Reborn artists can also buy reborn doll kits that are sculpted by reborn sculpt artists. A kit includes the vinyl doll parts. Customers can then purchase a reborn doll by choosing a kit (name) by sculptor (name) and have it reborned by a reborn artist (name) e.g. Adam by Mary reborned by Ann. Consumers can purchase {{a wide range of}} supplies for creating their own reborn. Making a doll from a kit allows artists to omit some steps in the fabrication process and begin with a blank canvas. Many supplies are needed for both <b>external</b> <b>and</b> <b>internal</b> modifications of reborns to make the doll seem more realistic.|$|E

5|$|The Conservative Party had {{previously}} experienced serious division during the 1850s, when the Emperor's complete {{support for the}} Conciliation policy {{gave rise to the}} Progressives. The difference then was that ultraconservatives who opposed Conciliation (led by Eusébio, Uruguai and Itaboraí) perceived the Emperor as being indispensable to the functioning of the political system: an ultimate and impartial arbiter when deadlock threatened. This new generation of ultraconservatives, unlike their predecessors, had no experience of the Regency and early years of PedroII's reign, when <b>external</b> <b>and</b> <b>internal</b> dangers threatened the nation's existence. They had only known a stable administration and prosperity. The young politicians saw no reason to uphold and defend the Imperial office as a unifying force beneficial to the nation. Unbeknownst to Rio Branco and PedroII, both had prepared the path to the Empire's later downfall.|$|E
5|$|The city {{is built}} on the slope {{surrounding}} the citadel, located on a dominating plateau. Although the city's walls {{were built in the}} third century and the city itself was first mentioned in the 12th century, the majority of the existing buildings date from 17th and 18th centuries. Typical houses consist of a tall stone block structure which can be up to five stories high. There are <b>external</b> <b>and</b> <b>internal</b> staircases that surround the house. It is thought that such design stems from fortified country houses typical in southern Albania. The lower storey of the building contains a cistern and the stable. The upper storey is composed of a guest room and a family room containing a fireplace. Further upper stories are to accommodate extended families and are connected by internal stairs. Since Gjirokastër's membership to UNESCO, a number of houses have been restored, though others continue to degrade.|$|E
5|$|The {{clitoris}} is {{a complex}} structure, containing <b>external</b> <b>and</b> <b>internal</b> components.

The clitoral body is {{commonly referred to as}} the shaft (or internal shaft), while the length of the clitoris between the glans and the body may also be referred to as the shaft (or external shaft) because, like the shaft as a whole, it supports the glans, and its shape can be seen and felt through the clitoral hood.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} approach, the given circles are shrunk or swelled (appropriately to their tangency) until one given circle is shrunk {{to a point}} P. In that case, Apollonius' problem degenerates to the CCP , which {{is the problem of}} finding a {{solution}} circle tangent to the two remaining given circles that passes through the point P. Inversion in a circle centered on P transforms the two given circles into new circles, and the solution circle into a line. Therefore, the transformed solution is a line that is tangent to the two transformed given circles. There are four such solution lines, which may be constructed from the <b>external</b> <b>and</b> <b>internal</b> homothetic centers of the two circles. Re-inversion in P and undoing the resizing transforms such a solution line into the desired solution circle of the original Apollonius problem. All eight general solutions can be obtained by shrinking and swelling the circles according to the differing internal and external tangencies of each solution; however, different given circles may be shrunk to a point for different solutions.|$|E
5|$|The common {{starling}} {{has about}} a dozen subspecies breeding in open habitats across its native range in temperate Europe and western Asia, {{and it has been}} introduced to Australia, New Zealand, Canada, United States, Mexico, Peru, Argentina, the Falkland Islands, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, South Africa and Fiji. This bird is resident in southern and western Europe and southwestern Asia, while northeastern populations migrate south and west in winter within the breeding range and also further south to Iberia and North Africa. The common starling builds an untidy nest in a natural or artificial cavity in which four or five glossy, pale blue eggs are laid. These take two weeks to hatch and the young remain in the nest for another three weeks. There are normally one or two breeding attempts each year. This species is omnivorous, taking a wide range of invertebrates, as well as seeds and fruit. It is hunted by various mammals and birds of prey, and is host to a range of <b>external</b> <b>and</b> <b>internal</b> parasites.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinction}} between <b>external</b> <b>and</b> <b>internal</b> environments, however, is an abstraction parsing life and environment into units or facts that are inseparable in reality. There is an interpenetration {{of cause and}} effect between the environment and life. The laws of thermodynamics, for example, apply to ecology by means of its physical state. With an understanding of metabolic and thermodynamic principles, a complete accounting of energy and material flow can be traced through an ecosystem. In this way, the environmental and ecological relations are studied through reference to conceptually manageable and isolated material parts. After the effective environmental components are understood through reference to their causes; however, they conceptually link back together as an integrated whole, or holocoenotic system as it was once called. This is known as the dialectical approach to ecology. The dialectical approach examines the parts, but integrates the organism and the environment into a dynamic whole (or umwelt). Change in one ecological or environmental factor can concurrently affect the dynamic state of an entire ecosystem.|$|E
