2500|$|Before knitting, the knitter will {{typically}} {{transform a}} hank/skein {{into a ball}} where the yarn emerges {{from the center of}} the ball; this making the knitting easier by preventing the yarn from becoming easily tangled. This transformation may be done by hand, or with a device known as a ballwinder. [...] When knitting, some knitters enclose their balls in jars to keep them clean and untangled with other yarns; the <b>free</b> <b>yarn</b> passes through a small hole in the jar-lid.|$|E
30|$|Among 150  g/m 2 fabrics of {{different}} materials (i.e. sample A, B and C) air permeability is highest for 100 % polyester filament fabric because of smooth and hairiness <b>free</b> <b>yarns</b> (Table  3). Hairy yarns in 100 % cotton and cotton blends offers more {{resistance to air flow}} and therefore lead to lower air permeability. Among plain, twill and satin fabrics of 200  g/m 2 weight (i.e. sample D, E and F), satin woven fabric offers highest air permeability, whereas twill fabric shows the least. This {{is due to}} the longer floats and larger pore sizes (Table  2) in satin structure. Twill fabric with compact structure offer the lowest air permeability. Further, air permeability decreases as the fabric weight increases due to compact structure with smaller pores and higher thickness.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} recent {{development}} of a yarn modification process to produce torque balanced singles spun yarns. Taking advantages of the core-sheath structure of unconventional spun yarns, we have developed a yarn modification process and applied it to singles yarns spun by rotor spinning. Torque <b>free</b> singles <b>yarns</b> have been produced from 100 % cotton fibers. The spirality of resultant single jersey knit fabrics has been greatly reduced or, in some cases, completely eliminated. Properties and performance characteristics of both parent and modified yarns {{as well as their}} resultant fabrics have been evaluated including the yarn tensile properties, surface properties, handle, air permeability, burst strength, and piling resistance of the fabrics.

30|$|From Fig.  10 b, it {{was found}} that when whip roller’s depth {{decreased}} at constant height, air permeability of grey and finished fabrics increased. During taking whip roller in less deeper position, shed area was becoming long. In long shed area, the warp yarns in the fabric structure became loose. So, <b>free</b> space between <b>yarns</b> in the fabric was increased. Thus a large amount of air could pass through the fabric during air permeability test. This phenomenon was found in both state of denim fabric.|$|R
40|$|Air {{permeability}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important parameters in the study of thermo-physiological comfort of fabrics. The main goal of this work is to develop a virtual process that allows the prediction of air permeability of any fabric without realizing a sample. The Free and Porous Media Flow physics interface was used in COMSOL Multiphysics® software; this allows to use Navier-Stokes equation in the air <b>free</b> volume through <b>yarns</b> and the Brinkman equation inside yarns. This work confirms that air permeability can be predicted with good accuracy, from the basic design parameters of any fabri...|$|R
30|$|The {{predicted}} thermo-physiological {{properties of}} plated fabrics by ANN were {{in close agreement with}} target outputs (experimental values) which proves the robustness and generalization {{ability of the}} network. However, the mean absolute percentage error in the prediction of air permeability and moisture vapour transmission rate of plated fabrics were on slightly higher side. The input parameters selected for the network construction namely back layer yarn linear density, filament fineness, loop length and total yarn linear density influence the fabrics bulk properties like thickness, fabric weight which are the determinants of thermal properties. The selected input parameters were found to be sufficient for prediction of thermal properties. However, air permeability depends on the openness of the fabric structure or the <b>free</b> inter <b>yarn</b> spaces in the fabric and hence fabric porosity. The exclusion of porosity as one of the input parameters might be the reason for high mean absolute percentage error in prediction of air permeability. Moisture vapour transmission rate through fabrics depend on free air spaces in the fabric for moisture diffusion and moisture diffusivity of the fibres. Hydrophilic and hydrophobic nature of the fibre can affect the moisture diffusion through textiles significantly. The inclusion of constituent fibres as one of the input parameter to neural network may result in lowering the error percentage in prediction of moisture vapour transmission rate.|$|R
