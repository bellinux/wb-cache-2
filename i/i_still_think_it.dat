500|$|The BBC science-fiction series Doctor Who {{has often}} been heavily {{influenced}} by the various Quatermass serials, and despite Kneale's dislike of it ("It sounded a terrible idea and <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was," [...] he commented in 1986) and his refusal to write for it, unofficial references to Quatermass {{have appeared in the}} programme and its spinoffs. [...] Serials directly influenced include The Web of Fear, The Invasion, Spearhead from Space, The Ambassadors of Death, Inferno, The Seeds of Doom and Image of the Fendahl, as well as the 2007 [...] "The Lazarus Experiment", which echoes the first serial's climax in Westminster Abbey, with the use of Southwark Cathedral. Former Doctor Who script editor and producer Derrick Sherwin admitted on a DVD documentary that the idea of setting more serials on contemporary Earth in the early 1970s was to recall a Quatermass feel.|$|E
500|$|Kneale {{never saw}} himself as a science-fiction writer, and was often {{critical}} of the genre. He particularly disliked the BBC series Doctor Who (1963–89; 1996; 2005–present), {{for which he had}} once turned down an offer to write. [...] "It sounded a terrible idea and <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was," [...] he commented in 1986. [...] "The fact that it's lasted a long time and has a steady audience doesn't mean much. So has Crossroads and that's a stinker". He also slammed Blake's 7, which he described as the lowest point of British television science-fiction: [...] "I think the low point for me would be the very few bits I've seen of a thing called Blake's 7 which I found paralytically awful. The dialogue/characterisation seemed to consist of a kind of childish squabbling" [...] and Doomwatch: [...] "I was approached to write Doomwatch. That didn't seem to be much good either." [...] Doctor Who was heavily influenced by Kneale's Quatermass serials, in some cases even using specific storylines that were very similar to those from Quatermass.|$|E
500|$|Referring to {{the scene}} in the third season where Ben {{seemingly}} fits Sawyer with a lethal pacemaker, Emerson comments [...] "Sadistic may be the word, but he doesn't seem to take much relish in it. He's just sort of detached, he looks at it coldly. I sometimes feel like everything to him is a sort of scientific experiment and he is interested in a dispassionate way in how the experiment runs its course. I think some day if we ever find out what his parentage is, that his parents were people of science". Elizabeth Mitchell, who plays Juliet, did not think it was a [...] "huge surprise for Juliet that Ben had feelings for , but <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was... it was horrifying under the circumstances". She also thought [...] " [...] this kind of wonderful mind, and I think that Ben probably has a tremendous respect for that. It's not because Juliet is so enticing, it's just the fact that she's got this amazing mind, she has this amazing, you know, intelligence, and I think that's what intrigues him, that's what draws him into her". During season four the producers deliberately left it ambiguous as to whether Ben {{was a part of the}} Oceanic 6 (six survivors of the plane crash that make it off the Island) after he appeared in one of Sayid's flashforwards.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the same}} program, Justin Tubb said [...] "I {{gave it to}} Jean (Shepard). And <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> a Girl's song. Because, when a Husband and Wife break up, it's usually the guy that has to leave, and the wife stays home and keeps {{the house and the}} furniture".|$|R
5000|$|During production, Rock Hudson openly {{complained about}} [...] "sex comedies" [...] such as A Very Special Favor: [...] "I {{think the public}} is weary. The cycle has been pushed {{about as far as}} it can go, and I think light comedy is on the wane. The {{boundaries}} have been extended almost to the limit, with producers trying to see how dirty it can get. A Very Special Favor was filthy. I thought it was filthy when I read the script, and <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> filthy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{the state}} of the case," [...] said Caddy. [...] "If I ever blame myself, <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> Ma's fault. We are to be married {{whenever}} we can, and then I shall go to Pa at the office and write to Ma. It won't much agitate Ma; I am only pen and ink to HER. One great comfort is," [...] said Caddy with a sob, [...] "that I shall never hear of Africa after I am married. Young Mr. Turveydrop hates it for my sake, and if old Mr. Turveydrop knows there is such a place, it's as much as he does." ...|$|R
2500|$|Most actors {{had contact}} before filming with the {{individuals}} {{they were to}} portray, often by telephone. Several veterans came to the production site. Hanks acknowledged that alterations were needed to create the series: [...] "We've made history fit onto our screens. We had to condense down {{a vast number of}} characters, fold other people's experiences into 10 or 15 people, have people saying and doing things others said or did. We had people take off their helmets to identify them, when they would never have done so in combat. But <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is three or four times more accurate than most films like this." [...] As a final accuracy check, the veterans saw previews of the series and approved the episodes before they were aired.|$|E
6000|$|... "You have a {{long life}} before you, Amelius. My foolish fancy about you and my lost girl still lingers in my mind; <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> may be just {{possible}} that you may meet with her, {{in the course of}} years.|$|E
6000|$|But <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> {{would be}} better were we to heap less ridicule upon the institution. Matrimony cannot be [...] "holy" [...] and ridiculous at the same time. We have been {{familiar}} with it {{long enough to make}} up our minds in which light to regard it.|$|E
5000|$|On October 5, 2010, Entertainment Weeklys website {{reported}} that Ron Moore and Naren Shankar were developing {{a remake of}} The Wild Wild West for television, but the project apparently stalled. In December 2013, Moore told Wired, [...] "Wild Wild West and Star Trek were two of my great loves. I watched both in syndication in the ’70s. Wild Wild West was really interesting, that combination of genres—a Western and secret agent, and they dabbled in the occult and paranormal. I {{really wanted to do}} a new version for CBS. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>it’s</b> a great property. Someday I hope to go back to it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Yum! Brands Chairman David C. Novak is {{credited}} with introducing the Crystal Pepsi concept. In a December 2007 interview, he stated: It was a tremendous learning experience. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> the best idea I ever had, and the worst executed. A lot of times as a leader you think, [...] "They don't get it; they don't see my vision." [...] People were saying we should stop and address some issues along the way, and they were right. It {{would have been nice}} if I'd made sure the product tasted good. Once you have a great idea and you blow it, you don't get a chance to resurrect it.|$|R
6000|$|... “It is a {{very old}} question. Can a man be pardoned and retain the offence? <b>Still,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was {{answered}} decisively,” she said.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I remember! I {{thought you}} had all got into intimacies that were for nobody's good, and <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was foolish. I know it has done for me! Well,' hastily {{catching}} up this last admission, {{as if it had}} dropped out at unawares, 'you think I made myself disagreeable?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought that}} you were all demented. I did indeed. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> a pity that he should take an American. I think that Miss Spalding is very nice, but there are English girls quite as nice-looking as her." [...] After {{that there was not}} another word said by Lady Rowley against Caroline Spalding.|$|E
6000|$|... [1]In a {{subsequent}} stage of boyhood, when these exercises {{had ceased to}} be compulsory, like most youthful writers I wrote tragedies; under the inspiration {{not so much of}} Shakspeare as of Joanna Baillie, whose Constantine Paleologus in particular appeared to me one of the most glorious of human compositions. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> one of the best dramas of the last two centuries.|$|E
6000|$|... 37. I {{can hear}} the bells ringing or tolling, away down the river, the air is so <b>still.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> must be the bells of Bonn.|$|R
6000|$|... "In a way, I am curious," [...] he admitted. [...] "I {{would like}} to see the girl again. <b>Still,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> really as a type she {{interests}} me." ...|$|R
500|$|The Gallagher {{brothers}} hold differing {{opinions about}} the album. As early as July 1997, Noel was [...] "talking down" [...] Be Here Now in the music press, describing the production as [...] "bland", and remarking {{that some of the}} tracks were [...] "fucking shit". Noel is also very keen to downplay the record's commercial success, saying: [...] "Just because you sell lots of records, it doesn't mean to say you're any good. Look at Phil Collins." [...] In Live Forever: The Rise and Fall of Brit Pop, he dismissed the album, and blamed its faults on drugs and the band's indifference during recording. He suggested that the people unsatisfied with the record simply sell it. In contrast, Noel noted that his brother [...] "thinks it fucking rocks." [...] In the same documentary, Liam defended the record, and said that [...] "at that time we thought it was fucking great, and <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> great. It just wasn't Morning Glory." [...] In 2006, Liam said of Noel, [...] "If he didn't like the record that much, he shouldn't have put the fucking record out in the first place... I don't know what's up with him but it's a top record, man, and I'm proud of it—it's just a little bit long." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Only,' she said, {{turning to}} Gerald, 'I must say that, however man is {{lord of the}} beast and the fowl, I still don't think he has any right to violate the {{feelings}} of the inferior creation. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> would have been much more sensible and nice of you if you'd trotted back up the road while the train went by, and been considerate.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Owen,' she said, 'will {{you forgive}} me for what I am going to say? I don't think I can--indeed I don't think I can--take any further steps towards disentangling the mystery. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> a useless task, {{and it does not}} seem any duty of mine to be revenged upon Mr. Manston in any way.' She added more gravely, 'It is beneath my dignity as a woman to labour for this; I have felt it so all day.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Being in London {{later in}} the year, I {{received}} through Mortimer an invitation to visit the poor lady, en famille, at Chiselhurst; but as the iron rules of imperial etiquette, even in exile, required that the hospitable request {{be made in the}} form of a [...] "command," [...] my republican independence took alarm and I had the incivility to disobey; and <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> a sufficient distinction to be probably the only American journalist who was ever employed by an Empress in so congenial a pursuit as the pursuit of another journalist.|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope so, Joe," [...] Bill said cheerily. [...] "They {{would be}} in plenty of time {{if it were not}} for the force of the tide. <b>Still,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is all right." ...|$|R
500|$|Lee {{conceptualized}} {{the video}} around {{the lyrics to}} the song: [...] "It's kind of about exposing that it's fake. And the video's more {{along the lines of}} exposing the real behind-the-scenes [...] of some of these people. It's basically showing the glamorous lifestyle and the depressed, selfish misery behind it. [...] It's like beating a dead horse at this point, but at the time Britney Spears was just coming out. But <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> relevant." [...] Joe D'Angelo of MTV News wrote that [...] "fans will get to see Amy Lee like never before. Instead of her homemade wings and signature gothic garb, the clip finds Lee dressed alternately as a wholesome teenager, a kitschy pop idol and a softly lit glamazon." [...] Amy Lee portrays the life of a model who promotes products by a company called [...] "Lies". The music video focuses on the struggles that Lee's character suffers with because of her modeling career and her opposite lifestyle.|$|R
500|$|Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{the authors}} of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, praised the episode, calling it [...] "a great episode because the {{accidents}} that befall the pro players are so funny." [...] Chris Turner, {{the author of the book}} Planet Simpson, said that the episode was the indication that [...] "the Golden Age [...] had arrived." [...] Nate Meyers gave the episode four and a half out of five, stating [...] "the script makes great use of the baseball superstars, giving each of them a strong personality and plenty of pep (the highlight has to be Mattingly's clash with Mr. Burns)." [...] Colin Jacobson disliked the episode: [...] "when [...] originally aired, I didn't like it. While I've warmed up to the show slightly over the last decade, <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> generally weak, and I'd definitely pick it as Season Three's worst." ...|$|R
60|$|The actual {{making of}} my serial into book form began soon after New Years, for I find records of my {{contract}} with Harper and Bros., {{and the arrival}} of bundles of proof. By the end of February the book was substantially made and ready for distribution, and a handsome book it was--to me. Whatever it had started out to be, it had ended as a fictional study of the red man in his attempt to walk the white man's road, and as a concept of his tragic outlook <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> worth while.|$|E
60|$|I {{must not}} fail to own the great {{pleasure}} that I have had {{in some of the}} stories of Auerbach. It is true that I have never cared greatly for 'On the Heights,' which in its dealing with royalties seems too far aloof from the ordinary human life, and which on the moral side finally fades out into a German mistiness. But I speak of it with the imperfect knowledge of one who was never able to read it quite through, and I have really no right to speak of it. The book of his that pleased me most was 'Edelweiss,' which, though the story was somewhat too catastrophical, seemed to me admirably good and true. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> very delicately done, and with a deep insight; but there is something in all Auerbach's work which in the retrospect affects me as if it dealt with pigmies.|$|E
60|$|But if the {{classics}} were taught {{as they might}} be taught--if boys and girls were instructed in Greek and Latin, not merely as languages, but as illustrations of philological science; if a vivid picture {{of life on the}} shores of the Mediterranean two thousand years ago were imprinted on the minds of scholars; if ancient history were taught, not as a weary series of feuds and fights, but traced to its causes in such men placed under such conditions; if, lastly, the study of the classical books were followed in such a manner as to impress boys with their beauties, and with the grand simplicity of their statement of the everlasting problems of human life, instead of with their verbal and grammatical peculiarities; <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> as little proper that they should form the basis of a liberal education for our contemporaries, as I should think it fitting to make that sort of palaeontology with which I am familiar the back-bone of modern education.|$|E

5000|$|Notes {{actually}} do mean something. They have power. I think of notes as being expensive. You don't just throw them around. I find {{the ones that}} do the best job and that's what I use. I suppose I'm a minimalist instinctively. I don't like to be inefficient if I can get away with it. Like on the end of [...] "With or Without You". My instinct was to go with something very simple. Everyone else said, [...] "Nah, you can't do that." [...] I won the argument and <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> sort of brave, because the end of [...] "With or Without You" [...] could have been so much bigger, so much more of a climax, but there's this power to <b>it</b> which I <b>think</b> is even more potent because it's held back... ultimately I'm interested in music. I'm a musician. I'm not a gunslinger. That's the difference between what I do and what a lot of guitar heroes do. —The Edge (1991) ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Miranda Pryor {{spent an}} {{afternoon}} {{here a few}} days ago, helping me cut out certain Red Cross garments known by the charming name of 'vermin shirts.' Susan thinks that name is not quite decent, so I suggested she call them 'cootie sarks,' which is old Highland Sandy's version of it. But {{she shook her head}} and I heard her telling mother later that, in her opinion, 'cooties' and 'sarks' were not proper subjects for young girls to talk about. She was especially horrified when Jem wrote in his last letter to mother, 'Tell Susan I had a fine cootie hunt this morning and caught fifty-three!' Susan positively turned pea-green. 'Mrs. Dr. dear,' she said, 'when I was young, if decent people were so unfortunate as to get--those insects--they kept it a secret if possible. I do not want to be narrow-minded, Mrs. Dr. dear, but <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is better not to mention such things.' ...|$|E
60|$|A {{book which}} contributed largely to my education, {{in the best}} sense of the term, was my father's History of India. It was {{published}} in the beginning of 1818. During the year previous, while it was passing through the press, I used to read the proof sheets to him; or rather, I read the manuscript to him while he corrected the proofs. The number of new ideas which I received from this remarkable book, and the impulse and stimulus as well as guidance given to my thoughts by its criticism and disquisitions on society and civilization in the Hindoo part, on institutions and the acts of governments in the English part, made my early familiarity with it eminently useful to my subsequent progress. And though I can perceive deficiencies in it now as compared with a perfect standard, <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>it,</b> if not the most, one of the most instructive histories ever written, and one of the books from which most benefit may be derived by a mind in the course of making up its opinions.|$|E
60|$|September 17th.--We walked {{yesterday}} to Florence, and visited {{the church of}} St. Lorenzo, where we saw, for the second time, the famous Medici statues of Michael Angelo. I found myself not in a very appreciative state, and, being a stone myself, the statue of Lorenzo was at first little {{more to me than}} another stone; but it was beginning to assume life, and would have impressed me as it did before if I had gazed long enough. There was a better light upon the face, under the helmet, than at my former visit, although still the features were enough overshadowed to produce that mystery on which, according to Mr. Powers, the effect of the statue depends. I observe that the costume of the figure, instead of being mediaeval, as I believe I have stated, is Roman; but, be it what it may, the grand and simple character of the figure imbues the robes with its individual propriety. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> the greatest miracle ever wrought in marble.|$|E

60|$|DEAR SIR:--Reaching home {{three days}} ago, I found your letter of February 26th.
