5|$|Once out of politics, Rutherford {{returned}} to his law practice. His partnership with Jamieson saw partners come and go. Rutherford divided his time between the original Strathcona office and the Edmonton office he opened in 1910; his practice focussed on contracts, real estate, wills and estates, and <b>incorporations.</b> In 1923, Rutherford's son Cecil joined the firm along with Stanley Harwood McCuaig, who in 1919 would marry Rutherford's daughter Hazel. In 1925, Jamieson left the partnership to establish his own firm. In 1939, McCuaig did the same. Cecil's partnership with his father continued until the latter's death.|$|E

One expansion incorporated undeveloped land in the southeast for an industrial park and a Louisiana-Pacific Canada veneer factory. The city extended sewer and water lines to the location; however, the area was not developed and with the factory only half-built, L-P Canada abandoned its plans. A business making manufactured homes bought the factory and completed its development in 2005. Another expansion incorporated the existing oriented strand board factory in {{the northwest corner of}} the city, while further <b>incorporations</b> have included undeveloped land to the south and north.|$|E

The province of New Brunswick ensures the delivery of other services including solid waste collection and recreation services unless the rural community chooses to take on these responsibilities. Rural communities that include a former village or town are an exception, as they are responsible to provide all services that were previously provided by their former municipality.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To monitor liver {{regeneration}} following partial hepatectomy, liver cell proliferation {{can be measured}} by assaying in vivo [H- 3]thymidine <b>incorporation</b> into liver cell DNA. We hypothesized that [H- 3]thymidine <b>incorporation</b> into whole liver tissue parallels [H- 3]thymidine <b>incorporation</b> into liver cell DNA, both in high proliferating and low proliferating liver. STUDY DESIGN: Liver cell proliferation in rats after partial hepatectomy or a sham operation was studied by measuring <b>incorporation</b> of [H- 3]thymidine into various fractions of liver tissue on days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 10 after surgery. RESULTS: [H- 3]thymidine <b>incorporation</b> into whole with DNA-specific [H- 3]thymidine <b>incorporation</b> into regenerating (r >. 80, P. 69, P <. 005), [H- 3]thymidine <b>incorporation</b> into DNA was CONCLUSION: [H- 3]thymidine <b>incorporation</b> into whole liver tissue is a simple technique {{that can be used}} for the study of liver cell proliferation after partial hepatectomy in rats...|$|R

25|$|Wild-type AAV has {{attracted}} considerable interest from gene therapy researchers {{due to a}} number of features. Chief amongst these is the virus's apparent lack of pathogenicity. It can also infect non-dividing cells and has the ability to stably integrate into the host cell genome at a specific site (designated AAVS1) in the human chromosome 19. This feature makes it somewhat more predictable than retroviruses, which present the threat of a random insertion and of mutagenesis, which is sometimes followed by development of a cancer. The AAV genome integrates most frequently into the site mentioned, while random <b>incorporations</b> into the genome take place with a negligible frequency. Development of AAVs as gene therapy vectors, however, has eliminated this integrative capacity by removal of the rep and cap from the DNA of the vector. The desired gene together with a promoter to drive transcription of the gene is inserted between the inverted terminal repeats (ITR) that aid in concatemer formation in the nucleus after the single-stranded vector DNA is converted by host cell DNA polymerase complexes into double-stranded DNA. AAV-based gene therapy vectors form episomal concatemers in the host cell nucleus. In non-dividing cells, these concatemers remain intact {{for the life of the}} host cell. In dividing cells, AAV DNA is lost through cell division, since the episomal DNA is not replicated along with the host cell DNA. Random integration of AAV DNA into the host genome is detectable but occurs at very low frequency. AAVs also present very low immunogenicity, seemingly restricted to generation of neutralizing antibodies, while they induce no clearly defined cytotoxic response. This feature, along with the ability to infect quiescent cells present their dominance over adenoviruses as vectors for human gene therapy.|$|E

40|$|Most {{analyses}} of immigrant <b>incorporation</b> are conducted on cases of industrialized democracies, polities with elaborate schemes, structures, {{and procedures for}} incorporating immigrants. Extant models of immigrant <b>incorporation</b> have been largely developed based on these polities, building on their established structures that guide and facilitate the integration of immigrants within the host polity. This narrow contextual scope leaves the scholar attempting to examine <b>incorporation</b> in atypical contexts, such as authoritarian/developing polities, at a disadvantage. In addition to this over-aggregation of case studies, most of these studies of immigrant <b>incorporation</b> explain how immigrants are incorporated, but stop short of explaining why <b>incorporation</b> progresses to the specific extent that it does.

To incorporate an area as a town, 100 electors within the area were required to prepare and submit an application to the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board (NSUARB). Upon receiving the application, the NSUARB would undertake a hearing to solicit input from interested parties and determine if there were reasonable grounds to incorporate as a town. The NSUARB would issue an incorporation order if the application was deemed reasonable.

500|$|North Arlington was {{incorporated}} as a borough by a referendum held on March 26, 1896, {{the day the}} state legislature passed a bill providing that, [...] "no borough or village shall hereafter be incorporated in this state except by special act of the legislature." [...] The following year, the legislature undertook a thorough revision of the laws relating to boroughs, and forbade <b>incorporations,</b> dissolutions, or boundary changes without its leave. This simply moved the venue for conflicts over schools from local referenda to the corridors of the State House in Trenton. Boroughs continued to be incorporated by legislative act, with a major burst in the 1920s. [...] These 20th century increases {{in the number of}} boroughs were sometimes caused by conflicts over road funds, causing Caldwell Township, Essex County, to divide into six municipalities by 1908, and with Clementon Township, Camden County fracturing into nine between 1915 and 1929.|$|E

There is no defense for the injured, but they must meekly accept the situation. It is inconsistent with liberty, a term so dear to us all". Superintendent Terhune wrote that [...] "until the boroughing is done", {{it would not be}} possible to assess the many problems that the rapid subdivision had caused: [...] "I would not attempt to estimate, let alone approximate, the changes caused by the boroughs.

40|$|Noun <b>incorporation</b> in Frisian (Dyk 1997) {{is unusual}} {{because it shows}} certain {{restrictions}} that are not seen in other languages with noun <b>incorporation,</b> such as Mohawk and Chukchi. In addition, while others argue that noun <b>incorporation</b> is indeed possible in Germanic (see Booij 2009 for Dutch, Barrie and Spreng 2009 for German), Frisian is unusual even with respect to Germanic in allowing noun <b>incorporation</b> in finite clauses. In this paper, I show that noun <b>incorporation</b> in Frisian should be analyzed as synthetic compounding, with the compound licensed by a null verbal head. It {{is the presence of}} this head that accounts for the unusual restrictions.
