40|$|This {{study was}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the penetration behaviour of different brines with tumbled beef steaks from the biceps femoris muscle, specifically their interactions with pH and effects on yield. Six muscles from different animals, divided into origin (OP) and insertion (IP) portions, were cut into 60 steaks of 2. 5 cm thickness and tumbled for 30 or 60 min. The steaks were tumbled with two brines, with (WTB/HSP) or without (WTB) <b>hydrolysed</b> <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> (HSP), and steaks that were not tumbled with brine or water were used as controls. Brine penetration was verified by measuring the amount of dye-containing brine (absorbance at 627 nm) recovered from homogenates of four thin (2 mm) slices {{from the surface of}} the beef steaks after tumbling. The WTB/HSP steaks exhibited greater (P < 0. 05) brine penetration when tumbled for 60 min than for 30 min. The OP steaks showed greater yield and lower pH (P < 0. 05) than IP steaks. HSP-added brine increased the water absorption and retention in the first slices of the steaks, and its efficiency was increased with a longer tumbling time. The portion of the biceps femoris muscle used influenced brine absorption and retention, impacting meat yield. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We evaluated plasma cytokine profiles in infants with cows’ milk allergy (CMA), who were being treated with an elimination diet. In a prospective, randomized and controlled study, infants (aged 8. 4 ± 3. 9 months) with CMA were treated with an elimination diet for 120 days, which replaced cows’ milk with a <b>hydrolysed</b> <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> formula (n = 26) or a free amino acid formula (n = 20). Blood samples were collected before treatment during active disease (T 0) and after 120 days, when symptoms were absent (T 1). Plasma cytokine concentrations were measured. Infants with CMA had higher plasma concentrations of interleukin (IL) - 4 and IL- 13 and lower concentrations of IL- 9, IL- 17 A and interferon-γ, compared with healthy breast-fed infants. At T 0, there was a positive correlation between blood eosinophil numbers and plasma concentrations of IL- 4, IL- 9, IL- 17 A and IL- 22. Treatment with a cows’ milk elimination diet resulted in a decrease in plasma IL- 4, IL- 9, IL- 13 and IL- 22 and an increase in plasma IL- 17 A. We conclude that IL- 4 and IL- 13 are elevated in active CMA. The association of IL- 9 and IL- 22 with eosinophilia, and the decrease in these two cytokines with cows’ milk elimination, suggests that they both play a role in the symptoms observed in CMA and may be important targets for future intervention...|$|E

50|$|A study {{conducted}} at Johns Hopkins University reported that Revival <b>Soy</b> <b>protein</b> shakes might support normal cholesterol health. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 216 postmenopausal women (~ 50% {{of whom were}} African-American) drank either Revival <b>Soy</b> <b>protein</b> shakes or milk protein shakes every day for 12 weeks. After 6 weeks, {{results from this study}} showed that consumption of Revival <b>Soy</b> <b>protein</b> shakes supported greater decreases in LDL-cholesterol concentration and LDL particle number than the milk protein shakes.|$|R
50|$|A {{whipping}} aid such as modified <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> {{can help}} {{to account for the}} decreased foaming ability of dehydrated or frozen egg whites. Modified <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> is a <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> in a solution which is then acidified using hydrochloric acid. Pepsin or another enzyme is then added to enhance the protein foaming abilities. Once the enzyme activity has ceased, the solution is heated to deactivate the enzyme and more hydrochloric acid is added if a pH adjustment is required.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} of this thesis was to study the effect of heat treatment and glycation on five industrially important functional properties of <b>soy</b> <b>protein,</b> namely solubility, emulsifying ability, water holding ability, acid gelation ability in soy yogurts and the heat stability of <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> emulsions. These objectives were achieved completing three tasks: 1) The physicochemical properties were studied of Soycomil K, a commercially available, insoluble <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> concentrate. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis showed that it was 28...|$|R

The sensorial properties were not affected by textured <b>soy</b> <b>protein.</b> The addition of textured <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> in preparing chicken loaf increased the water absorption and holding capacity, and decreased the moisture and ether extract content, but did not increase the final product yield...|$|R

40|$|High-moisture {{extrusion}} of <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> isolate {{generates a}} highly palatable meat substitute. No systematic {{evaluation of the}} nutritional quality of soy processed in this manner has been performed. This study compared {{the growth rate of}} male and female mice fed diets containing <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> isolate without extrusion or with high-moisture extrusion. Other measures of overall growth and animal health were examined. Minor differences in the parameters were observed. Overall, the extruded <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> was equally nutritious as the unextruded <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> for the animals. Hence, high-moisture extrusion may be considered a useful method to generate high-quality protein foods. A longer term feeding trial may be recommended to further define the nutritional adequacy of this protein...|$|R
40|$|<b>Soy</b> <b>protein</b> {{products}} such as flour, concentrates and isolates are used in food formulation because of their functionality, nutritional value and low cost. To obtain their optimal nutritive and functional properties as well as desirable flavor different treatments are used. Soybean proteins can be modified by physical, chemical and enzymatic treatments. Different thermal treatments are most commonly used, while the most appropriate way of modifying <b>soy</b> <b>proteins</b> {{from the standpoint of}} safety is their limited proteolysis. These treatments cause physical and chemical changes that affect their functional properties. This review discusses three principal methods used for modification of <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> products, their effects on dominant <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> properties and some biologically active compounds...|$|R
40|$|Significance of {{eco-friendly}} materials {{based on}} easily renewable natural resources, and the finite nature of petrochemical resources, has necessitated {{the development of}} polymers from agricultural processing by products such as <b>soy</b> <b>proteins</b> from oil processing. Although, considerable work {{was done in the}} early part of last century on polymers based on <b>soy</b> <b>protein,</b> there was almost no activity in this field for the last fifty years. There is a need to critically analyse the available literature on <b>soy</b> <b>protein</b> based polymeric materials. Therefore, an attempt is made to review the state-of-the-art of the polymeric materials with emphasis on adhesives and plastics derived from <b>soy</b> <b>protein,</b> a renewable resource abundantly available in nature...|$|R
