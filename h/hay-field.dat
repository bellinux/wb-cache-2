2500|$|The Oxford University Polo Club {{was founded}} in 1874 by Walter Hume Long (1854–1929), later Viscount Long of Wraxall and First Lord of the Admiralty. Together with his group of friends going up from Wiltshire to Oxford, he founded this new club with matches on a cut <b>hay-field</b> in Port Meadow near Wolvercote (Oxford). This field, which was 280 yards long by 170 yards wide was to become the {{foundation}} for the club’s own pologrounds for decades to come. The ground was later on prepared with old turf and could be played on in all weather conditions as it hardly ever cut up (from 1930 on as well boarded). During the winter months, matches took place on the Bullingdon Club cricket ground (Cowley) as the summer pitch in Port Meadow was near the river and subject to flooding. The club played all year round, mostly on hirelings; playing days were Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and the number of playing members seems to have averaged about a dozen. First records show that the club was playing in Hurlingham in 1876 as well as organising an exhibition match between Christ Church and Brasenose College at Christ Church Meadow on 1 July 1877. During the first decade, teams consisted of five members until [...] the set up changed in 1883 replaced by the modern game of polo.|$|E
60|$|And {{all this}} {{has come out of}} looking at the <b>hay-field</b> and the wild moor.|$|E
60|$|It was red clover, and its {{powerful}} fragrance swept upon {{her with a}} vision of the <b>hay-field</b> at home.|$|E
50|$|Alases {{are often}} used for {{pasturage}} for horses as well as <b>hay-fields.</b>|$|R
60|$|The sea {{shone like}} silver; the stars seemed to float {{there as well}} as in the sky, and the wind blew off the shore {{bringing}} the sweet smell of <b>hay-fields</b> and gardens. All the sea people sang as they lay rocking on the quiet waves, and Nelly felt as if this were the strangest, loveliest dream she had ever dreamed.|$|R
60|$|The <b>hay-fields</b> {{were like}} an {{entertainment}} on purpose for Alfred all day; {{he watched the}} shaking of the brown grass all over the meadows in the morning, and the farmer walking over it, and smelling it, and spying up to guess what would come of the great rolling towers of grey clouds edged with pearly white, soft but dazzling, which varied the intense blue of the sky.|$|R
60|$|Well, that is {{something}} like common sense. Now you will not say any more, as the cows or the butterflies might, that the <b>hay-field</b> was always there.|$|E
60|$|Ah, yes; the old story, my child: Was not {{the earth}} always {{just what it}} is now? Let us see for {{ourselves}} whether this was always a <b>hay-field.</b>|$|E
6000|$|The {{man in the}} <b>hay-field</b> {{seemed to}} think it more dignified to include Lander in this inquiry, and {{he said with a}} glimmer of the eye for him, [...] "Hea'd of do-nothin' folks?" ...|$|E
60|$|All was silent. The valley {{had begun}} to shade {{on the far side}} and the rose and gold seemed fading from the nearer. Below, on the level floor of the valley, lay the {{rambling}} old ranch-house, with the cabins nestling around, and the corrals leading out to the soft <b>hay-fields,</b> misty and gray in the twilight. A single light gleamed. It was like a beacon.|$|R
60|$|Then {{the lovely}} season flew {{on with her}} {{sunshine}} and song, and Ripple went swiftly over hill and dale till {{she came to the}} place where Summer lived. Here the sun shone warmly on early fruit and ripening grain; the wind blew freshly over sweet <b>hay-fields</b> and rustled the thick branches of the trees. Heavy dews and soft showers refreshed the growing things, and long bright days brought beauty to the world.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, justices' justice! we {{know all}} about that. Put {{an old man in}} prison for a week because he looks into his <b>'ay-field</b> on a Sunday; or send a young one to the {{treadmill}} for two months because he knocks over a 'are! All them cases ought to be tried in the towns, and there should be beaks paid as there is in London. I don't see the good of a country gentleman. Buying and selling;--that's what the world has to go by." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I believe it's so, Albe't!" [...] cried Mrs. Lander, as if {{her husband}} had disputed the theory with his taciturn back. He made no other sign of controversy, {{and the man in}} the <b>hay-field</b> went on.|$|E
60|$|The laborers {{had been}} driven through the gate-way into their <b>hay-field,</b> and Fred had checked his horse, when Hiram Ford, observing himself at a safe {{challenging}} distance, turned back and shouted a defiance {{which he did not}} know to be Homeric.|$|E
6000|$|Nettle-seed {{needs no}} digging. The ruin of this {{countryside}} by railroads was discussed, {{not only at}} the [...] "Weights and Scales," [...] but in the <b>hay-field,</b> where the muster of working hands gave opportunities for talk such as were rarely had through the rural year.|$|E
60|$|That was a {{most enjoyable}} drive, the weather too hot and sunny, perhaps, for Albinia's preferences, but {{thoroughly}} penetrating, and giving energy to, her East-Indian husband, and making the whole country radiant with sunny beauty--the waving <b>hay-fields</b> falling before the mower's scythe, the ranks of hay-makers tossing the fragrant grass, the growing corn softly waving in the summer breeze, the river blue with reflected sky, the hedges glowing with stately fox-gloves, or with blushing wreaths of eglantine. And how cool, fresh, and fair was the beech-avenue at Fairmead.|$|R
60|$|At the end {{of fifteen}} minutes, the {{carriage}} swung in through a stone gateway and on between a double row of arched and interlacing walnut trees. On either side stretched lawns, their broad sweep broken here and there by great sturdy-limbed oaks. In the near distance, {{in contrast with the}} young-green of the tended grass, sunburnt <b>hay-fields</b> showed tan and gold; while beyond were the tawny hills and upland pastures. From the head of the lawn, on the first soft swell from the valley-level, looked down the deep-porched, many-windowed house.|$|R
6000|$|My father {{believed}} in service. At {{seven years of}} age, I had regular duties. I brought firewood {{to the kitchen and}} broke nubbins for the calves and shelled corn for the chickens. I have a dim memory of helping him (and grandfather) split oak-blocks into rafting pins in the kitchen. This seems incredible to me now, and yet it must have been so. In summer Harriet and I drove the cows to pasture, and carried [...] "switchel" [...] to the men in the <b>hay-fields</b> by means of a jug hung {{in the middle of a}} long stick.|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't suppose you'd let me {{have much}} of a chance," [...] said her husband. When he came within easy hail of the man in the <b>hay-field,</b> he pulled up beside the meadow-wall, where the horse began to nibble the {{blackberry}} vines that overran it.|$|E
60|$|Softly--not all; {{you have}} {{forgotten}} the bog plants; and there are (as I said) many more plants beside on the moor than you fancy. But we will look into that another time. At all events, the plants outside are on the whole {{quite different from the}} <b>hay-field.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] said Dora; [...] "I {{will say}} {{only one more}} thing, {{and that is that}} if I were the lord of the manor, who had been working in the <b>hay-field</b> all day, I would not sit up very long, waiting for a {{wandering}} doctor." ...|$|E
6000|$|No one was at Green Street. Winifred {{had gone}} with Imogen to see a play which some said was allegorical, and others [...] "very exciting, don't you know?" [...] It was because of what others said that Winifred and Imogen had gone. Fleur went on to Paddington. Through the {{carriage}} the air from the brick-kilns of West Drayton and the late <b>hay-fields</b> fanned her still-flushed cheeks. Flowers had seemed to be had for the picking; now they were all thorned and prickled. But the golden flower within the crown of spikes seemed to her tenacious spirit all the fairer and more desirable.|$|R
60|$|As if {{she knew}} exactly what was wanted of her, Lita went back {{the way she had}} come, as Ben could see by the fresh, {{irregular}} tracks that cut up the road where she had galloped for help. For a mile or more they went, then she paused at a pair of bars, which were let down to allow the carts to pass into the wide <b>hay-fields</b> beyond. On she went again, cantering across the new-mown turf toward a brook, across which she had evidently taken a leap before; for, on the further side, at a place where cattle went to drink, the mud showed signs of a fall.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wanted to}} go to the hotel, but the doctor said it would be too noisy for me, so Mamma was glad to find rooms here. I didn't think a farm-house could be so pleasant. That view is {{perfectly}} splendid!" [...] and Emily sat up to gaze delightedly out of the window, below which spread the wide intervale, through which the river ran with <b>hay-fields</b> on either side, while along the green slopes of the hills lay farm-houses with garden plots, and big barns waiting for the harvest; and beyond, the rocky, wooded pastures dotted with cattle and musical with cow-bells, brooks, and birds.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't say {{anything}} against them!' cried the boy vehemently; 'but--but--I'd give anything--anything in the world--to {{be able to}} run about again in the <b>hay-field!</b> No, don't talk to me, Ellen, I say--I hate them all when I see them there, and I forced to lie here! I wish the sun would never shine!' ...|$|E
60|$|Well, {{and this}} <b>hay-field</b> is a manufactory: only {{like most of}} Madam How's workshops, {{infinitely}} more beautiful, as well as infinitely more crafty, than any manufactory of man's building. It is beautiful to behold, and healthy to work in; a joy and blessing alike to the eye, and the mind, and the body: {{and yet it is}} a manufactory.|$|E
60|$|The farmer appealed {{with another}} humorous cast {{of his eye}} to Lander; {{but the old man}} tacitly refused to take any further part in the talk, which began to {{flourish}} apace, in question and answer, between his wife and the man in the <b>hay-field.</b> It seemed that the children had all inherited the father's smartness. The oldest boy could beat the nation at figures, and one of the young ones could draw anything you had a mind to. They were all clear up in their classes at school, and yet you might say they almost ran wild, between times. The oldest girl was a pretty-behaved little thing, but the man in the <b>hay-field</b> guessed there was not very much to her, compared with some of the boys. Any rate, she had not the name of being so smart at school. Good little thing, too, and kind of mothered the young ones.|$|E
60|$|At {{the same}} time that his {{electric}} roads were building out through the hills, the <b>hay-fields</b> were being surveyed and broken up into city squares, with here and there, according to best modern methods, winding boulevards and strips of park. Broad streets, well graded, were made, with sewers and water-pipes ready laid, and macadamized from his own quarries. Cement sidewalks were also laid, so that all the purchaser had to do was to select his lot and architect and start building. The quick service of Daylight's new electric roads into Oakland made this big district immediately accessible, and long before the ferry system was in operation hundreds of residences were going up.|$|R
60|$|Unconsciously {{the girl}} grew to feel {{not only the}} beauty but {{the value of these}} quiet hours, to find a new peace, refreshment, and happiness, {{bubbling}} up in her heart as naturally as the brook gushed out among the mossy rocks, and went singing away through <b>hay-fields</b> and gardens, and by dusty roads, till it met the river and rolled on to the sea. Something dimly stirred in her, and the healing spirit that haunts such spots did its sweet ministering till the innocent soul began to see that life was not perfect without labor as well as love, duty as well as happiness, and that true contentment came from within, not from without.|$|R
60|$|Albinia and Ulick {{drove off}} {{at six o'clock}} on a lovely summer Sunday morning, with Maurice between them in a royal state of felicity. That long fresh drive, past summer <b>hay-fields</b> {{sleeping}} in their silver bath of dew, and villages tardily awakening to the well-earned Sunday rest, was not the least pleasant part of the day; {{and yet it was}} completely happy, not even clouded by one outbreak of Master Maurice. Luckily for him, Mary had a small class, who absorbed her superabundant love of rule; and little Alby was a fair-haired, apple-cheeked maiden of five, who awoke both admiration and chivalry, and managed to coquet with him and Ulick both at once, so that Willie had no disrespect to his sisters to resent.|$|R
6000|$|... "Glad to see {{you back}} again, Julie," [...] he said, {{ignoring}} her mother's outstretched hand and beaming smile of welcome. [...] "Going to be a hot day, I think. You must {{get out in the}} <b>hay-field.</b> Order what breakfast you please, Da Souza," [...] he continued {{on his way to the}} door; [...] "you must be hungry-after such an early start!" ...|$|E
60|$|Puck {{looked down}} the meadow that lay all quiet and cool {{in the shadow of}} Pook's Hill. A {{corncrake}} jarred in a <b>hay-field</b> near by, and the small trouts of the brook began to jump. A big white moth flew unsteadily from the alders and flapped round the children's heads, and the least little haze of water-mist rose from the brook.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I can't {{wait till}} I {{get back to}} the hotel. I want to know now. I want you should stop at the very fust house we come to. Dea'! The'e don't seem to be any houses, any moa." [...] She peered out {{around the side of the}} {{carry-all}} and scrutinized the landscape. [...] "Hold on! No, yes it is, too! Whoa! Whoa! The'e's a man in that <b>hay-field,</b> now!" ...|$|E
6000|$|When young Morland showed, by {{following}} her about with his eyes, {{what was happening}} to him, Noel was pleased. From being pleased, she became a little excited; from being excited she became dreamy. Then, about a week before her father's arrival, she secretly began to follow the young man about with her eyes; became capricious too, and a little cruel. If there had been another young man to favour--but there was not; and she favoured Uncle Bob's red setter. Cyril Morland grew desperate. During those three days the demon her father dreaded certainly possessed her. And then, one evening, while they walked back together from the <b>hay-fields,</b> she gave him a sidelong glance; and he gasped out: [...] "Oh! Noel, what have I done?" [...] She caught his hand, and gave it a quick squeeze. What a change! What blissful alteration ever since! ...|$|R
6000|$|In July the Clemenses {{left the}} small {{apartment}} at 30 Wellington [...] Court {{and established a}} summer household a little way out of London, [...] at Dollis Hill. To-day the place {{has been given to}} the public under [...] the name of Gladstone Park, so called for the reason that in an [...] earlier time Gladstone had frequently visited there. It was a [...] beautiful spot, a place of green grass and spreading oaks. In a [...] letter in which Mrs. Clemens wrote to her sister she said: [...] "It is [...] simply divinely beautiful and peaceful; the great, old trees are [...] beyond everything. I believe nowhere in the world do you find such [...] trees as in England." [...] Clemens wrote to Twichell: [...] "From the house [...] you can see little but spacious stretches of <b>hay-fields</b> and green [...] turf..... Yet the massed, brick blocks of London are reachable in [...] three minutes on a horse. By rail we can be in the heart of London, [...] in Baker Street, in seventeen minutes--by a smart train in five." ...|$|R
6000|$|Through every shape thou well canst run, Proteus, 'twixt {{rise and}} set of sun, Well pleased with logger-camps in Maine [...] As where Milan's pale Duomo lies A {{stranded}} glacier on the plain, [...] 70 [...] Its peaks and pinnacles of ice [...] Melted in many a quaint device, And sees, above the city's din, Afar its silent Alpine kin: I track thee over carpets deep To wealth's and beauty's inmost keep; Across the sand of bar-room floors Mid the stale reek of boosing boors; Where browse the <b>hay-field's</b> fragrant heats, Or the flail-heart of Autumn beats; [...] 80 I dog thee through the market's throngs To where the sea with myriad tongues Laps the green {{edges of the}} pier, And the tall ships that eastward steer, Curtsy their farewells to the town, O'er the curved distance lessening down: I follow allwhere for thy sake, Touch thy robe's hem, but ne'er o'ertake, Find where, scarce yet unmoving, lies, Warm from thy limbs, thy last disguise; [...] 90 But thou another shape hast donned, And lurest still just, just beyond! ...|$|R
