500|$|After the {{departure}} of Duchovny, the show garnered much criticism by fans and critics alike, with many saying that the bond between Mulder and Scully was what actually kept the show {{together for the first}} seven seasons of the show. Realizing his importance in the series, Chris Carter and his crew opened negotiations with Duchovny in the hopes that he would reprise his character for the finale. Initially, they were unsure if he would appear, but he eventually elected to return. Spotnitz said, [...] "My impression from talking to him was that he still cares about the show. He's still invested in it and certainly cares about [...] And I think he recognized that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> for the show and the audience [...] to come back and give closure to nine years of the series." [...] Not only did Duchovny return for the finale, he also returned to write and direct the episode [...] "William"; he even had a small cameo in the episode, appearing as a reflection in Scully's eye. Three episodes later, Duchovny returned as an actor for the season finale, [...] "The Truth".|$|E
500|$|The Beagle reached Ascension Island on 19 July 1836, and Darwin {{was delighted}} to receive letters from his sisters with news that Sedgwick had written [...] "He is doing admirably in S. America, & has already sent home a Collection above all praise.— <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> {{in the world for}} him that he went out on the Voyage of Discovery— There was some risk of his turning out an idle man: but his {{character}} will now be fixed, & if God spare his life, he will have a great name among the Naturalists of Europe." [...] Darwin later recalled how he [...] "clambered over the mountains... with a bounding step and made the volcanic rocks resound under my geological hammer!." [...] He agreed with the saying attributed to the people of St Helena that [...] "We know we live on a rock, but the poor people at Ascension live on a cinder", and noted the care taken to sustain [...] "houses, gardens & fields placed near the summit of the central mountain". (In the 1840s Darwin worked with Hooker, who proposed in 1847 that the Royal Navy import tree species, a project started in 1850 which {{led to the creation of}} an artificial cloud forest.) ...|$|E

2500|$|The Labour group, incensed {{at being}} caught off guard, took legal advice but {{were told that}} the budget as {{approved}} was [...] "more legal than not". The Conservative councillor who had led the initiative of calling the meeting claimed that Labour councillors had told him <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> to happen, as it removed the threat of disqualification and surcharge while allowing Labour to blame the Conservatives locally for any service cuts. However Ron Stockbridge subsequently resigned as council leader.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} the band got to the climactic piece [...] "Sing, Sing, Sing (With a Swing)", success was assured. This {{performance}} featured playing by the tenor saxophonist Babe Russin, the trumpeter Harry James, and Goodman, backed by the drummer Gene Krupa. When Goodman finished his solo, he unexpectedly gave a solo to the pianist, Jess Stacy. [...] "At the Carnegie Hall concert, after the usual theatrics, Jess Stacy was allowed to solo and, given the venue, what followed was appropriate," [...] wrote David Rickert. [...] "Used to just playing rhythm on the tune, he was unprepared for a turn in the spotlight, but what {{came out of his}} fingers was a graceful, impressionistic marvel with classical flourishes, yet still managed to swing. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> he ever did, and it's ironic that such a layered, nuanced performance came at the end of such a chaotic, bombastic tune." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{the praise}} from the England side, Pietersen {{claimed he was}} dropped from the Natal first team. Pietersen {{felt that this was}} due to the country's racial quota system, in which provincial sides were {{required}} to have at least four black players. Pietersen's view was that players should be judged on merit, and described it as [...] "heartbreaking" [...] when he was left out of the side, although he later reflected [...] "it turned out <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> that could have happened". Pietersen has since firmly criticised the quota system, which he feels forced him out of the country of his birth. He has also criticised Graeme Smith, who became captain of the South African side in 2003, calling him [...] "an absolute muppet, childish and strange" [...] and that his behaviour [...] "leaves a lot to be desired". Smith opposed this, saying, [...] "I'm patriotic about my country, and that's why I don't like Kevin Pietersen. The only reason that Kevin and I have never had a relationship is because he slated South Africa". Pietersen's outspoken views published in his autobiography, Crossing the Boundary, in September 2006, and in an interview for the South African edition of GQ magazine, led to unsuccessful calls for an ICC investigation regarding bringing the game into disrepute.|$|E
