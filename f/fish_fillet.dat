25|$|Filet-O-Fish – a <b>fish</b> <b>fillet</b> with tartar {{sauce and}} a half slice of cheese, on a steamed bun. It was {{introduced}} in Cincinnati in 1962 when {{it was discovered that}} many Roman Catholics chose to eat at Frisch's Big Boy on Fridays and during Lent, as it offered a fish sandwich so they could go without meat. This was replaced with the Fish Filet Deluxe in 1996 and brought back in 1998 albeit a larger fish patty. During the Easter period in Hawaii and Guam, a Double Filet-O-Fish meal is offered with two pieces of fish on one bun.|$|E
25|$|Cebiche, several {{historical}} sources {{claim that}} this dish originated about 2000 {{years ago in the}} ancient Moche culture. which had its capital south of the city of Trujillo. The dish is prepared using 5 basic ingredients: <b>fish</b> <b>fillet</b> cut in chunks with lemon, onion, salt and chili or chili Moche. The dish is added to a variety of ingredients to taste, one result of this combination is mixed cebiche. Fish that can be used are very diverse and include species of both freshwater and sea, also includes other seafood such as shellfish and seaweed and even vegetables. The dish can be accompanied by products such as sweet potatoes, boiled corn, cassava, lettuce leaves, roasted corn, etc. According to historical sources Peruvian ceviche had originated first in the Moche culture on the coast of its present territory for over two thousand years. Different chronicles report that along the Peruvian coast was consumed fish with salt and chili. This dish has been declared National Cultural Heritage by the Peruvian government.|$|E

40|$|In present {{research}} work, effect of edible and biodegradable protein dispersion coatings prepared from same fish and low cost fish (croaker fish) on chilled and frozen stored seer <b>fish</b> <b>fillets</b> on microbiological quality was studied. Washed meat of seer fish and croaker fish was converted into gels by lowering its pH with acetic acid. The gel dispersions were utilized as edible protein coatings after adjusting its pH to 3. 5 and apparent viscosity to 1 Pa s {{to enhance the}} shelf life of seer <b>fish</b> <b>fillets</b> during chilled and frozen storage. Seer <b>fish</b> <b>fillets</b> were coated with dispersions prepared from same fish or from low cost fish and microbiological quality changes occurred in chilled and frozen stored seer <b>fish</b> <b>fillets,</b> with or without protein dispersion coatings were studied. Protein dispersion coated seer <b>fish</b> <b>fillets</b> showed significantly enhanced microbiological quality as compared to fillets without coating and fillets with water glazing during frozen storage period of six months. No significant difference was observed in microbiological quality of seer fillets coated with protein dispersion prepared from same fish or from low cost fish. Hence, both these coatings {{can be used as}} natural and eco-friendly protection for chilled and frozen stored seer <b>fish</b> <b>fillets...</b>|$|R

5000|$|<b>Fish</b> <b>fillets</b> are {{generally}} obtained by slicing {{parallel to the}} spine, rather than perpendicular to the spine. Cuts of fish performed perpendicular to the spine are known as steaks or cutlets, and often include bone.

As opposed to whole fish or <b>fish</b> steaks, <b>fillets</b> do not contain the fish's backbone; they yield less flesh, but are easier to eat.|$|R
40|$|This paper summarises {{research}} and commercial developments in robotics for handling and processing tasks involving {{a high degree}} of variability. The variability is often derived from the characteristics of individual items to be processed e. g. natural product items such as meat portions or <b>fish</b> <b>fillets</b> which vary uniquely on an individual basis. Research into flexible knowledge-biled programming, sensor measurement, and sensor feedback to accommodate task variability is described. Example developed systems include scaled wall framing construction for domestic buildings using expert knowledge on building techniques, palletising of variable-size oil canisters, automated de-boning of <b>fish</b> <b>fillets,</b> and robotic cutting of lamb carcasses. The projects described were all carried out by members of the Advance...|$|R
