25|$|The {{round to}} egg-shaped seed {{capsules}} open when dry into two halves, exposing numerous small (0.5–1mm), brown seeds. If moisture is present the silique closes, protecting the seed and opening again upon dryness {{to allow for}} wind dispersal. Many species have a net-like pattern on their seed surface {{to allow them to}} land on water surfaces without sinking, since many non-epiphytic butterworts grow near water sources. The <b>haploid</b> <b>chromosome</b> number of butterworts is either n = 8 or n = 11 (or a multiple thereof), depending on species. The exception is P. lusitanica, whose chromosome count is n = 6.|$|E
2500|$|Gillenia has a <b>haploid</b> <b>chromosome</b> {{number of}} 9, while Maleae have a <b>haploid</b> <b>chromosome</b> number of 17 (which was {{probably}} produced from a Gillenia-like ancestor by doubling the genome and then losing a chromosome). Flower structure and fossil evidence {{also point to}} Gillenia sharing distinctive features with the Maleae. Another similarity between Gillenia and Maleae is susceptibility to Phragmidium fungus. [...] Differences between Gillenia and Maleae include the chromosome number and the latter being solely woody pome bearing plants, while Gillenia is herbaceous and has a dry follicular fruit.|$|E

The original <b>haploid</b> <b>chromosome</b> count of this complex is x=8. The diploid number is therefore 2n=16, whereas the tetraploid species B. liniflora is 2n=32.|$|E
2500|$|Flowers of Lacandonia [...] are {{bisexual}} and self-pollinate and fertilize {{before the}} flower opens (preanthesis cleistogamy). They are true flowers {{as opposed to}} pseudanthia as had been suggested earlier in the literature. The three-celled pollen grains germinate within the anthers and the pollen tube grows through the receptacle to reach the ovaries. L. schismatica can be found flowering year-round when its environment is moist enough, with a particularly active flowering period in November and December. Owing to the prenathesis cleistogamy, a form of autogamy (self-pollination), the known population of L. schismatica lacks genetic variability and has a high instance of homozygosity. The <b>haploid</b> <b>chromosome</b> number of this species is n=9.|$|E

2500|$|Fritillaria {{represents}} {{the most extreme}} case of genome size expansion in angiosperms. Polyploidy is rare, with nearly all species being diploid and only occasional reports of triploidy. Reported genome size in [...] Fritillaria vary from 1Cx (DNA content of unreplicated <b>haploid</b> <b>chromosome</b> complement) values of 30.15 to 85.38Gb (Giga base pairs), that is >190 {{times that of the}} so-called model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and >860 times that of Genlisea aurea, which {{represents the}} smallest land plant genome sequenced to date. Giant genome size is generally defined as >35pg (34Gb). The largest genomes in diploid Fritillaria are found in subgenus Japonica, exceeding 85Gb. At least one species, tetraplod F. assyriaca, has a very large genome. With approximately 127pg (130Gb), it was for a long time the largest known genome, exceeding the largest vertebrate animal genome known to date, that of the marbled lungfish (Protopterus aethiopicus), in size. Heterochromatin levels vary by biogeographic region, with very little in Old World and abundant levels in New World species. Most species have a basic chromosome number of x=12, but x=9, 11 and 13 have been reported.|$|E

50|$|Given {{a set of}} four or more sampled <b>haploid</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> the four-gamete test (FGT) detects {{recombination}} events by locating {{pairs of}} segregating sites that cannot have arisen without either recombination or a repeat mutation.

For example, if the data being studied consists of bi-allelic single-nucleotide polymorphism data, then the following configuration could be generated without recombination.|$|R

40|$|Adrogenesis, {{development}} from paternal but not maternal chromosomes, can be induced {{to occur in}} some organisms, including vertebrates, but has only been reported to occur naturally in interspecific hybrids of the Sicilian stick insect. Androgenesis has not been described previously in Drosophila. We now report the recovery of androgenetic offspring from Drosophila melanogaster females mutant for a gene that affects an oocyte- and embryo-specific alpha-tubulin. The androgenetic exceptions are X,X diploid females that develop from haploid embryos and express paternal markers on all 4 chromosomes. The exceptional females arise by fusion of haploid cleavage nuclei or failure of newly replicated <b>haploid</b> <b>chromosomes</b> to segregate, rather than fusion of two inseminating sperm. The frequency of androgenetic offspring is greatly enhanced by a partial loss-of-function mutant of the NCD (nonclaret disjunctional) microtubule motor protein, suggesting that wild-type NCD functions is pronuclear fusion. Diploidization of <b>haploid</b> paternal <b>chromosome</b> complements results in complete genetic homozygosity, which could facilitate studies of gene variation and mutational load in populations...|$|R
