25|$|Various {{methods have}} been used to {{identify}} imprinted genes. In swine, Bischoff et al. 2009 compared transcriptional profiles using short-oligonucleotide microarrays to survey differentially expressed genes between parthenotes (2 maternal genomes) and control fetuses (1 maternal, 1 paternal genome). An intriguing study surveying the transcriptome of murine brain tissues revealed over 1300 <b>imprinted</b> <b>gene</b> loci (approximately 10-fold more than previously reported) by RNA-sequencing from F1 hybrids resulting from reciprocal crosses. The result however has been challenged by others who claimed that this is an overestimation by an order of magnitude due to flawed statistical analysis.|$|E
25|$|Natural {{selection}} for genomic imprinting requires genetic variation in a population. A hypothesis for {{the origin of}} this genetic variation states that the host-defense system responsible for silencing foreign DNA elements, such as genes of viral origin, mistakenly silenced genes whose silencing turned out to be beneficial for the organism. There appears to be an over-representation of retrotransposed genes, that is to say genes that are inserted into the genome by viruses, among imprinted genes. It has also been postulated that if the retrotransposed gene is inserted close to another <b>imprinted</b> <b>gene,</b> it may just acquire this imprint.|$|E
40|$|The {{pattern of}} {{molecular}} evolution of <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> is controversial {{and the entire}} picture is still to be unveiled. Recently, {{a relationship between the}} formation of <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> and gene duplication was reported in genome-wide survey of <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> in Arabidopsis thaliana. Because gene duplications influence the molecular evolution of the duplicated gene family, it is necessary to investigate both the pattern of molecular evolution and the possible relationship between gene duplication and genomic imprinting for a better understanding of evolutionary aspects of <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes.</b> In this study, we investigated the evolutionary changes of type I MADS-box <b>genes</b> that include <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> by using relative species of Arabidopsis thaliana (two subspecies of A. lyrata and three subspecies of A. halleri). A duplicated gene family enables us to compare DNA sequences between <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> and its homologs. We found an increased number of gene duplications within species in clades containing the <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes,</b> further supporting the hypothesis that local gene duplication is one of the driving forces for the formation of <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes.</b> Moreover, data obtained by phylogenetic analysis suggested "rapid evolution" of not only <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> but also its closely related orthologous genes, which implies the effect of gene duplication on molecular evolution of <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Genomic {{imprinting}} is an epigenetic {{phenomenon that}} causes a differential expression of paternally and maternally inherited alleles of {{a subset of}} <b>genes</b> (the so-called <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes).</b> <b>Imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> are distributed throughout the genome and it is predicted that about 1 % of the human <b>genes</b> may be <b>imprinted.</b> It is recognized that the allelic expression of <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> varies between tissues and developmental stages. The current study represents the first attempt to estimate a prevalence of <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> within the total human transcriptome.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the epigenetic states and expression of <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> in five {{human embryonic stem}} cell (hESC) lines derived in Taiwan. METHODS: The heterozygous alleles of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> were analyzed by sequencing genomic DNAs of hESC lines and the monoallelic expression of the <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> were confirmed by sequencing the cDNAs. The expression profiles of 32 known <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> of five hESC lines were determined using Affymetrix human genome U 133 plus 2. 0 DNA microarray. RESULTS: The heterozygous alleles of SNPs at seven <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes,</b> IPW, PEG 10, NESP 55, KCNQ 1, ATP 10 A, TCEB 3 C and IGF 2, were identified and the monoallelic expression of these <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> except IGF 2 were confirmed. The IGF 2 gene {{was found to be}} imprinted in hESC line T 2 but partially imprinted in line T 3 and not imprinted in line T 4 embryoid bodies. Ten <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes,</b> namely GRB 10, PEG 10, SGCE, MEST, SDHD, SNRPN, SNURF, NDN, IPW and NESP 55, were found to be highly expressed in the undifferentiated hESC lines and down-regulated in differentiated derivatives. The UBE 3 A gene abundantly expressed in undifferentiated hESC lines and further up-regulated in differentiated tissues. The expression levels of other 21 <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> were relatively low in undifferentiated hESC lines and five of these genes (TP 73, COPG 2, OSBPL 5, IGF 2 and ATP 10 A) were found to be up-regulated in differentiated tissues. CONCLUSION: The epigenetic states and expression of <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> in hESC lines should be thoroughly studied after extended culture and upon differentiation in order to understand epigenetic stability in hESC lines before their clinical applications...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Dysregulation of <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes,</b> {{which are}} {{expressed}} in a parent-of-origin-specific manner, {{plays an important role}} in various human diseases, such as cancer and behavioral disorder. To date, however, fewer than 100 <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> have been identified in the human genome. The recent availability of high-throughput technology makes it possible to have large-scale prediction of <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes.</b> Here we propose a Bayesian model (dsPIG) to predict <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> on the basis of allelic expression observed in mRNA-Seq data of independent human tissues. Results Our model (dsPIG) was capable of identifying <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> with high sensitivity and specificity and a low false discovery rate when the number of sequenced tissue samples was fairly large, according to simulations. By applying dsPIG to the mRNA-Seq data, we predicted 94 <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> in 20 cerebellum samples and 57 <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> in 9 diverse tissue samples with expected low false discovery rates. We also assessed dsPIG using previously validated <b>imprinted</b> and non-imprinted <b>genes.</b> With simulations, we further analyzed how imbalanced allelic expression of non-imprinted genes or different minor allele frequencies affected the predictions of dsPIG. Interestingly, we found that, among biallelically expressed genes, at least 18 genes expressed significantly more transcripts from one allele than the other among different individuals and tissues. Conclusion With the prevalence of the mRNA-Seq technology, dsPIG has become a useful tool for analysis of allelic expression and large-scale prediction of <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes.</b> For ease of use, we have set up a web service and also provided an R package for dsPIG at [URL]. </p...|$|R

So far, 60 to 100 <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> have been identified in the human and mouse genomes, respectively. Identification of additional <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> has become increasingly important with the realization that imprinting defects are associated with complex disorders ranging from obesity to diabetes and behavioral disorders. Despite the importance <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> play in human health, few studies have undertaken genome-wide searches for new <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes.</b> These have used empirical approaches, with some success. However, computational prediction of novel <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> has recently come to the forefront. I have developed generalized linear models using data on a variety of sequence and epigenetic features within a training set of known <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes.</b> The resulting models were used to predict novel <b>imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> in the mouse genome. After imposing a stringency threshold, I compiled an initial candidate list of 155 genes. A subset of these genes was tested for evidence of imprinting using allele-specific restriction digests in either brain or placenta.

40|$|<b>Imprinted</b> <b>genes</b> {{represent}} a curious defiance of normal Mendelian genetics.
