50|$|Gnopernicus was bundled as the <b>default</b> <b>screen</b> reader on GNOME 2.4 on September 10, 2003; {{however, the}} {{development}} of Gnopernicus was started in 2001. Orca, with its radical different coding approach of making applications accessible, had more flexibility than the original Gnopernicus design and replaced it as the <b>default</b> <b>screen</b> reader in GNOME 2.16 in September 2006.|$|E

50|$|As of GNOME 2.16, Orca is the <b>default</b> <b>screen</b> {{reader of}} the GNOME platform, {{replacing}} Gnopernicus. As a result, Orca follows the GNOME stable release cycles of approximately six-months. Orca is provided by default {{on a number of}} operating system distributions, including Solaris, Fedora, openSUSE and Ubuntu.|$|E

5000|$|From this device's <b>default</b> home <b>screen,</b> {{the user}} can check the weather, play songs, update CNN headlines, view photos, {{configure}} device settings, {{and go to}} social-networking sites like Facebook, Myspace, and YouTube. However, if the home screen is changed from [...] (which is the <b>default</b> home <b>screen</b> layout) to other layouts (like [...] ), these features will be unavailable until the home screen layout is changed back to the default.|$|R
5000|$|The Commodities {{directory}} (volume SYS:Tools/Commodities/ or SYS:Utilities/Commodities under AmigaOS4) contains executable applet-like utilities which enhance system usability, {{like for}} example the ScreenBlanker, the <b>default</b> <b>screen</b> saver shipped with AmigaOS. Commodities are usually loaded at system startup. Many require no interaction and do not feature any GUI interface.|$|E
50|$|Tahoma was the <b>default</b> <b>screen</b> font used by Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 (replacing MS Sans Serif) and {{was also}} used for Skype and Sega's Dreamcast {{packaging}} and promotional material. Bundled in the font library of Windows, the typeface was widely used {{as an alternative to}} Arial.|$|E
50|$|Technically the {{standard}} HIRES graphics mode on the C128 {{was the same}} as on the C64 except that the default address in RAM where videoram (HIRES colors) are stored on the C128 directly preceded the <b>default</b> <b>screen</b> address (unlike the C64). This made loading a single BSAVE graphic file in either a monochrome or color format (of the uncompressed type produced by DOODLE) possible on the C128.|$|E
30|$|The {{decision}} tree builds on, and is consistent with, existing approaches for mixture and combined exposures {{proposed by the}} WHO/IPCS, the European Commission, and other organizations. The {{decision tree}} is intended to address {{a wide range of}} combined exposures that include exposures to multiple chemicals from single or multiple sources that occur over time. The decision tree adopts precautionary assumptions to account for known sources of uncertainty. For example, the model follows the WHO/IPCS and European Commission SCs in adopting additive models as a <b>default</b> <b>screening</b> assumption when MoA information is not available on the relevant chemicals.|$|R
5000|$|Two extra cheat codes {{were added}} to the Famicom version: a stage select code (since the setting is not {{available}} on the <b>default</b> option <b>screen)</b> and a code that increases the number of continues.|$|R
50|$|Although most mobile {{operating}} systems include a <b>default</b> home <b>screen,</b> some devices also allow {{the user to}} replace the native home screen with a different application or third-party home screen, allowing for additional home screen paradigms.|$|R
50|$|Aside {{from its}} {{built-in}} features and different form factor, {{there are several}} other differences between the SX-64 and the regular C64. The <b>default</b> <b>screen</b> color is changed to blue text on a white background for improved readability on the smaller screen. This can cause compatibility problems with programs that assume the C64's default blue background. The default device for load and save operations is changed to the floppy drive.|$|E
5000|$|On the Commodore 64, {{entering}} [...] will {{flood the}} screen with garbage instead of loading the directory into BASIC RAM. This is because the drive assigns the directory a load address of $0401 (1025), which {{is equivalent to the}} start of BASIC for the Commodore PET, but corresponds to the <b>default</b> <b>screen</b> memory in the C64 (starting with the second character on the first line of the screen).|$|E
50|$|However, {{because only}} 2 colors could {{be stored in}} the {{standard}} memory area shared by HIRES mode, a separate area of RAM was used to store the other two colors which was not contiguous with the <b>default</b> <b>screen</b> address and which was fixed (even the C128). This meant that a separate BSAVE file containing the remaining 2 colors was required to BSAVE and BLOAD these on the C128 (keeping {{in mind that the}} C64 did not support the BSaved format).|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the relationship between bank risk and product diversification in the changing structure of the European banking industry. Based on a broad set of European banks for the period 1996 - 2002, our study shows that banks expanding into non-interest income activities present higher risk than banks which mainly supply loans. Whereas previous studies (mainly on U. S. banks) focused on portfolio diversification effects we explore risk implications of cross-selling determinants of loan pricing as an alternative explanation. Our results show that higher income from other activities is associated with lower lending rates which suggests that banks may actually use loans as a loss leader altering <b>default</b> <b>screening</b> and monitoring activities and consequently risk pricing. JEL classification: G 2...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{implications}} on bank interest {{margins of the}} expansion into non- traditional fee-based activities in European banking. We use a sample of 602 European commercial and cooperative banks from 1996 to 2002 and consider the total income shares of trading income and commission and fee income as measures of product diversification to explore loan pricing. Our results show that a higher income share from commission and fee activities is associated with lower margins and lower lending rates but {{that there is no}} link with trading activities. For banks exhibiting a higher share of commission and fee income there is a weaker link between the rate they charge on loans and borrower default risk. The hypothesis that banks use loans as a loss leader altering <b>default</b> <b>screening</b> and monitoring activities and consequently risk pricing cannot be rejected...|$|R

5000|$|... fold is a Unix command {{used for}} making a file with long lines more {{readable}} on a limited width terminal. Most Unix terminals have a <b>default</b> <b>screen</b> width of 80, and therefore reading files with long lines could get annoying. The fold command puts a line feed every X characters {{if it does not}} reach a new line before that point. If the [...] argument is set, the fold command allows the user to set the maximum length of a line.|$|E
50|$|Many dive {{computers}} have menus, various selectable options and various display modes, which {{are controlled by}} {{a small number of}} buttons. Control of the computer display differs between manufacturers and in some cases between models by the same manufacturer. The diver may need information not displayed on the <b>default</b> <b>screen</b> during a dive, and the button sequence to access the information may not be immediately obvious. If the diver becomes familiar with the control of the computer on dives where the information is not critical before relying on it for more challenging dives there is less risk of confusion which may lead to an accident.|$|E
50|$|Because of the dispute, WTMJ {{replaced}} TheCoolTV {{with the}} Live Well Network on October 1 (WGBA, meanwhile, {{replaced it with}} Me-TV on that date). WTMJ eventually converted the channel's aspect ratio to 480i widescreen, optimized for 16:9 displays, in line with LWN's <b>default</b> <b>screen</b> presentation; select Live Well programming (consisting of Motion and Deals) was broadcast in high definition during Saturday late night slots on the station's main channel until the network was removed. On January 12, 2015, one week before Live Well Network was to originally discontinue operations entirely (its distribution would instead be relegated exclusively to ABC Owned Television Stations outlets after a three-month reprieve from its planned nationwide shutdown), it was replaced on WTMJ-DT3 with the NBC-owned subchannel service Cozi TV.|$|E
50|$|All {{versions}} of Microsoft Windows feature a boot screen, which is loaded during the startup process. With extra, third-party utilities, {{it is possible}} to replace the <b>default</b> Windows boot <b>screen</b> with custom images, text, and/or animations.|$|R
5000|$|The {{included}} [...] "F-BASIC" [...] is {{an enhanced}} version of Microsoft's Color BASIC. F-BASIC's {{additions to the}} standard Microsoft CoCo BASIC include the Japanese character set (katakana, and a few kanji), block graphics, three-voice music, the ability to have graphics appear on the <b>default</b> text <b>screen,</b> and some neat commands such as {{being able to take}} any string and print it out in various sizes (from tiny to huge) and directions (forward, backward, up, down, etc.).|$|R
50|$|The <b>default</b> home <b>screen</b> of Eclair {{displays}} a persistent Google Search bar {{across the top}} of the screen. The camera app was also redesigned with numerous new camera features, including flash support, digital zoom, scene mode, white balance, color effect and macro focus. The photo gallery app also contains basic photo editing tools. This version also included the addition of live wallpapers, allowing the animation of home-screen background images to show movement. Speech-to-text was first introduced, replacing the comma key.|$|R
5000|$|Announced in April 2013 for the 2013 HTC One; it {{features}} a more minimalistic design and a new scrolling news aggregator on the home screen known as [...] "BlinkFeed", which displays a scrolling grid of news headlines and social network content. By default, Sense 5 uses three home screen pages: two with the traditional grid for apps and widgets (as with previous devices, but using a grid with fewer spaces for apps by default), and the <b>default</b> <b>screen</b> with a redesigned clock and BlinkFeed, although more pages can still be added. Sense 5.0 was not {{only going to be}} exclusive to the HTC One; on February 28, 2013, HTC announced that it would provide updates for the Butterfly, One S (later discontinued), and the One X/X+ to Sense 5.0 in the coming months.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the pattern of}} head growth and the early postnatal nutritional status of microcephalic infants in a low-income country. Materials and Methods: A cohort study in Lagos, Nigeria in which the head growth of full-term singletons within the first postnatal check-up at 6 - 8 weeks was evaluated using the latest World Health Organization (WHO) ’s Child Growth Standards (WHO-CGS) for head circumference. Nutritional status of microcephalic infants at follow-up was also determined after adjustments for potential confounders. Results: Of the 452 infants (male: 227) enrolled, microcephalic infants were 32 (7. 1 %) at birth and 34 (7. 5 %) at follow-up. However, while 401 (88. 7 %) remained normocephalic and 15 (3. 3 %) remained microcephalic at follow-up, 19 (4. 2 %) became microcephalic and 17 (3. 8 %) became normocephalic. Microcephalic infants were significantly underweight (P < 0. 001), stunted (P < 0. 001) and wasted (P < 0. 001) at follow-up. Conclusions: Regardless of their status at birth, microcephalic infants at 6 - 8 weeks {{are likely to be}} undernourished by all nutritional indices suggesting that head circumference may serve as a complementary or <b>default</b> <b>screening</b> tool for early detection of undernourished infants in resource-constrained settings...|$|R
