40|$|In {{microsystems}} technology suitable microjoint {{mechanisms are}} required {{in order to}} transfer the work of microactuators into directed forces and motions. In this work this problem is solved by making use of the hydraulic principle of spider leg extension, which is implemented in active microjoints. Due to the high power density of fluidic actuators a compact design become possible. Such active microjoints are very promising for use in microsystems technology, since they can be arranged as basic modules in series or in parallel to complex motion systems, which can be controlled by micropumps and microvalves. In order to gain better insight, a model is developed for simulation of the dynamic behavior of a revolute joint mechanism taking into account damping and frictional forces. The dynamics of the contact point and the center of gravity of the <b>joint</b> <b>lever</b> is analysed for different circular and elliptical joint geometries of millimeter size in the presence of gravitation. It is demonstrated that by geometry variation the frictional work can be reduced at least by 10 %, which is an important criterion for the optimisation of such an element. The technical feasibility of fluidic microjoints is investigated and a concept for fabrication is worked out for prototypes of dimensions 1 x 1 x 6 mm" 3. The metallic levers of the joint mechanism are manufactured with an accuracy of #+-# 5 #mu#m by electron-discharge machining. The high wettability of liquid SIR enables the fabrication of a flexible hinge by a vacuum casting process, whereby the anchoring structure with minimum gap width of 85 #mu#m can be filled up in a reproducible manner. The thin-walled capsule of the microjoint is fabricated by a blow moulding process. During shaping, the wall thickness of the tubular parison is reduced from 100 to 50 #mu#m. Alternatively, some other technologies like a process with lost cores, dip coating and injection molding with inlays are investigated. Furthermore, a non-positive joint is designed as a further linking mechanism in addition to positive joints and flexible hinges. In experimental investigations the elastic bending behavior of the hinge and the joint capsule are characterised by force-displacement measurements. The hinges of SIR allow a rotating movement of about 45, which requires maximum bending forces of about 0, 5 - 3 mN {{depending on the type of}} SIR and the deformation velocity. In order to fold the blown capsule, bending forces of about 5 mN are required. The pneumatic driving forces are measured during lever extension display a maximum value of about 16 mN for a pressure difference of 1000 hPa. The corresponding displacement of the lever tip is about 1, 8 mm. (orig.) Dissertation submitted by M.

The sole reliance on the hip joint to control the entire prosthetic limb makes fine-tuning foot placement difficult.

30|$|An XY flexure-based nano-manipulator is {{presented}} in this paper. Two PEAs are employed to generate actuations and the cross-axis couplings are attenuated in the kinematic chains. The flexure hinges, arranged in SIS configurations, function as prismatic and revolute <b>joints.</b> <b>Lever</b> mechanism is utilized to magnify the displacement of the PEA. It is found that the lever’s compliance may significantly affect the estimated parameters of the nano-manipulator, such as the input/output stiffness and the first natural frequency. In this paper, a criterion is proposed {{to decide whether the}} lever’s compliance can be neglected or not. The lever’s compliance can be modeled by cascading a linear spring {{at the end of the}} lever. Although simple in formulation, this methodology is effective in improving the modeling accuracy, as verified through experimental results.|$|R

40|$|Being {{part of the}} Elopomorph {{group of}} fishes, Anguillidae species have a leptocephalus larval stage. Unfortunately, due to (mostly) unknown deep-water marine birthplaces, a {{catadromous}} lifestyle, and a transparent body morphology, these Anguilla larvae are rarely encountered in nature. Therefore, information regarding the early development of these larvae, including the exogenous feeding strategy and feeding performance, is rather scarce. To get some insight into these early ontogenetic changes and their influence on the functionality of the developing feeding apparatus, an ontogenetic series is put together from two artificially bred Anguillids. Throughout this series, graphical three-dimensional reconstructions (based on histological sections) of the musculoskeletal system of European (Anguilla anguilla) and Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica) larvae provide detailed descriptions of the changing feeding apparatus. Subsequently, theoretical bite forces are calculated for every reconstructed phase, using 3 D data of <b>joints,</b> <b>levers,</b> and muscles derived from these reconstructions. Although the expected increase in bite force is observed with progressing age of the larvae, the obtained forces remain rather small (several µN).

40|$|Being {{part of the}} elopomorph {{group of}} fishes, Anguillidae species show a leptocephalus larval stage. However, due to largely unknown {{spawning}} locations and habitats of their earliest life stages, {{as well as their}} transparency, these Anguilla larvae are rarely encountered in nature. Therefore, information regarding the early life history of these larvae, including their exogenous feeding strategy and feeding performance, is rather scarce. To better understand the structural basis and functional performance of larval feeding in captivity, the functional morphology of the cranial musculoskeletal system in pre- and first-feeding engyodontic leptocephali of the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) was studied. A 3 D reconstruction of the feeding apparatus (head of the leptocephali < 1 mm) was used to visualize and describe the musculoskeletal changes throughout these stages. To analyze the ontogenetic changes in the functionality of the feeding apparatus towards the active feeding phase, 3 D data of <b>joints,</b> <b>levers</b> and muscles derived from the reconstructions were used to estimate bite and joint reaction forces (JRFs). Observing a maximum estimated bite force of about 65 lN (and corresponding JRFs of 260 lN), it can be hypothesized that leptocephalus larvae are functionally constrained to feed only on soft food particles. Additionally, potential prey items are size delimited, based on the theoretically estimated average gape of these larvae of about 100 lm. This hypothesis appears to be in line with recent observations of a diet consisting of small and/or gelatinous prey items (Hydrozoa, Thaliacea, Ctenophora, Polycystenia) found in the guts of euryodontic leptocephalus larvae...|$|R
40|$|Being {{part of the}} elopomorph {{group of}} fishes, Anguillidae species have a leptocephalus larval stage. These larvae have a transparent, {{elongated}} and laterally compressed body, as well as needle-like prognathous teeth. Information regarding the physiology, morphology, ecology and behavior of these Anguilla larvae is available in literature for specimens caught during their catadromous migration. Unfortunately, due to deep-water marine birthplaces and {{the fragility of the}} organisms, information regarding the early development of these larvae, including the feeding strategy at the onset of exogenous feeding and their general feeding performance, is rather scarce. To get some insight into these early ontogenetic changes and their influence on the functionality of the developing feeding apparatus, an ontogenetic series is put together from artificially bred European (Anguilla anguilla) and Japanese (Anguilla japonica) eel larvae. Graphical three-dimensional reconstructions (based on histological sections) of the musculoskeletal system provide detailed descriptions of the changing feeding apparatus throughout the early ontogenetic stages. These reconstructions allow not only to compare the early development of both species, but also to obtain an estimation on the theoretical bite forces (using 3 D data of <b>joints,</b> <b>levers,</b> and muscles derived from the reconstructions) these early larvae can generate. Three larval stages, representing the transition from endogenous to exogenous feeding, are investigated in both A. anguilla and A. japonica. Although the exogenous feeding larvae of A. japonica are younger (days post hatching) and even smaller (total length) than the endogenous feeding larvae of A. anguilla, both species undergo similar morphological changes in their musculoskeletal topography of the feeding apparatus throughout the transition. As a result, bite forces obtained in an exogenously feeding larva of A. anguilla are comparable to forces calculated for an exogenously feeding larva of A. japonica. Although an increase in bite force is observed with progressing age of the larvae in both species, the obtained forces remain rather small (several µN). Combined with a rather limited gape angle (several 100 µm), these leptocephalus larvae are hypothesized to be anatomically constrained to feed only on soft and/or small food particles. This hypothesis is in line with the retrieval of small and/or gelatinous prey items (Hydrozoa, Thaliacea, Ctenophora, Polycystenia) in the guts of leptocephali captured in nature...|$|R

40|$|For {{analysing}} the ligaments of {{the ankle}} joint, their function, and the traumatic mechanisms which {{cause them to}} rupture, an apparatus was developed which enables graphic registration of rotatory movements in the ankle joint in two planes simultaneously, when a given torque {{is applied to the}} talus. In a modified form, this apparatus is applicable also for other <b>joints.</b> A <b>lever</b> with strain gauges and potentiometers is fixed in the talus of an osteoligamentous preparation. The lever is moved manually, and signals from the strain gauges and potentiometers are collected by a microcomputer for later transfer to a computer service centre where the mobility at the chosen torque is calculated and plotted as mobility patterns. The appearance of these patterns depends upon which ligaments are intact. The patterns plotted in any situation are reproducible, provided that the state of the ligaments is unchanged. In cutting experiments it was possible to demonstrate that rupture of the anterior talofibular ligament may occur simultaneously with partial rupture of the posterior talofibular ligament, although the calcaneofibular ligament remains intact. This occurs if the distortion trauma causing the rupture consists of an internal rotation of the talus, not if it consists mainly of a tilting of the talus in the ankle mortise...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is composed}} of three research papers that deal with the topic of “accounting and innovation” and provide evidence for the area of innovation from two accounting perspectives, i. e., the external disclosure perspective and the internal management control system perspective. The disclosure perspective is addressed in the first paper. Using content analysis, it examines the innovation capital disclosure characteristics, i. e., disclosure quantity and quality, in intellectual capital statements of 51 European for-profit firms. Additionally, the relationship between innovation capital disclosure characteristics and industry, firm size, region of domicile, and disclosure guidelines adopted are analyzed. The second and third paper address the management control system perspective. The second paper contributes to the research on management control systems in product development by exploring the performance effects and the interplay of the levers of control, i. e., interactive, diagnostic, beliefs, and boundary control systems, {{based on data from}} a survey of 468 senior managers from the manufacturing industry. Therefore, I compare by structural equation modeling a base model of unrelated levers of control (additive model) with (a) a model of mutual association of levers of control (interdependence model), (b) a model of <b>joint</b> use of <b>levers</b> of control (interaction model), and (c) a combined model of mutual association and <b>joint</b> use of <b>levers</b> of control (combined interdependence/interaction model). The best fitting and most parsimonious model is analyzed in terms of the performance effects of the levers of control. Based on the sample of the second paper, the third paper contributes to the recent literature on the relationship between management control systems and innovation by considering how the four levers of control are used as “packages” in product development. I employ cluster analysis to determine how the levers of control are combined, {{depending on the type of}} strategy formation (i. e., intended or emergent) and the degree of innovativeness of the firm. Furthermore, I explore which of these combinations are equifinal in terms of product development and organizational performance...|$|R

Wheelchair prescription involves reconfiguring the wheelchair to optimize it for specific user characteristics. Wheelchair tuning procedure is a complicated task that is performed usually by experienced rehabilitation engineers. In this study, we report initial results from {{the development of a}} musculoskeletal model of the wheelchair lever propulsion. Such a model could be used for the development of new advanced wheelchair approaches that allow wheelchair designers and practitioners to explore virtually, on a computer, the effects of the intended settings of the lever-propulsion interface. To investigate the lever-propulsion process, we carried out wheelchair lever propulsion experiments where <b>joint</b> angle, <b>lever</b> angle and three-directional forces and moments applied to the lever were recorded during the execution of defined propulsion motions. Kinematic and dynamic features of lever propulsion motions were extracted from the recorded data to be used for the model development. Five healthy male adults took part in these initial experiments. The analysis of the collected kinematic and dynamic motion parameters showed that lever propulsion is realized by a cyclical three-dimensional motion of upper extremities and that joint torque for propulsion is maintained within a certain range. The synthesized propulsion model was verified by computer simulation where the measured lever-angles were compared with the angles generated by the developed model simulation. Joint torque amplitudes were used to impose the torque limitation to the model joints. The results evidenced that the developed model can simulate successfully basic lever propulsion tasks such as pushing and pulling the lever...|$|R

40|$|A {{computer-based}} pre- and post-operative {{analysis of}} total hip replacement (THR) is presented. The {{analysis was performed}} by using and innovative combination of X-ray measurements and gait analysis. The several important biomechanical factors that affect effective THR are analysed in a test clinical case of conversion of hip fusion into THR. Geometrical positioning of the artificial joint should restore correct motion and adequate leverage of the surrounding muscles in order to exert the appropriate functional joint moments. Hip joint centre positioning pre- and post-operation was evaluated using a computer-based X-ray measurement tool.

Pre- and post-operative function was also evaluated using gait analysis, including joint kinematics, kinetics and electromyography.

40|$|It is {{estimated}} that 25 million {{people around the world}} suffer from upper limb amputation. 82 % of these amputees live in developing countries and usually find it difficult to provide for their families because they depend on physical labor. At first glance {{it would seem that the}} solution is simple, the use of a prosthesis. However currently available upper limb prostheses are beyond the capabilities of most of the people in the developing countries. Thus there is a need for a prosthesis that can be easily manufactured in the developing countries and which is affordable for the individuals. Bamboo is a material that can be found in most developing countries, it has a good combination of properties such as specific strength and specific stiffness. Therefore, the goal of this research project is to make a body powered hand prosthesis out of bamboo. The prosthesis uses a combination of levers to move and to provide high gripping force with a low actuation force. However, the results show that there is a high energy loss occurring at the <b>joints</b> of the <b>levers.</b> Furthermore, the operating force is high (120 N) and the grasping force is low (14 N). However, by adjusting the position of the cable and spring the operating force can be reduced while the grasping force is increased.

The same authors also suggested that lever propulsion could be applicable {{to a wide range of}} individuals because the mechanical efficiency remains slightly affected by the changes of the seat positions. Hughes et al. compared the patterns of changing the shoulder and elbow <b>joint</b> angles during <b>lever</b> propulsion and handrim propulsion at various seat positions and demonstrated that joint angles during handrim propulsion experiment change in much bigger range [11]. This result was supported by the findings of Brubaker et al. [1].

These results suggested that lever propulsion may mitigate the risk of secondary joint disorders. Jordon Lui et al. compared the energy efficiency of two commercially available lever propulsion wheelchair mechanisms with those of a handrim mechanism.
