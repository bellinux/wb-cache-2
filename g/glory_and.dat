5|$|After Michaels {{took time}} off to have knee surgery for a {{legitimate}} injury suffered prior to SummerSlam (he noticeably limped to the ring and the pre-match attack where Hercules {{hit him in the}} knee with his chain was so that Michaels would not actually have to wrestle), his return saw The Rockers continue to feud with Power and <b>Glory,</b> <b>and</b> the teams faced each other during an elimination match at the 1990 Survivor Series. Power and Glory's team won the match, during which Roma eliminated Michaels after performing a PowerPlex with Hercules.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the revolt}} was quickly suppressed, exaggerated reports of {{disaster}} prompted Mucianus to depart the capital with reinforcements of his own. Domitian eagerly sought {{the opportunity to}} attain military <b>glory</b> <b>and</b> joined the other officers {{with the intention of}} commanding a legion of his own. According to Tacitus, Mucianus was not keen on this prospect but since he considered Domitian a liability in any capacity that was entrusted to him, he preferred to keep him close at hand rather than in Rome.|$|E

5|$|Back at Rome, Tiberius instituted the Sodales Augustales, a priesthood of {{the cult}} of Augustus which Germanicus became a member of. When news arrived of his raid, Tiberius commemorated his {{services}} in the Senate with elaborate, but insincere praise: the proceedings gave him joy that the mutiny had been suppressed, but anxiety at the <b>glory</b> <b>and</b> popularity afforded to Germanicus. The Senate, in absence of Germanicus, voted {{that he should be}} given a triumph. Ovid's Fasti dates the Senate vote of Germanicus' triumph to 1 January AD 15.|$|E

5|$|In 1918, {{novelist and}} playwright George Cram Cook {{produced}} his first full-length play, The Athenian Women (an adaption of Lysistrata), which portrays Aspasia leading a strike for peace. Cook combined an anti-war theme with a Greek setting. American writer Gertrude Atherton in The Immortal Marriage (1927) treats {{the story of}} Pericles and Aspasia and illustrates {{the period of the}} Samian War, the Peloponnesian War and the Plague of Athens. Taylor Caldwell's <b>Glory</b> <b>and</b> the Lightning (1974) is another novel that portrays the historical relationship of Aspasia and Pericles.|$|E

5|$|Gilbert's {{first years}} as earl were {{predominantly}} {{concerned with the}} Scottish Wars. He had no personal interest in the region, but the Welsh Marches, where his landed interest lay, were largely pacified at the time, and Scotland presented {{a good opportunity to}} pursue military <b>glory</b> <b>and</b> reward. He was almost immediately trusted with important military commands on the northern border, and served as warden of Scotland from 1308 to 1309, and as captain of Scotland and the northern marches in 1309. He led an expedition to relieve the castle of Rutherglen in December 1308. The war effort, however, was not pursued with the same intensity by EdwardII as it had been by his father. The new king's neglect of the Scottish Wars allowed Robert the Bruce to regain the initiative in the war.|$|E
5|$|His {{marriage}} to the hot-tempered Sarah Jennings – Anne's intimate friend – ensured Marlborough's rise, first to the Captain-Generalcy of British forces, then to a dukedom. Becoming de facto leader of Allied forces during the War of the Spanish Succession, his victories on the fields of Blenheim (1704), Ramillies (1706), Oudenarde (1708), and Malplaquet (1709), ensured {{his place in history}} as one of Europe's great generals. But his wife's stormy relationship with the Queen, and her subsequent dismissal from court, was central to his own fall. Incurring Anne's disfavour, and caught between Tory and Whig factions, Marlborough, who had brought <b>glory</b> <b>and</b> success to Anne's reign, was forced from office and went into self-imposed exile. He returned to England and to influence under the House of Hanover with the accession of GeorgeI to the British throne in 1714.|$|E

5|$|Rommel was {{an ambitious}} {{man who took}} {{advantage}} of his proximity to Hitler and willingly accepted the propaganda campaigns designed for him by Goebbels. He sought {{to level the playing}} field for non-nobles, and also supported militarism and a strong German Empire, while treating people only according to their merits. He did not display hatred to people of noble descent, and in fact was a throwback to the medieval knight in his personal traits, appearing well-versed in the ancient customs of chivalry, which helped to attract admiration from the British who saw in him a romantic archetype. Rommel classed himself as a traditionalist regarding military ethics and a modernist regarding warfare techniques. Certain authors remark that he also sought military <b>glory</b> <b>and</b> personal recognition, most of all from Hitler on whom, according to Watson, Rommel projected his idea of the German people's will.|$|E
5|$|A {{long period}} of peace between Parthia and Rome ensued, with only the {{invasion}} of Alans into Parthia's eastern territories around 72AD mentioned by Roman historians. Whereas Augustus and Nero had chosen a cautious military policy when confronting Parthia, later Roman emperors invaded and attempted to conquer the eastern Fertile Crescent, {{the heart of the}} Parthian Empire along the Tigris and Euphrates. The heightened aggression can be explained in part by Rome's military reforms. To match Parthia's strength in missile troops and mounted warriors, the Romans at first used foreign allies (especially Nabataeans), but later established a permanent auxilia force to complement their heavy legionary infantry. The Romans eventually maintained regiments of horse archers (sagittarii) and even mail-armored cataphracts in their eastern provinces. Yet the Romans had no discernible grand strategy in dealing with Parthia and gained very little territory from these invasions. The primary motivations for war were the advancement of the personal <b>glory</b> <b>and</b> political position of the emperor, as well as defending Roman honor against perceived slights such as Parthian interference in the affairs of Rome's client states.|$|E

5|$|Almost all of Manila's prewar and Spanish colonial {{architecture}} {{were destroyed}} during its battle for liberation by the intensive bombardment of the United States Air Force during World War II.

McBreen completed 2009–10 with another A-League club, Perth <b>Glory,</b> <b>and</b> his good form with them resulted in a call-up to the Australia national team.
