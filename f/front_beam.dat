50|$|Triple {{beam balance}} is an {{instrument}} {{used to measure}} mass very precisely. The device has reading error of +/- 0.05 gram. The name refers to the three beams including the middle beam {{which is the largest}} size, the <b>front</b> <b>beam</b> which is the medium size, and the far beam which is the smallest size. The difference in size of the beams indicate the difference in weights and reading scale that each beam carry. The reading scale can be enumerated that the middle beam reads in 100 gram increments, the <b>front</b> <b>beam</b> can read from 0 to 10 grams, and the far beam can read in 10 gram increments. The triple beam balance can be used to measure mass directly from the objects, find mass by difference for liquid, and measure out a substance.|$|E
5000|$|As cars {{increased}} in speed after World War I, {{the use of}} a dropped <b>front</b> <b>beam</b> axle became almost universal, so as to lower the mass of their heavy front-mounted engines, improving stability when cornering. Rear axles were also beam axles, but needed to remain straight as they contained the halfshafts.|$|E
50|$|The SuperSteer {{front axle}} reduces the turn {{radius of the}} tractor. The <b>front</b> axle <b>beam</b> turns with the wheels to give an {{effective}} turn angle of 65°. The tractor turns tighter and faster so it spends less time turning and more time working. The SuperSteer front axle also increases the wheelbase, {{with the weight of}} the front ballast resting directly on the <b>front</b> axle <b>beam.</b> Traction is enhanced in certain conditions without need for extra ballast.|$|R

5000|$|Triple {{beam balance}} is an {{instrument}} {{used to measure}} mass very precisely. The device has reading error of +/- 0.05 gram. The name refers to the three beams including the middle beam {{which is the largest}} size, the <b>front</b> <b>beam</b> which is the medium size, and the far beam which is the smallest size [...] The difference in size of the beams indicate the difference in weights and reading scale that each beam carry.

5000|$|The car {{featured}} a Siemens and Halske-built [...] overhead valve W6 engine, with three banks of paired cylinders, all {{working on a}} common crankshaft. Producing , it was mounted {{just ahead of the}} rear axle. The engine, transmission, and final drive were assembled together and installed as a unit. The rear swing axles were suspended by trailing leaf springs, while the <b>front</b> <b>beam</b> axle was suspended by leading leaf springs.|$|E
50|$|A {{ladder frame}} was used. The <b>front</b> <b>beam</b> axle was mounted on leaf springs, the rear tandem beam axles were {{mounted on a}} leaf sprung “walking beam” type suspension. All models shared a 181 in {{wheelbase}} (measured from 1st to 3rd axles). Full air drum brakes were used, M123s were {{able to control the}} trailer brakes independently of the tractor. M125s had electrical connections for the artillery piece brakes. Tire size was 14.00x24.|$|E
50|$|Looking {{to improve}} the {{handling}} of the Austin 7, in 1933 Leslie Ballamy (1904 - 1991) split the <b>front</b> <b>beam</b> axle into twin swing arms that pivoted from a central joint. It is for this simple innovation that Ballamy became renowned. Soon afterwards, he put into production his swing axles for the Austin and the Ford 8, 10 and V8 models. Ballamy also converted more up-market cars such as Allard, Bugatti, Delage and Bentley.|$|E
40|$|In plasma wakefield accelerators, long (as {{compared}} to the wakefield period) driving beams {{are subject to the}} vig-orous transverse two-stream instability, the nonlinear stage of which is numerically studied. If only one mode of the instability grows up in the system (as {{in the case of a}} sharp <b>beam</b> <b>front),</b> then the <b>beam</b> quickly gets modulated, the in-stability saturates, and the generated wakefield increases; further propagation of the modulated beam is stable. Si-multaneous growth of several unstable modes (which is the case for a smooth <b>beam</b> <b>front)</b> completely destroys the beam in the time of several betatron oscillations. The trains of short bunches are stable. ...|$|R

50|$|Under the Ulster Transport Authority, {{the engines}} were painted black with {{vermilion}} and yellow lining. Buffer beams, {{name and number}} plate backgrounds were red {{and the practice of}} putting the number on the <b>front</b> buffer <b>beam</b> was continued.|$|R
50|$|The {{adoption}} of a <b>front</b> <b>beam</b> axle {{in place of a}} system incorporating independent front suspension that had featured on its UK predecessor might have been seen as a backward step by some, but on the road commentators felt that the Transit's wider track and longer wheelbase more than compensated for the apparent step backwards represented by Ford's suspension choices. Drivers appreciated the elimination of the excessive noise, smell and cabin heat that resulted from placing the driver above or adjacent to the engine compartment in the Thames 400E and other forward control light vans of the 1950s and early 1960s.|$|E
50|$|This was {{the first}} Bentley to {{dispense}} with a leaf-sprung <b>front</b> <b>beam</b> axle. It followed Rolls-Royce's lead from 1936 and instead used a new design of independent front suspension in its completely new chassis. Low rate open coil springs sat within pairs of triangulated wishbones holding the front wheels at their outer point. The upper wishbones acted on a piston-type hydraulic damper, the arms at the bottom were set wide apart so that the rearward one could act as a torque member under braking. These assemblies on each side were linked by a strong anti-roll bar.|$|E
50|$|Axles are an {{integral}} component of most practical wheeled vehicles. In a live-axle suspension system, the axles serve to transmit driving torque to the wheel, {{as well as to}} maintain the position of the wheels relative {{to each other and to}} the vehicle body. The axles in this system must also bear the weight of the vehicle plus any cargo. A non-driving axle, such as the <b>front</b> <b>beam</b> axle in heavy duty trucks and some two-wheel drive light trucks and vans, will have no shaft, and serves only as a suspension and steering component. Conversely, many front-wheel drive cars have a solid rear beam axle.|$|E

50|$|However, the livery {{that the}} UTA finally adopted saw the engines painted black with {{vermilion}} and yellow lining. Buffer beams, {{name and number}} plate backgrounds were red {{and the practice of}} putting the number on the <b>front</b> buffer <b>beam</b> was continued.|$|R

50|$|Proton {{has also}} fitted a new CVT gear lever with a side-mounted release switch and a {{headlight}} levelling dial {{which can be}} used to re-calibrate the <b>front</b> <b>beam</b> projection when the car is fully loaded. The driver's instrument cluster is largely unchanged over the Iriz, but it now features Proton's new ECO Drive Assist system, an indicator which lights up in green when the car is being driven in an economical manner. The speedometer and tachometer graphics are also new, and the central LCD screen is now lit in blue, compared to the Iriz's red. The instrument cluster housing is also finished in a glossy grey coat, as opposed to matte black in the Iriz.|$|E
50|$|The {{drawbacks}} {{are that}} it does not allow each wheel to move independently in response to bumps, and the mass of the beam is part of the unsprung weight of the vehicle, which can further reduce ride quality. Also the cornering ability is typically worse than other suspension designs because the wheels have zero camber angle gain during body roll. <b>Front</b> <b>beam</b> axle suspension is also unusually sensitive to any lack of concentricity in the hub and wheel assembly which can cause a side-to-side oscillation ("shimmy") of the steering at certain speeds (typically 40-50 mph). This is addressed on some vehicles with steering dampers although removal and careful refitting of the front wheels often cures the problem.|$|E
50|$|A typical Gravity racer cart {{is usually}} made of steel, and has 4 wheels, {{arranged}} as a fixed rear axle, and a steerable <b>front</b> <b>beam</b> axle - usually {{with a very}} simple single central pivot. A seat is arranged at the back, and perhaps the seat area is enclosed, as in the original soap-box design. More sophisticated designs might employ a fully enclosed body. The types of wheels employed vary according to what can be obtained easily - wheels from baby carriages, pushchairs, prams, and discarded bicycles being common. Ready-made wheels are also available from hardware suppliers. Steering is typically actuated using a rope connected {{to the ends of}} the steerable beam (which can then double as a useful manual pulling device).|$|E
