25|$|Bothriechis schlegelii, the <b>eyelash</b> <b>viper,</b> is a venomous pit viper species {{found in}} Central and South America. Small and arboreal, this species is {{characterized}} by a wide array of color variations, as well as the superciliary scales above the eyes. It is the most common of the green palm-pitvipers (genus Bothriechis), and is often present in zoological exhibits. The specific name schlegelii honors Hermann Schlegel, who was a German ornithologist and herpetologist. For other common names see below. No subspecies are currently recognized.|$|E
25|$|Tropical Discovery {{was opened}} in 1993. The {{building}} explores several tropical environments and displays mammals, reptiles, fish, amphibians and insects from these areas. The trip {{begins with a}} view into a South American river with different species of freshwater stingray then continues to a cave where guests are immersed within the community of several bat species including the vampire bat. A snake exhibit hidden inside a Mayan temple features several venomous species including the king cobra and <b>eyelash</b> <b>viper.</b> Other South American animals here include capybara, black howler monkey, arapaima, piranha and poison dart frog. Further on, visitors are immersed in a coral reef with epaulette sharks, clownfish, yellow tang, lionfish and garden eels. Around the corner, a gallery of North American snakes is located across from alligator snapping turtle and other North American reptiles and fish in a large pool. Further on, Siamese crocodile lurk in their pool amongst other swamp species like mata mata.

2500|$|The <b>eyelash</b> <b>viper</b> reaches sexual {{maturity}} at around {{two years of}} age, and the ovoviviparous species reproduces throughout the year in warm environments. Females carry eggs for around six months before they hatch internally, where the young complete their development.

2500|$|The <b>eyelash</b> <b>viper</b> is a {{relatively}} small species of pitviper, with adults ranging from [...] long, and females being longer and more variable in size than males, which can grow to [...] long. It has a wide, triangular-shaped head, and eyes with vertical pupils.

25|$|<b>Eyelash</b> <b>vipers</b> {{have not}} been {{evaluated}} by the IUCN Red List, and were removed from CITES Appendix III in 2002. While not listed as threatened, they are likely at risk of habitat loss from increased deforestation for timber, agriculture, and urbanization.|$|R
50|$|Eyelashes are an {{uncommon}} but not unknown feature in birds. Hornbills have prominent eyelashes (vestigial feathers with no barbs), as do ostriches. Amongst the reptiles, only <b>Eyelash</b> <b>vipers</b> show {{a set of}} modified scales over the eyes which look much like eyelashes.|$|R
50|$|In 1998, {{with the}} {{amalgamation}} of the Metro Municipalities, the Zoo was officially renamed the Toronto Zoo. That same year, the Zoo opened the Africa Savannah exhibits, the largest expansion in its history. In 2001, the zoo added <b>eyelash</b> <b>vipers</b> to its collection {{and opened the}} Gorilla Rainforest, the world’s largest indoor habitat for western lowland gorilla. The zoo's 'Splash Island', an educationally-themed water play area, opened in 2002. This was followed by an open-air amphitheatre in 2003 and the 'Kid's Zoo' in 2004 featuring exhibits geared to guests 10 and under.|$|R

5000|$|The area {{is home to}} {{thousands}} of plant and insect species as well as hundreds of species of amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. The list of animals include three monkey species (white-face capuchins, mantled howlers and spiders), pacas and aguotis, keel-billed toucans, white-crowned parrots, strawberry poison-dart frogs, <b>eyelash</b> <b>vipers</b> and green iguanas. The Research Station and surrounding forests and farm were purchased by the Molina family in 1987. Since it was established in 1993, La Suerte has attracted over 550 students from across the United States, Canada, Latin America, India and Japan to study tropical rainforest ecology and conservation.http://www.lasuerte.org/lasuerte.html ...|$|R
25|$|Some {{authorities}} {{also recognize}} a montane form that is treated {{either as a}} subspecies (B. s. supraciliaris) or as a species (B. supraciliaris).

5000|$|The Tropical Realm is {{also the}} centre of the reptile collection. The {{crocodile}} pools (which formerly housed West African dwarf crocodiles, American alligators and Philippine crocodiles) currently house spectacled caimans in one and white-winged wood ducks in the other. Near the entrance is an enclosure for tuataras. This lizard-like species from New Zealand is the last surviving sphenodont, a prehistoric group of reptiles, and Chester is the only British zoo to exhibit them. In February 2016, a tuatara hatched for the first time outside of New Zealand, leading Chester Zoo to be the only zoo to have bred them anywhere else. There were many varieties of snakes and lizards in the past (many had to depart as a result) rhinoceros ratsnakes, emerald tree boas and <b>eyelash</b> <b>vipers</b> now being the only remaining. The lizard collection is now made up of Serrated Casquehead Iguanas, Green-Crested Lizards, caiman lizards, and a Parson's chameleon.|$|R

50|$|Snake {{scales are}} of {{different}} shapes and sizes. Snake scales may be granular, have a smooth surface {{or have a}} longitudinal ridge or keel on it.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{comparative}} proteomic {{characterization of the}} venoms of two related neotropical arboreal pitvipers from Costa Rica of the genus Bothriechis, B. lateralis (side-striped palm pit viper) and B. schlegelii (<b>eyelash</b> pit <b>viper).</b> The crude venoms were fractionated by reverse-phase HPLC, followed by analysis of each chromatographic fraction by SDS-PAGE, N-terminal sequencing, MALDI-TOF mass fingerprinting, and collision-induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometry of tryptic peptides. The venom proteomes of B. lateralis and B. schlegelii comprise similar number of distinct proteins belonging, respectively, to 8 and 7 protein families. The two Bothriechis venoms contain bradykinin-potentiating peptides (BPPs), and proteins from the phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2), serine proteinase, l-amino acid oxidase (LAO), cysteine-rich secretory protein (CRISP), and Zn 2 +-dependent metalloproteinase (SVMP) families, albeit each species exhibit different relative abundances. Each venom also contains unique components, for example, snake venom vascular endothelial growth factor (svVEGF) and C-type lectin-like molecules in B. lateralis, and Kazal-type serine proteinase inhibitor-like proteins in B. schlegelii. Using a similarity coefficient, we estimate that the similarity of the venom proteins between the two Bothriechis taxa may be < 10 %, indicating a high divergence in their venom compositions, {{in spite of the}} fact that both species have evolved to adapt to arboreal habits. The major toxin families of B. lateralis and B. schlegelii are SVMP (55 % of the total venom proteins) and PLA 2 (44 %), respectively. Their different venom toxin compositions provide clues for rationalizing the distinct signs of envenomation caused by B. schlegelii and B. lateralis. An antivenomic study of the immunoreactivity of the Instituto Clodomiro Picado (ICP) polyvalent antivenom toward Bothriechis venoms revealed that l-amino acid oxidase and SVMPs represent the major antigenic protein species in both venoms. Our results provide a ground for rationalizing the reported protection of the ICP polyvalent antivenom against the hemorrhagic, coagulant, defibrinating, caseinolytic and fibrin(ogen) olytic activities of Bothriechis (schlegelii, lateralis) venoms. However, these analyses also evidenced the limited recognition capability of the polyvalent antivenom toward a number of Bothriechis venom components, predominantly BPPs, svVEGF, Kazal-type inhibitors, some PLA 2 proteins, some serine proteinases, and CRISP molecules. info:eu-repo//Ministerio de Educación y Ciencia// BFU 2004 - 01432 /BMC/ [Madrid, España]//info:eu-repo//Universidad de Costa Rica-CSIC// 2006 CR 0010 /[Costa Rica]//info:eu-repo//Ciencia y tecnología para el Desarrollo (CYTED) // 206 AC 0281 /[España]//UCR::Investigación::Unidades de Investigación::Ciencias de la Salud::Instituto Clodomiro Picado (ICP...|$|R
