40|$|This short paper {{introduces}} {{the papers and}} commentary produced at two significant First Amendment occasions.

The paper traces events leading up to the decision, the impact of the decision and its resonance to modern times in inspiring rulings such as the Citizens United decision. This paper also {{introduces the}} larger Free Speech Symposium which explored not only campaign finance issues as a central First Amendment matter, but more broadly considered the role of Free Speech in our constitutional system, the surprisingly speech protective rulings of the Roberts Court on those issues and some powerful critiques of those decisions. Featuring leading First Amendment activists and scholars with views across the spectrum, the Symposium thoroughly canvassed the past, present and future of free speech...|$|R
50|$|After their failed operation, Penny loses {{contact with}} the resistance.

In March, however, the German invasion of the Soviet Union breathes new life into the resistance as Communists now join the effort. Penny is contacted once again by Coral Kennedy, a young woman whom he met during the failed effort to smuggle out the Regent and the jewels.

Yet these are isolated successes amidst a series of setbacks, as the Germans disrupt operations and shut down networks. Glass himself soon leaves Britain to serve on the Eastern Front; his departure coincides with the roundup of foreign-born Jews by the authorities, including one in hiding on Cordington's estate.
