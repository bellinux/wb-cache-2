5|$|Saratoga {{received}} a RCA CXAM-1 <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>radar</b> in February 1941 during a refit in Bremerton. The antenna was {{mounted on the}} forward lip of the funnel with its control room directly below the aerial, replacing the secondary conning station formerly mounted there. She also received two FC (Mk 3) surface fire-control radars in late 1941, although these were both removed along with her main armament in January 1942. The new dual-purpose guns were controlled by two Mk 37 directors, each mounting an FD (Mk 4) anti-aircraft gunnery radar. When the 1.1-inch guns were replaced by 40mm guns in 1942, the directors for the smaller guns were replaced by five Mk 51 directors. A small SC-1 <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>radar</b> was mounted on the rear lip of the funnel during 1942. A SG surface-search radar was mounted on the foremast at the same time.|$|E
5|$|While in drydock in July 1943, a Type 21 air {{search radar}} was {{installed}} {{on the roof of}} the 10-meter rangefinder at the top of the pagoda mast. In August 1944, two Type 22 surface search radar units were {{installed on the}} pagoda mast and two Type 13 <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>radar</b> units were fitted on her mainmast.|$|E
5|$|Parallel {{with the}} {{implementation}} of the Dnestr space surveillance units, {{a modified version of the}} original Dnestr units, Dnestr-M radar, was being developed to act as an <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>radar</b> to identify attacks by ballistic missiles. The first two were built at Murmansk in northern Russia (Olenegorsk – RO-1) and near Riga in the then Latvian SSR (Skrunda – RO-2). They constituted the beginning of the Soviet SPRN network, the equivalent of the NATO BMEWS.|$|E
500|$|Dnestr radar (...) and Dnepr radar (...) , both {{known by}} the NATO {{reporting}} name Hen House are {{the first generation of}} Soviet space surveillance and <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>radars.</b> Six radars of this type were built around the periphery of the Soviet Union starting in the 1960s to provide ballistic missile warnings for attacks from different directions. They were the primary Soviet <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>radars</b> for much of the later Cold War. In common with other Soviet and Russian <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>radars</b> they are named after rivers, the Dnestr and the Dnepr.|$|R

5|$|The {{nature of}} the gradual {{escalation}} had given Hanoi time {{to adapt to the}} situation. By 1967, North Vietnam had formed an estimated 25 SAM battalions (with six missile launchers each) which rotated among approximately 150 sites. With the assistance of the Soviet Union, the North Vietnamese had also quickly integrated an <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>radar</b> system of more than 200 facilities which covered the entire country, tracking incoming U.S. raids, and then coordinating SAMs, anti-aircraft batteries, and MiGs to attack them. During 1967 U.S. losses totaled 248 aircraft (145 Air Force, 102 Navy, and one Marine Corps).|$|E

5|$|The VPAF High Command {{immediately}} scrambled two {{flights of}} four MiG-17 fighters from the VPAF 923rd Fighter Regiment, {{followed by two}} MiG-21 fighters from the VPAF 921st Fighter Regiment at 2:51pm. The MiG-21 force was led by Nguyen Nhat Chieu with Nguyen Van Coc, {{who had participated in}} the VPAF's disastrous mission during Operation Bolo, as the wingman. The first and second MiG-17 flights were commanded by Cao Thanh Tinh and Nguyen Van Tho respectively. Once airborne, North Vietnamese pilots maneuvered their aircraft into positions to deploy their new tactic which required the MiG-17 fighters to act as bait, while the MiG-21 fighters attacked from the rear. After Chieu and Coc had departed from Phuc Yen Air Base, they flew at low level and stayed in the ground clutter to avoid detection by airborne radars employed by U.S aircraft. However, the MiG-21’s transponders were detected by an orbiting EC-121 airborne <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>radar</b> surveillance aircraft, and their positions were relayed to the F-4 fighters that were escorting the strike formation, but they did not respond.|$|E

In August 2004, the Danish and Greenland Home Rule governments gave permission for the <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>radar</b> to be updated {{in connection with a}} role in the U.S. ballistic missile defense system. At the same time, agreements were signed to enhance economic, technical, and environmental cooperation between the United States and Greenland.|$|E
50|$|Originally IFF {{was only}} {{considered}} to be of use with Flak hence the limitation above. As the war progressed it was realised that IFF should also work with <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>radars</b> hence {{a new version of}} the FuG 25 was developed.|$|R
5000|$|Olenegorsk was {{the site}} of one of the first two <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>radars</b> in the Soviet Union, the other being at Skrunda-1. The Dnestr-M radar (NATO codename: [...] "Hen House") was started in 1963 and {{completed}} in 1969, entering service in 1971.|$|R
50|$|The 821st Main Space Surveillance Centre is {{the centre}} of Russia's space {{surveillance}} network. It is located near Noginsk outside Moscow.

5|$|An August 1944 study {{anticipated}} that the ships would carry four <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>radars,</b> including height-finders, four surface search radars and eight gunnery/fire-control radars. Historian David Hobbs wrote that they would mount Type 960 <b>early</b> <b>warning,</b> Type 982 intercept, Type 983 height-finding and Type 293M target indication radars. In addition a number of gunnery radars would also be needed.|$|R
50|$|HQ-81 (红旗 HQ = Hong Qi, meaning Red Flag) is the ABMS of Project 640-1, {{consisting}} of Type 715 engagement radars, FJ series missiles and other fire control systems (but {{not including the}} <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>radars).</b> During deployment, HQ-81 system would be operating with information received from satellite and radars.|$|R
25|$|A {{battery of}} six Tunguska can {{automatically}} receive fire control information via an encrypted radio link, this allows targets {{to be distributed}} between individual units from a Ranzhir or PPRU battery command post, which can receive target information from either AWACS or <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>radar</b> {{or in the case}} of the PPRU its own radar equipment.|$|E
25|$|The 1972 Anti-ballistic missile treaty {{requires}} that <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>radar</b> stations {{are located on}} the periphery of national territory and face outwards. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 this resulted in many of the stations ending up in newly independent states. The radar station at Skrunda, now in Latvia, closed in 1998. Other stations now overseas were Sevastopol and Mukachevo (both in Ukraine), Balkhash (Kazakhstan) and Gabala (Azerbaijan).|$|E
25|$|The Cold War {{expansion}} of the base in the early 1950s coincided with the Korean War and the rise in nuclear tensions with the Soviet Union. The USAF sought to build more roads {{in the area to}} serve the base and nearby Pinetree Line <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>radar</b> site and to patrol the immediate area for security; the roads would also act as a means of dispersing personnel in an emergency. One of the more important projects was a bypass road around the base, known as the Hansen Memorial Highway.|$|E
50|$|The 36th Bomb Squadron flew {{specially}} equipped B-17s and B-24s to jam enemy <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>radars</b> and telecommunications, screen {{assembly and}} inbound flights of allied bombers, and spoof the enemy {{into thinking that}} other bomber formations (nonexistent) were assembling. This early form of electronic warfare was very successful in disrupting German forces.|$|R
5|$|While in drydock in May 1943, a Type 21 air {{search radar}} was {{installed}} {{on the roof of}} the 10-meter rangefinder at the top of the pagoda mast.

5000|$|... "Blip" [...] {{refers to}} the dots drawn on <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>radars</b> based on plan {{position}} indicator (PPI) displays. A [...] "scan" [...] is a single search of the entire sky made by the rotating antenna. A radar with a low blip-to-scan ratio draws only a few reflections from an object (mainly aircraft), {{making it more difficult}} to detect.|$|R
25|$|In 1954 {{the first}} Air Radar Recruit School was activated, the first <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>radar</b> systems were {{installed}} {{and the concept}} of command & control facilities at mountain summits was introduced; leading to acquisition of the FLORIDA early warning and command guidance system in 1965 followed by the current FLORAKO system in 2003. At the same time, ground-based air defence projects were initiated such as radar-equipped medium-caliber guns with an integrated 63 Superfledermaus (Superbat) fire control system' as well as the BL-64 ‘Bloodhound’ air defence missile system (1964–1999).|$|E
25|$|According to some reports, the Komsomolsk-na-Amure {{installation}} in the Russian Far East {{was taken}} off combat alert duty in November 1989, {{and some of its}} equipment was subsequently scrapped. The original Duga-1 site lies within the 30 kilometer Zone of Alienation around the Chernobyl power plant. It appears to have been permanently deactivated, since their continued maintenance did not figure in the negotiations between Russia and Ukraine over the active Dnepr <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>radar</b> systems at Mukachevo and Sevastopol. The antenna still stands, however, and has been used by amateurs as a transmission tower (using their own antennas) and has been extensively photographed.|$|E
25|$|Before {{operations}} against the Egyptian positions could begin, the IDF sought to disable the <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>radar</b> and ELINT facilities on Green Island, a heavily fortified island {{located near the}} southern extremity of the Canal. Deemed a possible threat to Israeli aircraft operating in the region, the island was attacked by Israeli special forces on July 19 as part of Operation Bulmus 6, destroying its anti-aircraft defences and early-warning radar. Israeli Air Force 115 Squadron A-4 Skyhawks struck the island before the attack commenced, while a pair of 124 Squadron Bell 205s participated in the extraction of Israeli troops after their departure.|$|E
5000|$|The Aerospace Defence Forces had {{locations}} across Russia and {{bases in}} some Commonwealth of Independent States {{countries such as}} <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>radars</b> in Azerbaijan (until December 2012), Kazakhstan and Belarus, and the Okno facility in Tajikistan.

25|$|Currently {{the only}} active foreign {{military}} installation on Israeli soil is the American AN/TPY-2 <b>early</b> missile <b>warning</b> <b>radar</b> station on Mt. Keren.|$|R
50|$|And {{thus the}} concept of using the blip/scan to avoid detection. A high-speed, high-altitude {{aircraft}} might fly over <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>radars</b> without being recognized. Moreover, even if an operator recognized the blip as an aircraft, {{the small number of}} returns and fast movement across the display would make it difficult or impossible to manually calculate a trajectory for relay to intercepting aircraft.|$|R
