Bates's involvement in the plot began when he became suspicious of Catesby's movements. [...] In December 1604 he was invited to his master's lodgings at Puddle Wharf in London, and questioned there by Thomas Wintour and Catesby, who had noted his suspicion. [...] Bates told them that he thought that they [...] "intended some <b>dangerous</b> <b>matter</b> about the Parliament House, because he had been sent to get a lodging near unto that place." [...] At that point the two men let Bates in on the secret.|$|E

The accident frequency {{is one of the key}} elements influencing transport reliability. For that reason it is necessary to analyse the places of accident occurrence for minimizing accident frequency. It is possible to identify critical places on the road infrastructure of the Czech Republic with using the analysis of accident frequency. All of these factors will improve safety by this risk type of transport of matters. The safety of road transport of <b>dangerous</b> <b>matters</b> is influenced not only by characteristics of a utilized vehicle and by personality characteristics and knowledge of a driver, but also by a selected transport route...|$|R

40|$|Recently, many <b>dangerous</b> <b>matters</b> {{such as a}} {{kidnapping}} and a natural disaster befall school-age children. Of course, their parents and the surrounding people will watch over or shield from danger or harm. Mobile cooperation has also developed the Kid’s Mobile Phone as the monitoring system with mobile phone. However, the monitoring function is slightly strong, so that the spontaneous action for child was blocked off. It seems to avoid nurturing his/her talents. During school age, they can learn ‘bushcraft’ through experiences in any natural environment. The new support function for child to rearing spontaneous action is required. In this paper, we developed the Android smartphone based Participatory Sensing System which can determine the child’s active space according to dynamic ever‐changing environment and measure the degree of danger. The system can inform the risk situation {{not only to the}} child with the smartphone but to the parent by an email...|$|R

The first one is pointed to importance of effective legislation in the Czech Republic and the European Union, which is dedicated to shipping the dangerous articles by road transport. Also it regards to risks of accidents and possible ecologic impacts to an environment. This part compares the amount of traffic accidents in the Czech Republic and states of the EU in a frame of ADR. It shows the risks related to shipping the dangerous articles by road transport. The closing part belongs to important elements of safe transportation of <b>dangerous</b> <b>matters.</b> The second part of the thesis analyses current state of shipping information systems in the Czech Republic and in the European Union. There is the analysis, the suggestions for improvement of the systems´ efficiency and its application in the Czech Republic.

He had always determined, deep down in his resolute heart, that nothing would ever induce him to allow his daughter to wed a Mormon. Such a marriage he regarded as no marriage at all, but as a shame and a disgrace. Whatever he might think of the Mormon doctrines, upon that one point he was inflexible. He had to seal his mouth on the subject, however, for to express an unorthodox opinion was a <b>dangerous</b> <b>matter</b> in those days in the Land of the Saints.|$|E

60|$|Communication between Jackman's Gulch and {{the outside}} world was {{difficult}} and uncertain. A portion of the bush between it and Ballarat was infested by a redoubtable outlaw named Conky Jim, who, with a small band as desperate as himself, made travelling a <b>dangerous</b> <b>matter.</b> It was customary, therefore, at the Gulch, to store up the dust and nuggets obtained from the mines in a special store, each man's share being placed in a separate bag on which his name was marked. A trusty man, named Woburn, was deputed to watch over this primitive bank. When the amount deposited became considerable, a waggon was hired, and the whole treasure was conveyed to Ballarat, guarded {{by the police and}} by a certain number of miners, who took it in turn to perform the office. Once in Ballarat, it was forwarded on to Melbourne by the regular gold waggons. By this plan the gold was often kept for months in the Gulch before being despatched, but Conky Jim was effectually checkmated, as the escort party were far too strong for him and his gang. He appeared, at the time of which I write, to have forsaken his haunts in disgust, and the road could be traversed by small parties with impunity.|$|E

60|$|I {{wanted to}} impress her with some great and awful {{instance}} of my power, {{and to this}} end had determined to confer a great benefit upon my honest cousin Ulick, and carry off for him the fair object of his affections, Miss Kiljoy, under the very eyes of her guardian and friend, Lady Lyndon; and {{in the teeth of}} the squires, the young lady's brothers, who passed the season at Dublin, and made as much swagger and to-do about their sister's L10,000 Irish, as if she had had a plum to her fortune. The girl was by no means averse to Mr. Brady; and it only shows how faint-spirited some men are, and how a superior genius can instantly overcome difficulties which to common minds seem insuperable, that he never had thought of running off with her: as I at once and boldly did. Miss Kiljoy had been a ward in Chancery until she attained her majority (before which period {{it would have been a}} <b>dangerous</b> <b>matter</b> for me to put in execution the scheme I meditated concerning her); but, though now free to marry whom she liked, she was a young lady of timid disposition, and as much under fear of her brothers and relatives as though she had not been independent of them. They had some friend of their own in view for the young lady, and had scornfully rejected the proposal of Ulick Brady, the ruined gentleman; who was quite unworthy, as these rustic bucks thought, of the hand of such a prodigiously wealthy heiress as their sister.|$|E
6000|$|Men {{knew how}} to be as wrong-headed and as graceless as women. We have already {{mentioned}} the name of Landois in connection with Diderot's article on Liberty. Landois {{seems to have been}} a marvel of unreasonableness, but he was a needy man of letters, and that was enough to make Diderot ready to bear with him and to succour him. He wound up an epistle abounding, after the manner of the worthless failures of the world, in reproaches and grievances against his benefactor, with a cool request about a manuscript that was full of <b>dangerous</b> <b>matter.</b> [...] "Why, that," [...] replied Diderot, [...] "is a work that might well be the ruin of me! And it is after you have on two separate occasions charged me with the most atrocious and deliberate offences towards you, that you now propose that I should revise and print your work! You know that I have a wife and child, that I am a marked man, that you are putting me into the class of hardened offenders; never mind, you don't think of one of these things. You take me for an imbecile, or else you are one. But you are no imbecile.... I see through men's designs, and often enough I lend myself to them, without deigning to disabuse them as to the stupidity which they impute to me. It is enough if I perceive in their design some great service for them, and not an excess of inconvenience for myself. It is not I who am the fool, so often as people take me for one." [...] Diderot then seems half to forget to whom he is writing and pours out what reads like a long soliloquy on morals, conduct, and the philosophy of life. He insists that man, with all his high-flying freedom of will, is but a little link in a great chain of events. He is a creature to be modified from without; hence the good effects of example, discourse, education, pleasures, pains, greatness, misery. Hence a sort of philosophy of commiseration, which attaches us strongly to the good, and irritates us no more against the bad than against a wind-storm that fills our eyes with dust. If you adopt such principles as these, they will reconcile you with others and yourself; you will neither praise nor blame yourself for what you are. To reproach others with nothing, to repent yourself of nothing--these are the two first steps towards wisdom; this is the philosophy that reconciles us with the human race and with life.[228] ...|$|E

In addition, new insights on the complex molecular inter-relationships arising from 'omics' are examined, in light of the information they can provide on specific intracellular events elicited by nanomaterials. Finally, we describe the mechanism of action of fibre-like nanomaterials. © 2014 Woodhead Publishing Limited. All rights reserved...|$|R
