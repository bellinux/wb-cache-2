5|$|There are two {{categories}} of kicks in football: scrimmage kicks, which can be executed by the offensive team on any down from behind or on the line of scrimmage, and free <b>kicks.</b> <b>The</b> free kicks are the kickoff, which starts {{the first and third}} quarters and overtime and follows a try attempt or a successful field goal, and the safety kick, which follows a safety.|$|E
5|$|A soccer kick is {{performed}} when a fighter is standing {{to the side}} or {{in front of an}} opponent on the ground and <b>kicks</b> <b>the</b> grounded opponent's head. This is done in a style similar to an association football player kicking a football. Most practitioners aim to use their shins for the point of impact rather than the foot. While soccer kicks are usually delivered to the head, kicks {{to other parts of the}} body in a similar style are also referred to as soccer kicks.|$|E

5|$|At the FBI safe house, {{a police}} car arrives with Modell. Modell enters the room that Linda is in and locks the door behind him. Mulder tells Scully {{the news of the}} therapist's death and urges her to keep Linda away from a phone. At the safe house, Skinner finds Linda's room door locked. He <b>kicks</b> <b>the</b> door down to find Modell and Linda, with Modell calmly saying that he has a gun. Without hesitation, Skinner shoots Modell when he sees a gun in Modell's hand, but once he is on the ground Skinner sees that his hand is curled into the shape of the gun.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, at the Dunder Mifflin office, Charles Miner (Idris Elba) is {{revealed}} {{to have an}} obsession with soccer, {{and the rest of}} the employees pretend to feel the same way about it. When Jim (John Krasinski) tries claiming to be an experienced soccer player, Dwight (Rainn Wilson), attempting to humiliate Jim, suggests that the staff play a game after work in the parking lot. During the game, when Charles <b>kicks</b> <b>the</b> ball towards Jim, he ducks and the ball hits Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) in the face. Charles berates Jim for ducking, and Dwight mocks him.|$|E
5|$|After {{designing}} {{their own}} pro skateboard, the protagonist and Eric {{embark on a}} team trip to Moscow, Russia, where they reconcile. However, Eric gets drunk and joyrides in a Russian military tank. The protagonist hops in and attempts to stop the tank, but being unfamiliar with the controls, fails to stop it from crashing. Eric jumps out and runs away, leaving the protagonist, trapped inside, to be arrested by the Russian military. Eric then lies and claims the protagonist stole the tank, stating that he in fact tried to stop them. Unwilling to pay the $700,000 worth of damages, Todd <b>kicks</b> <b>the</b> protagonist off the team, much to Eric's delight. The American Embassy bails out the protagonist, leaving them to do favors for locals in order to return home to New Jersey.|$|E

5|$|Canadian football, the {{predominant}} form of football in Canada, {{is closely related}} to American football – both sports developed from rugby, and the two sports are considered to be the chief variants of gridiron football. Although the two games share a similar set of rules, there are several key rule differences: for example, in Canadian football the field measures , including two 20-yard end zones (for a distance between goal lines of 110 yards), teams have three downs instead of four, there are twelve players on each side instead of eleven, fair catches are not allowed, and a rouge, worth a single point is scored if the offensive team <b>kicks</b> <b>the</b> ball out of the defense's end zone. The Canadian Football League (CFL) is the major Canadian league and is the second-most popular sporting league in Canada, behind only the National Hockey League.|$|E
5|$|In December 2010, the Western New York Flash, {{previously}} {{part of the}} W-League, {{joined the}} WPS for the 2011 season. Shortly after, Engen signed with the team. She played in 17 of the team's 18 regular season games to help the Flash finish first {{in the regular season}} and advance to the playoffs. Engen appeared in the 2011 WPS Championship on August 27, 2011 against the Philadelphia Independence. The game was tied 1–1 after regulation and extra time, leaving the outcome of the match to be decided by penalty <b>kicks.</b> <b>The</b> Flash won the championship after goalkeeper Ashlyn Harris blocked the shot by Philadelphia's Laura del Rio. Following the 2011 season, Engen was named WPS Defender of the Year and to the 2011 WPS Top XI.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} segment, Mr. Burns fires Homer for his laziness and incompetence. Looking for work, Homer answers a {{classified}} ad {{to become a}} grave digger. Meanwhile, Mr. Burns is nearing the completion of his giant robotic laborer, which he hopes will eventually replace weak-bodied human workers. The only remaining step is to implant a human brain into the machine's body. Searching a graveyard the following night, Mr. Burns mistakes Homer, snoring in an open grave, for a newly buried corpse and, despite signs that Homer may still be alive, removes Homer's brain with an ice cream scoop and places it in the robot. However, Robo-Homer is just as lazy and incompetent as he was as a human, using his X-ray vision to locate donuts. Mr. Burns declares the experiment a failure and, after restoring the brain to Homer's still-living body, <b>kicks</b> <b>the</b> robot, which topples over and crushes Mr. Burns. Afterward, he tells Smithers to get some surgical tools and ether.|$|E

5|$|Later, Charlie finds Liam high on heroin with groupies. Charlie <b>kicks</b> <b>the</b> groupies out, {{and tells}} Liam that he's {{done with the}} band. Liam says to Charlie that he, Liam, is Drive Shaft, and that nobody knows who the bass player (Charlie) is. He goes on to tell Charlie that without the band, Charlie is nothing, which spurs Charlie to use heroin for the first time. Years later, Charlie visits Liam's house in Australia and wants Liam to rejoin Drive Shaft for a {{comeback}} tour. Liam declines, but the band can't do the tour without him. He criticizes Charlie for still using drugs, and Charlie blames Liam for getting him started with drugs. Liam asks Charlie {{to stay with him}} for a few weeks, saying that Sydney has some good rehab programs and that he can get Charlie help. Charlie angrily leaves, saying he has a plane to catch.|$|E
5|$|On a kickoff, {{the ball}} is placed at the 35-yard line of the kicking team in {{professional}} and college play and at the 40-yard line in high school play. The ball may be drop-kicked or place-kicked. If a place kick is chosen, the ball can {{be placed on the}} ground or on a tee, and a holder may be used in either case. On a safety kick, the kicking team <b>kicks</b> <b>the</b> ball from their own 20-yard line. They can punt, drop-kick or place-kick the ball, but a tee may not be used in professional play. Any member of the receiving team may catch or advance the ball, and the ball may be recovered by the kicking team once it has gone at least ten yards and has touched the ground or has been touched by any member of the receiving team.|$|E
5|$|Type Ia supernovae, {{that involve}} helium {{accretion}} {{by a white}} dwarf, have been proposed to be a channel for transformation {{of this type of}} stellar remnant. In this scenario, the carbon detonation produced in a Type Ia supernova is too weak to destroy the white dwarf, expelling just a small part of its mass as ejecta, but produces an asymmetric explosion that <b>kicks</b> <b>the</b> star, often known as a zombie star, to high speeds of a hypervelocity star. The matter processed in the failed detonation is re-accreted by the white dwarf with the heaviest elements such as iron falling to its core where it accumulates. These iron-core white dwarfs would be smaller than the carbon-oxygen kind of similar mass and would cool and crystallize faster than those.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} the difference in technique required to execute <b>the</b> Dipping Free <b>Kick</b> in soccer from <b>the</b> Instep <b>Kick.</b> Subjects were six experienced soccer players ranging from college varsity to third division professional levels. Each subject performed three successful free kicks and three maximal velocity instep kicks.

25|$|The ball can {{be kicked}} in any {{direction}} and is used as an attacking option or to gain territory. There are three types of kicks used; the punt, drop kick and place kick. To punt the ball the player must kick the ball before it touches the ground. A drop kick occurs if the ball first bounces on the ground before being kicked. With a place kick the ball must {{be placed on the}} ground (usually on a kicking tee or in sand) before being kicked. Slight variations that commonly occur are taps, when a player <b>kicks</b> <b>the</b> ball a very short distance and regathers it, and toe-throughs, when a player <b>kicks</b> <b>the</b> ball along the ground instead of diving on it or picking it up.|$|E
