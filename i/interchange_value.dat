40|$|Management of Collaborative Networked Organizations faces various {{challenges}} {{in terms of}} decision-making. Particularly, in complex and multi-player environments, like healthcare, {{it is not easy}} to find the roots of low performance processes, and unmet goals. This research provides a framework, as well as associated techniques to analyze the value network, identify problematic actors, and consequently, find the best possible solution to change them. The proposed framework consists of two main components: Analyzing the value network, and Multi-Criteria Decision Making. To analyze the value network of a collaborative environment, in addition to the existing techniques, four complementary components are introduced: Actors’ <b>value</b> <b>interchanges</b> matrix, <b>Value</b> Gantt chart, Identifying problematic actors flowchart, and Actors’ ease of substitution table. Employing these hybrid analyses, decision makers gain a better understanding of the bottlenecks in the value network, current conditions and contributions of the involved actors, and the consequences of considering various alternatives. Then, by applying one of the Multi-Criteria Decision Making methods, and based on pre-defined criteria, possible alternatives are analyzed and outlined. As a proof of concept and validation of the proposed methods, we reviewed a scenario of patient flow and wait times in healthcare. We derive the value network for collaborative processes in a hospital, specify the roles’ of actors, identify the bottlenecks, then rank the solutions, and suggest possible changes to improve the performance of the collaborative environment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Data {{perturbation}} is {{a method}} of reference control in statistical database. Data modification and data swapping are two methods of data perturbation. Data modification replaces the original data with the sample data sequence after deciding probability distribution function of the original data and generating sample data sequence. Data swapping <b>interchanges</b> attribute <b>values</b> of records. While the algorithm of the former is complex, this paper presents a new method in which the sample sequence generation is skipped. We simply sort the original data, divide them into different groups and exchange attribute values of the same group. Experiment show that the proposed method can effectively simplify the former method and guarantee {{the safety of the}} statistical data at the same time...|$|R

40|$|The π-tangle is used {{to study}} the {{behavior}} of entanglement of a nonmaximal tripartite state of both Dirac and scalar fields in accelerated frame. For Dirac fields, the degree of degradation with acceleration of both one-tangle of accelerated observer and π-tangle, for the same initial entanglement, is different by just <b>interchanging</b> the <b>values</b> of probability amplitudes. A fraction of both one-tangles and the π-tangle always survives for any choice of acceleration {{and the degree of}} initial entanglement. For scalar field, the one-tangle of accelerated observer depends on the choice of values of probability amplitudes and it vanishes in the range of infinite acceleration, whereas for π-tangle this is not always true. The dependence of π-tangle on probability amplitudes varies with acceleration. In the lower range of acceleration, its behavior changes by switching between the values of probability amplitudes and for larger values of acceleration this dependence on probability amplitudes vanishes. Interestingly, unlike bipartite entanglement, the degradation of π-tangle against acceleration in the case of scalar fields is slower than for Dirac fields. Comment: Four Figures in color...|$|R

50|$|Copper {{units of}} {{pressure}} or CUP, {{and the related}} lead units of pressure or LUP, are terms applied to pressure measurements used {{in the field of}} internal ballistics for the estimation of chamber pressures in firearms. These terms were adopted by convention to indicate that the pressure values were measured by copper crusher and lead crusher gauges respectively. In recent years, they have been replaced by the adoption of more modern piezoelectric pressure gauges that more accurately measure chamber pressures and generally give significantly higher pressure values. This nomenclature was adopted to avoid confusion and the potentially dangerous <b>interchange</b> of pressure <b>values</b> and standards made by different types of pressure gauges. Pressure is a fundamental thermodynamic parameter that is expressed in units of force divided by area. In the avoirdupois system, the units of pressure are pounds per square inch and in the metric system, the units or pressure are newtons per square meter (pascals). A chamber pressure measured with a copper crusher gauge would be expressed as psi (CUP) in the English system or MPa (CUP) in the metric system.|$|R

40|$|Increasingly, large retail {{companies}} {{are finding that}} the traditional vision of Electronic Data <b>Interchange</b> using a <b>Value</b> Added Network with expensive message translation software and private wide area networks, is unable to deliver its promise of paperless trading with their suppliers. While many have achieved {{a high level of}} EDI compliance from large suppliers, many unsophisticated, usually small, suppliers remain outside their electronic commerce network creating a barrier to achieving the most important business re-engineering benefits which require 100 % compliance. Many large retailers are turning to the diverse range of Internet-based document distribution and presentation systems which have recently appeared to provide new ways of including unsophisticated traders in their replenishment systems. In this paper we argue that the traditional EDI vision emerged through the interaction of a number of aspects of the replenishment problem context, namely available technology, transaction cost structure, the power of message transmission intermediaries, notions about how to achieve supply chain cooperation, and the shared understandings of correct electronic commerce practice within the industry. The traditional EDI vision achieved only partial supply chain compliance because it failed to tak...|$|R
40|$|We study a plant {{population}} model introduced recently by J. Wallinga [OIKOS 74, 377 (1995) ]. It {{is similar to}} the contact process (`simple epidemic', `directed percolation'), but instead of using an infection or recovery rate as control parameter, the population size is controlled directly and globally by removing excess plants. We show that the model is very closely related to directed percolation (DP). Anomalous scaling laws appear in the limit of large populations, small densities, and long times. These laws, associated critical exponents, and even some non-universal parameters, can be related to those of DP. As in invasion percolation and in other models where the rôles of control and order parameters are <b>interchanged,</b> the critical <b>value</b> p_c of the wetting probability p is obtained in the scaling limit as singular point in the distribution of infection rates. We show that a mean field type approximation leads to a model studied by Y. C. Zhang et al. [J. Stat. Phys. 58, 849 (1990) ]. Finally, we verify the claim of Wallinga that family extinction in a marginally surviving population is governed by DP scaling laws, and speculate on applications to human mitochondrial DNA.

40|$|As the nation's {{population}} {{continues to}} grow, the users of highway network face increased safety risks, delays and congestion. Budget constraints at many public agencies frequently make infeasible {{the construction of}} new facilities to improve the safety and capacity of the highway network. This thesis addresses two issues pertaining to roadway safety and capacity: maintenance of traffic for innovative geometric design work zones and calibrating highway safety manual for Missouri interchanges. In an effort to improve the safety and capacity of existing roads, many transportation practitioners are implementing innovative designs at intersections and interchanges. The development of construction phasing plans for these projects is a critical component to maintaining safety and mobility on the facility during construction. The goal of this research is to present the state of the practice and providing guidance for transportation practitioners in developing construction phasing and maintenance of traffic (MOT) plans for projects with innovative geometric designs. Several types of innovative geometric designs were studied including the roundabout, single point urban interchange (SPUI), diverging diamond interchange (DDI), restricted-crossing left turn (RCUT), median U-turn (MUT), and displaced left turn (DLT). Example MOT phasing diagrams showing phasing sequencing and construction work areas were developed based on a review of literature, survey of practitioners, interviews with industry experts, and review of actual project plans. The example MOT phasing diagrams are intended to serve {{as a starting point for}} transportation practitioners, but project-specific factors such as driver experience, availability of detours, traffic counts, adjacent land use, elevation differences, barrier offsets, number of lanes, and anticipated impacts of a possible closure should be considered when deciding on the best MOT methods for a given project. The second issue relates to the safety analysis of Missouri interchanges using AASHTO's Highway Safety Manual (HSM), a nationally accepted manual. In a 2014 supplement, freeway facilities were added to the original manual to allow for the modeling of highway interchanges. This research documents the calibration of the most vital freeway interchange facility types in Missouri. These facility types include nine freeway interchange terminals, including diamond, partial cloverleaf, and full cloverleaf interchanges. The nonterminal facilities included entrance and exit speed-change lanes, and entrance and exit ramps. The calibrated facilities applied to both rural and urban locations. For each facility type, sample sites were randomly selected from an exhaustive master list. Four types of data were collected for each site: geometric, AADT, traffic control, and crash. Crash data was especially noteworthy because of a crash georeferencing problem, i. e. crashes were not located on the proper interchange facility. A significant crash correction project was undertaken involving the review of 11, 768 crash reports, and the detailed review of 9, 168 crash reports. Using the corrected data, 44 calibration values were derived for freeway terminal and non-terminal facilities. These values are the first reported freeway <b>interchange</b> calibration <b>values</b> since the release of the 2014 HSM supplement...|$|R
