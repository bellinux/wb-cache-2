5|$|How can I without {{deviating}} {{from my own}} principles undertake {{an additional}} duty of a kind <b>for</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> am conscious I am growing every day more unfit, as your Majesty must know what an uncommon stock of spirits and cheerfulness is necessary {{to go through the}} growing attendance of so many and such very young people in their amusements, as well as behaviour and instruction, besides ordering all the affairs of the nursery.|$|E
25|$|I find it {{very hard}} to say this truth. I am to blame for {{everything}} I did at that time. I am trying to erase all this and to be what I was not at that time. I am also to blame for what I did not do, for not trying to protect those prisoners. Regardless of the temporary nature of my then-post. I ask myself again and again, what could I have done that I didn't do? Thousands of innocent victims perished. Graves remain behind, refugees, destruction and misfortune and misery. I bear general part of the responsibility for this. There is misfortune on all sides that stays behind as a warning that this should never happen again. My testimony and admission of guilt will also remove blame from my nation because it is individual guilt, the guilt of a man named Dragan Obrenović. I stand by this. I am responsible for this. The guilt <b>for</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> feel remorse and <b>for</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> apologise to the victims and to their shadows. I will be happy if this contributed to reconciliation in Bosnia, if neighbours can again shake hands, if our children can again play games together, and if {{they have the right to}} a chance. I will be happy if my testimony helps the families of victims, if I can spare them having to testify again and thus relive the horrors and the pain during their testimony. It is my wish that my testimony should help prevent this ever happening again, not just in Bosnia, but anywhere in the world. It is too late for me now, but for the children living in Bosnia now, it's not too late and I hope that this will be a good warning to them.|$|E
25|$|You have no {{idea what}} sending on those checks to me at this time. After {{fighting}} for an idea all your life I realize that your backing has saved it for me and meant to thank you with all my heart and soul for what you have done. It has been marvelous. So many letters have been written and not mailed and owing to having been in bed {{a great deal of time}} this summer, the paintings were about all I could muster up enough energy to do what I considered the best of my ability. Just before Stieglitz’s death I took some paintings to him that I considered as having something new in the. He immediately walked right up to them and spoke of the new ideas. His intuition in that way was remarkable and I am so glad to have been allowed to live during his and your lifetimes. It has been a great privilege <b>for</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> am truly thankful.|$|E

In his 1987 memoir Funu: The Unfinished Saga of East Timor, Fretilin leader José Ramos-Horta recalls his [...] "vehement protests" [...] against his party's refusal to attend the meeting.

500|$|Stoney {{initially}} {{coined the}} term electrolion in 1881. Ten years later, he switched to electron to describe these elementary charges, writing in 1894: [...] "... an estimate {{was made of the}} actual amount of this most remarkable fundamental unit of electricity, <b>for</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> have since ventured to suggest the name electron". A 1906 proposal to change to electrion failed because Hendrik Lorentz preferred to keep electron. The word electron is a combination of the words electric and ion. The suffix [...] which is now used to designate other subatomic particles, such as a proton or neutron, is in turn derived from electron.|$|E
500|$|Richard Feynman {{likewise}} held {{a favorable}} {{view of the}} house and of his tenure as Telluride House Faculty Fellow. In an interview he described the House as [...] "a group of boys that have been specially selected because of their scholarship, because of their cleverness or whatever it is, to be given free board and lodging and so on, because of their brains". He enjoyed the house's convenience and said that [...] "it’s there that I did the fundamental work" [...] for which he won the Nobel Prize. In a correspondence with a fellow Telluride associate congratulating him on the Nobel Prize, Feynman said, [...] "It was at Telluride that I did do all that stuff <b>for</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> got the prize, so I look back at those days with nostalgia." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2005, Ebert {{opined that}} video games are not art, and are {{inferior}} to media created through authorial control, such as film and literature, stating, [...] "video games can be elegant, subtle, sophisticated, challenging and visually wonderful", but [...] "the {{nature of the}} medium prevents it from moving beyond craftsmanship to the stature of art". This resulted in negative reaction from video game enthusiasts, such as writer Clive Barker, who defended video games as an art form. Ebert wrote a further piece in response to Barker. Ebert maintained his position in 2010, but conceded {{that he should not}} have expressed this skepticism without being more familiar with the actual experience of playing them. He admitted that he barely played video games: [...] "I have played Cosmology of Kyoto which I enormously enjoyed, and Myst <b>for</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> lacked the patience." ...|$|E

Nothing was cut [...] I am sorry if some members of our audience felt cheated. A photographer attended the shoot for Episode 46 and took a selection of shots of Sam and Connie.

500|$|... 2. [...] "The chief {{variable}} to choosing between a kestrel and a merlin {{may be your}} hawking land. If you live in open country, or have access at least to good pasture for cattle, a merlin can excel there. If you plan to hunt mostly in town or suburb, and especially {{if you plan to}} hawk from a car, I’d recommend the kestrel. [...] The consideration coming in at close second is your intended quarry. To snipe, dove, quail and open-country sparrows, merlins are best suited. For most blackbirds (Icteridea), either falcon can prove effective. Starlings in close are extremely vulnerable to kestrels; but in the open are best prey for merlins. [...] The same holds true for house sparrows, with this exception: sparrows in thick cover are better quarry for kestrels. This is the slip <b>for</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> feel the American kestrel is perfect." ...|$|E

Jackson in 1952, during early {{deliberations}} that led to the Brown v. Board of Education decision. In his memo, Rehnquist argued: [...] "I realize that it is an unpopular and unhumanitarian position, <b>for</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> have been excoriated by 'liberal' colleagues but I think Plessy v. Ferguson was right and should be reaffirmed." [...] Rehnquist continued, [...] "To the argument ... that a majority may not deprive a minority of its constitutional right, the answer must be made that while this is sound in theory, {{in the long run it}} is the majority who will determine what the constitutional rights of the minorities are." [...] Rehnquist also argued for Plessy with other law clerks.S. Hrg. 99-1067, Hearings Before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary on the Nomination of Justice William Hubbs Rehnquist to be Chief Justice of the United States (July 29, 30, 31, and August 1, 1986).|$|E

If {{we are going to}} be compelled to learn Hindi, I would perhaps not be able to learn it because of my age, and perhaps I would not be willing to do it because of the amount of constraint you put on me. This kind of intolerance makes us fear that the strong Centre which we need, a strong Centre which is necessary will also mean the enslavement of people who do not speak the language at the centre. I would, Sir, convey a warning on behalf of people of the South for the reason that there are already elements in South India who want separation..., and my honourable friends in U.P. do not help us in any way by flogging their idea of [...] "Hindi Imperialism" [...] to the maximum extent possible. So, it is up to my friends in Uttar Pradesh to have a whole India; it is up to them to have a Hindi-India. The choice is theirs.|$|E
500|$|On September 15, 2017, Douglas Elmendorf, {{dean of the}} Kennedy School, {{announced}} that Chelsea Manning {{had been invited to}} spend only one day at the school, and that her title of visiting fellow did not convey a special honor. [...] "We did not intend to honor her in any way," [...] Elmendorf wrote, [...] "or to endorse any of her words or deeds…. However, I now think that designating Chelsea Manning as a Visiting Fellow was a mistake, <b>for</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> accept responsibility. … Therefore, we are withdrawing the invitation to her to serve as a Visiting Fellow—and the perceived honor that it implies to some people—while maintaining the invitation for her to spend a day at the Kennedy School and speak in the Forum. I apologize to her and to the many concerned people from whom I have heard today for not recognizing upfront the full implications of our original invitation." [...] When Elmendorf phoned Manning, a member of her support team challenged him to explain why Harvard was so concerned about the title [...] "visiting fellow." [...] The team was alienated by his response, which they inferred suggested she had nothing to contribute. Manning then hung up on the dean.|$|E
500|$|In {{comparing}} {{the achievements of}} Scott and Amundsen, most polar historians generally accept that Amundsen's skills with ski and dogs, his general familiarity with ice conditions, and his clear focus on a non-scientific expedition gave him considerable advantages {{in the race for}} the Pole. Scott's verdict on the disaster that overtook his party, written when he was close to death, lists the initial loss of pony transport, weather conditions, [...] "a shortage of fuel in our depots <b>for</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> cannot account", and the sickening of Evans and Oates, but ultimately Scott concludes that [...] "our wreck is certainly due to this sudden advent of severe weather [...] on the Barrier [...] in the day, [...] at night". Presumably with regard to the failed rendez-vous with the dog teams requested for 1 March 1912, Scott furthermore wrote [...] "No-one is to blame and I hope no attempt will be made to suggest that we have lacked support". Cherry-Garrard, whom Atkinson placed in charge of the dog teams which started late, failed to meet Scott and turned for home, observes that [...] "the whole business simply bristles with 'ifs'"; an accumulation of decisions and circumstances that might have fallen differently ultimately led to catastrophe. But [...] "we were as wise as anyone can be before the event." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{cases of}} death became public, the Western Allies lodged a protest at the Soviet government. In many known cases, the Western Allies did not react to {{requests}} for help. In the case of Peter Fechter, local US soldiers stated {{that they were not}} allowed to cross border and enter East Berlin, although this was permitted to Allied military personnel when uniforms are worn. Major General Albert Watson, Town Major at that time, thus contacted his superiors in the White House, without receiving clear orders. Watson said: [...] "This is a case <b>for</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> don’t have any imperatives." [...] President Kennedy was concerned over this issue and dispatched Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy to the Town Major to call for preventative measures against such incidents. Bundy, who already resided in Berlin for a pre-scheduled visit in 1962, informed Willy Brandt about the President´s intention to back him up on this issue. He however clarified to Brandt and Adenauer, that US support ends at the wall, as there will be no efforts to dislodge it. Ten days after Fechter´s death, Konrad Adenauer contacted the French President Charles de Gaulle, to send a letter to Nikita Khrushchev through him. De Gaulle offered his cooperation. Under the involvement of Willy Brandt, the four City Commanders reached an agreement concerning military ambulances from the western allies, which were now allowed to pick up injured persons from the border zone, to bring them to hospitals in East Berlin.|$|E
