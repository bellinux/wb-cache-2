5|$|Hipólito Vieytes {{was about}} to make a {{diplomatic}} mission to Britain, but Moreno requested that he should be given the appointment instead. Saavedra accepted immediately. He traveled to Britain with his brother Manuel Moreno and his secretary Tomás Guido, on the British schooner Fame. His health declined and there was no doctor on board, but the captain refused requests to land at some earlier port such as in Río de Janeiro (Brazil) or Cape Town (South Africa). The captain gave him an emetic in common use at that time, prepared with four grams of antimony potassium tartrate. Moreno had great convulsions as a consequence, and considered that in his state he could not <b>have</b> <b>resisted</b> more than the quarter of a gram. He died shortly afterwards. His body was wrapped in a Union Jack and thrown into the sea, after a volley of musketry.|$|E
5|$|Castile regained {{control of}} Gibraltar in the Eighth Siege of 1462. The Moorish threat receded {{following}} {{the completion of}} the Reconquista and the fortifications were allowed to fall into decay, with very few cannon mounted on the batteries. In 1535, the Spanish naval commander Álvaro de Bazán the Elder warned King Charles I that Gibraltar's defences were seriously inadequate and recommended that the Line Wall Curtain be extended all the way to Europa Point on the southern tip of Gibraltar and that the town's southern wall should be strengthened. However, his advice was ignored. The soldier and writer Pedro Barrantes Maldonaldo noted that by 1540 Gibraltar's north-west bastion (presumably referring to North Bastion) had only four guns, while the castle's few guns were all dismounted (and therefore unusable), and there were no gunners. The garrison's equipment was antiquated and their numbers were few. The town's walls were still essentially medieval and could not <b>have</b> <b>resisted</b> mid-16th century artillery. The fall of Constantinople 90 years earlier showed just how vulnerable such walls could be {{in the face of a}} heavy artillery bombardment.|$|E
5|$|In any event, the {{molluscs}} and scavengers did not consume everything organic. Some of {{the wooden}} objects on the ship and in the debris field have not been consumed, particularly those made of teak, a dense wood that seems to <b>have</b> <b>resisted</b> the borers. The First Class reception area off the ships Grand Staircase is still remarkably intact and furniture is still visible among the debris on the floor. Although most of the corridors have lost their walls, furniture is still in place in many cabins; in one, a mattress {{is still on the}} bed, with an intact and undamaged dresser behind it. Robert Ballard has suggested that areas within the ship or buried under debris, where scavengers may {{not have been able to}} reach, may still contain human remains. According to Charles Pellegrino, who dived on Titanic in 2001, a finger bone encircled by the partial remains of a wedding ring was found concreted to the bottom of a soup tureen that was retrieved from the debris field. It was returned to the sea bed on the next dive.|$|E

25|$|Flynn {{developed}} a reputation for womanizing, hard drinking, chain smoking, and, {{for a time in}} the 1940s, narcotics abuse. He was linked romantically with Lupe Vélez, Marlene Dietrich, and Dolores del Río, among many others.

He was a regular attendee of William Randolph Hearst's equally lavish affairs at Hearst Castle, though he was once asked to leave after becoming excessively intoxicated.|$|E

25|$|Electrical {{wiring and}} indoor {{plumbing}} {{have been added}} to many mosques in Mali. In some cases, the original surfaces of a mosque have even been tiled over, destroying its historical appearance and in some cases compromising the building's structural integrity. While the Great Mosque has been equipped with a loudspeaker system, the citizens of Djenné <b>have</b> <b>resisted</b> modernization in favor of the building's historical integrity. Many historical preservationists have praised the community's preservation effort, and interest in this aspect of the building grew in the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Also {{based in}} Shizuoka are Honda F.C. and Fujieda MYFC, {{although}} neither currently {{play at the}} same level as S-Pulse, limiting any potential rivalry development to one-off cup pairings. Fujieda MYFC and Honda F.C. play just below the J. league in the Japan Football League. Despite always performing well, Honda FC <b>have</b> <b>resisted</b> professionalisation and so are unable to join the J. League. The forerunners to Avispa Fukuoka and Sagan Tosu were originally also based in Shizuoka Prefecture, but had to move to Kyushu because of the dominance and fan saturation of S-Pulse and Iwata.|$|E

25|$|Also in 794, Emperor Constantine VI (r. 776–797) {{decided to}} {{separate}} from his first wife, Maria of Amnia, and to marry Maria's kubikularia (Lady-in-waiting), Theodote, a cousin of Theodore the Studite. Although the Patriarch may initially <b>have</b> <b>resisted</b> this development, as a divorce without proof of adultery {{on the part of}} the wife could be construed as illegal, he ultimately gave way. The marriage of Constantine and Theodote was celebrated in 795, although not by the patriarch, as was normal, but by a certain Joseph, a priest of Hagia Sophia.|$|E
25|$|Some institutions, such as Rhodes College and Franklin and Marshall, <b>have</b> <b>resisted</b> change, {{preferring to}} {{construct}} {{in the same}} styles originally employed on their campuses. This has led to continuous Collegiate Gothic construction at Rhodes. At Franklin and Marshall, this has meant Georgian and Colonial revival buildings {{in the style of}} Charles Klauder designed by architects such as Robert A. M. Stern and the firm of Einhorn Yaffee Prescott. These decisions have sometimes been controversial, {{as was the case with}} Whitman College, due to expense, perceived difficulty of use by students, or disdain for the eschewing of new styles in favor of historicism.|$|E
25|$|The {{debate over}} whether to move to annual {{sessions}} is a long-standing battle in Oregon politics, but the voters <b>have</b> <b>resisted</b> the move from citizen legislators to professional lawmakers. Because Oregon's state budget is written in two-year increments and, there being no sales tax, state revenue is based largely on income taxes, it is often significantly over- or under-budget. Recent legislatures {{have had to be}} called into special session repeatedly to address revenue shortfalls resulting from economic downturns, bringing to a head the need for more frequent legislative sessions. Oregon Initiative 71, passed in 2010, mandates the legislature to begin meeting every year, for 160 days in odd-numbered years, and 35 days in even-numbered years.|$|E
