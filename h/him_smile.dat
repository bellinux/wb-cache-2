5|$|There {{are those}} who will {{consider}} it their duty, as friends of the Negro people, to tell us to revile him, to flee, even from the presence of his memory, to save ourselves by writing {{him out of the}} history of our turbulent times. Many will ask what Harlem finds to honor in this stormy, controversial and bold young captainand we will smile. Many will say turn awayaway from this man, for he is not a man but a demon, a monster, a subverter and an enemy of the black manand we will smile. They will say that he is of hatea fanatic, a racistwho can only bring evil to the cause for which you struggle! And we will answer and say to them: Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you ever touch him, or have <b>him</b> <b>smile</b> at you? Did you ever really listen to him? Did he ever do a mean thing? Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance? For if you did you would know him. And if you knew him you would know why we must honor him... And, in honoring him, we honor the best in ourselves.|$|E

2500|$|By 1980, Jones {{had not had}} {{a number}} one single in six years and many critics began to write him off. [...] However, the singer stunned the music {{industry}} in April when [...] "He Stopped Loving Her Today" [...] was released and shot to number one on the country charts, remaining there for 18 weeks. The song was written by Bobby Braddock and Curly Putman and {{tells the story of a}} friend who has never given up on his love; he keeps old letters and photos from back in the day and hangs on to hope that she would [...] "come back again". The song reaches its peak in the chorus, revealing that he indeed stopped loving her—when he died—and the woman does return—for his funeral. Jones' interpretation, buoyed by his delivery of the line [...] "...first time I'd seen <b>him</b> <b>smile</b> in years", gives it a mournful, gripping realism. It is consistently voted as the greatest country song of all time, along with [...] "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry" [...] by Hank Williams and [...] "Crazy" [...] by Patsy Cline.|$|E
