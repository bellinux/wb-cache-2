5|$|During the 1990s, bulkers were {{involved}} in an alarming number of shipwrecks. This led ship-owners to commission a study seeking to explain the effect of various <b>factors</b> <b>on</b> the crew's effectiveness and competence. The study showed that crew performance aboard bulk carriers was the lowest of all groups studied. Among bulker crews, the best performance was found aboard younger and larger ships. Crews on better-maintained ships performed better, as did crews on ships where fewer languages were spoken.|$|E

Though it is accepted that energy consumption in excess of energy expenditure leads to obesity on an individual basis, {{the cause of the}} shifts in these two <b>factors</b> <b>on</b> the societal scale is much debated. There are a number of theories as to the cause but most believe it is a combination of various factors.|$|E

An inquiry determined that modifications to the windscreen had contributed to the accident but the main factor had been the pilot's handling of the highly sensitive controls. Engineers recalculated the stress <b>factors</b> <b>on</b> the airframe and they {{were found to be}} safe; the crash was attributed to pilot error and the sensitivity of the controls.|$|E

How the influence of service quality <b>factor</b> <b>on</b> trust <b>factor</b> and value factor, the influence of trust <b>factor</b> <b>on</b> value <b>factor,</b> the indirect influence of service quality <b>factor</b> <b>on</b> satisfaction through trust and through value. It used Purposive Sampling, there are 108 samples as respondents of all population in LPK Kharisma, LP 3 I and Borneo Training Center. The analysis technique used Structural Equation Modeling with Confirmatory Factor Analysis and Regression. The results showed that service quality factors {{have an effect on}} the level of satisfaction. but the trust and the value factors don’t {{have an effect on the}} level of satisfaction. Service quality factor have an effect on the trust and the value, which states that the trust factors have an effect on the value. There is an indirect influence of service quality <b>factor</b> <b>on</b> satisfaction through trust, but there isn’t an indirect influence of service quality <b>factor</b> <b>on</b> satisfaction through value.

5|$|The {{evolutionary}} biologist Ernst Mayr {{was influenced}} by the work of the German biologist Bernhard Rensch showing the influence of local environmental <b>factors</b> <b>on</b> the geographic distribution of sub-species and closely related species. Mayr followed up on Dobzhansky's work with the 1942 book Systematics and the Origin of Species, which emphasized the importance of allopatric speciation in the formation of new species. This form of speciation occurs when the geographical isolation of a sub-population is followed by the development of mechanisms for reproductive isolation. Mayr also formulated the biological species concept that defined a species as a group of interbreeding or potentially interbreeding populations that were reproductively isolated from all other populations.|$|E
