5|$|Francis has {{individualized}} features, to {{the point}} that the attention to his face gives it the quality of a portrait such as van Eyck's c. 1431 Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati.

He <b>is</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> highly intelligent but perhaps detached and impassive individual. He is given a complex and inscrutable expression; physiological traits not uncommon in contemporary Flemish painting. He kneels on a bed of flowers, and his heavy robe and folded drapery have a choppy and overflowing feel. His lower limbs seem disconnected, positioned in an anti-naturalistic manner; giving the impression that he is levitating.|$|E

5|$|Mary <b>is</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Marian apparition; in {{this case}} she {{probably}} appears before a donor, {{who would have been}} kneeling in prayer in the now lost opposite panel.
