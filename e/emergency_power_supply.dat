5000|$|Availability of {{reliable}} pumps allows lifting accumulations {{of water into}} gravity sewers from collection sumps in excavations like mines or building foundations; {{but the cost of}} pumping surface runoff discourages use of lift stations in storm drains or combined sewers. The capitalized cost of operation and maintenance of lift stations and <b>emergency</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> usually justifies considerable first cost for excavation or tunneling to build a gravity sewer. Sewage treatment is most efficient at centralized locations; and pumping is often required to lift sewage from lower elevations to the sewage treatment plant headworks. Structures called regulators allow overflow into gravity outfall sewers when peak flow in combined sewers exceeds pumping capacity. Sanitary sewers are preferred for cost-effective pumping of sewage when treatment is required. Gravity sewers are preferred where grades are favorable, but lift stations often move sewage to sewage treatment plants.|$|R

40|$|Passive cooling systems {{sometimes}} use natural circulation, {{and they}} are not dependent on <b>emergency</b> AC <b>power</b> or offsite power, which can make designs simpler through the reduction of <b>emergency</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplying</b> infrastructure. The passive system approach can lead to substantial simplification of the system as well as overall economic benefits, and passive systems are believed to be less vulnerable to accidents by component failures and human errors compared to active systems. The viewpoint that passive system design is more reliable and more economical than active system design has become generally accepted. However, passive systems have characteristics of a high level of uncertainty and low driving force for purposes of heat removal phenomena. These characteristics of passive systems can result in increasing system unreliability and may raise potential remedial costs during a system's lifetime.

5000|$|Inadequate {{last mile}} {{connectivity}} {{is the main}} problem to supply electricity for all users. The country already has adequate generation and transmission capacity to meet the full demand temporally and spatially. However, {{due to lack of}} last-mile link-up with all electricity consumers and reliable power supply (to exceed 99%), many consumers depend on DG sets using costly diesel oil for meeting unavoidable power requirements. Also more than 10 million households are using battery storage UPS as back-up in case of load shedding. India imports nearly US$2 billion worth of battery storage UPS every year. The distribution companies should focus on providing uninterrupted power supply to all the consumers who are using costly DG set's power. This should be achieved by laying separate buried power cables (not to be effected by rain and winds) for <b>emergency</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> in addition to the normal supply lines.
