5|$|On July 4, 2007, Jew's {{attorneys}} {{issued a}} 138-page response to Herrera's petition, arguing {{that even if}} Jew had not lived full-time in his home in District 4, his election had not violated any laws. They also accused Herrara of political bias in bringing the charges. Herrera denied Jew's accusations, and released signed bank loan documents on which Jew <b>had</b> <b>identified</b> his address in Burlingame.

Wilk <b>had</b> <b>identified</b> one atom of the decay product 266Bh as {{decaying}} with identical properties to what the Japanese team had observed, thus lending support for their claim. However, they also observed the daughter of 266Bh, 262Db, undergo alpha decay instead of spontaneous fission: the Japanese team observed the latter decay mode.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Witten's announcement, string theorists <b>had</b> <b>identified</b> five {{versions}} of superstring theory. Although these theories appeared, at first, {{to be very}} different, work by several physicists showed that the theories were related in intricate and nontrivial ways. In particular, physicists found that apparently distinct theories could be unified by mathematical transformations called S-duality and T-duality. Witten's conjecture was {{based in part on}} the existence of these dualities and in part on the relationship of the string theories to a field theory called eleven-dimensional supergravity.|$|E

5|$|A 1980 US {{indictment}} {{said that}} Francisco Rafael was {{under investigation by}} the DEA for alleged cocaine and heroin distribution in the San Diego area. The DEA <b>had</b> <b>identified</b> him as one of the cocaine suppliers and set up an undercover operation to arrest him and his associates by purchasing multi-ton shipments of cocaine. He admitted to have worked with drug distributor Ramón Torresillos-Rendón, and that he used him as a mediator for a drug transaction with an undercover federal agent. In court, Francisco Rafael admitted having sent Torresillos-Rendón and four other individuals to sell nine ounces of cocaine to the agent. He was arrested in California on 7 August 1980 and remained under custody until or around 8 September 1980 after paying a US$150,000 bond and promising to appear at every court session. Nonetheless, he fled to Mexico shortly afterwards and did not appear in court on 8 October 1980.|$|E
5|$|American {{astronomer}} Edwin Hubble categorized M87 {{as one of}} {{the brighter}} globular nebulae, as it lacked any spiral structure, but appeared to belong to the same family of non-galactic nebulae as spiral nebulae. In 1926 he produced a new categorization of nebulae, with M87 being classified as a type of elliptical extra-galactic nebula with no apparent elongation (class E0). By 1931, Hubble <b>had</b> <b>identified</b> M87 {{as a member of the}} Virgo Cluster, for which he gave a provisional estimate of 1.8 million parsecs from Earth. At the time it was the only known example of an elliptical nebula for which individual stars could be resolved. M87 continued to be called an extragalactic nebula for many years thereafter, but by 1956 it had been identified as an E0-type galaxy.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the Allied landing, Imperial Japanese Army forces in the Admiralties {{consisted}} of the 51st Transport Regiment under Colonel Yoshio Ezaki, who was also the overall garrison commander; 2ndBattalion, 1st Independent Mixed Regiment; 1stBattalion, 229th Infantry Regiment; and elements of the IJN's 14th Naval Base Force. Allied G-2 <b>had</b> <b>identified</b> the presence of all these units in the Admiralties, though their designation was not known in all instances. While the 1stBattalion, 229thInfantry Regiment was a veteran of several campaigns, it was short of equipment and lacked its battalion artillery guns. The 2ndBattalion, 1st Independent Mixed Regiment was led by reserve officers who had seen action in China, but most of its enlisted men were recalled reservists who had not previously been in battle.|$|E

Comparing rats and humans, he <b>has</b> <b>identified</b> 61 homologous nuclei. He <b>has</b> <b>identified</b> 180 nuclei and homologies in birds. He {{was the first}} to produce a reliable stereotaxic space for the brain of rats, mice, and primates — a factor fueling the explosion in neuroscience research since the 1980s. He developed the first comprehensive nomenclature and ontology for the brain, covering humans, birds, and developing mammals.|$|R
5|$|By 20 March, Jordan <b>had</b> <b>identified</b> {{parts of}} the Israeli 7th Armored Brigade, 60th Armored Brigade, 35th Paratroop Brigade, 80th Infantry Brigade, a combat {{engineer}} battalion and five artillery battalions between Allenby and Damia bridges. The Jordanians assumed the Israelis were planning an attack with a drive on Amman, and the army took up positions near the bridges, with the 60th Armored Brigade joining the 1st Infantry Division. Jordan also added most of its armored car, antitank and artillery units to the 1st Infantry Division. The total firepower was 105 Patton tanks and 88 artillery pieces. The infantry divisions were deployed near the bridges, each with a tank company. The artillery was mostly deployed on the higher Jordan Valley ridges overlooking Karameh for topological advantage.|$|E
5|$|Despite the club's relegation to League One {{and another}} spell in administration, Wetherall {{turned down a}} move away from Bradford City after {{snubbing}} Coventry City during the 2004 summer. In October 2004, Wetherall and fellow veteran player Dean Windass both signed year's extensions to their contracts, with Wetherall's keeping him at Bradford {{until the end of}} the 2007–08 season. He also put his injury problems to one side for the 2004–05 season and missed just one league game – a 1–1 draw with Walsall in February when he was ruled out because of suspension ending his run of 42 consecutive games. Bradford manager Colin Todd <b>had</b> <b>identified</b> Wetherall as a key player for the season, but despite scoring four goals and striker Windass' 27 goals earning him the league's top scorer's crown, Bradford could only finish 11th.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a request}} from the Chief of Combined Operations Admiral Louis Mountbatten for probes of German coastal defences, No. 62 Commando, {{also known as the}} Small Scale Raiding Force (SSRF), mounted a number of {{operations}} in 1942. The first three missions were complete successes: Operation Barricade (14/15 August 1942), Operation Dryad, (2/3 September 1942), and Operation Pound (7/8 September 1942). Aquatint was planned for a night in mid September 1942 as a reconnaissance mission near Sainte-Honorine-des-Pertes, a small coastal town near Port en Bessin in Normandy. The mission was to collect information about the surrounding area, and take a German guard prisoner. Aerial reconnaissance <b>had</b> <b>identified</b> a small group of houses on the seafront thought to be occupied by Germans.|$|E

5|$|Following his 150th appearance, Selwood {{displayed}} {{an improved}} goal kicking ability by kicking 17 {{goals in the}} remaining 7 games of the season. His coach Chris Scott acknowledged that Selwood <b>had</b> <b>identified</b> goal kicking as an area of improvement within his game, and credited Selwood for taking responsibility {{to work hard and}} improve at it. Geelong began their finals series against Fremantle in a Qualifying Final, but were defeated by 15points. The defeat forced the club into a Semi Final against Port Adelaide—the first finals game between both clubs since the 2007 AFL Grand Final. Selwood contributed 27 disposals, 4 marks, and 4 tackles to lead Geelong to a 16point victory—his first finals win as captain. The win ensured Geelong's progression through to the Preliminary Final against Hawthorn, to play-off for a position in the 2013 AFL Grand Final. Despite Selwood's contribution of 23 disposals, 4 tackles, and 1 goal however, the Cats were defeated by 5points and finished the season in third place.|$|E
5|$|Four stone {{courses of}} the eastern spring of the arch, {{consisting}} of a row of impost blocks and three layers of voussoirs, have survived to modern times. This remnant was first identified in 1838 by Biblical scholar Edward Robinson and now bears his name. At that time, prior to any excavations, remains of the arch were at ground level. The ancient street level lay far underground, buried by debris from destruction of structures on the Temple Mount and later fill dumped into the Tyropoeon Valley over the centuries. Robinson believed he <b>had</b> <b>identified</b> {{the eastern edge of}} a bridge that linked the Temple Compound with the Upper City which lay on the ridge to the west.|$|E
5|$|In 1789, Antoine Lavoisier {{published}} {{a list of}} 33 chemical elements, grouping them into gases, metals, nonmetals, and earths. Chemists spent the following century searching for a more precise classification scheme. In 1829, Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner observed {{that many of the}} elements could be grouped into triads based on their chemical properties. Lithium, sodium, and potassium, for example, were grouped together in a triad as soft, reactive metals. Döbereiner also observed that, when arranged by atomic weight, the second member of each triad was roughly the average of the first and the third; this became known as the Law of Triads. German chemist Leopold Gmelin worked with this system, and by 1843 he <b>had</b> <b>identified</b> ten triads, three groups of four, and one group of five. Jean-Baptiste Dumas published work in 1857 describing relationships between various groups of metals. Although various chemists were able to identify relationships between small groups of elements, they had yet to build one scheme that encompassed them all.|$|E
