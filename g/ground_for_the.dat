5|$|Friedrich Alefeld (1820–1872), {{who used}} Latin variety names, in a {{monographic}} study of beans, lentils and other legumes distinguished three infraspecific taxonomic categories: Unterart (subspecies), Varietäten Gruppe and Kultur-Varietät, all with Latin names.

In conjunction with the Brussels International Botanical Congress of 1910 there was an International Horticultural Congress having a horticultural nomenclature component.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} eighteenth century Scotland gained many of the organisations {{associated}} with the revival in England, including Sunday schools, mission schools, ragged schools, Bible societies and improvement classes. Because the revival occurred {{at the same time as}} the transformation of the Highlands into a crofting society, Evangelicalism was often linked to popular protest against patronage and the clearances, while the Moderates became identified with the interests of the landholding classes. It laid the <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Great Disruption in the mid-nineteenth century, leading to the Evangelicals taking control of the General Assembly and those in the Highlands joining the Free Church of Scotland in large numbers.|$|E
5|$|He became captain-coach of the Berri Football Club in 1923. Berri Football Club replanted a new oval in 1927 and Harold Oliver {{worked as}} a groundskeeper.

He played his last ever football game in 1931 when his club won the Upper Murray Association premiership defeating Barmera. During the match he kicked six goals from six shots at goal.

5|$|Indonesia kept East Timor {{shut off}} from the rest of the world, except for a few years in the late 1980s and early 1990s, {{claiming}} that the vast majority of East Timorese supported integration. This position was followed closely by the Indonesian media such that an East Timorese acceptance of their integration with Indonesia was taken for granted by, and was a non-issue for, the majority of Indonesians. East Timor came to be seen as a training <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> officer corps in tactics of suppression for Aceh and Papua, and was pivotal in ensuring military sector dominance of Indonesia.|$|E

5|$|Many of the representations, both finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional, are {{important}} in theoretical physics.

The representation theory also provides the theoretical <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> concept of spin.

5|$|Raymond {{purchased}} {{land in the}} Nishi Azabu {{district of}} Tokyo to build his new office and living quarters. The office was built using the traditional Japanese post and lintel type construction using unplaned timber logs. The office served as a proving <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> latest American building innovations including veneered plywood and suspended metal ductwork for forced air heating. Taking influence from Le Corbusier's modulor, Raymond used the traditional Japanese module of the ken (based upon the size of tatami mats) as a unit of measure to set out the building's structure. Again he used fusuma partitions and shoji screens, but in a modern way to divide up the spaces.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{have suggested that}} Muḥammad used the term Allah in addressing both pagan Arabs and Jews or Christians {{in order to establish}} a common <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> understanding of the name for God, a claim Gerhard Böwering says is doubtful. According to Böwering, in contrast with pre-Islamic Arabian polytheism, God in Islam does not have associates and companions, nor is there any kinship between God and jinn. Pre-Islamic pagan Arabs believed in a blind, powerful, inexorable and insensible fate over which man had no control. This was replaced with the Islamic notion of a powerful but provident and merciful God.|$|E

5|$|The magma in {{volcanic}} pipes {{is usually}} {{one of two}} characteristic types, which cool into igneous rock known as either kimberlite or lamproite. The magma itself does not contain diamond; instead, it acts as an elevator that carries deep-formed rocks (xenoliths), minerals (xenocrysts), and fluids upward. These rocks are characteristically rich in magnesium-bearing olivine, pyroxene, and amphibole minerals which are often altered to serpentine by heat and fluids during and after eruption. Certain indicator minerals typically occur within diamantiferous kimberlites and are used as mineralogical tracers by prospectors, who follow the indicator trail back to the volcanic pipe which may contain diamonds. These minerals are rich in chromium (Cr) or titanium (Ti), elements which impart bright colors to the minerals. The most common indicator minerals are chromium garnets (usually bright red chromium-pyrope, and occasionally green ugrandite-series garnets), eclogitic garnets, orange titanium-pyrope, red high-chromium spinels, dark chromite, bright green chromium-diopside, glassy green olivine, black picroilmenite, and magnetite. Kimberlite deposits are known as blue <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> deeper serpentinized part of the deposits, or as yellow <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> near surface smectite clay and carbonate weathered and oxidized portion.|$|E
5|$|The ship's {{assignment}} at {{the beginning}} of the Pacific War was to support the invasion of the Philippines, initially by attacking the American naval base at Davao, Mindanao on the morning of 8 December. Her air group had not changed, but four of each type of aircraft were spares. Ryūjōs initial airstrike consisted of 13 B5Ns escorted by nine A5Ms with a smaller, follow-on airstrike later in the day by two B5Ns and three A5Ms. They accomplished little, destroying two Consolidated PBY seaplanes on the <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> loss of one B5N and A5M. The ship covered the landing at Davao on 20 December and her B5Ns attacked a British oil tanker south of Davao. In January 1942 her aircraft supported Japanese operations in the Malay Peninsula.|$|E
