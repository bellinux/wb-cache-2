5|$|Equality {{in matters}} of public employment: Article 16 of the {{constitution}} lays down that the State cannot discriminate against anyone in the matters of employment. All citizens can apply for government jobs. There are some exceptions. The Parliament may enact a law stating that certain jobs can be filled only by applicants who are domiciled in the area. This may be meant for posts that require knowledge of the locality and language of the area. The State may also reserve posts for members of backward classes, scheduled castes or scheduled tribes which are not adequately represented <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>services</b> under the State {{to bring up the}} weaker sections of the society. Also, there a law may be passed that requires that the holder of an office of any religious institution shall also be a person professing that particular religion.

5|$|The Cooperativa Obrera Mataronense (Mataró Workers' Cooperative) was Gaudí's {{first big}} project, {{on which he}} worked from 1878 to 1882, for Salvador Pagès i Anglada.

In the factory roof Gaudí used the catenary arch {{for the first time}}, with a bolt assembly system devised by Philibert de l'Orme. He also used ceramic tile decoration for the first time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>services</b> building. Gaudí laid out the site taking account of solar orientation, another signature of his works, and included landscaped areas.

5|$|The {{labour force}} is 2.45million people, of whom 7.1 per cent are {{employed}} in agriculture, 35.2 per cent {{are employed in}} industry and 57.7 per cent are employed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>services</b> sector. Extraction of metals and minerals, production of chemicals, machinery and vehicle components, petroleum refining and steel are among the major industrial activities. Mining and its related industries employ a total of 120,000 people and generate about five per cent of the country's GDP. Bulgaria is Europe's sixth-largest coal producer. Local deposits of coal, iron, copper and lead are vital for the manufacturing and energy sectors. Almost all top export items of Bulgaria are industrial commodities such as oil products, copper products and pharmaceuticals. Bulgaria is also a net exporter of agricultural and food products, of which two-thirds go to OECD countries. It is the largest global producer of perfumery essential oils such as lavender and rose oil. Agriculture has declined significantly {{in the past two}} decades. Production in 2008 amounted to only 66 per cent of that between 1999 and 2001, while cereal and vegetable yields have dropped by nearly 40 per cent since 1990. Of the services sector, tourism is the most significant contributor to economic growth. In recent years, Bulgaria has emerged as a travelling destination with its inexpensive resorts and beaches outside the reach of the tourist industry. Lonely Planet ranked it among its top 10 destinations for 2011. Most of the visitors are British, Romanian, German and Russian. The capital Sofia, the medieval capital Veliko Tarnovo, coastal resorts Golden Sands and Sunny Beach and winter resorts Bansko, Pamporovo and Borovets are some of the locations most visited by tourists.|$|E
