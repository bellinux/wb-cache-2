40|$|The {{administration}} of the relevant part of <b>EAGGF</b> Guarantee expenditure, which {{accounts for more than}} 50 % of the budget of the European Communities follows shared management arrangements. Shared management means that member states pay and control the expenditure for agricultural and rural development subsidies and the Commission is responsible for the {{administration of}} payments and for auditing the control system of member states. The communication on the expenditure effected by accredited paying agencies takes place via a comprehensive financial reporting system and monthly <b>EAGGF</b> Committee meetings. These meetings provide scope for the reconciliation of any disagreement concerning the monthly advances reimbursed by the Commission to member states and also give an overview on actual budget implementation. The new member states which joined the European Union on 1 May 2004 have started to apply the comprehensive financial reporting system following an intensive cooperation period in the form of training seminars provided to them by the Commission for setting up the reporting systems of paying agencies. The first expenditure from the <b>EAGGF</b> Guarantee Section was executed in July 2004 and reported to the Commission during the following month. The pioneer new member states were the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland, followed by Hungary, Estonia and Slovenia a month later. Until the end of August approximately 6 million Euros have been withdrawn from the Fund, used in a fifty-fifty percent split for export restitutions for milk and milk products, beef and veal, live animals and eggs to countries outside the European Union and for other market intervention measures, such as supply of food from intervention stocks for distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community, production refunds on sugar used in the chemical industry, aid for skimmed milk processed into casein and school milk. By the end of the 2004 financial year (15 October 2004) some other new member states, Lithuania, Latvia and Cyprus also intend to start paying agricultural subsidies to their beneficiaries. The total estimated value of expenditure to be withdrawn from <b>EAGGF</b> Guarantee by the new member states in the 2004 financial year and charged therefore to the 2004 budget is circa an additional 14 million Euros. Therefore, the aggregated amount of the subsidy withdrawn by the EU- 10 countries charged to the 2004 budget will be ca. 20 million Euros, which is a minor amount compared to the budget appropriations included in the 2004 budget for <b>EAGGF</b> Guarantee as a whole. A speeding up of subsidy withdrawals is necessary for new member states to make the best use of benefit from CAP. It is possible to achieve this goal by the withdrawal of subsidies for direct aids. Direct aids can be paid to farmers in the framework of the Single Area Payment Scheme from {{the first day of the}} 2005 financial year (16 October 2004) in case of new member states (except Malta and Slovenia). The advances to member states will be reimbursed in January 2005 and charged therefore to the 2005 budget. As it was the case for earlier enlargements of the European Union, the first months of subsidy withdrawals are being used mainly to get acquainted with the administration and to test the operation of the paying agency systems. However, this period should be considered strictly as an interim phase and significant effort should be made by the national agricultural administrations to widen the â€œpenetrabilityâ€ of the subsidy handling, that is to increase the amount of subsidy withdrawn from the EU by the paying agency systems already operating in the new member states to benefit from the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union. withdrawn from the EU Funds, target branches, paying agency systems, Agricultural and Food Policy, Crop Production/Industries, Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|E

40|$|The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF), and the {{guidance}} {{element of the}} European Guidance and Guarantee Fund (<b>EAGGF)</b> associated with the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) constitute the Structural Funds of the European Community. Each of these Funds was begun separately and was designed to meet particular needs. For example, the Regional Fund was originally designed {{to mitigate the effect}} on regions of the Community of existing inequalities by region, adverse effects resulting from the operation of the Rome Treaty, and a natural tendency to centralisation and the effects this has on the periphery, while the Guidance section of the European Guidance and Guarantee Fund was focused on structural improvement in farming. The Act establishing the Single Market (the Single European Act) required that these funds be reorganised to become more effective. The 1988 Community budget settlement agreed that the ERDF and the ESF should increase, with the level of spending in 1993 double that of 1987, and with a concentration of spending in poorer regions. This was taken further in 1989 when Heads of State and Government, taking not only the ERDF and ESF but the <b>EAGGF</b> (Guidance Section) and the European Investment Bank (EIB), established the Community Support Framework (CSF) - namely the set of reorganised Structural Funds, designed, as the name implies, to support development in areas whose own resources were inadequate to reduce inequalities between regions within the EC.

A model was designed and applied to the Irish dairy replacement problem, which included in the decision making process production, fertility, calving interval, seasonality, month of calving and various economic factors. The output from the Hierarchic model is a series of rankings. The dynamic programming approach can enable one to inform a farmer which cows in the herd should be replaced, on the basis that a replacement heifer(and its future successors) are expected to be more profitable than the current cow. The optimum replacement rate was 17. 8 % from this analysis. End of Project ReportsEuropean Union Structural Fund (<b>EAGGF...</b>|$|E
