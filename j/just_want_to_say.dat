I'm not trying to kiss too much butt, but he's a ripper, an original ripper ... He's an original Coors.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never have}} had one myself," [...] said Mr. Crawley.

And you will tell your children of the Idea we fought and died for--teach them it must be lived for as well as died for, else the price paid for it will have been given for nought. This will be part of your work, Rilla. And if you--all you girls back in the homeland--do it, then we who don't come back will know that you have not 'broken faith' with us.|$|E

It’s a documentary about SeaWorld and the mistreatment of the whales and dolphins and the abuse. It’s like these whales are highly intelligent creatures with huge brains and social systems that they’re used to. They’re used to being in families of 10 or more and they’re used to communicating vocally. They’re very smart, intelligent animals, and Seaworld keeps them in these little pools {{the size of a}} bathtub to us. These are huge animals that are used to swimming more than 100 miles per day and they’re in this little bathtub, and it’s like, “What the fuck?” Blackfish kind of pointed out that this is barbaric and it’s super old school. I’m surprised that we still do this and people are still entertained by having these huge whales clap and do a backflip in a pool for a couple fish. It’s kind of just fucked up, and I watched that and I <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something. I was fired up about it and I <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something man. Laughs. And that’s what happened." ...|$|R
