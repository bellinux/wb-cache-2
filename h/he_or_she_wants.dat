5|$|Our perceptual {{experiences}} {{depend on}} stimuli that arrive at our various sensory organs from the external world, and these stimuli cause {{changes in our}} mental states, ultimately causing us to feel a sensation, which may be pleasant or unpleasant. Someone's desire for a slice of pizza, for example, will tend to cause that person to move his or her body in a specific manner and in a specific direction to obtain what <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>wants.</b> The question, then, is {{how it can be}} possible for conscious experiences to arise out of a lump of gray matter endowed with nothing but electrochemical properties.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} {{intrinsic}} motivation is when an employee becomes an IT professional because <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> {{to learn about}} how computer users interact with computer networks.

5000|$|During the {{classical}} period of Roman law (late Republic and Principate), {{a man or}} woman could end a marriage simply because <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> to, and for no other reason. Unless the wife could prove the spouse was worthless, he kept the children. Because property had been kept separate during the marriage, divorce from a [...] "free" [...] marriage was a very easy procedure.|$|R
25|$|In an English auction, a dummy bid is a bid {{made by a}} dummy bidder {{acting in}} {{collusion}} with the auctioneer or vendor, designed to deceive genuine bidders into paying more. In a first-price auction, a dummy bid is an unfavourable bid designed {{so as not to}} become the winning bid. (The bidder does not want to win this auction, but <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> to make sure to be invited to the next auction).|$|E
25|$|National laws of Malaysia require Muslim apostates {{who seek}} to convert from Islam to another {{religion}} to first obtain approval from a sharia court. The procedure demands that anyone born to a Muslim parent, or who previously converted to Islam, must declare himself apostate of Islam before a Sharia court if <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> to convert. The Sharia courts {{have the power to}} impose penalties such as jail, caning and enforced “rehabilitation” on apostates – which is the typical practice. In the states of Perak, Malacca, Sabah, and Pahang, apostates of Islam face jail term; in Pahang, caning; others, confinement with rehabilitation process.|$|E
25|$|After {{finishing}} elementary school, {{students are}} obliged to take one year in high school. They are able to pick from Gymnasium, which {{is seen as the}} highest level of high-school education and usually considered as a preparatory school for attending a university, although anyone can apply to any university. Besides Gymnasiums, Slovakia has specialised high schools with bacalaureat and specialised highschools without bacalaureat. Schools with bacalaureat take 5 years to complete while the ones without usually take less. Gymnasiums and many other high schools require passing an entry exam, consider previous study results or perform a combination of both before accepting a new student. A student may apply to two high schools at once. If student fails to get accepted in any high school, the student can submit an appeal or seek a third high school with an empty slot for one more student outside of the standard application process. Parents and students prefer to avoid this uncertainty and tend to choose at least one high school with a high chance of acceptance. Most high-schools are finished by passing a matura exam, which consists of Slovak language and literature, one foreign language and one specialised subject. If school offered multiple specializations or taught multiple foreign languages, student may choose which subject <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> to do the matura exam in. If student wants and the school allows it, it's possible to do matura exam in more than three subjects.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the bonus}} round, the celebrity had 30 seconds to {{communicate}} a [...] "potluck" [...] {{subject to the}} contestant (who was not told the category of the subject). The contestant could yell out as many guesses as <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> without having to buzz in or explain it, and if the subject was successfully guessed, he/she was awarded a 13" [...] color television set.|$|R
5000|$|The {{second part}} {{involved}} the three winners of each game, with each contestant begging and pleading {{to the audience}} why <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to go on the}} grand prize vacation.

However, an individual had the choice to renounce any time <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted,</b> including straight after student life.|$|R

2500|$|A fictional {{system of}} {{currency}} {{is used by}} the wizards of the United Kingdom. The currency uses only coins as the units of account. It is based on three types of coin; in order of decreasing value, the gold Galleon, the silver Sickle, and the bronze Knut. Wizarding banks provide money-changing services for those with Muggle currency. The only bank seen in the Harry Potter series is Gringotts, which is located on Diagon Alley in London and has hundreds of vaults. In these vaults, a person can keep whatever <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>wants.</b> [...] Hagrid indicates that wizards have [...] "just the one" [...] bank.|$|E
2500|$|Viewers {{of child}} {{pornography}} who are pedophiles are particularly obsessive about collecting, organizing, categorizing, and labeling their child pornography collection according to age, gender, sex act and fantasy. According to FBI agent Ken Lanning, [...] "collecting" [...] pornography {{does not mean that}} they merely view pornography, but that they save it, and [...] "it comes to define, fuel, and validate their most cherished sexual fantasies." [...] An extensive collection indicates a strong sexual preference for children, and if a collector {{of child pornography}} is also a pedophile, the owned collection is the single best indicator of what <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> to do.

50|$|For {{the first}} several weeks, there was an {{additional}} step following the reveal of the $5,000 card. Each player, in turn, was asked if <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to hold onto the}} card <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> currently held, <b>or</b> if they wished to trade with a randomly selected opponent, including the holder of the $5,000. After all six players had made this decision, whoever was left with the $5,000 card was given the option to retire from play or trade cards, and gameplay continued as described above.|$|R
5000|$|The {{meaning of}} the term [...] "type" [...] in {{computer}} science is rather similar to the {{meaning of the}} word [...] "type" [...] in everyday language. For example, a barman can ask a client what type of beverage does <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> coffee, tea <b>or</b> beer? A particular cup of coffee that the client receives is in the role of an instance, while two cups of coffee would form a set of two instances of coffee, determining its type at the same time.|$|R
50|$|The team leader, one of {{the hosts}} of the show, has an {{opportunity}} to save a contestant to play again. But the right can be used only ONCE during the whole episode. If the two contestants of one part are both wiped out, the leader should decide whether <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> to use it if the right is still available. If someone saved by his or her team leader is wiped out again, or both of the players are phased out, the game immediately ends and the team is automatically eliminated from the track.|$|R
2500|$|The First Amendment (1791) prohibits Congress from obstructing the {{exercise}} of certain individual freedoms: freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, and right to petition. Its Free Exercise Clause guarantees a person's right to hold whatever religious beliefs <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>wants,</b> and to freely exercise that belief, and its Establishment Clause prevents the federal government from creating an official national church or favoring one set of religious beliefs over another. The amendment guarantees an individual's right to express and {{to be exposed to}} a wide range of opinions and views. It was intended to ensure a free exchange of ideas, even unpopular ones. [...] It also guarantees an individual's right to physically gather or associate with others in groups for economic, political or religious purposes. [...] Additionally, it guarantees an individual's right to petition the government for a redress of grievances.|$|E
2500|$|The council {{begins by}} the {{presiding}} officer stating the reported misconduct and asking the accused person to admit or deny it. If the person denies the misconduct, the presiding officer or a designate presents {{the evidence of}} the misconduct. Evidence may be presented in the form of written or oral statements by witnesses or other documents. An accused person's previous confession cannot be used as evidence in a disciplinary council without the member's consent. The accused member is given a chance to question the witnesses against him or her. After the evidence against the accused is presented, the accused is permitted to present evidence in response. The accused can comment on the evidence and make any other statement <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> to make. All witnesses and the accused may also be questioned by any member of the disciplinary council. No witness is placed under oath. Because the disciplinary council is an ecclesiastical court, rules of evidence that govern domestic courts do not apply. The church has instructed leaders that [...] "procedures in a disciplinary council must be fair and considerate of the feelings of all who participate." ...|$|E

For instance--and I assure you I have thought over this matter in all its details--if any of us were inclined to swear or behave disorderly, which I am sure could not be the case, he or she would not do so because he or she would feel that, being responsible to himself or herself, that responsibility would prevent him or her from doing that which would interfere with the pleasure or comfort of his or her associates." ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{contestant}} {{was hooked}} to a giant [...] "skill crane" [...] {{and given the}} appropriate oversized grabbers, with which he had to retrieve large teddy bears while being raised and lowered by his partner. Each bear represented a money amount or a prize, and the contestant could retrieve as many or as few of the bears as <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted.</b> However, one bear had a human inside of it, and attempting to grab this bear would [...] "scare" [...] it, the bear would run away, and the couple received nothing.|$|R

5000|$|Basava {{advocated}} {{that every}} human being was equal, irrespective of caste, and that all forms of manual labor was equally important. Michael states that it wasn't birth but behavior that determined a true saint and Shaiva bhakta {{in the view of}} Basava and Sharanas community. This, writes Michael, was also the position of south Indian Brahmins, that it was [...] "behavior, not birth" [...] that determines the true Brahmin. One difference between the two was that Sharanas welcomed anyone, whatever occupation <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> might have been born in, to convert and be reborn into the larger family of Shiva devotees and then adopt any occupation <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted.</b>|$|R
60|$|As our own {{instincts}} are not appealed to by her conclusion, {{let us see}} whether we cannot discover some reason in it. When Higgins excused his indifference to young women {{on the ground that}} they had an irresistible rival in his mother, he gave the clue to his inveterate old-bachelordom. The case is uncommon {{only to the extent that}} remarkable mothers are uncommon. If an imaginative boy has a sufficiently rich mother who has intelligence, personal grace, dignity of character without harshness, and a cultivated sense of the best art of her time to enable her to make her house beautiful, she sets a standard for him against which very few women can struggle, besides effecting for him a disengagement of his affections, his sense of beauty, and his idealism from his specifically sexual impulses. This makes him a standing puzzle to the huge number of uncultivated people who have been brought up in tasteless homes by commonplace or disagreeable parents, and to whom, consequently, literature, painting, sculpture, music, and affectionate personal relations come as modes of sex if they come at all. The word passion means nothing else to them; and that Higgins could have a passion for phonetics and idealize his mother instead of Eliza, would seem to them absurd and unnatural. Nevertheless, when we look round and see that hardly anyone is too ugly or disagreeable to find a wife or a husband if <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> one, whilst many old maids and bachelors are above the average in quality and culture, we cannot help suspecting that the disentanglement of sex from the associations with which it is so commonly confused, a disentanglement which persons of genius achieve by sheer intellectual analysis, is sometimes produced or aided by parental fascination.|$|E

5000|$|Coach - a rescuer {{should be}} {{encouraged}} to ask questions that are intended to help the individual to make informed choices. The key difference between a rescuer and a coach is that the coach sees the creator as capable of making choices and of solving his or her own problems. A coach asks questions that enable the creator to see the possibilities for positive action, and to focus on what <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> does <b>want</b> instead of what <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> does not <b>want.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Open House" [...] round {{was played}} in early episodes of the {{original}} version, usually about halfway through a particular episode. Five prizes were presented to the contestants and each could buy {{as many of them}} as <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted.</b> Unlike Instant Bargains, multiple contestants could buy the same item. This was later replaced with an [...] "Audience Sale" [...] round in which three members of the studio audience guessed the [...] "sale price" [...] of an item. The one that bid closest without going over won the item. The three contestants could increase their score by correctly guessing which, if any, audience member would win.|$|R
30|$|Swatches {{cut from}} pieces of cloth mounted in pattern books or on pattern cards {{provided}} {{a point of}} contact between the manufacturer and the distant buyer who used them to select the fabrics <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> to buy. Organised in numerical sequence, the swatches were essential management tools for the communication of orders. Manufacturers saw such books ‘… {{not only as a}} history of their trade, but as a resource for communicating complex technical information quickly and efficiently. Nothing could supplant the effectiveness of a sample textile to communicate information about a pattern, colour, texture and finish’ [2]. As exporters of vast quantities of stuffs, Norwich’s manufacturers relied heavily on pattern books and pattern cards in their transactions with foreign and London customers.|$|R

Some {{of these}} switches were one for one (Mike Peters trading with Lynn Johnston, Scott Adams with Bil Keane, Jeff MacNelly with Mort Walker, etc.), while several comics did a multiple swap (including a thirteen-way swap). Also, one artist (Kevin Fagan) just swapped hands for the day, while the writer & artist for Sally Forth swapped roles for the day. Charles M. Schulz (creator of Peanuts) and Patrick McDonnell (creator of Mutts) were slated to do each other's strips, but backed out {{because one of}} them didn't {{think it was a}} good idea.

5000|$|Items {{needed to}} {{complete}} quests would automatically {{be given to}} the player at a certain rate after the monster was defeated by any member of the party. All other items were distributed to different party members by a [...] "dice" [...] system. When an item was picked up by any party member, each member of the party rolls their own set of dice; the player with the highest number won the item. The size of the inventory could be increased, which could be acquired by purchasing with Cash or through some Events. To encourage group play, there was a slight experience boost when working together.
