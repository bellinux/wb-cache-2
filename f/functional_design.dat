5|$|In 1953 Tange and the {{architectural}} journalist and critic Noboru Kawazoe {{were invited to}} attend {{the reconstruction of the}} Ise Shrine. The shrine has been reconstructed every 20years and in 1953 it was the 59th iteration. Normally the reconstruction process was a very closed affair but this time the ceremony was opened to architects and journalists to document the event. The ceremony coincided {{with the end of the}} American Occupation and it seemed to symbolise a new start in Japanese architecture. In 1965 when Tange and Kawazoe published the book Ise: Prototype of Japanese Architecture, he likened the building to a modernist structure: an honest expression of materials, a <b>functional</b> <b>design</b> and prefabricated elements.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{domestic}} architecture {{had continued}} to develop, with the Normans, having first occupied the older Anglo-Saxon dwellings, rapidly beginning to build larger buildings in stone and timber. The elite preferred houses with large, ground-floor halls but the less wealthy constructed simpler houses with the halls on the first floor; master and servants frequently {{lived in the same}} spaces. Wealthier town-houses were also built using stone, and incorporated business and domestic arrangements into a single <b>functional</b> <b>design.</b> By the 14th century grander houses and castles were sophisticated affairs: expensively tiled, often featuring murals and glass windows, these buildings were often designed as a set of apartments to allow greater privacy. Fashionable brick began to be used {{in some parts of the}} country, copying French tastes. Architecture that emulated the older defensive designs remained popular. Less is known about the houses of peasants during this period, although many peasants appear to have lived in relatively substantial, timber-framed long-houses; the quality of these houses improved in the prosperous years following the Black Death, often being built by professional craftsmen.|$|E

25|$|The Alumni Pool (Building 57) was {{designed}} by Lawrence B. Anderson (MArch 1930) and Herbert L. Beckwith (BArch 1926, MArch 1927). The building {{was one of the}} first significant examples of modernist, International Style design in the United States by a US trained architect. In 2000, during the building of the adjoining Stata Center, the building was restored and most of the elegant modernist detailing was replaced by clumsy updates. The sophisticated color palette of the interior floor and walls disappeared. Its walled-in garden to the south was removed altogether and replaced by a more open landscaping. Nonetheless, the building still retains much of its early modernist sensibility, unornamented surfaces and simple <b>functional</b> <b>design.</b>|$|E

25|$|Following the Khrushchev Thaw of {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, {{censorship}} was diminished. During this time, a distinctive period of Soviet culture developed characterized by conformist public life and intense focus on personal life. Greater experimentation in art forms were again permissible, {{with the result that}} more sophisticated and subtly critical work began to be produced. The regime loosened its emphasis on socialist realism; thus, for instance, many protagonists of the novels of author Yury Trifonov concerned themselves with problems of daily life rather than with building socialism. An underground dissident literature, known as samizdat, developed during this late period. In architecture the Khrushchev era mostly focused on <b>functional</b> <b>design</b> as opposed to the highly decorated style of Stalin's epoch.|$|E
25|$|The Normans {{brought with}} them {{architectural}} styles from their own duchy, where austere stone churches were preferred. Under the early Norman kings this style was adapted to produce large, plain cathedrals with ribbed vaulting. During the twelfth century the Anglo-Norman style became richer and more ornate, with pointed arches derived from French architecture replacing the curved Romanesque designs; this style is termed Early English Gothic and continued, with variation, {{throughout the rest of}} the Middle Ages. In domestic architecture, the Normans, having first occupied the older Anglo-Saxon dwellings, rapidly beginning to build larger buildings in stone and timber. The elite preferred houses with large, ground-floor halls but the less wealthy constructed simpler houses with the halls on the first floor; master and servants frequently lived in the same spaces.

In 1903, during the construction of the bridge, the LCC consulted with architect William Edward Riley regarding possible decorative elements that could be added to the bridge. Riley proposed erecting two [...] pylons topped with statues {{at one end of the}} bridge, and adding decorative sculpture to the bridge piers. The pylons were rejected on grounds of cost, but following further consultation with leading architect Richard Norman Shaw it was decided to erect monumental bronze statues above the piers, and Alfred Drury, George Frampton and Frederick Pomeroy were appointed to design appropriate statues.|$|E

500|$|The PCMR's {{power to}} review and block the passage of Bills is {{regarded}} by some {{as an indication of}} its potential as a second chamber. The Council's <b>functional</b> <b>design,</b> however, makes it only a very weak legislative review mechanism. The Council has no power to investigate alleged breaches of minority rights. The general public has also no right of making their views or complaints known to the Chamber. In addition, the lack of a veto power means that currently the most the Council can do is delay the passage of bills and prompt further parliamentary deliberation of the bills in question. But it has yet to do even this much. On those occasions where the Council might have rightly drawn attention to differentiating measures in proposed Bills, the legislature has pre-empted this by inserting [...] "notwithstanding clauses" [...] in the Constitution. Such clauses declare that laws that contravene a constitutional provision are nevertheless valid.|$|E

500|$|A boom in new {{construction}} after 1926 created stiff competition for older buildings like the Monadnock. Occupancy declined from 87percent in 1929 to 55percent in 1937 {{and the building}} began to lose money. In 1938, building manager Graham Aldis (Owen's nephew) announced what the Chicago Daily Tribune called [...] "the city's largest and most novel modernization job" [...] in a move toward halting the destruction of Chicago's aging skyscrapers. Rejecting the term [...] "modernization", Aldis called his plan [...] "progressive styling", which he believed would revolutionize the way building maintenance was done to preserve {{millions of dollars worth}} of buildings that would otherwise be destroyed. [...] "There is no reason why", he said, [...] "any well-designed office building need be torn down because of obsolescence." [...] Skidmore & Owings, who had pioneered <b>functional</b> <b>design,</b> were retained to lead a $125,000 program ($ in [...] dollars) to restyle the main entrance, remodel the lobby and ground floor shops, modernize all the public spaces, and progressively modernize office suites as demand required. The modernization included covering the mosaic floors with rubber tile and terrazzo, enclosing the elevators and ornamental stairways, and replacing the marble and oak finishes in the corridors and offices with modern materials. By the end of 1938, 35 new tenants had signed leases and 11 existing tenants had leased additional space in the building.|$|E
