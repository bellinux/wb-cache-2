40|$|Decreasing {{the number}} of materialised {{securities}} {{for the benefit of}} electronic securities has led to distinctions between commercial and legal opinions on securities transactions. Contemporary financial markets only trade electronic securities held in securities accounts. Securities law enhances adjustments to <b>economic</b> <b>realities</b> <b>and</b> not to legal principles. Discrepancies between <b>economic</b> <b>realities</b> <b>and</b> securities regulation should be resolved in order to find a balance between successfully functioning transactions of electronic securities and legal schemes which are based on transfers of physically existing assets, which include securities, {{as a result of the}} theory of incorporations, in certain legal regulations. This article is a theoretical and legal reflection on selected issues connected with the transfer of securities with reference to discrepancies between <b>economic</b> <b>realities</b> <b>and</b> legal regulations...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is twofold. First, it explores the {{formation}} of economic perceptions in post-communist Europe. Second, it investigates the mechanism of economic voting in that region during the early transition years. Using both micro- and macro-level data from 11 newly established democracies in East Central Europe, the author finds that national economic perceptions were disconnected from the objective <b>economic</b> <b>reality,</b> <b>and</b> mostly driven by personal economic evaluations and political attitudes. In addition, the empirical findings suggest that economic voting in the wake of the transition was both retrospective and prospective...|$|R
50|$|Many {{businesses}} {{found that}} their insurers withdrew trade credit insurance during the late-2000s financial crisis, foreseeing large losses if they continued to underwrite sales to failing businesses. This led to accusations that the insurers were deepening and prolonging the recession, as businesses could not afford the risk of making sales without the insurance, and therefore contracted in size or had to close. Insurers countered these criticisms by claiming {{that they were not}} the cause of the crisis, but were responding to <b>economic</b> <b>reality</b> <b>and</b> ringing the alarm bells.|$|R

In light of these changes in the political <b>economic</b> <b>realities,</b> political economists have shifted their focus over time, first taking labor out of the equation, then bringing the state back in only to devalue it in light of globalization and Europeanization before putting the firm front and center.

Initially, the NLRB rejected all private university employees including academic employees from being protected by the NLRA. In the Trustees of Columbia (1951) decision, the NLRB held that the act did not have jurisdiction in private universities because universities focus primarily on education and are not associated with significant commercial activity. However, two decades later in Cornell v NLRB (1970), the NLRB reversed Columbia, holding that due to changing <b>economic</b> <b>realities</b> <b>and</b> difficulties in distinguishing between commercial and noncommercial activities in private universities, the NLRA covers employees in private education institutions.|$|R
