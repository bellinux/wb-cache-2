The ECB specifies {{the amount of}} liquidity it wishes to auction (called the allotted amount) and asks banks for expressions of interest. In a fixed rate tender the ECB also specifies the interest rate at which <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> lend money; alternatively, in a variable rate tender the interest rate is not specified and banks bid against each other (subject to a minimum bid rate specified by the ECB) to access the available liquidity.|$|E
500|$|Ownership of the {{decommissioned}} boats {{passed on}} to Montenegro after the country declared independence in 2006, ending the state of Serbia and Montenegro and its joint armed forces. In 2009 the Ministry of Defence announced that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> donate three Una-class submarines to former SFR Yugoslav republics of Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia. Although the [...] "Submariner" [...] society from Pula was interested in accepting the donation and exhibiting it in a museum, the Croatian MoD responded with a statement that accepting the donation is against national interests; {{since most of the}} fleet of the former Yugoslav Navy was relocated to Montenegro {{at the beginning of the}} Croatian War of Independence, Croatia claims the military equipment of the former joint armed forces was stolen, and should be a subject of succession. The MoD further explains that the state interest is in compensation for that equipment, not returning [...] "obsolete, damaged and corroded equipment which nowadays Serbia and Montenegro are unsuccessfully trying to sell".|$|E
500|$|Political {{scientist}} Joseph Nye {{commented that}} [...] "while the Riga summit relaxed {{some of these}} caveats to allow assistance to allies in dire circumstances, Britain, Canada, the Netherlands, and the US are {{doing most of the}} fighting in southern Afghanistan, while French, German, and Italian troops are deployed in the quieter north. It is difficult to see how NATO can succeed in stabilizing Afghanistan unless <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> commit more troops and give commanders more flexibility." [...] The controversy surrounding the differences in contributions to Afghanistan indeed remained after the summit. For instance, during March 2007 British commanders accused the NATO members that refused to fight in the conflict-ridden south (in non-emergency situations) as causing [...] "huge resentment" [...] and a sense of betrayal, and undermined the credibility of the alliance. They added that despite the earlier pleas for reinforcements or to have [...] "operational caveats" [...] removed, some countries, notably France and Germany, were still not heeding their requests.|$|E

500|$|Emily Berman, {{counsel at}} the Brennan Center for Justice at the NYU School of Law commented that [...] "' {{potential}} consequences are as predictable as night following day: Police will interrogate criminal suspects {{who do not}} explicitly invoke their rights—often, those will be suspects who are unsophisticated, poorly educated or mentally ill—for hours on end. This will lead, just as inevitably, to more coerced—and therefore unreliable—confessions... the very phenomenon that Miranda aimed to eliminate." [...] She noted the attorney general's comment that Miranda warnings had not deterred terrorism suspects such as Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab and Faisal Shahzad from talking and providing [...] "valuable intelligence". The positive observation was a reflection upon attempts by Congress to amend Miranda legislatively, that the decision [...] "sends a strong signal" [...] that [...] "the Supreme Court is not shy about curtailing Miranda protections, even without prodding from Congress". She concluded that [...] "hile it might look with hostility on congressional attempts {{to rein in the}} scope of the Miranda rule, the Supreme Court itself is willing to interpret narrowly the protections that Miranda affords criminal defendants. And <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> reach relatively far to do so." ...|$|E

2500|$|Moreover, former Argentine {{football}} player Diego Maradona {{was critical of}} FIFA {{in light of the}} corruption scandal, comparing members of the board to dinosaurs. He said [...] "Fifa is a big museum. They are dinosaurs who do not want to relinquish power. It's always going to be the same." [...] In October 2011, Dick Pound criticized the organization, saying, [...] "FIFA has fallen far short of a credible demonstration that it recognizes the many problems it faces, that it has the will to solve them, that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> be transparent about what it is doing and what it finds, and that its conduct in the future will be such that the public can be confident in the governance of the sport." ...|$|E

2500|$|Steven F. Huefner {{wrote that}} [...] "Although the Presentment Clause {{analysis}} of the Line Item Veto Act has superficial appeal, it ultimately does not withstand scrutiny," [...] arguing that the Court should have relied on the nondelegation doctrine in order to invalidate the Act, as it provided a superior basis for such a decision. Huefner named two main implications of the Court’s refusal to use the nondelegation doctrine. First, it suggests that the Court seems unready or unwilling to alter the existing interpretation of the nondelegation doctrine. Second, the Court has shown that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> rely upon alternative rationales {{to achieve the same}} result [...] "as would a more robust nondelegation doctrine rationale". This approach is significant because in theory, such a rationale could endanger previously accepted delegations to the executive.|$|E
2500|$|In the 2025 and 2030 {{long range}} {{transportation}} plans, Tri-Rail has envisioned moving to or adding {{service on the}} Florida East Coast Railway (FEC) corridor, which runs parallel to U.S. 1 (Biscayne Boulevard/Brickell Avenue) in Miami-Dade County, and Federal Highway in Broward and Palm Beach counties). This corridor will provide more opportunities for pedestrian travel from stations to end destinations than does the current South Florida Rail Corridor, which must rely almost exclusively on shuttle buses for passenger distribution. Tri-Rail officials project that the project would cost about $2.5billion and that 59,000 people per day would ride it, The FEC, which denied the state's request to use the line for commuter rail in the 1980s, under new ownership has now stated that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> allow {{the use of the}} [...] segment of track between downtown Miami and Jupiter for passenger trains.|$|E
2500|$|McCarthy {{declared}} his candidacy on November 30, 1967, saying, [...] "I am {{concerned that the}} Administration seems to have set no limit to the price <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay for a military victory." [...] Political experts {{and the news media}} dismissed his candidacy, and he was given little chance of making any impact against Johnson in the primaries. But public perception of him changed following the Tet Offensive (January 30-February 23, 1968), the aftermath of which saw many Democrats grow disillusioned with the war, and quite a few interested in an alternative to LBJ. McCarthy said, [...] "My decision to challenge the President's position and the administration's position has been strengthened by recent announcements out of the administration. The evident intention to escalate and to intensify the war in Vietnam, and on the other hand, the absence of any positive indication or suggestion for a compromise or for a negotiated political settlement." ...|$|E

6000|$|... (3.) The {{strength}} of this desire shows itself in this also, namely, in that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> grapple with the king of terrors, rather than to be detained from that sweet communion that the soul looks for when it comes into the place where its Lord is. Death {{is not to be}} desired for itself; the apostle chose rather to be clothed upon with his house which is from heaven, 'that mortality might be swallowed up of life' (2 Cor 5:1-4). But yet, rather than he would be absent from the Lord, he was willing to be absent from the body. Death, in the very thoughts of it, is grievous to flesh and blood; and nothing can so master it in our apprehensions as that by which we attain to these desires. These desires do deal with death, as Jacob's love to Rachel did deal with the seven long years which he was to serve for her. It made them seem few, or but a little time; now so, I say, doth these desires deal with death itself. They make it seem little, nay, a servant, nay, a privilege; for that, by that a man may come to enjoy the presence of his beloved Lord. 'I have a desire to depart,' to go from the world and relations, to go from my body, that great piece of myself; I have a desire to venture the tugs and pains, and the harsh handling of the king of terrors, so I may be with Jesus Christ! These are desires of the righteous.|$|E
