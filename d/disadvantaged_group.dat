On the other hand, if the overprediction of the minority group's criterion performance is not too extreme, it may seem reasonable to many to leave it uncorrected, thereby giving the benefit of the slight predictive bias to the presumably <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>group.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{flowering}} of indigenous art has delivered economic, {{social and cultural}} benefits to indigenous Australians, who are socially and economically disadvantaged compared to the Australian community as a whole. The sale of art works is a significant economic activity for individual artists and for their communities. Estimates {{of the size of}} the sector vary, but placed its value in the early 2000s at A$100 to 300 million, and by 2007 at half a billion dollars and growing. The sector is particularly important to many indigenous communities because, as well being a source of cash for an economically <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>group,</b> it reinforces indigenous identity and tradition, and has aided the maintenance of social cohesion. For example, early works painted at Papunya were created by senior Aboriginal men to help educate younger generations about their culture and their cultural responsibilities.|$|E

2500|$|Stanford Law Professor Richard Thompson Ford, {{reviewing}} Intellectuals and Race for The American Interest, wrote [...] "Too much of Intellectuals and Race reads ... with overly tendentious and snide {{attacks on}} caricatured liberal theories. This detracts from the fair and often too quickly dismissed points Sowell makes." [...] Thompson says [...] "The {{book is a}} response to the common intuition that inequality between the races must be caused by discrimination or exploitation of the <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>group</b> by the better off, necessitating reparations or corrective intervention in the market economy. [...] Sowell insists instead that differences in productive capabilities explain the differences in outcomes." [...] Thompson writes, [...] "Rather like Booker T. Washington," [...] Sowell argues that today's racial inequalities are the fault of a black culture that encourages the most talented to squander their time and energy mastering esoteric social theories that blame others for their problems, rather than learning the practical skills that will help them solve those problems themselves. He complains that a malcontented 'intelligentsia have demanded an equality of outcome and of social recognition, irrespective of the skills, behavior or performance of the group to which they belong or on whose behalf they spoke.'" [...] Sowell, Thompson finds, [...] "downplays the toll that American racism has taken, not only on black fortunes but on American civic culture and politics." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Government stated that, {{unlike the}} Bail Act 1978, the new act {{is not based}} on a [...] "system of offence-based presumptions". Instead, {{it is based on the}} premise of whether the accused will present as an [...] "unacceptable risk" [...] to society. The new act also allows for a further {{application}} if: the accused previously did not have legal representation, there is new relevant information, relevant circumstances have changed, or the accused is under 18 and the previous application was made on a first appearance for the offence. In May 2013, on the second reading of the Bail Bill, Attorney General and Minister for Justice Greg Smith described the Government's approach as one of [...] "risk-management". [...] The Bail Act 2013 adds an [...] "unacceptable risk" [...] test in regard to whether [...] "the accused will fail to appear in any proceedings for the offence, commit a serious offence, endanger the safety of victims, individuals or the community, or interfere with witnesses or evidence". One significant change is in consideration of [...] "the presumption of innocence and the general right to be at liberty." [...] Another important change is that [...] "once bail is granted, it will continue to operate until it is either revoked or the substantive proceedings concluded." [...] Under the Bail Act 2013, bail does not have to be formally continued by the court. When the bail authority determines that the accused poses an [...] "unacceptable risk", it must record the nature of the presumed risk and consider risk mitigation approaches. To determine whether there is an [...] "unacceptable risk", the bail authority can consider the person's background; the seriousness of the offence; the strength of the case; whether the person has a history of violence or non-compliance with bail requirements, apprehended violence orders, parole or good behaviour bonds; the likely length of the sentence if bail is not granted; and whether the person is of a <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>group.</b> It was noted by a member of the NSW Bar Association that, while they were not [...] "unusual or unfamiliar", not all of the factors the bail authority may consider are directly related to the [...] "unacceptable risk" [...] test.|$|E
