5|$|Roberts' riding {{style in}} which he forced the motorcycle's rear wheel to break {{traction}} to steer around a corner, essentially riding on paved surfaces {{as if they were}} dirt tracks, changed the way Grand Prix motorcycles were ridden. From 1983 to 1999, every 500cc world championship was won by a rider with a dirt track racing background. Roberts' cornering method of hanging off the motorcycles with his knee extended forced him to use duct tape as knee pads, and <b>eventually</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> introduction of purpose-built knee pucks used by all motorcycle road racers today. His battles with the Grand Prix establishment <b>eventually</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> adoption of stricter safety standards for Grand Prix race organizers. He {{was one of the first}} riders to challenge the FIM over the way they treated competitors and helped improve prize money as well as the professionalism of the sport. It was not until Roberts planned his rival race series in 1980 that the FIM was forced to change the way in which they dealt with motorcycle racers.|$|E

All Mesoamerican cultures used Stone Age technology; after c. 1000 AD copper, silver and gold were worked. Mesoamerica lacked draft animals, {{did not use the}} wheel, and possessed few domesticated animals; the principal means of transport was on foot or by canoe.|$|E

5|$|Numerous {{attacks from}} both sides followed, but none were fatal, and the two groups quickly {{realized}} the futility of their attempts to drive the other out. In February 1690, the French began peace negotiations with the Iroquois. The French returned captured natives {{in exchange for the}} beginnings of peace talks. Through the 1690s, there were no major French or native raids and, even against the will of the English, peace talks continued. This time of relative peace <b>eventually</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Montreal Treaty of 1701, by which the Iroquois promised to remain neutral in case of war between the French and English.|$|E
