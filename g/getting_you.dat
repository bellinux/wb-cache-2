500|$|In {{the lyrics}} to the verses, Harrison focuses on the {{benefits}} of Transcendental Meditation rather than detailing the way to achieve these results. While Leng likens Harrison's approach to that of an advertiser selling anti-dandruff shampoo, author Joshua Greene describes the lyrical thrust of the song as: [...] "Is life <b>getting</b> <b>you</b> down? Not getting the breaks you want? Try illumination." [...] Harrison proffers greater awareness and a release from earthly limitations as the other benefits brought about by the meditation experience.|$|E
500|$|Rangel {{is known}} as an energetic, genial, and sociable politician, one {{who is able to}} gain {{friendship}} and influence by means of charm, humor, and candor. [...] He is called [...] "Charlie" [...] by everyone in Congress, from the highest-ranking members to the custodial employees. [...] Of his political skills, 1980s Ways and Means chair Dan Rostenkowski said, [...] "Charlie has the gifted knack of <b>getting</b> <b>you</b> to change your position, and you actually enjoy doing it. Compromising isn't so unusual in Congress. Enjoying it is." [...] The New York congressman's ability to use humor to catch others off guard before making a political point has been called [...] "Rangeling" [...] by lobbyists and others on Capitol Hill. [...] Many of his closest friends and allies in Congress have not been other African Americans, but white representatives from working class or rural districts; O'Neill aide Chris Matthews said these members were [...] "tied emotionally and culturally to the people they represent." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike McKay and Gill, however, Ferguson praised both Davies' {{acting and}} the episode as a whole, deeming it [...] "the best thing on {{television}} all week". He opined that Davies: [...] "plays Creek to easy perfection: mumbling, lugubrious, quietly brilliant", {{and called the}} plot [...] "involving, intriguing, [...] original", stating that it [...] "did the thing all good thrillers, books or films, do of <b>getting</b> <b>you</b> actively, cleverly involved in thinking {{you can see the}} answer before anyone else. You couldn't." [...] The List's Brian Donaldson was also positive about the episode, calling it [...] "surprisingly splendid festive fare", in which [...] "The twists and resolutions were, to this watcher at least, as well hidden as Davies’ ears underneath that shaggy bonce." [...] The Times Tim Teeman deemed the episode [...] "comfort television", commenting on its [...] "rambling pace" [...] and writing that: [...] "Our hero was brainy and cranky and the show itself awkward, funny and idiosyncratic (as you'd expect from the creator, writer and director David Renwick)." [...] The Daily Telegraph Gerard O'Donovan agreed that the episode felt [...] "comfy and familiar", but also found its run-time overstretched, writing that it: ...|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} of the album was positive overall. Robin Denselow of The Guardian awarded the album four of five stars and wrote that Wainwright's performance sounded as [...] "easy-going and spontaneous" [...] and it does at his live concerts. Denselow considered [...] "House" [...] to be the album's best track. The Daily Telegraph Colin Irwin described the album as [...] "oddly uplifting" [...] despite its [...] "variants on the theme that we're all doomed" [...] from the economic crisis. The Observer contributor Neil Spencer wrote that [...] "while [...] tone becomes shrill at times, his mix of nihilism and jauntiness (with ukulele) are finally uplifting." [...] Music journalist Andy Gill of The Independent recommended the tracks [...] "House", [...] "Fear Itself [...] " [...] and [...] "The Panic Is On". Simmy Richman's review for The Independent complimented Wainwright's ability to address current issues [...] "simply and effectively", claiming [...] "Wainwright can make you laugh, nod in agreement, shake your fist in despair and want to sing along". Richman appreciated Wainwright's honesty and humor and wrote that he displayed [...] "better lyrical form than {{he has been in}} for some time". The Independent included 10 Songs on their [...] "Indy Choice: Best of the New Music" [...] list for the week of July 16, 2010. PopMatters' Alex Ramon preferred Wainwright's album Social Studies (1999), but considered 10 Songs to be [...] "an enjoyable effort nonetheless", complimenting it for its simple approach. Furthermore, Ramon wrote that the album [...] "succeeds in <b>getting</b> <b>you</b> smiling rather than despairing at the mess we're in, and that's always been one of Wainwright's great gifts".|$|E

2500|$|The November 1988 {{edition of}} Top magazine, run by Tower Records, {{included}} a review by Simon Young who thought Enya had produced [...] "a fine, peaceful New Age album, which works best when her voice-from-heaven is matched with subtle electronic pools {{of sound and}} layer upon layer of breathy, Clannadesque backing vocals". Jonathan Takiff, for the Philadelphia Daily News, started his review with: [...] "When this old world starts <b>getting</b> <b>you</b> down, just lay on ... Watermark ... and drift away to a blissful state", of which Enya brings a [...] "fusion of old sod balladry and modem technology to another plateau, with a magical, mysterious brew that could be dubbed [...] "New Age Irish" [...] or [...] "Celtic Ambient"". Takiff picked [...] "Orinoco Flow" [...] as the stand out song, and called [...] "River" [...] a [...] "blissful intrumental". He concluded with: [...] "There's nothing uptempo to ever jar the hypnotic ebb and flow. Just lay back and let this music roll all over you." [...] In a review printed in The Boston Globe, Steve Morse wrote about the album highly. He called the record a [...] "series of lush dreamscapes that team the vocal beauty of Irish traditional song with multitracked synthesizer tones", and compared it to works from fellow ambient and new age artists Jean-Michel Jarre, Vangelis and Brian Eno. Its sound, he thought, is [...] "beautiful" [...] and noticed a recurrence of the imagery of water throughout. Morse concluded, [...] "This is an album of atmospheres – true mood music for the soul".|$|E
