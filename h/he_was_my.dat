5|$|On December 15, 2015, Heyward {{signed an}} eight-year, $184 million {{contract}} with the Cubs. One of his first acts after signing his contract was to pay for hotel suites {{large enough to accommodate}} teammate David Ross, his wife, and their three young children on all of the Cubs' road trips during the 2016 season. Ross, set to retire after the 2016 season, had been Heyward's teammate during his first three seasons in Atlanta, and Heyward considered him a key mentor in his early MLB career. In an interview with the Bleacher Report website, Heyward said,I know how special it is to have teammates like <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> first three years in Atlanta. You don't take it for granted. I wanted to say thank you {{from the bottom of my}} heart, as a teammate and as a friend, for what he's done for me.|$|E
5|$|The court enmities {{provoked}} by his twenty years unbroken intimacy and influence with the king, and the denigration of less gifted or less fortunate soldiers, followed him in death. Prince William expressed {{the bitterness of}} his hatred in almost his last words, and Prince Henry's memoirs give a wholly incredible portrait of Winterfeldt's arrogance, dishonesty, immorality and incapacity. Frederick, however, was not apt to encourage incompetence in his most trusted officers, {{and as for the}} rest, Winterfeldt stood first among the very few to whom the king gave his friendship and his entire confidence. On hearing of Winterfeldt's death, he said, I will never ever find again another Winterfeldt,and a little later, He was a good man, a soulful man; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> friend. Winterfeldt's strength was thinking and acting strategically.|$|E

25|$|I invited Joss Whedon {{to lunch}} after I did the {{business}} deal with Fox. We'd had a cool {{relationship in the}} past and I so wanted to do something else, and I wanted to get back into a television show. I had him on the brain for sure but I hadn't called him yet, but I sort of took a leap of faith and set things up with Fox and then called Joss. We went to a four-hour lunch where I just sort of used my womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and I {{was a little bit of}} a wild child.

Among the many things I learned from his music, the concept and experience of color and the form of time will be unforgettable." [...] The composition Rain Tree Sketch II, {{which was to be}} Takemitsu's final piano piece, was also written that year and subtitled [...] "In Memoriam Olivier Messiaen".|$|E

500|$|Larwood {{was first}} called for full county duty on 20 August 1924, against Northamptonshire, at Trent Bridge. He bowled 26 overs in all, conceded 71 runs {{and took the}} wicket of Vallance Jupp, an {{experienced}} Test all-rounder. His assessment of his performance was negative: [...] "I wasn't ready". Iremonger was much more positive, assuring Larwood that his bowling required only fine tuning. Larwood had also gained {{the support of the}} county captain, Arthur Carr, a powerful personality who decided that the new recruit had the makings of a future Test match bowler. [...] "The {{best way to deal with}} him", Carr said later, [...] "was as if <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> own son". Carr played a major part in encouraging and developing the young bowler's talents, and acted as Larwood's guiding spirit throughout the latter's career.|$|E
500|$|Mahmud Bushatli, the Ottoman pasha of Skadar in {{northern}} Albania, was reputed a powerful zduhaÄ‡ in Montenegro. It was claimed {{that his mother}} carried him for three years. Bushatli was defeated and killed by the Montenegrins under Petar I, while attempting to subdue them in 1796. Since that time, the crop yield in Montenegro and northern Albania was allegedly {{not as high as}} before. Bushatli was said to have fought for the crop yield against the transmarine zduhaÄ‡i. Petar I was reported saying of him, [...] "I regret his death although <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> biggest enemy." [...] After Bushatli was killed, his body was burned; according to oral accounts, green flames rose from it. In South Slavic tradition, green could be associated with supernatural creatures, like witches and dragons.|$|E
500|$|Tim's driving days {{started as}} a toddler when {{he was given a}} go-kart that he often drove inside {{buildings}} and across his lawn. He later raced the kart at tracks in Moreland and New Pittsburg. Richmond grew up in a well-to-do family, and was sometimes therefore treated differently by his classmates, so his parents enrolled him in Miami Military Academy in Miami, Florida. During his years in Miami, Tim and his mother moved to Florida and his father stayed in Ohio. While home in Ohio over a summer break, he met local drag racer Raymond Beadle through lifelong friend Fred Miller. When Richmond reached age 16, his parents purchased him a Pontiac Trans Am, a speedboat and a Piper Cherokee airplane for his birthday. Yet his mother Evelyn often worried about spoiling her only son. She once said, [...] "Tim was lazy...", and [...] "... I did everything for him. I ruined him, I admit it. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> whole life." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{included}} a guest appearance from Alexander Siddig, {{who played the}} [...] "Muslim hero" [...] Muhammed Ibhn Khaldun. Siddig was already well known as playing regular character Julian Bashir in [...] The producers viewed Siddig as a [...] "noble" [...] actor when he was playing the character. Siddig described the role as a [...] "godsend" [...] to him, because it enabled him to [...] "portray various aspects of an Arab man who was readily credible. He {{came out of a}} new identity I was looking for, trying to take a snapshot of this guy before he disappears. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> father. He was your father. He was the father of all the generations that had a liberal upbringing and didn't make a lot of money." [...] Roshan Seth played imam Fazul Azzam; he was cast because Brenton wanted him to appear in the episode. Meanwhile, Taahir Husain played the bomber Abu Hassan. The producers felt that the child actor was [...] "a find" [...] for them; it was his first television appearance, but they believed his performance [...] "carried it off." ...|$|E
500|$|Conflict, or Angelou's {{presentation}} of opposites, is another theme in Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas. As Lupton states, Angelou constructs a plot by mixing opposing incidences and attitudes - Angelou's [...] "dialectical method". The book {{is full of}} conflicts: in Angelou's marriage, her feelings between being a good mother and a successful performer, the stereotypes about other races, and her new experiences with whites. Lupton believes this {{presentation of}} conflict is what makes Angelou's writing [...] "brilliant"; she finds that the strength of Singin' and Swingin' [...] comes, in part, from Angelou's duplication of conflicts underlying the plot, characters, and thought patterns in the book. Lupton adds, [...] "Not many other contemporary autobiographers {{have been able to}} capture, either in a single volume or in a series, the opposition of desires that is found in Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas and, to a lesser extent, in Angelou's other volumes". Even the closing sentence of the book ("Although I was not a great singer I was his mother, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> wonderful, dependently independent son") demonstrates Angelou's dialectical construction, sums up the contradictions of Angelou's character, and alludes to mother/son patterns in her later books.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{invasion}} of Crete in May 1941, the 2/7th Battalion was initially employed in a coastal defence role, before {{taking part in the}} fighting around Canea. After this, it took part in a devastating bayonet charge at 42nd Street, along with the New Zealand Maori Battalion, which killed almost 300 Germans and briefly checked their advance. It was during this battle that Saunders killed his first opponent: [...] "...I saw a German soldier stand up in clear view about thirty yards [...] away. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> first sure kill... I can remember for a moment that it was just like shooting a kangaroo... just as remote." [...] As the Allies began to evacuate the island, the 2/7th was called upon to carry out a series of rearguard actions in order to allow other units to be taken off the island. After the final Allied ships departed the island on 1June 1941, the battalion was left behind. As a result, many of its men were taken prisoner, though some were able to evade capture by hiding out in the hills and caves around the island. Adopting Cretan dress, learning the dialect, and enlisting the help of local inhabitants, Saunders managed to remain hidden for eleven months.|$|E
