40|$|Sudden, {{short-term}} disruptions seriously endangering {{energy security}} can {{be triggered by}} a variety of events ¿ among them attacks by terrorists. This study investigates terrorist attack practices against <b>energy</b> <b>infrastructures</b> and discusses how we may understand them. Our results indicate that attacks against <b>energy</b> <b>infrastructures</b> are comparatively few. Also, we find no strong connection between the ideologies of various terrorist groups and their proclivity to attack. In addition, the highly disproportionate number of attacks in a handful of countries highlights the strong geographic concentration of attacks. To explain these findings, we analyze terrorist targeting incentives including intimidation levels, symbolism, attack feasibility, and concerns for stakeholders. We argue that terrorists in general have comparatively few incentives to attack <b>energy</b> supply <b>infrastructures</b> based on our assessment of these factors. Moreover, higher levels of terrorist incidents in states more prone to internal violent conflict may suggest stronger incentives to attack <b>energy</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> When outlining <b>energy</b> security policies, the low frequency of world wide attacks coupled with the high concentration of attacks in certain unstable countries should be taken in to consideration. Energy importing countries could benefit from developing strategies to increase stability in key energy supply and / or transit countries facing risks of internal instability. JRC. DDG.

40|$|<b>Energy</b> <b>infrastructures</b> in {{the future}} urban areas need to manage various {{profiles}} of energy demand and supply required within the area through the year, also allowing long-term flexibility for utilizing new energy systems. To improve overall efficiency of energy use in the urban areas, satisfying the above requirements, underground space utilization for the urban <b>energy</b> <b>infrastructures</b> that enable a flexible network of distributed-type facilities {{could be one of}} appropriate options. In order to realize this underground network concept, a network planning approach to evaluate proper energy balance is essential. Also, categorizing and classifying transferred items and depth of underground space to be utilized will be valuable in establishing a set of data on the first tentative plan of the network. The discussed network routes covering a 700 km length as a total, consists of a combination of a circulation-shaped network and a radiation-shaped network, assuming a typical urban area as the base for the study. This paper concludes that an appropriate planning with long-term flexibility for new energy systems enables the underground <b>energy</b> <b>infrastructures</b> that improve the energy efficiency and the environmental conditions in the urban areas...|$|R

The similarity of both concepts is a pathway of two actions: 1) reduce energy demand by means of energy efficiency measures and passive energy use; 2) generate energy from renewable sources. However, the Net ZEBs grid interaction and plans to widely increase their numbers evoke considerations on increased flexibility in the shift of energy loads and reduced peak demands.|$|E

40|$|The {{notion of}} {{transition}} receives noticeable attention in political {{as well as}} scientific arenas. In the policy arena in the Netherlands, significant results have not been achieved yet despite all the efforts on ‘managing’ the transition to a sustainable energy sector. Although the scientific literature on transitions contains publications from 25 countries, the US was most important before 2000 and authors from the Netherlands have been dominant since. Simulations of energy transitions are in its early stages, compared to their potential. Our bibliographical analysis of the transition literature shows that the number of papers mentioning simulations is low, only 19 out of 142, and their young. Most of those papers describe case studies that focus on autonomous, unmanaged transitions; only a few aim their simulations at transition management. Complex systems theory tells us that <b>energy</b> <b>infrastructures</b> – true socio-technical systems – cannot be designed. Therefore, transition management is a paradox: when transitions are expected to take decades, how could we know what actions to take now in order to shape <b>energy</b> <b>infrastructures</b> {{in such a way that}} the preferred transition will occur over decades? And at the end of the day, how could we attribute the result to transition management activities, whether the transition was successful or not? This paradox is no argument to wait: policy issues regarding <b>energy</b> <b>infrastructures</b> have to be made today. Therefore, we have set out for simulations of energy transition, using agent-based models, as to support energy transition management. Results from three cases – regarding CO 2 reduction from power generation, the electricity-intensity of consumer lighting, and a spot market for LNG trade – have proved that it is possible to gain useful insights in how the myriad of decisions made in <b>energy</b> <b>infrastructures</b> can be influenced in a way that a transition is likely.
