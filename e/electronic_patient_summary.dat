50|$|A Summary Care Record (SCR) is an <b>electronic</b> <b>patient</b> record, a <b>summary</b> of National Health Service {{patient data}} held on a central {{database}} covering England, {{part of the}} NHS National Programme for IT. The purpose of the database is to make patient data readily available anywhere that the patient seeks treatment, for example if they are staying away from their home town or if {{they are unable to}} give information for themselves. Despite opposition from some quarters, by September 2010, 424 GP practices across at least 36 Primary Care Trusts had uploaded 2.7 million Summary Care Records. On 10 October 2010, the Health Secretary announced that the coalition government would continue with the introduction, but that the records would 'hold only the essential medical information needed in an emergency - that is medication, allergen and drug reactions'. By March 2013, more than 24 million SCRs had been created across England.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Hospital {{discharge}} is {{a transition}} of care, where medication discrepancies {{are likely to}} occur and potentially cause patient harm. The purpose of our study {{was to assess the}} prescribing accuracy of hospital discharge medication orders at a London, UK teaching hospital. The timeliness of the discharge summary reaching the general practitioner (GP, family physician) was also assessed based on the 72 h target referenced in the Care Quality Commission report. 1 Method: 501 consecutive discharge medication orders from 142 patients were examined and the following records were compared (1) the final inpatient drug chart at the point of discharge, (2) printed signed copy of the initial to take away (TTA) discharge summary produced electronically by the physician, (3) the pharmacist's amendments on the initial TTA that were hand written, (4) the final <b>electronic</b> <b>patient</b> discharge <b>summary</b> record, (5) the patients final take home medication from the hospital. Discrepancies between the physician's order (6) and pharmacist's change(s) (7) were compared with two types of failures – ‘failure to make a required change’ and ‘change where none was required’. Once the patient was discharged, the patient's GP, was contacted 72 h after discharge to see if the <b>patient</b> discharge <b>summary,</b> sent by post or via email, was received. Results: Over half the patients seen (73 out of 142) patients had at least one discrepancy that was made on the initial TTA by the doctor and amended by the pharmacist. Out of the 501 drugs, there were 140 discrepancies, 108 were ‘failures to make a required change’ (77 %) and 32 were ‘changes where none were required’ (23 %). The types of ‘failures to make required changes’ discrepancies that were found between the initial TTA and pharmacist's amendments were paracetamol and ibuprofen changes (dose banding) 38 (27 %), directions of use 34 (24 %), incorrect formulation of medication 28 (20 %) and incorrect strength 8 (6 %). The types of ‘changes where none were required discrepancies’ were omitted medication 15 (11 %), unnecessary drug 14 (10 %) and incorrect medicine including spelling mistakes 3 (2 %). After contacting the GPs of the discharged patients 72 h postdischarge; 49 % had received the discharge summary and 45 % had not, the remaining 6 % were patients who were discharged without a GP. Conclusion: This study shows that doctor prescribing at discharge is often not accurate, and interventions made by pharmacist to reconcile are important at this point of care. It was also found that half the discharge summaries had not reached the patient's family physician (according to the GP) within 72 h...|$|R

40|$|Problem: The Smart Open Services for European Patients (epSOS) the {{exchange}} of <b>electronic</b> <b>Patient</b> <b>Summaries</b> and ePrescriptions between selected member states of the European Union (EU). This project basically solved the ‘communication’ or message transfer problem. However, it encountered a serious ‘delivery’ problem: the safe dispensation of a medicinal product noted in a prescription from a given country by a retail pharmacist in another country. The reason for this was that the specified medicine could in many instances not univocally be identified – the same name may identify a product with a different active ingredient, or the product with identical composition may carry a different name in the other country. If the prescribed medicine had not been authorised for marketing in the other country, information on its attributes may not be available. This rendered dispensation by the pharmacist impossible, even where substitution would, in principle, be allowed and possible. Objectives: This paper reports on the goal, activities and achievements of the openMedicine project towards development of a digital solution and its implementation to meet this identification and the resulting delivery challenge. European-wide and cross-Atlantic endeavours to enhance pharmacovigilance {{by being able to}} match adverse event reports filed under different drug names which provide, however, for the same active ingredient(s) were developed upon. And the need for and benefits of being able to trace for clinical purposes, e. g. the longer-term treatment with the same active ingredient, even when the name of the prescribed medicine changed several times, were explored. Methodological approach: The openMedicine project was funded by the European Commission (EC) on behalf of member states to analyse this European-wide problem. Work benefitted from the epSOS project and work by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the USA Federal Drug Agency (FDA), and standard development organisations (SDOs). Reviews of white and grey literature, reports, regulatory documents, standards and other documents were undertaken. An online survey of 160 experts in all EU member states contributed empirical evidence. Work gained from discussions within an Expert Council representing core players and stakeholders in Europe and North America, and regional workshops across the EU and at the FDA. They also contributed towards validation of results. Results: The fragmentation of national markets for medicinal products lies {{at the root of the}} identification problem. About 600, 000 different products are marketed across the Union, but even in a large country like Germany only ca. 50, 000 are readily available. The great flexibility of marketing authorisation holders to provide different names for the same or equivalent products in different countries adds to this identification challenge, and naming issues related to legacy products complicate it further. – Options to identify medicinal products in a prescription are analysed, like noting a package code, the brand name of the product, the specification of an active substance only, or of a subset of similar products, from which the pharmacist has to choose. The EU-wide adoption of the International Standards Organisation’s (ISO) Identification of Medicinal Products (IDMP) suite of standards, as already under way by EMA and FDA for pharmacovigilance purposes, is proposed. Through globally agreed coding of packages, medicinal as well as pharmaceutical products, substances, dose forms, and other identifying attributes as needed, the identification as well as partly the ‘delivery’ problem can be solved. This will require linking to a central data base maintained by EMA, and the synchronisation of national as well as commercial medicinal and pharmaceutical product data bases with it. The full solution of the delivery problem will, however, also depend on the introduction – in countries where this is not yet allowed – and the relaxation respectively harmonisation of national substitution rules. Of course, if no equivalent product is available, delivery will fail – or require import from another country. Conclusions: Implementing digital infrastructures facilitating the univocal identification of medicinal products in regulatory and clinical contexts will generate long-term benefits for patient safety, pharmacovigilance, and positive socio-economic impacts for all key players. Harmonising the identification of medicines in regulatory processes as well as clinical documents is well on its way, but a European approach towards common processes for validation of contents, error mitigation, of linking from central hubs to national and regional levels, updates and mappings to other systems will require intensified cooperation of all stakeholders in years to come...|$|R

All physical therapists use computers in practice, because they are required to register quality and performance indicators for financial reasons. Physical therapists demonstrate a positive attitude towards <b>Electronic</b> <b>Patient</b> Records, because of the potential to share patient data. However, they consider reporting in the EPR time consuming, and often irrelevant for providing good care.

40|$|Context High-quality cancer {{care should}} be {{accessible}} for patients and healthcare professionals. Involvement of patients as partners in guideline formation and consensus processes is still rarely found. EURECCA, short for European Registration of Cancer Care, is the platform to improve outcomes of cancer care by reducing variation in the diagnostic and treatment process. EURECCA acknowledges {{the important role of}} patients in implementation of consensus information in clinical practice. Objective The aim {{of this article is to}} describe the process of involving patients in the consensus process and in developing the <b>patient</b> <b>summary</b> of the consensus for colon and rectal cancer care. Methods The Delphi method for achieving consensus was used. Three online voting rounds and one tele-voting round were offered to an expert panel of oncology professionals and patient representatives. At four different stages, patients and/or patient representatives were involved in the process: (1) during the consensus process, (2) lecturing about the role of the patient, (3) development of the <b>patient</b> <b>summary,</b> and (4) testing the <b>patient</b> <b>summary.</b> Results Representatives were invited to the voting and commenting rounds of this process and given an equal vote. Although patients were not consulted during the planning stages of this process, patient involvement increased following the panel's discussion of the implementation of the consensus among the patient population. After the consensus meeting, the <b>patient</b> <b>summary</b> was written by patient representatives, oncologists and nurses. A selection of proactive patients reviewed the draft patient summary; responses were positive and several patient-reported outcomes were added. Questionnaires to evaluate the use and implementation of the <b>patient</b> <b>summary</b> in daily practice are currently being developed and tested. Patient consultation will be needed in future planning for selection of topics. Discussion The present study may function as a model for future consensus processes to involve patients at different stages and to implement both patient and healthcare professional versions in daily practice...|$|R
