5|$|The Swiss Ornithological Institute {{has set up}} a {{monitoring}} program to record breeding populations of woodland birds. This has shown that deadwood is an important habitat requirement for the black woodpecker, great spotted woodpecker, middle spotted woodpecker, lesser spotted woodpecker, <b>European</b> <b>green</b> <b>woodpecker</b> and Eurasian three-toed woodpecker. Populations of all these species increased by varying amounts in the period 1990 to 2008. During this period, the amount of deadwood in the forest increased and the range of the white-backed woodpecker enlarged as it extended eastwards. With the exception of the green and middle spotted woodpeckers, the increase in the amount of deadwood {{is likely to be the}} major factor explaining the population increase of these species.|$|E
25|$|Bird species {{include more}} common lapwings, mallards, quails and pheasants. Common {{woodland}} and parkland birds during the nesting season include great tit, blue tit, long-tailed tit, Eurasian nuthatch, <b>European</b> <b>green</b> <b>woodpecker,</b> great spotted woodpecker, golden oriole, nightingale, blackcap, common chaffinch, hooded crow, European magpie, common wood pigeon, feral pigeon, white wagtail and barn swallow.|$|E
25|$|Many {{species of}} animal live on Lüneburg Heath, {{particularly}} birds that are {{at home in the}} wide, open landscape, some of which are seriously threatened by the intensive-farming techniques in other areas. These include the: black grouse (Tetrao tetrix), the nightjar (Caprimulgus europaeus), the woodlark (Lullula arborea), the great grey shrike (Lanius excubitor), the red-backed shrike (Lanius collurio), the northern wheatear (Oenanthe oenanthe), the wryneck (Jynx torquilla), the <b>European</b> <b>green</b> <b>woodpecker</b> (Picus viridis), the stonechat (Saxicola torquata), the Eurasian curlew (Numenius arquata), the common quail (Coturnix coturnix) and the black stork (Ciconia nigra). In the Lüneburg Heath the population of the very rare black grouse is rising continually. In 2007 78 were counted, 13 more than in the previous year. Since 2003 the number of grouse has doubled.|$|E
50|$|Fauna include insects such as dark bush-crickets, {{white admiral}} and ringlet butterflies, and bird {{species such as}} sparrowhawks, tawny owls, great spotted <b>woodpeckers</b> and <b>European</b> <b>green</b> <b>woodpeckers.</b> Songbirds and sparrowhawks are popular sights.|$|R
2500|$|The Northumberland site is {{also home}} to a variety of other species {{including}} red squirrel, fox, and badger, as well as roe deer and fallow deer. [...] There are approximately 55 bird species, including common buzzards, <b>European</b> <b>green</b> <b>woodpeckers,</b> and the Eurasian nuthatch which claims this latitude as its northernmost range in the United Kingdom.|$|R
50|$|There is {{evidence}} for hybridisation between grey-headed and <b>European</b> <b>green</b> <b>woodpeckers.</b> However, these seem extremely rare. It {{appears that the}} female partner was invariably a grey-headed woodpecker. Nothing has been reported concerning the fertility of such hybrid offspring. Their plumage resembles a grey-headed woodpecker more closely, but with a red parting on the head, a reddish nape and a brighter iris, while some were conspicuous for their dark coloration.|$|R
25|$|However, it is {{the forest}} species which are the most notable of the park, {{especially}} the woodpeckers and owls. Concerning woodpeckers, the great spotted woodpecker is the most common, but the black woodpecker, the <b>European</b> <b>green</b> <b>woodpecker</b> and the lesser spotted woodpecker are also themselves common. The population of white-backed woodpecker, a species classified as very endangered in Sweden with only 16 individuals {{in the whole country}} in 2004, has diminished in the park. Of 7 pairs observed in 1976, one sole individual was observed in 2003, and then a new couple in 2010. This species especially likes old forests with lots of dead trees and the species is thus a good indicator of the richness of the forest. In contrast, the grey-headed woodpecker is becoming more common. Regarding owls, the most common species are the Eurasian pygmy owl and the Ural owl. The latter is in addition the symbol of the park. Apart from these species, there are the common buzzard, the Eurasian hobby, or even, among others, the European honey buzzard.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{a useful}} link for both {{pedestrians}} and cyclists from Bybrook and Kennington to the town centre and also beyond {{to the rest of}} the Green Corridor. The banks of the Great Stour here have wide margins of riverside vegetation and in places blocks of mature native trees. There is a small woodland garden at the northern end, where <b>European</b> <b>green</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> can be heard. In the past this land was probably sheep pasture - an 1876 Ordnance Survey map shows sheepfolds on the site.|$|R
50|$|His bird {{paintings}} featured {{an array}} of exotic species such as cockatoos, macaws, and mynas, which were {{likely to have been}} imported to European menageries at the time. He mixed them with familiar European birds such as great and blue tits, <b>European</b> <b>green</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> and Eurasian jays. He would often highlight a painting with a bird of red plumage, such as a scarlet ibis, red avadavat or northern cardinal. Numerous birds were usually crowded into his landscapes; an exception was the highly regarded Two Icelandic Falcons, painted around the end of the 17th century or early 18th. Currently housed in Nottingham Castle Museum and Art Gallery, it depicts two snowy white Gyrfalcons.|$|R
5000|$|Besides these partner-specific vocalisations, {{aggressive}} noises can {{be heard}} from both sexes, but more often the male. Typical are individual, sharp kuek sounds that may, with increasing irritation, be placed in sequence and be continued as kek. A single kuek may be also be a predator warning, as begging nestlings will immediately fall silent if this call is made by either parent. Individual drumming activity by grey-headed woodpeckers can be quite varied, but they drum on more occasions than <b>European</b> <b>green</b> <b>woodpeckers.</b> Drumming frequence can be 20 Hertz, with a [...] "drum roll" [...] lasting up to 40 beats, or two seconds. Both sexes drum, but the female less often than the male, and usually more quietly and shorter. Grey-headed woodpeckers often continue {{to use the same}} well-resonating drum sites for years - these can even be at a considerable distance from the nest. Grey-headed woodpeckers often use metal covers on masts and roofs as drumming substrate due to their favourable resonance characteristics.|$|R
