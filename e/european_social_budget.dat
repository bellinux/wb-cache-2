For {{comparison of the}} methods experimental research and conditions of real assembly production were used. The main goal of the paper is demonstration of reliability, mutual accuracy and deviations of individual methods. A hypothesis needed for verification was stated, that individual methods should have accuracy deviation between 5 % to 10 %. Findings about time demands for analysis when using chosen methods was a partial goal of our research. For mutual comparison MTM- 1 and BasicMOST methods were selected. <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> Fund; state <b>budget</b> of the Czech Republic; [NEXLIZ - CZ. 1. 07 / 2. 3. 00 / 30. 0038]; [CZ. 1. 07 / 2. 4. 00 / 31. 0096...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to analyze}} {{success rate of}} {{integration}} of person returning to the labour market after thein previous imprisonment between years 2008 - 2012. This paper uses data of the prison service of the Czech Republic, projects Šance, Pomůžeme ti pracovat and Nová šance.

40|$|The {{correlation}} between magneto-structural properties of iron oxide nanoparticles and their heating efficiency in ac magnetic fields is investigated. Nanoparticles {{with an average}} size of 13 nm and narrow size distribution are synthesized by coprecipitation of ferrous and ferric salts in an alkaline medium in which the salts ratio is systematically varied. To obtain nanoparticles with single-phase composition, the prepared samples are annealed at 200 °C. The lattice parameters of all nanoparticles deduced from X-ray diffraction analysis correspond to multiphase composition, i. e., to a mixture of magnetite and maghemite phases. However, low-temperature Mossbauer spectroscopy revealed complete transformation of magnetite to maghemite in annealed samples. The annealed samples show slightly higher value of specific loss power at a certain frequency and amplitude of ac magnetic field compared with other samples.

40|$|The aniline-based {{oligomers}} were synthesized by oxidation of aniline with p-benzoquinone in {{the solutions}} of methanesulfonic acid, 2, 5 -dianilino-p- benzoquinone methanesulfonate salt being the main product. The synthesized samples {{were characterized by}} UV-visible and FTIR spectroscopies and compared with polyaniline base. In order to characterize the electrical properties of materials obtained, the conductivity measurements and broadband dielectric spectroscopy were performed. The dependence of DC conductivity on the acid concentration in the reaction medium was strongly non-linear (percolation-like) thus indicating {{a significant difference in}} electrical properties of lowly and highly protonated aniline-based oligomers. This difference is confirmed by dielectric properties exhibiting one common (dipole orientation polarization) and two specific (charge carrier hopping and interfacial polarization) relaxation processes. © 2014 Elsevier B.
