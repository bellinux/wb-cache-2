However, <b>shrimp</b> <b>{{trawlers}}</b> only account for a very small portion of trawlers in Hong Kong. Currently, the most common trawlers in Hong Kong, are the Hang Trawlers, Sten Trawlers, Purse Seniers and Gill-Netters. [...] All of these local fishing boat junks were mechanized only after the Pacific War.|$|R

50|$|With {{technical}} support from NOAA and IFREMER, the CRPMEMG carried out numerous at sea trials in close collaboration with French Guiana fleets. Specific parameters where tested {{such as the}} shape and spacing between {{the bars of the}} selective grid. These trials allowed the fleets and the crews on board the <b>shrimp</b> <b>trawlers</b> to understand the advantages of a more selective fishing gear and the benefits of using it in French Guiana. Based on the results and the captains’ recommendations, the CRPMEMG decided to make the use of this TTED system mandatory by January 2010, when the annual fishing licences are issued. Many Captains were already using the TTED device on their <b>shrimp</b> <b>trawlers</b> well before January 2010.|$|R

Most material was collected from gill net fisheries during 1977 - 1980, but some was taken from <b>shrimp</b> <b>trawlers</b> operating in the same area during 1980 - 1981. Main spawning takes place during October-January with a peak in December. There is also some evidence that spawning takes place during June-July.

Ageing was carried out using primary growth rings in the otoliths and length-frequency analysis of fish caught by <b>shrimp</b> <b>trawlers.</b> Von Bertalanffy's growth equation parameters were determined.

40|$|This {{document}} {{provides an}} explanation on how <b>shrimp</b> <b>trawler</b> owners/operators can analyze {{the effects of}} changing costs and ex-vessel prices on the profitability of operating a <b>shrimp</b> <b>trawler.</b> An Excel spreadsheet is provided with sample boat costs and revenues. The spreadsheet allows the trawler owner/operator to enter costs and revenues data for their own vessel. This {{can be used to}} estimate average costs of landing a pound of shrimp by the vessel owner/operator and the profit (loss) per pound of landed shrimp. As input costs vary for key items like fuel, ice, BRDS, etc, the trawler owner can estimate the impact of these input costs on the total average cost of landing a pound of shrimp. Similarly, as the ex-vessel (landed) price for a pound of shrimp changes, the vessel owner/operator can estimate the impact of these price changes on the profitability of operating the trawler.

The results of the relative yield per recruitment (T/R) of the ten investigated species, their optimum and current lengths at first capture (L c) and their lengths at first maturation (L m) indicate that the stock of these species suffered a problem of recruitment overfishing. A strategy of protection for Northwest Arabian Gulf fisheries involves implementing closed season, introducing an effort limitation policy should be designed...|$|R
