5|$|The reigns of Djedkare Isesi and of Unas were a time {{of changes}} in Ancient Egyptian {{religion}} and in the ideology of kingship, changes that are first demonstrable under Unas. A statistical analysis of clay seal fragments bearing Horus names of pharaohs of the Fifth Dynasty points to a marked decline of {{the cult of the}} king during Unas' time on the throne. This continued under Unas' successor Teti, for whom we <b>know</b> <b>only</b> two seals bearing his Horus name. This trend reflects the lessening of the king's power in conjunction with the growth of the administration and priesthood.|$|E

25|$|As an heroic song {{composed}} or recited by oral bards, {{the epic}} of Gesar has been, for centuries, improvised on, {{and there is}} therefore no canonical or monumental version, as one finds in, for example, Greek epic. A given Gesar singer would <b>know</b> <b>only</b> his local version, which nonetheless would take weeks to recite. It has been responsive to regional culture and folklore, local conflicts, religious trends, and even political changes on the world stage. For example, in modern times, when news of World War II trickled into Tibet, additional episodes on how Gesar Conquers the Kingdom of Phyigling 'Jar were composed by 8th Khamthrül Rinpoche (1929–1980), in which Gesar appears, according to some interpretations, to travel to Germany to vanquish the demon-king, perhaps alluding to Adolf Hitler.|$|E
25|$|Like its predecessor, Do You Know {{achieved}} {{its greatest}} commercial success on Billboard's component charts. Almost topping the Gospel Albums chart, the album peaked at number two, {{where it had}} its longest chart run, staying on the chart for 20 weeks, resulting in its placement at number twenty-five on Billboards Year-End Gospel Albums chart. Meanwhile, the album peaked at number three on Billboards Christian Albums chart, remaining on the chart for six weeks and peaked at number twenty-eight on the Top R/Hip-Hop Albums chart, where it spent {{a total of five}} weeks. However, Do You <b>Know</b> <b>only</b> managed to hold one week on the main US albums chart – the Billboard 200 – where it peaked at a disappointing one-hundred-and-twenty. According to Billboard.com, as of 2008, the album has sold 78,000 copies.|$|E
500|$|According to postwar testimonies, when {{transports}} were temporarily halted, then-deputy commandant Kurt Franz wrote {{lyrics to}} a song meant {{to celebrate the}} Treblinka extermination camp. In reality, prisoner Walter Hirsch wrote them for him. The melody came from something Franz remembered from Buchenwald. The music was upbeat, in the key of D major. The song was taught to Jews assigned {{to work in the}} Sonderkommando. They were forced to memorise it by nightfall of their first day at the camp. Unterscharführer Franz Suchomel recalled the lyrics as follows: [...] "We <b>know</b> <b>only</b> the word of the Commander. / We <b>know</b> <b>only</b> obedience and duty. / We want to keep working, working, / until a bit of luck beckons us some time.

500|$|At {{the time}} the Watergate scandal broke to the media, Nixon [...] "barely noticed" [...] the reports of a {{break-in}} at the Democratic National Committee headquarters. Later, when asked by the press about Watergate, she replied curtly, [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>only</b> what I read in the newspapers." [...] In 1974, when a reporter asked [...] "Is the press {{the cause of the}} president's problems?", she shot back, [...] "What problems?" [...] Privately, she felt that the power of her husband's staff was increasing, and President Nixon was becoming more removed from what was occurring in the administration.|$|E
500|$|At a {{press conference}} on Sept 14 1937, Roosevelt was asked about whether he had {{knowledge}} of Black's involvement with the Ku Klux Klan.

Until such time as he returns there is no further comment to be made.” On Sept 21 1937, FDR was again asked during {{a press conference}} {{about whether or not}} he had communications with Hugo Black regarding his involvement in the Ku Klux Klan. Again, FDR denied speaking with Hugo Black, and when asked about whether the Department of Justice should be [...] "charged automatically" [...] with investigating Supreme Court appointments, FDR said in part, [...] "No, certainly not...a man's private life is supposed to be his private life..." ...|$|E
500|$|It {{is likely}} that the {{composition}} and style of John Everett Millais's controversial The Knight Errant was influenced by Musidora, but other than Millais, and Etty's admirer and imitator William Edward Frost, few other artists were directly influenced by Etty's work. In 1882 Vanity Fair commented on Musidora that [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>only</b> too well how the rough and his female companion behave in front of pictures such as Etty's bather. I have seen the gangs of workmen strolling round, and I know that their artistic interest in studies of the nude is emphatically embarrassing." [...] By the early 20th century Victorian styles of art and literature fell dramatically out of fashion in Britain, and by 1915 the word [...] "Victorian" [...] had become a derogatory term. Frederick Mentone's The Human Form in Art (1944) {{was one of the few}} 20th-century academic works to favourably view Musidora.|$|E

500|$|Shortly after Candaules was {{exhibited}} Etty, needled by repeated {{attacks from}} the press on his supposed tastelessness, indecency and lack of creativity, decided to produce an explicitly moral piece. The result was his 1832 The Destroying Angel and Daemons of Evil Interrupting the Orgies of the Vicious and Intemperate, which was {{seen by many as}} a renunciation of his earlier, more openly sensual works. Etty remained a prominent painter of nudes, but from 1832 onwards made conscious efforts to reflect moral lessons. Despite this he continued to be regarded as a pornographer by many, long after his death in 1849; as late as 1882 Vanity Fair was able to comment that [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>only</b> too well how the rough and his female companion behave in front of pictures such as Etty's bather.

500|$|Gibson's {{writing was}} {{positively}} received by science fiction writers Dennis Danvers, Candas Jane Dorsey, and Rudy Rucker. Rucker has written: [...] "ith a poet's touch, he tiles words into wonderful mosaics" [...] and Danvers wrote that [...] "no sentence has a subject {{if it can}} do without one". One critic found the prose to be as [...] "hard and compact as glacier ice" [...] and another that it [...] "gives us sharply observed small moments inscribed with crystalline clarity". Gibson's descriptions of interiors and of the built environments of Tokyo, Russia and London were singled out as impressive, and The Village Voices review remarked that [...] "Gibson expertly replicates the biosphere of a discussion board: the coffee-shop intimacy, the fishbowl paranoia, the splintering factions, the inevitable flame war". Lisa Zeidner of The New York Times Book Review elaborated: As usual, Gibson's prose is ... corpuscular, crenelated. His sentences slide from silk to steel, and take tonal joy rides from the ironic to the earnest. But he never gets lost in the language, as he sometimes has in the past. Structurally, this may be his most confident novel. The secondary characters and their subplots are more fully developed, right down to their personal e-mail styles. Without any metafictional grandstanding, Gibson nails the texture of Internet culture: {{how it feels to}} be close to someone you <b>know</b> <b>only</b> as a voice in a chat room, or to fret about someone spying on your browser's list of sites visited. Filled with name-dropping of businesses and products, such as MUJI, Hotmail, iBook, Netscape, and G4, the language of the novel was judged by one critic to be [...] "awkward in its effort to appear [...] "cool"" [...] while other critics have found it overdone and feared it would quickly date the novel. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette review commented that the [...] "constant, unadulterated [...] "hipster-technocrat, cyber-MTV" [...] lingo [...] overdone and inappropriate" [...] On the technology, Cory Doctorow found Gibson's use of watermarks and keystroke logging to be hollow and has noted that [...] "Gibson is no technologist, he's an accomplished and insightful social critic ... and he treats these items from the real world as metaphor. But ... Gibson's metaphorical treatment of these technologies will date this very fine book".|$|E
