However, instrumental drifts that can occur between <b>individual</b> <b>measurements</b> destroy the ideal data structure and thus the advantages. A method based on rank annihilation factor analysis (RAFA) is introduced for the correction of several types of instrumental inconsistencies. It can be applied to many series of bilinear datasets.

50|$|Consider {{a quantum}} {{system with a}} Hilbert space of {{dimension}} 3 or larger, and suppose that there exists some function that assigns a probability to each outcome of any possible measurement upon that system. The probability of any such outcome must be a real number between 0 and 1 inclusive, {{and in order to}} be consistent, for any <b>individual</b> <b>measurement</b> the probabilities of the different possible outcomes must add up to 1. Gleasons theorem shows that any such function - that is, any consistent assignment of probabilities to measurement outcomes - must be expressible in terms of a quantum-mechanical density operator and the Born rule. In other words, given that each quantum system is associated with a Hilbert space, and given that measurements are described by particular mathematical entities defined on that Hilbert space, both the structure of quantum state space and the rule for calculating probabilities from a quantum state then follow.|$|E
5000|$|In {{science and}} technology, an {{arbitrary}} unit (abbreviated arb. unit, see below)or procedure defined unit (p.d.u.)is a relative {{unit of measurement}} to show the ratio of amount of substance, intensity, or other quantities, to a predetermined reference measurement. The reference measurement is typically defined by the local laboratories or dependent on <b>individual</b> <b>measurement</b> apparatus. It is therefore impossible to compare [...] "1 arb. unit" [...] by one measurer and [...] "1000 arb. unit" [...] by another measurer without detailed prior knowledge on how the respective [...] "arbitrary units" [...] were defined; thus, the unit is sometimes called an unknown unit. The unit only serves to compare multiple measurements performed in similar environment, since the ratio between the measurement and the reference is a consistent and dimensionless quantity independent of what actual units are used.Units of such kind are commonly used in fields such as physiology to indicate substance concentration, and spectroscopy to express spectral intensity.|$|E
5000|$|The theorem states that, {{given the}} axioms, {{if the two}} experimenters in {{question}} are free to make choices about what measurements to take, then {{the results of the}} measurements cannot be determined by anything previous to the experiments. Since the theorem applies to any arbitrary physical theory consistent with the axioms, it would not even be possible to place the information into the universe's past in an ad hoc way. The argument proceeds from the Kochen-Specker theorem, which shows that the result of any <b>individual</b> <b>measurement</b> of spin was not fixed independently of the choice of measurements. As stated by Cator and Landsman regarding hidden variable theories: [...] "There has been a similar tension between the idea that the hidden variables (in the pertinent causal past) should on the one hand include all ontological information relevant to the experiment, {{but on the other hand}} should leave the experimenters free to choose any settings they like." ...|$|E

40|$|Management Control {{involves}} {{using different}} systems to lead and manage {{members of an}} organization to achieve strategic objectives. Performance measurements are usually applied to verify and evaluate the achievement of objectives. Individuals in organizations face an increased demand of performance due to the last decades of business world changes. The use of <b>individual</b> performance <b>measurements</b> have become more common in organizations. The purpose of <b>individual</b> performance <b>measurements</b> is to motivate individuals towards achieving individual objectives, which should lead to achieving strategic objectives. Designing <b>individual</b> performance <b>measurements</b> is a complicated procedure that includes challenges for the organization. It is difficult not to have too many measurements and to measure the right activities that lead to achieving strategic objectives. If applying incorrect measures it can affect the individual to make wrong decisions unfavorable to the organization in the long term. <b>Individual</b> performance <b>measurements</b> can also have a negative behavioral effect on the individual, for example stress. The {{purpose of this study}} is to describe <b>individual</b> performance <b>measurement</b> through two perspectives; the management perspective and the individual perspective. The study will answer two research questions: What criteria is perceived as important when designing <b>individual</b> performance <b>measurements,</b> from a management perspective, and why are they important? What individual behavioral effects can be observed from the <b>individual</b> performance <b>measurements</b> and why? A case study was made at LKAB, at a unit applying <b>individual</b> performance <b>measurements.</b> The case study was made by four semi-structured personal interviews. The result of the study shows that four criteria are perceived as important when designing <b>individual</b> performance <b>measurements.</b> These are congruence, feedback, understanding and controllability. The first three criteria can be connected with the purpose of individual performance measurements; that they should lead to achieving strategic objectives. Controllability is perceived as important due to the fact that individuals are assessed on the performance measurements, and therefore should have control over them. The most distinguishable behavioral effect of individual performance measures is that they motivate the individual, this mainly because the individual is involved in the process of designing them. The conclusion of the study is that <b>individual</b> performance <b>measurements</b> are perceived as positive from both perspectives. From a management perspective, not all criteria are equally important when designing <b>individual</b> performance <b>measurements.</b> This seems to be an effect of what kind of activities conducted in the organization. Regarding the individual behavioral effects, it seems to be connected with the individual participating when designing them. The ambition of different individuals and other conditions at the organization also appear to be significant and management should consider this when designing <b>individual</b> performance <b>measurements.</b> Validerat; 20140617 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R
