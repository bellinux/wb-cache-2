5|$|Development of <b>Fallout</b> 4: Nuka-World {{began after}} <b>Fallout</b> 4s November 2015 release. Rumors of Nuka-World began {{circulating}} {{three months before}} the official release after a file hinting at a new expansion was found in <b>Fallout</b> 4s source code. with development confirmed by Matt Grandstaff on the Bethesda Game Studios blog. As with <b>Fallout</b> 4, the game can be played in both first-person and third-person perspectives, with main gameplay consisting of both questing and exploration. Upon completion of quests, the player is rewarded with both the <b>Fallout</b> franchise's main fictional currency, bottle caps from Nuka-Cola bottles, and experience points.|$|E
5|$|Dogmeat is a {{recurring}} dog non-player character (NPC) in the <b>Fallout</b> series of post-apocalyptic themed role-playing video games. Dogmeat was introduced as an optional companion to the player {{character in the}} original <b>Fallout</b> (1997), and has made cameo appearances in the sequel <b>Fallout</b> 2 (1998) and in some other video games. Another, different Dogmeat is featured in the same role in <b>Fallout</b> 3 (2008) and <b>Fallout</b> 4 (2015). In both incarnations of the character, Dogmeat was well received, becoming widely {{regarded as one of}} the best remembered features in the series, as well as one of the most popular sidekick type characters in video gaming overall.|$|E

30|$|Recently, <b>fallouts</b> of salt-rich {{materials}} from the volcanic plume were observed during a high activity of the Nakadake crater, including during ash eruptions. We collected a few different types of the salt <b>fallouts</b> and report their occurrence, textural features and chemical compositions. The composition of the ash leachates and crater lake waters was also analyzed to compare {{with those of the}} salt <b>fallouts.</b> The origin of the salt <b>fallouts</b> precipitated during a period of crater lake absence is discussed, to understand the magmatic–hydrothermal interaction beneath the crater floor.|$|R
5|$|<b>Fallout</b> 3 was {{initially}} under development by Black Isle Studios, a studio owned by Interplay Entertainment, under the working title Van Buren. Black Isle Studios was the developer {{of the original}} <b>Fallout</b> and <b>Fallout</b> 2. When Interplay Entertainment went bankrupt and closed down Black Isle Studios before the game could be completed, the license to develop <b>Fallout</b> 3 was sold for a $1,175,000 minimum guaranteed advance against royalties to Bethesda Softworks, a studio primarily known as the developer of The Elder Scrolls series. Bethesda's <b>Fallout</b> 3, however, was developed from scratch, using neither Van Buren code nor any other materials created by Black Isle Studios. In May 2007, a playable technology demo of the canceled project was released to the public.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Bethesda Softworks {{purchased}} the license {{to develop and}} publish <b>Fallout</b> 3, {{as well as an}} option to create two sequels, from Interplay Entertainment. Three years later they bought the <b>Fallout</b> intellectual property. Bethesda abandoned the original gameplay style of previous <b>Fallout</b> titles; instead of an isometric game with action point/turn-based combat, Bethesda's <b>Fallout</b> 3 was a fully 3D game with real-time combat as well as the action point-based V.A.T.S. system.|$|E
5|$|Above-ground {{nuclear tests}} by the Soviet Union and the United States in the 1950s and early 1960s and by France into the 1970s and 1980s spread a {{significant}} amount of <b>fallout</b> from uranium daughter isotopes around the world. Additional <b>fallout</b> and pollution occurred from several nuclear accidents.|$|E
30|$|Emission of {{water-soluble}} salts from volcanoes is not rare. Volcanic ashes commonly contain water-soluble salts (ash leachates) with variable contents (Witham et al. 2005). Water-soluble salts, such as NaCl and KCl, {{are often}} found in the high-temperature fumarolic sublimates (Symonds 1993; Africano et al. 2002). However, the observation of the salt <b>fallouts</b> from a plume is an uncommon phenomenon, particularly from an ash plume. This study is the first report of such a case, {{as far as the}} authors know. Compositions of the salt <b>fallouts,</b> with the exception of white salt, are similar to the dried lake water samples, indicating the salt <b>fallouts</b> formation caused by the evaporation of the lake water. The salt <b>fallouts</b> have large Mg/Na ratios (close to one), similar to the ratios observed from the dried lake water samples, but different from the ash leachates. Although there are no samples of the fumarolic sublimates at Aso volcano, such sublimates rarely contain Mg-containing salts (Symonds 1993; Africano et al. 2002). The Mg-rich composition of the salt <b>fallouts</b> is different from the Mg-poor fumarolic sublimates.|$|R

5|$|Emil Pagliarulo, {{a former}} writer at Looking Glass Studios, was {{commissioned}} by Bethesda to write the main script of <b>Fallout</b> 3; although he worked in part to 's script. Pagliarulo took charge of writing the incipit of <b>Fallout</b> 3, then played by Ron Perlman, {{and he tried to}} be inspired by first Fallout's incipit, in 1997, which he considered vitally important to describe the story that <b>Fallout</b> 3 would have to tell. To succeed in making this script effective, Pagliarulo, had to go in the opposite direction to his previous work on Oblivion, which both for setting and characters, represented an extreme <b>Fallout</b> inverse.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fallout</b> 3 {{was one of}} {{the most}} played titles in Xbox Live in 2009 and Games for Windows – Live in 2009, 2011, and 2012. In June 2015, {{following}} <b>Fallout</b> 4's announcement at Electronic Entertainment Expo, <b>Fallout</b> 3's sales were boosted up to 1000%. On November 2015, Electronic Entertainment Design and Research, a market research firm, estimated that the game had sold 12.4 million copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fallout</b> Shelter {{became the}} most popular free iOS {{application}} in the U.S. and UK within a day of its release, and the most popular iOS game on June 26, 2015. By June 12, 2016, <b>Fallout</b> Shelter had over 50 million players. Studio director Todd Howard estimated they had 75 million players by February 2017. Because of <b>Fallout</b> Shelters success, the studio {{has been working on}} a second mobile title.|$|E
30|$|Formation of salt shells {{requires}} subtle {{conditions of}} hydrothermal solution flowing {{into a hot}} gas or eruption plume, but can occur at other crater lake bearing volcanoes, such as the Poás and the Copahue volcanoes. The salt <b>fallouts,</b> however, will not be preserved for a long time, as these will easily be crushed to a powder and get blown away or get dissolved by rain water. The salt <b>fallouts</b> can be observed only by frequent examinations at the crater rim on the leeward of the plume during eruptions or active degassing. Such examinations, however, can be risky. The rim of the Nakadake crater is easily accessible by road, enabling frequent exploration of the crater rim with a low risk, even during the active stages. This frequent monitoring has made the observation of rare salt <b>fallouts</b> possible at the Nakadake crater.|$|R

50|$|The game's ruleset {{is mainly}} {{inspired}} by <b>Fallout's</b> SPECIAL system and later editions of Dungeons & Dragons (D&D). It is a classless system with multiple levels of customization. Base ability scores determine a character's core potential, skills represent a character's linear progression in specific skills and feats can grant new abilities, provide passive bonuses or alter a character's existing abilities. The turn-based combat system {{is similar to}} <b>Fallout's</b> with more options added on top of it, {{such as the use}} of special abilities, psionics and more combat utilities. The system is intended to provide many combat options and unique playstyles.|$|R
5|$|<b>Fallout</b> Shelter is a free-to-play {{simulation}} {{video game}} developed by Bethesda Game Studios, with assistance by Behaviour Interactive, {{and published by}} Bethesda Softworks. Part of the <b>Fallout</b> series, it was released worldwide for iOS devices in June 2015, for Android devices in August 2015, for Microsoft Windows in July 2016, and Xbox One in February 2017. The game tasks the player with building and managing their own Vault, a <b>fallout</b> shelter.|$|E
5|$|Upon release, <b>Fallout</b> Shelter {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Critics {{enjoyed the}} game's {{extension of the}} <b>Fallout</b> universe, the core gameplay, and its visual style. Common criticisms included the game's lack of depth, its use of unnecessary microtransactions, and its lack of an ending. The game grossed $5.1 million in microtransaction sales {{in the first two}} weeks after its release.|$|E

5|$|Ash <b>fallout</b> occurs {{immediately}} after the eruption and is controlled by particle density. Initially, coarse particles fall out close to source. This is followed by <b>fallout</b> of accretionary lapilli, {{which is the result}} of particle agglomeration within the column. Ash <b>fallout</b> is less concentrated during the final stages as the column moves downwind. This results in an ash fall deposit which generally decreases in thickness and grain size exponentially with increasing distance from the volcano. Fine ash particles may remain in the atmosphere for days to weeks and be dispersed by high-altitude winds. These particles can impact on the aviation industry (refer to impacts section) and, combined with gas particles, can affect global climate.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} CK722 were direct <b>fallouts</b> from CK718 {{hearing aid}} transistors, {{that did not}} meet specifications. These <b>fallouts</b> were later stamped with CK721 or CK722 numbers based on gain, noise and other dynamic characteristics. Early CK722's were plastic encapsulated and had a black body. As Raytheon improved its production of hearing aid transistors {{with the introduction of}} the smaller CK78x series, the body of the CK721/CK722's was changed to a metal case. Raytheon, however kept the basic body size and used a unique method by taking the smaller CK78x rejects and inserting it into the larger body and sealing it. The first metal-cased CK721/CK722's were blue and the later ones were silver. More details of this can be found in Jack Ward's website, Semiconductor Museum or the CK722 Museum- see external link reference below.|$|R
