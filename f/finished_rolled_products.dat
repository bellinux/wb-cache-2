40|$|Oxide scale {{can affect}} {{many aspects of}} hot metal forming operations, such as heat transfer, {{friction}} and the final surface <b>finish</b> of the <b>rolled</b> <b>product.</b> Surface oxide scale is always present on the steel slab and sometimes on cold rolls. Therefore, {{the study of the}} thermo-mechanical behaviour of oxide scale, particularly under conditions {{as close as possible to}} the steel manufacturing process is very important. In order to undertake a detailed study of oxide scale behaviour, several hightemperature testing techniques were applied. First, high-temperature tensile tests were carried out to investigate the brittle fracture and cracking of the surface oxide scales. Second, high-temperature compression tests were developed and the results obtained revealed many different failure mechanisms that are present in the compressed oxide scale. Finally, a tensile-compressive test was developed and performed under thermal conditions which were as close as possible to hot rolling. The best results in the understanding of oxide scale failure were achieved by closely linked combination of laboratory testing and measurements coupled with detailed finite element analysis. A close microstructural examination of the morphology of oxides was carried out after each experiment and finite element modelling was performed. The three-dimensional finite element simulations helped to improve the interpretation of the thermo-mechanical testing and to obtain more accurate heat transfer and stress-strain relationships. In this work the following thermo-mechanical failure modes of the oxide scales were observed and investigated: brittle fracture (through-thickness cracking, blister failure), indications of plastic behaviour (arrested cracks, unbroken top layers of the oxide scale) and a sticking effect (equivalent to the mill pick-up) ...|$|R

40|$|Measurements of {{graphite}} {{have been}} studied for thermal white cast iron samples, where data from thermal analysis {{has been compared to}} graphite contents measured in light optical microscope. Data from the thermal analysis gives random outcome and is therefore not suitable as a measurement of graphite content in white cast iron. The reason for this is the low amount of graphite in white cast iron. Furthermore, the sampling for the thermal analysis must be performed at comparable temperatures in order to provide usable data. Sampling from thermal analysis for nodular cast iron has been compared to samples taken from the rollpin on <b>finished</b> <b>rolls.</b> The result indicates that the thermal analysis samples have a lower amount of graphite compared to the <b>finished</b> <b>rolls.</b> The {{reason for this is that}} the thermal analysis samples cool faster than the <b>finished</b> <b>rolls,</b> which are larger and demand longer cooling time.

40|$|The {{high quality}} {{requirements}} of sheet metal (eg steel, aluminium) {{and the modern}} trends towards computer control of sheet rolling have placed an increasing emphasis on {{a thorough understanding of}} the physics of the flat rolling process. The examination of the thermal behaviour of the <b>rolls</b> and <b>rolled</b> <b>product,</b> as the latter is deformed in a rolling stand, is integral to an understanding of rolling. The thermal process occurring in the rolling stands affects the mechanical and metallurgical properties of the material, governs the roll cooling requirements, and influences the overall flatness of the <b>rolled</b> <b>product.</b> This thesis is primarily concerned with the prediction of the short-time variation of the temperature field of the <b>rolls</b> and <b>rolled</b> <b>product,</b> as the latter is deformed in a rolling stand. The effect of an oxide layer, which often exists in hot rolling of steel, on the thermal process has been studied in detail. It is demonstrated that, under normal rolling conditions, the thermal process occurring in rolling can be reduced by perturbation methods to one of heat transfer between three slabs with plane parallel boundary contact. As a result, the reduction in heat loss to the rolls and the increase in temperature of the <b>rolled</b> <b>product</b> due to the insulating effect of the oxide layer can be quantified. The contribution of each heat source term, namely, that arising from the effect of the bulk temperature difference between the <b>roll</b> and <b>rolled</b> <b>product,</b> frictional heating at the roll/rolled product contact region, and deformation heating in the <b>rolled</b> <b>product</b> within the <b>roll</b> gap, to the overall thermal process is estimated for both hot and cold rolling conditions...|$|R
