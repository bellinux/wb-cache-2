5|$|Early Tiger IIs proved unreliable, owing principally to leaking {{seals and}} gaskets, and an {{overburdened}} drive train originally intended for a lighter vehicle. The double radius steering gear was initially particularly prone to failure.

5|$|The 500Hispanic {{settlers}} who {{had lived}} near Los Adaes had to resettle in San Antonio in 1773.

Lacking uniforms, the volunteers improvised by wearing a red triangle on their blue shirts to avoid being mistaken for Japanese by the Australians.|$|E

Ellen Harvelle (Samantha Ferris), owner of the now-destroyed Roadhouse, then arrives, and is forced to drink holy water to prove {{that she is not}} possessed by a demon. After giving them a map of Wyoming that Ash had left in the Roadhouse's safe, she points out five X's that have been marked, representing frontier churches built by Samuel Colt—hunter and creator of the mystical Colt, a gun capable of killing anything. Research also shows that railway lines connect all the churches {{in the form of a}} pentagram, creating a giant devil's trap that demons cannot enter.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, the Eskimos {{utilized}} {{a committee}} of running backs, with McCarty, Daniel Porter, and Jerome Messam all receiving significant playing time. McCarty was used mostly in short-yardage situations on the ground, while also being active as a receiver and on special teams. He played in 18 games, made eight starts, and finished with 209 yards on 52 carries with no touchdowns. He also caught 22 passes for 150 yards and a touchdown. McCarty played in both of the Eskimos' playoff games. In the West Semi-Finals against the Stampeders, he rushed for a goal-line touchdown, in addition to making three receptions and two special-teams tackles. McCarty played a more limited role in the West Finals against the BC Lions, where he was <b>given</b> <b>only</b> one carry for six yards, made one tackle on special teams, and caught two passes {{for a total of}} four yards.|$|E
5|$|Jordan {{was home}} to 2,117,361 Palestinians in 2015, most of them Jordanian citizens. The first wave of Palestinian {{refugees}} arrived during the 1948 Arab Israeli war and peaked in the 1967 Six Day War and the 1990 Gulf War. In the past, Jordan had given many Palestinian refugees citizenship, however recently Jordanian citizenship is <b>given</b> <b>only</b> in rare cases. 370,000 of these Palestinians live in UNRWA refugee camps. Following the capture of the West Bank by Israel in 1967, Jordan revoked the citizenship of thousands of Palestinians to thwart any attempt to permanently resettle from the West Bank to Jordan. West Bank Palestinians with family in Jordan or Jordanian citizenship were issued yellow cards guaranteeing them all the rights of Jordanian citizenship if requested.|$|E
