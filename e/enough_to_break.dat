5|$|Many {{people believe}} the urban myth that the daddy longlegs Opiliones {{have the most}} {{poisonous}} bite in the spider world, but that the fangs {{are too small to}} penetrate human skin. This is untrue on several counts. None of the known species of harvestmen have venom glands; their chelicerae are not hollowed fangs but grasping claws that are typically very small and definitely not strong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> human skin.|$|E
5|$|High waves caused beach erosion northward through Virginia. At Virginia Beach, {{the waves}} led to minor {{flooding}} along the Sandbridge section; rough surf {{and a strong}} undertow drowned one swimmer there. The storm triggered statewide power outages that affected about 5,000residents, {{as well as the}} Hampton Roads Bridge–Tunnel. In Newport News, lightning set a roof on fire in the Lee Hall section of the city. Emily's light rains in the area were not <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> a prolonged drought that plagued Virginia. Rough seas and high tides later caused coastal flooding along Fire Island in New York.|$|E
5|$|Just {{after midnight}} the New Zealanders sent the 2nd (Wellington West Coast) Squadron, {{commanded}} by Major James McGregor Elmslie, forward {{to reinforce the}} 9th Squadron. But by itself the 2nd Squadron was not strong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> through the Turkish lines and reach the post, and at times they had to engage in close quarter fighting in the thick scrub. Eventually the 2nd Squadron had to form their own defensive position in the ground between No.2 and No.3 Posts.|$|E

5000|$|... 2003 - With {{the loss}} of several players from the 2002 team, and an offense that was not fully {{installed}} due to time constraints, Alabama suffered through a 4-9 season in 2003. The season was marked by close losses and fourth quarter collapses. In games decided by one score or less, Alabama was 0-6 on the season. Alabama lost overtime games to Arkansas and Tennessee, and generally seemed to be close but not close <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>breaking</b> through virtually all season.|$|R
5|$|Adventure 2 has {{the health}} system found in many other Sonic games. The player {{collects}} rings scattered throughout the levels; being hit by an enemy while holding rings causes the player to drop them all, while being hit without rings causes them to lose a life. Tails and Eggman have the customary health bar, which is slowly refilled by collecting rings. Dying with no lives results in a game over screen. The characters can obtain permanent upgrades that grant them new abilities; for example, one allows Sonic and Shadow to dash along a sequential trail of rings to reach distant platforms, while another lets Knuckles and Rouge attack powerfully <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> certain containers. Chaos Drives {{can be used with}} the player's Chao (small, anthropomorphic animals).|$|E
5|$|Although {{gunpowder}} {{was introduced}} to Europe in the 14thcentury, it did not significantly affect castle building until the 15thcentury, when artillery became powerful <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> through stone walls. While castles continued to be built well into the 16thcentury, new techniques to deal with improved cannon fire made them uncomfortable and undesirable places to live. As a result, true castles went into decline and were replaced by artillery forts with no role in civil administration, and country houses that were indefensible. From the 18thcentury onwards, there was {{a renewed interest in}} castles with the construction of mock castles, part of a romantic revival of Gothic architecture, but they had no military purpose.|$|E
5|$|Narissa {{attempts}} to escape with Giselle's body but is stopped by Edward. Nathaniel, realizing Narissa was using him and never loved him, reveals her plot. Robert realizes that true love's kiss {{is the only}} force powerful <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> the apple's spell. After Edward's kiss fails to wake Giselle, he prompts Robert to do so instead. When Robert kisses her just as the clock strikes twelve, Giselle awakens and the whole crowd cheers. Narissa furiously transforms into a giant blue dragon and takes Robert hostage. Giselle takes Edward's sword and pursues Narissa {{to the top of}} the building. Pip, who was freed by Edward, helps Giselle send Narissa falling to her death.|$|E
50|$|Elastic {{deformation}} {{stretches the}} bonds between atoms {{away from their}} equilibrium radius of separation, without applying <b>enough</b> energy <b>to</b> <b>break</b> the inter-atomic bonds. Plastic deformation, on the other hand, breaks inter-atomic bonds, and therefore involves the rearrangement of atoms in a solid material.|$|R
50|$|Information-theoretic {{security}} is a cryptosystem whose security derives purely from information theory. In other words, it cannot be broken even if the adversary had unlimited computing power. The adversary simply does not have <b>enough</b> information <b>to</b> <b>break</b> the encryption and so the cryptosystems are considered cryptanalytically-unbreakable.|$|R

5|$|The US federal {{government}} intervened, obtaining an injunction against the strike {{on the theory}} that the strikers had obstructed the US Mail, carried on Pullman cars, by refusing to show up for work. President Grover Cleveland, who Debs had supported in all three of his presidential campaigns, sent the United States Army to enforce the injunction. The entrance of the Army was <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> the strike. Overall, 30 strikers were killed in the strike, 13 of them in Chicago, and thousands were blacklisted. An estimated $80 million worth of property was damaged, and Debs was found guilty of contempt of court for violating the injunction and sent to federal prison.|$|E
5|$|After {{realizing that}} no {{reinforcements}} would come, Thomas decided {{to launch a}} counter offensive. Early in {{the third week of}} September 634, Thomas drew men from all sectors of the city to form a force strong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> through the Gate of Thomas. He was there faced by Shurahbil with his corps of about 5,000 men. The Byzantine attack began with a concentrated shower of arrows against the Muslims. The Byzantine infantry, covered by the archers on the wall, rushed through the gate and fanned out into battle formation. Thomas himself led the assault. During this action, Thomas was struck in his right eye by an arrow. Unsuccessful in breaking the Muslim lines, the Byzantines retreated back to the fortress. The wounded Thomas is said to have sworn to take a thousand eyes in return. He ordered another great sortie for that night.|$|E
5|$|Enraged by the deception, Fionna {{takes out}} the crystal sword to fight. The sword {{turns out to be}} another one of Ice Queen’s tricks and turns into a ball of ice around Fionna’s hands. Cake hears noises from downstairs and senses Fionna is in trouble. Undaunted, Fionna uses the ice to beat Ice Queen over the head. Ice Queen pushes her off with a burst of snow which allows Fionna to get close to <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> Prince Gumball free and knock out the Ice Queen with a broken icicle. Cake bursts in and sees Gumball {{standing}} next to Fionna in her torn dress; she jumps to the wrong conclusion and lunges at him but Fionna stops Cake and tells her it was the Ice Queen all along. Just then Ice Queen recovers and blasts Cake away from Fionna only to have Fionna knock her magic tiara off which negates her powers. The real Gumball asks Fionna on a date and is turned down; Fionna notes that she does not need a boyfriend at the moment.|$|E

5000|$|From summer 1942, Germany {{concentrated}} on watching military exercise traffic in Great Britain from KONA 5 in Saint-Germain-en-Laye and the Stationary Intercept Company (Feste) in Bergen.

50|$|The bulk of {{slimline}} {{cases are}} made with translucent or transparent polystyrene, and are available in multiple colors. A stronger alternative is made from semi-opaque, semi-flexible polypropylene which is strong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> protect the disc, but flexible <b>enough</b> not <b>to</b> <b>break</b> easily. Also, the hinge mechanism is inverted compared to the standard-width case, with the pivot arms being attached to {{the lower part of}} the case rather than the clear cover side.|$|R
5|$|On 3October Speedy, while sailing {{once again}} off Gibraltar, spotted ten small ships {{coming out of}} Algeciras, gunboats {{apparently}} attempting to attack a British convoy that was then passing. Brenton identified the ships as merchantmen, attempting to evade the British at Gibraltar in the bad weather. On Speedys approach, they scattered, four sheltering under a fort. Speedy approached and fired on them, causing their crews to abandon their ships. They were driven ashore by the wind, and despite sending boats out, {{it was impossible to}} get them off, so they were left to be reduced to wrecks. Three days later, Speedy was standing off Europa Point when twelve gunboats were sighted coming out of Algeciras to attack two merchant ships making their way past Gibraltar. One, the Unity, was carrying wine and spirits for the fleet. Their combined firepower far outweighed that of Speedy, but Brenton turned his ship towards them, covering the escape of one of the merchantmen with his fire. The gunboats were attempting to catch the Unity when Brenton took his ship through the flotilla, close <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> many of their oars, maintaining a constant fire from his guns and with every spare member of the crew firing muskets. The Spanish flotilla broke and fled. Speedy suffered two men killed and one wounded, and sustained considerable damage to her rigging and below her waterline. She was unable to return to Gibraltar in the rising wind, and was forced to run along the coast to Tétouan Bay, where her shot-holes were plugged to allow her to make her way back. During the engagement with the gunboats, the guns in the fortress of Gibraltar had not fired in support of Speedy. When Brenton asked why, the Governor of Gibraltar, General Charles O'Hara, replied that he had arranged with the Governor of Algeciras for the guns never to be fired at the gunboats so as not to annoy the inhabitants of the town.|$|E
25|$|The first commercially {{successful}} {{steam locomotive}} was Matthew Murray's rack locomotive Salamanca {{built for the}} Middleton Railway in Leeds in 1812. This twin-cylinder locomotive was not heavy <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> the edge-rails track and solved the problem of adhesion by a cog-wheel using teeth cast {{on the side of}} one of the rails. Thus it was also the first rack railway.|$|E
25|$|When Ganthet duplicates {{the seven}} colored rings to deputize {{partners}} {{for each of}} the bearers, the violet ring chooses Wonder Woman as Carol's partner, deciding that no one else has more love for the planet Earth. Wonder Woman was under the control of a black ring (from being one of numerous resurrected superheroes), but she and the violet ring's power are <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> the black ring's hold, turning Wonder Woman into a Star Sapphire.|$|E

25|$|With China's {{liberalization}} in {{the late}} 1970s and its opening up to foreign markets, commercial considerations have made its impact in post-1980s filmmaking. Traditionally arthouse movies screened seldom make <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> even. An example is Fifth Generation director Tian Zhuangzhuang's The Horse Thief (1986), a narrative film with minimal dialog on a Tibetan horse thief. The film, showcasing exotic landscapes, was well received by Chinese and some Western arthouse audiences, but did poorly at the box office.|$|E

25|$|An urban legend {{claims that}} the {{harvestman}} is the most venomous animal in the world, but possesses fangs too short or a mouth too round and small to bite a human, so is not dangerous (the same myth applies to Pholcus phalangioides and the cranefly, which are both also called a 'daddy longlegs'). This is untrue on several counts. None of the known species of harvestmen has venom glands; their chelicerae are not hollowed fangs but grasping claws that are typically very small and not strong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> human skin.|$|E

25|$|For {{aromatic}} substrates, {{the first}} bond is hardest to hydrogenate {{because of the}} free energy penalty for breaking the aromatic system. The product {{of this is a}} cyclohexadiene, which is extremely active and cannot be isolated; in conditions reducing <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> the aromatization, it is immediately reduced to a cyclohexene. The cyclohexene is ordinarily reduced immediately to a fully saturated cyclohexane, but special modifications to the catalysts (such as the use of the anti-solvent water on ruthenium) can preserve some of the cyclohexene, if that is a desired product.|$|E
25|$|It {{looked as}} if the Romans were going to pay for their failure to {{capitalize}} from the victory at the Metaurus river by conquering the Cisalpine Gauls once and for all, but the danger caused by Mago’s landing was not to be overestimated. Even when he received reinforcements from Carthage in the form of about 7,000 troops, 7 elephants and 25 warships his strength was still far from <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> the Roman defences. This is why Mago did not seem to actively pursue the goal set by Carthage – to march south and join Hannibal.|$|E
25|$|With {{the mass}} {{and power of}} {{locomotives}} like the Mallets, care had to be exercised in their operation. A light Mallet used as a pusher naturally connected to the train with its front coupler, {{and the strength of}} this drawhead was not infinite. While the engine could not push hard <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> the drawhead, the engineer needed to avoid slack.
