40|$|The {{antigenic}} {{relationships among}} the neuraminidases of influenza A strains from 1957 to 1973 were examined by postinfection application of neuraminidase antisera. This procedure causes inhibition of virus spread and apparent neutralization. Neuraminidase (apparent) neutralization and neuraminidase <b>inhibition</b> <b>tests</b> with chicken antisera gave similar results. Neuraminidase <b>inhibition</b> <b>tests</b> were more discriminating than neuraminidase neutralization tests when rabbit and goat antisera were used. Antibody absorption studies revealed that the neuraminidase, like the hemagglutinin, may possess two kinds of antigenic determinants, which can give rise to "common," or "cross-reacting," and "specific" antibodies. "Specific" antibody {{appears to be more}} effective in the inhibition of enzyme activity than in the inhibition of virus spread...|$|R
40|$|Avian {{influenza}} viruses replicate in {{a variety}} of mammals and birds, yet hemagglutination <b>inhibition</b> <b>tests</b> show that postinfection sera from these animals (e. g., ferrets and ducks) have insignificant levels of antibodies (Hinshaw et al., Infect. Immun. 34 : 354 - 361, 1981). This suggested that avian influenza viruses, in contrast to mammalian viruses, may not induce a significant humoral response. Studies reported here indicate that avian influenza viruses do induce high levels of antibodies in ferrets, ducks, and mice and produce long-lived memory for cytotoxic T-cells in mice. The failure to detect hemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies to avian viruses was explained by the finding that antibodies to avian influenza viruses were not detectable in hemagglutination <b>inhibition</b> <b>tests</b> with intact virus yet were readily demonstrable when hemagglutinin subunits were used. In addition, these sera contained high levels of neutralizing antibodies to the avian virus. These findings suggest that the hemagglutinins of avian and mammalian influenza viruses may differ in their accessibility to antibodies or the biological consequence of antibody attachment or both. The practical consequence of these studies is that hemagglutination <b>inhibition</b> <b>tests</b> with intact avian viruses fail to detect antibody and do not correlate with virus neutralization. The avian virus used in these studies, A/Mallard/NY/ 6870 / 78 (H 2 N 2), replicated and caused mortality in BALB/c mice, emphasizing that the host range and virulence of avian viruses extends to mammals. The above findings suggest that avian viruses could infect mammals in nature, yet seroepidemiological studies with conventional hemagglutination <b>inhibition</b> <b>tests</b> could give misleading results...|$|R
40|$|A rotavirus, {{designated}} as the H- 1 strain, was isolated from a diarrheic foal in primary African green monkey kidney cells and MA 104 cells. This cell culture-adapted strain hemagglutinated erythrocytes of human group O, rhesus monkeys, guinea pigs, and sheep. It {{was found to be}} similar, if not identical, to porcine rotaviruses (strains OSU, EE, and A- 580) by plaque reduction neutralization and hemagglutination <b>inhibition</b> <b>tests,</b> and, in addition, it was found to belong to subgroup 1. This equine rotavirus has an RNA electrophoretic migration pattern which was distinct from those of the three strains of porcine rotavirus. The serological relationship established by plaque reduction neutralization and hemagglutination <b>inhibition</b> <b>tests</b> between the equine (H- 1) and porcine (OSU, EE, and A- 580) rotaviruses {{is an example of a}} rotavirus of the same serotype being isolated from different species. The H- 1 strain was distinct from four human rotavirus serotypes (Wa, DS- 1, P, and St. Thomas 4) as well as from bovine rotavirus NCDV, simian rotavirus MMU 18006, and canine rotavirus CU- 1 by plaque reduction neutralization tests.

50|$|Acute Toxicity Comparison & Inhibition Tests are {{the best}} {{procedures}} for testing samples with {{a low level of}} toxicity when an ECxx can not be determined using the Basic Test. These protocols are recommended for testing waste water treatment plant effluent, stormwater runoff, drinking water, pore water, and eluate. These tests use multiple replicates of a sample at a single concentration. Similar to the Basic Test, the Comparison Test protocol uses zero time light readings used for correcting the timed light level readings. The <b>Inhibition</b> <b>Test</b> procedure does not use zero time light readings and therefore, can not use a correction factor for the timed light level readings. Both of these tests consists of five controls and five replicates of the sample at a single concentration.|$|E
50|$|In Sweden, the {{industry}} together with universities {{and health care}} sector has developed a method for environmental risk assessment and environmental classification of drugs. Environmental risk refers {{to the risk of}} toxicity to the aquatic environment. It is based on the ratio between predicted environmental concentration of the substance (PEC) and the highest concentration of the substance that does not have a harmful effect in the environment (PNEC). Environmental hazard expresses the inherent environmentally damaging characteristics of the substance in terms of persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity. The toxicity tests used are acute toxicity of fish, acute toxicity of Daphnia sp. and growth <b>inhibition</b> <b>test</b> of algae. Most medications on the Swedish market are now classified. This gives the health care possibilities to make better choices when prescribing medicines.|$|E
50|$|There {{are five}} major Microtox tests {{including}} the Basic Test, the 100% Test, the Solid Phase Test, the Comparison Test, and the <b>Inhibition</b> <b>Test.</b> Of these five tests, three {{are used for}} sediment and soil testing including the Basic Test, the 100% Test and the Solid-Phase Test. All of these versions follow the same general method of reconstituting the Allivibrio fischeri reagent in the Reconstitution Solution. Corrections are made for salinity and particulate matter, then the bacteria {{are exposed to the}} sample solution depending on the methods of the particular test. The light output of the bacteria is measured using a photometer after five and 15 minutes from exposing the bacteria to the samples. The light measured directly correlates to the toxicity of the sample, producing data that allows for the calculation of EC50 or IC50s, or other ECxx and ICxx values.|$|E

50|$|Wenger's 1936 study {{examined}} {{if the same}} external stimulus {{can be used to}} demonstrate both external inhibition and disinhibition and the relationship of the external stimulus to the intensity of external inhibition and disinhibition. Wenger conditioned participants with electro-dermal response (raising the foot to avoid the shock) to a red light using repeating presentations of a red light paired with a shock to the right foot. After the participants were conditioned, the extra stimulus of a tactual vibration to the left hand was introduced before the red light was shown {{in the absence of a}} shock stimulus. Following the principles of external inhibition, Wenger hypothesized that the after-effect of the tactual vibration would inhibit the conditioned response to the red light and lead to smaller movements of the foot to the red light.Disinhibition was tested after experimental extinction, where the red light was presented multiple times without any shock reinforcement. Following the principles of disinhibition, Wenger hypothesized that the tactual vibration will induce a greater reaction to the light stimuli when compared to the reactions from the external <b>inhibition</b> <b>test.</b> Both of Wenger's hypotheses were confirmed; Wenger observed that both external inhibition and disinhibition could be produced by the same external stimulus (tactual vibration). In addition, higher intensity of the external stimulus produced greater magnitudes of external inhibition and disinhibition however the functional strengths of externally inhibited and disinhibited responses were not considered decisive.|$|E
