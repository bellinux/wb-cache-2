Tricky disliked the term, saying [...] "I was {{supposed}} to have invented trip hop, and I will fucking deny having anything to do with it". In a retrospective review for Stylus Magazine, Hebert argued that [...] "there's too much here to be sequestered to any genre, let alone that one... Calling Tricky 'trip-hop' is a bit like calling Prince 'pop'. It's partially accurate, but the music <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> than that." [...] In Mojo, Victoria Segal later called Maxinquaye [...] "an exotic, erotic alien that nobody (not least its creator) has managed to clone". It was dubbed [...] "the British postmodern album of the 90s" [...] by Jason Draper of Record Collector and [...] "a visionary post-rock statement" [...] by The Philadelphia Inquirers Tom Moon, while AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine said it remained [...] "a bracing sonic adventure that gains richness and resonance with each listen" [...] because of the songs' imaginative structures and exceptional use of [...] "noise and experimental music". In The Village Voice, Christgau believed its significance lied in an aesthetic of cool derived from the blues and African-American culture, which valued a self-possessed resolve in the face of oppression: ...|$|E
2500|$|Shakespeare says, in essence, {{that the}} Fair Youth <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> {{than he is}} that Shakespeare can't {{possibly}} deserve him. [...] Being unworthy, Shakespeare wants to release the Youth from the relationship so that [...] "he can have the better life that he deserves". [...] In the closing couplet, Shakespeare says that while the relationship lasted, {{he felt like a}} king, but now he realizes it was simply a dream.|$|E
2500|$|Relationship talk is a {{remediation}} {{strategy that}} focuses on discussing the transgression {{in the context of}} the relationship. [...] Aune et al. (1998) identified two types of relationship talk, relationship invocation and metatalk. [...] Relationship invocation involves using the relationship as a backdrop for a discussion of the transgression. [...] For example, “We are too committed to this relationship to let it fail.”, or “Our relationship <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> than any of my previous relationships.”. [...] Metatalk involves discussing the effect of the transgression on the relationship. [...] For example, infidelity may cause partners to redefine rules of the relationship and reexamine the expectations of commitment each partner expects from the other.|$|E

2500|$|Michael Fairman {{said the}} {{character}} of Kiki [...] "has often proved problematic for the audience, at times, to invest in." [...] He later said, [...] "Kiki has never really felt to the audience as the most fully-fleshed out character, and that is even from the time Kristen Alderson was playing the role and had to quickly shift from playing Starr Manning to the newly-created character of Kiki. Omar Nobloes from TV Source Magazine [...] said {{the debate over whether}} a recast was needed would be [...] "futile" [...] and expressed his hope that the recast would help to [...] "reset" [...] Kiki who started off with [...] "promise" [...] and later turned into a [...] "watered down" [...] Starr. Nobles described Erin as a good actress and praised her tenure on The Young and the Restless. Looking forward to seeing her in the role, Nobles hoped viewers would give the actress a chance to make the character her own. Jenn Bishop praised Kiki's downward spiral after losing her father and discovering Ava and Morgan's betrayal. [...] "It's amazing how entertaining Kiki is now" [...] Bishop stated. She continued, [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> than the clueless vestal virgin of the Corinthos clan we had to suffer through for too long." [...] She continued that Kiki hitting [...] "rockbottom" [...] was a good way of [...] "rebooting the character" [...] and develop Kiki into a [...] "more viable" [...] character. [...] "Embracing the character's aimlessness and tendency to make poor choices feels right." [...] Bishop also praised Erin's potential as Kiki and said all she needed was the right story.|$|E
2500|$|Underwood {{has been}} highly {{acclaimed}} for her vocal talents. David Wild of Rolling Stone has praised her voice, saying that [...] "she can hit any note". Her vocal range {{has been described}} as [...] "enormous", with critics highlighting her ability to hold notes {{for an extended period of}} time. Billboard describes her vocal ability as [...] "freakish". Concert critics have pointed out that [...] "she’ll let loose with an improbably long note that runs through more octaves than you knew existed". When asked if it ever becomes difficult to belt at such high intensity during her 90–120 minute live shows, Underwood responded, [...] "I'm too proud to drop keys. I won't do it. Maybe the older I get, I'll write some songs in lower keys so it'll be easier. I've always been pretty good as far as stamina onstage. Being able to work out and stay physically strong is important... So far, it's worked for me. I'm just blessed at being able to be loud for long periods of time." [...] Fellow country music singer Randy Travis paid high praises to Underwood's voice when asked about her cover of his 1988 hit song [...] "I Told You So", saying that [...] "her voice <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> suited to the song. I have a baritone voice, and her soprano voice really fits well with the range of the song. Her ability to get into the upper register of her voice and just hold those high notes is great." [...] Her voice has also been praised as [...] "versatile". She has indeed performed live versions of gospel songs like [...] "How Great Thou Art", in which Yahoo! critics noticed her ability to move an audience with a [...] "powerful performance", and Rock songs like Guns N' Roses' [...] "Paradise City", with Rolling Stone critics saying it was a [...] "standout performance", adding that [...] "when the song reached its crescendo, the singer went right over the edge with it, twirling like a tornado and tossing in more than a few banshee wails" [...] and even saying [...] "if the original members of Guns N' Roses ever wanted to reunite without Axl Rose, they might be wise to ask Carrie Underwood to fill his bandana".|$|E
