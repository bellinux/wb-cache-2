40|$|This paper {{examines}} the equilibrium {{degree of flexibility}} adopted by firms competing in oligopolistic product markets in which the value of flexibility arises from the initial presence of uncertainty over consumer preferences and its eventual resolution. The equilibrium choice of flexible mode depends on the following factors: (1) the cost of switching product design in response to revealed consumer preferences, (2) {{the difference in the}} acquisition costs of the flexible and <b>dedicated</b> <b>modes,</b> and (3) the precision of the ex ante information held by the firms regarding consumer preferences. The relationship between these factors and the equilibrium choice of modes is fully characterized. Copyright (c) 1998 Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ...|$|R

One problem that arose was that the Republic of Ireland's kit changed to De Graafschap of Netherlands. Konami then released another update on October 15 to correct this mistake.|$|E

However, this is generally untrue. There are four modes in which one can operate a multilevel secure system (viz.., multilevel mode, compartmented mode, <b>dedicated</b> <b>mode,</b> and system-high mode) and, as specified by the National Computer Security Center's [...] "Yellow Book," [...] B3 and A1 systems can only be used for processing a strict subset of security labels, and only when operated according to a particularly strict configuration.|$|E
50|$|Every cell is {{assigned}} a Cell Allocation (CA) Table. This is {{the set of}} ARFCNs that are used within the Cell. The Mobile Allocation (MA) Table is a subset of this CA Table. This table contains a list of ARFCNs that the traffic channels of that cell will hop through. The MAIO gives the index into this list from which the first ARFCN will be picked by the cell to start the hopping sequence. Every mobile station will be supplied with the MA Table and MAIO for a given dedicated connection. Using the MA table and the MAIO, the mobile station will hop in the exact sequence as the cell in <b>dedicated</b> <b>mode</b> to achieve frequency diversity. Thus, the MA Table, MAIO and the Hopping Sequence Number (HSN) completely configure a hopping sequence procedure which the mobile station and the cell will follow.|$|E

Only {{until a few years}} ago, {{telemedicine}} was equated to video teleconferencing between physicians, while nowadays, perhaps the most active area in telemedicine is the store-and-forward model. There is a big shift from private and <b>dedicated</b> <b>modes</b> of communications to connectivity through the Internet. Presented is a collection of applications that provide snapshots of this diversity. The key technical challenges identified from these experiences are connectivity and integration. Also, at issue are the evolution process through which a telemedicine application evolves and the ability to choose the right set of technology for the diverse type of telemedicine applications. With the projected improvements in speed and quality of the Internet, wireless communication, and persona...|$|R

40|$|Interactions {{between the}} {{computing}} units {{and the physical}} environment in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSes) are considered to verify safety properties, i. e. ensuring the un-intentional side-effects of cyber-physical interactions are within desired limits. A Linear 1 space dimension Spatio-Temporal Hybrid Automata (L 1 STHA) is defined to capture {{the effects of the}} interactions, in both time and space. Aggregate effects of interactions due to concurrent operations in the computing entities are expressed as a set of interdependent partial differential equations associated with <b>dedicated</b> <b>modes</b> of the L 1 STHA model. A time and space bound L 1 STHA reachability analysis algorithm is proposed for safety verification, which provides reachable states of the L 1 STHA with an arbitrary accuracy ɛ. The runtime of the algorithm depends on the requested accuracy. The usage of the L 1 STHA modeling and analysis is demonstrated for medical CPSes such as infusion pumps...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{centralized}} decision making framework at the macro base station (MBS) for device to device (D 2 D) communication underlaying a two-tier cellular network. We consider a D 2 D pair {{in the presence}} of an MBS and a femto access point, each serving a user, with quality of service constraints for all users. Our proposed solution encompasses mode selection (choosing between cellular or reuse or <b>dedicated</b> <b>mode),</b> resource allocation (in cellular and <b>dedicated</b> <b>mode)</b> and power control (in reuse mode) within a single framework. The framework prioritizes D 2 D <b>dedicated</b> <b>mode</b> if the D 2 D pair are close to each other and orthogonal resources are available. Otherwise, it allows D 2 D reuse mode if the D 2 D satisfies both the maximum distance and an additional interference criteria. For reuse mode, we present a geometric vertex search approach to solve the power allocation problem. We analytically prove the validity of this approach and show that it achieves near optimal performance. For cellular and dedicated modes, we show that frequency sharing maximizes sum rate and solve the resource allocation problem in closed form. Our simulations demonstrate the advantages of the proposed framework in terms of the performance gains achieved in D 2 D mode. Comment: Submitted for possible journal publicatio...|$|E
