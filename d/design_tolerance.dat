In this paper, we view the part qualification problem as an issue of finding an admissible point in transformation space. Based on the concept of admissible point, we develop theories and algorithms for part geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T) conformance check.

An admissible transformation volume (ATV) is used to quantitatively characterize the quality of manufactured parts with respect to <b>design</b> <b>tolerance</b> specifications.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{reliable}} {{approach to the}} <b>tolerance</b> <b>design</b> of electronic circuits is presented. Firstly, the tolerances of parameters are maximized {{by means of an}} evolutionary algorithm according to the design constraints. This optimization step is based on vertex analysis: each candidate solution is considered as feasible if the design constraints are fulfilled in all of the vertices of the tolerance region corresponding to that solution. This approach ensures fast computation and good results provided that the region of acceptability is convex and simply connected. Otherwise, the actual feasibility of the <b>designed</b> <b>tolerance</b> region is verified. To this purpose, a recursive divide-and-conquer algorithm based on interval arithmetic is used. It allows detecting possible infeasibility pockets included in the <b>designed</b> <b>tolerance</b> region and neglected during the optimization step. Any portion of the boundaries of the region of acceptability that is included in the tolerance region is identified and the analysis is refined across it. The technique proposed in the paper has been applied to the <b>tolerance</b> <b>design</b> of two different possible realizations of the feedback control network of a voltage-mode regulated DC-DC converter.

40|$|Abstract – The {{successful}} use of embedded resistors in {{many applications}} will {{require that the}} fabricated resistors be trimmed prior to lamination into printed circuit boards to attain required design tolerances. Depending on the application, the economic value of the board being fabricated, and the process used to create the embedded resistors, {{it may also be}} prudent to consider reworking resistors that are incorrectly trimmed or with initial values that are too large (un-trimmable resistors). This paper uses a model of the resistor/board yield coupled with a cost model of the trim and rework processes to identify conditions under which applications should neither trim nor rework, trim but not rework, or perform both trimming and rework of embedded resistors, {{as a function of the}} <b>design</b> <b>tolerance</b> for the resistors and the accuracy with which the embedded resistors can be formed.
