Unlike the Wilson cloud, a meteorological phenomenon <b>in</b> <b>clean</b> air, the base surge was a heavy fog bank of radioactive mist that rolled across all the target ships, coating their surfaces with fission products. When the mist in the base surge evaporated, the base surge became invisible but continued to move away, contaminating ships several miles from the detonation point.|$|E
5|$|On September 6, Mayor Ray Nagin {{ordered a}} forced {{evacuation}} of {{everyone from the}} city who was not involved <b>in</b> <b>clean</b> up work, citing safety and health concerns. The order was given not only {{as an attempt to}} restore law and order, but also out of concern about the hazardous living conditions in the city. Eviction efforts escalated three days later, when door-to-door searches were conducted to advise remaining residents to leave the city. Despite this, a number of residents defied the eviction order. While initially lax in enforcing evictions, National Guard troops eventually began to remove residents by force.|$|E

5|$|Carpet beetles {{are members}} of the family Dermestidae, and while the adult beetles feed on nectar and pollen, the larvae are {{destructive}} pests in homes, warehouses and museums. They feed on animal products including wool, silk, leather, fur, the bristles of hair brushes, pet hair, feathers and museum specimens. They tend to infest hidden locations and may feed on larger areas of fabrics than do clothes moths, leaving behind specks of excrement and brown, hollow, bristly-looking cast skins. Management of infestations is difficult and is based on exclusion and sanitation where possible, resorting to pesticides when necessary. The beetles can fly in from outdoors and the larvae can survive on lint fragments, dust and inside the bags of vacuum cleaners. In warehouses and museums, sticky traps baited with suitable pheromones can be used to identify problems, and heating, freezing, spraying the surface with insecticide and fumigation will kill the insects when suitably applied. Susceptible items can be protected from attack by keeping them <b>in</b> <b>clean</b> airtight containers.|$|E

It was his second Olympics appearance; he was ranked previously 14th in the same weight category at the 2004 Athens Olympics. The whole competition took place on August 19, but was divided in two parts due {{to the number of}} competitors. Group B weightlifters competed at 15:30 CST, and Group A, at 19:00 CST. The event was the fifteenth and last weightlifting event to conclude. Itte competed in group B of the event; his highest successfully lifted weight in snatch was 175kg, out of 165, 170 and 175kg, and <b>in</b> <b>clean</b> and jerk his best was 210kg, out of 205 and 210kg, he also tried a failed attempt for 215kg.

5|$|Kenny Bräck won {{the pole}} {{position}} and maintained his advantage {{heading into the}} first lap. He led {{for a total of}} 134 laps, more than any other competitor. Franchitti employed a strategy that enabled him to drive <b>in</b> <b>clean</b> air while other drivers made pit stops. Bräck reclaimed the lead for the lap-163 restart, but lost it six laps later when a crew member dropped a wheel nut which cost him time. Franchitti took over the lead and held it {{for the remainder of the}} event to clinch the victory. It was Franchitti's third win of the season, his first on an oval track, and the tenth (and final) of his CART career. There were five cautions and nine lead changes during the course of the race.|$|E
5|$|Mayflies are {{distributed}} {{all over the}} world <b>in</b> <b>clean</b> freshwater habitats, though absent from Antarctica. They tend to be absent from oceanic islands or represented by one or two species that have dispersed from nearby mainland. Female mayflies may be dispersed by wind, and eggs may be transferred by adhesion to the legs of waterbirds. The greatest generic diversity is found in the Neotropic ecozone, while the Holarctic has a smaller number of genera but a high degree of speciation. Some thirteen families are restricted to a single bioregion. The main families have some general habitat preferences: the Baetidae favour warm water; the Heptageniidae live under stones and prefer fast-flowing water; and the relatively large Ephemeridae make burrows in sandy lake or river beds.|$|E

30|$|The triterpanes (Fig.  3 b) and steranes (Fig.  3 c) {{fractions}} of oil-based drilling mud show slightly higher retention time compared to regular molecular compounds. The deviated retention times in drilling fluids {{can also be}} used as a proxy to recognize the degree of contamination <b>in</b> <b>cleaned</b> rock cuttings (Brocks et al. 2003; Shang et al. 2006; Reddy et al. 2007). The mixing of residual heavier components (e.g., asphalt/gilsonite, barium sulfate, and artificial additives) can cause higher retention times after each regular homologue, as shown by the triterpanes (Fig.  3 b) and steranes (Fig.  3 c) fractions in oil-based drilling mud. Consequently, the reduction of retention times <b>in</b> <b>cleaned</b> rock cuttings can generally indicate cleansing of contaminants in the triterpanes and steranes fractions.|$|R
5|$|Most of the gyromitrin must {{be removed}} to render false morels edible. The {{recommended}} procedure involves either first drying and then boiling the mushrooms, or boiling the fresh mushrooms directly. To prepare fresh mushroom {{it is recommended that}} they are cut into small pieces and parboiled twice in copious amounts of water, at least three parts water to one part chopped mushrooms, for at least five minutes, after each boiling the mushroom should be rinsed thoroughly <b>in</b> <b>clean</b> water. Each round of parboiling reduces the gyromitrin contents to a tenth. The gyromitrin is leached into the water where it will remain, therefore the parboiling water must be discarded and replaced with fresh water after each round of boiling. Drying the mushrooms can also reduce the concentration of gyromitrin; ten days of open air desiccation leads to the loss of 90% of gyromitrin. However it is still recommended that the mushroom be boiled after drying.|$|E
5|$|Nakano lost grip in {{the front}} of his vehicle and went {{straight}} into the turn four wall on the same lap. He heavily damaged his car's right-hand side prompting a third caution. Nakano slid through the infield and stopped unhurt on the frontstretch. Bräck led the field back up to speed at the lap-70 restart, with Takagi in second. Green-flag pit stops began on lap 94, with Bräck stopping on the same lap and Franchitti became the leader. It was part of Franchitti's strategy, devised by his team manager Kyle Moyer, to drive <b>in</b> <b>clean</b> air. Andretti was required to serve a stop-and-go penalty, which he took on the 103rd lap, after he was observed speeding in the pit lane. Franchitti made his pit stop four laps later and Manning took over first place. Manning made his pit stop on lap 114 and Bräck reclaimed the lead. After starting from 16th, Dixon was running in sixth place by the 126th lap. He served two stop-and-go penalties because he was twice observed exceeding the pit lane speed limit, while Domínguez was similarly penalised.|$|E
5|$|After passing slower cars, Vettel {{began to}} resume his battle with the Ferrari drivers. Button made a pit stop on lap 22 and reemerged in fifth {{position}} behind his teammate Hamilton. The Ferrari cars began to set faster lap times {{than the rest of}} the field as Massa started to pull away from Alonso and held a lead of three seconds over his teammate. Alonso responded to Massa's newfound pace by recording a new fastest lap of the race, a 1:18.075 on lap 28, having backed out to see how fast his car was <b>in</b> <b>clean</b> air, before the two drivers began to trade fastest times over the next three laps. Webber attempted to place pressure on Button in a battle for fifth place, although Button was using a defensive strategy by using his McLaren's straight-line speed advantage. De La Rosa caught up to Hülkenberg and passed him at the turn six hairpin on lap 35. Three laps later, Hamilton was instructed by McLaren to conserve fuel usage in the event they could use an aggressive fuel saving mode towards the end of the race.|$|E

5|$|Dragonfly nymphs vary in {{form with}} species and are loosely classed into claspers, sprawlers, hiders, and burrowers. The first instar {{is known as}} a prolarva, a {{relatively}} inactive stage from which it quickly moults into the more active nymphal form. The general body plan {{is similar to that of}} an adult, but the nymph lacks wings and reproductive organs. The lower jaw has a huge, extensible labium, armed with hooks and spines, which is used for catching prey. This labium is folded under the body at rest and struck out at great speed by hydraulic pressure created by the abdominal muscles. Whereas damselfly nymphs have three feathery external gills, dragonfly nymphs have internal gills, located around the fourth and fifth abdominal segments. Water is pumped in and out of the abdomen through an opening at the tip. The naiads of some clubtails (Gomphidae) that burrow into the sediment, have a snorkel-like tube at the end of the abdomen enabling them to draw <b>in</b> <b>clean</b> water while they are buried in mud. Naiads can forcefully expel a jet of water to propel themselves with great rapidity.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} group of five runners, Heidfeld paced the session, almost one-tenth of a second faster than Bird in second, who in turn, was a further three-tenths of a second in front of third-placed Buemi who went wide at the first corner on his first timed lap despite being <b>in</b> <b>clean</b> air. Evans and di Grassi (who made a mistake in turn 17) were the group's slowest two drivers. Turvey was the fastest driver in the second group and set the quickest overall group stage time of any {{participant}} at one minute and 2.712 seconds which was 0.053 seconds faster than Abt. López, Félix da Costa and Sarrazin rounded out the top five. In the third group, after the previous four drivers went onto the track, Duval was on his maximum power lap when he spun heading towards the first corner and made contact with the barriers lining the circuit, causing the session to be stopped to allow his car to be extracted from the track. After the session restarted with three minutes remaining, Vergne was the third group's fastest driver, followed by Prost who lost half a second in the track's second sector, with Frijns, Piquet and Duval filling the next three positions.|$|E
5|$|King was {{overtaken}} by Markelov {{on the same}} lap. Marciello overtook Matsushita at the third corner to retake the lead on lap six. Armand crashed into the turn one barriers on the same lap, resulting in the safety car's second appearance. Most drivers elected to make their mandatory pit stops during the safety car period. Marciello remained ahead of Matsushita and maintained the lead when the safety car drove into the pit lane shortly afterwards. Marciello fended off a challenge by Matsushita to retain first position. Pic squeezed Markelov towards the turn five barrier on the ninth lap and both drivers damaged their cars, causing Markelov to retire. Pic drove on for a short distance before retiring because of the damage resulting from the collision. The safety car was sent onto the track for the third time. Marciello maintained his lead at the restart, while Matsushita ran wide at the first turn, allowing Jeffri to pass him for second place. Matsushita dropped to fifth position. Rowland passed both drivers by taking the inside line. Marciello {{pulled away from the}} rest of the field. Having run <b>in</b> <b>clean</b> air, Giovinazzi had moved into third place by the 12th lap, but moved into second two laps later when he overtook Rowland on the start/finish straight with DRS assistance.|$|E

5|$|Maamaloa Lolohea {{participated in}} the Beijing Olympics on Tonga's behalf, {{competing}} in weightlifting. Lolohea was born in Kolofo'ou, a district of the capital city Nuku'alofa, and competed in Beijing as a 40-year-old in the men's super-heavyweight class division, which encompasses athletes who weigh more than 105kilograms. Lolohea had not previously competed at any Olympic games. The Tongan athlete competed in his event on August 19, where he faced 14 other athletes. During the snatch phase of the event, Lolohea was given three attempts. He successfully lifted 127kilograms on his first attempt, 135kilograms on his second attempt, and 140kilograms on his third and final attempt. During the clean and jerk phase of the event, he successfully lifted 173kilograms on his first try, but unsuccessfully attempted to lift 185kilograms on his second and third attempts. Because his highest scores were 140 in snatch and 173 <b>in</b> <b>clean</b> and jerk, Lolohea's final and total score was 313kilograms. Of the 13 competitors who finished the event, Maamaloa Lolohea finished last behind Sam Pera, Jr. of the Cook Islands (350kilograms), who in turn finished behind Finland's Antti Everi (366kilograms). Gold medalist Matthias Steiner of Germany, in contrast, lifted a total of 461kilograms.|$|E
5|$|Turvey's team {{asked him}} to reset his vehicle and a yellow flag was shown to warn drivers about his {{stranded}} car. After three laps, however, {{he was unable to}} restart his vehicle and retired, causing the safety car to be sent onto the track for the second time. With the field closed up, di Grassi and d'Ambrosio opted to make the mandatory switch into their second cars on the 18th lap. Although the switch would allow di Grassi and d'Ambrosio to gain positions when other drivers made their stops, it required them to conserve electrical energy towards the race's conclusion. The race restarted when the safety car drove into the pit lane on the following lap with López remaining in first place, followed by Heidfeld, Vergne, Bird and Buemi. López built a small lead over {{the rest of the field}} and attention switched to Heidfeld who came under pressure from Vergne, Bird, Buemi and Rosenqvist. Although he had enough electrical energy to do another lap, Vergne became the first of the leading drivers to make a pit stop to switch into his second car at the end of lap 24 in an effort to drive <b>in</b> <b>clean</b> air and undercut the field. The rest of the field followed in response one lap later. Swift work from López's team allowed him to remain narrowly ahead of Vergne, who in turn, moved in front of Heidfeld. The Mahindra driver lost seven positions while Buemi moved from fifth to tenth, both as a result of slow pit stops. Prost led the field for one lap before making his stop on lap 26.|$|E
5|$|Saturday's {{afternoon}} qualifying session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107% of the quickest lap {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in damp weather conditions with intermittent rain. Coulthard achieved his second pole position of the season, his first at the Hockenheimring, with a time of 1:45.697. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Michael Schumacher who was 1.3 seconds slower than Coulthard. Fisichella qualified third, though he was happy with his performance despite using his team's T-car after suffering a spin on his first run. He was later fined $5,000 for not placing his car at the pit-lane weighbridge. Häkkinen qualified fourth, three hundredths of a second slower than Fisichella. Häkkinen later admitted that he was cautious about going off the race track due to the weather conditions. de la Rosa qualified fifth giving Arrows their best qualifying performance of the season. Trulli and Wurz were satisfied with their sixth and seventh place qualifying positions. Herbert in the quicker of the two Jaguars took eighth. Villeneuve secured ninth using his team's spare car after spinning on track which disrupted Frentzen's running. Irvine rounded out the top ten. Verstappen had problems starting his engine, resulting in a lack of qualifying laps but managed to clinch eleventh. Zonta qualified twelfth having used a new engine and could not set a faster lap time after being blocked by Jean Alesi. He was ahead of Alesi's teammate Nick Heidfeld. Ralf Schumacher qualified in 14th, quicker than teammate Button in 16th. They were separated by Salo. Frentzen spent the majority of qualifying 107% outside of the pole sitters time but took 17th; his first quick time was disallowed after cutting the chicane to set a faster lap and to run <b>in</b> <b>clean</b> air. Barrichello used his teammate's car after his developed oil-leak issues and qualified 18th. Sauber's Pedro Diniz took 19th, in front of Alesi in 20th.
