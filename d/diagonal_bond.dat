30|$|In this work, we {{establish}} {{a connection between}} the Poisson’s ratio, a measurable elastic constant [30], and the spring constants used in the atomistic strain simulations, within the framework of linear elasticity theory. At the atomistic level, Poisson’s effect is caused by infinitesimal displacements of atoms thus the stretching of atomistic bonds within the material lattice to accommodate the stress. When the bonds in the stress direction are elongated or compressed, their counterpart in the perpendicular direction will be correspondingly shortened or lengthened. Drawing from the atomistic strain method [26], we considered the lattice bonds as ideal springs, connecting all the neighboring atoms and are within elastic deformation limit upon exerting external force. Our description of the elastic constants has a microscopic interpretation that incorporates all nearest and <b>diagonal</b> <b>bond</b> springs. Under the definition of Hooke’s law, the relationship between stress and responded strain is simply built, resulting in force balance equations, which is vital to formulating the relationship between the Poisson’s ratio and the spring constants.|$|E

The next-nearest neighbour Ising interaction breaks the isotropy in spin space, for a ferromagnetic next-nearest neighbour interaction the system will order antiferromagnetically along the z axis. Antiferromagnetic next-nearest neighbour interactions will lead to frustration, and the system responds with flipping the spins down in the xy plane. For large next nearest neighbour coupling the system will order in a striped phase along the z axis, this phase is reached through a first order transition.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{ground-state}} phase diagram of a Heisenberg model with spin S= 1 / 2 on a diamond-like decorated square lattice. A diamond unit has {{two types of}} antiferromagnetic exchange interactions, and the ratio λ between {{the length of the}} <b>diagonal</b> <b>bond</b> and that of the other four edges determines the strength of frustration. It has been pointed out [J. Phys. Soc. Jpn 85, 033705 (2016) ] that the so-called tetramer-dimer states, which are expected to be stabilized in an intermediate region of λ_ c<λ< 2, are identical to the square-lattice dimer covering states, which ignited renewed interest in high-dimensional diamond-like decorated lattices. In order to determine the phase boundary λ_ c, we employ the modified spin wave method to estimate the energy of the ferrimagnetic state and obtain λ_ c= 0. 974. Our obtained magnetizations for spin- 1 / 2 sites and for spin- 1 sites are m= 0. 398 and m̃= 0. 949, and spin reductions are 20 % and 5 %, respectively. This indicates that spin fluctuation is much smaller than that of the S= 1 / 2 square-lattice antiferromagnet: thus, we can consider that our obtained ground-state energy is highly accurate. Further, our numerical diagonalization study suggests that other cluster states do not appear in the ground-state phase diagram. Comment: 22 pages, 11 figure...|$|E

The classical (s →∞) version of the model has Néel order for 0 < x < x_ cl and a form of spiral order for x_ cl < x < ∞, where x_ cl = 12.

Using transfer matrix calculations, we find in the anisotropic triangular case a succession of different physical phases as the interaction strength is increased: a short range disordered liquid dimer phase at low interactions, then a critical phase similar to the one found for the square lattice, and finally a transition to an ordered columnar phase for large interactions. The existence of the critical phase is in contrast with the belief that criticality for dimer models is ascribed to bipartiteness. For the isotropic triangular case, we have indications that the system undergoes a first order phase transition to an ordered phase, without appearance of an intermediate critical phase.

Most of the previous studies on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice are focusing on the Heisenberg model. Here we opt for the Hubbard model to calculate phase diagrams over a wide range of interaction parameters, and show the competing effects of interaction, frustration and temperature. At low temperature, frustration is shown to favor a paramagnetic metallic ground state, while interaction drives the system to an antiferromagnetic insulator phase. Between these two phases, there are an antiferromagnetic metal phase and a paramagnetic insulator (which should be a valence bond solid) phase resulting from the competition of the frustration and the interaction.

Results from our Monte Carlo simulations show that, phenomenologically, {{the sequence of events}} observed during the collapse are independent of the bond criterion. While the growth of the clusters (of monomers) at different temperatures exhibits a nonuniversal power-law behavior when the bonds are fixed, the introduction of fluctuations in the bonds by considering the existence of <b>diagonal</b> <b>bonds</b> produces a temperature independent growth, which can be described by a universal nonequilibrium finite-size scaling function with a non-universal metric factor.

The classical (s →∞) version of the model has 4 collinear phases when J_ 1 and J_ 2 can take either sign. Three phases are antiferromagnetic (AFM), showing so-called Néel, double Néel and double columnar striped order respectively, while the fourth is ferromagnetic.

A potential energy surface (PES) analysis shows that the radical prefers to pyramidalize anti to the two cis fluorines in the disubstituted cycloalkanes. The degree of pyramidalization for 1, 2 -difluorocyclopropyl radical is 43. 9 o away from the cis fluorines whereas for 1, 3 -difluorocyclobutyl radical, 1, 3 -difluorocyclopentyl radical and 1, 3 -difluorocyclohexyl radical is 3. 8 o, 5. 4 o and 14. 5 o respectively away from the cis fluorines. The importance of this pyramidality effect in these compounds is discussed in context with the carbon-hydrogen bond dissociation energies (BDE's) because the preference of the radical centers to pyramidalize anti to the fluorines affects the bond dissociation energy. Importance of steric effect and unfavorable electronic interactions have been extensively explored in planar permethylated cyclobutadiene (Me 4 CBD) and cyclooctatetraene (Me 8 COT) using ((U) B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G(d) and 6 - 311 +G(2 df, 2 p)) calculations. It is thought that steric interactions dominate electronic interactions in Me 8 COT, while this works opposite in case of Me 4 CBT. Instead, in Me 4 CBD the number of unfavorable electronic interactions between π bonds and out-of-plane hydrogens plays the dominant role in determining the relative energies. Interactions between the π bonds of CBD and the out-of-plane hydrogens on carbons attached to the four-membered ring becomes very interesting when the ring size changes.

Whether the pseudogap is a distinct phenomenon or the incoherent continuation of the superconducting gap above TC {{is one of the}} central questions in high-TC research. While some experimental evidence suggests they are distinct, this issue is still under intense debate.

40|$|The shear {{capacity}} of reinforced concrete pier caps in existing bridge support {{systems can be}} a factor which limits the {{capacity of}} an existing bridge. In their usual configuration, pier caps behave as deep beams and {{have the ability to}} carry load through tied arch action after the formation of <b>diagonal</b> cracks. Externally <b>bonded</b> fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) reinforcement has been shown to increase the shear capacity of reinforced concrete members which carry load through beam action. However, there is an insufficient amount of research to make it a viable strengthening system for beams which carry load through arch action, such as pier caps. Accordingly, this research was aimed at investigating the behavior of reinforced concrete pier caps through a coordinated experimental and analytical program and to recommend an external strengthening method for pier caps with perceived deficiencies in shear strength. The experimental study was performed on laboratory specimens based on an existing bridge in Georgia. A number of factors were examined, including size, percentage longitudinal reinforcement and crack control reinforcement. The results showed that increasing the longitudinal tension reinforcement increased the beam capacity by changing the shape of the tied arch. In contrast, the presence of crack control reinforcement did not change the point at which diagonal cracking occurred, but it did increase the ultimate capacity by reinforcing the concrete against splitting. The results of the experimental study were used in conjunction with a larger database to examine different analytical methods for estimating the ultimate capacity of deep beams, and a new method was developed for the design of external strengthening. Two specimens were tested with externally bonded FRP reinforcement applied longitudinally to increase the strength of the tension tie. The test results correlated well with the proposed method of analysis and showed that increasing the strength of the longitudinal tension tie is an effective way to increase the strength of a reinforced concrete deep beam.

In planning the structure of the calculation, the longitudinal girder using WF profile (300 x 200 x 8 x 12) mm, the transverse beam profile using the profile of WF (400 x 400 x 20 x 35) mm, the main girder using WF profile (400 x 400 x 16 x 24) mm. Institute of winds above using a double elbow profile 80. 80. 8 mm. For the portal end use profiles WF (400 x 400 x 18 x 28) mm, WF (250 x 125 x 6 x 9) mm. For <b>diagonal</b> wind on <b>bond</b> under the profile of 80. 80. 8 mm double elbow. At the bottom structural design (abutment and pillars) are planned with the quality of 30 Mpa, abutment dimensions are planned with a width of 4. 5 m length 10 m, height of 6. 5 m. While the pier has a dimension of 8 m width, length 11 m, height of 13. 3 m. For the safety factor between the abutment and the pier is taken equal to 1. 5. To obtain security against the rolling abutment of 1. 61, the shear of 1. 83, while for the pier to bolster security obtained as 1. 54, the shear of 3. 47. The foundation for the abutment using a diameter of 45 cm obtained 8 Ø 12 reinforcement...|$|R
