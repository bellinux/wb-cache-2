5|$|Although {{opened in}} 1800 {{at the cost}} of £100,000, the new harbour at Grimsby failed to attract the levels of trade the company had projected, caused largely by a lack of inland {{transport}} networks. The financial problems facing the Grimsby Haven Company led to factions and difficulty in its running and put strain on Boucherett's relations with Yarborough; having invested much money and time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>now</b> failing company, Boucherett also found it draining of him financially.|$|E

Gordon is promoted to Lieutenant of the Gotham City Police Department, shows Batman the Bat-Signal, and mentions a criminal who leaves Joker playing cards at crime scenes.

5|$|Coke became {{involved}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>now</b> classic Shelley's Case in 1581, which created a rule in real property {{that is still}} used in some common law jurisdictions today; the case also established Coke's reputation as an attorney and case reporter. His next famous case was Chudleigh's Case, a dispute over {{the interpretation of the}} Statute of Uses, followed by Slade's Case, a dispute between the Common Pleas and King's Bench over assumpsit now regarded as a classic example of the friction between the two courts and the forward movement of contract law; Coke's argument in Slade's Case formed the first definition of consideration.|$|E
5|$|During the ceremony, the AMPAS {{presented}} Academy Awards, {{now known}} as the Oscars in twelve categories. Winners were announced three months before the live event. Some nominations were announced without reference to a specific film, such as for Ralph Hammeras and Nugent Slaughter, who received nominations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>now</b> defunct category of Engineering Effects. Unlike later ceremonies, an actor could be awarded for multiple works within a calendar year for the same category. Emil Jannings, for example, was given the Best Actor award for his work in both The Way of All Flesh and The Last Command. Moreover, Charlie Chaplin and Warner Brothers each received an Honorary Award.|$|E
5|$|Following the December 1983 {{release of}} the first album <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Now</b> That's What I Call Music series, {{compilation}} albums featuring various artists became very popular in the UK during {{the mid to late}} 1980s; this is reflected in the albums that were Christmas number one during this time. From 1983 to 1987, every album {{at the top of the}} Christmas chart was a various artists compilation album, from either the Now That's What I Call Music or the Hits series. The UK Albums Chart was subsequently altered so that, from 14 January 1989, releases from various artists were no longer eligible for the main album chart.|$|E

5|$|Mary is {{presented}} as a Marian apparition; in this case she probably appears before a donor, who would have been kneeling in prayer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>now</b> lost opposite panel. The idea of a saint appearing before laity was common in Northern art of the period, and is also represented in van Eyck's Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele (1434–36). There, the Canon is portrayed as if having just momentarily paused to reflect on a passage from his hand-held bible as the Virgin and Child with two saints appear before him, as if embodiments of his prayer.|$|E
5|$|On February 26, 2010, Butler {{traveled}} to Valparaiso for their regular season finale. Leading scorer Gordon Hayward was sidelined with lower back pain, {{but the team}} still won 74–69. In so doing, Stevens broke the coaching record he had tied the prior week and Butler completed an 18–0 undefeated conference schedule. It was Butler's first undefeated conference record since joining the Horizon League, and first since Joe Sexson led the 1978 team to a 6–0 record <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>now</b> defunct Indiana Collegiate Conference. Stevens earned his third straight regular-season conference championship.|$|E
5|$|Puthiya Paravai was {{released}} on 12 September 1964. It was originally slated {{to be released in}} the theatre Shanthi, which is Sivaji Ganesan's family-held theatre. However, the Hindi film Sangam was already running there successfully, so Ganesan instead released <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>now</b> non-existent theatre Paragon at Wallajah Road, which had to be refurbished before the film's screening. It was Sangams lead actor, Raj Kapoor, who requested Ganesan to allow his film to continue running at Shanti, to which Ganesan obliged. The film was later dubbed in Telugu as Singapore CID.|$|E

5|$|The {{uplifting}} {{and increased}} erosion exposed granitic {{rocks in the}} area to surface pressures, resulting in exfoliation (responsible for the rounded shape of the many domes in the park) and mass wasting following the numerous fracture joint planes (cracks; especially vertical ones) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>now</b> solidified plutons. Pleistocene glaciers further accelerated this process and the larger ones transported the resulting talus and till from valley floors.|$|E

5|$|Apart from Rayalavari Karunakruthyamu, Krishnasastri's script {{also took}} {{inspiration}} from Devan Sharar's short story, The Emperor and the Slave Girl, {{which was published}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>now</b> defunct magazine, The Illustrated Weekly of India. It was Narasimha Reddy's practice to credit the authors of works from which he borrowed the basic premise for a film, but in this film, {{that was not the}} case. Krishnasastry revealed the fact in an interview with Vijayachitra magazine after Narasimha Reddy's death in 1977. However, in the film's opening credits, Buchibabu was listed as the film's writer along with Krishnasastri. Adi M. Irani and B.N. Konda Reddy were the film's cinematographers; S. Rajeswara Rao and Addepalli Ramarao composed the film's music; H.R. Narayana and Vasu edited the film. A.K. Shekhar was the film's production designer and Thota Tharani father Thota Venkateswara Rao assisted him.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, the U.S. House of Representatives, {{under the}} urging of Scranton native, Representative Joseph M. McDade, voted to approve the {{spending}} of $8 million to study the collection and {{to begin the process}} of making it a National Historic Site. By 1995, Steamtown was acquired and developed by the National Park Service (NPS) at a total cost of $66 million, and opened as Steamtown National Historic Site the same year. In preparation for its acquisition of the collection, the NPS had conducted historical research during 1987 and 1988 on the equipment that still remained in the foundation's possession. This research was used for a Scope of Collections Statement for Steamtown National Historic Site and was published in 1991 under the title Steamtown Special History Study. Aside from providing concise histories of the equipment, the report also made recommendations as to whether or not each piece belonged <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>now</b> government-funded collection. Historical significance to the United States was a criterion of the recommendations. Many of the pieces of equipment that did not meet the report's recommendations were sold or traded for pieces that had historical significance to the DL grounds on which the site is located.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1942, the H-11, based on the H-3 was introduced. With the H-11, the Luftwaffe had at its {{disposal}} a powerful medium bomber with heavier armour and revised defensive armament. The drum-fed 7.92mm (.312in) MG 15 was replaced with a belt-fed 13mm (.51in) MG 131 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>now</b> fully enclosed dorsal position (B-Stand); the gunner in the latter was now protected with armoured glass. The single MG 15 in the ventral C-Stand or Bola was also replaced, with a belt-fed 7.92mm (.312in) MG 81Z with much higher rate of fire. The beam positions originally retained the single MG 15s, but the H-11/R1 replaced these with twin MG 81Z as well; this latter arrangement was standardized in November 1942. The port internal ESAC bomb racks could be removed, and an 835L (221US gal) fuel tanks installed in its place. Many H-11s were equipped with a new PVC rack under the fuselage, which carried five 250kg (550lb) bombs. Additional armour plating was fitted around crew spaces, some {{of it on the}} lower fuselage and could be jettisoned in an emergency. Engines were two 1,000kW (1,340hp) Junkers Jumo 211F-2, allowing this variant to carry a 2,000kg (4,410lb) payload to a range of 2,340km (1,450mi). Heinkel built 230 new aircraft of this type and converted 100 H-3s to H-11s by {{the summer of}} 1943.|$|E
