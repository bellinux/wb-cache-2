50|$|Sufficient safety {{margins are}} to be {{included}} in order to account for any mismatch between the delay line(critical path monitor) and the actual critical path in order to account for the large within-die process variations that are inevitable.These large variations can cause the critical path to change from one process corner to other.Thus in order to maintain a <b>fail</b> <b>safe</b> <b>operation,</b> an additional delay margin is to be maintained.This margin is translated into voltage overhead that directly reduces the energy savings associated with the AVS approach. The process and temperature variations of the closed loop systems are compensated by continuously monitoring the activity of critical path replica.Nevertheless, in the sub-micrometer technologies the use of a single reference in the critical path is becoming less feasible.As the transistor dimensions are scaled, selection of a unique critical path across all conditions becomes very challenging.This is because of the increased variations of transistor and wires with the progress of technology node.Also when the contribution of interconnect delay increases, there might be several paths that have different combinations of logic and interconnect delay with their overall delays being close to each other.In that case the selection of critical path becomes even more challenging.|$|E

40|$|Modern CPUs with {{increasing}} core frequency and power are rapidly reaching {{a point that}} the CPU frequency and performance are limited {{by the amount of}} heat that can be extracted by the cooling technology. In mobile environment, this issue is becoming more apparent, as form factors become thinner and lighter. Often, mobile platforms trade CPU performance in order to reduce power and manage the box thermals. Most of today's high performance CPUs provide thermal sensor on the die to allow thermal management, typically in the form of analog thermal diode. Operating system algorithms and platform embedded controllers read the temperature and control the processor power. In addition to full temperature reading, some products implement digital sensors with fixed temperature threshold, intended for <b>fail</b> <b>safe</b> <b>operation.</b> Temperature measurements using the diode suffer some inherent inaccuracies : ? Measurement accuracy - An external device connects to the diode and performs the A/D conversion. The combination of diode behavior, electrical noise and conversion accuracy result with measurement error ? Distance to the die hot spot - Due to routing restrictions, the diode is not placed at the hottest spot on the die. The temperature difference between the diode and the hot spot varies with the workload and the reported temperature dose not accurately represent the die max temperature. This offset is increasing as power density of the CPU increase. multiple core CPUs introduce harder problem to address as the workload and the thermal distribution changes with the different active cores. ? Manufacturing temperature accuracy - Inaccuracies in the test environment induce additional temperature inaccuracy between the measured temperature vs. the actual temperature. As a result to these effects, the thermal control algorithm requires to add temperature guard bend to account for the control feedback errors. These impact the performance and reliability of the silicon. In order to address the thermal control issues, the Intel® CoreTM Duo has introduced a new digital temperature reading capability on die. Multiple thermal sensors are distributed on the die on different possible hot spots. An A/D logic built around these sensors translates the temperature into a digital value, accessible to operating system thermal control S/W, or driver based control mechanism. Providing high accuracy temperature reading requires a calibration process. During high volume manufacturing, each sensor is calibrated to provide good accuracy and linearity. The die specification and reliability limitation is defined by the hottest spot on the die. In addition the calibration of the sensor is done at the same test conditions as the specification testing. Any test control inaccuracy is eliminated because the part is guaranteed to meet specifications at max temperature, as measured by the digital thermometer. As a result, the use of integrated thermal sensor enables improved reliability and performance at high workloads while meeting specifications at ant time. In this paper we will present the implementation and calibration details of the digital thermometer. We will show some studies of the temperature distribution on die and compare traditional diode based measurement to the digital sensor implementation...|$|E

40|$|The savings {{associated}} with operations optimization of power generation and cogeneration facilities are large, and readily justify the {{hardware and software}} costs required for implementation of Energy Management Optimization Systems (EMOS). The objective of such systems is to minimize the total energy operating costs for specified power and steam load profiles, including the purchase of external power and/or steam, {{and the use of}} internal self-generation equipment. The EMOS may require online operation using current measurements (e. g. flow, powers, temperatures, etc.), and calculating optimum energy purchase and equipment dispatch within time periods consistent with changing ambients, loads and/or purchase energy price conditions. The automatic recognition of changes in equipment status and system operating configuration may be required. The EMOS may also consider the electrical distribution system to minimize losses, and to ensure that tbe optimum thermal power dispatch may be reliably delivered to the loads under tbe existing distribution configuration within electrical equipment operating limits. Automatic generation dispatch may also be required. A system which incorporates the requirements of the above specification and more, has been designed, installed and is operational at a large industrial cogeneration facility. A description of the specifics of this entire system is beyond tbe scope of this paper, however, a discussion of selected system features will be given. This application involves the simultaneous optimization of energy supply for in-plant power and process steam from many highly integrated system components. Cogeneration plants, as shown in Figure 1, are generally characterized by multiple sources of energy, various types of prime movers (e. g. boilers, waste heat recovery, steam and gas turbines, etc.), and varying requirements for process heat and electrical power, particularly if bulk power is being purchased, or dispatched to a utility grid {{as in the case of}} Independent Power Producers. In addition, the operating characteristics of tbe equipment and loads are continuously changing due to outage of equipment, changes in process steam and electrical demands, ambient conditions and performance deterioration. The ability to coordinate and optimize the simultaneous operation of the various components to meet all the energy requirements at minimum cost is a formidable task. In addition to the thermal optimization of boilers, gas turbines, and various types of condensing and autoextraction steam turbines, the system also considers the electrical distribution system, where changing bus configurations, power and voltage control impose additional constraints and limits which are solved in the optimum dispatch. The application incorporates automatic closed loop control of many process set points with a sophisticated system of permissives and automatic generation control features. Since a high on-line operating factor is essential, many design features are incorporated for signal validation and malfunction identification, and to make the system robust to instrument failure and drift. The system can be used as an on-line or off-line supervisory program. For on line implementation, closed loop response, <b>fail</b> <b>safe</b> <b>operation</b> and interfacing with process control systems are key closed loop implementation considerations. The system involves the interaction of several modules. The following will describe selected modules and how they interface to satisfy existing loads at minimum cost...|$|E
40|$|Multilevel {{converters}} {{can reach}} medium-voltage operation increasing {{the efficiency of}} high-power applications. Among the available multilevel converter topologies, the invention of Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC) has gained considerable attention of academia and industry in recent times. There are attractive advantages of this converter in terms of modularity, high-quality waveforms, low device rating, fault tolerant capacity and voltage scalability. Moreover, the main advantage compared to cascaded multilevel converters {{is the lack of}} an input transformer which results in a reduction of cooling requirements, size, and cost. The converter concept has already been introduced in the market for high voltage dc transmission (HVDC) applications. A considerable research is going on presently for using this topology for dc-ac power conversion e. g. for ac drives. The main focus of this research work will be based on identifying and solving some of the challenges of medium and high voltage converters for drives and power grid. Reliability and <b>fail</b> <b>safe</b> <b>operation</b> of these converters are primary requirements. Apart from this, condition monitoring and health diagnosis of the converter including the load is also essential. This thesis studies mathematical models to predict the behaviour of the converter under steady state and dynamic conditions. The obtained models can be useful to know the transient response inside the converter during faulty conditions and make it possible to design the components for this converter for abnormal operations. Exploring the fault operation of cells and bypassing in case of a fault have been investigated by simulation and laboratory experiments. Moreover, in MMC, there is a strong harmonic content in the arm current that essentially controls the dynamic behavior of the converter. In this project an explicit derivation of the equations in the frequency domain has been developed based on the switching functions concept. The salient features of this analysis are (i), how the second order harmonic in the circulating current influences capacitor voltage ripples, and (ii) to find the most critical parameters related to capacitor voltage fluctuations. Pulse width modulation techniques are widely employed for the synthesis of ac voltages at the terminals of a voltage sourced converters. The new level-shifted PWM method presented in the thesis offers reduced switching frequency of the cells, no need to calculate the duty cycles based on the reference waveforms as well as easy real-time implementation in a DSP. This research also contributes toward introducing circuit arrangements to start-up the converter from a de-energized condition without adding auxiliary voltage source. Some modification in the existing circuitry for dc-ac power conversion is also explored where a transformer has been introduced inside the MMC. The proposed circuit helps to reduce the voltage rating of the power devices and the capacitors to half when compared to the conventional MMC. Additionally, the transformer also helps in limiting the circulating current. An improved decoupling current controller is proposed that seeks to tackle some drawbacks of the conventional d-q current controller, while keeping the successful reference tracking and disturbance rejection. One of the specified objectives of this work is to develop and implement an efficient and robust capacitor voltage observer. The observer will work as a software sensor working in parallel with the hardware measurement part. It could be used for condition monitoring for capacitors, predictive control, fault detection and parameter estimation. All concepts and proposed approaches in this thesis have been analyzed and validated through simulations and experimental results, as relevant issues are discussed. Finally, this thesis addresses the software and hardware design of two laboratory setups for four-level MMC-based inverter as part of a project. These setups can be used effectively to test the above mentioned ideas as well as enable them for future practical use. The control circuit will be built based on DSP and FPGA platforms which are utilized to produce the gate control signals...|$|E
