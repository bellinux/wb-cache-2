2500|$|The county's {{most common}} winter bird is the lesser scaup, a <b>diving</b> <b>duck.</b> In 2008, {{half a million}} were counted. In 2010, 15,000 were estimated. Local bird counts {{indicate}} that {{there are at least}} 163 species of birds in the county. Other birds include the red-shouldered hawk, the loggerhead shrike, the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker, Cooper's hawks, pileated woodpeckers, Savannah sparrows, [...] rails (which also includes coots), Florida scrub jays (an endangered species), wood storks, grackles, great horned owls, northern mockingbirds, brown thrashers, catbirds, green-winged teals, greater yellowlegs, western sandpipers, least sandpipers, dowitchers, and American white pelicans. [...] Peak migration in the fall is from the last week in September through the first week in October. Fall migration tends to be stronger than spring because birds typically take different flyways.|$|E
2500|$|Subfamily: Anatinae, dabbling {{ducks and}} moa-nalos (The dabbling duck group, of {{worldwide}} distribution, were previously restricted {{to just one}} or two genera, but had been extended to include eight extant genera and about 55 living species, including several genera formerly known as the [...] "perching ducks"; mtDNA on the other hand confirms that the genus Anas is over-lumped and casts doubt on the <b>diving</b> <b>duck</b> affiliations of several genera [...] The moa-nalos, of which four species in three genera are known to date, are a peculiar group of flightless, extinct anatids from the Hawaiian Islands. Gigantic in size and with massive bills, they were believed to be geese, but {{have been shown to be}} actually very closely related to mallards. They evolved filling the ecological niche of turtles, ungulates, and other megaherbivores.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diving</b> <b>ducks</b> and sea ducks forage deep underwater. To {{be able to}} {{submerge}} more easily, the <b>diving</b> <b>ducks</b> are {{heavier than}} dabbling ducks, and therefore have more difficulty taking off to fly.|$|R
5000|$|Netta is a genus of <b>diving</b> <b>ducks.</b> The name {{is derived}} from Greek Netta [...] "duck". Unlike other <b>diving</b> <b>ducks,</b> the Netta species are {{reluctant}} to dive, and feed more like dabbling ducks.|$|R
2500|$|Subfamily: Aythyinae, <b>diving</b> <b>ducks</b> (Some 15 {{species of}} <b>diving</b> <b>ducks,</b> of {{worldwide}} distribution, {{in two to}} four genera; The 1986 morphological analysis suggested the probably extinct pink-headed duck of India, previously treated separately in Rhodonessa, should be placed in Netta, but this has been questioned. Furthermore, while morphologically close to dabbling ducks, the mtDNA data indicate a treatment as distinct subfamily is indeed correct, with the Tadorninae being actually closer to dabbling <b>ducks</b> than the <b>diving</b> <b>ducks)</b> ...|$|R

50|$|The <b>diving</b> <b>ducks</b> {{are placed}} in a {{distinct}} subfamily, Aythyinae. While morphologically close to the dabbling ducks, there are nonetheless some pronounced differences {{such as in the}} structure of the trachea. mtDNA cytochrome b and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 sequence data indicate that the dabbling and <b>diving</b> <b>ducks</b> are fairly distant from each other, the outward similarities being due to convergent evolution.Alternatively, the <b>diving</b> <b>ducks</b> are placed as a tribe Aythyini in a subfamily Anatidae which would encompass all duck-like birds except the whistling-ducks.The seaducks commonly found in coastal areas, such as the long-tailed duck (formerly known in the US as oldsquaw), scoters, goldeneyes, mergansers, bufflehead and eiders, are also sometimes colloquially referred to in North America as <b>diving</b> <b>ducks</b> because they also feed by diving; their subfamily (Merginae) is a very distinct one however.|$|R
50|$|Another {{distinguishing}} {{characteristic of}} puddle ducks {{when compared to}} <b>diving</b> <b>ducks</b> {{is the way in}} which they take flight when spooked or are on the move. Puddle ducks spring straight up from the water, but <b>diving</b> <b>ducks</b> need to gain momentum to take off, so they must run across the water a short distance to gain flight.|$|R

The female is mainly a pale brown, with a darker back and crown and a whitish face. Eclipse males are like females but with red bills. They are gregarious birds, forming large flocks in winter, often mixed with other <b>diving</b> <b>ducks,</b> such as common pochards. They feed mainly by diving or dabbling.
