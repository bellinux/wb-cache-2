5|$|In 1946, former Chicago White Sox {{teammate}} Ted Lyons was the {{new manager}} of the White Sox, and offered Berg a coaching position. Berg declined. Boston Red Sox owner Thomas Yawkey, who was much closer to Berg when he played for the Red Sox, matched Lyons' offer, but Berg still turned them down.

50|$|Both lines {{consist of}} {{an equal number}} of pieces (2 pieces each), and {{therefore}} rule (i) <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>apply.</b> There is only one capturing piece involved, and therefore rule (ii) <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>apply.</b> The highest piece in both capturing lines is a Damas, and therefore rule (iii) <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>apply.</b> Each capturing line has the same number of Damas (only 1 each), and therefore rule (iv) <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>apply.</b> The next highest piece on both capturing line is a Pedine, and therefore rule (v) <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>apply.</b> Each capturing line has the same number of Pedines (only 1 each), and therefore rule (vi) <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>apply.</b> A decision cannot be made yet based on the first six rules, and therefore, rule (vii) applies, and the player is free to choose either Line A or Line B to capture.|$|R

The relief sculptures decorating the Ara Pacis visually augmented the written record of Augustus' triumphs in the Res Gestae. Its reliefs depicted the imperial pageants of the praetorians, the Vestals, and the citizenry of Rome.|$|E

5|$|As for the BIA's assurance, the Court {{that only}} {{meant that the}} {{termination}} act did not terminate the claim, not that {{the statute of limitations}} would not begin to run. Because the Court of Appeals had only held that the statute of limitation <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>apply,</b> not that it would not bar the claim if it applied, and the District Court had held the claim barred, the Court remanded to the Court of Appeals to pass on that conclusion of the District Court.|$|E

Harvey suggested that they were pressured by the Castilians across the border, but historian Trevor Dadson argued that this conversion was unforced, caused instead by centuries of contact with their Christian neighbors and a desire for an equal status with the Christians.|$|E

5|$|The Supreme Court of the United States issued {{almost no}} {{constitutional}} criminal procedure decisions {{for its first}} century of existence. Professor Akhil Amar highlights two reasons for this. First, the Court's decision in Barron v. Baltimore (1833) meant that the federal constitution <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>apply</b> in state proceedings until the incorporation of the Bill of Rights after the Fourteenth Amendment. Second, the Court lacked general appellate jurisdiction over federal criminal cases until 1891.|$|E
5|$|As the war {{drew to a}} close, Lincoln's presidential Reconstruction for the South was in flux; having {{believed}} {{the federal government had}} limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen. He signed into law Senator Charles Sumner's Freedmen's Bureau bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate material needs of former slaves. The law assigned land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen. Lincoln stated that his Louisiana plan <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>apply</b> to all states under Reconstruction. Shortly before his assassination, Lincoln announced he had a new plan for southern Reconstruction. Discussions with his cabinet revealed Lincoln planned short-term military control over southern states, until readmission under the control of southern Unionists.|$|E
5|$|By {{contrast}} Yoshiaki Itakura {{adopted an}} even stricter standard than Hata, advocating that only Chinese soldiers captured in uniform and then killed be included as massacre victims. He argued that Chinese {{soldiers who had}} thrown away their uniforms were legally executed because {{the laws of war}} at the time <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>apply</b> to them, though this line of reasoning is hotly disputed by other historians. Most Japanese ultranationalists who deny the Nanking Massacre admit that the Japanese Army killed a large number of Chinese POWs, though they consider these to be legal executions, an argument denounced by mainstream historians.|$|E

5|$|Certain {{types of}} {{learning}} are possible, respective to each applicable type of learning, only within a limited age range {{known as a}} critical period. Bowlby's concepts included the idea that attachment involved learning from experience during a limited age period, influenced by adult behaviour. He <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>apply</b> the imprinting concept in its entirety to human attachment. However, he considered that attachment behaviour was best explained as instinctive, combined with the effect of experience, stressing the readiness the child brings to social interactions. Over time it became apparent there were more differences than similarities between attachment theory and imprinting so the analogy was dropped.|$|E

5|$|In September 1914, Lord Kitchener {{announced}} that he was looking for volunteers and regular NCOs to provide officers for the expanding army. Most of the volunteers came from the middle class, with the largest group from commercial and clerical occupations (27%), followed by teachers and students (18%) and professional men (15%). In March 1915, it was discovered that 12,290 men serving in the ranks had been members of a university or public school Officers' Training Corps (OTC). Most applied for and were granted commissions, while others who <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>apply</b> were also commissioned.

5|$|On August 12, 1867, {{during a}} Senate recess, President Johnson {{suspended}} Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, a Lincoln appointee who sympathized with Congressional Reconstruction. To keep Grant under control {{as a potential}} political rival, Johnson asked {{him to take the}} post. Grant recommended against the move, in light of the Tenure of Office Act, which required Senate approval for cabinet removals. Johnson believed the Act <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>apply</b> to officers appointed by the previous president and forced the issue by making Grant an interim appointee on the same day. Grant agreed to accept the post temporarily, and Stanton vacated the office until the Senate reconvened.|$|E

He explained that this <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>apply</b> to Eiland-Hall's website {{even if it was}} knowingly inaccurate, because the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Hustler Magazine v.

5|$|The {{military}} {{leaders of the}} National Reorganization Process, convicted in the 1985 Trial of the Juntas, received presidential pardons, despite popular opposition to them.

The colonel, Mohamed Alí Seineldín, who was also pardoned, started a new mutiny, killing two military men. Unlike the mutinies that {{took place during the}} presidency of Alfonsín, the military fully obeyed Menem's orders for a forceful repression. Seineldín was utterly defeated, and sentenced to life imprisonment. This was the last military mutiny in Argentina.|$|E
