25|$|The {{questioning}} {{does not}} have to be explicit to trigger Miranda rights. For example, two police officers engaging in a conversation designed to elicit an <b>incriminating</b> <b>statement</b> from a suspect would constitute questioning. A person may choose to waive his Miranda rights, but the prosecution has the burden of showing that such a waiver was actually made.|$|E
2500|$|Patrice Seibert, {{a suspect}} in a fatal arson, was arrested and taken to the police station. [...] There, a police officer decided to {{interrogate}} her using a method he had been taught: to question the suspect, obtain a confession, then give Miranda warnings and repeat the questioning until the confession was obtained again. [...] Accordingly, Seibert was not informed of her Miranda rights before the interrogation began. [...] After about 40 minutes of questioning, Seibert made an <b>incriminating</b> <b>statement.</b> [...] She was given a 20-minute break. [...] When the questioning resumed, she was given her Miranda warnings, and reminded {{of what she had}} admitted before the break. [...] She then repeated her confession.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the next}} few months, Weinberg and Scozzari {{recorded}} over 100 tapes of <b>incriminating</b> <b>statements</b> from Cantarella and his crew. While Cantarella broke off contact with Weinberg {{in the fall of}} 2001, he continued talking freely with Scozzari well into the summer of 2002--presumably because Scozzari was Italian. While talking with Scozzari, Cantarella made several <b>incriminating</b> <b>statements</b> about Massino.|$|R
50|$|<b>Incriminating</b> <b>statements</b> were {{extracted}} under torture. Nevertheless, Hazbiu and Feçor Shehu {{could not}} be forced to admit the absurd accusations. Several defendants were executed, the others sentenced to long prison terms.|$|R
50|$|Amnesty International {{expressed}} concern that Ranisavljević had been made a scapegoat and that the trial was a token affair. It was alleged that Ranisavljević had been tortured in detention {{to force him to}} make <b>incriminating</b> <b>statements.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Once an {{insurance}} company's fraud investigation department {{is assigned to}} investigate a fraud claim, they will frequently proceed with the investigation in two stages: pre-contact and post-contact. [...] The first, pre-contact stage involves analyzing all available evidence before the suspect is contacted. [...] This may involve reviewing paperwork submitted, reaching out to third parities, and gathering evidence from available sources. [...] The second stage, [...] "post-contact," [...] involves initiating contact with the suspect to gather more information and, ideally, obtain an <b>incriminating</b> <b>statement.</b> [...] Insurance fraud investigators are trained to question the suspect {{in a manner that}} would preclude the possibility of the suspect raising a valid defense at a later time. For example, questions about access to claim forms would preclude the defense that another individual filled out the fraudulent documents. [...] Common defenses that may be precluded by the suspect interview include, for example, that the suspect lacked knowledge that his or her statement was false, lacked the intention to defraud another individual, or made an ambiguous statement that was later interpreted incorrectly. [...] Full disclosure may add credibility to a suspect's account of events, but omissions from disclosure or false statements may detract from the suspect's credibility in later interviews or proceedings.|$|E
2500|$|Simpson made an <b>incriminating</b> <b>statement</b> {{to police}} about cutting his finger {{the night of}} the murders. First {{he said that he had}} accidentally cut his finger with a shard of broken glass in his Chicago hotel room, then changed his story minutes later. He said he cut his finger in Los Angeles, then said that the cut re-opened while he was in Chicago. Later he claimed not to {{remember}} at all how he received the cut on his left middle finger. Bugliosi took Clark and Darden to task for not allowing the jury to hear the police audio tape of this statement. Bugliosi also said the prosecutors should have gone into more detail about Simpson's abuse of his wife. He said it should have been made clear to the mostly African-American jury that Simpson had little influence in the black community. Unlike some other prominent athletes, he had done nothing to help blacks less fortunate than he. Bugliosi pointed out that, although the prosecutors understood that Simpson's race had nothing to do with the murders, once the defense [...] "opened the door" [...] by trying to paint Simpson falsely as a leader in the black community who might have been framed by an overzealous prosecution looking for a suspect, the prosecution should have presented the evidence to the contrary. This might have influenced the jury's verdict. Bugliosi also criticized the prosecution's closing statements as inadequate.|$|E

5000|$|In 2008, Brendan [...] "Bik" [...] McFarlane {{was charged}} with the false {{imprisonment}} of Tidey. The trial collapsed after <b>incriminating</b> <b>statements</b> he allegedly made following his arrest were ruled inadmissible. No-one was ever convicted of the soldier's killing.|$|R
50|$|According to the Innocence Project, about 25 {{percent of}} wrongfully convicted {{innocent}} people were coerced into making false confessions or false <b>incriminating</b> <b>statements.</b> Most {{of the victims}} were threatened by the terror of harsher sentences if they remained non-compliant.|$|R
5000|$|Justice Potter Stewart's {{majority}} opinion, however, {{contained a}} footnote {{suggesting that the}} evidence provided by Williams could still be constitutionally used in a trial:While neither Williams’ <b>incriminating</b> <b>statements</b> themselves nor any testimony describing his having led the police to the victim’s body can constitutionally be admitted into evidence, evidence of where the body was found and of its condition might well be admissible {{on the theory that}} the body would have been discovered in any event, even had <b>incriminating</b> <b>statements</b> not been elicited from Williams. ... In the event that a retrial is instituted, it will be for the state courts in the first instance to determine whether particular items of evidence may be admitted.|$|R

50|$|In June 2011 {{a federal}} Judge {{ruled that the}} Obama {{administration}} can not use certain statements Sharqawi gave to justify his detention because {{the government did not}} rebut claims of torture in Jordan and Afghanistan.

50|$|The {{cases were}} {{investigated}} by the Union County—Chesterfield County (South Carolina) Homicide Task Force, South Carolina State Law Enforcement Division, the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation, and the FBI.

5000|$|An <b>incriminating</b> <b>statement</b> {{includes}} any {{statement that}} tends to increase the danger that the person making the statement will be accused, charged or prosecuted - even if the statement is true, {{and even if the}} person is innocent of any crime. Thus, even a person who is innocent of any crime who testifies truthfully can be incriminated by that testimony. The United States Supreme Court has stated that the Fifth Amendment privilege: ...|$|E
50|$|The fact {{pattern in}} this case is similar to that in Brewer v. Williams, , where police used their {{knowledge}} of Williams's deep religious beliefs to elicit an <b>incriminating</b> <b>statement</b> despite not formally questioning Williams. However, in Brewer, the state had already initiated formal judicial proceedings by obtaining an arrest warrant and arraigning Williams, thus triggering the protections of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel under the Massiah doctrine. By contrast, Innis was decided under the Fifth Amendment, since formal proceedings had not commenced.|$|E
50|$|Walsingham {{tracked down}} Catholic priests in England and {{supposed}} conspirators by employing informers, and intercepting correspondence. Shortly before setting off for England, Edmund Campion {{learned that a}} letter detailing their party and mission had been intercepted {{and that they were}} expected in England. It was a common practice for a spy to pose as a Catholic and engage a suspect in conversation in the hope of eliciting an <b>incriminating</b> <b>statement.</b> This technique led to the arrest and execution of Richard Simpson in 1588.|$|E
50|$|Serbian {{police arrested}} {{two members of}} a {{paramilitary}} unit called the Scorpions, Saša Cvjetan and Dejan Demirović, who freely gave <b>incriminating</b> <b>statements</b> and signed them.

50|$|The TCCA, and the {{district}} court, had been mistaken in applying McNeil and cases that followed it to Perry's case, Keith wrote. Rather, Massiah and Moulton, since they both involved attempts to surreptitiously elicit <b>incriminating</b> <b>statements</b> from defendants already charged, were controlling. And Bender offered the closest set of facts to Perry's case.|$|R
5000|$|At his trial, the State {{presented}} evidence, including {{testimony from}} Steady's wife, that Steady B, Cool C, and Canty met at Steady's apartment {{shortly after the}} robbery, where they watched {{media coverage of the}} event on television, and discussed their escape. [...] <b>Incriminating</b> <b>statements</b> by Canty were also admitted into evidence at Steady's trial.|$|R
5000|$|Witnesses at {{the trial}} testified that Dula made the <b>incriminating</b> <b>statement</b> {{he was going to}} [...] "do in" [...] the one who gave him [...] "the pock" [...] (syphilis). Their {{testimony}} suggested that Dula believed Laura had given him syphilis, which he had passed on to Anne. However, the local doctor testified he had treated both Dula and Anne for syphilis with blue mass, as he also had Pauline Foster, who in fact was the first to be treated. Many believe that Dula caught the disease from Pauline Foster, then passed it on to both Anne and Laura.|$|E

50|$|Once {{judicial}} proceedings begin (here, the arraignment in Davenport, Iowa), the Sixth Amendment dictates that a suspect {{has the right}} to counsel. This right attaches automatically, and the prosecution has the burden of showing the defendant waived this right. The majority opinion found that the officer exploited the suspect’s deep religious convictions to obtain an <b>incriminating</b> <b>statement</b> in violation of the suspect's Sixth Amendment right to counsel. The Davenport judge arraigned Williams on his outstanding arrest warrant, thus {{judicial proceedings}} were underway. Despite Williams's insistence on his right to counsel, the officer obtained incriminating statements without informing Williams of his right to have counsel present and his ability to waive that right.|$|E
50|$|McCowen {{had lived}} on Cape Cod since about 1998 {{and had been}} a garbage {{collector}} whose regular route included Worthington's home. McCowen was charged {{on the basis of}} genetic fingerprinting and <b>incriminating</b> <b>statements</b> he made during a police interview. On November 16, 2006, he was convicted of first-degree murder, aggravated rape, and aggravated armed burglary. He was sentenced to life without parole.|$|R
50|$|Lord Castlehaven denied {{all charges}} and claimed {{his wife and}} son were conspiring against him. He called his wife a whore to whose {{statements}} no value should be attached, and accused her of having given birth to an illegitimate child during their marriage. The servants who had made <b>incriminating</b> <b>statements</b> against him had done so out of spite and jealousy.|$|R
5000|$|Commenting on this issue, the American Civil Liberties Union {{pointed to}} Brownback's {{decision}} {{to wait until}} the Prosecution complied with his order to make public Khadr's detention records—which may have substantiated his claims his <b>incriminating</b> <b>statements</b> were the product of abuse. They wrote the Pentagon [...] "is unwilling to let judges exercise independence if it means a ruling against the government." ...|$|R
50|$|Clarence Elkins {{settled with}} the state of Ohio for US$1.075 million. He later filed a civil suit against the Barberton police for failing to {{disclose}} the <b>incriminating</b> <b>statement</b> by Earl Mann during his 1999 arrest. Barberton police sought to have the case dismissed, but were blocked. The judge ruled that had Mann's statement to Officer Gerard Antenucci been disclosed to the defense, they most likely would have noticed the proximity of Mann, a convicted felon, to the Johnson residence as well as the bizarre behavior of Tonia Brasiel on the morning following the murder. The DNA of Mann would have almost certainly been run and Elkins would almost certainly not have been convicted. He later settled with the Barberton police for $5 million.|$|E
50|$|The Miranda warning {{is part of}} a {{preventive}} criminal procedure rule that law enforcement are required to administer to protect an individual who is in custody and subject to direct questioning or its functional equivalent from a violation of his or her Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination. In Miranda v. Arizona (1966), the Supreme Court held that the admission of an elicited <b>incriminating</b> <b>statement</b> by a suspect not informed of these rights violates the Fifth Amendment and the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, through the incorporation of these rights into state law. Thus, if law enforcement officials decline to offer a Miranda warning to an individual in their custody, they may interrogate that person and act upon the knowledge gained, but may not use that persons statements as evidence against him or her in a criminal trial.|$|E
50|$|Most damningly, a {{man named}} Gary Anderson confessed to police {{that he had been}} {{approached}} by Thatcher for help in the murder. He resembled the man neighbours described as sitting in the orange Ford Mustang while it was parked outside the Wilson residence. He also named two other men — Cody Crutcher and Charlie Wilde — as participants with him in the plot. The three men told police that: a) it was Anderson whom neighbours had seen sitting in the Ford Mustang outside the Wilson residence, b) there was a disguise in the Mustang back seat, and c) it was Colin Thatcher wearing the disguise who actually committed the murder. Police convinced Anderson to wear a wire and meet with Thatcher to try to elicit a confession or reveal details of the murder. During the recorded conversation, Thatcher made several statements that implied he was involved in the crime. Though Anderson made several attempts to elicit an <b>incriminating</b> <b>statement,</b> Thatcher did not confess directly. However, he did tell Anderson repeatedly to deny any direct accusations or indirect allegations. His responses and evasiveness, in addition to other evidence, convinced police that he was the mastermind.|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the behavior of the}} Guantánamo detainees in terms of colla-boration and disobedience and how it influences their chances of getting a release recommendation. Joint Task Force Guantanamo–authored memoranda on 765 detainees are used to create a network of accusations between detainees and an attribute data set, which are analyzed using multivariate regression and Kolmogorov– Smirnov tests. It is found that while the distribution of <b>incriminating</b> <b>statements</b> obeys a power law, 62. 6 percent of all detainees do not incriminate anyone. Yemenis and Saudi Arabians heavily overcontribute regarding <b>incriminating</b> <b>statements</b> and dis-obedient actions, whereas Afghans and Pakistanis undercontribute. Disobedient behavior does not affect the likelihood of getting a release recommendation, except for hunger striking, which has a negative effect. By releasing information, detainees don’t improve their own chances of getting release recommendations but impair those of the detainees they implicate. Three different groups of detainees are iden-tified whose behavioral patterns seem to follow distinct logics...|$|R
