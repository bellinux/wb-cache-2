5|$|Megachilid bees of {{the genus}} Anthidium use the hair (amongst that of various woolly plants) in making their nests. The seeds are {{generally}} too small for birds to feed on, although the American goldfinch <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> consume them. Other bird species {{have been reported to}} consume the leaves (Hawaiian goose) or flowers (palila), or to use the plant as a source when foraging for insects (white-headed woodpecker).|$|E
5|$|This species <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> grow solitary or {{in groups}} on sandy soil or rich {{composted}} soil in both mixed and coniferous forests, often beneath cedars.

5|$|All {{vanadium}} compounds {{should be}} considered toxic. Tetravalent VOSO4 <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> be at least 5 times more toxic than trivalent V2O3. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set an exposure limit of 0.05 mg/m3 for vanadium pentoxide dust and 0.1 mg/m3 for vanadium pentoxide fumes in workplace air for an 8-hour workday, 40-hour work week. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has recommended that 35 mg/m3 of vanadium be considered immediately dangerous to life and health, that is, likely to cause permanent health problems or death.|$|E
5|$|Gram {{quantities}} of various copper salts {{have been taken}} in suicide attempts and produced acute copper toxicity in humans, possibly due to redox cycling and the generation of reactive oxygen species that damage DNA. Corresponding amounts of copper salts (30mg/kg) are toxic in animals. A minimum dietary value for healthy growth in rabbits <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> be at least 3 ppm in the diet. However, higher concentrations of copper (100 ppm, 200 ppm, or 500 ppm) in the diet of rabbits may favorably influence feed conversion efficiency, growth rates, and carcass dressing percentages.|$|E

5|$|Improvements in {{structural}} alignment methods {{constitute an}} active area of research, and new or modified methods are often proposed that are claimed to offer advantages over the {{older and more}} widely distributed techniques. A recent example, TM-align, uses a novel method for weighting its distance matrix, to which standard dynamic programming is then applied. The weighting is proposed to accelerate the convergence of dynamic programming and correct for effects arising from alignment lengths. In a benchmarking study, TM-align <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> improve in both speed and accuracy over DALI and CE.|$|E
5|$|Psoriasis in {{the mouth}} is very rare, in {{contrast}} to lichen planus, another common papulosquamous disorder that commonly involves both the skin and mouth. When psoriasis involves the oral mucosa (the lining of the mouth), it may be asymptomatic, but it may appear as white or grey-yellow plaques. Fissured tongue {{is the most common}} finding in those with oral psoriasis and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> occur in 6.5–20% of people with psoriasis affecting the skin. The microscopic appearance of oral mucosa affected by geographic tongue (migratory stomatitis) is very similar to the appearance of psoriasis. However, modern studies have failed to demonstrate any link between the two conditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{intrinsic}} green luminescence of the cookiecutter shark is {{the strongest}} known of any shark, and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> persist for three hours {{after it has been}} taken out of water. The ventrally positioned photophores serve to disrupt its silhouette from below by matching the downwelling light, a strategy known as counter-illumination, that is common among bioluminescent organisms of the mesopelagic zone. The individual photophores are set around the denticles and are small enough that they cannot be discerned by the naked eye, suggesting they have evolved to fool animals with high visual acuity and/or at close distances.|$|E

5|$|All {{meitnerium}} isotopes {{are extremely}} unstable and radioactive; in general, heavier isotopes are {{more stable than}} the lighter. The most stable known meitnerium isotope, 278Mt, is also the heaviest known; it has a half-life of 7.6seconds. (The unconfirmed 282Mt is yet heavier and appears to have an even longer half-life of 67seconds.) A metastable nuclear isomer, 270mMt, <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> also have a half-life of over a second. The isotopes 276Mt and 274Mt have half-lives of 0.72 and 0.44seconds respectively. The remaining four isotopes have half-lives between 1 and 20milliseconds. The undiscovered isotope 281Mt has been predicted {{to be the most}} stable towards beta decay; no known meitnerium isotope has been observed to undergo beta decay. Some unknown isotopes, such as 265Mt, 272Mt, 273Mt, and 279Mt, are predicted to have half-lives longer than the known isotopes. Before its discovery, 274Mt and 277Mt were predicted to have half-lives of 20seconds and 1minute respectively, but they were later found to have half-lives of only 0.44seconds and 5milliseconds respectively.|$|E
5|$|During the day, {{the solitary}} tasselled {{wobbegong}} can generally be found lying inside caves or under ledges with its tail curled. Individual sharks tend to remain within a local area and have favored resting spots. While resting, it opportunistically ambushes nearby fishes and invertebrates, and also lures in prey by waving its tail {{to mimic the}} appearance of a small fish. At night, it emerges and actively forages for food. This species is aplacental viviparous, though little is known of its life history. The tasselled wobbegong <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> bite and kill humans unprovoked; attacks may result from people accidentally disturbing the shark or being misperceived as prey. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Near Threatened, as outside of Australia it is threatened by fisheries and habitat degradation.|$|E
