40|$|Abstract:- The Recognized Maritime Picture (RMP) {{is defined}} as a {{composite}} picture of activity over a maritime area of interest. In simplistic terms, building an RMP comes down to finding if something is there or not, and determining what it is, what it is doing, and whether some type of <b>follow-up</b> <b>action</b> is <b>required.</b> The generation and maintenance of an RMP consists in part of associating contact reports from sensor sources with existing tracks or initiating new tracks. This paper presents the use of fuzzy sets in the data fusion process. The proposed approach is based on the incomplete nature of the data and uses two stages of fusion, a contact level fusion and a track level fusion. The algorithm’s implementation is also presented as well as fusion specific examples with real data acquired off the East Coast of Canada. Key-Words:- Data fusion, fuzzy set, expert system, maritime picture...|$|R

40|$|Remote {{meetings}} {{are best for}} updates and information sharing, {{but it is possible}} to effectively facilitate decisions with a little planning. Generally, the meeting leader needs to clearly state the proposed decision and then separately poll each participant for concurrence. Normally, there will be a range of responses, requiring the facilitator to restate the proposal and repeat the process. Several iterations may be required before a consensus is achieved. I usually confirm decisions by restating the conclusion as it will appear in the meeting notes and asking the participants to express any objections. Gaining commitment to <b>follow-up</b> <b>actions</b> is never easy, of course, but tends to be particularly tricky in remote meetings. The ideal solution is to use collaboration software with a whiteboard as a means of recording the <b>follow-up</b> <b>actions</b> and responsibilities. (A Word or Excel document viewed through NetMeeting works equally well.) But if the meeting is being conducted without collaboration software, the leader must review each <b>follow-up</b> <b>action</b> explicitly, even painstakingly. I generally note <b>follow-up</b> <b>actions</b> throughout the meeting and use the last few minutes to confirm and finalize. I read each action and name the person I think owns the responsibility. When the person accepts, I validate by asking for a completion date. All the normal rules for assigning <b>follow-up</b> <b>actions</b> apply, of course. One, and only one, person must be responsible for each action, and assigning an action to somebody not present is akin to assigning it to nobody...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{influence}} of audit planning, fieldwork audit, audit reporting, <b>follow-up</b> <b>action</b> of the audit results, the auditor team competence, and independence of the auditor team on the internal audit quality at the General inspectorate of the Ministry of Finance, Indonesia. The study uses a research instrument in the form of a questionnaire which is submitted to the auditor team of the Inspector General and the head of office as the auditee in the Ministry of Finance. We also conducted interviews with senior auditors at the General Inspectorate and officials as the auditee at the Ministry of Finance. The sample is analysed by multiple regression analysis. The results show that the internal audit quality according to the auditor team perception is affected by audit planning, audit reporting, and auditor team competence. Fieldwork audit, <b>follow-up</b> <b>action</b> of the audit results, and the independence of the auditor team do not affect the internal audit quality. From the auditee’s perception, the internal audit quality is affected by audit planning, fieldwork audit, and the competence of the auditor team.

40|$|Imagine this: {{extension}} {{workers and}} technicians who {{go around the}} country in mobile offices equipped {{with a wide range of}} top-notch ICTs such as a global positioning system (GPS) device, digital cameras and laptops. With this equipment they have immediate access to vital agricultural information and can make recommendations to farmers on the spot. As a result, the technicians are able to spend 95 % of their time in the field instead of the office, providing direct technical assistance to farmers. This is not a distant future scenario, but is already happening in Honduras, where staff of the US-based agribusiness development consultancy Fintrac are working to increase sales of non-traditional horticultural produce and boost the incomes of smallholder farmers. It all started in 2000, when the USAID-funded Center for Developing Agribusiness (CDA) took on the task of revitalizing the Honduran non-traditional agricultural sector after the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch. Fintrac, which has a long track record in providing technical assistance in the Caribbean and Africa, was called upon to support farmers, food processors, exporters, and allied agribusinesses all along the farm-to-market chain. Its task is to manage knowledge, monitor and evaluate client farmers, disseminate technical information, and make market research data and information available to field technicians and clients. The programme collaborates with 500 ´lead partners´, and provides direct services to a further 5000 small farmers, focusing on improving production and post-harvest systems, market linkages, and infrastructure. To ensure the smooth operation of all the different information channels, the innovative use of ICTs has been decisive. While implementing the CDA programme in Honduras, Fintrac designed its own field-based management information system to provide real-time feedback from field staff on individual clients. The system is used to track technical assistance delivered, <b>follow-up</b> <b>actions</b> <b>required,</b> impacts and results, training, and investments. From their mobile offices, CDA´s field agronomists and other technicians enter this information into a database using a laptop, and submit it via the Internet for posting on Fintrac´s intranet. In addition to a laptop, CDA technicians also typically have at their disposal a GPS device, which is used to map farm boundaries, topography, and irrigation systems, as well as digital cameras, portable printers, cell phones, portable weather stations, and floppy disk drives. ´Technology is an important part of our work,´ says Andrew Medlicott, Fintrac´s Latin American Director. ´The information technology we use captures almost all of the activities and results in the field, based on which we can generate reports and data. The growers see the difference with the immediate delivery of analyses and recommendations. In most technical assistance programmes field staff record information and deliver it a week later after returning to their office. But a week is a long time in agriculture - it can mean the difference between profit and loss´. Fintrac has taken these ICT innovations and improved on them. In September 2003 the company launched new proprietary software, called the Client Impact and Results Information System (CIRIS), which has been designed specifically for agribusiness development programmes. The system´s reporting capabilities will enable an improved level of technical communication between Fintrac staff throughout Honduras and elsewhere. At the client level, not only will field technicians be able to access individual client data and follow-up technical assistance requirements, as is currently the case, they will also be able to view recommendations made by other field staff on a crop-specific basis across the world. With CIRIS, all Fintrac laptops will have fully replicated versions of the master database, so that field staff do not need to be online. This is critical if they are based in remote areas with only sporadic access to the Internet. On the programme management side, Fintrac project and home office supervisors, as well as donor staff, can access real-time reports online through the programme´s intranet. Along with extensive use of ICTs, Fintrac stresses the application of the latest and most affordable agricultural field technology. CDA technicians utilize basic agronomic equipment to assist growers in improving their production systems and in problem solving. It is the combination of effective ICTs along with the latest field equipment and production methods that have contributed to the success of the programme for the benefit of Honduran smallholder farmers. mailto:charlie@fintrac. com Charles Mahoney is a market analyst with the Fintrac CDA programme in Honduras.
