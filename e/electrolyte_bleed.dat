25|$|High {{blood levels}} of {{cortisol}} during critical illness could theoretically be protective because of several reasons. They modulate metabolism (for example, by inducing high blood sugar levels, thereby providing energy to the body). They also suppress excessive immune system activation and exert supporting effects on the circulatory system. Increased susceptibility to infections, hyperglycemia (in patients already prone to stress hyperglycemia), gastrointestinal <b>bleeding,</b> <b>electrolyte</b> disturbances and steroid-induced myopathy (in patients already prone to critical illness polyneuropathy) are possible harmful effects.|$|R

40|$|Hepatic {{encephalopathy}} (HE) is a neuropsychiatric syndrome complicating {{acute and}} chronic liver failure and {{characterized by a}} wide range of manifestations, in absence of other brain disease. HE is very frequent in course of cirrhosis and even mild forms involve a great additional burden on patients, their families and health -care resources. Its onset affects subsequent survival of patients. Historically, pathophysiology of HE was connected to several substances (mostly ammonia) produced in the gut and normally metabolized by the liver, but more recently other factors such as inflammation, bacterial translocation and oxidative stress have shown a crucial role. Symptoms are often overt (confusion, asterixis, disorientation, ataxia or coma) but can also be subtle (sleep disturbances, cognitive impairment, mood alterations, impairment of executive decision-making, and psychomotor speed – Minimal HE); the West Haven Criteria are most often used to grade Overt HE (OHE), with grade ranging from 0 to 4 (4 corresponding to coma). Since both Minimal HE and grade 1 HE cannot be diagnosed by clinical examination and need for specific tests, it results practical to combine these entities and name them "Covert" HE (CHE) to aid clinical use. Diagnosis is based on evidence of neurological impairment in presence of liver cirrhosis, only after the exclusion of other brain diseases. Measurement of serum ammonia and electroencephalography are little specific, while brain magnetic resonance and search for portosystemic shunts are important in complex cases. Diagnosis of OHE is often just clinical, while that of CHE requires dedicated psychometric and neurophysiological tests. Although these tests are difficult to be performed in the clinical practice, detection and treatment of CHE are cost-effective and important; indeed, CHE affects patients’ quality of life, socioeconomic status and driving skills, and increases the risk for falls, car accidents, development of OHE, and death. Management of HE includes early diagnosis and prompt treatment of precipitating factors (infection, gastrointestinal <b>bleeding,</b> <b>electrolyte</b> disturbances, dehydration, hypotension, use of benzodiazepines, psychoactive drugs, and/or alcohol). Current treatment is based principally on reducing intestinal ammonia with nonabsorbable disaccharides (lactulose or lactitol); rifaximin, used solely or in addition, is also becoming a first-line treatment. </span...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} H pylori infection, blood ammonia concentration and hepatic encephalopathy (HE), {{and the effect of}} H pylori eradication in cirrhotic patients. METHODS: From July 2003 to January 2005, 457 cirrhotic patients in five regions of Zhejiang Province were enrolled. Patients were evaluated for demographics, number connection test, H pylori infection, liver impairment, blood ammonia concentration and HE. Patients with H pylori infection were given 1 wk therapy with omeprazole plus clarithromycin and tinidazole. 14 C urea breath test was performed and mental symptoms and blood ammonia level were reassessed after bacterium eradication. RESULTS: Overall H pylori infection rate was 60. 6 %, and HE occurred in 47. 5 % of cirrhotic patients. Subclinical HE (SHE) was detected in 55 of 117 cirrhotic patients. Blood ammonia concentration in H pylori negative (n = 180) and positive (n = 277) cirrhotic patients was 53. 8 ± 51. 4 and 78. 4 ± 63. 6 μmol/L, respectively (P < 0. 01), which was significantly reduced to 53. 5 ± 37. 7 μmol/L after bacterium eradication (n = 126) (P < 0. 01). Blood ammonia was 97. 5 ± 81. 0 μmol/L in H pylori-positive cirrhotic patients, and this did not significantly change in those with persistent infection after H pylori eradication (n = 11). HE was more frequently observed in patients with H pylori infection than in those without (58. 5 % vs 30. 6 %, P < 0. 01). HE rate significantly dropped to 34. 1 % after H pylori eradiation (P < 0. 01). H pylori prevalence significantly differed among cirrhotic patients with HE (74. 4 %), SHE (69. 1 %), and those without HE (53. 2 %) (P < 0. 05). Blood ammonia level was significantly different among cirrhotic patients with HE (94. 5 ± 75. 6 μmol/L), SHE (59. 9 ± 49. 2 μmol/L), and without HE (47. 3 ± 33. 5 μmol/L) (P < 0. 05). Logistic regression analysis showed that blood ammonia concentration, Child-Pugh stage, upper gastrointestinal <b>bleeding,</b> <b>electrolyte</b> disturbance, and urea nitrogen were risk factors for HE. CONCLUSION: H pylori infection is an important factor for inducing high blood ammonia concentration and HE in cirrhotic patients.
