40|$|Irritable bowel {{syndrome}} (IBS) is a chronic, recurring, and remitting functional {{disorder of}} the gastrointestinal tract characterized by abdominal pain, distention, {{and changes in}} bowel habits. Although there are several drugs for IBS, effective and approved treatments for {{one or more of}} the symptoms for various IBS subtypes are needed. Improved understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms such as the role of impaired bile acid metabolism, neurohormonal regulation, immune, dysfunction, the epithelial barrier and the secretory properties of the gut has led to advancements in the treatment of IBS. With regards to therapies for restoring intestinal permeability, multiple studies with prebiotics and probiotics are ongoing, even if to date their efficacy has been limited. In parallel, much progress has been made in targeting low-grade inflammation, especially through the introduction of drugs such as mesalazine and rifaximin, even if a better knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the low-grade inflammation in IBS may allow the design of clinical trials that test the efficacy and safety of such drugs. This literature review aims to summarize the findings related to new and <b>investigational</b> <b>therapeutic</b> <b>agents</b> for IBS, most recently developed in preclinical as well as Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies...|$|R

50|$|Tecemotide (INN; emepepimut-S (USAN); {{formerly}} known as BLP25 or EMD 531444) is a synthetic lipopeptide that is used as antigen in an <b>investigational</b> <b>therapeutic</b> cancer vaccine ({{formerly known}} as Stimuvax, L-BLP25, BLP25 liposomal vaccine or BLP25 liposome vaccine). The <b>investigational</b> <b>therapeutic</b> cancer vaccine is designed to induce a cellular immune response to cancer cells that express MUC1, a glycoprotein antigen that is widely over-expressed on common cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer and colorectal cancer. The cellular immune response may lead then to a rejection of tumor tissue expressing the MUC1 antigen.|$|R

40|$|Several {{types of}} animal models of human thyroid carcinomas have been established, {{including}} subcutaneous xenograft and orthotopic implantation of cancer cells into immunodeficient mice. Subcutaneous xenograft {{models have been}} valuable for preclinical screening and evaluation of new therapeutic treatments. There {{are a number of}} advantages to using a subcutaneous model; 1) rapid, 2) reproducible, and 3) tumor establishment, growth, and response to <b>therapeutic</b> <b>agents</b> may be monitored by visual inspection. However, substantial evidence has shed light on the short-comings of subcutaneous xenograft models 1 - 3. For instance, medicinal treatments demonstrating curative properties in subcutaneous xenograft models often have no notable impact on the human disease. The microenvironment of the site of xenographic transplantation or injection {{lies at the heart of}} this dissimilarity. Orthotopic tumor xenograft models provide a more biologically relevant context in which to study the disease. The advantages of implanting diseased cells or tissue into their anatomical origin equivalent within a host animal includes a suitable site for tumor-host interactions, development of disease-related metastases and the ability to examine site-specific influence on <b>investigational</b> <b>therapeutic</b> remedies. Therefore, orthotopic xenograft models harbor far more clinical value because they closely reproduce human disease. For these reasons, a number o...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe local delilvery of <b>therapeutic</b> <b>agents</b> to the {{arterial}} wall represents {{a new strategy}} {{for the treatment of}} vascular diseases, including restenosis.
