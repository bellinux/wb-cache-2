25|$|When Marge {{escapes from}} the {{courtroom}} {{and goes to the}} library to see who Becky really is, she realizes that she is insane and being unfair to Becky, after finding nothing bad about her and a newspaper tablet of how Marge ruined Becky's marriage. Finally, she returns home, only to find Homer tied up, Lisa's arms and legs stuck to the wall, Maggie stuck in a cage, and Becky holding a knife in her hands. When Becky is about to 'kill' Homer, Marge snatches the knife from her and attempts to strangle her. It turns out that Bart is filming a scene in his movie for the school (now a music video). Homer also reveals that while he was fixing Marge's car, he accidentally drained the brake fluid. Marge apologizes to Becky, but Becky admits she was going to kill Marge and steal her family, but decided not to after she couldn't get a shovel. Suddenly the mental hospital doctors show up and shoot three tranquilizer darts into Marge's neck, which don't take effect. Marge tells them that she has too much to do to take a nap. She instructs Lisa to take Maggie out of the cage and tells Homer that she has some 'S for him' - scrubbing and mopping, since he is dressed for the job anyway. As Marge giggles, Homer fires a dart borrowed from the doctors into her, which sends <b>her</b> <b>straight</b> to sleep.|$|E

Benigno was one of these, though he said it was [...] "thoroughly enjoyable", gave the song a [...] "B+", and approved of the change in lyrics from [...] "Mr. Grinch" [...] to [...] "Sue the Grinch". Harper also approved of the change, and admitted she thought Lynch had sung it until Google set <b>her</b> <b>straight.</b> Futterman called the song a [...] "weirdly fitting moment" [...] that [...] "nevertheless fell a bit short of being fully realized". The second song, [...] "Welcome Christmas", was welcomed by reviewers: Benigno described it as [...] "really, really lovely" [...] and gave it an [...] "A". Harper cheered, and noted that the song [...] "was sung very much like a real glee club, without people getting to showboat individually". Futterman characterized it as a [...] "note-perfect performance", and wrote: [...] "The layered harmonies and simple sentiment—'Christmas will always be, just so long as we have glee!'—tie the episode up with a bow, smoothing out the bumps that came before it." ...|$|E
500|$|A six-inch manilla rope {{was passed}} from the tanker's stern to the destroyer's midship oiling bollard, the idea being to take the stern to port, whilst the {{minesweeper}} [...] towed her; but Ledbury put on too much weight and the minesweeper's tow parted. Penn then asked Ledbury to take the tanker in tow from ahead, which was done, using the tanker's tow and a shackle of Ledburys towing hawser-cable. Rye took the destroyer in tow to keep the ship from falling off, whilst Penn went alongside the starboard side of the tanker {{to act as a}} drag to keep <b>her</b> <b>straight.</b> Ledburys gunner, {{who was in charge of}} the towing party on board the tanker tried out all the tanker's guns, which proved valuable as at 10:44 the flotilla was attacked by nine Stukas. Just before the attack, American survivors from the merchantman Santa Elisa asked Commander Hill to take a party aboard Ohio to repair and man one of the anti-aircraft guns, an offer gratefully accepted by Ledburys captain. In the attack, Ledbury received a near miss within a few feet of the fo'c'sle, which fortunately was an oil bomb and caused no casualties. There was also a near miss astern. Help was however on the way, since Malta based Spitfires covered the ships and broke many enemy formations. This was the last successful attack, and Ledbury, Penn and Bramham secured either side of the tanker, and by some very skilful seamanship and endurance on the part of the crews brought Ohio into Valletta Harbour.|$|E
500|$|Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News {{considered}} the album's title {{to be influenced}} by Janet Jackson's Damita Jo, which was also based on an alternate persona. According to Jenson Macey from BBC News, The Emancipation of Mimi was Carey's strongest effort from the 2000s; he said that the album [...] "took <b>her</b> <b>straight</b> back {{to the top of the}} A-List." [...] Caroline Sullivan from The Guardian gave the album four stars out of five, calling it [...] "cool, focused and urban." [...] The New York Timess, Jon Pareles, complimented how Carey wrote all of the album's material. He felt the record's sound was fresh and innovative: [...] "on The Emancipation of Mimi, she disciplines herself into coherence, using fewer tricks and sounding more believable. She also finds what lesser singers can take for granted: a certain lightness that eases her constant sense of control." [...] Cummings from PopMatters gave the album seven stars out of ten, claiming it to be Carey's redemption from the manacles of her previous two releases. He praised the album's singles, but called some of its music [...] "corny" [...] and [...] "unnecessarily overproduced". Todd Burns from Stylus Magazine gave the album a B−, admiring its assortment of beats and tempos. Burns, however, called some of The Neptunes and Dupri's production [...] "ill-advised". He called some of Carey's vocals [...] "strained, thin and airy". While considering it as an improvement over her previous releases of the decade, he concluded that it [...] "suffers from the fact that her vocals have deteriorated – a simple fact of the ravages that her voice has undergone in the past fifteen years." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine gave The Emancipation of Mimi three and a half stars out of five, calling it [...] "redemption". He complimented its array of beats and its production. Critic Andre Meyer of CBS News thought the material on the album was [...] "stronger" [...] than on Charmbracelet, and described it as a move in Carey's long-term plan for pop domination, while giving off the [...] "jittery R vibe that made Destiny's Child so potent." [...] He added that [...] "Mariah has returned to singing – while still pushing the limits of good taste with her barely there outfits." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{sculpture}} is {{carved from}} a single block of white Carrara marble – a rare medium for Giambologna. The surface is highly finished and in good condition aside from some drill and rasp marks.

She has a blank, inscrutable expression, and wavy, centrally-parted hair. <b>Her</b> <b>straight</b> nose reflects classical Roman sculpture. There is a bracelet on her left arm, and a chemise or shift with embroidered cuffs is draped across her left thigh. The woman's pose is complex, with her weight resting mostly on her left buttock, which is seated on a round column from which drapery hangs. According to art historian Peggy Fogelman, [...] "With one leg and both arms positioned in front of her, the figure's weight and the compositional balance seem tilted forward". Her left leg is raised; her knee sharply bent. The head is inclined downwards, and her eyes are blank. She holds an ointment jar in her left hand, raised high above her head. Her right hand holds a small cloth which she uses to clean her left foot.|$|E
