5|$|Black {{doubts that}} Winston is the killer, and while Hollis {{stays in the}} hotel, he visits the production's climactic shoot, set during a {{performance}} by the band Kiss. As <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> him, the sheriff's body is thrown down from the rafters; as the pandemonium settles, Black realizes that horror films end with the leading lady being targeted—the killer is after Hollis. Racing back to her hotel, Black discover Hollis fending off a chainsaw-wielding Bianco. Black is able to subdue Bianco after Hollis disables the chainsaw; the actor then explains that he lacked Black's insight and had to commit the crimes {{in order to see}} {{through the eyes of a}} killer.|$|E
500|$|The Doctor, Rose, and Adam {{arrive on}} Floor 139 of Satellite 5, {{a space station}} {{orbiting}} Earth in the year 200,000. [...] The Doctor uses his sonic screwdriver to get Adam and Rose some credits to buy food while <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> the station. The Doctor meets a woman named Cathica, a reporter who tells him that the station is a giant broadcast tower transmitting news across Earth. They are led to a room where she sits down in a chair located {{in the center of}} a round table. The reporters are connected to the computer via a special port installed directly into the brain. The Doctor believes there is a malevolent purpose to the station that is holding back human development. [...] He learns from Cathica that a select few are invited to Floor 500, which is believed to be the highest promotion that can be earned on the station.|$|E
2500|$|Two more {{numbers from}} Harrison close the show. When he {{apparently}} forgets {{part of the}} second verse in [...] "Something", <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>around,</b> seemingly at Russell or Clapton, and grins his way through it. The film concludes with a spirited version of Harrison's then-current single, [...] "Bangla Desh", intercut at first with footage of the suffering refugees the concert was aiming to provide aid for. Towards {{the end of the}} song, Harrison exits the stage {{while the rest of the}} band plays on.|$|E
60|$|The man ceased his task. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around,</b> {{a little}} bewildered.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> {{from one}} cadet to another. But nobody spoke.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> before replying. The {{old habits}} had not deserted him.|$|R
60|$|A father confessor,--his {{reflections}} on character, and {{the contrast of}} the inward man with the outward, as <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> on his congregation, all whose secret sins are known to him.|$|E
6000|$|Yet oft with anxious heart <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>around,</b> [...] And {{marks the}} first green blade that breaks the ground; [...] In fancy sees his {{trembling}} oats uprun, [...] His tufted barley yellow with the sun.|$|E
6000|$|... "And you know, Esther," [...] {{said the}} younger, [...] "I think {{he begins to}} take more notice of things, {{especially}} when he is out-of-doors. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> on the scenery, and his eye brightens, {{as if he knew}} all about it; and sometimes he knits his brows, and looks down so, as if he was trying to remember." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> at her directly, for he {{knew where}} the {{grievance}} lay.|$|R
60|$|He cut {{the cords}} which still secured Graham's limbs. Then <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> him.|$|R
60|$|He {{laid down}} the receiver. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> him like {{a man in a}} nightmare.|$|R
6000|$|SECRETARY--[Turning {{around on}} his stool.] What the devil is that--someone knocking? [Shouts:] Come in, why don't you? [All {{the men in the}} room look up. YANK opens the door slowly, gingerly, as if afraid of an ambush. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> for secret doors, mystery, is taken aback by the commonplaceness of the room and the men in it, thinks he may have gotten in the wrong place, then sees the {{signboard}} on the wall and is reassured.] ...|$|E
60|$|By {{the time}} the teacher has {{proceeded}} thus far, he finds, as <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> the room, that the countenances of his pupils are assuming a listless and inattentive air. One is restless in his seat, evidently paying no attention. Another has reclined his head upon his desk, lost in a reverie, and others are looking round the room, at one another, or at the door, restless and impatient, hoping the dull lecture will soon be over.|$|E
6000|$|MR. WILLINGS, marvelling {{more and}} more as he unfolds his tale, 'Ladies, it is quite a romance, I was in the----' <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> cautiously, but he knows that they are all to be trusted--'in the Church Army {{quarters}} in Central Street, trying to get on the track of one or two of our missing men. Suddenly my eyes--I can't account for it--but suddenly my eyes alighted on a Highlander seated rather drearily on a bench, with his kit at his feet.' ...|$|E
60|$|He strolled {{along the}} bank with Evelyn, {{following}} the hunt up-stream. Suddenly <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around.</b>|$|R
60|$|Graham {{turned his}} head for a moment, and his eyes glittered when <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> the tent, and, espying a whip lying near a trunk, {{picked it}} up.|$|R
6000|$|Man, if {{he would}} live, must worship. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>around,</b> and what to him, within the vision of his life, is the {{greatest}} and the best, that he falls down and does reverence to. To him whose eyes have opened on the nineteenth century, what nobler image can the universe produce than the figure of Falsehood in stolen robes? It is cunning and brazen and hollow-hearted, and it realizes his souls ideal, and he falls and kisses its feet, and clings to its skinny knees, swearing fealty to it for evermore! ...|$|E
6000|$|Now, it is {{different}} with {{the young man who}} is not shy. He has temptations which his bashful brother never encounters. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> and everywhere sees roguish eyes and laughing lips. What more natural than that amid so many roguish eyes and laughing lips he should become confused and, forgetting for the moment which particular pair of roguish ayes and laughing lips it is that he belongs to, go off making love to the wrong set. The shy man, who never looks at anything but his own boots, sees not and is not tempted. Happy shy man! ...|$|E
60|$|When {{the little}} party arrive, he is {{suspicious}} and irritable, and, of course, soon excommunicated. Then, {{as he stands}} in disconsolate anger, looking over the garden fence at the gay group making dandelion chains, and playing baby house under the trees, he wonders why he is not like other children. He wishes he were different, and yet {{he does not know}} what to do. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>around,</b> and every thing is blooming and bright. His little bed of flowers is even brighter and sweeter than ever before, and a new rose is just opening on his rosebush.|$|E
60|$|Borrowdean smiled. A certain rough-and-ready humour {{about this}} woman always appealed to him. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around.</b>|$|R
60|$|Pushing {{through the}} crowd, I tapped Stumpy on the shoulder. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> in assumed surprise.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> to be {{sure that}} Parkins was gone and, leaning from his place, kissed her.|$|R
6000|$|... "You may ask aught {{which it}} is {{becoming}} to me to answer. The bishop hath need of a champion, because, if any cause be set to test of combat, it would scarce become his office to go down into the lists with leather and shield and cudgel to exchange blows with any varlet. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> him then for some tried fighting man, some honest smiter who can give a blow or take one. It is {{not for me to}} say how far he hath succeeded, but it is sooth that he who thinks that he hath but to do with the Bishop of Montaubon, finds himself face to face with Francois Poursuivant d'Amour Pelligny." ...|$|E
60|$|It was no {{wonderful}} case. Men {{of large}} mind are very rarely happy men. It is your little animal-minded individual {{who can be}} happy. Thus women, who reflect less, are as a class much happier and more contented than men. But the large-minded man sees too far, and guesses too {{much of what he}} cannot see. He looks forward, and notes the dusty end of his laborious days; <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> and shudders at the unceasing misery of a coarse struggling world; the sight of the pitiful beggar babe craving bread on tottering feet, pierces his heart. He cannot console himself with a reflection that the child had no business to be born, or that if he denuded himself of his last pound he would not materially help the class which bred it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, la, la, la!--no," [...] said Diana. [...] "Notice that 'la, la, la,' Aunt Liberty? Got {{that from}} 'Paris by Night' {{on the roof}} garden under me. You'll hear that 'la, la, la' at the Café McCann now, along with 'garsong.' The bohemian crowd there have become tired of 'garsong' since O'Rafferty, the head waiter, punched three of them for calling him it. Oh, no; the town's strickly on the bum these nights. Everybody's away. Saw a {{downtown}} merchant on a roof garden this evening with his stenographer. Show was so dull he went to sleep. A waiter biting on a dime tip {{to see if it}} was good half woke him up. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> and sees his little pothooks perpetrator. 'H'm!' says he, 'will you take a letter, Miss De St. Montmorency?' 'Sure, in a minute,' says she, 'if you'll make it an X.' ...|$|E
60|$|As Hal spoke, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> for Dick Ferris. The tall {{youth was}} nowhere to be seen.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> and, {{as if for}} {{the first}} time, missed Louise. He came toward them at once.|$|R
60|$|And <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> with a {{smile as}} {{pleasant}} {{as if he had}} just invented a new sewing-machine.|$|R
60|$|Mr Jinkins thanks {{them from}} his heart. It is, by many degrees, the proudest {{day in his}} humble career. When <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> him on the present occasion, he feels that he wants words in which to express his gratitude. One thing he will say. He hopes {{it has been shown}} that Todgers's can be true to itself; and that, an {{opportunity}} arising, it can come out quite as strong as its neighbours--perhaps stronger. He reminds them, amidst thunders of encouragement, that they have heard of a somewhat similar establishment in Cannon Street; and that they have heard it praised. He wishes to draw no invidious comparisons; he would be the last man to do it; but when that Cannon Street establishment shall be able to produce such a combination of wit and beauty as has graced that board that day, and shall be able to serve up (all things considered) such a dinner as that of which they have just partaken, he will be happy to talk to it. Until then, gentlemen, he will stick to Todgers's.|$|E
6000|$|The curious traveller, who, {{from open}} day, [...] 560 [...] Hath passed with torches into some huge cave, [...] The Grotto of Antiparos, [p] or the Den [...] In old time haunted by that Danish Witch, [...] Yordas; [q] <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> {{and sees the}} vault [...] Widening on all sides; sees, or thinks he sees, [...] 565 [...] Erelong, the massy roof above his head, [...] That {{instantly}} unsettles and recedes,-- [...] Substance and shadow, light and darkness, all [...] Commingled, making up a canopy [...] Of shapes and forms and tendencies to shape [...] 570 [...] That shift and vanish, change and interchange [...] Like spectres,--ferment silent and sublime! [...] That after a short space works less and less, [...] Till, every effort, every motion gone, [...] The scene before him stands in perfect view [...] 575 [...] Exposed, and lifeless as a written book!-- [...] But let him pause awhile, and look again, [...] And a new quickening shall succeed, at first [...] Beginning timidly, then creeping fast, [...] Till the whole cave, so late a senseless mass, [...] 580 [...] Busies the eye with images and forms [...] Boldly assembled,--here is shadowed forth [...] From the projections, wrinkles, cavities, [...] A variegated landscape,--there the shape [...] Of some gigantic warrior clad in mail, [...] 585 [...] The ghostly semblance of a hooded monk. [...] Veiled nun, or pilgrim resting on his staff: [...] Strange congregation! yet not slow to meet [...] Eyes that perceive through minds that can inspire.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{continued}} Zenobia, [...] "the Ditch didn't boom ez soon ez they kalkilated. And {{then the}} boys kept gettin' poorer and poorer, and Ned he kept gettin' poorer and poorer in everything but his hopefulness and grit. Then <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> for more capital. And about this time, that coyote Harkins smelt suthin' nice up there, and he gits Ned {{to give him}} control of it, and he'll lend him his name and fix up a company. Soon ez he gets control, {{the first thing he}} does is to say that it wants half a million o' money to make it pay, and levies an assessment of two hundred dollars a share. That's nothin' for them rich fellows to pay, or pretend to pay, but for boys on grub wages it meant only ruin. They couldn't pay, and had to forfeit their shares for next to nothing. And Ned made one more desperate attempt to save them and himself by borrowing money on his shares; when that hound Harkins got wind of it, and let it be buzzed around that the Ditch is a failure, and that he was goin' out of it; that brought the shares down to nothing. As Ned couldn't raise a dollar, the new company swooped down on his shares for the debts THEY had put up, and left him and the boys to help themselves. Ned couldn't bear to face the boys that he'd helped to ruin, and put out, and ain't been heard from since. After Harkins had got rid of Ned and the boys he manages to pay off that wonderful debt, and sells out for a hundred thousand dollars. That money--Ned's money--he sends to Sacramento, for he don't dare to travel with it himself, and is kalkilatin' to leave the kentry, for some of the boys allow to kill him on sight. So ef you're wantin' to hunt suthin', thar's yer chance, and you needn't go inter the snow to do it." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{drew his}} chair closer to hers. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> him nervously, the horror {{was in his}} eyes.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> and nodded. The commissionaire was waiting. Peter {{took up his}} silk hat {{from under}} the seat.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around.</b> The words {{seemed to}} fail him. Their little {{corner of the}} winter garden was still uninvaded.|$|R
