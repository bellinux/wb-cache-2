40|$|In 2003, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China made an {{importance}} decision to revitalize old <b>industrial</b> <b>bases</b> in Northeast China. quite {{a large number}} of experts and academics have provided specific resolutions to how to revitalize old <b>industrial</b> <b>bases</b> in Northeast China. However, there are still some people who hold the idea of waiting, depending and asking, and they believe that only if the country provides loan, policy and project, can old <b>industrial</b> <b>bases</b> in Northeast China be revitalized. To revitalize old <b>industrial</b> <b>bases</b> in Northeast China is a long term process, so offer of loan, policy and project by the country can only resolve demand for momentary use. The top priority is still to integrate human capital and strengthen vigor of investment in human capital. In view of the above situation, this article points out significance of investment in human capital compared with investment in material capital and mentions that in the process of revitalizing old <b>industrial</b> <b>bases</b> in Northeast China, in addition to offer of loan and project by the country, we should change our mind and make use of our intelligence and wisdom to strengthen vigor of investment in human capital and to revitalize old <b>industrial</b> <b>bases</b> in Northeast China...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: As {{the most}} {{potential}} {{industry in the}} knowledge economy, the modern service industry plays an increasingly important role in economic development. In this paper, the SWOT analysis of modern service industry {{has been done in}} the old <b>industrial</b> <b>bases</b> where the technological renovation leads to industrial decline. The results show that geographical position’s superiority, abundant natural resources, complete industrial system, convenient transportation condition and government policy support etc. are the strengths and opportunities of modern service industry development in the old <b>industrial</b> <b>bases.</b> While lagging development level, imperfect service support system, deficient human resources, lack of technical innovation ability and serious social problems etc. will bring negative impact to the modern service industry of the old <b>industrial</b> <b>bases.</b> Key words: The old industrial bases; Modern service industry; SWOT analysis...|$|R
5|$|The {{war effort}} had brought about {{significant}} diversification in the area's <b>industrial</b> <b>base.</b> This diversity facilitated the area's {{transition to a}} peacetime economy though the petroleum industry again became a major focus. In 1952 the Gulf Freeway, then part of U.S. Route 75, was completed providing a fast automobile link between Houston and Galveston. The new freeway, considered an engineering marvel at the time, greatly encouraged new development in the western region of the bay.|$|E
5|$|After India's independence, the Maharaja, Jayachamarajendra Wodeyar, {{allowed his}} kingdom's {{accession}} to India. In 1950, Mysore became an Indian {{state of the}} same name; the former Maharaja served as its Rajpramukh (head of state) until 1975. Following the long-standing demand of the Ekikarana Movement, Kodagu- and Kannada-speaking regions from the adjoining states of Madras, Hyderabad and Bombay were incorporated into the Mysore state, under the States Reorganisation Act of 1956. The thus expanded state was renamed Karnataka, seventeen years later, in 1973. In the early 1900s through the post-independence era, industrial visionaries such as Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvarayya, born in Muddenahalli, Chikballapur district, {{played an important role}} in the development of Karnataka's strong manufacturing and <b>industrial</b> <b>base.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1895 another Parliamentary select {{committee}} recommended the compulsory {{adoption of the}} metric system after a two-year permissive period. The 1897 Weights and Measures Act legalised the metric units for trade, but did not make them mandatory. A bill to make the metric system compulsory in order to enable the British <b>industrial</b> <b>base</b> to fight off {{the challenge of the}} nascent German base passed through the House of Lords in 1904, but did not pass in the House of Commons before the next general election was called. Following opposition by the Lancashire cotton industry, a similar bill was defeated in 1907 in the House of Commons by 150 votes to 118.|$|E

5|$|Japan's {{rapid advance}} south had been unexpected, and the {{perceived}} threat of invasion led to a major expansion of the Australian military. By mid-1942 the Army had a strength of ten infantry divisions, three armoured divisions {{and hundreds of other}} units. Thousands of Australians who were ineligible for service in the military responded to the threat of attack by joining auxiliary organisations such as the Volunteer Defence Corps and Volunteer Air Observers Corps, which were modelled on the British Home Guard and Royal Observer Corps respectively. However, Australia's population and <b>industrial</b> <b>base</b> were not sufficient to maintain these forces once the threat of invasion had passed, and the Army was progressively reduced in size from 1943.|$|E
5|$|Just beyond East Norwood, the Pennsylvania built McCullough Yard in 1927, {{improving}} switching {{operations for}} the growing <b>industrial</b> <b>base</b> in Norwood. A connection was included to the Pennsylvania's Chicago-bound Richmond Branch, which the CL crossed over north of the yard. In Butler County, north of Brecon, the CL curved abruptly northeast onto the original line, partially graded in the 1850s between Sharonville and Lebanon. Just beyond, it began to descend slowly through Mason to Hageman, where it crossed the Middletown Branch, and then rose slightly, alongside Turtle Creek, to Lebanon. The Pennsylvania tore down the original Lebanon passenger station in 1960, replacing it (for freight purposes) with a smaller building from Kings Mills on the Little Miami Railroad. The Lebanon Council of Garden Clubs acquired the land in 1972, tore down the freight depot, and erected {{a replica of the}} old passenger depot in its place, with a gift shop inside.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Submarine Corporation {{construction}} {{facility was}} established on previously undeveloped {{land on the}} bank of the Port River, at Osborne, South Australia. Work on the site began on 29 June 1987, and it was opened in November 1989. South Australia was selected as the site of the construction facility based on the proposed location of the facility and promises by the State Government to help minimise any problems caused by workers unions. The state's bid was aided by careful promotion to both Kockums and IKL/HDW during early in the project, and problems with the other states' proposals: Tasmania and Western Australia lacked the necessary <b>industrial</b> <b>base,</b> New South Wales could not decide on the location of the construction facility, Victoria's proposed site was poorly sited, and building in Liberal-led Queensland would have been politically unwise for the project when Labor was in power both federally and in all other states.|$|E

5|$|The British colonial {{government}} did not support industrialisation in the region, and local capital remained invested mostly in land and money lending, {{which led to the}} later development of banking in the region. With the arrival of European missionaries in the early 19th century, the region saw the development of educational institutions and a modern <b>industrial</b> <b>base,</b> modelled on European industries. The opening of the Lutheran Swiss Basel Mission in 1834 was central to the industrialisation process. Printing press, cloth-weaving mills and factories manufacturing Mangalore tiles were set up by the missionaries. When Canara (part of the Madras Presidency until this time) was bifurcated into North Canara and South Canara in 1859, Mangalore was transferred into South Canara and became its headquarters. South Canara remained under Madras Presidency, while North Canara was detached from Madras Presidency and transferred to Bombay Presidency in 1862.|$|E
5|$|The city's <b>industrial</b> <b>base</b> {{continued}} {{to grow in the}} post-war era partly assisted by the area's first agency entirely devoted to industrial development, the RIDC. Jones and Laughlin Steel Company expanded its plant on the Southside. H.J. Heinz, Pittsburgh Plate Glass, Alcoa, Westinghouse, U.S. Steel and its new division, the Pittsburgh Chemical Company and many other companies also continued robust operations through the 1960s. 1970 marked the completion of the final building projects of Renaissance I: the U.S. Steel Tower and Three Rivers Stadium. In 1974, with the addition of the fountain {{at the tip of the}} Golden Triangle, Point State Park was completed. Although air quality was dramatically improved, and Pittsburgh's manufacturing base seemed solid, questions abound about the negative effects Urban Renewal continues to have on the social fabric of Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh, however, was about to undergo one of its most dramatic transformations.|$|E
5|$|The four {{objectives}} of the operation (which evolved over time) were to boost the sagging morale of the Saigon regime in the Republic of Vietnam, to persuade North Vietnam to cease its support for the communist insurgency in South Vietnam without actually taking any ground forces into communist North Vietnam, to destroy North Vietnam's transportation system, <b>industrial</b> <b>base,</b> and air defenses, and to halt the flow of men and material into South Vietnam. Attainment of these objectives was made difficult by both the restraints imposed upon the U.S. and its allies by Cold War exigencies and by the military aid and assistance received by North Vietnam from its communist allies, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China (PRC) and North Korea.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 19th century the City became a {{railroad}} hub as people traveled {{along the eastern}} corridor. In the 20th century, Salisbury's economy grew into an <b>industrial</b> <b>based</b> economy, in a {{large part because of}} textiles and the numerous mills operating in the city.|$|R
5|$|The {{pillars of}} the {{economic}} plan were trade and fiscal budget surpluses and a high exchange rate for the United States dollar. The surplus was increased by taxes levied during de la Rúa's presidency and the devaluation which occurred during the Duhalde administration. Kirchner sought to rebuild the Argentine <b>industrial</b> <b>base,</b> public works and public services, renegotiating the operation of public services privatized by Carlos Menem and owned by foreign companies. His policies were accompanied by a nationalist rhetoric sympathetic to the poor. However, despite of the financial prosperity, {{there was no significant}} {{decrease in the number of}} people living in poverty, which was 8 to 10 million people, or almost 25% of the country.|$|E
5|$|On 2 March 1965, the United States Government {{launched}} Operation Rolling Thunder, a major bombing campaign, {{with several}} objectives. Firstly, {{the operation was}} supposed to retaliate against North Vietnam for their military activities inside South Vietnam, thereby raising {{the morale of the}} South Vietnamese people, especially the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN). Secondly, it aimed to impede North Vietnam’s ability to wage war by reducing, if not stopping, the flow of men and material into South Vietnam. Thirdly, the overall objective was to persuade the North Vietnamese Government to find a compromise through negotiations. Originally the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff submitted a list of 94 targets to be hit over a period of 16 days, but U.S. President Lyndon Johnson decided to include military targets in order to gradually apply pressure on the North Vietnamese Government, so the list of targets grew to 427 {{by the end of the}} campaign. In the first phase of the operation, which lasted from spring to summer of 1965, American airpower mainly targeted the North Vietnamese capital of Hanoi and its limited <b>industrial</b> <b>base.</b>|$|E
5|$|Questions then arose {{among the}} U.S. {{administration}} and military leadership {{as to the}} best method by which Hanoi (the perceived locus of the insurgency) could be dissuaded from its course of action. The answer seemed to lie {{in the application of}} air power. By 1964 most of the civilians surrounding President Lyndon B. Johnson shared the Joint Chiefs of Staff's collective faith in the efficacy of strategic bombing to one degree or another. They reasoned that a small nation like North Vietnam, with a tiny <b>industrial</b> <b>base</b> that was just emerging after the First Indochina War, would be reluctant to risk its new-found economic viability to support the insurgency in the south. Constantly affecting this decision-making process were fears of possible counter moves or outright intervention by the Soviet Union, the PRC, or both. The civilians and the military were divided, however, on the manner of affecting Hanoi's will to support the southern insurgency. The civilians thought in terms of changing the regime's behavior while the military men were more concerned with breaking its will.|$|E
40|$|Key Words: {{reform of}} {{state-owned}} enterprises; the old industrial bases; innovation; revitalization Abstract. The key and prerequisite of realizing {{the revitalization of}} old <b>industrial</b> <b>bases</b> are to further deepen the reform of state-owned enterprises and try the best to promote the institutional innovation and the mechanism innovation. The revitalization of old <b>industrial</b> <b>bases</b> is carried out under the condition of reform and opening up {{as well as the}} development of socialist market economy. Therefore, it must follow the requirements of new industrialization and make a fuss in the “new”. Deepening the reform, expanding the opening up and promoting the institutional innovation, they are considered as the important symbols for realizing the revitalization of the Northeast Division. It is necessary to actively promote the strategic adjustment of the layout of state-owned economy and speed up the restructuring of key industries. Accelerating the development and achieving the revitalization require us to hold high the banner of reform and opening up and firmly set up the ideas of relying on reform and opening up and market mechanisms to realize the revitalization. Continuing to deepen the reform and expanding the opening up have provided a powerful driving force for revitalizing the old <b>industrial</b> <b>bases...</b>|$|R
