50|$|There {{has been}} a {{resurgence}} of attention on T. kok-saghyz due to allergic reactions to <b>Hevea</b> <b>rubber</b> used in medical devices, and to shortcomings of the Hevea brasiliensis rubber supply. One threat to Hevea brasiliensis rubber production is the South American Leaf Blight (SALB), which has afflicted conventional rubber production in South America since 1934. This blight may spread to the Hevea brasiliensis trees in Southeast Asia, which are genetically very similar {{to each other and}} those of South America. Furthermore, land used for rubber production is being converted to palm oil plantations in order to produce biofuel, and labor costs reduce the profitability of Hevea brasiliensis plantations, as each tree must be manually tapped in order to harvest its latex. Rising oil prices limit the economic viability of synthetic rubbers, and natural rubber often cannot be pragmatically replaced by a synthetic equivalent.|$|E
50|$|Mucuna bracteata is a leguminous plant. It is a nitrogen-regulating {{plant that}} is used in agroecosystems {{operating}} around certain types of agricultural plant systems including: rubber trees, oil palm, citrus and coconut.

The Mucuna bracteata crop grows about 10-15 cm/day in conditions similar to those that rubber and palm oil plants thrive in. Mucuna bracteata grows in a warm and humid ecosystem, at a temperature of about 20-35 degrees Celsius, and consistent annual rainfall.

40|$|In a {{suitable}} organic solvent, Hevea natural rubber (NR) disintegrates into an insoluble gel phase (macrogel) and a sol phase consisting of polyisoprene chains with micro-aggregates (microgel). Studies on Hevea microgel following {{the advent of}} its quantitation by steric exclusion chromatography (SEC) are quite recent. In this study, transesterification of NR favoured macrogel elimination with unclear effects on the microgel. The NR's structure and the relative gel quantities varied in solution (depending on the solvents used) and during transesterification to produce substantial quantities of low-to-average molar mass chains (probably from the macrogel and/or the microgel fraction). The macrogel broke down equally to microgel. This microgel, representing 25 %- 30 % <b>Hevea</b> <b>rubber,</b> remained insensitive to transesterification.

40|$|Natural rubber, {{obtained}} {{almost exclusively}} from the Para rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis), {{is a unique}} biopolymer of strategic importance that, in many of its most significant applications, cannot be replaced by synthetic rubber alternatives.

However, the heterozygous nature, long breeding time of trees and the prolonged period required for evaluation of mature traits are strong limitations for conventional breeding and selection methods. The development of methods for in vitro culture and genetic engineering has increased the possibility of producing rubber genotypes with improved latex yield, tolerance to tapping panel dryness (TPD) syndrome, growth rate and wood quality or reduction in undesirable traits. The combination of conventional breeding and molecular techniques will help to develop rubber trees with positive effects on the environment. However, the risks associated with the biotechnological applications should be carefully evaluated and field trials are to be performed with transgenic rubber tree. Genomic technologies were taken up by various research groups working on Hevea to identify new targets for breeding and/or complementary genetic transformation.

40|$|Natural rubber (cis- 1, 4 -polyisoprene) is an isoprenoid {{compound}} produced {{exclusively in}} plants by {{the action of}} rubber transferase. Despite a keen interest in revealing the mechanisms of rubber chain elonga-tion and chain length determination, the molecular nature of rubber transferase has not yet been identi-®ed. A recent report has revealed that a 24 kDa protein tightly associated with the small rubber particles of Hevea brasiliensis, therefore designated small rubber particle protein (SRPP), plays a positive role in rubber biosynthesis. Since guayule (Parthenium argentatum Gray) produces natural rubber similar in size to H. brasiliensis, it is of critical interest to investigate whether guayule contains a similar protein to the SRPP. A cDNA clone has been isolated in guayule that shares a sequence homology with the SRPP, thus designated guayule homologue of SRPP (GHS), and the catalytic function of the protein was characterized. Sequence analysis revealed that the GHS is highly homologous in several conserved regions to the SRPP (50 % identity). In vitro functional analysis of the recombi-nant protein overexpressed in E. coli revealed that the GHS plays a positive role in isopentenyl diphos-phate incorporation into high molecular weight rubbers as SRPP does. These results indicate that guayule and <b>Hevea</b> <b>rubber</b> trees contain a protein that is similar in its amino acid sequence and plays a role in isopentenyl diphosphate incorporation in vitro, implying that it contributes to the enhancement of rubber biosynthetic activity in rubber trees...|$|E
40|$|The {{treatment}} of <b>Hevea</b> brasiliensis (<b>rubber</b> tree) bark by chloro- 2 -ethyl phosphonic acid (ethrel), an ethylene-producing compound, induces {{a significant increase}} in the tonoplast H+-translocating ATPase activity in the latex during the first 24 hours after the application of the stimulating agent. Moreover, the tonoplast-bound ATPase is highly activated when vacuoles (lutoids) are resuspended in ultrafiltrated cytosol. This effect is amplified during ethrel stimulation. Preliminary assays to characterize the endogenous effector(s) suggest that the activator(s) could be a heat-resistant compound with a low molecular weight, most likely an anion.
