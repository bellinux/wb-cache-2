The method operates on the signal at {{the output of the}} transmitter, acquired through a <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> I/Q <b>receiver.</b> It is designed to correctly take into account the peculiarities of systems compliant to the standard IEEE 802. 16 - 2004, such as the potentially noxious effects of impairments on signal normalization.

40|$|<b>General</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>receivers</b> {{of today}} are {{designed}} with a broad bandwidth so that the receiver can accept {{a wide range of}} signal frequencies. These receivers usually accept one signal along with any interference that is included. To increase the signal detection capabilities of the wideband receiver, a design for a receiver that can detect two signals is needed. One of the requirements for this receiver is that the second weak signal needs to be processed in a timely manner so that the receiver can recognize it. To remedy the problem, a module was developed using wavelet-based techniques to remove spurs from the incoming signals to allow easier detection. The main basis for this concentration on wavelets comes from the way wavelets break down signals into portions (called resolutions) that allow easier determination of detail importance. Utilizing the multi-resolution attributes of the discrete wavelet transform, a way to remove signal spurs is made possible. When removing the signal noise from the signal, the two signal dynamic range of the system is increased, as this module is applied to multiple receiver systems for comparison of performance. Implementation of this system was originally done in C as well as MATLAB, but later is being implemented in VHDL with simulations done for verification of functionality...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — An analysis-based {{framework}} for the rapid development of a radio receiver for signals with unknown parameters is pro-posed, exploiting the reconfiguration capabilities of FPGAs. The framework guides a non-expert user through the proc-ess of signal classification and FPGA-based receiver im-plementation. System efficiency is traded off with imple-mentation {{time in order to}} allow fast radio creation. A set of high-level transformations are applied to the unknown sig-nal based on different hypothesis about the modulation scheme. The results of the transformations are presented to the user, who can steer the process of analysis. The parame-ters of the radio are then mapped by means of an Implemen-tation Engine to modules implemented in a <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> FPGA-based <b>receiver.</b> I...|$|R
40|$|Agriculture is {{the sector}} with the {{greatest}} water consumption, since food production is frequently based on crop irrigation. Proper irrigation management requires reliable information on plant water status, but all the plant-based methods to determine it suffer from several inconveniences, mainly caused by the necessity of destructive sampling or of alteration of the plant organ due to contact installation. The aim of this work is to test if THz time domain reflectance measurements made on the grapevine trunk allows contactless monitoring of plant status. The experiments were performed on a potted 14 -years old plant, using a <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> THz emitter <b>receiver</b> head. Trunk THz time-domain reflection signal proved to be very sensitive to changes in plant water availability, as its pattern follows the trend of soil water content and trunk growth variations. Therefore, {{it could be used}} to contactless monitor plant water status. Apart from that, THz reflection signal was observed to respond to light conditions which, according to a specifically designed girdling experiment, was caused by changes in the phloem. This latter results opens a promising field of research for contactless monitoring of phloem activity...|$|R
