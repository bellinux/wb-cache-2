25|$|Another way to {{increase}} the yield of the reaction would be to remove the product (i.e. ammonia gas) from the system.

The hot gases are cooled enough, whilst maintaining a high pressure, for the ammonia to condense and be removed as liquid.

40|$|A fast {{ultrafiltration}} {{method is}} described for quantitative studying of protein-ligand interactions at equilibrium. This protocol is aimed for student {{studies in the}} laboratory. Bovine serum albumin is allowed to complex with phenol red dye at various concentration ratios {{in a series of}} tests.

The dye concentrations in the filtrates are determined by spectrophotometry, thus establishing the concentrations of free dye in equilibrium with protein bound dye in each case. In combination with knowledge of the protein concentration and the total amount of dye in each case, it is possible to evaluate the number of bound phenol red molecules per protein molecule. In a typical experiment a saturation curve, and a Scatchard plot were constructed using results from 10 different <b>equilibrium</b> <b>mixtures.</b> The results typically show that a total of 13 - 14 phenol red molecules bind to serumalbumin by two interacting sites with different binding constants...|$|R

40|$|Study of the {{stereochemistry}} of lignins constitutes {{one approach}} to the elucidation of the biosynthesis of lignins. Results from stereochemical studies directed {{to an understanding of}} lignin biosynthesis are summarized. The distribution of the diastereomeric forms of different types of structural elements in lignins was determined. It can be expected that the distribution of diastereomers is unaffected during the isolation of lignin or that an equilibration occurs during this procedure. The compositions of <b>equilibrium</b> <b>mixtures</b> of representative lignin model compounds, obtained by acid-catalysed equilibration, were therefore determined. The results showed that the distribution of diastereomers in lignins differs from that of the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>mixtures</b> but agrees fairly well with that found in reaction mixtures obtained on oxidation of p -hydroxycinnamyl alcohols in vitro. These results reinforce the opinion that “random” polymerization of p -hydroxycinnamyl alcohols via radicals plays a role in the biosynthesis of lignins. Aiming at an elucidation of the “secondary structure” of lignins the conformation of a variety of crystalline lignin models was determined by X-ray crystallography. It was found that the bulky aromatic groups in many cases tend to be far apart from each other in the conformations adopted. This suggests that repulsion between aromatic groups plays a role. However, it is evident that other factors also influence the conformations of the model compounds examined...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTau is a microtubule-associated protein, {{which plays}} an {{important}} role in physiology and pathology of neurons. Tau has been recently reported to bind double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) but not to bind single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) [Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003, 60, 413 – 421]. Here, we prove that tau binds not only dsDNA but also ssDNA. This finding was facilitated by using two kinetic capillary electrophoresis methods: (i) non-equilibrium capillary electrophoresis of <b>equilibrium</b> <b>mixtures</b> (NECEEM); (ii) affinity-mediated NECEEM. Using the new approach, we observed, for the first time, that tau could induce dissociation of strands in dsDNA by binding one of them in a sequence-specific fashion.

Internal consistency requires that all values of the thermodynamic functions are correctly calculated by application of the appropriate thermodynamic equations.
