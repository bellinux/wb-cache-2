50|$|Mounted {{search and}} rescue (MSAR) is a {{specialty}} within {{search and rescue}} (SAR), using horses as search partners and for transportation to search for missing persons. SAR responders on horseback are primarily a search resource, but also can provide off-road logistics support and transportation.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we will {{describe}} a data collection methodology and reference data set {{that can be}} used by the indoor navigation community to verify and improve algorithms based on <b>foot</b> <b>mounted</b> inertial sensors. The data set is collected using a high precision optical reference system that is traditionally used in the film industry for human motion capturing or in specialist applications such as analysis of human motion in sports and medical rehabilitation. The data provides synchronous 6 degrees of freedom inertial measurement sensor readings from a <b>foot</b> <b>mounted</b> MEMS sensor array as well as the high resolution data from the optical tracking system providing location and orientation ground truth. We will also provide the results of algorithms that identify the rest phase during the human gait cycle which {{is an essential part of}} pedestrian dead reckoning systems for positioning...|$|E

The approach requires only minimal fingerprinting effort since the high accuracy is achieved by the support of the inertial-based step estimation in the overall estimation process...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In rescue {{missions}} or {{law enforcement}} applications, accurate determination of every team member’s position and providing this {{information on a}} map may significantly improve mutual situation awareness and potentially {{reduce the risk of}} accidentally harming a team member. Furthermore, it could help keep track of the areas that have been already visited, helping the coordination of the mission at hand. Whereas in outdoors environments accurate positioning information can be obtained using a GNSS receivers, in indoor or underground environments GNSS signals are strongly disturbed and other means of localization must be called into play. <b>Foot</b> <b>mounted</b> inertial sensors or IMUs {{have been one of the}} proposed solutions, but their performance is prone to errors that grow over time. Only when the map of the environment is provided, can these IMUs perform with high accuracy. But building plans or maps of indoor and underground areas are often unavailable, outdated, incomplete and do not reflect furniture or other obstacles that also constraint the pedestrian’s motion. How can a reliable map of an indoor environment be generated? FootSLAM- Simultaneous Localization and Mapping for pedestrians- is a novel technique based on <b>foot</b> <b>mounted</b> IMUs that measure the pedestrian’s steps while walking. These measurements can be used to generate a map of an environment while determining the pedestrian’s location within that map. FootSLAM was recently extended to FeetSLAM, the multiuser scenario in which the maps obtained by two or more pedestrians are combined to generate a more extensive and accurate map of the environment. In this paper we elaborate on different deployment scenarios for Foot-SLAM and its collaborative counterpart in security and emergency applications, yet to be experimentally validated...|$|E
