40|$|We {{consider}} {{the impact of}} scheduling disciplines on performance of routing {{in the framework of}} adversarial queuing. We propose an adversarial model which reflects stalling of packets due to transient failures and explicitly incorporates feedback produced by a network when packets are stalled. This adversarial model provides a methodology to study stability of routing protocols when flow-control and congestion-control mechanisms affect the volume of traffic. We show that any scheduling policy that is universally stable, in the regular model of routing that additionally allows packets to have two priorities, remains stable in the proposed adversarial model. <b>Contract</b> <b>grant</b> sponsor: NSF; <b>Contract</b> <b>grant</b> number: 1016847 (B.

40|$|Writ {{factors are}} {{secreted}} ligands that affect {{different aspects of}} the nervous system behavior like neurodevelopment, synaptogenesis and neurodegeneration. In different model systems, Wnt signaling has been demonstrated to be regulated by heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). Whether HSPGs modulate Writ signaling in the context of neuronal behavior is currently unknown. Here we demonstrate that activation of Wnt signaling with the endogenous ligand Wnt- 7 a results in an increased of neurite outgrowth in the neuroblastoma N 2 a cell line. Interestingly, heparin induces glycogen synthase kinase- 3 beta (GSK- 3 beta) inhibition, beta-catenin stabilization and morphological differentiation in both N 2 a cells and in rat primary hippocampal neuronal cultures. We also show that heparin modulates Wnt- 3 a-induced stabilization of beta-catenin. Several extracellular matrix and membrane-attached HSPGs were found to be expressed in both in vitro neuronal models. Changes in the expression of specific HSPGs were observed upon differentiation of N 2 a cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that HSPGs may modulate canonical Writ signaling for neuronal morphogenesis. <b>Contract</b> <b>grant</b> sponsor: FONDAP; <b>Contract</b> <b>grant</b> number: 139800001. <b>Contract</b> <b>grant</b> sponsor: Millennium Institute for Fundamental and Applied Biology (MIFAB). <b>Contract</b> <b>grant</b> sponsor: Anillo PBCT; <b>Contract</b> <b>grant</b> number: ACT- 02. <b>Contract</b> <b>grant</b> sponsor: DIUC-UdeC; <b>Contract</b> <b>grant</b> number: 204. 031. 098 - 1. 0...|$|R

40|$|Raman and surface-enhanced Raman {{scattering}} (SERS) {{spectra of}} the synthetic carboxy terminal peptide of human chorionic gonadatropin β-subunit free of carbohydrate moieties (P 37) are reported. The spectral analysis is {{performed on the}} basis of our reported Raman spectrum and SERS data of oligopeptides displaying selected amino acids sequences MRKDV, ADEDRDA, and LGRGISL. SERS samples of P 37 were prepared by coating the solid peptide with metal colloids on a quartz slide. This treatment makes possible to obtain high spectral batch to batch reproducibility. Amino acids components of P 37 display net charges and hydrophobic characteristics, which are related to particular structural aspects of the adsorbate-substrate interaction. The spectroscopic results are supported by quantum chemical calculations performed by using extended Hückel theory method for a model of P 37 interacting with an Ag surface. The P 37 -metal interaction is drove by positively charged fragments of selected amino acids, mainly threonine 109, lysine 122, and arginine in positions 114 and 133.

40|$|The {{transcription}} factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein δ (C/EBPδ) regulates transcription of genes that play {{important roles in}} glial activation. Previous studies have shown the astroglial expression of C/EBPδ but the microglial expression of C/EBPδ remains virtually unexplored, {{with the exception of}} two microarray studies. In this report, using murine primary cultures and BV 2 cells we clearly demonstrate that C/EBPδ is expressed by microglia and it is upregulated in microglial activation. Lipopolysaccharide upregulates C/EBPδ both in microglia and in astrocytes. This effect is time-dependent, with a maximum effect at 3 hr at mRNA level and at 4 - 8 hr at protein level, and concentration-dependent, with a maximum effect at 100 ng/mL. The lipopolysaccharide-induced C/EBPδ upregulation in BV 2 microglia is mimicked by agonists of the toll-like receptors 2, 3 and 9 and can be prevented by an inhibitor of extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation. C/EBPδ from activated BV 2 microglia binds to the cyclooxygenase- 2 promoter and forms complexes with C/EBPβ isoforms. These results point to C/EBPδ as a putative key regulator of proinflammatory gene expression in microglial activation. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc. <b>Contract</b> <b>grant</b> sponsor: Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Spanish Ministry of Health; <b>Contract</b> <b>grant</b> number: PI 040778; <b>Contract</b> <b>grant</b> sponsor: Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Spanish Ministry of Health; <b>Contract</b> <b>grant</b> number: PI 050658; <b>Contract</b> <b>grant</b> sponsor: Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Spanish Ministry of Health; <b>Contract</b> <b>grant</b> number: PI 070455; <b>Contract</b> <b>grant</b> sponsor: Fundació Marató-TV 3; <b>Contract</b> <b>grant</b> number: V- 2006 -TV 063031 -O; <b>Contract</b> <b>grant</b> sponsor: IDIBAPS (to AEO); <b>Contract</b> <b>grant</b> sponsor: CSIC; <b>Contract</b> <b>grant</b> number: I 3 P (to NG and MS).

40|$|Atorvastatin (ATV), a 3 -hydroxy 3 -methylglutaryl {{coenzyme}} A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, exerts {{beneficial effects}} on stroke through several pleiotropic mechanisms. However, its role following cerebral ischemia {{is not completely}} understood yet. We evaluated the effect of ATV treatment on the synaptic adhesion proteins after a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (t-MCAO) model in rats. Ischemic male Wistar rats were treated with 10 mg/kg ATV. The first dose was 6 hr after reperfusion, then every 24 hr for 3 days. Our findings showed that ATV treatment produced an increase in pAkt ser 473 {{and a decrease in}} pMAPK 44 / 42 protein levels 12 and 24 hr postischemia in the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus. However, p 120 catenin and αN-catenin became drastically increased throughout the temporal course of postischemia treatment (12 – 72 hr), mainly in the hippocampus. Neurological recovery was observed at 48 and 72 hr, supported by a significant reduction of infarct volume, neuronal loss, and glial hyperreactivity after 72 hr of postischemia treatment with ATV. ATV treatment also up-regulated the association of p 120 ctn, αN-catenin to PSD- 95, accompanied by a reduction of RhoA activation and the recovery of MAP 2 immunoreactivity, these being significantly affected by the focal cerebral ischemia. Our findings suggested that p 120 ctn and αN-catenin synaptic adhesion proteins are crucial molecular targets in ATV-mediated neuroprotection and neuronal plasticity after focal cerebral ischemia. <b>Contract</b> <b>grant</b> sponsor: Colciencias; <b>Contract</b> <b>grant</b> number: 11150416372; <b>Contract</b> <b>grant</b> number: 111545921467; <b>Contract</b> <b>grant</b> sponsor: CODI, University of Antioquia, Colombia; <b>Contract</b> <b>grant</b> sponsor: ALFA Project; <b>Contract</b> <b>grant</b> number: II 0322 FA-FCD-FI-FC; <b>Contract</b> <b>grant</b> sponsor: CIBERNED (an ISCIII initiative; to F.
