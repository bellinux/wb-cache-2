40|$|Changes in {{the area}} of volume of polar ice sheets are {{intricately}} linked to changes in global climate and may severely impact the densely populated coastal regions on Earth. An ice sheet's velocity is a critical parameter, which, together with ice thickness, allows the determination of discharge rates. Using moderate-resolution satellite images such as Landsat, the velocity of floating ice can be measured quickly and relatively inexpensively by tracing crevasse patterns on shelves and <b>ice</b> <b>tongues.</b> Errors in measured velocities are as little as 0. 02 km per year, if the following criteria are met: (1) the time interval is longer than 10 years; (2) the velocity is higher than 0. 5 km per year; (3) the coregistration points are well dispersed and enclose the area to be measured; and (4) the image pair includes a Landsat 4 or 5 image.

50|$|Glaciation {{advanced}} and retreated along the creek valley {{in the late}} Pleistocene Epoch until about 17,500 years ago, although the exact details are debated. The main <b>ice</b> <b>tongues</b> split near modern-day Brooktondale, resulting in different hydrogeology between the upper valley, from the headwaters to Brooktondale, and the lower valley between Brooktondale and the outlet. Much of the upper valley is characterized by steep gorge walls. Because the lower valley was filled with sediments as the glaciers retreated, the new channel initially flowed without regard to its pre-glacial location. Over time, it washed away sediment filling pre-glacial gorges in some places, whereas in other reaches it cut into the bedrock to create new post-glacial gorges. As the post-glacial gorges are narrower than the re-excavated pre-glacial gorges, the lower valley takes on the appearance of beads on a string.|$|R

The dynamics of the group of three valley and outlet glaciers, the Tinker Glacier, Aviator Glacier and Parker Glacier, is clearly shown in the investigated depositional features that include subglacial and proglacial progradational deposits, grounding zone wedges, a possible morainal bank complex, and in the erosional evidence of glacial unconformities and troughs...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION The Mertz Glacier in East Antarctica (Fig. 1) with {{a length}} of the {{floating}} part of about 90 kilometers {{is one of the}} largest <b>ice</b> <b>tongues</b> in Antarctica. One interesting feature of such a glacier is the grounding line which is the transition of grounded to floating ice. This transition is associated with a flexure of the ice body to adjust between the vertical motion caused by ocean tides at the free floating tongue and the grounded part which is not moved by ocean tides. This phenomenon can be observed by various techniques, e. g. kinematic GPS [1], tilt measurements [2] and SAR interferometry [3], where the latter gives a unique spatial information. As SAR interferometry reveales the total effect of deformation the vertical motion due to ocean tides is superimposed by horizontal ice flow. This makes it difficult to detect the grounding line of fast flowing glaciers like the Mertz Glacier. We propose a method to use interferograms of adjacent tracks to derive the groundi...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Mendenhall Glacier is a lake-calving glacier {{in southeastern}} Alaska, USA, that is {{experiencing}} substantial thinning and increasingly rapid recession. Long-term mass wastage linked to climatic trends {{is responsible for}} thinning of the lower glacier and leaving the terminus vulnerable to buoyancy-driven calving and accelerated retreat. Bedrock topography has {{played a major role}} in stabilizing the terminus between periods of rapid calving and retreat. Lake-terminating glaciers form a population distinct from both tidewater glaciers and polar <b>ice</b> <b>tongues,</b> with some similarities to both groups. Lacustrine termini experience fewer perturbations (e. g. tidal flexure, high subaqueous melt rates) and are therefore inherently more stable than tidewater termini. At Mendenhall, rapid thinning and simultaneous retreat into a deeper basin led to flotation conditions along approximately 50 % of the calving front. This unstable terminus geometry lasted for approximately 2 years and culminated in largescale calving and terminus collapse during summer 2004. Buoyancy-driven calving events and terminus break-up can result from small, rapidly applied perturbations in lake level. 1...|$|R

40|$|Antarctica is {{surrounded}} by a variety of large, medium and small sized <b>ice</b> shelves, glacier <b>tongues</b> and coastal areas without offshore floating ice masses. We used the mosaic of the Radarsat- 1 Antarctica Mapping Project (RAMP) Antarctic Mapping Mission 1 (AMM) to classify the coastline of Antarctica in terms of surface structure patterns close to the calving front. With the aid of an automated edge detection method, complemented by manual control, the surface structures of all ice shelves and glacier tongues around Antarctica were mapped. We found dense and less dense patterns of surface structures unevenly distributed over the ice shelves and <b>ice</b> <b>tongues.</b> Dense surface patterns are frequent on fast flowing ice masses (ice streams), whereas most ice shelves show a dense surface pattern only close to the grounding line. Flow line analyses on ten ice shelves reveal that the time of residence of the ice along a flow path and—associated with it—the healing of surface crevasses can explain the different surface structure distribution close to the grounding line and the calving front on many ice shelves. Based on the surface structures relative to the calving front within a 15 km-wide seaward strip, the ice shelf fronts can be separated into three classes. The resulting map of the classified calving fronts around Antarctica and their description provide a detailed picture of crevasse formation and the observed dominant iceberg shapes...|$|R
