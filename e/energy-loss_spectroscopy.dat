Due to the symmetry-breaking effect at the surface on the adsorbed C 60 molecules, a new IR band is observed at 1445 cm- 1 which is mainly s-polarised. No evidence for chemical interaction between C 60 and H/Si(111) -(1 x 1) is found, pointing to van der Waals-type bonding.

40|$|We have {{calculated}} the plasmon modes in graphene double layer structures at finite temperatures, {{taking into account}} the inhomogeneity of the dielectric background of the system. The effective dielectric function is obtained from the solution of the Poisson equation of three-layer dielectric medium with the graphene sheets located at the interfaces, separating the different materials. Due to the momentum dispersion of the effective dielectric function, the intra- and inter-layer bare Coulomb interactions in the graphene double layer system acquires an additional momentum dependence [...] an effect that is of the order of the inter-layer interaction itself. We show that the energies of the in-phase and out-of-phase plasmon modes are determined largely by different values of the spatially dependent effective dielectric function. The effect of the dielectric inhomogeneity increases with temperature and even at high temperatures the energy shift induced by the dielectric inhomogeneity and temperature itself remains larger than the broadening of the plasmon energy dispersions due to the Landau damping.

40|$|The steps {{involved}} in early bone mineralisation have been extensively studied. Studies have suggested various {{means by which}} bone mineralisation occurs: (1) a cell-independent (protein-assisted) process where non-collagenous proteins mediate soluble ions to form mineral on the collagen fibril; (2) a cell-controlled mechanism where mineral seeds formed within intracellular vesicles released from the plasma membrane would subsequently rupture and disperse their contents on the extracellular matrix; and (3) an acellular route in which amorphous calcium phosphate mineral precursors are produced and deposited in collagen fibrils where they transform into more crystalline apatite platelets. Despite extensive studies, there are still unanswered questions about how bone becomes bone. The first series of experiments in this thesis are aimed at studying the mineral characteristics of early in vitro osteoblast mineralisation at the extracellular matrix. These experiments seek to determine the sequence of possible mineralisation events that take place during mineral nucleation and growth on collagen. Transmission electron microscopy was used to provide high spatial resolution, which was compounded with chemical analysis of energy dispersive x-ray and electron <b>energy-loss</b> <b>spectroscopies.</b> We identified carbonate-rich calcium phosphate dense granules in the extracellular matrix that may act as seeds for growth into larger, submicron-sized, globular aggregates of apatite mineral with a different stoichiometry. These globules appear to mineralise the collagen fibrils forming crystalline textured crystals with higher calcium-to-phosphate ratio and lower carbonate content as the mineral phase of bone. We provide new evidence {{that the use of}} a carbonate rich, amorphous calcium phosphate spherical bioseed could be a process by which a soluble calcium phosphate phase is stabilised and delivered to the collagen for subsequent maturation and collagen mineralisation. We also examined the effect of strontium ion supplementation to bone mineralisation as a translational study. Previous studies showed the positive effects of in vivo strontium supplementation as an anti-osteoporotic drug. Strontium is able to: (1) stimulate bone formation; (2) increase osteoid surface, osteoblast surface, and bone forming surfaces; (3) decrease bone resorbing cells; (4) increase bone strength and mass; and (5) reduce the risk of fractures. In the in vitro system, studies have focused on how strontium ions increase bone mineral???s a- and c-axis lattice parameters. The effect of strontium ions on the matrix component of bone is the aim for the second part of this thesis. Using Raman spectroscopy, TEM imaging, and biochemical quantification, we studied the effect of strontium ion supplementation on in vitro MC 3 T 3 osteoblasts, with close focus on the osteoblast matrix. We observed that cultures treated with high strontium supplementation had impaired mineralisation, where nodules were formed but failed to mineralise. Periodic collagen banding was seen on TEM micrograph from all treatments. Collagen organisation was quantified using image analysis of TEM micrograph, and strontium supplementation seemed to affect fibril organisation. A slight addition of 0. 1 mM strontium seemed to result in the less random organisation of collagen fibril, while 3 mM supplementation seemed to increase the random organisation. Only cultures treated with the highest amount of strontium supplementation showed an abundance of matrix vesicles around the collagen fibrils. Raman spectroscopy showed an increase in lipid detection on strontium supplemented groups, which {{may be due to the}} increased presence of matrix vesicles. Taken together, high strontium supplementation may decrease the rate of degradation of matrix vesicles and lead to altered mineralisation whereby nodules form but fail to mineralise. The relative amounts of collagen were also explored by Raman spectroscopy and hydroxyproline analysis; however, our findings were not statistically significant. Further experiments are needed to more completely elucidate the molecular mechanisms at play in strontium???s effect on bone mineralisation. Open Acces...|$|R
