5000|$|Multiplex ligation-dependent probe {{amplification}} [...] (MLPA)http://www.mlpa.com is {{a variation}} of the multiplex polymerase chain reaction that permits amplification of multiple targets with only a single primer pair. Each probe consists of two oligonucleotides which recognize adjacent target sites on the DNA. One probe oligonucleotide contains the sequence recognized by the <b>forward</b> <b>primer,</b> the other contains the sequence recognized by the reverse primer. Only when both probe oligonucleotides are hybridized to their respective targets, can they be ligated into a complete probe. The advantage of splitting the probe into two parts is that only the ligated oligonucleotides, but not the unbound probe oligonucleotides, are amplified. If the probes were not split in this way, the primer sequences at either end would cause the probes to be amplified regardless of their hybridization to the template DNA, and the amplification product would not be dependent on the number of target sites present in the sample DNA. Each complete probe has a unique length, so that its resulting amplicons can be separated and identified by (capillary) electrophoresis. This avoids the resolution limitations of multiplex PCR. Because the <b>forward</b> <b>primer</b> used for probe amplification is fluorescently labeled, each amplicon generates a fluorescent peak which can be detected by a capillary sequencer. Comparing the peak pattern obtained on a given sample with that obtained on various reference samples, the relative quantity of each amplicon can be determined.

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{critical}} steps in the SELEX procedure is obtaining single stranded DNA (ssDNA) after the PCR amplification step. This will serve as input for the next cycle so it is of vital importance that all the DNA is single stranded and as little as possible is lost. Because of the relative simplicity, one {{of the most}} used methods is using biotinylated reverse primers in the amplification step, after which the complementary strands can be bound to a resin followed by elution of the other strand with lye. Another method is asymmetric PCR, where the amplification step is performed with an excess of <b>forward</b> <b>primer</b> and very little reverse primer, which leads to the production of more of the desired strand. A drawback of this method is that the product should be purified from double stranded DNA (dsDNA) and other left-over material from the PCR reaction. Enzymatic degradation of the unwanted strand can be performed by tagging this strand using a phosphate-probed primer, as it is recognized by enzymes such as Lambda exonuclease. These enzymes then selectively degrade the phosphate tagged strand leaving the complementary strand intact. All of these methods recover approximately 50 to 70% of the DNA. For a detailed comparison refer to the article by Svobodová et al. where these, and other, methods are experimentally compared.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In an area {{of intense}} transmission, a malaria vaccine could reduce {{infection}} due to the parasite types represented in the vaccine, but have no detectable effect on the overall frequency of infection {{if it did not}} protect against infection with heterologous parasites. These studies were performed to determine whether immunization with SPf 66 decreased infection with homologous parasites containing the 11 amino acid peptide from merozoite surface protein- 1 (MSP- 1) in SPf 66, or increased infection due to heterologous parasites containing heterologous (alternative) MSP- 1 sequences. Based on this 11 amino acid peptide (YSLFQKEKMVL), three <b>forward</b> <b>primers</b> (S,Q,V) were designed to amplify the MSP- 1 sequence present in SPf 66, and 3 additional <b>forward</b> <b>primers</b> (G,H,I) to amplify the alternative MSP- 1 sequence (YGLFHKEKMIL). This strategy was validated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and dideoxy sequencing with 14 cloned laboratory isolates, which demonstrated that each primer am-plified one MSP- 1 sequence or the other, but not both. The technique was then used to examine filter paper blots from an SPf 66 vaccine study of 69 subjects in Saradidi, Kenya. In that study, the prevalence of infection with YSLFQKEKMVL or YGLFHKEKMIL type parasites was unaffected by immunization with SPf 66 (based on PCR amplification with the S, Q, V, G, H and I primers, respectively). These results suggest that immunization with SPf 66 does not produce a selective effect in vivo.

The characteristics of PCR executed on a gel-based oligonucleotide microarray with immobilized <b>forward</b> <b>primers</b> and a single common reverse primer in solution were investigated for several DNA targets. One-stage multiplex on-chip PCR was studied for simultaneous amplification of herpes simplex viruses types 1 and 2, cytomegalovirus DNA, and bacteriophage lambda DNA as an internal control. Additionally the joint analysis of increased number of targets (with addition of Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma hominis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum DNA) was done in two-stage version of assay: first stage was in-tube PCR with target-specific primers, while the reverse ones contained 5 '-adapter region; the second stage was on-chip amplification with immobilized target-specific <b>forward</b> <b>primers</b> and adapter as common reverse primer in solution. The possible application of one-stage reaction for human cDNA analysis was additionally demonstrated with utilization of a common poly-T-containing primer in solution.

The efficiencies of both one-stage and two-stage reactions was shown to be strongly dependent on magnesium and primers concentrations. Quantitative PCR in the both versions was studied with 10 -fold serial dilutions of phage lambda DNA. The method enabled detection of 6 DNA copies per reaction for both versions of assay.

40|$|Recovery of the {{mitochondrial}} COI barcode {{region in}} diverse Hexapoda through tRNA-based primers Doo-Sang Park 1, Soo-Jung Suh 3, Hyun-Woo Oh 2 and Paul DN Hebert * 4 Background: DNA barcoding uses a 650 bp {{segment of the}} mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene {{as the basis for}} an identification system for members of the animal kingdom and some other groups of eukaryotes. PCR amplification of the barcode region is a key step in the analytical chain, but it sometimes fails {{because of a lack of}} homology between the standard primer sets and target DNA. Results: Two <b>forward</b> PCR <b>primers</b> were developed following analysis of all known arthropod mitochondrial genome arrangements and sequence alignment of the tRNA-W gene which was usually located within 200 bp upstream of the COI gene. These two primers were combined with a standard reverse primer (LepR 1) to produce a cocktail which generated a barcode amplicon from 125 of 141 species that included representatives of 121 different families of Hexapoda. High quality sequences were recovered from 79 % of the species including groups, such as scale insects, that invariably fail to amplify with standard primers. Conclusions: A cocktail of two tRNA-W <b>forward</b> <b>primers</b> coupled with a standard reverse primer amplifies COI for mos...|$|R
40|$|The {{sequential}} deletion {{method is}} commonly applied {{to locate the}} functional domain of a protein. Unfortunately, manually designing primers for multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a labor-intensive task. In order to Speed LIP the experimental Procedure and to improve the efficiency of producing PCR products, this paper proposes a Multiplex PCR primers (MPCRPs) designer to design multiple <b>forward</b> <b>primers</b> with a single 3 '-UTR reverse primer for extracting various N-terminal truncated mutants to quickly locate the functional domain of a cDNA sequence. Several factors, including melting temperature, primer length, GC content, internal self-complement, cross-dimerization, terminal limitation, and specificity, are used as the criteria for designing primers. This study obtains a near-optimal solution of primer sets that can be placed in as few test tubes as possible for one multiplex PCR experiment. Results: Homo sapiens ribosomal protein L 5, Homo sapiens xylosyltransferase 1, and Bacteriophage T 4 gene product 11 were used as test examples to verify efficacy of the proposed algorithm. In addition, the designed primers of Homo sapiens ribosomal protein L 5 cDNA were applied in multiplex PCR experiments. A total of 48 <b>forward</b> <b>primers</b> and one reverse primer were designed and used to duplicate N-terminal truncated mutants of different lengths from the protein. The primers were classified into eight tube groups (i. e., test tubes) held within the same temperature range (53 - 57 C), and {{the validity of the}} PCR products were verified using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) with the functional domain correctly located. A software implementation of the proposed algorithm useful in assisting the researcher to design primers for multiplex PCR experiments was developed and available upon request. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
