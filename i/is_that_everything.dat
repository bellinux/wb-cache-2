Examples include [...] "Fix You" [...] ("When you lose something you can't replace") and also in [...] "X" [...] ("When something is broken, {{and you try to}} fix it, trying to repair it, any way you can") and [...] "Talk" [...] ("Are you lost or incomplete? Do you feel like a puzzle, you can't find your missing piece?"). This theme is also reflective of the random, incomprehensible pattern on the album's cover (until you [...] "fix" [...] it using the Baudot Code).|$|E
500|$|Pinfold's adopted {{defensive}} persona, [...] "a {{combination of}} eccentric don and testy colonel", {{was the same}} that Waugh cultivated to keep the world at bay. Pinfold adheres to an outmoded form of Toryism, does not vote, and expresses outrageous views, part-facetiously. Pinfold was [...] "absurd to many but to some rather formidable". After Waugh's death, Nancy Mitford confirmed the essentially mocking nature of Waugh's persona: [...] "What nobody remembers about Evelyn <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> with him was jokes. Everything". While Waugh's biographer Selena Hastings describes Pinfold as [...] "an accurate and revealing self-portrait", Stannard {{suggests that it is}} primarily an analysis of the adopted persona in which, like Pinfold, Waugh [...] "gives nothing away".|$|E
500|$|Stannard {{concludes that}} beneath his public mask, Waugh was [...] "a {{dedicated}} {{artist and a}} man of earnest faith, struggling against the dryness of his soul". Graham Greene, {{in a letter to}} The Times shortly after Waugh's death, acknowledged him as [...] "the greatest novelist of my generation", while Time magazine's obituarist called him [...] "the grand old mandarin of modern British prose" [...] and asserted that his novels [...] "will continue to survive {{as long as there are}} readers who can savor what critic V. S. Pritchett calls 'the beauty of his malice'". Nancy Mitford said of him in a television interview, [...] "What nobody remembers about Evelyn <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> with him was jokes. Everything. That's what none of the people who wrote about him seem to have taken into account at all".|$|E

Diodorus' view <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> has happened must <b>be</b> true, and <b>that</b> therefore nothing <b>is</b> possible which can never be true.|$|R
500|$|In July 2008, Lavigne {{launched}} the clothing line Abbey Dawn, featuring a back-to-school collection. It {{is produced by}} Kohl's, which is the brand's exclusive US retailer. Named after Lavigne's childhood nickname, Abbey Dawn is designed by Lavigne herself. Kohl's describes Abbey Dawn as a [...] "juniors lifestyle brand", which incorporates skull, zebra, and star patterns, purples and [...] "hot pinks and blacks". Lavigne, who wore some of the clothes and jewellery from her line at various concerts before its official launch, pointed {{out that she was}} not merely licensing her name to the collection. [...] "I actually am the designer. What's really important to me <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> fits well and is well-made, so I try everything on and approve it all." [...] The clothing line incorporates Lavigne's musical style and lyrics, [...] "after the release of my first album, I realized how much fashion was involved in my musical career".|$|E
500|$|During the {{beginning}} of season three, Chris Carabott from IGN described Ben as [...] "one of the best 'villains on television', due to his 'eerie manner' and 'methodical delivery'". Later in the season Carabott {{had a problem with}} Ben being so deceptive, as [...] "anything he imparts must be taken with a grain of salt". Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly also noted this, saying [...] "I don't trust Ben. I have no idea when he's lying and when he's telling the truth. The only thing I'm reasonably sure of <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> he says is for the purpose of impacting a character — and the audience". Ben's father issues revealed towards the end of season three are described as [...] "not the most original Lost character trait by any means but it is the thrust behind Ben's development into the genocidal maniac he eventually becomes". Following the penultimate episode of the season, Carabott stated [...] "Even with his limited screen time, Michael Emerson's performance shines through and we hope that he survives the events of the finale because we love seeing his character every week." [...] Erin Martell from TV Squad picked the Others as one of her season three highlights, partly due to the development of Ben, adding [...] "I cannot even picture the final three seasons without Ben". Martell also gave six reasons to look forward to season four, one of which was Ben Linus.|$|E
500|$|Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly {{said that}} Madonna {{delivered}} a [...] "joyous, unironic, openhearted" [...] show {{rather than a}} cautious performance. According to Tucker, the singer was in [...] "full command"; although the visuals lacked flow, the song transitions meshed [...] "perfectly". Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph called the show a [...] "tribute to Madonna" [...] and a [...] "shameless" [...] promotion of the singer's return to the music scene after directing W.E.: [...] "The message [...] {{is that she is}} back in business. I suspect she’d settle for a global number one over global harmony". Troy Patterson of Slate wrote that Madonna retained her [...] "greatest marketing agent" [...] title with the show and praised its costumes, sets and the singer's repeated self-referencing. Linda Holmes of NPR said, [...] "What's curious, given how much 'ewww, she's too old' stuff went around on Twitter, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> she did Sunday night is exactly what it should mean to age gracefully". Miriam Coleman of Rolling Stone called the show a [...] "serious spectacle", and Mario Tarradell of The Dallas Morning News called it a [...] "high-concept music video": [...] "Madonna brilliantly manipulates the combined impact of visuals and sonics. The 13-minute performance was an eye-popping marvel". A Huffington Post reviewer wrote, [...] "Love her or hate her, there's no doubt that only Madonna can bring a certain level of pop flair to a performance". Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic praised the show's choreography and cinematography: [...] "With so, so much to look at, Madonna remained the center of attention. That is, until the end, when white light and smoke engulfed her and she dropped down through the stage, out of sight". According to Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle, Madonna controlled her nerves and he liked her selection of songs.|$|E

2500|$|The Geek Code is {{a series}} of letters and symbols used by {{self-described}} [...] "geeks" [...] to inform fellow geeks about their personality, appearance, interests, skills, and opinions.

2500|$|Academics {{showed little}} {{interest}} in this topic until recently. This was not, however, the case with popular writers from non-conforming backgrounds, who interspersed the text of Revelation with the prophecy they thought was being promised. For example, an anonymous Scottish commentary of 1871 prefaces Revelation 4 with the Little Apocalypse of Mark 13, places Malachi 4:5 ("Behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before {{the coming of the}} great and dreadful day of the Lord") within Revelation 11 and writes Revelation 12:7 side-by-side with the role of [...] "the Satan" [...] in the Book of Job.

2500|$|Similarly, the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch {{read the}} words of [...] "And surely your blood of your lives will I require," [...] to support the {{proposition}} that one who commits suicide is considered an evildoer of the highest degree. For God created {{the world for a}} single individual, Adam, so anyone who destroys a soul destroys a whole world. The Kitzur Shulchan Aruch therefore taught that Jews should not carry out for one who committed suicide anything to honor that person, but Jews should bury the body after cleansing and dressing it in a shroud. The principle <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> for honoring the living relatives should be done for them, as opposed to for the honor of the person who committed suicide.|$|E

RAW had reportedly decided to have closer ties to Mossad, and the subsequent secret operation was approved by then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. India Today cites [...] "RAW insiders" [...] as saying that RAW agents hid a Mossad agent holding an Argentine passport and exchanged intelligence and expertise in operations, including negotiations {{for the release of}} an Israeli tourist by the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front militants in June 1991. When asked about the case Verma refused to speak about the companies, but claimed his relationship with them was purely professional. Raman stated, [...] "Sometimes, spy agencies float companies for operational reasons. All I can say <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> was done with government approval.
