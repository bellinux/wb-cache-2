5|$|Edward Norton, around 1930, {{designed}} a mechanical filter {{for use on}} phonograph recorders and players. Norton designed the filter in the electrical domain and then used the correspondence of mechanical quantities to electrical quantities to realise the filter using mechanical components. Mass corresponds to inductance, stiffness to elastance and damping to resistance. The filter was designed to have a maximally <b>flat</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>response.</b>|$|E
5|$|The NS-10 {{does not}} have a {{perfectly}} <b>flat</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>response.</b> The sound of the NS-10 is slightly heavy in the midrange, and like other sealed-box speakers of similar size its bass extension is limited. It has a +5dB boost in the midrange at around 2kHz, and the bottom end starts rolling off at 200Hz. The midrange response is so open that it exposes the frequencies that are the most problematic and worst-sounding to the human ear.|$|E
5|$|Some systems use {{parametric}} equalization in {{an attempt}} to correct for room frequency response irregularities. Equalization is often unable to achieve <b>flat</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>response</b> at all listening locations {{in part because of the}} resonance (i.e., standing wave) patterns at low frequencies in nearly all rooms. Careful positioning of the subwoofer within the room can also help flatten the frequency response. Multiple subwoofers can manage a flatter general response since they can often be arranged to excite room modes more evenly than a single subwoofer, allowing equalization to be more effective.|$|E

5000|$|A {{component}} {{having a}} 'flat' <b>frequency</b> <b>response</b> {{will not change}} the weighting (i.e., intensity) of signal content across the specified frequency range. The frequency range often specified for audio components is between 20 Hz to 20 kHz, which broadly reflects the human hearing range (the highest audible frequency for most people is less than 20 kHz, with 16 kHz being more typical [...] ). Components with 'flat' <b>frequency</b> <b>responses</b> are often described as being linear. Most audio components {{are designed to be}} linear across their entire operating range. Well-designed solid-state amplifiers and CD players may have a <b>frequency</b> <b>response</b> that varies by only 0.2 dB between 20 Hz to 20 kHz. Loudspeakers tend to have a considerably less <b>flat</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>responses</b> than this.|$|R
5|$|The basic {{technical}} {{reason for this}} difficulty is that the frequency response of a simple filter approaches a fall of 6 dB/octave far {{from the point of}} resonance. This means that if telephone channels are squeezed in side-by-side into the frequency spectrum, there will be crosstalk from adjacent channels in any given channel. What is required is a much more sophisticated filter that has a <b>flat</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>response</b> in the required passband like a low-Q resonant circuit, but that rapidly falls in response (much faster than 6dB/octave) at the transition from passband to stopband like a high-Q resonant circuit. Obviously, these are contradictory requirements to be met with a single resonant circuit. The solution to these needs was founded in the theory of transmission lines and consequently the necessary filters did not become available until this theory was fully developed. At this early stage the idea of signal bandwidth, and hence the need for filters to match to it, was not fully understood; indeed, it was as late as 1920 before the concept of bandwidth was fully established. For early radio, the concepts of Q-factor, selectivity and tuning sufficed. This was all to change with the developing theory of transmission lines on which image filters are based, as explained in the next section.|$|E
5|$|An early {{application}} of these new theoretical tools was in phonographic sound reproduction. A recurring problem with early phonograph designs was that mechanical resonances in the pickup and sound transmission mechanism caused excessively large peaks and troughs in the frequency response, resulting in poor sound quality. In 1923, Harrison of the Western Electric Company filed a patent for a phonograph in which the mechanical design was entirely represented as an electrical circuit. The horn of the phonograph is represented as a transmission line, and is a resistive load {{for the rest of}} the circuit, while all the mechanical and acoustic parts—from the pickup needle through to the horn—are translated into lumped components according to the impedance analogy. The circuit arrived at is a ladder topology of series resonant circuits coupled by shunt capacitors. This can be viewed as a bandpass filter circuit. Harrison designed the component values of this filter to have a specific passband corresponding to the desired audio passband (in this case 100Hz to 6kHz) and a flat response. Translating these electrical element values back into mechanical quantities provided specifications for the mechanical components in terms of mass and stiffness, which in turn could be translated into physical dimensions for their manufacture. The resulting phonograph has a <b>flat</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>response</b> in its passband and is free of the resonances previously experienced. Shortly after this, Harrison filed another patent using the same methodology on telephone transmit and receive transducers.|$|E

40|$|Low {{frequencies}} {{in small}} rooms {{are a problem}} that can affect the sound quality and therefore give an impaired listening experience if not treated. Even the slightest change of the subwoofer position can make a difference. Measurements have been made for two different subwoofer positions in a small control room, called the original and the alternative position. The original position represents the position that is normally used for the chosen control room. The alternative position was selected by measuring the position that had the <b>flattest</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>response.</b> The positions were tested with listening tests by 20 audio engineering students to see what differences existed between the two.

30|$|Most {{existing}} cooperative diversity research {{assumes that}} the fading channels have <b>flat</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>responses.</b> In high data-rate wireless applications, however, the coherence bandwidth of the channels tends to be smaller than the bandwidth of the signal, resulting in frequency selective fading [14]. For such high rate communication in cooperative relay networks, existing techniques for flat fading channels need to be adapted, or new techniques need to be designed for frequency selective fading channels. In [15], the authors considered a system with a single amplify-and-forward (AF) relay over frequency selective channels, and proposed three DSTCs. In [16], the authors consider a multiple-AF-relay OFDM system and proposed a distributed space-frequency code. The three DSTCs in [15] and the distributed space-frequency code in [16] can achieve both cooperative diversity and frequency diversity where the frequency diversity through a relay {{is up to the}} minimum of the source-relay channel length and the relay-destination channel length. Simpler, non-DSTC approaches that employ relay selection have been proposed for communication through frequency-selective fading channels. For example, in [17, 18], uncoded OFDM is studied, and it was shown that if relay selection is done on a per-subcarrier basis, full spatial diversity can be achieved. However, neither of these OFDM-based relay selection methods were able to exploit the frequency diversity of the ISI channel [19]. A linearly precoded OFDM system was proposed in [20] which uses multiple amplify-forward relays with linear transmit precoding; a simulation-based study showed that two relay selection schemes exhibited a coding gain improvement compared to an orthogonal round-robbin relaying scheme.|$|R
40|$|Time-stretched analog-to-digital {{converters}} (ADCs) {{have offered}} revolutionary enhancements {{in the performance}} of electronic converters by reducing the signal bandwidth prior to digitization. An inherent limitation of the time-stretched ADC is the frequency-selective response of the optical system that reduces the effective number of bits for ultrawideband signals. This paper proposes a solution based on spatio-temporal digital processing. The digital algorithm exploits the optical phase diversity to create a <b>flat</b> RF <b>frequency</b> <b>response,</b> even when the system's transfer function included deep nulls within the signal spectrum. For a 10 x time-stretch factor with a 10 -GHz input signal, simulations show that the proposed solution increases the overall achievable signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio to 52 dB in the presence of linear distortions. The proposed filter can be used to mitigate the dispersion penalty in other fiber optic applications as well...|$|R
