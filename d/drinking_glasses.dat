25|$|Many {{applications}} of silicate glasses derive from their optical transparency, {{giving rise to}} their primary use as window panes. Glass will transmit, reflect and refract light; these qualities can be enhanced by cutting and polishing to make optical lenses, prisms, fine glassware, and optical fibers for high speed data transmission by light. Glass can be coloured by adding metallic salts, and can also be painted and printed with vitreous enamels. These qualities {{have led to the}} extensive use of glass in the manufacture of art objects and in particular, stained glass windows. Although brittle, silicate glass is extremely durable, and many examples of glass fragments exist from early glass-making cultures. Because glass can be formed or moulded into any shape, it has been traditionally used for vessels: bowls, vases, bottles, jars and <b>drinking</b> <b>glasses.</b> In its most solid forms it has also been used for paperweights, marbles, and beads. When extruded as glass fiber and matted as glass wool in a way to trap air, it becomes a thermal insulating material, and when these glass fibers are embedded into an organic polymer plastic, they are a key structural reinforcement part of the composite material fiberglass. Some objects historically were so commonly made of silicate glass that they are simply called by the name of the material, such as <b>drinking</b> <b>glasses</b> and eyeglasses.|$|E

In 1955, two years after the start of television in Flanders, an animated adventure of Suske en Wiske was broadcast every Saturday afternoon.

To commemorate the victory, Rymkus ordered thousands of <b>drinking</b> <b>glasses</b> emblazoned with a picture of his face and gave them to friends.|$|E

[...] Using viewer feedback, Valve tailored the ad content until they {{were satisfied with the}} results. The ads took eight weeks to complete. Valve also developed online promotional videos featuring J. K. Simmons narrating as Cave Johnson, to promote new elements of Portal 2s gameplay. These videos were part of a larger effort described by Newell as a [...] "documentary-style investment opportunity" [...] for Portal 2. An earlier video released on February 14, 2011, promoted the cooperative aspect of Portal 2 as a St.Valentine's gift and [...] "lit up our preorders, our buzz, all the metrics that are used and collected by publishers and retailers". Lombardi said the videos [...] "dwarfed the demos and interviews we did". Valve also offered Portal 2-themed merchandise, such as posters, <b>drinking</b> <b>glasses,</b> and T-shirts.|$|E

Some of the original foundation stones are over twenty-four inches (600mm) in diameter. The initial course of the sandstone superstructure was intact along the southern foundation, and was two feet (600mm) thick.

6000|$|Nota Bene.--When one {{is on the}} Road it {{is above}} all things {{necessary}} to [...] "pass the time o' day" [...] to fellow-wanderers. Failure to comply with this law implies that the offender is [...] "too good for his company"; and this, on the Road, is the unpardonable sin. The Englishman [...] "passed the time o' day" [...] in due and ample form. [...] "Ha! Ha!" [...] said the gentleman with the bag. [...] "Isn't this a sweet place? There ain't no ticca-gharies, and there ain't nothing to eat, if you haven't brought your vittles, an' they charge you three-eight {{for a bottle of}} whisky. Oh! it's a sweet place." [...] Here he skipped about the verandah and puffed. Then turning upon the Englishman, he said fiercely: [...] "What have you come here for?" [...] Now this was rude, because the ordinary form of salutation on the Road is usually [...] "And what are you for?" [...] meaning [...] "what house do you represent?" [...] The Englishman answered dolefully that he was travelling for pleasure, which simple explanation offended the little man with the courier-bag. He snapped his joints more excruciatingly than ever: [...] "For pleasure? My God! For pleasure? Come here an' wait five weeks for your money, an', mark what I'm tellin' you now, you don't get it then! But per'aps your ideas of pleasure is different from most people's. For pleasure! Yah!" [...] He skipped across the sands toward the station, for he was going back with the down train, and vanished in a whirlwind of luggage and the fluttering of female skirts: in Jodhpur the women are baggage coolies. A level, drawling voice spoke from an inner room: [...] "'E's a bit upset. That's what 'e is! I remember when I was at Gworlior"--the rest of the story was lost, and the Englishman set to work to discover the nakedness of the dak-bungalow. For reasons which do not concern the public, it is made as bitterly uncomfortable as possible. The food is infamous, and the charges seem to be wilfully pitched about eighty per cent above the tariff, so that some portion of the bill, at least, may be paid without bloodshed, or the unseemly defilement of walls with the contents of <b>drinking</b> <b>glasses.</b> This is short-sighted policy, and it would, perhaps, be better to lower the prices and hide the tariff, and put a guard about the house to prevent jackal-molested donkeys from stampeding into the verandahs. But these be details. Jodhpur dak-bungalow is a merry, merry place, and any writer in search of new ground to locate a madly improbable story in, could not do better than study it diligently. In front lies sand, riddled with innumerable ant-holes, and beyond the sand the red sandstone wall of the city, and the Mahometan burying-ground that fringes it. Fragments of sandstone set on end mark the resting places of the Faithful, who are of no great account here. Above everything, a mark for miles around, towers the dun-red pile of the Fort which is also a Palace. This is set upon sandstone rock whose sharper features have been worn smooth by the wash of the windblown sand. It is as monstrous as anything in Dore's illustrations of the Contes Drolatiques and, wherever it wanders, the eye comes back at last to its fantastic bulk. There is no greenery on the rock, nothing but fierce sunlight or black shadow. A line of red hills forms the background of the city, and this is as bare as the picked bones of camels that lie bleaching on the sand below.|$|E
