5|$|There is a {{small power}} station {{comprising}} three Cummins B and C series diesel engines, offering an approx 150 kVa 3 phase supply {{to most of the}} island buildings. Waste heat <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> jackets is used for a district heating pipe. There are also plans to collect the waste heat <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> exhaust heat gases to feed into the district heat network to improve the efficiency further. The Power is normally switched off between 0000 and 0630.|$|E
5|$|By 2012 {{the latest}} version had seen many {{improvements}} to the design, the engine and the overall driving experience. It now had 517 PS and 620 Nm of torque <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> and came with carbon ceramic brakes as standard.|$|E
5|$|Ethylene bromide was an {{additive}} in gasolines {{containing lead}} anti-engine knocking agents. It scavenges lead by forming volatile lead bromide, which is exhausted <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> This application accounted for 77% of the bromine use in 1966 in the US. This application has declined since the 1970s due to environmental regulations (see below).|$|E

5|$|Before take-off, D'Mario placed three cloth-covered foam {{cushions}} {{on top of}} {{a heating}} vent under the instructor navigator's seat in the aft section of the lower deck. Shortly after take-off, another cushion was placed under the seat. The flight was uneventful until the scheduled mid-air refueling from a KC-135 Stratotanker, which had to be conducted manually because of an error with the B-52G's autopilot. About one hour after refueling, while the aircraft was circling above its designated area, Captain Haug directed co-pilot Svitenko to take his rest period. His seat was taken by the spare pilot, D'Mario. The crew was uncomfortable because of the cold, although the heater's rheostat was turned up, so D'Mario opened an engine bleed valve to draw additional hot air into the heater <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> manifold. Because of a heater malfunction, the air barely cooled as it traveled <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> manifold to the cabin's heating ducts. During the next half-hour, the cabin's temperature became uncomfortably hot, and the stowed cushions ignited. After one crew member reported smelling burning rubber, they looked for a fire. The navigator searched the lower compartment twice before discovering the fire behind a metal box. He attempted to fight it with two fire extinguishers, but could not put it out.|$|E
5|$|In September 1937 the Spitfire prototype, K5054, {{was fitted}} with ejector type exhausts. Later {{marks of the}} Spitfire used a {{variation}} of this exhaust system fitted with forward-facing intake ducts to distribute hot air out to the wing-mounted guns to prevent freezing and stoppages at high altitudes, replacing an earlier system that used heated air <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> coolant radiator. The latter system had become ineffective due to improvements to the Merlin itself which allowed higher operating altitudes where air temperatures are lower. Ejector exhausts were also fitted to other Merlin-powered aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Kulwicki {{died in an}} {{airplane}} crash on Thursday April 1, 1993. He was returning from an appearance at the Knoxville Hooters in a Hooters corporate plane on a short flight across Tennessee before the Sunday spring race at Bristol. The plane slowed and crashed just before final approach at Tri-Cities Regional Airport near Blountville. The National Transportation Safety Board attributed the crash to the pilot's failure to use the airplane's anti-ice system to clear ice <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> inlet system.|$|E

50|$|A {{long-term}} {{agreement between}} Detroit Edison and Wayne allows landfill gas from Woodland Meadows Landfill to be collected, compressed, and sent through underground piping to the plant. The boilers burn {{a combination of}} natural gas and landfill gas to create steam {{for use in the}} plant., The landfill gas also powers three engine generators, which produce approximately 2.4 megawatts of electricity. The electricity is sent to Detroit Edison's grid system using a step-up transformer. Flaring of the landfill gas is minimized in turn reducing emissions <b>from</b> <b>the</b> landfill. Exhaust <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> is recycled via ducts to the boilers' fireboxes; the combustion in the boilers acts as a re-burn cycle to further reduce <b>the</b> emissions <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines.</b> <b>The</b> 2 MMBTU per hour of recovered heat <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> means less gas in the boilers, reducing energy consumption and emissions. The partnership of Ford and Detroit Edison gives the utility company an electricity source from garbage that displaces coal-fired power.|$|R
5|$|Another theory {{presented}} by an expert {{shortly after the}} crash theorized that an engine fire {{could have been the}} catalyst of the accident. Under this theory, one of the two engines on the right wing may have caught fire. Shrapnel <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> may have punctured the fuselage, causing explosive decompression. Alternatively, Julian Frank, who was known to be desperately afraid of flying, may have panicked and hit the window, weakening it such that it subsequently blew out. Under this theory, the pilots and passengers would have been aware of an emergency aboard, which would have allowed them to begin making preparations for an emergency landing. This theory was supported by the wide right turn that the aircraft appeared to make prior to disintegrating and crashing, as well as {{the fact that some of}} the passengers were found wearing life jackets.|$|E
5|$|During {{preparations}} for the , Ron Dennis, the McLaren CEO and Chairman, noted that the team was encouraged by the aerodynamic data they had collected on the chassis, particularly its mid-corner speeds which he claimed {{were similar to those}} produced by other teams. He further added that the car's performance issues could be traced back to a lack of outright power and poor fuel efficiency <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> Éric Boullier, the team principal, further suggested that the main problem that the team faced was improving the efficiency of the RA615H's energy recovery systems, both in harvesting and deploying the additional power, and that by developing these areas, the car could make up several seconds on lap time, enough for the car to compete regularly for podium finishes.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of the cemetery's operation, the {{locomotives}} hauling the funeral trains from Waterloo would not travel down the branch into the cemetery, as it would leave the engine at the wrong end of the train for the return journey. Instead, the train would stop immediately after passing Necropolis Junction, and the carriages would be uncoupled <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> A team of black horses would then haul the carriages down the sloping branch line to the two cemetery stations. While the train was on the branch line the engine would be repositioned so as to be at the front of the train once the horses drew it back out of the branch and onto the main line.|$|E
2500|$|Even {{though the}} {{temperature}} was freezing and it was snowing, the crew did not activate <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> anti-ice system. This system uses heat <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> to prevent sensors from freezing, ensuring accurate readings.|$|R
50|$|Two tall smoke stacks towered {{above the}} forward {{part of the}} {{hurricane}} deck and the 'scape pipes were in the rear, venting steam <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R
50|$|An engine {{dynamometer}} measures {{power and}} torque directly <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine's</b> crankshaft (or flywheel), when <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> is removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> vehicle. These dynos do not account for power losses in the drivetrain, such as the gearbox, transmission, and differential.|$|R
5|$|On 21 November, {{reinforcements}} {{had reached}} {{them and the}} decision was made to move the commandos to La Calle by rail. With only intermittent air cover, the train was attacked by German fighters and No. 6 Commando suffered heavy casualties with 11 killed and 32 wounded. After the train driver jumped <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> one of the commandos took over the duties of driving the train. The unit remained in La Calle until 26 November, during which time the commandos were used to unload stores from the ships in the port, while half the unit carried out a reconnaissance patrol near Tabarka, to determine whether the German tanks that were parked there were real or decoys.|$|E
5|$|The prototypes {{performed}} well; however, several design failings led to {{the loss}} of WB771 on 14 July 1954, when the tailplane detached whilst making a low-level pass over the runway at Cranfield, causing the aircraft to crash with the loss of the crew. Attached to the fin using three bolts, the tailplane was subject to considerably more stress than had been anticipated, and the three bolts failed due to metal fatigue. Additionally, the prototypes were considerably tail heavy {{due to the lack of}} equipment in the nose; this was remedied by large ballast weights being fitted upon the prototypes. Production Victors had a lengthened nose that also served to move the crew escape door further <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> intakes. The fin was shortened to eliminate the potential for flutter while the tailplane attachment was changed to a stronger four-bolt fixing.|$|E
5|$|The {{victims were}} gassed with diesel exhaust <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> of a Red Army tank. SS-Scharführer Erich Fuchs was {{responsible}} for installing it. The engine was brought in by the SS {{at the time of}} the camp's construction and housed in a room with a generator that supplied the camp with electricity. The tank engine exhaust pipe ran just below the ground and opened into all three gas chambers. The fumes could be seen seeping out. After about 20 minutes the bodies were removed by dozens of Sonderkommandos, placed onto carts and wheeled away. The system was imperfect and required a lot of effort; trains that arrived later in the day had to wait on layover tracks overnight at Treblinka, Małkinia, or Wólka Okrąglik.|$|E
5000|$|The vehicle's {{construction}} differs <b>from</b> <b>the</b> traditional GEA's scheme {{which uses}} under-wing airflow <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> located in front. Designers of [...] "Burevestnik-24" [...] used a bi-plane scheme with <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> which {{are located on}} the top wing, facing rearwards with pushing propellers.|$|R
50|$|The first design had {{an engine}} that only {{vectored}} <b>the</b> thrust <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine's</b> fan (cool air) - {{this was only}} 50% of <b>the</b> <b>engine's</b> total thrust. Vectoring <b>from</b> <b>the</b> high-temperature <b>engine</b> exhaust was not originally contemplated, or thought possible. However he realised that the hot exhaust gases could be bifurcated, as demonstrated on the earlier Hawker Sea Hawk, to provide enough thrust for vertical take off, the fundamental layout of the Harrier.|$|R
50|$|On June 19, 1949, Valentiner died in Sønderborg {{hospital}} from lung disease, likely precipitated by the inhalation of toxic vapors <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> {{in his first}} U-boats, U-10 and U-3.|$|R
5|$|Now infected, Wesley uses {{a digital}} sample of Captain Picard's voice to lure key {{engineering}} crew-members {{away from the}} engineering deck. He erects a force field around the area with his tractor beam device and assumes control of the ship. He allows one of the engineers, Mr. Shimoda (Benjamin W.S. Lum), who is acting in a childlike manner, into the force field. Mr. Shimoda manages to remove all of the isolinear chips <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> control station and plays with them like toys. As the supergiant star collapses, a fragment is blown into a direct impact course with the two Federation ships, and without the chips in place, they cannot move out of its way. Chief Engineer Sarah MacDougal (Brooke Bundy) manages to disable Wesley's force field, and Data is sent to replace the chips. He reports {{that he will not}} have enough time. Wesley reverses the ship's tractor beam, repelling the Enterprise off the Tsiolkovsky, giving themselves the necessary additional seconds for Data to replace the chips enabling the ship {{to move out of the}} way. The crew is cured of the ailment, and Picard partially credits Wesley for helping to prevent a disaster.|$|E

5000|$|The CamPro IAFM was {{essentially}} a basic DOHC CamPro engine equipped with a variable length intake manifold (VIM). However, the VIM technology used in the CamPro IAFM differed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> one used in the superior CamPro CPS. Aside <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines,</b> <b>the</b> facelifted GEN•2 was also equipped with a new front bumper, grille, rear spoiler and alloy wheels.|$|R

25|$|Other {{events that}} can happen with jet engines, such as a fuel control fault, can result in excess fuel in <b>the</b> <b>engine’s</b> combustor.

25|$|In 2008, Nissan {{introduced}} the GT-R featuring a rear-mounted transaxle. The AWD system requires two drive shafts, one main shaft <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> to the transaxle and differential {{and a second}} drive shaft from the transaxle to the front wheels.|$|E
25|$|Gasolines {{are also}} treated with metal deactivators, which are {{compounds}} that sequester (deactivate) metal salts that otherwise accelerate {{the formation of}} gummy residues.

5|$|A {{number of}} {{residents}} on farming properties {{to the west}} of York heard a large aircraft flying low over the area.

Several residents reported seeing a bright flash of white light in the distance, followed by a loud crashing and scraping noise. Those closest to the crash could then see the yellow glow of a major fire.|$|R
