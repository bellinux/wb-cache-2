40|$|Leakage of {{compressed}} hydrogen in fueling stations {{can result from}} accidental rupture in the storage tank, pressure relief valve, and defects in pipe <b>fitting</b> <b>and</b> related <b>accessories.</b> The released fuel can ignite to form a jet flame {{in the presence of}} an ignition source. An enclosure or barrier wall around the storage facilities can limit the impact of hydrogen leakage on surrounding, personnel and equipments. In this study, the flow structure for different fuel jet-barrier wall configurations is visualized in a laboratory environment using high speed rainbow schlieren deflectometry. Hydrogen leakage is simulated by helium exiting at supersonic conditions. Transient fuel accumulation leading to steady state flow structure are investigated by varying the distance between leakage point (or jet exit) and barrier wall, height of the leakage point, and inclination of the barrier wall. Results include instantaneous rainbow schlieren images to depict the evolving flow structure, and contour plots of the mean and root-mean-square (RMS) deflection angles to quantify jet-wall interactions and mixing processes.

60|$|The painting--one might almost say panorama--was {{designed}} to portray a typical Western scene, interest {{culminating in a}} central animal figure, that of a stampeding steer, life-size, wild-eyed, fiery, breaking away in a mad rush from the herd that, close-ridden by a typical cowpuncher, occupied a position somewhat in the right background of the picture.

A Spanish dagger-plant, with its waxen blossoms in a creamy aggregation {{as large as a}} water-bucket, contributed floral beauty and variety. The distance was undulating prairie, bisected by stretches of the intermittent streams peculiar to the region lined with the rich green of live-oak and water-elm. A richly mottled rattlesnake lay coiled beneath a pale green clump of prickly pear in the foreground. A third of the canvas was ultramarine and lake white--the typical Western sky and the flying clouds, rainless and feathery.|$|R
5000|$|The classic Swiss Army Bicycle, as {{used by the}} Swiss Bicycle Infantry. Officially called Ordonnanzfahrrad Modell 05, it was {{introduced}} in 1905 and in continuous use until replaced by the MO-93. It was built between 1905 and 1989 by Schwalbe, Cäsar, Cosmos and Condor. Swiss bicycle Infantry were phased out in 2001. The most recognisable feature of most Swiss Army Bicycles is the large carry case fitted into the frame. It is accessed from the right-hand side, whilst having a separate document and map compartment on the left-hand side. They were painted all-over basic black, usually semi-matt, although some later models were painted olive drab. <b>Fittings</b> <b>and</b> <b>accessories</b> were variously black, brown or olive drab in colour. The basic model saw many variations as it was adapted for use in many different fields of warfare. Some were stripped down of all non-essential fittings {{for use as a}} messenger transport. Fitted with a 57 cm one-size-fits-all frame for men between 1.55m and 1.95m tall, they had 650B (26" [...] x 1-1/2") wheels. They were typically fitted with a 20-tooth rear sprocket, and a 50-tooth chainring giving an overall gearing of 65 gear inches. Two-wheel trailers were used for carrying cargo or a stretcher.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Waterworks <b>fittings</b> <b>and</b> <b>accessories</b> are {{important}} applications for ductile irons. Although, {{in the design}} of these components the graphite nodularity is a critical attribute for material selection, the International Standard ISO 2531 does not include the minimum required value of graphite nodularity and its definite effect on mechanical properties. In this research the effect of graphite nodularity on tensile strength, elongation, impact strength and wear rate was studies. Different samples from four heats of cast iron containing several of graphite nodularities were cast. Different degrees of graphite nodularities from low graphite nodularity of about 21 % up to high graphite nodularity of 94 % were produced by treatment cast iron by different amount of spheroidizing (Mg) and antispheroidizing (Ti) elements. It is concluded that all properties relating to strength and ductility decrease as the graphite nodularity increase, and those properties relating to failure, such as tensile strength and impact strength are more affected by changing of graphite nodularity. The minimum graphite nodularity of 60 % can be considered for design as satisfactory values of ductile iron <b>fittings</b> <b>and</b> <b>accessories</b> for all DN values.

40|$|Abstract—Corrosion of {{metallic}} water pipelines buried {{below ground}} surface {{is a function}} of the nature of the surrounding soil and groundwater. This gives the importance of knowing the physical and chemical characteristics of the pipe’s surrounding environment. The corrosion of externally – unprotected metallic water pipelines, specially ductile iron pipes, in localities with aggressive soil conditions is becoming a significant problem. Anticorrosive protection for metallic water pipelines, their <b>fittings</b> <b>and</b> <b>accessories</b> is very important, because they may be attached by corrosion with time. The tendency of a metallic substrate to corrode {{is a function of}} the surface characteristics of the metal and of the metal/protective film interface, the physical, electrical and electrochemical properties of the film, and the nature of the environment in which the pipelines system is placed. In this work the authors have looked at corrosion problems of water pipelines and their control. The corrosive properties of groundwater and soil environments are reviewed, and parameters affecting corrosion are discussed. The purpose of this work is to provide guidelines for materials selection in water and soil environments, and how the water pipelines can be protected against metallic corrosion...|$|E

40|$|Power {{transmission}} line is an interconnection from generating stations, may it be thermal or hydro, to load centers catering for industrial, commercial and domestic consumers of electricity. It comprises {{of a combination}} of components in a multi-discipline blend of electrical, structural and geotechnical engineering. The construction of power {{transmission line}}s has always been a challenge to the power industry utilities as it involves positioning and installation of tall towers on rugged terrains, inaccessibility of land transportations in remote areas, minimizing damages to crops and paddy fields, scarcity of rentice in urban developed areas, right-of-way (wayleave) management, sensitivities of land-use, constraints pertaining to the electricity supply regulation requirements, aesthetics and environmental considerations. Managing transmission line construction logistics is a specialized craft by itself. Heavy masses of structural steelwork, construction materials for concrete foundations, reels of conductor cables, transmission line <b>fittings</b> <b>and</b> <b>accessories,</b> and heavy stringing machineries such as tensioners and pullers need to be transported to hilltops or swampy areas. This paper provides an informative overview of the current construction practices and the management of logistics for the installation of power transmission lines in this region, the challenges facing the utilities and regulators for a sustainable construction, and the sharing of knowledge, technical information and experience on a specialized field of engineering construction...|$|E

40|$|Alloy {{wheels are}} {{automobile}} wheels {{which are made}} from an alloy of aluminum or magnesium metals Or sometimes a mixture of both. Alloy wheels differ from normal steel wheels because of their lighter weight, which improves the steering and {{the speed of the}} car.

The benefit of reduced unstrung weight is more precise steering as well as a nominal reduction in fuel consumption. Alloy is an excellent conductor of heat, improving heat dissipation from the brakes, reducing the risk of brake failure under demanding driving conditions. At present four wheeler wheels are made of Aluminum Alloys. In this project, Aluminum alloy are comparing with other Alloy. In this project a parametric model is designed for Alloy wheel used in four wheeler by collecting data from reverse engineering process from existing model.
