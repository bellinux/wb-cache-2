50|$|The <b>Greek</b> <b>rock</b> <b>lizard</b> (Lacerta graeca) is {{a species}} of lizard in the family Lacertidae. Endemic to Greece, its natural {{habitats}} are temperate forests, Mediterranean-type shrubby vegetation, rocky areas, and pastureland. It is threatened by habitat loss.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Greek</b> <b>rock</b> <b>lizard</b> is {{endemic to}} {{southern}} Greece {{where it is}} found only in the Peloponnese region, at altitudes of up to 1600 m above sea level but usually within the range 300 to 700 m. It is typically found near streams and pools, in light woodland, {{at the edge of}} fields bordering woodland and in shady areas of rock or scree.|$|E
5000|$|The chief threats {{faced by}} the <b>Greek</b> <b>rock</b> <b>lizard</b> are fires and the {{planting}} of Eucalyptus trees {{in place of the}} natural vegetation of the region. Although the lizard is quite common in places, its total area of occupancy is only around 20000 km2 and as the amount of suitable habitat is reduced, its numbers are decreasing. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed it as being [...] "near threatened" [...] and bordering on [...] "vulnerable.|$|E
40|$|Interspecific {{competition}} {{can limit}} {{the distribution of}} species along altitudinal gradients. It {{has been suggested that}} Western European <b>rock</b> <b>lizards</b> (genus Iberolacerta) are restricted to mountains due to the expansion of wall lizards (Podarcis), but there is no experimental evidence to corroborate this hypothesis. This study examines if interference competition with Podarcis muralis is a plausible explanation for the alpine confinement of Iberian <b>rock</b> <b>lizards</b> Iberolacerta cyreni. In a first experiment, we used an enclosure with four types of microhabitats to investigate whether adult <b>rock</b> and/or wall <b>lizards</b> shifted microhabitat or refuge preferences {{in the presence of the}} other species, and to detect aggressive interactions between them. In a second experiment, we staged heterospecific encounters between naïve, laboratoryborn juveniles to identify behavioural differences and agonistic interactions. In the enclosure, neither <b>rock</b> nor wall <b>lizards</b> changed their microhabitat preferences in the presence of the other species. Nevertheless, <b>rock</b> <b>lizards</b> increased the diversity of microhabitats and nocturnal refuges used in the single species trials, which had twice the number of conspecifics. Aggressive interactions involved mainly large <b>rock</b> <b>lizard</b> males. Juveniles did not show any interspecific agonistic behaviour, but <b>rock</b> <b>lizards</b> spent more time basking and less time moving. Thus, we found no evidence of competition between both species in terms of habitat shifts or agonistic interactions, although intraspecific interactions seemed to explain the behaviour of adult <b>rock</b> <b>lizards.</b> We conclude that other factors are currently determining the alpine confinement of <b>rock</b> <b>lizards.</b> This paper is a contribution to the project CGL 2007 - 02744 /BOS, funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (MICINN).

50|$|The <b>Greek</b> <b>rock</b> <b>lizard</b> is an agile {{species and}} climbs on rocks, walls, {{parapets}} and tree trunks but avoids prolonged periods {{in the full}} sun. Although it is mainly a climber, it does sometimes forage on the ground. The female lays a single clutch of up to six eggs, in a crevice or concealed place, and the eggs take about six weeks to hatch. When the lizard gets angry, it will in some cases spit acid at other animals that annoy it.|$|E
50|$|The Peloponnese wall lizard largely {{replaces the}} <b>Greek</b> <b>rock</b> <b>lizard</b> in the Peloponnese region. It is an agile species and climbs on rocks, walls and tree trunks. It often perches in an {{elevated}} position {{and can make}} long jumps between rocks. It often forages on the ground. The males are territorial during the breeding season and are very aggressive at this time. Females usually lay two clutches of up to six eggs, in crevices or concealed places, and the eggs take about six weeks to hatch, the newly hatched juveniles being about 3.5 cm long.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Greek</b> <b>rock</b> <b>lizard</b> is a {{medium-sized}} species growing to a snout-to-vent length of about 8 cm with a tail {{at least twice}} as long as this. The body is somewhat flattened and the legs are relatively long and slender. The colour is usually a glossy greyish-brown but may be more yellowish-brown, sometimes with a faint reddish tinge. Males have irregular dark spots on the back and dark flanks with many small pale spots. Females have smaller heads, fewer dark spots on the back and the pale spots on the flanks are more diffuse. Sometimes there are one or two blue spots above the shoulder; in males, these may extend a short way along the flanks. The underparts are yellow or orange and are usually speckled with fine dark markings, especially on the throat.|$|E

40|$|Many animals produce {{elaborated}} sexual {{signals to}} attract mates, {{among them are}} common chemical sexual signals (pheromones) with an attracting function. Lizards produce chemical secretions for scent marking that may {{have a role in}} sexual selection. In the laboratory, female <b>rock</b> <b>lizards</b> (Iberolacerta cyreni) prefer the scent of males with more ergosterol in their femoral secretions. However, it is not known whether the scent-marks of male <b>rock</b> <b>lizards</b> may actually attract females to male territories in the field. In the field, we added ergosterol to rocks inside the territories of male lizards, and found that this manipulation resulted in increased relative densities of females in these territories. Furthermore, a higher number of females were observed associated to males in manipulated plots, which probably increased mating opportunities for males in these areas. These and previous laboratory results suggest that female <b>rock</b> <b>lizards</b> may select to settle in home ranges based on the characteristics of scent-marks from conspecific males. Therefore, male <b>rock</b> <b>lizards</b> might attract more females and obtain more matings by increasing the proportion of ergosterol when scent-marking their territories. However, previous studies suggest that the allocation of ergosterol to secretions may be costly and only high quality males could afford it, thus, allowing the evolution of scent-marks as an honest sexual display...|$|R
