40|$|Abstract:- To {{develop the}} {{multimedia}} <b>instructional</b> <b>material</b> for robotics education, this study tried {{to develop a}} multimedia <b>instructional</b> <b>material</b> for robotics education and applied to a course {{to figure out the}} usability and utility. In this multimedia <b>instructional</b> <b>material,</b> there are four main sessions: adventure of the robot, assembly, programming, and demonstration video. The multimedia <b>instructional</b> <b>material</b> was designed to motivate students by an interesting adventure story, to introduce the assembly of a robot to complete the mission introduced in the adventure story, to introduce the programming of the operations of a robot to command the robot to complete the mission introduced in the adventure story, and to demonstrate the process of completing a mission. Finally, triangulation method was applied in this study to assess the user perception of the multimedia <b>instructional</b> <b>material</b> for robotics education. The triangulation data was obtained by observation, qualitative analysis of feedback generated by a class blog, and quantitative analysis of student perception of the multimedia <b>instructional</b> <b>material</b> for robotics education.

50|$|Interactions between {{levels of}} {{knowledge}} and the imagination effect: The imagination effect occurs when imagining the <b>instructional</b> <b>material</b> {{is more effective than}} studying the <b>instructional</b> <b>material.</b> The idea is that imagining the material supports the generation and construction of mental representations. Generally, low-knowledge learners benefit more from studying <b>instructional</b> <b>material</b> than from imagining it.

25|$|Romanization is not {{normally}} taught in Taiwan's public schools at any level. Consequently, most Taiwanese {{do not know}} how to romanize their names or addresses. Teachers use only Zhuyin ("bopomofo") for teaching and annotating the pronunciation of Mandarin. There have been sporadic discussions about using a romanization system during early education to teach children Mandarin pronunciation (like how students in Mainland China learn Mandarin using Hanyu Pinyin). However, like all other aspects of romanization in Taiwan, this is a controversial issue. The plan in the early 2000s to adopt Pinyin was delayed due to disagreements over which form to use (Tongyong or Hanyu).
