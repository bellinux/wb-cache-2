5|$|The British rock {{movement}} {{known as}} {{the new wave of}} British heavy metal (frequently abbreviated in NWOBHM), which started in the late 1970s and broke in the mainstream in the early 1980s, was just exploding in the United Kingdom and the band gained the support of a strong label at <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> time to exploit the moment and form a solid fan base.|$|E
5|$|Bewick {{made use}} of his close {{observation}} of nature, his remarkable visual memory, and his sharp eyesight to create accurate and extremely small details in his wood engravings, which proved to be both a strength and a weakness. If properly printed and closely examined, his prints could be seen to convey subtle clues {{to the character of}} his natural subjects, with humour and feeling. This was achieved by carefully varying the depth of the engraved grooves to provide actual greys, not only black and white, as well as the pattern of the marks to provide texture. But this subtlety of engraving created a serious technical difficulty for his printers; they needed to ink his blocks with {{just the right amount of}} ink, mixed so as to be of <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> thickness, and to press the block to the paper slowly and carefully, to obtain a result that would satisfy Bewick. Not surprisingly, this made printing slow and expensive. It also created a problem for Bewick's readers; if they lacked his excellent eyesight, they needed a magnifying glass to study his prints, especially the miniature tail-pieces. But the effect was transformative, and wood engraving became the main method of illustrating books for a century. The quality of Bewick's engravings attracted a far wider readership to his books than he had expected: his Fables and Quadrupeds were at the outset intended for children.|$|E
25|$|The Draught of Peace {{provides}} personal comfort, calms {{anxiety and}} soothes agitation. In Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Snape sets the potion {{as one of}} his lessons. It is a very difficult potion to make as the ingredients have to be added in a very specific order, the mixture has to be stirred <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> number of times and the heat of the flames on which it is simmering has to be lowered to <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> level for the right number of minutes before the final ingredient is added. Hannah Abbott had to have this potion in Order of the Phoenix to reduce her anxiety over the upcoming Ordinary Wizarding Levels (O.W.L.s).|$|E

25|$|Spark {{ignition}} {{engines are}} designed to burn gasoline in a controlled process called deflagration. However, the unburned mixture may autoignite by detonating from pressure and heat alone, rather than ignite from the spark plug at <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> time. This causes a rapid pressure rise which can damage the engine. This {{is often referred to}} as engine knocking or end-gas knock. Knocking can be reduced by increasing the gasoline's resistance to autoignition, which is expressed by its octane rating.|$|E

25|$|The CMB {{essentially}} {{confirms the}} Big Bang theory.

They were slightly off with their estimate, but they had <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> idea. They predicted the CMB.

25|$|But {{with these}} {{potential}} hazards, Clayton and Bell consistently turned out windows {{in which the}} balance of colour is eminently satisfying to the eye. They had the happy knack of selecting <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> tonal values so that difficult colour combinations, (such as red and green laid side by side as the cloth and lining of a cloak) appear inevitable. Moreover, their colour choices are rarely timid. (A “safe” choice is to line every cloak with yellow {{in the form of}} an applied silver-stain.) Although most of the colours in their windows are primaries- basic red, yellow and blue with a mid-tone grassy green, they introduced judiciously placed tertiary colours such as russet, brownish purple and a sort of mustard colour. The mustard colour often appears in conjunction with a bright intense blue. They frequently clothed a central figure in a robe of this bright blue, in contrast to the dark blue of the background and the bright red of surrounding robes.|$|E

500|$|The protein {{products}} of the regulatory toolkit are reused not by duplication and modification, but by a complex mosaic of pleiotropy, being applied unchanged in many independent developmental processes, giving pattern to many dissimilar body structures. The loci of these pleiotropic toolkit genes have large, complicated and modular cis-regulatory elements. For example, while a non-pleiotropic rhodopsin gene in the fruit fly has a cis-regulatory element {{just a few hundred}} base pairs long, the pleiotropic eyeless cis-regulatory region contains 6 cis-regulatory elements in over 7000 base pairs. The regulatory networks involved are often very large. Each regulatory protein controls [...] "scores to hundreds" [...] of cis-regulatory elements. For instance, 67 fruit fly transcription factors controlled on average 124 target genes each. All this complexity enables genes involved {{in the development of the}} embryo to be switched on and off at <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> times and in <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> places. Some of these genes are structural, directly forming enzymes, tissues and organs of the embryo. But many others are themselves regulatory genes, so what is switched on is often a precisely-timed cascade of switching, involving turning on one developmental process after another in the developing embryo.|$|E

500|$|The venture did {{not lose}} money, nor did it make much, and in July 1938 Gielgud turned to more {{conventional}} West End enterprises, in unconventional circumstances.

In September {{of the same year}} Gielgud appeared in Dodie Smith's sentimental comedy Dear Octopus. The following year he directed and appeared in The Importance of Being Earnest at the Queen's, with Evans playing Lady Bracknell for the first time.

500|$|In 1939–1940, {{the ship}} {{continued}} in her prewar role, {{although she was}} briefly considered for rearming in May 1940 as an anti-aircraft cruiser {{in support of the}} Norway campaign. She then served as a repair ship at Devonport before being converted into a blockship in April 1941. On 14 April, Winston Churchill suggested that a heavy naval bombardment of the Libyan city of Tripoli should be made by the Mediterranean Fleet and followed up by blocking the port with a battleship and the Admiralty suggested [...] and a cruiser, but Admiral Andrew Cunningham, commander of the Mediterranean Fleet, rejected the idea of using one of his active battleships and suggested Centurion instead. Upon further consideration, he assessed the chance of success as one in ten due the difficulties of [...] "wedging herself in <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> position within point blank range of the enemy guns with enemy dive bombers overhead."

500|$|Frank Scheck, {{writing in}} The Hollywood Reporter, said the film {{presented}} an enthralling story that [...] "resembles a taut... political thriller", and Roger Ebert in the Chicago Sun-Times {{called it a}} [...] "remarkable documentary" [...] full of [...] "astonishing shots". Both critics said the film was made so through the filmmakers' unique inside access to the events at the palace with Ebert calling that aspect [...] "unique in film history". Although Ebert was generally very praising of the film, he criticised {{the way in which}} Chávez's opponents were portrayed, while Shenk faulted the lack of historical context; however, he said this was balanced by the film's [...] "brevity and succinctness". In Variety, Scott Foundas wrote that the film was a [...] "superior example of fearless filmmakers in <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> place at the right time", and likely the best of a string of documentaries that have shone the light on US involvement in South America.

500|$|Her {{music videos}} {{contributed to a}} higher degree of sexual freedom among young women, as Jean M. Twenge, author of Generation Me: Why Today's Young Americans are More Confident, Assertive, Entitled—and More Miserable Than Ever Before (2007) wrote: [...] "In Alfred Kinsey's studies in the 1950s, only 3% of the young women had {{received}} oral sex from a man. By the mid-1990s, however, 75% of women aged 18-24 had experienced cunnilingus. Music videos by female artists have contributed to the trend, with both Mary J. Blige and Janet Jackson heavily implying male-on-female oral sex in music videos by pushing down on a man's head until he's in <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> position." [...] Similarly, Paula Kamen in Her Way: Young Women Remake the Sexual Revolution (2000) states that [...] "n the early to mid-1990s, oral sex even reached mainstream music as politically charged demand of truly liberated women," [...] citing TLC, Mary J. Blige and Janet Jackson as examples of female artists simulating cunnilingus in their videos. Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "she celebrated becoming an erotic being... young women a way to have their sexual freedom and their dignity, to have their cake and eat it too." [...] She was named Best Female Singer and Female Sex Symbol by Rolling Stone for the year 1993 in pop music. Goren adds that later pop stars such as Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Pink would rely on image, sex appeal and choreography as much as musical talent.|$|E
500|$|EastEnders has {{received}} {{praise for the}} handling of Peggy's breast cancer storyline, as she was a rare media portrayal of an older matriarchal woman with the disease. Older women are at higher risk of being diagnosed; however, in 2001, {{it was reported that}} media representation of breast cancer is skewed towards younger women in their 20s or 30s, as they are seen as [...] "more tragic" [...] or [...] "more sexy" [...] in media terms. A 2000 study by Kitzinger and Henderson showed that 94% of newspaper coverage on non-celebrity women with breast cancer was on those aged under 50. Source organisations working with EastEnders on the storyline have commented: [...] " [...] decided {{it was going to be}} [...] and very rightly so. Bang on, the right age [...] perfect dramatic licence in terms of her sons that she was going to have to share this terrible news with, and how would she share it? Every female would have that problem. How would you tell your children? And they followed that with her. She was <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> person." [...] The storyline also received media criticism, for the use of a breast care nurse, who was used to counsel Peggy and translate medical terminology into lay terms for viewers; a character who could provide both a dramatic and educational purpose. However, not all oncology units in the UK offer breast care nurses, and the character presented [...] "particularly positive messages" [...] concerning patient choice and control over treatment options. Because of this, the UK press dubbed the storyline [...] "didactic". The storyline was also criticised because Peggy received her cancer test results after six days, which prompted cancer charities to warn that not all patients would receive the same treatment.|$|E
