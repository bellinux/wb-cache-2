2500|$|In {{the course}} of characterising Byron, Hazlitt <b>glances</b> <b>back</b> to Scott, subject of the {{preceding}} chapter, and forward to Wordsworth and Southey, each of whom secures his own essay later in The Spirit of the Age. Scott, {{the only one of}} these writers who rivals Byron in popularity, notes Hazlitt in a lengthy comparison, keeps his own character offstage in his works; he is content to present [...] "nature" [...] in all its variety. Scott [...] "takes in half the universe in feeling, character, description"; Byron, on the other hand, [...] "shuts himself up in the Bastile of his own ruling passions." ...|$|E
60|$|The puff did {{not last}} long, dying away to nothing in a few minutes, and then the lugger lay {{immovable}} again. The men whistled, stamped the deck impatiently, and cast anxious <b>glances</b> <b>back</b> at the cutter.|$|E
60|$|Henry made no reply, and plodded on alone, {{though often}} he cast anxious <b>glances</b> <b>back</b> into the grey {{solitude}} where his partner had disappeared. An hour later, {{taking advantage of}} the cut-offs around which the sled had to go, Bill arrived.|$|E
60|$|Bill quickened his pace. Mitchell <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> in more leisurely fashion.|$|R

60|$|Duane <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> up the road. His pursuers were {{entering}} the village.|$|R
60|$|The girl {{reached their}} side a moment later, {{but it was}} with {{difficulty}} that she tore the mad beast from its prey. Still growling and casting hungry <b>glances</b> <b>back</b> upon Jav, the banth at last permitted itself to be led away into the wood.|$|E
60|$|ZOE: Me. Mind your cornflowers. (She darts to {{the piano}} and bangs chords on it with crossed arms) The cat's ramble through the slag. (She <b>glances</b> <b>back)</b> Eh? Who's making love to my sweeties? (She darts back to the table) What's yours is mine and what's mine is my own.|$|E
60|$|Notwithstanding {{that both}} Clayton {{and his wife}} kept a sharp lookout they saw nothing of larger animals, though on two {{occasions}} they had seen their little simian neighbors come screaming and chattering from the near-by ridge, casting frightened <b>glances</b> <b>back</b> over their little shoulders, and evincing as plainly as though by speech that they were fleeing some terrible thing which lay concealed there.|$|E
60|$|He {{broke off}} {{for a moment and}} <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> toward the willows.|$|R

60|$|Meanwhile, {{one thing}} seems plain to us: when {{the author of}} Book IX. posted the guards under Thrasymedes, he was {{deliberately}} leading up to Book X.; while the casual remark in Book XIV. about the exchange of shields between father and son, Nestor and Thrasymedes, <b>glances</b> <b>back</b> at Book X. and possibly refers to some lost and more explicit statement.|$|E
60|$|One afternoon, while Clayton {{was working}} upon an {{addition}} to their cabin, for he contemplated building several more rooms, a number of their grotesque little friends came shrieking and scolding through the trees {{from the direction of}} the ridge. Ever as they fled they cast fearful <b>glances</b> <b>back</b> of them, and finally they stopped near Clayton jabbering excitedly to him as though to warn him of approaching danger.|$|E
6000|$|With a deft {{movement}} {{she draws}} SIR WILLIAM toward the [...] billiard-room, and <b>glances</b> <b>back</b> at BILL before going out, but he [...] {{has turned to}} the writing-table. When the door is closed, BILL [...] looks into the drawing-room, them opens the door under the [...] stairs; and backing away towards the writing-table, sits down [...] there, and takes up a pen. FREDA who has evidently been [...] waiting, comes in and stands by the table.|$|E
60|$|He <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> at the village, {{then turned}} right round and {{regarded}} it steadfastly.|$|R
60|$|He let {{the reins}} go, and <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> to {{discover}} the third rat in pursuit behind....|$|R
60|$|He {{turned again}} to his pocket-book, <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> through the pages, and again started his pencil.|$|R
60|$|The conservative, looking {{before and}} after, draws from each contemplation the matter for content. Out {{of the age}} of gas lamps he <b>glances</b> <b>back</b> slightingly at the mirk and glimmer in which his {{ancestors}} wandered; his heart waxes jocund at the contrast; nor do his lips refrain from a stave, in the highest style of poetry, lauding progress and the golden mean. When gas first spread along a city, mapping it forth about evenfall for the eye of observant birds, a new age had begun for sociality and corporate pleasure-seeking, and begun with proper circumstance, becoming its own birthright. The work of Prometheus had advanced by another stride. Mankind and its supper parties were no longer at the mercy of a few miles of sea-fog; sundown no longer emptied the promenade; and the day was lengthened out to every man's fancy. The city-folk had stars of their own; biddable, domesticated stars.|$|E
60|$|With a smile, Coventry obeyed her; for {{the picture}} was of two lovers, the young {{cavalier}} kneeling, with his arm around the waist of the girl, who tries to hide him with her little mantle, and presses his head to her bosom in an ecstasy of fear, as she <b>glances</b> <b>back</b> at the approaching pursuers. Jean hesitated an instant and shrank a little as his hand touched her; she blushed deeply, and her eyes fell before his. Then, as the bell rang, she threw herself into her part with sudden spirit. One arm half covered him with her cloak, the other pillowed {{his head on the}} muslin kerchief folded over her bosom, and she looked backward with such terror in her eyes that more than one chivalrous young spectator longed to hurry to the rescue. It lasted but a moment; yet in that moment Coventry experienced another new sensation. Many women had smiled on him, but he had remained heart-whole, cool, and careless, quite unconscious of the power which a woman possesses and knows how to use, for the weal or woe of man. Now, as he knelt there with a soft arm about him, a slender waist yielding to his touch, and a maiden heart throbbing against his cheek, {{for the first time in}} his life he felt the indescribable spell of womanhood, and looked the ardent lover to perfection. Just as his face assumed this new and most becoming aspect, the curtain dropped, and clamorous encores recalled him to the fact that Miss Muir was trying to escape from his hold, which had grown painful in its unconscious pressure. He sprang up, half bewildered, and looking as he had never looked before.|$|E
50|$|Young-min ran as {{he smiled}} at Inyo, who {{returned}} angry <b>glances</b> <b>back</b> at Young-min.|$|E

60|$|He <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> at the village, {{then turned}} right round and {{regarded}} it with folded arms.|$|R
60|$|She evidently {{wanted him}} to come, and Leland, who seemed to feel it, <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> irresolutely at the sloo.|$|R
50|$|A woman {{leaves her}} {{children}} {{for an evening}} {{to go to a}} nightclub. In a moment of indecision she <b>glances</b> <b>back,</b> slips and falls. Money, desire and dreams converge as she enters a surreal world of haunting colours and lyrical distortions.|$|E
5000|$|In 1893 {{he wrote}} a volume of autobiographical reminiscence called <b>Glances</b> <b>Back</b> through Seventy Years, a graphic picture of {{literary}} Bohemia in Paris and London between 1840 and 1870. He died on 1 January 1894 at [...] "Heatherlands", Tilford, near Farnham in Surrey.|$|E
50|$|Takeru <b>glances</b> <b>back</b> to {{the bridge}} and sees Minoru alone on the bridge, looking down to the gorge below, and realises Chieko has fallen from the bridge. The police locates Chieko's body in the gorge and arrests Minoru for murder. His father rejects the charge, insisting Minoru isn't the type to kill, but Takeru isn't so sure.|$|E
60|$|None of {{the others}} showed any astonishment, {{and the man who}} had asked the {{question}} <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> toward the engineer.|$|R
60|$|The long boy removed himself slowly, {{loath to}} leave. At {{the door he}} cast an affectionate <b>glance</b> <b>back</b> at the table.|$|R
60|$|At this {{question}} the aged colored man blinked {{his eyes and}} shifted uneasily. He <b>glanced</b> <b>back,</b> over his load of wood.|$|R
50|$|Both {{eventually}} {{move out}} of the condo. Gary begins taking {{a more active role in}} his tour guide business, while Brooke travels the world, eventually returning to Chicago. Some time later, they meet again by chance on the street as Gary is bringing home groceries and Brooke is on her way to a meeting. After some awkward but friendly catching up, they part ways but each <b>glances</b> <b>back</b> over their shoulder and they share a smile.|$|E
5000|$|The {{scene and}} album end with [...] "Timelessness". Edgecrusher {{walks away from}} the figure and as he <b>glances</b> <b>back,</b> {{it seems as though}} it he has been weeping. The Securitron forces capture Edgecrusher in the conclusion. This last song has a very melancholic feel to it. The lyrics are desperate; they are Edgecrusher's words (or {{probably}} thoughts) from the jail. We can feel his fear and despair: he lost his battle against machines and failed in saving mankind.|$|E
50|$|Cobb {{manages to}} escape with Jimmy but is soon confronted by an undead Big Ben who wants revenge on him; Ben was taken {{prisoner}} and tortured before dying, and he blames Cobb {{for failing to}} save him. Cobb confronts Ben, no longer afraid of his fears, and destroys him with explosives {{as he and his}} son escape the burning house. In the end, he triumphantly <b>glances</b> <b>back</b> at the house while regaining control of his life and reunites with his wife and child.|$|E

60|$|Dr. May looked piteously, despairingly, at Leonard; but {{the brow}} was still open and unclouded, the eye <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> {{reassurance}} and confidence.|$|R
