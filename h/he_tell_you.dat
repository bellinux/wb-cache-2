6000|$|... "Did <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> sir, on what ground these learned gentlemen {{had come}} to this decision?" [...] quietly asked Admiral Bluewater.|$|E
6000|$|... "Did <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> so?" [...] The {{question}} left Rowland's lips {{before he}} could stay it, which {{he would have done}} on a moment's reflection.|$|E
6000|$|... "He lunched with us one {{day when}} father had gout. Didn't <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> about it? He said {{he was coming to}} see you that afternoon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He will <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> if <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> what <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> me, that <b>you</b> are quieter and quicker of {{resource}} {{than any one}} he ever saw.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... #Subtitle level 3: Chapter 3. Donâ€™t Believe Anything <b>He</b> <b>Tells</b> <b>You</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You soon will. <b>You</b> see how <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> {{you are to}} be a comfort; {{and if you are}} a good boy, you'll quickly {{leave the}} dunce behind.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have as {{much chance}} of earning fifteen hundred a year, Regina, as I have of being made King of England. Did <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is not {{his health}} which frightens me. I am sure--I am quite sure that he has {{something}} upon his mind. Did <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> nothing?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What! did <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> of the imp {{behind the}} log {{and of the}} miserable devil who went over the fall--or of the wretch in the tree?" ...|$|E
50|$|Well, {{if you are}} a high-priced man, {{you will}} do exactly as this man <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> to-morrow, from morning till night. When <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> to pick up a pig and walk, you pick it up and you walk, and when <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> to sit down and rest, you sit down. You do that right {{straight}} through the day. And what's more, no back talk. Now a high-priced man does just what he's told to do, and no back talk. Do you understand that? When this man <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> to walk, <b>you</b> walk; when <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> to sit down, you sit down, and you don't talk back at him. Now you come on to work here to-morrow morning and I'll know before night whether you are really a high-priced man or not.|$|R
6000|$|... "Down there. I'm {{going to}} ask my father. I suppose you'll believe it if <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you.</b> I suppose you'll believe a Professor of Astronomy knows what--" ...|$|R
6000|$|And {{in another}} place, {{modestly}} excluding {{himself from the}} number of poets, because he only writ odes and satires, <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> a poet is such an one, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm so glad William is coming. Did <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{that he sent}} me his manuscript? I think it's wonderful--I think he's almost {{good enough}} for you, Katharine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{you knew}} he was going to the House, Giles?" [...] she said, turning her large tender eyes anxiously upon him. [...] "Did <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what for?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Catherine {{listened to}} this {{with her eyes}} fixed upon her aunt, and {{continued}} to gaze at her for some time afterwards. [...] "Did <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> to say that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Simply do what <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you,</b> {{whether it}} is wrong or right. If it's right, {{it ought to be}} done, and if it's wrong, it will not be your fault." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are a {{remarkable}} girl, Cynthia," [...] said Miss Lucretia, involuntarily. Then {{she paused for}} a moment. [...] "Suppose <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> they are true? You surely can't live with him again, Cynthia." ...|$|R
60|$|Warn. Of {{more than}} their flattery can make good, sir; 'tis true <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you,</b> they have flattered him; but, in my conscience, {{he is the most}} down-right simple-natured {{creature}} in the world.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course! Didn't <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you?</b> Well, {{perhaps he}} would be afraid of its {{worrying}} you. It would be like Charley Leland, and here I have been giving him away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{if he saw}} them, why didn't <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> Whitney?" [...] Mr. Blount said. [...] "Tired as our horses were, {{they could}} have got up a gallop for a bit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, he did," [...] said Mrs. Hasketh, in a crest-fallen sort, [...] "But we thought--we thought--you {{might know}} where he was. And Fay--Did <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{what he was going}} to do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Has {{your son}} {{been talking to}} you about--about what was said between him and me the other day? I am sure he has, for I know <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> everything,--as <b>he</b> ought to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{will marry}} on {{anything}} or nothing. And if {{you speak to}} him <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> of how the young ravens were fed. But he always forgets that he's not a young raven himself." ...|$|R
5000|$|A simpler {{solution}} is to ask either man if they themselves would <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that their path leads to freedom. For example, in the case where the knight's door in fact leads to freedom, the knight would answer [...] "yes" [...] (as <b>he</b> would <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that his own path led to freedom) and the knave [...] "no" [...] (although <b>he</b> would also <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that his own path led to freedom, he would lie about whether <b>he</b> would <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> this).|$|R
6000|$|Young Wharton {{tapped his}} sister on the cheek, with a smile, as he asked her, in an {{affected}} whisper, [...] "Did <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> also {{that he loved}} my little sister Fanny?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Did <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> how I pressed him?' There was no {{red tide}} this time, nor ever again whilst the {{interview}} lasted. To bow in affirmation was insufficient; {{with an effort}} he answered: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{what did}} <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> dear?" [...] Mrs. Gildersleeve asked, with that frightened air, as of a startled wild thing, growing deeper than ever upon her countenance as she uttered the question.|$|E
60|$|This, Giotto <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> {{to believe}} as the {{beginning}} of all knowledge and all power. [Footnote: So also the Master-builder of the Ducal Palace of Venice. See Fors Clavigera for June of this year.] This <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> to believe, as a thing which he himself knows.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> that [...] "the {{topic of}} {{instructions}} has occasioned much altercation and uneasiness in this city"; and he expresses himself (if I understand him rightly) {{in favor of}} the coercive authority of such instructions.|$|R
50|$|The king {{herewith}} sends to you Hanni, {{the son of}} Maireya, {{the stable}} overseer of the king in Canaan. And what <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> heed very carefully lest the king find fault in you. Every word that <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> heed very carefully and carry out very carefully. And be on your guard! Be on your guard! Do not be negligent! And may you prepare {{before the arrival of}} the archers of the king - food in abundance, wine (and) everything else in abundance. Indeed he is going to reach you very quickly, (i.e. soon), and he will cut off the heads of the enemies of the king.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is it not plain now," [...] cried Lu-don, [...] "that this {{creature}} is no god. Did <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{that he was}} the son of god?" [...] he almost shouted, turning suddenly upon Pan-at-lee.|$|E
6000|$|... "Just {{as though}} it were a thing of course. But I noticed it. It was not when he bade me poke the fire, but the next time. Did <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> about the fire?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Strether {{took a turn}} {{before he}} answered. [...] "Hasn't he given you Jim? Hasn't he before this 'done' him for you?" [...] He was {{a little at a}} loss. [...] "Doesn't <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> things?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{no wish to}} do {{anything}} of the sort," [...] Lutchester assured her. [...] "Make a bargain with me. Mr. Haskall will be here soon. Unfasten the little package you are carrying somewhere about your person, hand him the envelope and watch his face. If <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> that what you have offered him is a coherent and possible formula for an explosive, then you can look upon me for ever afterwards as the poor, foolish person you sometimes seem to consider me. If, on the other hand, <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> that it is rubbish, I shall expect you at the Ritz-Carlton at half-past eight." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she nodded. [...] "That's {{just what}} he would call it. And {{whenever}} <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> you are standing on your foot watch out for him. Now I must go. Good bye, and thank you again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, indeed, Albinia,' {{answered}} her brother, seriously, 'I fully believe that Gilbert imagines all that <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you,</b> but you cannot suppose {{that either the}} tutor or doctor could fail {{to see if he}} were so very ill.' ...|$|R
