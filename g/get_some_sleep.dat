The ambulance doctor reported that the patient didn't mention previous illness history (namely his previous stroke), he only mentioned his diabetes and his knee pain that prevented him from sleep. Pascu refused hospitalization. His only request was to be administrated something in order to <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>sleep,</b> and the doctor gave him Diazepam. A second call followed {{a couple of hours}} later; this time Pascu was unconscious. Doctors tried to resuscitate, but to no avail. It was determined that Pascu died due to a heart attack.|$|E

As the telethon begins, Leslie is already exhausted and is falling asleep. With time to kill, Tom brings Detlef to the Snakehole Lounge, but the owner, Freddy (Andy Milder), refuses to let him go because Detlef is bringing a lot of business, delaying Leslie's big headliner. Andy's (Chris Pratt) band, Mouse Rat, is asked to replace Detlef, but when they complete all of their songs, Leslie has nothing else to put on the air. Ron (Nick Offerman) volunteers to demonstrate how to cane a chair, but his presentation is so boring that the telethon actually starts to lose money.|$|E

Over dinner, Chris once again acts so optimistic while {{discussing}} the break-up that Ann thinks their relationship is back on and tries to kiss him, severely embarrassing her. Meanwhile, the camping trip proves unsuccessful and everybody decides to go home that night, but they are left without transportation because Tom and Ben have hooked all of their electronics to the van's battery, draining it. Everybody hikes to a strange bed and breakfast filled with cats and dolls called The Quiet Corn, run by a strict old lady named Elsa Clack (Annie O'Donnell). Andy arrives and rebuilds the romantic tent in the yard for a flattered April. Leslie tells Ron about her mental block, worrying she will never again reproduce an idea better than harvest festival. Ron, recognizing how burnt out she is, solves Leslie's problem by locking her in a bedroom and ordering her to <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>sleep.</b> With a rare full night's sleep energizing her, Leslie wakes up with numerous big ideas that are well received by Chris.|$|E

25|$|Ingle was a well-liked captain, {{according}} to David Foot's history of Somerset cricket, and unlike some Somerset amateurs got on {{well with the}} limited numbers of professionals the county employed. The life of a Somerset captain in the inter-war years was rarely easy, because the county rarely had {{more than half a}} dozen professionals, and the team was perennially made up of an itinerant band of amateurs of variable talent. In one of Ingle's more successful seasons, 1936, Somerset played 34 different cricketers in the County Championship matches.

40|$|Numerous {{stressors}} {{affect the}} intensive care unit (ICU) patient. The ICU environment is busy and noisy, with monitoring and treatment around the clock. ICU patients may have problems in <b>getting</b> <b>some</b> <b>sleep,</b> due to lighting and noise. Many ICU survivors report having pain during their ICU stay. Stressful experiences from the ICU contribute to later development of posttraumatic stress symptoms. The comfort and well-being of ICU patients is today an important goal and methods and strategies to achieve this are developing. In this thesis, two areas related to ICU patient exposures were evaluated: noise and pain. A method of monitoring skin conductance variability (SCV) was evaluated. In Paper I, we compared sound pressure levels in three different ICU room types and three different shifts, as well as analysed the sources of disruptive sounds in the different room types. We found that sound pressure levels were similar in the different room types, with a trend towards lower night-time levels. Levels were well above international recommendations. Disruptive sounds were more frequent in three-bed rooms than in singlebed rooms. Main disruptive ICU sounds were from machine alarms and from noisy chatting. In Paper II, we studied SCV as a measure of pain in 40 ICU patients. Increasing levels of stimulation was associated with elevation of SCV. In non-intubated patients, there was an interaction effect between pain and agitation on SCV. In Paper III, we monitored 18 volunteers with SCV and exposed them to a standardised pain stimulus, to pictures with varying emotional content and to an ICU sound recording, in random combinations. SCV was significantly elevated by pain stimulation {{and to a lesser extent}} affected by emotion-inducing pictures or ICU sound. In Paper IV, 30 recently discharged ICU patients were monitored with SCV and exposed to the same ICU sound recording as in study III. During SCV monitoring, patients were also asked questions regarding traumatic experiences from the ICU. SCV was significantly elevated in most patients in response to both ICU sounds and questions. There was, however no correlation with stress symptoms assessed with a specific questionnaire for ICU survivors. In conclusion, the studies of this thesis show that a) sound levels preclude normal sleep and can potentially be modifying machine alarms and behaviour b) skin conductance variability may be difficult to interpret in awake patients but potentially has a room for monitoring pain in poorly communicable patients. Further studies in poorly communicable ICU patients during interventions may further elucidate the role of such monitorin...|$|R
40|$|Women face {{a myriad}} of ongoing and complex ethical {{dilemmas}} in caring for a frail elder (Bopp & Coleson, 1996). An ethical dilemma {{can be defined as}} a conflict in which the caregiver must make a choice “between two or more relevant, but contradictory ethical directives, or when every alternative results in an undesirable outcome for one or more persons ” (Loewenberg, Dolgoff & Harrington, 2000, p. 9). An example of an ethical dilemma highlights the complexity of decision making for caregivers. A spousal caregiver struggled to care for herself and also provide care for the frail elder. The frail elder was at risk for falling, had cognitive deficits and was getting out of bed at night to climb downstairs to a basement shop. The caregiver did not want to restrict the frail elder’s freedom, but after conversations with family, she decided to put a lock on their bedroom door to keep the frail elder from harming himself. The caregiver acted out of values of self-care and the care and safety of the frail elder. By putting the lock on the bedroom door, she was able to <b>get</b> <b>some</b> needed <b>sleep,</b> thereby taking care of herself {{and at the same time}} providing for the safety of the frail elder. Gerontological writers have described the importance of moral dialogue involving elders, caregivers and others for the purpose of addressing caregiving ethical dilemmas on such topics as health care treatment and home care options (Bopp & Coleson, 1996; Spano & Koenig, 2003). However, rarely have research efforts examined the way caregivers personally define and make decisions about ethical dilemmas. Hence, this dissertation focused on obtaining women’s perspectives about these ethical dilemmas...|$|R
