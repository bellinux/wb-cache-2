Based on collated stress-strain data on <b>ferritic</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steel,</b> key aspects of the material model given in Annex C of EN 1993 - 1 - 4 [1] were evaluated and found to require adjustment. Proposed modifications are presented herein.; The local buckling behaviour of <b>ferritic</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> sections in compression and bending was examined numerically, using the finite element (FE) package ABAQUS. The studied section types were cold-formed square hollow sections (SHS), rectangular hollow sections (RHS) and channels, as well as welded I-sections. The models were first validated against experimental data collected from the literature, after which parametric studies were performed to generate data over a wide range of section geometries and slendernesses. The obtained numerical results, together with existing experimental data from the literature were used to assess the applicability of the slenderness limits and effective width formulae set out in EN 1993 - 1 - 4 [1] to <b>ferritic</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> sections.; The comparisons of the generated FE results for <b>ferritic</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> with the design provisions of EN 1993 - 1 - 4 [1], highlighted, in line with other stainless steel grades, the inherent conservatism {{associated with the use of}} the 0. 2 % proof stress as the limiting design stress. To overcome this, the continuous strength method (CSM) was developed as an alternative design approach to exploit the deformation capacity and strain hardening potential of stocky cross-sections. An extension of the method to ferritic stainless steels, including the specification of a revised strain hardening slope for the CSM material model, is proposed herein. Comparisons with test and FE data showed that the CSM predictions are more accurate and consistent than existing provisions thus leading to significant material savings and hence more efficient structural design.
