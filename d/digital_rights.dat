Also, the iPad's development model requires anyone creating an app for the iPad {{to sign a}} non-disclosure agreement and pay for a developer subscription. Critics argue Apple's centralized app approval process {{and control of the}} platform itself could stifle software innovation.

40|$|The last decade, online {{activism}} has vastly grown. In {{the current}} digital society, {{from time to}} time citizens decide to express their opinion by attacking large corporations digitally in some way. Where the activists claim this to be a digital assembly, others see it as criminal offences. In this paper, we will explore the legal and technical borders of the <b>digital</b> <b>right</b> to assembly. By doing so, we can gain insight into digital manifestations and make up the balance on the <b>digital</b> <b>right</b> to assembly.

30|$|One popular {{technology}} for <b>digital</b> <b>right</b> protection is <b>digital</b> watermarking [1], where a specific signal (e.g., the ownership information) is embedded into the host media content without significantly degrading the perceptual {{quality of the}} original media data. In contrast to traditional encryption techniques, watermarked media data can still be used while remaining protected, and thus watermarking can provide post-delivery protection of digital media. It is worth mentioning that, despite the popularity of watermarking techniques, effective <b>digital</b> <b>right</b> protection is extremely challenging and currently there is no commonly accepted technical solution which is practically unbeatable when deployed to practical user settings. At any sense, watermarking techniques should only be considered as one important component of an overall protection system.|$|R

Its mission is to offer games free of <b>digital</b> <b>rights</b> management (DRM) to players and its service was expanded to cover new AAA and independent games. The company opposes DRM in video games, and hopes that free downloadable content becomes an industry standard. CD Projekt considers maintaining their independence {{one of their most}} important strategies.

5|$|Steam is {{a digital}} {{distribution}} platform developed by Valve Corporation, which offers <b>digital</b> <b>rights</b> management (DRM), multiplayer gaming, video streaming and social networking services. Steam provides the user with installation and automatic updating of games, and community {{features such as}} friends lists and groups, cloud saving, and in-game voice and chat functionality. The software provides a freely available application programming interface (API) called Steamworks, which developers can use to integrate many of Steam's functions into their products, including networking, matchmaking, in-game achievements, micro-transactions, and support for user-created content through Steam Workshop. Though initially developed for use on Microsoft Windows operating systems, versions for OS X and Linux were later released. Mobile apps with connected functionality with the main software were later released for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone devices in the 2010s.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, the {{information}} protection for digital contents becomes {{an important issue}} for enterprise applications. To protect digital contents, various enterprise <b>digital</b> <b>right</b> management (E-DRM) schemes have been proposed to prevent the digital contents from illegal accesses.

To overcome the above problems, we propose a new group-oriented E-DRM scheme with reliable and flexible access policies in this paper. The proposed scheme allows multiple users to acquire the access right, which can be dynamically determined according to the enterprise policy. In addition, no one can access the digital contents except authorized users. Compared with the related works, the proposed scheme is more reliable and flexible for enterprise applications...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, various {{enterprise}} <b>digital</b> <b>right</b> management (E-DRM) schemes {{have been}} proposed to protect and manage access <b>rights</b> of <b>digital</b> contents for the enterprise applications. However, {{we find that the}} previous E-DRM schemes do not protect the user privacy while mobile users access digital contents. In addition, the previous E-DRM schemes have high computation and communication loads. Besides, these schemes do not provide usage tracking for the digital content, and thus the <b>digital</b> <b>right</b> may be abused by malicious users. To solve the above problems, we propose a new E-DRM scheme with anonymous trust for mobile devices in this paper. The proposed scheme has low computation and communication loads, and it provides the user anonymity and usage tracking. Therefore, the proposed scheme is more efficient and practical than the related works for E-DRM applications. Povzetek: Razvita je nova shema E-DRM za določanje zaupanja v mobilnih napravah. ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Digital watermarks (DWM) {{refer to}} {{embedding}} additional information directly into audio signal for <b>digital</b> <b>right</b> management and automatic identification of radiotelephone transmissions in aeronautical, maritime and military VHF communication. The main part. The designed embedding algorithm {{is based on}} evaluation of sliding frame to embed information or no regarding to distortions introduced by DWM. Watermark location is grounded calculation of distances norm between received and maximum likelihood estimated signal vectors {{in the domain of}} Discreet Fourier Transform and doesn?t need for any marking and synchronizing measures. Robustness of DWM against quantization, filtering, additive Gaussian noise, digital format conversion is provided by multichannel narrowband DWM transmission and application of BCH (63, 30, 6) error-correction code. The proposed algorithm demonstrates watermark inaudibility because of preserving signal power before and after data embedding and searching the most suitable frames for DWM positioning. Conclusion. The proposed algorithms provide advanced compromising solution of audio watermarking process: data payload ? inaudibility ? robustness. The designed algorithms are applicable both in analog and digital channels for transmission monitoring and <b>digital</b> <b>right</b> management. ??????????? ????????? ??????????? ? ??????????? ???????? ??????? ?????? ? ???????? ??????? ?? ?????? ??????? ??????????? ?????? ? ????????? ???????. ????????? ???????????? ??????????? ????????? ???????, ??????????? ? ????????????? ??? ? ??????????? ?????? ??? ????????????? ?????-???? ???????? ? ??????????????. ??? ??????????? ?????????????????? ??? ????????? ???????????? ?????????????? ???????? ? ???????????????? ???????????...|$|R
