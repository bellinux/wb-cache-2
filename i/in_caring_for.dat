5|$|Measuring , {{the eggs}} are oval, smooth and lustreless white, with small spots or blotches of red on the larger end. The clutch size is {{reported}} to be two or three eggs. While there is no reliable information on incubation and feeding, it is believed that both parents are active <b>in</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> the young. A field study by Jan Lewis and colleagues found that only females bore brood patches, suggesting they alone incubated eggs.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the greater}} {{investment}} in raising the young and because foraging for food may occur far from the nest site, in all seabird species except the phalaropes, both parents participate <b>in</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> the young, and pairs are typically at least seasonally monogamous. Many species, such as gulls, auks and penguins, retain the same mate for several seasons, and many petrel species mate for life. Albatrosses and procellariids, which mate for life, take many years to form a pair bond before they breed, and the albatrosses have an elaborate breeding dance {{that is part of}} pair-bond formation.|$|E

5|$|Red foxes {{are usually}} {{together}} in pairs or small groups consisting of families, {{such as a}} mated pair and their young, or a male with several females having kinship ties. The young of the mated pair remain with their parents to assist <b>in</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> new kits. The species primarily feeds on small rodents, though it may also target rabbits, game birds, reptiles, invertebrates and young ungulates. Fruit and vegetable matter is also eaten sometimes. Although the red fox tends to kill smaller predators, including other fox species, it is vulnerable to attack from larger predators, such as wolves, coyotes, golden jackals and medium- and large-sized felines.|$|E
5|$|The 6th Massachusetts reached Washington D.C. on April 19, 1861, {{the first}} unit {{to arrive in}} {{response}} to Lincoln's call for troops. A large, cheering crowd welcomed them at the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Station which once stood north of the Capitol. Among the crowd was Clara Barton who became a famed nurse during the Civil War. At the time a clerk in the U.S. Patent Office, Barton gained her first experience <b>in</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> wounded soldiers as she tended to injured men of the 6th Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of wasp species are solitary insects. Having mated, the adult female forages alone and if it builds a nest, does so {{for the benefit of}} its own offspring. Some solitary wasps nest in small groups alongside others of their species, but each is involved <b>in</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> its own offspring (except for such actions as stealing other wasp's prey or laying in other wasp's nests). There are some species of solitary wasp that build communal nests, each insect having its own cell and providing food for its own offspring, but these wasps do not adopt the division of labour and the complex behavioural patterns adopted by eusocial species.|$|E

5|$|At the Magic Box, Giles {{recognizes that}} he must stand aside if Buffy is to face her {{responsibilities}} <b>in</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> Dawn instead of relying on him ("Standing") and Tara finds {{a picture of the}} forget-me-not flower Willow used to cast a spell on her in a book of magic. Giles and Tara separately resolve to leave the people they love, respectively Buffy and Willow — Giles wants to leave Buffy for her own good, while Tara wants to leave Willow because she has become horrified by Willow’s magical manipulation of their relationship ("Under Your Spell / Standing—Reprise"). Captured by Spike outside the store, one of Sweet’s minions conveys a challenge from Sweet for Buffy to rescue Dawn from The Bronze. Giles forbids the gang to assist Buffy, so she goes alone, despite having no will to do so; eventually Giles and the Scoobies change their minds and leave to catch up. Although Spike initially thinks that things would be better for him if Buffy was dead, he also changes his mind and decides to help Buffy; Sweet opines that Buffy is drawn to danger ("Walk Through the Fire").|$|E
5|$|Newborns {{have black}} natal coats and bright pink skin. Females {{are the primary}} {{caregivers}} of infants, but males also play a role. In its first few days, the infant {{may be unable to}} stay attached to its mother and relies on her for physical support. However, its grasp grows stronger by its first week and it is able to cling to its mother's fur by itself. By two weeks, the infant begins to explore its surroundings for short periods, but stays near her. The distance the infant spends away from its mother increases the older it gets. In general, higher-ranking females are usually more relaxed parents than females of lower rank, which usually keep their offspring close to them. However, this difference only lasts for approximately the first eight weeks of an infant's life. Olive baboons do not seem to practice co-operative parenting, but a female may groom an infant that is not hers. Subadult and juvenile females are more likely to care for another's young, as they have not yet produced offspring of their own. One theory for why immature females tend to seek out infants is that they can prepare for their future roles as mothers. Infant baboons born to first-time mothers suffer higher mortality than those born to experienced mothers, which suggests that prior experience <b>in</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> infants is important. Adult males in the groups also care for the infants, as {{they are likely to be}} related to them. Males groom infants, reducing the amount of parasites they may have, and calm them when they are stressed. They may also protect them from predators, such as chimpanzees. However, adult males exploit infants and use them to reduce the likelihood that other males will threaten them.|$|E

25|$|Some taxa {{with high}} social {{organization}} are eusocial, meaning {{that a single}} female (e.g., the queen bee) or caste produces offspring while the other organisms (e.g., worker bees) cooperate <b>in</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> the young.

25|$|The {{cooperative}} breeding hypothesis {{predicts that}} cotton-top tamarins engage with this young-rearing paradigm, {{and in turn}} naturally embrace patterns of prosocial behavior. These monkeys engage in such behavior by acting altruistically within their groups <b>in</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> infants, vocalizing alarm calls, and in sharing food. Though some studies indicate that cotton-top tamarins have the psychological capacity to participate in reciprocally mediated altruism, {{it is unclear whether}} the cotton-top tamarin acts solely using judgements on reinforcement history.|$|E

25|$|After {{his sister}} died in 1970, Ball came under strong {{criticism}} for reinvesting the trust's income {{to build up}} their value instead of fully respecting the requirements of du Pont's will, which stipulated that after Jessie Ball du Pont's death, trust income was {{to be used to}} aid the Nemours Foundation <b>in</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> the crippled children and indigent elderly of Delaware.
