Her topics are {{different}} depending on the genre she is writing in; her adult-oriented works often deal with minority groups, while her children's books are meant to teach empathy. Her children's works have won three Adhikarya Awards from the Indonesian Publishers Association, and LGBT groups have praised her novel Gerhana Kembar (Twin Eclipse; 2007) for avoiding stereotyping the group. However, some <b>educators</b> <b>have</b> protested {{the lack of an}} explicit moral message in her children's books.|$|E
25|$|There are no formalised rules {{regarding}} {{observation and}} monitoring, but many <b>educators</b> <b>have</b> {{an interest in}} working with interaction-based observation. It is common for an institution to hold parent consultations, where {{the staff of the}} institution discuss with individual children's parents how children thrive in the institution, what they occupy themselves with, their strong and weak points, and about their social relationship with other children.|$|E
25|$|<b>Educators</b> <b>have</b> {{argued for}} years about which method is best to teach reading to children. For the English language, {{there are two major}} methods, Phonics and Whole Language, within which there are subtypes Synthetic Phonics and Sight word respectively. Each method is {{employed}} at differing rates depending on the country and the specific school division. Some educators are beginning to use the two methods in conjunction to maximize the benefits of both methods.|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} {{develops}} and evaluates {{a tool to}} distinguish four different categories of educators for the effective delivery of HIV/AIDS health education using data from 548 randomly selected participants aged 16 years. The D 4 Diagnostic Quadrant is based on HIV knowledge and sexual practice behaviours and indicates four distinct typologies of educator. The discerning <b>educator</b> <b>has</b> high HIV/AIDS knowledge and healthy sexual practices. The dissolute <b>educator</b> <b>has</b> high HIV/AIDS knowledge but employs unhealthy or risky sexual practices. The decorous <b>educator</b> <b>has</b> low HIV/AIDS knowledge but practices healthy sexual practices. The disempowered <b>educator</b> <b>has</b> low HIV/AIDS knowledge and employs unhealthy or risky sexual practices. The {{study found that the}} two categories that will result in the most effective behaviour-change interventions are those that target ‘discerning’ and ‘decorous’ individuals as the educators. Both these categories have underlying healthy practices that minimise the risk of HIV transmission. The D 4 Diagnostic Quadrant tool provides information as to existing knowledge and beliefs about HIV/AIDS that can inform decisions relating to the allocation of scarce resources. The tool will be very useful in the selection process of would-be educators particularly in health-promotion interventions...|$|R
25|$|Stated differently, Is {{the goal}} of {{education}} to have children recreate the process of discovery, to learn the products of discovery, or some combination? Some <b>educators</b> <b>have</b> advocated {{a focus on the}} process of discovery without full consideration of the constellation of traits and opportunity that contribute to the creation of secondary knowledge (e.g., Cobb, Yackel, & Wood, 1992). In fact, research on creative-productive individuals suggests that the full constellation of traits that facilitate the discovery and creation of secondary knowledge is rare and not likely reproducible on a large scale (Simonton, 1999a, 1999b, 2003; Sternberg, 1999; Wai, Lubinski, & Benbow, 2005).|$|E
25|$|Hawaiian <b>educators</b> <b>have</b> {{been taking}} {{advantage}} of the Internet in their language revitalization programs. The graphical bulletin board system, Leoki (Powerful Voice), was established in 1994. The content, interface and menus of the system are entirely in the Hawaiian language. It is installed throughout the immersion school system and includes components for e-mails, chat, dictionary and online newspaper among others. In higher institutions such as colleges and universities where the Leoki system is not yet installed, the educators make use of other software and Internet tools such as Daedalus Interchange, e-mails and the Web to connect students of Hawaiian language with the broader community.|$|E
25|$|Reflecting young Earth creationist beliefs, {{the museum}} depicts the {{coexistence}} {{of humans and}} dinosaurs, portrays the Earth as approximately 6,000 years old, and disputes the theory of evolution. Scientists and <b>educators</b> <b>have</b> criticized the museum for misrepresenting science and expressed concerns {{that it could have}} a negative impact on science education. Proponents of other religious beliefs about the Universe's origins—including old Earth creationism, theistic evolution, and intelligent design—have said that its rejection of scientific consensus damages the credibility of Christianity and its adherents. Tenets of Young Earth creationism enjoy substantial support among the general population in the United States, however, contributing to the museum's popularity.|$|E

25|$|There {{has been}} some {{controversy}} over the relative strengths {{of different types of}} research. Because randomized trials provide clear, objective evidence on “what works”, policy makers often take only those studies into consideration. Some scholars have pushed for more random experiments in which teaching methods are randomly assigned to classes. In other disciplines concerned with human subjects, like biomedicine, psychology, and policy evaluation, controlled, randomized experiments remain the preferred method of evaluating treatments. Educational statisticians and some mathematics <b>educators</b> <b>have</b> been working to increase the use of randomized experiments to evaluate teaching methods. On the other hand, many scholars in educational schools have argued against increasing the number of randomized experiments, often because of philosophical objections, such as the ethical difficulty of randomly assigning students to various treatments when the effects of such treatments are not yet known to be effective, or the difficulty of assuring rigid control of the independent variable in fluid, real school settings.|$|E
25|$|The Native American {{language}} education {{movement has}} been met with adversity, such as by English-only campaigns in some areas in the late 1990s. However, Navajo-immersion programs have cropped up across the Navajo Nation. Statistical evidence shows that Navajo-immersion students generally do better on standardized tests than their counterparts educated only in English. Some <b>educators</b> <b>have</b> remarked that students who know their native languages {{feel a sense of}} pride and identity validation. Since 1989, Diné College, a Navajo tribal community college, has offered an associate degree in the subject of Navajo. This program includes language, literature, culture, medical terminology, and teaching courses; includes about 600 students per semester; and produces the highest number of Navajo teachers of any institution in the United States. One major university that teaches classes in the Navajo language is Arizona State University. In 1992, Young and Morgan published another major work on Navajo: Analytical Lexicon of Navajo, with the assistance of Sally Midgette (Navajo). This work is organized by root, the basis of Athabaskan languages.|$|E

25|$|The {{problem is}} further {{exacerbated}} by inadequate resources and trained personnel. Many rural areas – {{where most of}} China's HIV-positive population resides – {{do not have the}} capacity to monitor patients' CD4+ cell counts and viral load. In some cases, the physical infrastructure exists, but staff do not have the skills or reagents to use it. Human resource capacity is a major constraint on China's ability to deliver HIV prevention and care. Many health workers and <b>educators</b> <b>have</b> poor knowledge of HIV and hold their own biases and stigmas towards those at risk or infected with HIV. A substantial proportion of the funds allocated to HIV prevention and control is being spent on establishing training centers and in building the capacity of health workers so that they can deliver better services. But many of those willing to work in rural areas do not have formal medical qualifications to begin with, which limits their abilities to understand the complexities of treating HIV patients. Furthermore, health services rely heavily on user fees, which often encourages health workers to do additional, chargeable services that many people living with HIV/AIDS cannot afford.|$|E
500|$|Caged Bird {{has been}} criticized by many parents, causing it {{to be removed from}} school {{curricula}} and library shelves. [...] The book was approved to be taught in public schools and was placed in public school libraries through the U.S. in the early 1980s, and was included in advanced placement and gifted student curricula, but attempts by parents to censor it began in 1983. [...] It has been challenged in 15 U.S. states. [...] <b>Educators</b> <b>have</b> responded to these challenges by removing it from reading lists and libraries, by providing students with alternatives, and by requiring parental permission from students.

Criticism from social commentators and educators has ranged from asserting that AAVE is an intrinsically deficient form of speech to arguments that its use, by being considered unacceptable in most cultural contexts, is socially limiting. Some of the harshest criticism of AAVE or its use has come from African Americans. A conspicuous example was the [...] "Pound Cake speech", in which Bill Cosby criticized some African Americans for various social behaviors, including the way they talked.|$|E

2500|$|Gadna is an Israeli pre-army {{military}} {{program to}} prepare {{high school students}} for their mandatory service. Gadna was created before the Israeli declaration of independence.

Nowadays, the program concentrates on increasing motivation {{to serve in the}} Army. As of 2007, an estimated minority of 16,000 to 19,000 11th grade pupils annually engage in squad-sized operations, night treks and shooting, with the promise of rewards for excellence when the youth join the Israel Defense Forces. <b>Educators</b> <b>have</b> criticized the program as [...] "overly militaristic".

Sweller and his colleagues argue that novices do not possess the underlying mental models, or [...] "schemas" [...] necessary for [...] "learning by doing" [...] (e.g. Sweller, 1988). Indeed, Mayer (2004) reviewed the literature and found that fifty years of empirical data do not support using the constructivist teaching technique of pure discovery; in those situations requiring discovery, he argues for the use of guided discovery instead.|$|E
