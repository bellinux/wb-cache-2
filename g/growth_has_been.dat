The convention saw interviews, panel discussions, live performances, exclusive video screenings, workshops, contests and giveaways. The 2015 convention was attended by journalists from magazines such as Vanity Fair and Wired as well as television stations, all of which helped further popularize cardistry as an art. Its <b>growth</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> associated with its availability with the availability of videos, lessons and podcasts, which tend to make the art more transparent and available to all who are interested.|$|E
5|$|Since {{opening its}} first store in 1998, the NBA has seen {{increasing}} business opportunities in foreign markets mainly {{due to the}} influx of new international players. The biggest <b>growth</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> in China, where players Yao Ming and Yi Jianlian, combined with the interest generated by the 2008 Summer Olympics, created enough demand to open two new stores. The NBA has also expanded into games like Second Life where it created a virtual NBA Store in 2007.|$|E

During much of its history <b>growth</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> limited by lack of organised water supply and sewerage, though reticulated services for both are now connected.

According to the airline, it is a planned strategy due to the tough aviation environment in India and to focus on maintaining profitability rather than on capturing market share and increasing the destinations and fleet size. As of February 2016, it remains the fifth largest carrier in the country with an 8% market share. The airline is planning for an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in 2016. The airline took delivery of its 20th aircraft in June 2016, making it eligible to operate international flights.|$|E

The Goodyear factory closed in 1983 after failing to make a profit, resulting in the loss of 750 jobs. The facility was later partly occupied by Wilson Double Deck Trailers and DDL Electronics.

Much of the city's recent <b>growth</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> on the west side, and it has the youngest median age of the three. The north side (pop. 26,751) was originally populated by workers from local coal mines. It has the oldest population of the three areas, is home to multiple industrial parks and includes the former Hamlet of Hardieville, which was annexed by Lethbridge in 1978. South Lethbridge (pop. 31,337) is the commercial heart of the city. It contains the downtown core, the bulk of retail and hospitality establishments, and the Lethbridge College.|$|E
