25|$|In {{the case}} of celiac disease, the current {{understanding}} is that tTG autoimmunity arises when T-cells are generated against wheat <b>gliadin</b> and similar gluten proteins made by a class of grasses called Triticeae, which includes wheat (See Wheat taxonomy), barley, and rye. The T-cells are defined by the ability to react to HLA-DQ8 and DQ2.5 restricted antigens and <b>gliadin</b> {{is one of the}} antigens. <b>Gliadin</b> is a favored dietary substrate for transglutaminase because of many enzyme reaction sites on <b>gliadin.</b> In disease, transglutaminase reacts with <b>gliadin</b> forming a linkage. In forming this bond transglutaminase becomes linked to T-cell epitopes on <b>gliadin.</b> B-cells with surface IgM that react to transglutaminase can present it with bound <b>gliadin</b> peptides to T-cells which stimulate B-cell maturation and proliferation to plasma cells making IgA or IgM.|$|E
25|$|Antibody {{recognition}} of gluten is complex. Direct binding to gluten such as anti-gliadin antibodies has an ambiguous pathogenesis in coeliac disease. The crosslinking of <b>gliadin</b> with tissue transglutaminase {{leads to the}} production of anti-transglutaminase antibodies, but this is mediated through T-cell {{recognition of}} <b>gliadin.</b> The allergic recognition of <b>gliadin</b> by mast cells, eosinophiles in the presence of IgE has notable direct consequences, such as exercise-induced anaphylaxis.|$|E

The measurements {{were made in}} water and in 0. 01 M acetate buffer, pH 4. 0 and 5. 0, with and without 0. 1 M NaCl. The concentration of <b>gliadins</b> and WSF was 1. 7 µg/ml. The adsorption of <b>gliadins</b> in water was investigated at three different protein concentrations (0. 17, 1. 7, and 17 µg/ml), and the adsorption {{was found to be}} very high with regard to the low concentrations of protein in solution. The results of the sequential adsorption in water indicated that the WSF adsorbed to preadsorbed <b>gliadins.</b> When proteins of the WSF were adsorbed first, they blocked further adsorption of <b>gliadins.</b> Measurements in acetate buffer at different pH values showed that the effect of pH was larger in the experiments where the <b>gliadins</b> were adsorbed first, both for the initial adsorption and for the sequential addition of WSF. An increase in ionic strength also increased the amount of WSF adsorbed to preadsorbed <b>gliadins.</b> These results indicate that the sequential adsorption of WSF to <b>gliadins</b> is strongly affected by electrostatic interactions...|$|R
40|$|The wheat storage {{proteins}} {{have the}} most important role in defining functional properties of flour. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyse the wheat storage proteins profiles and relative amount by reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). 13 wheat cultivars grown at Agricultural Institute Osijek were investigated. As compared to the other wheat storage protein fractions the average proportion of albumins and globulins was the least (19. 03 %). The albumins and globulins chromatogram profiles were different regarding subunits number (19 - 22) with constant retention time from 7 to 15 minutes. Within <b>gliadins</b> group hidrophobic α- (8 - 10 subunits) and γ- <b>gliadins</b> (6 - 9 subunits) were dominant, while the subunits number of hydrophilic <b>gliadins</b> varied from 1 to 3 for ω 5 - and 3 to 6 for ω 1, 2 - <b>gliadins.</b> According to obtained results α- and γ- <b>gliadins</b> were dominant components of <b>gliadins</b> group in relation to minor ω 5 - and ω 1, 2 - <b>gliadins.</b> The LMW glutenins with 16 to 19 subunits were dominant proteins of glutenins group compared with the HMW glutenins whose subunits number varied from 4 to 6.

The high quality of pasta is attributed to its specific structure, obtained after successive structural changes of the two main semolina components, starch and proteins, <b>gliadins</b> and glutenins, in presence of water. The present study was conducted to examine the contributions of <b>gliadins,</b> glutenins and starch to the structure and functionality of gluten by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).

25|$|The {{immunochemistry}} of Triticeae glutens {{is important}} in several inflammatory diseases. It can be subdivided into innate responses (direct stimulation of immune system), class II mediated presentation (HLA DQ), class I meditiated stimulation of killer cells, and antibody recognition. The responses to gluten proteins and polypeptide regions differs according {{to the type of}} gluten sensitivity. The response is also dependent on the genetic makeup of the human leukocyte antigen genes. In gluten sensitive enteropathy, there are 4 types of recognition, innate immunity (a form of cellular immunity priming), HLA-DQ, and antibody recognition of <b>gliadin</b> and transglutaminase. With idiopathic gluten sensitivity only antibody recognition to <b>gliadin</b> has been resolved. In wheat allergy, the response pathways are mediated through IgE against other wheat proteins and other forms of <b>gliadin.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Gliadins</b> and glutenins are {{the main}} protein {{fractions}} present in wheat gluten. They are responsible for technological and nutritional quality of wheat based products. In particular, glutenins are mainly responsible for dough visco-elastic properties, whereas <b>gliadins</b> confer extensibility to dough and {{are the most important}} factor triggering celiac disease, the major human intolerance to gluten. <b>Gliadins</b> are monomeric proteins, whereas glutenins are polymers stabilized by disulfide bonds. Although they have distinctive structural characteristics, it is possible that some <b>gliadins</b> become part of the glutenin fraction because of mutations that affect cysteine number and distribution. Here, we provide evidence that a naturally mutated γ-gliadin with an extra cysteine residue is incorporated into the polymeric fraction. This goal was achieved using an integrated approach involving heterologous expression, 2 -DE, RP-HPLC and MS...|$|R
40|$|<b>Gliadins</b> {{represent}} alcohol-soluble {{fraction of}} wheat storage proteins {{which is responsible}} for development of celiac disease. The only and effective treatment for celiac disease is strict adherence to a gluten-free diet excluding any food made with wheat, as well as rye, barley and possibly oat flour. Enzymatic modification of wheat <b>gliadins</b> seems to be an alternative method for decreasing of celiac activity. The aim of our study was a trial of enzymatic modification of wheat <b>gliadins</b> using fungal (Aspergillus sp., Aspergillus oryzae, Aspergillus niger) and bacterial (Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Bacillus thermoproteolyticus, Streptomyces griseus) proteases. The reaction was performed up to 60 min, stopped by addition of appropriate synthetic inhibitor and products of limited proteolysis were analyzed by SDS-PAGE method. From fungal proteases most effective proteolytic activity was observed using acid proteinase from A. niger since wheat <b>gliadins</b> and low molecular weight peptides were completely degraded. Bacterial proteases form B. licheniformis and B. thermoproteolyticus acted very effective and as the result of hydrolysis, the products of lower molecular weight (< 15 kDa) occurred. Most of the wheat <b>gliadins</b> were susceptible to proteolysis by examined bacterial enzymes (exception were protease from B. stearothermophilus and S. griseus). Although wheat <b>gliadins</b> are susceptible to enzymatic degradation, further analysis (e. g. immunochemical or mass spectrometry) are desirable to confirm if the products of proteolysis have lost or at least partially decrease their celiac activity...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{characterize}} allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) among children in Fez region. Eighty one children were recruited from the Hospital University Center of Fez. All of them had completed a questionnaire before taking sera. The sera were used to measure total IgE and specific data to proteins of egg's white (EWP), peanuts (PP) and <b>gliadins</b> (G). In last part, we studied the reactivity of specific IgE to native and to heat- and acid-treated allergens. Allergen-specific IgE measurement indicated more positive values for <b>gliadins</b> (46. 9 % up to 2 IU/ml) than egg white's (29. 6 %) and peanut's proteins (22. 2 %). According to predictive values published by Sampson (2001), 14. 3 % of children are sensitive to egg white's proteins, 4. 1 % to <b>gliadins</b> and 2. 7 % to peanut's proteins. The allergenic potential of EWP and <b>gliadins</b> among children were partially diminished by heat and acid treatment. Allergen-specific IgE measurement indicates that children from Fez region are more sensitive to EWP than peanut's proteins and <b>gliadins.</b> Treatments of these food proteins indicated that recognition by children IgE can be reduced by thermal or acid treatment of these allergens...|$|R

40|$|Wheat gluten proteins, <b>gliadins</b> and glutenins, are {{of great}} {{importance}} in determining the unique biomechanical properties of wheat. Studies have therefore been carried out to determine their pathways and mechanisms of synthesis, folding, and deposition in protein bodies. In the present work, a set of transgenic wheat lines has been studied with strongly suppressed levels of γ-gliadins and/or all groups of <b>gliadins,</b> using light and fluorescence microscopy combined with immunodetection using specific antibodies for γ-gliadins and HMW glutenin subunits. These lines represent a unique material to study the formation and fusion of protein bodies in developing seeds of wheat. Higher amounts of HMW subunits were present {{in most of the}} transgenic lines but only the lines with suppression of all <b>gliadins</b> showed differences in the formation and fusion of the protein bodies. Large rounded protein bodies were found in the wild-type lines and the transgenic lines with reduced levels of γ-gliadins, while the lines with all <b>gliadins</b> down-regulated had protein bodies of irregular shape and irregular formation. The size and number of inclusions, which have been reported to contain triticins, were also higher in the protein bodies in the lines with all the <b>gliadins</b> down-regulated. Changes in the protein composition and PB morphology reported in the transgenic lines with all <b>gliadins</b> down-regulated did not result in marked changes in the total protein content or instability of the different fractions. © 2011 The Author.

40|$|Wheat allergy is an IgE-mediated disorder. Polyphenols, {{which are}} known to {{interact}} with certain proteins, {{could be used to}} reduce allergic reactions. This study screened several polyphenol sources for their ability to interact with <b>gliadins,</b> mask epitopes, and affect basophil degranulation. Polyphenol extracts from artichoke leaves, cranberries, apples, and green tea leaves were examined. Of these extracts, the first three formed insoluble complexes with <b>gliadins.</b> Only the cranberry and apple extracts masked epitopes in dot blot assays using anti-gliadin IgG and IgE antibodies from patients with wheat allergies. The cranberry and artichoke extracts limited cellular degranulation by reducing mouse anti-gliadin IgE recognition.

40|$|An all-solid-state {{potentiometric}} electronic tongue with 36 polymeric membranes {{has been}} used {{for the first time to}} detect <b>gliadins,</b> which are primarily responsible for gluten intolerance in people suffering from celiac disease. A linear discriminant model, based on the signals of 11 polymeric membranes, selected from the 36 above using a stepwise procedure, was used to semi-quantitatively classify samples of a “Gluten-free” foodstuff (baby milked flour), previously contaminated with known amounts of <b>gliadins</b> (50 mg/kg), as “Gluten-free”, “Low-Gluten content” or “Gluten-containing”. For this food matrix, the device had sensitivity towards <b>gliadins</b> of 1 – 2 mg/kg and overall sensitivity and specificity of 77 % and 78 %, respectively. Moreover, the device never identified an ethanolic extract containing <b>gliadins</b> as “Gluten-free”. Finally, the system also allowed distinguishing “Gluten-free” and “Gluten-containing” foodstuffs (15 foods, including breads, flours, baby milked flours, cookies and breakfast cereals) with an overall sensitivity and specificity greater than 83 %, using the signals of only 4 selected polymeric membranes (selected using a stepwise procedure). Since only one “Gluten-containing” foodstuff was misclassified as “Gluten-free”, the device could be used as a preliminary tool for quality control of foods for celiac patients.
