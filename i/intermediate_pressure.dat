5|$|Falling {{electricity}} production may be boosted through drilling additional supply boreholes, as at Poihipi and Ohaaki. The Wairakei power station {{has been running}} much longer, with its first unit commissioned in November 1958, and it attained its peak generation of 173MW in 1965, but already the supply of high-pressure steam was faltering, in 1982 being derated to <b>intermediate</b> <b>pressure</b> and the station managing 157MW. Around {{the start of the}} 21st century it was managing about 150MW, then in 2005 two 8MW isopentane systems were added, boosting the station's output by about 14MW. Detailed data are unavailable, being lost due to re-organisations. One such re-organisation in 1996 causes the absence of early data for Poihipi (started 1996), and the gap in 1996/7 for Wairakei and Ohaaki; half-hourly data for Ohaaki's first few months of operation are also missing, as well as for most of Wairakei's history.|$|E
25|$|The piston in {{the first}} stage is rigid and acts {{directly}} on the seat of the valve. The pressure in the <b>intermediate</b> <b>pressure</b> chamber drops when the diver inhales from the second stage valve, this causes the piston to lift off the stationary valve seat as the piston slides into the <b>intermediate</b> <b>pressure</b> chamber. The now open valve permits high pressure gas to flow into the medium pressure chamber until the pressure in the chamber has risen enough to push the piston back into its original position against the seat and thus close the valve.|$|E
25|$|Most {{regulators}} have two stages. The first stage is a fixed-pressure regulator, which releases {{gas from the}} cylinder at a constant <b>intermediate</b> <b>pressure,</b> despite the pressure in the cylinder falling as the gas in it is consumed. This {{is similar to the}} first stage of a scuba-diving regulator. The adjustable second stage of the regulator controls the pressure reduction from the <b>intermediate</b> <b>pressure</b> to the low outlet pressure. The regulator has two pressure gauges, one indicating cylinder pressure, the other indicating hose pressure. The adjustment knob of the regulator is sometimes roughly calibrated for pressure, but an accurate setting requires observation of the gauge.|$|E
40|$|International audienceElucidating pressure-induced {{structural}} {{transitions in}} glasses at a microscopic level {{is a formidable}} challenge. Here, the local environment of amorphous germania (a-GeO 2) is investigated, from room pressure up to 18 GPa, using in situ inelastic x-ray-scattering measurements at the oxygen K-edge. The appearance of GeO 5 units at <b>intermediate</b> <b>pressures,</b> a debated yet unsolved issue in the literature, is probed experimentally and their amount quantified. It is found that these units are minority species at all the pressures investigated, discarding the previously proposed fully pentacoordinated glassy state. The presence of GeO 5 units, which occur as transient species as the glass undergoes a transition from the tetrahedral to octahedral Ge-coordination states, provides a microscopic basis for the understanding of glass behavior at <b>intermediate</b> <b>pressures...</b>|$|R

Deformation mechanisms and defect substructures at different pressures were analyzed. Current evidence suggests a deformation substructure consisting of twinning at the higher pressures and heavily dislocated laths and dislocation cells at the <b>intermediate</b> and lower <b>pressures,</b> respectively. Evidence of stacking faults at the <b>intermediate</b> <b>pressures</b> was also found.

30|$|The {{challenge}} in using electrospray with an electrostatic accelerator {{stems from the}} need for differential pumping, i.e., the spray must be done at or near atmospheric pressure, and the gases pumped away. The source must reside within the high voltage ball, so gases must be exhausted or pumped through a large potential difference. At <b>intermediate</b> <b>pressures</b> (where the Paschen curve is at a minimum) discharge occurs at lower voltages.|$|R

25|$|Qantas Flight 32: an Airbus A380 {{flying from}} London Heathrow to Sydney (via Singapore) in 2010 had an {{uncontained}} failure in a Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engine. The failure {{was found to}} have been caused by a misaligned counter bore within a stub oil pipe leading to a fatigue fracture. This in turn led to an oil leakage followed by an oil fire in the engine. The fire led to the release of the <b>Intermediate</b> <b>Pressure</b> Turbine (IPT) disc. The airplane, however, landed safely. This led to the grounding of the entire Qantas A380 fleet.|$|E

25|$|The {{diaphragm}} is {{a flexible}} cover to the medium (<b>intermediate)</b> <b>pressure</b> chamber. When the diver consumes {{gas from the}} second stage, the pressure falls in the medium pressure chamber and the diaphragm deforms inwards pushing against the valve lifter. This opens the high pressure valve permitting gas to flow past the valve seat into the medium-pressure chamber. When the diver stops inhaling, pressure in the medium pressure chambers rises and the diaphragm returns to its neutral flat position and no longer presses on the valve lifter shutting off the flow until the next breath is taken.|$|E
25|$|The {{distribution}} network used three different pressure levels. The lowest pressure level served for {{the drinking water}} supply, the intermediate and the high pressure level served as hydraulic power network. The <b>intermediate</b> <b>pressure</b> level had an operating pressure of 6.5 bar and was reached 1896 a length of 82km. It was used for powering 130 water engines type Schmid with a gross power of 230hp. The high pressure network had an operating pressure of 14 bar and reached an extension of 93km. It was used to power 207 turbines and motors, as well as elevator drives. The gross power was 3000hp.|$|E
25|$|The single hose regulator, with a mouth held {{demand valve}} {{supplied}} with <b>intermediate</b> <b>pressure</b> {{gas from the}} cylinder valve mounted first stage, was invented by Australian Ted Eldred in the early 1950s in response to patent restrictions and stock shortages of the Cousteau-Gagnan apparatus in Australia. In France, 1955, a patent was taken out by Bronnec & Gauthier for a single hose regulator, later produced as the Cristal Explorer. Over time, the convenience and performance of improved single hose regulators would make them the industry standard. Performance continues to be improved by small increments, and adaptations have been applied to rebreather technology.|$|E
40|$|Organic vapor {{adsorption}} isotherms are measured on in situ grown carbon nanotube (CNT) films using piezoelectric GaPO 4 crystal microbalances as mass sensing substrates. The isotherms are Type IV and show adsorption/desorption hysteresis, {{consistent with a}} porous material. The measured porosity is 2 percent, a value surprisingly low given an over 90 percent void volume in the film estimated from density considerations. At low pressures (p/p 0 < 0. 25) the isotherm is well fit by the Freundlich model and at <b>intermediate</b> <b>pressures</b> (p/p 0 = 0. 12 ̆ 0130. 4) by the Brunauer, Emmett, Teller (BET) model. Monte Carlo simulations show three consecutive adsorption processes: filling of the intratube micropores at low pressures, monolayer coverage of the CNT external surface at <b>intermediate</b> <b>pressures,</b> and capillary condensation in the intertube mesopores at high pressures. The simulation results validate {{the use of the}} BET model for surface area analysis in the experimental system. The average total accessible surface area is found to be 180 1 100 mm 2 and the specific surface area is estimated to be 45 1 25 m 2 /g.

The isotherms are fully reversible at relatively low and high <b>pressures</b> while at <b>intermediate</b> <b>pressures</b> there is hysteresis related to the hydride formation and decomposition.

25|$|<b>Intermediate</b> <b>pressure</b> creep: This {{is a slow}} leak of {{the first}} stage valve. The effect is for the {{interstage}} pressure to rise until either the next breath is drawn, or the pressure exerts more force on the second stage valve than can be resisted by the spring, and the valve opens briefly, often with a popping sound, to relieve the pressure. {{the frequency of the}} popping pressure relief depends on the flow in the second stage, the back pressure, the second stage spring tension and the magnitude of the leak. It may range from occasional loud pops to a constant hiss. Underwater the second stage may be damped by the water and the loud pops may become an intermittent or constant stream of bubbles. This is not usually a catastrophic failure mode, but should be fixed as it will get worse, and it wastes gas.|$|E
500|$|Coal is {{fed into}} one of 30 coal bunkers, each with a {{capacity}} of 1,000 tonnes. Each bunker feeds two of the 60 pulverisers, each of which can crush 36 tonnes of coal an hour. [...] The station has six Babcock Power boilers, each weighing 4,000 tonnes. The powdered coal from ten pulverisers is blasted into each boiler through burners, which are ignited by propane. In 2003 the original burners were replaced by low nitrogen oxide burners. Each of the six boilers feed steam to a steam turbine set, consisting of one high pressure (HP) turbine, one <b>intermediate</b> <b>pressure</b> (IP) turbine and three low pressure (LP) turbines. The HP turbines generate at 140 megawatts (MW). Exhaust steam from them is fed back to the boiler and reheated, then fed to the 250MW IP turbines and finally passes through the 90MW LP turbines. This gives each generating set a generating capacity of 660MW: with six generating sets, the station has a total capacity of 3,960MW.

40|$|The {{disruption}} of caseinmicelles, {{as found in}} cows’ milk, was investigated at pressures up to 300 MPa with small angle neutron scattering (SANS). From the decrease of the overall level of scattering, the expected {{disruption of}} the micelles was concluded. This disruption was incomplete, and stable at 300 MPa, independent of <b>pressure</b> history. At <b>intermediate</b> <b>pressures,</b> pressure history, (step-wise increase from ambient, or stepwise decrease from 300 MPa) had a strong effect on the scattering patterns.

One size was outside the window of quantitative observation and may be {{similar to that of}} the native micelles or residual fat globules, the other smaller size, found under high pressure is in the 10 – 20 nm range and may correspond clusters of about 10 separate casein molecules.
