5|$|Hambleton, whose {{call sign}} was Bat 21 Bravo, was {{positioned}} immediately behind the pilot, {{who gave the}} signal for everyone to <b>eject.</b> Hambleton pulled the ejection seat handles and had a moment {{to make eye contact}} with the pilot as his seat rocketed out of the dying plane. A moment later, the aircraft was struck by a second SA-2 and exploded. The remainder of the aircraft's six-man crew—Maj. Wayne L. Bolte, pilot; 1st Lt.. Robin F. Gatwood, co-pilot; and EWOs Lt. Col. Anthony R. Giannangeli, Lt. Col. Charles A. Levis, and Maj. Henry M. Serex—were unable to <b>eject</b> and were listed as missing in action. Their remains were never found.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases of}} ditched {{aircraft}}, pilots {{have been able}} to <b>eject</b> safely in several cases. However, fatal aircraft crashes have occurred; in 1994, Lt.

40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of {{ejection}} on end-systolic pressure in isolated heart preparations. <b>Ejecting</b> beats were compared with isovolumic beats having the same volume as at end systole. While holding end-systolic volume constant, various stroke volumes, including negative stroke volumes (volume injected during systole), were imposed using a predetermined volume command. After switching contraction mode between <b>ejecting</b> and isovolumic, we measured the immediate and steady changes in end-systolic pressure. In the first isovolumic beat after switching from steady-state <b>ejecting</b> beats, the change in end-systolic pressure was variable, depending on the stroke volume. The end-systolic pressure of the <b>ejecting</b> beat exceeded that of the isovolumic beat on average by up to 18 mm Hg with small stroke volume, but the <b>ejecting</b> end-systolic pressure became lower than isovolumic with either large stroke volume (stroke volume/end-systolic volume < 0. 96) or with negative stroke volume. During the transient phase following a switch from <b>ejecting</b> to isovolumic, the end-systolic pressure gradually decreased to a steady state. Consequently, even in steady state, <b>ejecting</b> end-systolic pressure exceeded isovolumic pressure over a significant range of stroke volume (stroke volume/end-systolic volume < 1. 18). After returning contraction mode from isovolumic back to <b>ejecting,</b> w...|$|R

5|$|Strombolian eruptions <b>eject</b> {{volcanic}} {{bombs and}} lapilli fragments that travel in parabolic paths before landing around their source vent.

5|$|Taken together, {{analyses}} {{indicate that}} the impactor was large enough to create a 120-mile peak ring, to melt, shock and <b>eject</b> granite from many miles within the earth, to create colossal water movements, and to <b>eject</b> an immense quantity of vaporized rock and sulfates into the atmosphere, where they would have persisted over years to decades. This global dispersal of dust and sulfates would {{have led to a}} sudden and catastrophic effect on the climate worldwide, large temperature drops, and devastated the food chain. The researchers stated that the impact generated an environmental calamity that extinguished life, but it also induced a vast subsurface hydrothermal system that became an oasis for the recovery of life.|$|E

5|$|Even {{within the}} theatre itself there was division. Rieger led a {{campaign}} to <b>eject</b> Smetana from the conductorship and reappoint Maýr, and in December 1872 a petition signed by 86subscribers to the theatre called for Smetana's resignation. Strong support from vice-chairman Antonín Čísek, and an ultimatum from prominent musicians among whom was Antonín Dvořák, ensured Smetana's survival. In January 1873 he was reappointed, with a bigger salary and increased responsibility as Artistic Director.|$|E

5|$|It was determined, however, {{that both}} crewmembers aboard the Marine F-4B could {{have survived the}} collision. Further {{investigation}} by the NTSB revealed a design flaw in the ejector seat and canopy assemblies of the fighter plane whereby the pilot would probably {{not be able to}} <b>eject</b> if the radar intercept officer ejected first. Since the specific design of ejector seats installed in the F-4B were not intended to be fired through the aircraft's canopy, a circuit breaker kept the seat from ejecting if the canopy was in place. Once the canopy was manually unlocked, the ejector seat circuit was completed and could be fired. This specific design of ejector seat, however, had a tendency of being unable to complete the circuit in the pilot's ejector seat if the aft ejector seat was fired first. The F-4B aircraft {{were in the process of}} being modified with a newly designed canopy when the collision occurred. Aircraft based at MCAS El Toro were slated to begin upgrades in July 1971; at the time of the collision, BuNo 151458 was still operating with the original canopy configuration, and the pilot was consequently unable to <b>eject</b> from the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Mallards are opportunistically {{targeted}} by brood parasites, occasionally having eggs laid in their nests by redheads, ruddy ducks, lesser scaup, gadwalls, northern shovellers, northern pintails, cinnamon teal, common goldeneyes, and other mallards. These eggs are generally accepted when they resemble the eggs {{of the host}} mallard, but the hen may attempt to <b>eject</b> them or even abandon the nest if parasitism occurs during egg laying.|$|E
5|$|Marine {{molluscs}} such as sea hares, cuttlefish, squid and octopuses {{give themselves}} a {{last chance to}} escape by distracting their attackers. To do this, they <b>eject</b> a mixture of chemicals, which may mimic food or otherwise confuse predators. In response to a predator, animals in these groups release ink, creating a cloud, and opaline, affecting the predator's feeding senses, causing it to attack the cloud.|$|E
