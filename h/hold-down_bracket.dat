25|$|The {{maximum width}} of a PCI card is 15.24mm (0.6inches). Two bracket heights have been specified, known as full-height and low-profile. The bracket or {{backplate}} is the part that fastens to the card cage to stabilize the card. It also usually contains external connectors, so it attaches in a window in the computer case so any connectors are accessible from outside. The backplate is typically fixed to the case by either a 6-32 or M3 screw, or with a separate <b>hold-down</b> <b>bracket</b> {{that is part of}} the case.|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{cycling test}} {{was required to}} verify {{the integrity of the}} welded joints and the thin wall tube bends in the primary loop manifold assembly of a four pack thermo electric module and to help establish structural and mechanical requirements of any possible redesign. The test section was subjected to more severe loading conditions than will be experienced during actual operating conditions. The test was a mechanical simulation of the differential thermal expansion which occurs due to the approximately 600 {degrees} F temperature differential in the subassembly. The actual load exerted on the test section represented this deflection. The effects on the joints and tube material were observed. The test was conducted on a test segment of manifold designed to duplicate two of the flexible elbows; the transition joints between the elbows and the tubular module inner clad; and the welded joints of the elbows to the primary loop header. The assembled test segment and <b>hold-down</b> <b>bracket</b> are shown. The bracket was mounted {{to the base of the}} Universal Test Machine. Dial indicators measured the relative displacement between the line of applied load (through the vertical axis of the primary loop header) and the attachment point at the holddown bracket. In the first test, the load was applied in fifty pound increments until the relative displacement of nine mils was measured between the loop header and the welded joint on the feedline elbow. The remaining tests were cycling the header assembly at increasing relative displace ment. The summary of these tests are tabulated. The testing had no noticeable affect on the structural integrity of the weldment...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the seismic design of multi-storey buildings made from cross-laminated timber panels (‘crosslam’). The use of seismic analysis {{methods such as}} the modal response spectrum and the non-linear static (push-over) analysis is discussed at length, including {{issues such as the}} modelling of crosslam walls and connections, the evaluation of the connection stiffness, and the schematization of floor panels. It was found that it is crucial to account for the flexibility of the connections (<b>hold-downs</b> and angle <b>brackets)</b> between upper and lower walls, since otherwise the vibration periods of the building would be underestimated. The basics of capacity design to ensure the attainment of ductile mechanisms in crosslam timber structures under seismic actions are presented. The ductile failure mechanism is characterized by plasticization of connectors (<b>hold-downs,</b> angle <b>brackets</b> and screws) between adjacent wall panels and between panels and foundations. The crosslam panels and the connections between adjacent floor panels must be designed for the overstrength of the connectors to ensure that they remain elastic during the earthquake and the ductile failure mechanism is attained. Based on the results of preliminary quasi-static cyclic tests, a value of 1. 3 was found for the overstrength factors of <b>hold-downs</b> and angle <b>brackets.</b> A case study multi-storey crosslam massive wooden building was then analysed using the non-linear push-over analysis as implemented in the N 2 method recommended by the Eurocode 8. The building was modelled using shell elements and non-linear links to schematize the <b>hold-downs</b> and angle <b>brackets.</b> The building ductility, calculated from the bilinear curve equivalent to the actual non-linear push-over curve, was then investigated. Such a quantity, defined as the ratio of the displacement at the near collapse state and the maximum elastic displacement of the top floor, was found to rise from 1. 7 to 2. 5 when ductile instead of brittle <b>hold-downs</b> and angle <b>brackets</b> are used. Furthermore, the maximum peak ground acceleration the building can resist raised from 0. 2 g to 0. 4 g, demonstrating the importance of using ductile connectors in seismic design...|$|R
40|$|Multi-storey {{platform}} cross {{laminated timber}} (CLT) structures are becoming progressively desirable for engineers and owners. This is because they offer many significant advantages such as speed of fabrication, ease of construction, and excellent strength to weight ratio. With platform construction, stories are fixed together {{in a way that}} each floor bears into load bearing walls, therewith creating a platform for the next level. The latest research findings have shown that CLT platform buildings constructed with traditional fasteners can experience a high level of damage especially in those cases where the walls have adopted <b>hold-down</b> <b>brackets</b> and shear connectors with nails, rivets or screws. Thus, the current construction method for platform CLT structures is less than ideal in terms of damage avoidance. The main objective {{of this study is to}} develop a low damage platform timber panelised structural system using a new configuration of slip friction devices in lieu of traditional connectors. A numerical model of such a system is developed for a low rise CLT building and then is subjected to reversed cyclic load simulations in order to investigate its seismic performance. The result of these quasi-static simulations demonstrated that the system maintained the strength through numerous cycles of loading and unloading. In addition to this, the system is capable of absorbing significant amount of energy. The findings of this study demonstrate the proposed concept has the potential to be developed as a low damage seismic solution for CLT platform buildings...|$|R
40|$|The {{performances}} of nailed timber shear walls subjected to in-plane horizontal actions are numerically investigated in the paper. In particular, {{it focuses on}} the different behavior that the vertical diaphragm may perform if the wall base steel devices {{are connected to the}} timber frame with or without the interposition of the sheathing. Nonlinear static analyses were performed and the dissipative capacity is concentrated in the connections among the components (nails, <b>hold-down,</b> angle <b>brackets,</b> stud-joist node), whose behavior is calibrated by means of experimental tests and numerical simulations on connections. The reliability of the numerical model was proved by comparing the numerical results with the findings of five full-scale experimental tests performed on shear walls subjected to in-plane horizontal cyclic loads. It emerged that the different arrangements of the base connections influence significantly the distribution of the shear among the sheathing nails and, when the base steel devices are applied with the sheathing interposed and/or the panels are nailed to a base timber plate, the force distribution among the fasteners significantly differs from those suggested by the analytical methods proposed in the literature...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{mechanical}} and the hysteretic behaviour of steel-to-timber joints with annular-ringed shank nails in Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT). These fasteners {{are used to}} anchor typical metal connectors, such as <b>hold-downs</b> and angle <b>brackets,</b> to the CLT panels. The experimental pro- gramme presented in the paper was carried out at the Institute of Timber Engineering and Wood Technology, Graz University of Technology (Graz, Austria). Average and characteristic values of the exper- imental strength capacities are evaluated and compared to the analytical predictions determined accord- ing to current structural design codes and literature. Furthermore, to fulfil {{the requirements of the}} capacity-based design, the overstrength factor and the strength degradation factor are evaluated and con- servative values are recommended...|$|R
40|$|In {{timber frame}} buildings, a good {{estimation}} of the performances of wall diaphragms assumes a great importance for a correct seismic or wind design, as the resistance and displacement capacity of the vertical resisting elements influence the distribution of horizontal forces. The paper focuses on the prediction, by means of numerical simulations, of the capacity curve of nailed timber frame shear walls subjected to in-plane horizontal actions. Non-linear static-analysis were performed assuming that the dissipative capacity of the panel is concentrated in the mechanical connections of the components (nails, <b>hold-down,</b> angle <b>brackets).</b> To assess {{the reliability of the}} numerical model, shear walls of different dimensions and connection arrangements were tested under in-plane horizontal cyclic loads. Comparisons between numerical and experimental results prove the validity of the model. Moreover it is evidenced that the distribution of the shear among the sheathing perimetric fasteners is affected by the application method of the steel connections at the base. In particular, when the hold down and/or the angle brackets are applied on the sheathing (not directly on the timber frame), the force distribution among the sheathing fasteners significantly differs from those suggested by the analytical methods proposed in the literature leading to erroneous predictions of the wall capacity. In these cases, the actual fastener orientation effectiveness has to be considered in the model for a correct prediction of the in-plane performance of the shear wall...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{numerical}} model {{to estimate the}} dissipative capacity and describe the cyclic response of cross-laminated (X-lam) timber buildings is presented. The connections between panels and to the foundation (metal <b>hold-downs</b> and angle <b>brackets,</b> and screwed connectors) are modelled with nonlinear hysteretic multispring elements {{taking into account the}} strength interaction between different degrees of freedom according to a predefined domain. The timber components (solid X-lam floors and wall panels) are modelled using elastic shell elements. By calibration on experimental cyclic tests carried out on each degree of freedom, important features of timber connection behaviour such as post-peak strength, pinching and stiffness degradation can all be considered. In addition, the effect of friction at the interface between panels and with foundation can be taken into account. These springs have been implemented as external subroutines in a widespread software package such as Abaqus. By comparison with the experimental results of cyclic tests carried out on single X-lam walls, coupled X-lam walls and a single-storey X-lam building, the accuracy of the proposed model is demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} behaviour of steel-to-timber joints with annular-ringed shank nails is investigated using numerical modelling and a component approach. These joints {{are used in}} Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT) buildings to anchor metal connectors such as <b>hold-downs</b> and angle <b>brackets</b> to the timber panels. At first, a general hysteresis model is introduced, where a single fastener joint is schematized as an elasto-plastic beam embedded in a non-linear medium with a compression-only behaviour. A second hysteresis model is then presented, where the {{mechanical behaviour}} of the joint is simulated by a non-linear spring with three degrees of freedom. Both models are calibrated on the design rules prescribed by the reference standards. Moreover, average strength capacities are determined from the corresponding characteristic values assuming a standard normal distribution and suitable coefficients of variation. As first applicative examples of the proposed models, shear tests are simulated on single steel-to-timber joints with annular-ringed shank nails and on a connection made of an angle bracket and sixty nails. The scatter of mechanical properties in steel-to-timber joints is also {{taken into account in}} the simulations and a stochastic approach is proposed, demonstrating acceptable accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT) {{is gaining}} a {{significant}} popularity among the structural products as a sustainable alternative to steel and concrete. In comparison with those traditional building materials, CLT {{has a low}} carbon footprint and provides comfortable living conditions; moreover, the high strength-to-weight ratio, the prefabrication process and the erection speed are additional key points of its broad diffusion. Determining the load-carrying capacity of lateral load-resisting systems made of CLT panels (such as CLT wall systems, i. e. CLT walls with mechanical connections) is crucial for both the static and seismic design of CLT structures. However, a calculation method {{has not yet been}} included in Eurocode 5 (EN 1995 - 1 - 1 : 2004 /A 2 2014). Nowadays, the load-carrying capacity of CLT wall systems is determined with forcebased design procedures. However, since the analysis neglects the connections stiffness, those methods do not ensure that the wall system behaves in accordance with the design assumptions. Furthermore, simplified methods neglect some contributions that might affect the response of a CLT wall system, like the friction between the wall and the element that is restrained to and the effect of the overlaying floor. Based on the above-mentioned issues, this paper proposes a new numerical model of a CLT wall system. The model schematizes the CLT panel as an elastic orthotropic element, while the connections (i. e. <b>hold-downs,</b> angle <b>brackets,</b> and screws) are simulated as non-linear hysteretic springs. The interaction between the CLT panel and the foundation, and between the wall element and the CLT floor restrained on top of it, were specifically addressed {{in the development of the}} model. The study presented herein is carried out considering the experimental tests results obtained by Gavric et al. (2015 a- 2015 b- 2015 c). At first, experimental and numerical results are compared. A parametric study is carried out afterwards, (a) by varying the vertical load applied on top of the CLT wall, (b) by modifying the aspect ratio of the timber panel, and (c) by simulating a CLT floor screwed on top of the wall. Results are collected in diagrams and compared with a simplified design procedure commonly adopted by practicing engineers and discussed by Pozza et al. (2016 b), highlighting how those contributions influence the elastic stiffness and the load-carrying capacity of a CLT wall system...|$|R
40|$|An {{extended}} experimental programme on typical cross-laminated (CLT) connections {{was performed}} at IVALSA Trees and Timber Institute. The paper discusses {{the results of}} monotonic and cyclic tests in shear and tension (pull-out) carried out on hold-downs and steel angle brackets used to anchor the wall panels to foundations or to connect wall panels to floor panels. Mechanical properties such as strength, stiffness, energy dissipation, impairment of strength and ductility were evaluated and are critically discussed in the paper. Significant ductility and energy dissipation was attained {{in most of the}} tests. Nevertheless, brittle failure modes were observed in some tests, indicating the need for introduction of capacity based design principles for CLT connections. The overstrength factors, which are needed for capacity based design, were also evaluated for the different types of connection tested. A comparison between the test results and the analytical formulas provided by current codes of practice and new proposals is also provided. The approach developed by Uibel and Bla&# 223; gives slightly more accurate CLT metal strength predictions compared to the existing formulas in Eurocode 5. Both approaches lead to very conservative results. However, analytical models for the prediction of CLT metal connectors’ stiffness significantly overestimate the experimental values. Therefore, it is recommended that currently only experimental strength and stiffness values of <b>hold-downs</b> and angle <b>brackets</b> be used in seismic analyses. Some proposals to improve the mechanical performance of metal connectors in terms of strength and stiffness are also given based on this experimental and analytical study...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the late}} 90 s, {{prefabricated}} solutions for timber structures widely {{refer to the}} use of Xlam panels (also known as CroosLam, CLT or BSP). They can provide load-bearing capacity for both wall and floor elements, ensuring a tri-dimensional distribution of strength and stiffness with low masses, particularly effective in seismic areas. Nevertheless, connections among panels, and between panels and foundation have {{a crucial role in the}} overall mechanical performance of the structure. Particularly in case of dynamic actions, e. g., earthquakes, ductile steel devices, e. g., <b>hold-down</b> or angle <b>bracket</b> types, are commonly adopted to connect vertical panels to the foundation and to dissipate energy at the base of the building. Nevertheless, these solutions fail locally in the area nailed to the timber elements, thus providing a limited dissipation capacity and inducing an irreversible damage to the panels. In the paper, an optimized-shape device for the connection of construction elements, able to control the energy dissipation in the seismic zone is proposed. It combines the geometrical and mechanical characteristics of the above mentioned common connectors with the capacity of damper systems, specifically designed to distribute gradually the plasticization in the steel elements. The improved device can be designed to provide strength and stiffness even higher than the most common hold-down connectors, but avoiding the damage of the joined construction elements. Moreover, it can be easily removed and substituted after damage due to the seismic event, if needed. The new device is object of application for Italian Patent n.
