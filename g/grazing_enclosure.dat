40|$|I used a field {{experiment}} {{to test the}} hypothesis that waterfowl affect not only the abundance, but also the composition of submerged plant communities. A simple community was chosen for this purpose, composed of two taxa with contrasting distributions along a depth (shore-centre) gradient.

(dominant at deeper areas) co-exists with Zannichellia spp. (dominant at shallower areas). Results indicated that selective waterfowl foraging may affect community composition, through a variety of effects that include: (a) a reduction in the standing crop of Zannichellia, which was selectively foraged and (b) indirect effects on the survival of asexual propagules (tubers) in the less-foraged species, P. pectinatus, mediated by changes in tuber size and burial depth.

30|$|The {{cultivation}} and <b>grazing</b> <b>enclosure</b> regime integrates intensive {{production of}} market-oriented crops and rearing of improved livestock breeds. Commonly cultivated crops within this regime include maize and beans. Individuals practising this regime tend to keep improved breeds which have higher productivity, particularly for milk, and higher {{demand in the}} market due to their productivity (milk and meat). Pasture availability for those inhabiting the wetter regions of Chepareria (Ywalateke) supports livestock production in this regime. This coupled with supplemental livestock feeds from crop residues maintains the production of livestock even during the dry period. It is therefore common in Ywalateke location (43.4  %), which is a mixed farming livelihood zone (Fig.  2) which can support rain-fed agriculture. The increasing practice of this regime in the wetter regions of Chepareria reaffirms the observation of others (BurnSilver 2007; Galvin 2009). They all reported increasing adoption of crop cultivation among pastoralists in East Africa who inhabit areas that can support rain-fed production.|$|E
40|$|Aims Our {{objectives}} are to compare soil respiration rate and its temperature sensitivity at different land use types and discuss soil respiration response to soil temperature (Ts) and soil water content at different soil depths. Methods Periodic measurements of soil respiration rates (Rs) were made during August–October 2009 with a LI- 8100 portable automated soil CO 2 flux system in three agro-pastoral ecotone land use types: cropland, abandoned cultivated land and <b>grazing</b> <b>enclosure.</b> Soil temperature and soil water content at 0 – 5, 5 – 10 and 10 – 15 cm depths were measured simultaneous {{adjacent to the}} soil collar.

Rs exhibited a unimodal curve during 6 : 00 – 18 : 00, with a maximum during 12 : 00 – 15 : 00. Rs decreased with Ts, so Rs was significantly higher in August than in September and October. With the Van’t Hoff model, we concluded thereis a positive, exponential relationship between measured Ts and Rs. In addition, temperature sensitivity of soil respiration (Q 10), which {{is derived from the}} Van’t Hoff model, was largest in cropland.

40|$|Grasslands {{are often}} grazed by cattle and many {{grassland}} birds nest on the ground, potentially exposing nests to trampling. We tested for trampling risk introduced by cattle to nests of endangered Florida Grasshopper Sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum floridanus) using experimentally paired grids of artificial nests (i. e., clay targets) similar {{in size to}} nests of Florida Grasshopper Sparrows and counted the number of clay targets that were broken in paired <b>grazed</b> and ungrazed <b>enclosures.</b> Clay targets in grazed grids were trampled 3. 9 % more often than their respective ungrazed grids, and measurements of cattle presence or density were correlated {{with the number of}} broken clay targets, suggesting that excluding cattle during breeding is an important management recommendation for the Florida Grasshopper Sparrow. Trampling rates within <b>grazed</b> <b>enclosures</b> were spatially homogeneous with respect to cattle infrastructure such as supplemental feeding troughs and fences, and forests and stocking density were poor predictors of trampling rates when excluding ungrazed grids. We used population viability analysis to compare quasi-extinction rates, intrinsic growth rates, and median abundance in grazed and ungrazed Florida Grasshopper Sparrow aggregations to further understand the biological significance of management aimed at reducing trampling rates during the breeding season. Simulations indicated that trampling from grazing increased quasi-extinction rates by 41 % while reducing intrinsic growth rates by 0. 048, and reducing median abundance by an average of 214 singing males after 50 years. Management should avoid <b>grazing</b> <b>enclosures</b> occupied by Florida Grasshopper Sparrows during the nesting season to minimize trampling rates.

40|$|A {{study to}} {{determine}} carbon sequestration potentials and soil attributes was conducted in Borana rangelands of southern Ethiopia under communally <b>grazed</b> areas, <b>grazing</b> <b>enclosures</b> (rangelands enclosed for 20 years for dry season grazing) and rangelands managed by prescribed fire {{for more than five}} years after fire application. Soil attributes were collected from three soil depths (0 – 10 cm, 10 – 20 cm and 20 – 30 cm) and both aboveground and belowground carbon were estimated in all treatments. Belowground carbon stocks were higher than the aboveground carbon stocks in all management systems in Borana rangelands. Tree and shrub carbon and soil organic carbon stocks were higher (P < 0. 01) in rangelands enclosed for 20 years than other rangeland management systems, whereas grass carbon stocks was higher (P < 0. 05) in rangelands managed by prescribed fire. Total carbon stock was higher (P < 0. 01) in enclosed rangeland areas (300. 4 t C ha− 1) than in rangelands managed by prescribed fire (184. 9 t C ha− 1) and in communally grazed areas (141. 5 t C ha− 1). Therefore, rangelands enclosed for more than 20 years for dry season grazing and rangelands managed by prescribed fire had good carbon sequestration potentials both in the soils and aboveground vegetation. Consequently, pastoralists land management can be an important source for sequestering carbon to offset carbon emissions as mitigation of climate change. Peer Revie...|$|R
40|$|In Sehoul, Morocco, {{the use of}} {{marginal}} land for agriculture became a necessity for the local population due to increased poverty and the occupation of the best land by new owners. Desertification poses an additional threat to agricultural production on marginal slopes, which are often stony and degraded. In a participatory process embedded in the EU DESIRE research project, potential sustainable land management measures were selected to address land degradation and desertification. Promising experiences with no-tillage practices elsewhere in Morocco had motivated the Moroccan government to promote conservation agriculture throughout the country. This combination of crop rotation, minimal soil disturbance and soil cover maintenance, however, {{had not yet been}} tested on sloping degraded land. Field trials of <b>grazing</b> <b>enclosure</b> combined with no or minimum tillage were conducted on the plots of two farmers, and trial results were analyzed based on stakeholders' criteria. Results suggest that increased soil cover with barley residues improved rainwater use efficiency and yields only slightly, although soil water was generally enhanced. Soil moisture measurements revealed that no-tillage was favorable mainly at soil depths of 5 cm and in connection with low-rainfall events (< 20 mm); under these circumstances, moisture content was generally higher under no-tillage than under conventional tillage. Moreover, stakeholder discussion confirmed that farmers in Sehoul remain primarily interested in animal husbandry and are reluctant to change the current grazing system. Implementation of conservation agriculture is thus challenged both by the degraded, sloping and stony nature of the land, and by the socio-economic circumstances in Sehou...|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} talus slopes co-evolving with {{vegetation}} cover is investigated on the Trotternish Ridge, Isle of Skye, Scotland.   This uses several lines of contemporary and palaeoenvironmental evidence.   Through a replicated set of <b>grazing</b> <b>enclosures,</b> {{the composition and}} structure of present-day vegetation is linked to contemporary grazing regimes and slope erosion processes.   Vegetation history is reconstructed from the fossil pollen content of organic palaeosols intercalated within the talus deposits.   A new method using Long Chain Alcohols is used to support {{the interpretation of the}} fossil pollen records.   Geomorphological development is revealed through analysis of talus stratigraphy and the sedimentary deposits immediately below the slopes.   These lines of evidence are combined to construct a conceptual model for talus co-evolution on the Trotternish Ridge.   Talus development began as the climate warmed from around 17. 5 k cal yrs BP, and the glaciers of the last Ice Age retreated.   Slopes initially comprised rockfall debris, with a sparse cover of vegetation having little or no effect on slope processes.   Heathland and grassland vegetation, evidenced by the organic palaeosols, was intermittently present on the talus slope surfaces from 7. 7 - 7. 6 k cal yr BP until approximately 0. 6 - 0. 5 k cal yr BP.   This vegetation cover limited physical and hydrological surface processes, enabling {{the upper part of the}} talus slopes to over-steepen.   Evidence of increased frequency of organic palaeosol burial, and increased rates of sediment deposition after around 2. 0 k cal yr BP, both indicate greater debris flow and other erosional activity in the late Holocene.   This is attributed to both increased incidence of intense rainfall events and much higher levels of grazing associated with the introduction of cattle, sheep and rabbits.   Contemporary evidence shows that heavy grazing changes the vegetation composition and structure, and increases susceptibility to erosion.   Talus co-evolution on the Trotternish Ridge may be similar to that at other British and Faroese sites which share the same basaltic geology.

30|$|In Chepareria, {{enclosures}} {{were established}} to provide dry-season grazing reserves (Makokha et al. 1999; Kitalyi et al. 2002). Initially, enclosures were only used as dry-season fodder reserves while livestock were grazed {{in the open}} range during the rainy season. However, the continuous establishment of enclosures in Chepareria has reduced the available communal land, hence restricting livestock <b>grazing</b> within individual <b>enclosures</b> only. With reduced communal and individual land holdings, the need to diversify and complement sources of household livelihood, particularly from land use among enclosure owners, is gaining momentum. While the dominance of livestock-based management regimes in our study reaffirms previous studies which report that enclosures in African rangelands were mainly established for livestock grazing (Gaani et al. 2002; Nedessa et al. 2005; Napier and Desta 2011), we have also observed agricultural diversification of land use among enclosure owners to include crop cultivation, contractual grazing and fodder/grass seed production.|$|R
30|$|Variations {{observed}} {{across the}} {{locations in the}} adoption of the <b>grazing</b> and cultivation <b>enclosure</b> management system can be attributed to climatic differences across the study area. Morpus and Chepkopegh locations are in the drier, low altitude regions of Chepareria (Agroecological Zone (AEZ V), while Ywalateke location which is on the lower slopes of Kamatira hills is in AEZ IV. Climate variability and rainfall unpredictability impede crop cultivation within the study area, except in Ywalateke which is humid and receives more rainfall. The grazing and cultivation management regime is practised by more enclosure owners in the drier locations of Chepareria, namely Chepkopegh (66.7  %) and Morpus (76.7  %), as indicated in Table  2. The dominance of this enclosure regime in the drier areas of Chepareria is supported by previous studies which have observed that well-managed livestock production is more adapted and economically and environmentally efficient in drylands (Neely et al. 2009). It also requires limited capital investment (Kandagor 2005). In Ywalateke, the stable climate and higher rainfall in the mixed farming livelihood zone (Fig.  2) enables individuals to engage in intensive livestock- and crop-based regimes; hence, it is only practised by 30  % of Ywalateke residents.|$|R
30|$|Over {{the last}} three decades, the Njemps Flats of Baringo County in Kenya {{have been known to}} produce fodder and grass seeds. This has been in an effort to address declining pasture and {{livestock}} productivity {{as a result of a}} changing vegetation structure, declining diversity and increasing soil erosion attributed to increases in human and livestock populations (Wasonga et al. 2011). In the County, fodder is grown by agro-pastoral communities organized in groups as well as individuals who mainly plant the African foxtail grass (Cenchrus ciliaris) in enclosures meant to keep off <b>grazing</b> animals. The <b>enclosures</b> provide fodder banks for the owners’ herds during the dry periods, feedlots for fattening livestock for sale and fodder and grass seed for sale to other farmers for income (KRDP/ASAL DM 2012; Meyerhoff 2012; Channer 2013; Odunga 2013). Communal pasture development has been embraced by pastoral communities in the same county, with promising benefits. Households produce more milk leading to improved nutrition and food security among the households engaging in fodder production. Furthermore, fodder availability throughout the year, even during drought periods, has lessened conflicts over grazing that were previously rampant (Meyerhoff 2012).|$|R

40|$|Introduction:Changes {{caused by}} grazing on range {{ecosystem}} are generally assessed {{based on the}} soil conditions and vegetation. Livestock {{as one of the}} major elements in range land ecosystems has different effects on different parts of this ecosystem. One of these impacts is excessive livestock grazing capacity which can have different effects on soils and plants in various intensities. Materials and Methods:Gardaneh ZanbooriRangelandis located in Arsanjan in Fars province. This isanareaof mountains, hillsandplains with the maximum height of 2280 meters and minimum height of 1640 meters above sea level. Related areas were separated under three different management methods of <b>enclosure,</b> moderate <b>grazing</b> and heavy grazing. These three areas are considered as symbolic areas of grazing intensity including the reference area where no grazing intensity was observed, the key area where medium to heavy grazing was applied and critical area where heavy grazing was used. These areas were similar in all characteristics such as topography, soil type and rainfall and differed only in their grazing intensity factor. Then, soil samples were collected. Random systematic soil sampling was conducted at two horizons of 0 - 15 and 15 - 30 cm. Therefore, five profiles in each area (<b>enclosure,</b> moderate <b>grazing</b> and heavy grazing), a total of 15 soil profiles, were excavated and two samples were taken in each profile (one sample from each horizon). Finally, the thirty soil samples were transported to the laboratory. Samples were dried in the air laboratory and passed a two millimeter sieve after smashing. Factors such as N, P, K, OM, EC and PH were measured in each sample In the laboratory, the percentage of P was determined by the Olsen method while the percentage of K was determined using the flamephotometry method. Moreover, N was measured using the Kjeldhal method. C was measured by the Walkley and Black method. The percentage of OM was found by carbon multiplying percentage at 1. 72 numbers. PH was determined with measuring the PH of saturated soil by PH meter machine. Measurement of soil EC was performed by the electrical conductivity meter. Data analysis was conducted by SPSS software. Comparing of mean values for each factor and between areas with different grazing intensity was done by the Tukey test. Results and Discussion: Two-way analysis of variance and Tukey test showed no significant differences in term of N, OM and PH between critical and reference areas. But the amount of N and OM in the key area is lower than that of the reference and critical areas. While value of PH is higher than the other regions. Also values of P and K decreased within creasing grazing intensity but the EC factor increased. Conclusion: Since vegetation removal and its exclusion from the ecosystem followed by considerable effect on the cycle of nutrient elements and their absorbability, it seems that in the studied ranges, the P and K elements decrease through the use and leaving of vegetation in the area. The results of N and OM showed that moderate grazing causes further decomposition of plant residues and organic nitrogen mineralization but {{there was no difference between}} the two treatments of heavy <b>grazing</b> and <b>enclosure</b> areas. In heavy grazing intensity, the amount of OM and N increases by several mechanisms. First, with soil bulk density and increased soil compaction, the oxygen supply and degradation rate decreases. In the second mechanism, intensive grazing changes the vegetation composition and root to shoot ratio. In the third mechanism, animal urine and feces can speed up the nitrogen cycle in grassland ecosystems. It seems that the simultaneous effect of the above factors studied in the related range causes no significant difference between heavy <b>grazing</b> and <b>enclosure</b> areas in the percentage of total nitrogen. EC is the lowest in the enclosure area. This is due to the absence of livestock and therefore no stepping on the soil and also more vegetation. The PH level of enclosure area is less than that of the moderate grazing area. This may be caused by more presence of organic matter in the soil of enclosure. When organic matter decomposes, organic acid and mineral acids are produced. Permanent production of acids in the soil in places where the root density is high causes dissolution of limestone and the soil is washed and so it reduces the PH...|$|R

30|$|Traditionally, the Pokot are a {{pastoralist}} and semi-nomadic community, {{and it was}} - and in certain, {{more remote}} parts of West Pokot still is - common to migrate with the animals {{across the border into}} Uganda in search of pasture. The men left with the satellite herd, and during these periods, women were left tending for the children and looking after the nucleus herd. They also cultivated sorghum and millet on small plots. Today, the Cheparerian community is predominantly agro–pastoral,practising livestock-keeping and rain-fed agriculture (Awino Ochieng and Karmebäck 2014 b). Increasing population pressure, drought and insecurity augmented by government policies favouring sedentary lifestyles (land and social developments) confined and restricted pastoral mobility. With the establishment of enclosures, individuals owned and could properly manage the land. Results were recorded to be increased pastures availability, dry season grazing reserves and more reproductive and healthier animals for enclosure owners (Makokha et al. 1999). Consequently, as more individuals enclosed land, there was reduced pastoral migration (Makokha et al. 1999). Men were therefore free of their traditional role of herding, as animals only needed to be left to <b>graze</b> in the <b>enclosure,</b> taken to the river and back. Women on the other hand had more animals to milk, more productive land to tend and school-going children to attend to in addition to their domestic tasks. Overall - as this article will show - participation, decision-making and tasks of both men and women in Chepareria have changed over the years with these developments.|$|R

40|$|Context: Spatially {{heterogeneous}} habitats often promote {{woody plant}} species and functional diversity (FD). Ungulate herbivory {{can have the}} opposite effect. Across the globe, the type and intensity of herbivory is changing, as domestic livestock replace wild ungulates, which are increasingly confined to protected areas. Despite recognition {{of the importance of}} FD for ecosystem functioning, the interactive effect of soil-related fine-scale heterogeneity and larger-scale ungulate herbivory on woody plant FD is little-known. Objectives: In miombo woodland of Zimbabwe, we investigated (1) how bottom-up fine-scale heterogeneity created by Macrotermes termitaria interacts with top-down effects of herbivore foraging-guilds on woody plant FD; and (2) whether browsing combined with grazing impacts FD more than grazing alone. Methods: The three different herbivore treatments (grazing, combined browsing-and-grazing, and exclusion) had been maintained for 50 years. We surveyed 10 termite mound-matrix plots within three sites per treatment. We assessed woody plant traits and FD across treatments (herbivore feeding-guild) and position (mound or woodland-matrix), and interactive effects between these. Results: Woody plant FD was greater on mounds, and lowest overall with browsing-and-grazing. Specific traits were associated with position (e. g. palatability was greater for mounds), and treatment (e. g. spinescence increased with <b>grazing).</b> Conclusions: Long-term <b>enclosure</b> of ungulate herbivores (browsing-and-grazing, and grazing alone) decreased woody FD, but this was mitigated by termitaria. The novel finding is that at regional scales, mounds can enhance woody plant FD despite the impacts of herbivory. At broader scales encompassing the miombo system, potential exists for mounds to stabilise woody plant FD from livestock-induced impacts...|$|R
40|$|We {{conducted}} a survey on the causes of moose (Alces alces) deaths at 19 European moose facilities. The age at death was recorded for 205 moose, {{and the cause of}} death for 131 adult animals. The "wasting syndrome complex" (WSC) [Shochat et al., 1997] was the single most important mortality factor in adult animals, being responsible for 47 % of all cases. Other important factors were intraspecific aggression (13 %) and malignant catarrhal fever (12 %). The number of deaths showed a peak at the age of 6 - 8 years. A similar peak was found in the age distribution of WSC cases only, suggesting an accumulative process that leads to the death of an animal once a threshold is reached. While the dominance of WSC is in accord with the American literature, the high incidence of intraspecific aggression found in this and other European surveys is not reported in North America. While in the North American literature the consumption of grass and grass products is regarded as the main factor triggering WSC, infection with whipworms (Trichuris spp.) and continuous reinfection through pasture grazing is emphasized as the main danger in Europe. Most reports of WSC in the literature concern animals that <b>grazed</b> in pasture-like <b>enclosures.</b> In no case was WSC triggered by controlled feeding of freshly cut grass fed to animals in holding pens. In our survey, in half of all documented WSC cases Trichuris infestation was reported as well. With a high proportion of incomplete necropsies in our data set, we suggest that the contribution of Trichuris to the problems of moose husbandry has been underestimated...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} {{whether the}} change in migration pattern was linked to forage availability and considered two mechanisms by which the forage resource on Victoria Island may have been compromised. Examination of remote-sensed NDVI, an index of the biomass of vegetation in an area, at a landscape scale demonstrated that the mainland provides caribou with higher vegetation quantity. Other factors may also influence the ranging behaviour of individuals, for example the range shift also led to changes in diet, and thus quality of forage. At {{the time of the}} wintering range shift, the populations of both caribou and the sympatric Arctic ruminant, muskox (Ovibos moschatus), were found to be increasing on Victoria Island. Availability of forage was therefore potentially decreasing, in particular due to the muskox who are resident on the south of the Island throughout the year. The impact of grazing on vegetation in different seasons was examined by carrying out an <b>enclosure</b> <b>grazing</b> experiment. Summer grazing by muskox significantly reduced vegetation biomass in areas likely to be used by caribou during the winter. Therefore the availability of wintering forage may have been reduced by increase in temporally separated forage competition, possibly stimulating the range shift. In addition to forage availability being directly impacted by grazing, the resource can also be indirectly affected by parasites. Food-borne parasites, such as gastrointestinal nematodes, may reduce nutrient assimilation, whilst other more active parasites, such as oestrid flies, may reduce feeding time and energy storage through harassing their hosts. The potential for increasing parasite burdens decreases the benefits of foraging in a particular area. High burdens of both these parasite groups were related to poor condition, as indicated by weight and reproductive state, in the Dolphin-Union caribou.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in 2006 / 07 in Metema district, North Gondar Zone of Amhara region, Ethiopia, with the objectives to characterize the existing rangeland and to determine the feed resources utilization practices, to assess the natural grazing land condition based on herbaceous, woody and soil condition and to evaluate the chemical composition of major livestock feed resources of the area. A single-visit formal survey, group discussions and visual observations are used to collect the primary information and secondary sources are also used in livestock feed resources assessment of the district. A total of 140 respondents from 7 kebeles were selected for interviewing by stratified random sampling techniques. To assess the range conditions, the samples were collected by classifying the district into cotton–livestock and sesame–livestock farming systems. Within a farming system, grazing lands were further stratified into three sampling areas: communal, road side and <b>enclosure</b> <b>grazing</b> areas. In each of the range sites a sampling block of 4 km × 1 km was demarcated and this was further stratified into four sampling plots of equal size. In each of the plot, a belt transects of 50 m × 4 m was laid out randomly. Then, the parameter used for (herbaceous, soil and woody) grass species composition, basal cover, litter cover, soil erosion, soil compaction, seedling count, age distribution and woody density enumeration, canopy cover and hedging were determined. For the height classes 1 – 3 m, > 3 – 4. 5 m and > 4. 5 m was used. Feed samples were stratified by season and types and subjected to chemical analysis for determination of DM, ash, CP, ADF, ADL and IVDMD. About 83 % of the inhabitants in the district practice mixed crop–livestock farming system. The mean family size is 5. 31 ± 0. 20 persons per household, while the average land holding is 6. 78 ± 1. 33 ha/household. The mean livestock holding per household is 12. 52 ± 6. 23 TLU, and is composed of cattle, goats, sheep, donkeys and camels. Natural pasture (55. 7 %), crop residues (20. 7 %), stubble (14. 3 %) and hay (9. 3 %) are the major feed resources for dry season whereas in the wet season only natural pasture serves as feed resource. The total estimated DM yield of grazing land and stubble is 780, 750 and 51, 954 t DM per annum, respectively. The total estimated available feed supply is 833, 531. 2 t DM per annum. Of the identified 33 herbaceous species, 14 and 19 are different grasses and non-grass species. From the non-grass species 6 legumes and 13 sedges and other species are recorded. Of the grasses, 23. 07 %, 38. 46 % and 30. 77 % are highly desirable, desirable and less desirable, respectively. Of the identified 20 woody species, 15 %, 35 %, and 50 % are highly desirable, desirable and less desirable, respectively. The largest proportion of woody vegetation is contributed by different species of acacia (20 %) and commbretum (10 %). Trees and shrubs grouped within the height class of > 1 – 3 m constituted 41. 2 % in communal grazing areas, 38. 5 % in road side grazing and 33. 3 % in enclosures. Range condition assessment factors such as basal cover, litter cover, grass species composition, woody vegetation density, canopy cover, hedging effect, age distribution and total condition score are significant (P< 0. 05) in communal grazing areas of the sesame–livestock than in the cotton–livestock farming system. The communal grazing areas have significantly (P< 0. 05) higher values of grass species composition, basal cover, litter cover, age distribution, and woody species density score, than the road side grazing areas and lower (P< 0. 05) than the <b>enclosure</b> <b>grazing</b> areas. The dry matter biomass of grass, highly desirable, desirable species of grasses and legumes and others obtained in the same farming system were significantly (P< 0. 05) higher than the road side grazing types and lower (P< 0. 05) in total grass biomass, highly desirable grass, and total biomass than enclosure areas. The total dry matter biomass, dry matter biomass of grass and highly desirable grasses, and legumes are significantly (P< 0. 05) higher in the enclosure followed by communal grazing and the road side grazing areas. In general, there is low feed resources conservation and utilization and very poor traditional grazing land management system in Metema. The abundant feed resources in the wet season are wasted. In the dry season, grasses are turned to ash by wild and man-made fire in the process of forest honey harvesting and crop land cleaning. As a result, the livestock populations seriously suffer from the critical feed shortage during the long dry season. The rangeland, species composition and biomass production are also affected by human, livestock and natural factors (biotic and abiotic factors). The human population of the district has increased due to settlement programs, investment induced settlers, expanding crop cultivation and have increased the pressure on the rangelands and natural grazing areas. Bush encroachment and overgrazing are also serious problems. Shifting cultivation practice is also contributing to the increased bush encroachment. The seasonal movement and transhumant livestock production by highlanders in adjacent districts also increases the grazing intensity. Absence of adequate baseline information about the rangeland resources, unsynchronized seasonal availability of feed resources and cropland encroachment to the rangeland are some of the main constraints of the district, and studies on rangeland management systems and improved livestock production should be initiated.

40|$|Wistman's Wood is one {{of three}} small oakwoods growing in {{isolated}} positions amongst granite blocks (clitter) on steep slopes at > 250 m altitude on Dartmoor, an upland area of moorland in south-west England (Barkham, 1978). The aim {{of this study was to}} (1) reveal the long-temn pattern of regeneration and woodland expansion at Wistman's Wood, (2) investigate the effects a 40 year old enclosure inside the woodland has had on its structure, and (3) uncover the ecological history and conservation status of the stand. Successful natural regeneration throughout Wistman's Wood appears to have been continuous for 100 years (1886 - 1985) but particularly successful during 1926 - 1965. After 1985, an almost complete lack of regeneration was observed across all sites outside the <b>enclosure.</b> <b>Grazing</b> has probably been the main factor determining success or failure in regeneration but growth rate has also played a part. Significant differences in the long-term recruitment and woodland structure inside the enclosure were observed: a much higher proportion of the sampled trees inside the enclosure had been released after enclosure and this site displayed the highest tree density with mean tree crowding 17 % to 76 % higher than that of the other 3 sites open to grazing. Leaf are index (LAI) was also found to be highest inside the enclosure. All of the above indicates that regeneration has been much more successful inside the enclosure than at sites open to grazing and has remained so until the present time. Wistman's Wood stand structure has been dramatically changed after this wave of regeneration. It has increased its woodland area by 106 %, the canopy has risen in height and infilled, and the growth form of the trees has altered. Today, the wood consists of a mosaic in which the South and Middle groves display an uneven-aged structure with most trees within the younger class ages but with a distinct lack of seedlings and saplings. The enclosure also displays an unevenaged structure but with mean age here significantly lower than that of the two groves. In contrast, an even-aged stand structure can be observed at the regeneration site. This site is the result of recent regeneration and expansion and could be considered as a single demographic unit. Tree mortality at these last two sites is high and could be attributed to self-thinning. Monitoring of the effects of grazing and canopy structure on present and future regeneration within the groves is required in order to ensure a sustained woodland canopy.
