500|$|In {{part due}} to its dual printing, [...] "The Raven" [...] made Edgar Allan Poe a {{household}} name almost immediately, and turned Poe into a national celebrity. Readers began to identify poem with poet, earning Poe the nickname [...] "The Raven". The poem was soon widely reprinted, imitated, and parodied. Though it made Poe popular in his day, it did not bring him significant financial success. As he later lamented, [...] "I have made no money. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>as</b> poor now as ever I was in my life—except in hope, which {{is by no means}} bankable".|$|E

It's the spirit of who <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> <b>as</b> a man, an actor, a father. It's where I come from." [...] Brosnan was asked by a fan if it annoyed him when people get his nationality confused. He said: [...] "It amuses me in some respects that they should confuse me with an Englishman when I'm dyed-in-the-wool, born and bred Irishman... I don't necessarily fly under any flag. But no, it doesn't bother me." ...|$|E
500|$|After Readys success, Songz {{explained}} that the album {{was a result of}} his growth and new-found maturity. Commenting about the success of his singles, Songz stated that [...] "they're very strong records and they're not just radio records. They're records that embody the person <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>as</b> well as the artist I am. I think they're more definitive of who I am than any other album I've had. I've grown as an artist.

500|$|In early 1911, Mertz went to London to {{meet with}} the Australian {{geologist}} and explorer Douglas Mawson. Mawson, who had served as physicist during Ernest Shackleton's 1908–09 Nimrod Expedition, was planning his own Antarctic expedition. In his application letter, Mertz wrote that he hoped Mawson would be using skis, as [...] "they have proved so good for the purpose & knowing that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>as</b> good as any one on skys." [...] While Mawson was intending to recruit only British subjects (chiefly Australians and New Zealanders), Mertz's qualifications prompted him to make an exception, and hire the Swiss as a ski instructor. First, however, he was given responsibility for the expedition's 49Greenland Huskies, aboard the expedition ship SY Aurora, bound for Hobart.|$|E
500|$|Hobart {{was more}} {{assertive}} as Senate president than his predecessors had been. [...] It was customary {{for the vice}} president not to rule on disputed points, but to submit them to a vote. [...] Hobart, with his experience as a presiding officer in the New Jersey Legislature, took a more assertive role, ruling on disputes, and trying to expedite legislation. [...] Hobart was initially diffident in his role, feeling himself unproven beside longtime national legislators, but soon gained self-confidence, writing in a letter that [...] "I find that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>as</b> good and as capable as any of them. [...] If they know a whole lot of things I don't know, I also know a whole lot of things they don't know. And there is a common humanity running through them all that makes us all as one, after all." [...] Hobart was so successful at guiding the administration's legislative agenda through the Senate that he became known as the [...] "assistant President".|$|E

500|$|In 2012, in an interview, Pusha T {{spoke on}} the {{inspiration}} behind the album title. [...] "Basically, I tried to pick a title that embodied who <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>as</b> an artist. I wanted people to understand like Pusha is everything that I really, really am. Actually, there is a line in 'Pain' where I say [...] "My name is my name," [...] that line comes from Marlo Stanfield from the series The Wire. It {{was one of the}} more prominent catch phrases that he said {{at the end of that}} series. He was basically saying, I am who I am, I stand on my name I live this. I really felt that embodied my presence in the rap game." [...] Pusha T announced the new title of his album in November 2012, along with Spin reporting that his album had been pushed back until 2013. On March 19, 2013 Pusha T said that the album would include 13 songs and that he had already finished 11 of those songs.|$|E
500|$|Mauboy {{performed}} at the ICC Cricket World Cup opening ceremony held on 12 February 2015 at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl in Melbourne. On 3 May 2015, she appeared on the US Today show in a segment that was filmed live at the Sydney Opera House with host Savannah Guthrie. In {{an interview with the}} Australian Associated Press that same month, Mauboy revealed that she had already begun writing songs for her upcoming fourth studio album. She said, [...] "This time around with the album I would like to...just take risks in terms of the sound and identifying who <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>as</b> a woman. It's more of a rhythmic pop so it's not going to be extreme pop. It's {{going to be a little}} bit more soul." [...] The album's lead single [...] "This Ain't Love" [...] was released in September 2015; it peaked at number five and was certified gold. Mauboy along with The Veronicas and Tina Arena performed Arena's 1994 single [...] "Chains" [...] at the 2015 ARIA Music Awards, where Arena was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame. Their version was released as a single following the performance, and peaked at number 14.|$|E
500|$|Next {{to appear}} on the stand was Virtue Hall, who recounted much of her earlier {{statement}} to Fielding. [...] Squires again interrupted, asking [...] "What day was it that the young woman was robbed?" [...] The answer came back, from the court: [...] "She says {{on the morning of the}} 2nd of January", and Squires replied [...] "I return thanks for telling me, for <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>as</b> innocent as the child unborn". [...] Susannah Wells used the opportunity to ask how long Squires and her family were supposed to have been at the house, and was answered by Hall [...] "They were there six or seven weeks in all; they had been there about a fortnight before the young woman was brought in". [...] Amongst others, Thomas Colley and Mrs Canning also gave testimony. [...] Canning's former employer, John Wintlebury, told the court how he had deduced that it was Wells's house where Canning had been held. [...] Mary Myers and James Lord also claimed to have heard Canning say [...] "Wills or Wells", as did Robert Scarrat, a hartshorn-rasper and previously a servant in nearby Edmonton who had visited Wells's house on previous occasions.|$|E

500|$|Stephen Crane's {{fiction is}} {{typically}} categorized {{as representative of}} Naturalism, American realism, Impressionism or a mixture of the three. [...] Critic Sergio Perosa, for example, wrote in his essay, [...] "Stephen Crane fra naturalismo e impressionismo," [...] that the work presents a [...] "symbiosis" [...] of Naturalistic ideals and Impressionistic methods. [...] When asked {{whether or not he}} would write an autobiography in 1896, Crane responded that he [...] "dare not say that I am honest. [...] I merely say that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>as</b> nearly honest as a weak mental machinery will allow." [...] Similarities between the stylistic techniques in Crane's writing and Impressionist painting—including the use of color and chiaroscuro—are often cited to support the theory that Crane was not only an Impressionist but also influenced by the movement. [...] H. G. Wells remarked upon [...] "the great influence of the studio" [...] on Crane's work, quoting a passage from The Red Badge of Courage as an example: [...] "At nightfall the column broke into regimental pieces, and the fragments went into the fields to camp. Tents sprang up like strange plants. Camp fires, like red, peculiar blossoms, dotted the night.... From this little distance the many fires, with the black forms of men passing to and fro before the crimson rays, made weird and satanic effects." [...] Although no direct evidence exists that Crane formulated a precise theory of his craft, he vehemently rejected sentimentality, asserting that [...] "a story should be logical in its action and faithful to character. [...] Truth to life itself was the only test, the greatest artists were the simplest, and simple because they were true." ...|$|E
500|$|Hamasaki's {{influence}} {{goes beyond}} music; she is often considered a fashion icon and trend-setter, a status attributed to her tight control over her image. Besides her frequent appearances in fashion magazines, such as Vivi, Popteen, and Cawaii!, Hamasaki {{has often been}} lauded for her trendy choices in apparels and accessories; Oricon has repeatedly named her the [...] "Most Fashionable Female Artist". Many aspects of Japan's fashions—including clothing, hair, nails, and accessories—have in some way been influenced by her. As with her music, trends Hamasaki started have spread to Asian countries as Taiwan, China, and Singapore. Among the trends Hamasaki has started is hime-kei (a look inspired by the fashions of 18th century French aristocracy); she has also heavily influenced the kogal subculture. Hamasaki's constantly changing image is apparent not only in her fashion photo shoots and commercial endorsements but also in her record covers, an element she considers essential in conveying her message. She has portrayed herself as a vine-clad [...] "peace muse" [...] or [...] "Greek goddess" [...] (on her album <b>I</b> <b>Am...),</b> <b>as</b> a [...] "twenty-first-century Joan of Arc" [...] (for her single [...] "Free & Easy"), and as a [...] "funky Lolita". Though Hamasaki has portrayed herself in earlier releases as a [...] "girl next door", she has adopted a more sexualized image since the release of Loveppears. The covers for records including Loveppears, I Am..., Rainbow, and Party Queen feature Hamasaki in states of partial nudity, for which she has generated controversy. Hamasaki also garnered criticism after she modeled bra for lingerie manufacturer Wacoal, {{though most of the}} criticism alleged that Hamasaki was only trying to [...] "play catch-up" [...] with Kumi Koda, who gained popularity for her overtly sexual image.|$|E
500|$|In September 2000, {{she joined}} the ABT Studio Company, which is ABT's second company, and {{became a member of}} its Corps de ballet in 2001. As part of the Studio Company, she {{performed}} the Pas de Deux in Tchaikovsky's The Sleeping Beauty. Eight months after joining the company, she was sidelined for nearly a year by a lumbar stress fracture. When Copeland joined the company, she weighed [...] (she is [...] tall). At age 19, her puberty had been delayed, a situation common in ballet dancers. After the lumbar fracture, her doctor told her that inducing puberty would help to strengthen her bones, and he prescribed birth control pills. Copeland recalls that in one month she gained 10 pounds, and her small breasts swelled to double D-cup size: [...] "Leotards had to be altered for me ... to cover my cleavage, for instance. I hated this sign that I was different from the others. ... I became so self-conscious that, {{for the first time in}} my life, I couldn’t dance strong. I was too busy trying to hide my breasts." [...] Management noticed and called her in to talk about her body. The professional pressure to conform to conventional ballet aesthetics resulted in body image struggles and a binge eating disorder. Copeland says that, over the next year, new friendships outside of ABT, including with Victoria Rowell and her boyfriend, Olu Evans, helped her to regain confidence in her body. She explained, [...] "My curves became an integral part of who <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>as</b> a dancer, not something I needed to lose to become one. I started dancing with confidence and joy, and soon the staff at ABT began giving me positive feedback again. And I think I changed everyone’s mind about what a perfect dancer is supposed to look like." [...] During her years in the corps, as the only Black woman in the company, Copeland also felt the burden of her ethnicity in many ways and contemplated a variety of career choices. Recognizing that Copeland's isolation and self-doubt were standing in the way of her talent, ABT's artistic director, Kevin McKenzie, asked writer and arts figure Susan Fales-Hill, then vice-chair of ABT's Board of Directors, to mentor Copeland. Fales-Hill introduced Copeland to Black women trailblazers who encouraged Copeland and helped her to gain perspective.|$|E
