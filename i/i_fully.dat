500|$|Several {{additional}} hypotheses {{have been}} proposed to improve upon and reconcile the LDR and BDR hypotheses. One predominantly favored hypothesis, first developed by Günter P. Wagner and Jacques Gauthier in 1999, involves a [...] "frameshift" [...] of the digits; the first digit fails {{to grow in the}} first developmental site due to not receiving the necessary signals, which has the effect of shifting digits I-III to the positions of II-IV. Thus, while digits I-III from the ancestral theropod are retained, they do not grow in the same location. A version of the frameshift hypothesis modified to incorporate both elements of BDR and fossil evidence from Limusaurus and other theropods, the [...] "thumbs down" [...] hypothesis of Capek et al., suggests that this frameshift took place after the reduction of both the first and the fourth digits in the theropod lineage. The major alternative hypothesis supported by Xu Xing et al., known as the [...] "lateral shift hypothesis", considers a partial, step-wise frameshift in which, from a four-fingered hand with reduced digits I and IV, <b>I</b> <b>fully</b> disappears while IV develops into a fully-fledged finger, with II-IV taking on the morphologies of the former I-III.|$|E
