40|$|The {{enantioselective}} titanium(IV) -catalyzed cyanobenzoylation of aldehydes using 1 : 1 BINOLAM/Ti(OiPr) 4 mixtures as a precatalyst gave O-aroyl cyanohydrins 4 {{with good}} enantiomeric excesses. The standard optimization set {{carried out on}} the assumption of Curtin–Hammett behavior, led to no amelioration. Extensive experimental and computational {{studies were carried out}} with the purpose of identifying the key mechanistic aspects governing enantioselectivity. HCN and <b>isopropyl</b> <b>benzoate</b> were detected in the reacting mixtures. This as well as the reaction response to the presence of an exogenous base, and the failure to react in the presence of Binol/Ti(OiPr) 4 mixtures, led us to propose, not a direct but an indirect process involving an enantioselective hydrocyanation step followed by O-benzoylation. Computational work carried out with mononuclear monomeric MM and dinuclear mixed dimer DlMD as catalysts support this mechanistic proposal. On the other hand, cyanobenzoylations carried out with 1 : 2 or higher 1 :n (up to 1 : 5) BINOLAM/Ti(OiPr) 4 mixtures appear to involve a reversal of the enantioselection. This, together {{with the fact that the}} benzoylation of the ligated iPrOH is a slow reaction, has led us to conclude that these cyanobenzoylations do not fit within the standard Curtin–Hammett kinetic scheme. Instead, such BINOLAM/Ti(OiPr) 4 -catalyzed cyanobenzoylations of aldehydes rather behave as non-Curtin–Hammett kinetic schemes. Further computational analysis is needed in order to make a clear distinction between Curtin–Hammett and non-Curtin–Hammett kinetic frameworks.

40|$|Extensive {{experimental}} and computational {{studies have been}} carried out on the enantioselective titanium(IV) -catalyzed cyanobenzoylation of aldehydes using 1 :n Binolam:Ti(OiPr) 4 mixtures as precatalysts, with the purpose of identifying the key mechanistic aspects governing enantioselectivity. HCN and <b>isopropyl</b> <b>benzoate</b> were detected in the reacting mixtures. This, as well as the reaction’s response to the presence of an exogenous base, and the failure to react in the presence of Binol:Ti(OiPr) 4 mixtures, led us to propose not a direct cyanobenzoylation but an indirect process involving enantioselective hydrocyanation followed by O-benzoylation. Computational work provided positive evidence for the intervention of both indirect and direct cyanobenzoylation routes, the former being faster. However, the standard Curtin–Hammett-based optimization search ended with unsatisfactory results. Experimental and computational DFT studies (B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G*) led us to conclude that: (1) the overall cyanobenzoylation of aldehydes catalyzed by 1 :n Binolam:Ti(OiPr) 4 mixtures involves an enantioselective hydrocyanation followed by an stereochemically inert O-benzoylation; (2) the initial complexes prevailing in a 1 : 1 Binolam:Ti(OiPr) 4 mixture are the solvated mononuclear monomer 5 · 2 (iPrOH) and solvated dinuclear dimer 9 · 2 (iPrOH), whereas 9 · 2 (iPrOH) is the major component in a 1 : 2 or higher 1 :n mixture; (3) since the slowest step is that of benzoylation of ligated iPrOH which yields the actual catalysts 5 – 9, the catalytic system fits into a non-Curtin–Hammett framework, the final products deriving from a kinetic quench of the competing routes; and (4) accordingly, catalysis by 1 : 1 Binolam:Ti(OiPr) 4 mixtures should involve cyanobenzoylations promoted by mononuclear 5, contaminated with those promoted by some dinuclear open dimer 9, whereas cyanobenzoylations catalyzed by a 1 : 2 and higher 1 :n mixtures should be the result of catalysis promoted by the large amounts of dinuclear open dimer 9.
