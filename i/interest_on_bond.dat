40|$|How {{to account}} for <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> <b>bonds</b> in a system as {{integrated}} as the System of National Accounts 1993 (1993 SNA) {{has been a source}} of much controversy. Two main positions emerge: the debtor treatment based on the contractual arrangements of the bonds; and the creditor treatment based <b>on</b> current <b>interest</b> rates and prices of assets/liabilities. Using the discounted cash flow model, this paper explores the treatment of income and other benefits from assets in the 1993 SNA. It finds that the debtor approach to bond interest conforms with the 1993 SNA recording income and other benefits from assets, as that approach captures the results of effective decision making between institutional units.

40|$|In the United States, local {{government}} expenditures are heavily subsidized {{through a variety}} of sources.

Making <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> municipal <b>bonds</b> taxable, however, substantially hurts the very rich, who lose a tax shelter, and may hurt the very poor, who pay more for municipal services.
