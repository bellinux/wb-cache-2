40|$|Abstract. The {{palm fruit}} biomass is {{introduced}} into the pyrolysis reactor bed and the transport equations for heat, mass and momentum transfer are solved using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique. The Eulerian-Eulerian approach is employed to model fluidizing behavior of the sand for an <b>externally</b> <b>heated</b> <b>reactor</b> prior {{to the introduction of}} the biomass. The particle motion in the reactor is computed using the drag laws which depend on the local volume fraction of each phase. Heat transfer from the fluidized bed to the biomass particles together with the pyrolysis reactions were simulated by Fluent CFD code through user-defined function (UDF). Spontaneous production of pyrolysis oil, char and non-condensable gases (NCG) confirm the observation widely reported in literature. The computer model can potentially be used to assess other candidate biomass sources also to assist design of optimized pyrolysis reactors...|$|E
40|$|The {{combustion}} {{of fossil}} fuel (e. g. coal, oil, wood) produces gaseous pollutants (e. g. nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons) and {{a multitude of}} submicron carbon particles and particles on the micrometer scale (soot) simultaneously. In general, the number of nanoparticles per cubic metre exhaust predominate the number of particles in the micrometer range clearly. For example, modern diesel engines emit a few 10 000 soot particles per cm 3 exhaust of size above several 100 nm compared to up to 107 carbon particles in the range between 10 and 200 nm. One promising approach to eliminate the soot particles in the submicron range from engine exhaust is the usage of a catalytic coated electrically heatable SiC-filter following the so- called Jülicher concept. This work {{is the first step}} in the development of such an filter. Several catalysts were investigated. They were chosen because of their anticipated applicability. A laboratory reactor was therefore developed with an <b>externally</b> <b>heated</b> <b>reactor</b> tube and a model soot generator. The model soot was produced with an spark discharge generator in a nitrogen carrier gas stream. After adding an oxidation media (oxygen or nitrogendioxide), the aerosol was fed into the reactor, which contains the catalyst coated onto alumina oxide spheres with 1. 5 to 1. 7 mm in diameter. The oxidation product was recorded in dependence of the granular bed temperature. Furthermore the particle phase was mainly measured before and behind the reactor with a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS) and a Photoelectric Aerosol Sensor (PAS). The contact between soot particles and the catalyst was investigated with the before mentioned equipment taking a theoretical determination of the particle deposition on the catalyst bed based on the Happel-Model into account. The theoretical model includes the deposition mechanisms: particle diffusion, interception, impaction, gravitational settling and thermophoresis together with the mechanisms of tempering and thermal coagulation (agglomeration), which both affect the morphology of the particles. A good agreement between calculation and measurement was achieved with deviations of +/- 20 % at the most. Investigations of the catalytic particle oxidation with oxygen pointed out that precious metal as well as non-precious metal catalysts show a significant activity below 200 °C. A two-step oxidation process was observed during oxidation of the model soot and could be described with a double Arrhenius equation. The variation of the dwell time in the reactor mainly affected only the soot particle deposition in the granular bed and in conclusion the amount of particle mass accumulated under the chosen experimental conditions. An oxygen content of more than 10 vol. -% had no influence of the oxidation of the deposited particles, whereas a dependence on oxygen concentrations up to 20 vol. -% was observed concerning the transmitted particle phase above 625 °C. Compared with oxygen, the usage of nitrogendioxid as oxidation medium lowers the onset of the particle oxidation down to about 100 °C approximately. Furthermore a higher turnover was measured in the lower temperature region. Final tests with dry diesel soot and oxygen were performed to compare the diesel soot oxidation with the results obtained with the model soot. A two-step oxidation process with oxygen as oxidation medium was observed as well. The oxidation onset temperature increases by 75 °C at the most, when using the diesel soot in stead of the model soot...|$|E

The major oxygen-containing gaseous product was CO for the low-oxygen fuel, such as Fugu bituminous coal (FG), whereas this was mainly CO 2 for the oxygen-rich fuels, such as Shengli lignite (SL) and herb residue (HR). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were taken to analyze the evolution of five oxygen-containing functional groups. The C=O bond existing in ester and carboxyl/carbonyl groups is easy to decompose and is nearly eliminated at 600 degrees C.

40|$|Powders {{consisting}} of dense, nonagglomerated, roughly spherical particles with a controlled size distribution {{are thought to}} be ideal for engineering applications of ceramic materials. The production of such powders in aerosol reactors is difficult due to the extreme difficulty of controlling particle formation by homogeneous nucleation of condensible vapors produced by gas phase chemical reactions. To generate the quality of powders necessary for engineering applications, one needs to understand the processes governing particle formation and growth in aerosol reactors. Homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation were studied in a laminar flow aerosol generator using dibutylphthalate vapor. Seed particles were found to suppress homogeneous nucleation to an extent depending on their concentration. With additional insights on nucleation and nucleation suppression, aerosol physics was applied to an effort to generate dense, spherical silicon particles in a single stage multi-zone <b>externally</b> <b>heated</b> aerosol <b>reactor.</b> Subsequent experiments revealed that the dense silicon particles generated resulted from the sintering of aggregates formed by coagulation of like-sized particles. While the production of dense particles by sintering of low density agglomerates are feasible for low melting materials, it is not practical for refractory materials due to the high sintering temperatures required for complete coalescence in the available residence time. To produce ideal refractory powder materials, growth must be limited to vapor and small cluster deposition.

Experimental studies include both cold and hot flow evaluations of the following parameters: flame holder geometry, secondary air swirl, primary and secondary inlet air velocity, coal concentration in the primary air and coal particle size distribution. Hot flow experiments will also evaluate the effect of wall temperature on burner performance. Cold flow studies will be conducted with surrogate particles as well as pulverized coal.
