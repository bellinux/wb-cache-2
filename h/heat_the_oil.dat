2500|$|Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) is an {{enhanced}} oil recovery technology for producing {{heavy crude oil}} and bitumen.

2500|$|Based {{on these}} {{descriptions}} and the Byzantine sources, John Haldon and Maurice Byrne designed a hypothetical apparatus as consisting of three main components: a bronze pump, {{which was used}} to pressurize the oil; a brazier, used to <b>heat</b> <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> (πρόπυρον, propyron, [...] "pre-heater"); and the nozzle, which was covered in bronze and mounted on a swivel (στρεπτόν, strepton). The brazier, burning a match of linen or flax that produced intense heat and the characteristic thick smoke, was used to heat oil and the other ingredients in an airtight tank above it, a process that also helped to dissolve the resins into a fluid mixture. The substance was pressurized by {{the heat and the}} usage of a force pump. After it had reached the proper pressure, a valve connecting the tank with the swivel was opened and the mixture was discharged from its end, being ignited at its mouth by some source of flame. The intense heat of the flame made necessary the presence of heat shields made of iron (βουκόλια, boukolia), which are attested in the fleet inventories.|$|E

50|$|The 1 GWth {{project will}} {{reduce the amount of}} natural gas used to {{generate}} steam for thermal enhanced oil recovery (EOR). In thermal EOR, steam is injected into an oil reservoir to <b>heat</b> <b>the</b> <b>oil,</b> making it easier to pump to the surface.

5000|$|Oils are [...] "blown" [...] through partial {{oxidation}} of <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> at elevated temperatures.

50|$|Oil {{from the}} field is treated onsite at a small {{processing}} facility on the Davis Lease, consisting of heaters, an oil-water separator, and storage tanks. Gas {{from the field}} is used as fuel onsite to <b>heat</b> <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> in the tanks and power the pumping units. Excess gas is flared; none leaves the site. Sulfur is scrubbed from the gas prior to use. Water separated from the oil is reinjected into the producing formation, where {{it serves as a}} flooding mechanism to assist in moving the heavy oil to production wells.|$|E
50|$|This method, {{also known}} as the Huff and Puff method, {{consists}} of 3 stages: injection, soaking, and production. Steam is first injected into a well for {{a certain amount of time}} to <b>heat</b> <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> in the surrounding reservoir to a recover approximately 20% of the Original Oil in Place (OOIP), compared to steam assisted gravity drainage, which has been reported to recover over 50% of OOIP. It is quite common for wells to be produced in the cyclic steam manner for a few cycles before being put on a steam flooding regime with other wells.|$|E
50|$|In a steam flood, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} a steam drive, some wells are used as steam injection wells and other wells are used for oil production. Two mechanisms are at work to improve the amount of oil recovered. The first is to <b>heat</b> <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> to higher temperatures and to thereby decrease its viscosity so that it more easily flows through the formation toward the producing wells. A second mechanism is the physical displacement employing {{in a manner similar}} to water flooding, in which oil is meant to be pushed to the production wells. While more steam is needed for this method than for the cyclic method, it is typically more effective at recovering a larger portion of the oil.|$|E
50|$|Head space {{extraction}} {{is explained}} in ASTM D 3612-C. The extraction of the gases {{is achieved by}} agitating and <b>heating</b> <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> to release <b>the</b> gases into a 'head space' of a sealed vial.

50|$|<b>The</b> {{dangers of}} <b>oil</b> or fat fires (generally {{flammable}} substances less dense than water) {{are well known}} in industrial processes. Attempts to extinguish oil fires with water result in a boilover: an extremely hazardous condition whereby <b>the</b> flaming <b>oil</b> is violently expelled from the container. These fires result from either <b>heating</b> <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> to its autoignition point or by <b>oil</b> splattering onto <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> source.|$|R
500|$|<b>Heating</b> <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> shale to {{pyrolysis}} {{temperature and}} completing the endothermic kerogen decomposition reactions require {{a source of}} energy. Some technologies burn other fossil fuels such as natural gas, oil, or coal to generate this heat and experimental methods have used electricity, radio waves, microwaves, or reactive fluids for this purpose. [...] Two strategies are used to reduce, and even eliminate, external <b>heat</b> energy requirements: <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> shale gas and char by-products generated by pyrolysis may be burned {{as a source of}} energy, and <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> contained in hot spent oil shale and oil shale ash may be used to pre-heat <b>the</b> raw <b>oil</b> shale.|$|R
50|$|Thermally {{enhanced}} oil recovery methods (TEOR) are tertiary recovery techniques that <b>heat</b> <b>the</b> <b>oil,</b> reducing its viscosity {{and making it}} easier to extract. Steam injection is {{the most common form of}} TEOR, and it is often done with a cogeneration plant. This type of cogeneration plant uses a gas turbine to generate electricity, and the waste heat is used to produce steam, which is then injected into the reservoir. This form of recovery is used extensively to increase oil extraction in the San Joaquin Valley, which yields a very heavy oil, yet accounts for ten percent of the United States' oil extraction. Fire flooding (In-situ burning) is another form of TEOR, but instead of steam, some of the oil is burned to heat the surrounding oil.|$|E

50|$|Enhanced oil {{recovery}} {{methods have been}} implemented in the Carabobo oil field to improve the low recovery factors. Along with microbial enhanced {{oil recovery}}, which involves using microorganisms as biosurfactants to reduce the viscosities of the extra heavy crudes, immiscible gas injection, polymer flooding, and in situ combustion, better known as fireflooding, have all been used to improve the recovery {{of oil in the}} field. The advancements in horizontal drilling techniques have led to the use of steam assisted gravity drainage in extra heavy oil reservoirs. Steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) involves drilling two holes, one above the oil and the other below. Steam is then injected into the upper hole, causing the steam to condense and <b>heat</b> <b>the</b> <b>oil.</b> The oil becomes less viscous, and drains into the hole below due to gravity. Using this method, recovery could be as high as 87%, which is a vast improvement over other methods in use for extraction of extra heavy crude oils.|$|E

50|$|In {{his memoir}} Minckelers {{tells us how}} he made his discovery: from the very {{beginning}} of his experiments he had had the idea of enclosing oil in the barrel of a gun and heating it in a forge. Under action of the <b>heat</b> <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> dissolved and gave way to a very light gas, having other advantageous qualities. Having proved that oil gas was the best for balloons, Minckelers used it for many balloons which rose rapidly and travelled great distances in the neighbourhood of Leuven. As we learn from his pupil von Hulstein, who was in his class in 1785, Minckelers at times used this same gas to light his workshop. Moreover, the drift of his memoir proves clearly that in its inventor's eyes the great combustibility of the gas was one of its leading qualities. When Joseph II, in 1788, transferred the Catholic University of Leuven to Brussels, Minckelers continued as professor, but when it was removed back to Leuven he refused to return. He resigned in 1794 and was appointed professor of physics and chemistry at the Central School of Maastricht.|$|E

Raising <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> temperature from 600 degrees C to 1000 degrees C increased <b>the</b> shale <b>oil</b> yield from 9. 50 % to 10. 60 % in the bed with internals, and reached 84. 9 % of <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> yield of Fischer assay (12. 49 wt. % in dry base).

In the bed without any internals such a temperature rise sharply decreased <b>the</b> shale <b>oil</b> yield from 9. 53 % to 4. 60 %. Consequently, the fixed bed with internals would be an advanced reactor also for oil shale pyrolysis, which allows high process efficiency, high oil yield and high oil quality. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.
