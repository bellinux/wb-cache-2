It was so Keats learned, and there was never a finer {{temperament}} for literature than Keats's; it was so, if we could trace it out, that all men have learned; and that is why a revival of letters is always accompanied or heralded by a cast back to earlier and fresher models. Perhaps I hear some one cry out: [...] "But {{this is not the way}} to be original!" [...] It is not; nor is there any way but to be born so. Nor yet, if you are born original, is there anything in this training that shall clip the wings of your originality. There can be none more original than Montaigne, neither could any be more unlike Cicero; yet no craftsman can fail to see how much the one must have tried in his time to imitate the other. Burns is the very type of a prime force in letters: he was of all men the most imitative. Shakespeare himself, the imperial, proceeds directly from a school. It is only from a school that we can expect to have good writers, it is almost invariably from a school that great writers, these lawless exceptions, issue.

So {{it is obvious that}} the shape and the distribution of MFs (not a single MF) must implicate some kinds of knowledge of target function (the function to fit) or the problem we try to model. This paper introduced the entropy E to describe the knowledge discovery of MFs. Then we use this kind of knowledge to explain and qualitatively predict the change of parameters of MFs during the training procedure. By implementing this, we may keep the shapes of MFs and our model comprehensible.

This paper aims to predict this value for Si-Cu interfaces using molecular dynamics simulations. To achieve this goal, a modified embedded atom method interatomic potential for Si-Cu system has been set based upon previous MEAM potentials for pure Cu and pure Si. The Si-Cu cross potential is determined by <b>fitting</b> <b>key</b> properties of the alloy to results obtained by ab initio calculations. It has been further evaluated by comparing the structure and energies of Cu dimmers in bulk Si and CumSin clusters to ab initio calculations. The comparison between MD and ab initio calculation also concerns the energy barrier of Cu migration along the (110) channel in bulk Si. Using this interatomic potential, non equilibrium molecular dynamics has been performed to calculate the thermal contact conductance of a Si-Cu interface at different temperature level. The results obtained are in line with previous experimental results for different kind of interfaces. This confirms that the temperature variation of the thermal conductance might not find its origin in the electron-phonon interactions at the interface nor in the quantification of the energy of the vibration modes.

40|$|This paper {{documents}} that rotation group bias 9 ̆ 6 {{the tendency for}} labor force statistics to vary systematically by month in sample in labor force surveys 9 ̆ 6 in the Current Population Survey (CPS) has worsened considerably over time. The estimated unemployment rate for earlier rotation groups has grown sharply relative to the unemployment rate for later rotation groups; both should be nationally representative samples. The rise in rotation group bias is driven by a growing tendency for respondents to report job search in earlier rotations relative to later rotations. We investigate explanations for the change in bias. We find that rotation group bias increased discretely after the 1994 CPS redesign and that rising nonresponse is likely a significant contributor. Survey nonresponse increased after the redesign, and subsequently trended upward, mirroring the time pattern of rotation group bias. Consistent with this explanation, {{there is only a}} small increase in rotation group bias for households that responded in all eight interviews. An analysis of rotation group bias in Canada and the U. K. reveal no rotation group bias in Canada and a modest and declining bias in the U. K.

Wilson & Bappu (1957) {{have shown}} the {{existence}} of a remarkable correlation between the width of the emission in the core of the K line of Ca II and the absolute visual magnitude of late–type stars. Here we present a new calibration of the Wilson–Bappu effect based on a sample of 119 nearby stars. We use, for the first time, width measurements based on high resolution and high signal to noise ratio CCD spectra and absolute visual magnitudes from the Hipparcos database. Our primary goal is to investigate the possibility of using the Wilson–Bappu effect to determine accurate distances to single stars and groups. The result of our calibration fitting of the Wilson–Bappu relationship is MV = 33. 2 − 18. 0 · log W 0, and the determination seems free of systematic effects. The root mean square error of the fitting is 0. 6 magnitudes. This error is mostly accounted for by measurement errors and intrinsic variability of W 0, but in addition a possible dependence on the metallicity is found, which becomes clearly noticeable for metallicities below [Fe/H]∼- 0. 4. This detection is possible because in our sample [Fe/H] ranges from- 1. 5 to 0. 4. The Wilson–Bappu effect can be used confidently for all metallicities not lower than ∼- 0. 4, including the LMC. While it does not provide accurate distances to single stars, it is a useful tool to determine accurate distances to clusters and aggregates, where a sufficient number of stars can be observed. We apply the Wilson–Bappu effect to published data of the open cluster M 67; the retrieved distance modulus is of 9. 65 magnitude, in very good agreement with the best distance estimations for this cluster, based on main sequence <b>fitting.</b> <b>Key</b> words.

These boundaries are examined via the unity contours and gradients of the plasma β, as well as β∗, which includes the dynamic pressure in the numerator, and the ion mass and number density ratios. It is found that unity contours are well aligned with the gradient extrema, indicating that the unity contour is a topological boundary. In addition, these two transitions of pressure and composition are of a thickness of 0. 05 – 0. 1  RM near the subsolar region to 1 – 1. 5  RM in the tail. The comparison of the pressure and composition boundaries indicates that the two are very similar and that not only the plasma sheet but also the full volume of the lobes are dominated by planetary ions. It suggests that the tail escape for ions not only concentrates in the central plasma sheet but also the magnetic lobes. It is also worthy pointing out that the ion number density ratio unity contour is found to be systematically smaller than other unity boundaries, which calls for attention when the ion number density is used to identify such boundaries.

40|$|The {{glutathione}} transferases (GSTs) {{represent a}} superfamily of dimeric proteins involved in cellular detoxication by catalyzing the nucleophilic {{addition of the}} reduced glutathione (GSH) to the hydrophobic electrophiles. The present work focuses on the functional role of the conserved structures of GSTP 1 - 1. The lock-and-key motif is a highly conserved hydrophobic interaction in the subunit interface of Pi, Mu, and Alpha class GSTs. The key residue (Tyr 50 in hGSTP 1 - 1) of one subunit is wedged into a hydrophobic pocket of the neighboring subunit. The heterodimer GSTP 1 /Y 50 A was constructed from the fully active wild-type GSTP 1 - 1 and the nearly inactive Y 50 A in order to study how an essentially inactive subunit influences {{the activity of the}} neighboring subunit. The results illuminate the vital role of the lock-and-key motif in modulating the GSH binding and the rate of catalysis. Additionally, the two active sites of the dimeric enzyme work synergistically. An observed water network, in hGSTP 1 - 1 structures, connects the two active sites, thereby offering a mechanism for communication between the two active sites. Cys 48 and Tyr 50 were targeted by mutations and chemical modifications for understanding how the α 2 loop residues modulate GSH binding and catalysis. The replacement of Tyr 50 with different unnatural amino acids showed that the nature of the key residue side-chain influences the interaction with the lock structure and, consequently, the catalytic activity. The KMGSH, GSH affinity and protein stability can be modulated by <b>fitting</b> <b>key</b> residue into the lock cavity of the neighbor subunit and, consequently, restriction of the flexibility of the α 2 loop. Optimization of the interaction between the key residue and the lock-cavity increases kcat. Also, the crystal structure of the Cys-free variant was determined.

This dissertation {{consists of two}} essays. In the first essay we analyze the role of frictions {{in the pattern of}} intergenerational transfers. Simple theories about why parents give money to their children fail to explain a central puzzle in inter-generational transfers: While they are alive, parents give more money to their poorer children. When they leave bequests, most parents divide money equally among their children regardless of their income. We develop a model in which parents cannot observe their children's productivity. We show that parents differentiate between gifts and bequests to help their children more effectively. Parents are able to use future income uncertainty to provide the children with more help and better incentives. We show that in our model poor children get more in gifts than richer children and bequests are equal for all children under some parameterizations. We build a richer quantitative model to compare the explanatory power of our model as compared with a frictionless environment when parameters are picked to match US income and wealth data. We find that our model significantly reduces the costs needed to rationalize equal division of bequests relative to a frictionless environment. In the second essay we analyze the role of financial frictions in high asset price volatility. Existing dynamic general equilibrium models have have not been fully successful at explaining the high volatility of asset prices that we observe in the data. We construct a general equilibrium model with heterogeneous firms and financial frictions that addresses this issue. In each period only a fraction of firms can start new projects, which cannot be fully financed externally due to a financial constraint. We allow the tightness of the financial constraint to vary over time. Fluctuations in the tightness of the financial constraint result in fluctuations in the supply of equity and consequently in the price of equity. We calibrate the model to the U.

40|$|Fuel {{cells are}} {{electrochemical}} devices being developed {{for a variety}} of consumer applications including homes and vehicles. Before customers will accept this technology fuel cells must demonstrate suitable durability and reliability. One of the most important parts of a fuel cell stack is the polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM). This layer is responsible for conducting protons from anode to cathode and acting as a gas barrier, while operating in a harsh electrochemical environment. In order to develop better and more durable membranes researchers must understand the linkage between the causes of degradation, such as specific material properties and operational conditions. One significant mode of degradation of the electrolyte membrane is through chemical degradation caused by the crossover of reactant gases leading to the formation of peroxide and ultimately radical species. These radicals are able to attack vulnerable groups in the polymer structure of the membrane. The result is membrane thinning, increased gas crossover, fluoride ion release, and voltage degradation. Considerable experimental work has been done to understand these mechanisms, although there has been no attempt to model the connection between the causes of degradation and the physical effects of degradation on the electrolyte membrane. Such a model {{can be used as a}} valuable tool when evaluating different degradation mechanisms, developing stronger materials, and enable estimation of the influence of fuel cell operation and system design on degradation. This work presents the development and application of a dynamic semi-mechanistic chemical degradation model for a reinforced membrane in a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell. The model was developed using single cell testing with Gore™ PRIMEA® series 5510 catalyst coated membranes under open circuit voltage (OCV) conditions. Such conditions are useful for accelerated testing since they are believed to enhance chemical degradation in membranes since reactant gas partial pressures are at their maximum. It was found that the electrolyte layer closer to the cathode catalyst preferentially degraded. Furthermore, cumulative fluoride release curves for the anode and cathode began to reach plateaus at similar times. The developed model proposes that as the cathode electrolyte layer is degraded, fluoride release slows due to a lack of reactants since the inert reinforcement layer creates a barrier between the cathode and anode electrolyte layers. It is also believed that all fluoride release originates at the degradation site at the cathode. By <b>fitting</b> <b>key</b> parameters, the fluoride release trends were simulated. The proposed model links material properties such as the membrane gas permeability, membrane thickness, and membrane reactivity, as well as operating parameters such as hydrogen partial pressure and relative humidity to fluoride release, thickness change, and crossover. Further investigation into degradation at OCV operation and different relative humidity conditions showed that initial hydrogen crossover measurements were a good indicator of degradation rate over long testing times. The proposed semi-mechanistic model was able to best model the results when using a second order dependence on the hydrogen crossover term. In all cases there was some discrepancy between the model and experimental data after long times. This was attributed to the onset and contribution of anode side degradation. The effect of drawing current on fluoride release was also investigated. Experimental results showed that with increasing current density the fluoride release rate decreased. Using the developed semi-mechanistic model it was proposed that a decrease in hydrogen crossover was primarily responsible for the reduction in chemical degradation of the membrane. A macro-homogeneous model of the anode catalyst layer was used to show that a reduction in hydrogen concentration through the catalyst layer when a current is drawn is a possible reason for the reduction in degradation. Finally the model was applied to three different dynamic drive cycles. The model was able to show that over different drive cycles, the fuel cell will experience different degradation rates. Thus the developed model can be used as a potential tool to evaluate degradation in systems...|$|E

This dissertation {{consists of three}} essays. In the first essay, I develop and compare the implications of two closely related dynamic models of corporate capital structure to determine (i) whether costly capital adjustment is important for understanding the observed financial behavior of firms and, (ii) whether time-varying real investment opportunities or time-varying financial frictions are the key driving force behind corporate capital structure variation over time. In the first model, the firm always has real investment opportunities, capital adjustment is frictionless, and time-varying financial frictions in the debt market interact with the firm’s choice of capital structure (capital market driven model). In the second model, the firm’s real investment opportunities are time-varying, and capital adjustment is costly {{but there is no}} time-varying financial friction in the debt market (investment driven model). In the calibrated capital market driven model, the persistence of dividend, debt, and leverage is too low relative to the data. In the calibrated investment driven model, the persistence of dividend, debt, and leverage is reasonably close to the data. This result suggests that time-varying real investment opportunities, rather than time varying financial frictions, are the key driving force behind corporate capital structure variation over time. This finding holds in a model in which the firm faces both time-varying financial frictions, and time-varying real investment opportunities. The paper also shows that costly capital adjustment is important for understanding the observed persistence of dividend, debt, and leverage. Existing dynamic general equilibrium models have not been fully successful at explaining the high volatility of asset prices that we observe in the data. In the second essay, we construct a general equilibrium model with heterogeneous firms and financial frictions that addresses this issue. In each period only a fraction of firms can start new projects, which cannot be fully financed externally due to a financial constraint. We allow the tightness of the financial constraint to vary over time. Fluctuations in the tightness of the financial constraint result in fluctuations in the supply of equity and consequently in the price of equity. We calibrate the model to the U.

The model generates a volatility in the price of equity comparable to the aggregate stock market while also <b>fitting</b> <b>key</b> aspects of the behavior of aggregate quantities. In third essay, we compare counterfactual corporate bond issuing dates to actual issuing dates in order to test the ability of firms to time the credit market. The 50 most active bond issuing financial firms and the 50 most active industrial firms are studied using one week, one month, and one quarter windows. The ability to time firm-specific CDS prices is studied from January 2002 - October 2009. The ability to time the riskfree rate (10 year US government bond) is studied from January 1988 - October 2009. We find that: firms do not successfully time the risk-free rate or the credit spreads. There is no evidence of CDS timing ability over one week or one month, but there is some borderline evidence at one quarter. For a typical bond issue, the firm loses about 1 % of the face value of the bond relative to a 1 month window, due to their inability to time the market. If the firms could improve their market timing, they could save many hundreds of millions of dollars. Since there is a degree of statistical predictability in the data, we find it surprising that these firms are not able {{to do a better job}} of timing the credit market. ...|$|E

How to reject outliers caused by occlusion and reflections as much as possible before ellipse or spline <b>fitting</b> is a <b>key</b> challenge. For this reason, we proposed a Hough clustering method, which utilizes the shape configuration of iris edge points and their local appearance characteristics to distinguish iris from non-iris edge points. The experimental results show an improved localization performance of the proposed algorithm on CASIA 2. 0 and 3. 0 databases. Key words: Hough clustering, local edge point experts...|$|R

This, of course, requires that the property has an external cold water tap, which can be hard to find on some commercial sites. However, by carrying a range of different <b>fittings,</b> a tap <b>key</b> (for taps that have their handle removed to avoid unwanted water usage), and enough hose on the reel, the cleaner will usually be able to handle this situation.|$|R

Unlike a physical model, the parameters in an empirical model need have no fundamental basis, and {{will depend on}} the fitting procedure used to find them. The <b>fitting</b> procedure is <b>key</b> to success of these models {{if they are to be}} used to extrapolate to designs lying outside the range of data to which the models were originally fitted. Such extrapolation is a hope of such models, but is not fully realized so far.|$|R

Staggering after Magdalen, with the basket of keys {{in one hand and}} the candle in the other, old Mazey sorrowfully compared her figure with the straightness of the poplar, and her disposition with the crookedness of Sin, all the way across [...] "Freeze-your-Bones," [...] and all the way upstairs to her own door. Arrived at that destination, he peremptorily refused to give her the candle until he had first seen her safely inside the room. The conditions being complied with, he resigned the light with one hand, and made a dash with the other at the key, drew it from the inside of the lock, and instantly closed the door. Magdalen heard him outside chuckling over his own dexterity, and <b>fitting</b> the <b>key</b> into the lock again with infinite difficulty. At last he secured the door, with a deep grunt of relief.

40|$|Muth 6 n (1984) {{formulated}} {{a general}} model and estimation procedure for {{structural equation modeling}} {{with a mixture of}} dichotomous, ordered categorical, and continuous measures of latent variables. A general three-stage procedure was developed to obtain estimates, standard errors, and a chi-square measure of fit for a given structural model. While the last step uses generalized least-squares estimation to fit a structural model, the first two steps involve the computation f the statistics used in this model <b>fitting.</b> A <b>key</b> component in the procedure was the development of a GLS weight matrix corresponding to the asymptotic covariance matrix of the sample statistics computed inthe first two stages. This paper extends the description ofthe asymptotics involved an shows how the Muth 6 n formulas can be derived. The emphasis is placed on showing the asymptotic normality of the estimates obtained in the first and second stage and the validity of the weight matrix used in the GLS estimation f the third stage.

5000|$|Styles {{changed in}} the 17th century and men began to wear watches in pockets instead of as {{pendants}} (the woman's watch remained a pendant into the 20th century). This {{is said to have}} occurred in 1675 when Charles II of England introduced waistcoats. [...] This was {{not just a matter of}} fashion or prejudice; watches of the time were notoriously prone to fouling from exposure to the elements, and could only reliably be kept safe from harm if carried securely in the pocket. To fit in pockets, their shape evolved into the typical pocketwatch shape, rounded and flattened with no sharp edges. Glass was used to cover the face beginning around 1610. Watch fobs began to be used, the name originating from the German word fuppe, a small pocket. Later in the 1800s Prince Albert, the consort to Queen Victoria, introduced the 'Albert chain' accessory, designed to secure the pocket watch to the man's outergarment by way of a clip. The watch was wound and also set by opening the back and <b>fitting</b> a <b>key</b> to a square arbor, and turning it.|$|R
