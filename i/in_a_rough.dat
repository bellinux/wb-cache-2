5|$|The {{plane of}} the Milky Way passes through Pyxis. A faint constellation, its three {{brightest}} stars—Alpha, Beta and Gamma Pyxidis—are <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rough</b> line. At magnitude 3.68, Alpha is the constellation's brightest star. It is a blue-white star around 22,000 times as luminous as the Sun. Near Alpha is T Pyxidis, a recurrent nova that has flared up to magnitude 7 every few decades. Three star systems have planets, all discovered by doppler spectroscopy.|$|E
5|$|One {{sequence}} came directly {{after the}} casino robbery, where Batman follows a robbery signal on a tracking device in the Batmobile. He {{shows up at}} the crime scene and finds he is at the wrong place (a beauty salon), in which a room full of girls laugh at him. The Riddler had been throwing Batman off the track by messing with the Batmobile's tracking device. This would explain why in the theatrical version Batman seems to give Riddler and Two-Face moments of free rein over the city. This scene appears <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rough</b> edit on the Special Edition DVD.|$|E

5|$|Glorious keel {{was laid}} down on 1 May 1915 by Harland and Wolff at their Belfast shipyard. She was {{launched}} on 20 April 1916 and completed on 14 October {{at a cost}} of £1,967,223. During her sea trials the following month, her sister Courageous sustained structural damage while running at full speed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rough</b> head sea and had the damaged areas stiffened shortly afterwards to prevent a recurrence. Glorious did not suffer similar damage and did not receive her stiffening until 1918. Upon commissioning, Courageous served with the 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron of the Grand Fleet. After most of the 1st Cruiser Squadron was sunk at the Battle of Jutland, the squadron was re-formed with Courageous and Glorious. Glorious received six twin-tube torpedo mounts in mid-1917: one mount {{on each side of the}} mainmast on the upper deck and two mounts on each side of 'Y' turret on the quarterdeck.|$|E

He also enrolled in Brooklyn College, where he took pre-medical courses, including psychology and nutrition. In 1993, due to financial reasons, he dropped out of school to focus on bodybuilding.|$|E

25|$|The plot of Purge {{focuses on}} two main females, {{both of whom}} reviewers have commented on as complex and are {{integral}} to understanding the themes of the book. The novel begins with Aliide Truu, an elderly woman who has survived many of {{the horrors of the}} Soviet occupation of Estonia. The Aliide who the reader first meets has alienated herself from the local people, though strongly self-reliant. Though cloaked <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rough</b> exterior, she represents a woman who has weathered considerable hardship. She has hardly anything in the way of motherly instinct, especially in regards to the other main character, Zara.|$|E
25|$|Neo-expressionism was a {{style of}} modern {{painting}} that became popular in the late 1970s and dominated the art market until the mid-1980s. It developed in Europe as a reaction against the conceptual and minimalistic art of the 1960s and 1970s. Neo-expressionists returned to portraying recognizable objects, such as the human body (although sometimes in a virtually abstract manner), <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rough</b> and violently emotional way using vivid colours and banal colour harmonies. The veteran painters Philip Guston, Frank Auerbach, Leon Kossoff, Gerhard Richter, A. R. Penck and Georg Baselitz, along with slightly younger artists like Anselm Kiefer, Eric Fischl, Susan Rothenberg, Francesco Clemente, Damien Hirst, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Julian Schnabel, Keith Haring, and many others became known for working in this intense expressionist vein of painting.|$|E
