5|$|According to two {{separate}} research {{studies conducted in}} 2009, {{at the national level}} 65% of the flex-fuel registered vehicles regularly used <b>ethanol</b> fuel, and the usage climbed to 93% in São Paulo, the main <b>ethanol</b> producer state where local taxes are lower, and prices at the pump are more competitive than gasoline. However, as a result of higher <b>ethanol</b> prices caused by the Brazilian <b>ethanol</b> industry crisis that began in 2009, combined with government subsidies to keep gasoline price lower than the international market value, by November 2013 only 23% flex-fuel car owners were using <b>ethanol,</b> down from 66% in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Industry representatives {{complained that}} the final rule overstated the {{environmental}} effects of corn <b>ethanol,</b> and also criticized the inclusion of ILUC as an unfair penalty to domestic corn <b>ethanol</b> because deforestation {{in the developing world}} was being tied to U.S. <b>ethanol</b> production. The 2011 limit for LCFS means that Mid-west corn <b>ethanol</b> failed, unless current carbon intensity was reduced. Oil industry representatives {{complained that the}} standard left oil refiners with few options, such as Brazilian sugarcane <b>ethanol,</b> with its accompanying tariff. CARB officials and environmentalists counter that time and economic incentives will allow produces to adapt.|$|E

5|$|Biofuels are fuels {{derived from}} biomass {{conversion}}, {{as in the}} conversion of cellulose contained in corn stalks, switchgrass, and other biomass into cellulosic <b>ethanol.</b> This process is dependent upon microbial consortia that transform the cellulose into sugars, followed by the fermentation of the sugars into <b>ethanol.</b> Microbes also produce {{a variety of sources}} of bioenergy including methane and hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|Brazil is the world's {{second largest}} {{producer}} of <b>ethanol</b> fuel. Brazil and the United States led the industrial production of <b>ethanol</b> fuel in 2014, together accounting for 83.4 {{percent of the}} world's production. In 2014 Brazil produced 23.4 billion liters (6.19 billion U.S. liquid gallons), representing 25.2 percent of the world's total <b>ethanol</b> used as fuel.|$|E
5|$|Brazilian flex {{cars are}} capable of running on just {{hydrated}} <b>ethanol</b> (E100), or just on a blend of gasoline with 20 to 25% anhydrous <b>ethanol</b> (the mandatory blend since 1993), or on any arbitrary combination of both fuels.|$|E
5|$|Brazilian flex {{engines are}} being {{designed}} with higher compression ratios, {{taking advantage of}} the higher <b>ethanol</b> blends and maximizing the benefits of the higher oxygen content of <b>ethanol,</b> resulting in lower emissions and improving fuel efficiency. The following table shows the evolution and improvement of the different generations of flex engines developed in Brazil.|$|E

5|$|Flexible-fuel {{vehicles}} (FFVs) {{are based}} on dual-fuel systems that supply both fuels into the combustion chamber {{at the same time}} in various calibrated proportions. The most common fuels used by FFVs today are unleaded gasoline and <b>ethanol</b> fuel. <b>Ethanol</b> FFVs can run on pure gasoline, pure <b>ethanol</b> (E100) or any combination of both. Methanol has also been blended with gasoline in flex-fuel vehicles known as M85 FFVs, but their use has been limited mainly to demonstration projects and small government fleets, particularly in California.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{processes}} {{can also}} introduce toxic substances into nontoxic honey produced from nontoxic nectar. Microorganisms in honey can convert {{some of the}} sugars in honey to <b>ethanol.</b> This process of <b>ethanol</b> fermentation is intentionally harnessed to produce the alcoholic beverage called mead from fermented honey.|$|E
5|$|On December 2009 the Renewable Fuels Association (RFA) and Growth Energy, two U.S. <b>ethanol</b> {{lobbying}} groups, filed {{a lawsuit}} challenging LCFS' constitutionality. The two organizations argued that LCFS violated both the Supremacy Clause and the Commerce Clause, jeopardizing the nationwide <b>ethanol</b> market.|$|E
5|$|The E85 blend {{is used in}} {{gasoline}} engines modified to accept such higher concentrations of <b>ethanol,</b> and the fuel injection is regulated through a dedicated sensor, which automatically detects the amount of <b>ethanol</b> in the fuel, allowing to adjust both fuel injection and spark timing accordingly to the actual blend available in the vehicle's tank. Because <b>ethanol</b> contains close to 34% less energy per unit volume than gasoline, E85 FFVs have a lower mileage per gallon than gasoline. Based on EPA tests for all 2006 E85 models, the average fuel economy for E85 vehicles was 25.56% lower than unleaded gasoline.|$|E
5|$|The Ford Model T, {{produced}} from 1908 through 1927, was {{fitted with a}} carburetor with adjustable jetting, allowing use of <b>ethanol,</b> gasoline or kerosene (each by itself), {{or a combination of}} the first two mentioned fuels. Other car manufactures also provided engines for <b>ethanol</b> fuel use. Henry Ford continued to advocate for <b>ethanol</b> as fuel even during the prohibition. However, cheaper oil caused gasoline to prevail, until the 1973 oil crisis resulted in gasoline shortages and awareness on the dangers of oil dependence. This crisis opened a new opportunity for <b>ethanol</b> and other alternative fuels, such as methanol, gaseous fuels such as CNG and LPG, and also hydrogen. <b>Ethanol,</b> methanol and natural gas CNG were the three alternative fuels that received more attention for research and development, and government support.|$|E
5|$|The {{flexibility}} of Brazilian FFVs empowers the consumers {{to choose the}} fuel depending on current market prices. As <b>ethanol</b> fuel economy is lower than gasoline because of ethanol's energy content is close to 34% less per unit volume than gasoline, flex cars running on <b>ethanol</b> get a lower mileage than when running on pure gasoline. However, this effect is partially offset by the usually lower price per liter of <b>ethanol</b> fuel. As a rule of thumb, Brazilian consumers are frequently advised by the media to use more alcohol than gasoline in their mix only when <b>ethanol</b> prices are 30% lower or more than gasoline, as <b>ethanol</b> price fluctuates heavily depending on the result of seasonal sugar cane harvests.|$|E
5|$|The rapid {{success of}} flex {{vehicles}} {{was made possible}} by the existence of 33,000 filling stations with at least one <b>ethanol</b> pump available by 2006, a heritage of the early Pró-Álcool <b>ethanol</b> program. These facts, together with the mandatory use of E25 blend of gasoline throughout the country, allowed Brazil in 2008 to achieve more than 50% of fuel consumption in the gasoline market from sugar cane-based <b>ethanol.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the 1973 oil crisis, the Brazilian {{government}} made mandatory {{the use of}} <b>ethanol</b> blends with gasoline, and neat ethanol-powered cars (E100 only) were launched to the market in 1979, after testing with several prototypes developed by four carmakers. Brazilian carmakers modified gasoline engines to support <b>ethanol</b> characteristics and changes included compression ratio, amount of fuel injected, replacement of materials that would get corroded by the contact with <b>ethanol,</b> use of colder spark plugs suitable for dissipating heat due to higher flame temperatures, and an auxiliary cold-start system that injects gasoline from a small tank in the engine compartment to help starting when cold.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture has {{historically}} been {{a key component of}} the South Dakota economy. Although other industries have expanded rapidly in recent decades, agricultural production is still very important to the state's economy, especially in rural areas. The five most valuable agricultural products in South Dakota are cattle, corn (maize), soybeans, wheat, and hogs. Agriculture-related industries such as meat packing and <b>ethanol</b> production also have a considerable economic impact on the state. South Dakota {{is one of the largest}} producers of <b>ethanol</b> in the nation.|$|E
5|$|Bees {{can suffer}} serious effects from toxic {{chemicals}} in their environments. These include various synthetic chemicals, such as insecticides and fertilizers, {{as well as}} a variety of naturally occurring chemicals from plants, such as <b>ethanol</b> resulting from the fermentation of organic materials. Bee intoxication can result from exposure to <b>ethanol</b> from fermented nectar, ripe fruits, and manmade and natural chemicals in the environment.|$|E
5|$|Brazil {{has one of}} {{the largest}} {{renewable}} energy programs in the world, involving production of <b>ethanol</b> fuel from sugar cane, and <b>ethanol</b> now provides 18 percent of the country's automotive fuel. As a result of this and the exploitation of domestic deep water oil sources, Brazil, which for years had to import a large share of the petroleum needed for domestic consumption, recently reached complete self-sufficiency in liquid fuels.|$|E
5|$|Brazilian flex {{cars are}} capable of running on just {{hydrated}} <b>ethanol</b> (E100), or just on a blend of gasoline with 20 to 25%anhydrous <b>ethanol,</b> or on any arbitrary combination of both fuels. Pure gasoline is no longer sold in the country because these high <b>ethanol</b> blends are mandatory since 1993. Therefore, all Brazilian automakers have optimized flex vehicles to run with gasoline blends from E20 to E25, so these FFVs are unable to run smoothly with pure gasoline {{with the exception of}} two models are specifically built with a flex-fuel engine optimized to operate also with pure gasoline (E0), the Renault Clio Hi-Flex and the Fiat Siena Tetrafuel.|$|E
5|$|Brazil’s {{production}} of <b>ethanol</b> fuel from sugarcane {{dates back to}} the 1970s, as a governmental response to the 1973 oil crisis. Brazil is considered the biofuel industry leader and the world's first sustainable biofuels economy. In 2010 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency designated Brazilian sugarcane <b>ethanol</b> as an advanced biofuel due to EPA's estimated 61% reduction of total life cycle greenhouse gas emissions, including direct indirect land use change emissions.|$|E
5|$|E85 flex-fuel {{vehicles}} {{are becoming increasingly}} common in the Midwest, where corn is a major crop and is the primary feedstock for <b>ethanol</b> fuel production. Regional retail E85 prices vary widely across the US, with more favorable prices in the Midwest region, where most corn is grown and <b>ethanol</b> produced. Depending of the vehicle capabilities, the break-even price of E85 has to be between 25 and 30% lower than gasoline.|$|E
5|$|Fomepizole is {{a potent}} {{inhibitor}} of alcohol dehydrogenase; similar to <b>ethanol,</b> it acts to block {{the formation of the}} toxic metabolites. Fomepizole {{has been shown to be}} highly effective as an antidote for ethylene glycol poisoning. It is the only antidote approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ethylene glycol poisoning. Both antidotes have advantages and disadvantages. <b>Ethanol</b> is readily available in most hospitals, is inexpensive, and can be administered orally as well as intravenously. Its adverse effects include intoxication, hypoglycemia in children, and possible liver toxicity. Patients receiving <b>ethanol</b> therapy also require frequent blood <b>ethanol</b> concentration measurements and dosage adjustments to maintain a therapeutic <b>ethanol</b> concentration. Patients therefore must be monitored in an intensive care unit. Alternatively, the adverse side effects of fomepizole are minimal and the approved dosing regimen maintains therapeutic concentrations without the need to monitor blood concentrations of the drug. The disadvantage of fomepizole is that it is expensive. Costing US$1,000 per gram, an average course used in an adult poisoning would cost approximately $3,500 to $4,000. Despite the cost, fomepizole is gradually replacing <b>ethanol</b> as the antidote of choice in ethylene glycol poisoning. Adjunct agents including thiamine and pyridoxine are often given, because they may help prevent the formation of oxalic acid. The use of these agents is based on theoretical observations and there is limited evidence to support their use in treatment; they may be of particular benefit in people who could be deficient in these vitamins such as malnourished or alcoholic patients.|$|E

5|$|Government {{officials}} and businessmen from Paraguay began negotiations in 2007 with Brazilian automakers {{in order to}} import flex cars that run on any blend of gasoline and <b>ethanol.</b> If successful, Paraguay would become the first destination for Brazilian flex-fuel car exports. In May 2008, the Paraguayan government announced a plan to eliminate import taxes of flex-fuel vehicles and an incentive program for <b>ethanol</b> production. The plan also includes the purchase of 20,000 flex cars in 2009 for the government fleet.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 Timothy Searchinger, {{a lawyer}} from Environmental Defense Fund, {{concluded}} that ILUC affects {{the life cycle}} assessment and that instead of saving, both corn and cellulosic <b>ethanol</b> increased carbon emissions as compared to gasoline by 93 and 50 percent respectively. <b>Ethanol</b> from Brazilian sugarcane performed better, recovering initial carbon emissions in 4 years, while U.S. corn <b>ethanol</b> required 167 years and cellulosic <b>ethanol</b> required a 52 years payback period. The study limited the analysis a 30-year period, assuming that land conversion emits 25 percent of the carbon stored in soils and all carbon in plants cleared for cultivation. Brazil, China, and India were considered among the overseas locations where land use change would occur {{as a result of}} diverting U.S. corn cropland, and it was assumed that new cropland in each of these regions correspond to different types of forest, savanna or grassland based on the historical proportion of each converted to cultivation in these countries during the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{guarantee}} a sustainable development of <b>ethanol</b> production, in September 2009 the government issued by decree a countrywide agroecological land use zoning to restrict sugarcane growth in or near environmentally sensitive areas. According to the new criteria, 92.5% of the Brazilian territory is not suitable for sugarcane plantation. The government considers that the suitable areas are {{more than enough to}} meet the future demand for <b>ethanol</b> and sugar in the domestic and international markets foreseen for the next decades.|$|E
5|$|Molasses is {{commonly}} used to make rum, and sugar byproducts are used to make <b>ethanol</b> for fuel.|$|E
5|$|Other {{topics of}} {{research}} have included investigations into mannitol, dexamethasone, progesterone, xenon, barbiturates, magnesium, calcium channel blockers, PPAR-γ agonists, curcuminoids, <b>ethanol,</b> NMDA antagonists, caffeine.|$|E
5|$|The main Brazilian <b>ethanol</b> {{industry}} organization (UNICA) {{commented that}} such studies missed the continuing intensification of cattle production already underway.|$|E
5|$|The main {{agricultural}} products of Malawi include tobacco, sugarcane, cotton, tea, corn, potatoes, sorghum, cattle and goats. The main industries are tobacco, tea and sugar processing, sawmill products, cement and consumer goods. The industrial production growth rate {{is estimated at}} 10% (2009). The country makes no significant use of natural gas. , Malawi does not import or export any electricity, but does import all its petroleum, with no production in country. Beginning in 2006, the country began mixing unleaded petrol with 10% <b>ethanol,</b> produced in-country at two plants, to reduce dependence on imported fuel. In 2008, Malawi began testing cars that ran solely on <b>ethanol,</b> and initial results are promising, {{and the country is}} continuing to increase its use of <b>ethanol.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{largest single}} use of <b>ethanol</b> is as an engine fuel and fuel additive. Brazil in {{particular}} relies heavily upon {{the use of}} <b>ethanol</b> as an engine fuel, {{due in part to}} its role as the globe's leading producer of <b>ethanol.</b> Gasoline sold in Brazil contains at least 25% anhydrous <b>ethanol.</b> Hydrous <b>ethanol</b> (about 95% <b>ethanol</b> and 5% water) can be used as fuel in more than 90% of new gasoline fueled cars sold in the country. Brazilian <b>ethanol</b> is produced from sugar cane and noted for high carbon sequestration. The US and many other countries primarily use E10 (10% <b>ethanol,</b> sometimes known as gasohol) and E85 (85% <b>ethanol)</b> ethanol/gasoline mixtures.|$|E
25|$|Cellulosic <b>ethanol</b> offers promise because {{cellulose}} fibers, a {{major and}} universal component in plant cells walls, {{can be used}} to produce <b>ethanol.</b> According to the International Energy Agency, cellulosic <b>ethanol</b> could allow <b>ethanol</b> fuels to play a much bigger role in the future.|$|E
25|$|E100 is pure <b>ethanol</b> fuel. Straight hydrous <b>ethanol</b> as an {{automotive}} fuel {{has been widely}} used in Brazil since the late 1970s for neat <b>ethanol</b> vehicles and more recently for flexible-fuel vehicles. The <b>ethanol</b> fuel used in Brazil is distilled close to the azeotrope mixture of 95.63% <b>ethanol</b> and 4.37% water (by weight) which is approximately 3.5% water by volume.|$|E
25|$|Rectified spirit, an {{azeotropic}} {{composition of}} 96% <b>ethanol</b> containing 4% water, {{is used instead}} of anhydrous <b>ethanol</b> for various purposes. Wine spirits are about 94% <b>ethanol</b> (188 proof). The impurities {{are different from those}} in 95% (190 proof) laboratory <b>ethanol.</b>|$|E
