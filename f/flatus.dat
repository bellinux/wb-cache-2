5|$|Under {{ordinary}} {{conditions on}} Earth, elemental hydrogen exists as the diatomic gas, H2. However, hydrogen gas {{is very rare}} in the Earth's atmosphere (1 ppm by volume) because of its light weight, which enables it to escape from Earth's gravity more easily than heavier gases. However, hydrogen is the third most abundant element on the Earth's surface, mostly {{in the form of}} chemical compounds such as hydrocarbons and water. Hydrogen gas is produced by some bacteria and algae and is a natural component of <b>flatus,</b> as is methane, itself a hydrogen source of increasing importance.|$|E
25|$|The {{remaining}} trace (<1% volume) compounds give <b>flatus</b> its smell. Historically, compounds such as indole, skatole, ammonia {{and short}} chain fatty acids {{were thought to}} cause the smell of <b>flatus.</b> More recent evidence proves that the major contribution to the smell of <b>flatus</b> comes {{from a combination of}} volatile sulfur compounds (VSC). It is known that hydrogen sulfide (H2S), methyl mercaptan, MM (also known as methanethiol, MT), dimethyl sulfide (DMS), dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) and dimethyl trisulfide (DMTS) are present in <b>flatus.</b> The benzopyrrole volatiles indole and skatole have a mothball smell, and therefore probably do not contribute greatly to the characteristic smell of <b>flatus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although <b>flatus</b> {{possesses}} physiological smell, {{this may}} be abnormally increased in some patients and cause social distress to the patient. Increased smell of <b>flatus</b> presents a distinct clinical issue from other complaints related to intestinal gas. Some patients may exhibit over-sensitivity to bad <b>flatus</b> smell, and in extreme forms, olfactory reference syndrome may be diagnosed.|$|E
25|$|In one study, H2S {{concentration}} {{was shown}} to correlate convincingly with perceived bad smell of <b>flatus,</b> followed by MM and DMS. This {{is supported by the}} fact that H2S may be the most abundant VSC present. These results were generated from subjects who were eating a diet high in pinto beans to stimulate <b>flatus</b> production. Others report that MM was the greatest contributor to the smell of <b>flatus</b> in patients not under any specific dietary alterations. It has now been demonstrated that MM, DMS and H2S (described as decomposing vegetables, unpleasantly sweet/wild radish and rotten eggs respectively) are all present in human <b>flatus</b> in concentrations above their smell perception thresholds. It is known that increased dietary sulfur-containing amino acids significantly increases the smell of <b>flatus.</b> It is therefore likely that the smell of <b>flatus</b> is created by a combination of VSC, with minimal contribution from non-sulfur volatiles. Such smell can also be caused by the presence of large numbers of microflora bacteria or the presence of faeces in the rectum. Diets high in protein, especially sulfur-containing amino acids, have been demonstrated to significantly increase the smell of <b>flatus.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{the normal}} range of volumes of <b>flatus</b> in normal individuals varies hugely (476–1,491ml/24h). All intestinal gas is either swallowed environmental air, present intrinsically in foods and beverages or the result of gut fermentation. Swallowing small amounts of air occurs while eating and drinking. This is emitted from the mouth by eructation (burping) and is normal. Excessive swallowing of environmental air is called aerophagia, and {{has been shown in}} a few case reports to be responsible for increased <b>flatus</b> volume. This is however considered a rare cause of increased <b>flatus</b> volume. Gases contained in food and beverages is likewise emitted largely through eructation, e.g., carbonated beverages. Endogenously produced intestinal gases make up 74 percent of <b>flatus</b> in normal subjects. The volume of gas produced is partially dependent upon the composition of the intestinal microbiota, which is normally very resistant to change, but is also very different in different individuals. Some patients are predisposed to increased endogenous gas production by virtue of their gut microbiota composition. The greatest concentration of gut bacteria is in the colon, while the small intestine is normally near sterile. Fermentation occurs when unabsorbed food residues may arrive in the colon. Therefore, even more than the composition of the microbiota, diet is the primary factor that dictates the volume of <b>flatus</b> produced. Diets that aim {{to reduce the amount of}} undigested fermentable food residues arriving in the colon have been shown to significantly reduce the volume of <b>flatus</b> produced. Again, it is emphasised that increased volume of intestinal gas will not cause bloating and pain in normal subjects. Abnormal intestinal gas dynamics will create pain, distension, and bloating, regardless of whether there is high or low total <b>flatus</b> volume.|$|E
25|$|<b>Flatus</b> (intestinal gas) {{is mostly}} {{produced}} as {{a byproduct of}} bacterial fermentation in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, especially the colon. There are reports of aerophagia (excessive air swallowing) causing excessive intestinal gas, but this is considered rare. Over 99% {{of the volume of}} <b>flatus</b> is composed of non-smelly gases. These include oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen and methane. Nitrogen is not produced in the gut, but a component of environmental air. Patients who have excessive intestinal gas that is mostly composed of nitrogen have aerophagia. Hydrogen, carbon dioxide and methane are all produced in the gut and contribute 74% of the volume of <b>flatus</b> in normal subjects. Methane and hydrogen are flammable, and so <b>flatus</b> containing adequate amounts of these can be ignited. Not all humans produce <b>flatus</b> that contains methane. For example, in one study of the faeces of nine adults, only five of the samples contained archaea capable of producing methane. The prevalence of methane over hydrogen in human farts may correlate with obesity, constipation and irritable bowel syndrome, as archaea that oxidise hydrogen into methane promote the metabolism's ability to absorb fatty acids from food.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{being an}} ancient {{treatment}} for various digestive complaints, activated charcoal {{did not produce}} reduction in both the total <b>flatus</b> volume nor the release of sulfur-containing gasses, {{and there was no}} reduction in abdominal symptoms (after 0.52g activated charcoal four times a day for 1 week). The authors suggested that saturation of charcoal binding sites during its passage through the gut was the reason for this. A further study concluded that activated charcoal (4g) does not influence gas formation in vitro or in vivo. Other authors reported that activated charcoal was effective. A study in 8 dogs concluded activated charcoal (unknown oral dose) reduced H2S by 71%. In combination with yucca schidigera, and zinc acetate, this was increased to an 86% H2S reduction, although total <b>flatus</b> volume and number of <b>flatus</b> events was unchanged. An early study reported activated charcoal (unknown oral dose) prevented a large {{increase in the number of}} <b>flatus</b> events and increased breath hydrogen concentrations that normally occur following a gas-producing meal.|$|E
25|$|<b>Flatus</b> {{incontinence}} {{where there}} is involuntary passage of gas, {{is a type of}} faecal incontinence, and is managed similarly.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{continuous}} spectrum of different clinical presentations from incontinence of <b>flatus</b> (gas), through incontinence of mucus or liquid stool, to solids. The term anal incontinence often {{is used to}} describe <b>flatus</b> incontinence, however it is also used as a synonym for FI generally. It may occur together with incontinence of liquids or solids, or it may present in isolation. <b>Flatus</b> incontinence {{may be the first}} sign of FI. Once continence to <b>flatus</b> is lost, it is rarely restored. Anal incontinence may be equally disabling as the other types. Fecal leakage, fecal soiling and fecal seepage are minor degrees of FI, and describe incontinence of liquid stool, mucus, or very small amounts of solid stool. They cover a spectrum of increasing symptom severity (staining, soilage, seepage and accidents). Rarely, minor FI in adults may be described as encopresis. Fecal leakage is a related topic to rectal discharge, but this term does not necessarily imply any degree of incontinence. Discharge generally refers to conditions where there is pus or increased mucus production, or anatomical lesions that prevent the anal canal from closing fully, whereas fecal leakage generally concerns disorders of IAS function and functional evacuation disorders which cause a solid fecal mass to be retained in the rectum. Solid stool incontinence may be called complete (or major) incontinence, and anything less as partial (or minor) incontinence (i.e. incontinence of <b>flatus</b> (gas), liquid stool and/or mucus).|$|E
25|$|The {{antibiotic}} rifaximin, {{often used}} to treat diarrhoea caused by the microorganism E. coli, may reduce both the production of intestinal gas {{and the frequency of}} <b>flatus</b> events.|$|E
25|$|Patients who {{complain}} of bloating frequently {{can be shown}} to have objective increases in abdominal girth, often increased throughout the day and then resolving during sleep. The increase in girth combined {{with the fact that}} the total volume of <b>flatus</b> is not increased led to studies aiming to image the distribution of intestinal gas in patients with bloating. They found that gas was not distributed normally in these patients: there was segmental gas pooling and focal distension. In conclusion, abdominal distension, pain and bloating symptoms are the result of abnormal intestinal gas dynamics rather than increased <b>flatus</b> production.|$|E
25|$|LIS does, however, have {{a number}} of {{potential}} side effects including problems with incision site healing and incontinence to <b>flatus</b> and faeces (some surveys of surgical results suggest incontinence rates of up to 36%).|$|E
25|$|A {{flexible}} tube, {{inserted into}} the rectum, {{can be used to}} collect intestinal gas in a <b>flatus</b> bag. This method is occasionally needed in a hospital setting, when the patient is unable to pass gas normally.|$|E
25|$|One {{method of}} {{reducing}} the volume of <b>flatus</b> produced is dietary modification, {{reducing the amount of}} fermentable carbohydrates. This is the theory behind diets such as the low FODMAP diet (low fermentable oligosaccharide, dissacharide, monosaccharide and polyols).|$|E
25|$|While the act {{of passing}} <b>flatus</b> in said {{cultures}} is {{generally considered to be}} an unfortunate occurrence in public settings, flatulence may, in casual circumstances and especially among children, be used as either a humorous supplement to a joke ("pull my finger"), or as a comic activity in and of itself. The social acceptability of flatulence-based humour in entertainment and the mass media varies over the course of time and between cultures. Enough entertainers performed with their <b>flatus</b> that the term flatulist was coined. The whoopee cushion is a joking device invented in the early 20th century for simulating a fart. In 2008, a farting application for the iPhone earned nearly $10,000 in one day.|$|E
25|$|Normal <b>flatus</b> {{volume range}} is around 476 to 1,491nbsp&ml per 24 hours. This {{variability}} between individuals is greatly dependent upon diet. Similarly {{the number of}} <b>flatus</b> episodes per day is variable, the normal range is given as 8–20 per day. The volume of <b>flatus</b> associated with each flatulence event again varies (5–375nbsp&ml). The volume of the first flatulence upon waking in the morning is significantly larger than those during the day. This {{may be due to}} buildup of intestinal gas in the colon during sleep, the peak in peristaltic activity in the first few hours after waking or the strong prokinetic effect of rectal distension on the rate of transit of intestinal gas. It is now known that gas is moved along the gut independently of solids and liquids, and this transit is more efficient in the erect position compared to when supine. It is thought that large volumes of intestinal gas present low resistance, and can be propelled by subtle changes in gut tone, capacitance and proximal contraction and distal relaxation. This process is thought not to affect solid and liquid intra-lumenal contents.|$|E
25|$|Flatulence {{is often}} blamed as a {{significant}} source of greenhouse gases, owing to the erroneous belief that the methane released by livestock is in the <b>flatus.</b> While livestock account for around 20% of global methane emissions, 90–95% of that is released by exhaling or burping.|$|E
25|$|Interest in {{the causes}} of {{flatulence}} was spurred by high-altitude flight and manned spaceflight; the low atmospheric pressure, confined conditions, and stresses peculiar to those endeavours were cause for concern. In the field of mountaineering, the phenomenon of high altitude <b>flatus</b> expulsion was first recorded over two hundred years ago.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{investigating}} {{the role of}} sensory nerve endings in the anal canal did not find them to be essential for retaining fluids in the anus, and instead speculate that their role may be to distinguish between <b>flatus</b> and faeces, thereby helping detect a need to defecate or to signal the end of defecation.|$|E
25|$|Since soluble soy {{carbohydrates}} {{are found}} in the whey and are broken down during fermentation, soy concentrate, soy protein isolates, tofu, soy sauce, and sprouted soybeans are without <b>flatus</b> activity. On the other hand, there may be some beneficial effects to ingesting oligosaccharides such as raffinose and stachyose, namely, encouraging indigenous bifidobacteria in the colon against putrefactive bacteria.|$|E
25|$|In beans, {{endogenous}} gases seem {{to arise}} from complex oligosaccharides (carbohydrates) that are particularly resistant to digestion by mammals, but are readily digestible by gut flora – microorganisms (methane-producing archaea; Methanobrevibacter smithii) that inhabit the digestive tract. These oligosaccharides {{pass through the}} upper intestine largely unchanged, and when they reach the lower intestine, bacteria feed on them, producing copious amounts of <b>flatus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Flatulence-producing {{foods are}} {{typically}} high in certain polysaccharides, especially oligosaccharides such as inulin. Those foods include beans, lentils, dairy products, onions, garlic, spring onions, leeks, turnips, swedes, radishes, sweet potatoes, potatoes, cashews, Jerusalem artichokes, oats, wheat, and yeast in breads. Cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage, Brussels sprouts and other cruciferous vegetables {{that belong to}} the genus Brassica are commonly reputed to not only increase flatulence, but to increase the pungency of the <b>flatus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Digestive enzyme {{supplements}} may {{significantly reduce}} the amount of flatulence caused by some components of foods not being digested by the body and thereby promoting the action of microbes in the small and large intestines. It has been suggested that alpha-galactosidase enzymes, which can digest certain complex sugars, are effective in reducing the volume and frequency of <b>flatus.</b> The enzymes alpha-galactosidase, lactase, amylase, lipase, protease, cellulase, glucoamylase, invertase, malt diastase, pectinase, and bromelain are available, either individually or in combination blends, in commercial products.|$|E
25|$|Bacterial {{overgrowth}} {{can cause}} a variety of symptoms, {{many of which are}} also found in other conditions, making the diagnosis challenging at times. Many of the symptoms are due to malabsorption of nutrients due to the effects of bacteria which either metabolize nutrients or cause inflammation of the small bowel, impairing absorption. The symptoms of bacterial overgrowth include nausea, <b>flatus,</b> constipation, bloating, abdominal distension, abdominal pain or discomfort, diarrhea, fatigue, and weakness. SIBO also causes an increased permeability of the small intestine. Some patients may lose weight. Children with bacterial overgrowth may develop malnutrition and have difficulty attaining proper growth. Steatorrhea, a sticky type of diarrhea where fats are not properly absorbed and spill into the stool, may also occur.|$|E
25|$|The {{defining}} {{feature of}} ORS is excessive thoughts of having offensive body odor(s) which are detectable to others. The individual may {{report that the}} odor comes from: the nose and/or mouth, i.e. halitosis (bad breath), the anus, the genitals, the skin generally, or specifically the groin, armpits or feet. The source(s) of the supposed odor may also change over time. There are also some who are unsure of the exact origin of the odor. The odor is typically reported to be continuously present. The character of the odor may be reported as similar to bodily substances, e.g. feces, <b>flatus,</b> urine, sweat, vomitus, semen, vaginal secretions; or alternatively {{it may be an}} unnatural, non-human or chemical odor, e.g. ammonia, detergent, rotten onions, burnt rags, candles, garbage, burning fish, medicines, old cheese. Again, the reported character of the odor complaint may change over time. Halitosis appears to be the most common manifestation of ORS, with 75% complaining of bad breath, alone or in combination with other odors. The next most common complaint was sweat (60%).|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanisms}} and {{factors contributing to}} normal continence are multiple and inter-related. The puborectalis sling, forming the anorectal angle (see diagram), is responsible for gross continence of solid stool. The IAS is an involuntary muscle, contributing about 55% of the resting anal pressure. Together with the hemorrhoidal vascular cushions, the IAS maintains continence of <b>flatus</b> and liquid during rest. The EAS is a voluntary muscle, doubling the pressure in the anal canal during contraction, which is possible for a short time. The rectoanal inhibitory reflex (RAIR) is an involuntary IAS relaxation in response to rectal distension, allowing some rectal contents to descend into the anal canal where it is brought into contact with specialized sensory mucosa to detect consistency. The rectoanal excitatory reflex (RAER) is an initial, semi-voluntary contraction of the EAS and puborectalis which in turn prevents incontinence following the RAIR. Other factors include the specialized anti-peristaltic function of {{the last part of}} the sigmoid colon, which keeps the rectum empty most of the time, sensation in the lining of the rectum and the anal canal to detect when there is stool present, its consistency and quantity, and the presence of normal rectoanal reflexes and defecation cycle which completely evacuates stool from the rectum and anal canal. Problems affecting any of these {{mechanisms and}} factors may be involved in the cause.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are five}} general {{symptoms}} related to intestinal gas: pain, bloating and abdominal distension, excessive <b>flatus</b> volume, excessive <b>flatus</b> smell and gas incontinence. Furthermore, eructation ("an act or instance of belching", colloquially known as [...] "burping") is sometimes included under {{the topic of}} flatulence.|$|E
2500|$|Hypolactasia; {{persistent}} diarrhea; abdominal cramps; bloating; nausea; <b>flatus</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|... 1 - those {{continent}} for {{solid and}} liquid stool and also for <b>flatus.</b>|$|E
2500|$|It {{is normal}} {{for humans to}} pass <b>flatus</b> through the rectum, {{although}} the volume and frequency may vary greatly between individuals. It is also normal for intestinal gas passed through the rectum to have a characteristic [...] smell, although this too may vary in concentration. <b>Flatus</b> is brought to the rectum by specialised contractions of the muscles in the intestines and colon. The noises commonly associated with flatulence ("blowing a raspberry") are caused by the vibration of anal sphincters, and occasionally by the closed buttocks. Both the noise and smell associated with <b>flatus</b> leaving the anus can be sources of embarrassment or comedy in many cultures.|$|E
2500|$|... 3 - those {{continent}} for solid stool but incontinent for liquid stool or <b>flatus.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Flatulence {{is defined}} in the medical {{literature}} as [...] "flatus expelled through the anus" [...] or the [...] "quality or state of being flatulent", which {{is defined in}} turn as [...] "marked by or affected with gases generated in the intestine or stomach; likely to cause digestive flatulence". The root of these words is from the Latin <b>flatus</b> – [...] "a blowing, a breaking wind". <b>Flatus</b> is also the medical word for gas generated in the stomach or bowels. Despite these standard definitions, a proportion of intestinal gas may be swallowed environmental air, and hence <b>flatus</b> is not totally generated in the stomach or bowels. The scientific study of this area of medicine is termed flatology.|$|E
2500|$|... 2 - those {{continent}} for {{solid and}} liquid stool but incontinent for <b>flatus</b> (with or without urgency).|$|E
2500|$|Anal dilation, or {{stretching}} of the anal canal (Lord's operation), {{has fallen}} out of favour in recent years, primarily due to the unacceptably high incidence of fecal incontinence. [...] In addition, anal stretching can increase the rate of <b>flatus</b> incontinence.|$|E
2500|$|... "Gas incontinence" [...] {{could be}} defined as loss of {{voluntary}} control over the passage of <b>flatus.</b> It is a recognised subtype of faecal incontinence, and is usually related to minor disruptions of the continence mechanisms. Some consider gas incontinence to be the first, sometimes only, symptom of faecal incontinence.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{bacterial}} products include gas (<b>flatus),</b> {{which is}} a mixture of nitrogen and carbon dioxide, with small amounts of the gases hydrogen, methane, and hydrogen sulfide. [...] Bacterial fermentation of undigested polysaccharides produces these. Some of the fecal odor is due to indoles, metabolized from the amino acid tryptophan. The normal flora is also essential in the development of certain tissues, including the cecum and lymphatics.|$|E
