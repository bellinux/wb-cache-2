25|$|Constructed {{wetlands}} {{are designed}} to remove stormwater pollutants associated with fine to colloidal particles and dissolved contaminants. These shallow, extensively vegetated water bodies use enhanced sedimentation, <b>fine</b> <b>filtration</b> and biological uptake to remove these pollutants. They usually comprise three zones: an inlet zone (sedimentation basin) to remove coarse sediments; a macrophyte zone, a heavily vegetated area to remove fine particulates and uptake of soluble pollutants; and a high flow bypass channel to protect the macrophyte zone. The macrophyte zone generally includes a marsh zone {{as well as an}} open water zone and has an extended depth of 0.25 to 0.5m with specialist plant species and a retention time of 48 to 72 hours. Constructed Wetlands can also provide a flow control function by rising during rainfall and then slowly releasing the stored flows. Constructed wetlands will improve the runoff water quality depending on the wetland processes. The key treatment mechanism of wetlands are physical (trapping suspended solids and adsorbed pollutants), biological and chemical uptake (trapping dissolved pollutants, chemical adsorption of pollutants), and pollutant transformation (more stable sediment fixation, microbial processes, UV disinfection).|$|E

The effect of combining different fiber diameters in order to reach the best compromise is also investigated. Our results show that the use of binary blends of different fiber diameters improves overall filtration behavior, in comparison to nonwoven filters with equivalent unimodal diameter distribution.

30|$|Electrospinning is {{a process}} that can produce polymer nanofibers with diameters ranging from {{nanometer}} to sub-micrometers. The non-woven mats obtained from the electrospun nanofibers show a number of interesting characteristics such as high porosity, large surface area per unit mass, high gas permeability, and small inter-fibrous pore size. These properties qualify non-woven mats for a number of applications such as scaffolds in tissue engineering [1], electrically conductive nanofiber [2], drug delivery systems [3], nanofibrous membranes for <b>fine</b> <b>filtration</b> [4], and protective clothing [5]. During an electrospinning process, a high voltage is applied to a polymer solution or melt between a needle-tip and a metallic collector. The accumulated charges on the surface of droplet destabilize the partially hemispherical shape of the droplet, which converts into a Taylor’s cone when the electric field is increased [6]. When the voltage reaches a critical value, the electric forces overcome the surface tension on the droplet and a jet of ultra-fine fibers is produced from the tip of the Taylor cone. The nanofibers of various polymers such as polyurethane [7], poly(p-phenylene terephthalamide) [8], polycaprolactone [9], nylon- 6 [10], gelatin [11], polystyrene [12], polyaniline/polyethylene oxide blends [13], etc., have been prepared by using an electrospinning process.|$|E

40|$|Nanofibers {{are very}} thin fibers having diameters lower than 100 nm and their lengths {{might be as}} long as {{possible}} within production limits. The large surface area of nanofibers gives opportunity to functionalize them. Nanofibers have several applications including both applications for industrial production in many sectors and for research studies. Nanofibers find applications in energy devices such as solar cells, fuel cells and nanogenarators; in filtration applications (such as water/oil <b>filtration,</b> <b>fine</b> particle <b>filtration,</b> aerosol filtration, air filtration, nanoparticle filtration) and in several medical applications including antibacterial efficacy, wound healing, drug delivery and scaffolds for tissue engineering. There are several methods to produce nanofibers: Electrospinning, self assembly, phase separation, bacterial cellulose, templating, drawing, extraction, vapor-phase polymerization, kinetically controlled solution synthesis, conventional chemical polymerization for anyline. Electrospinning is the most widely used method to produce nanofibers. In electrospinning, a high electric field, which is in kilovolts, is applied to a polymer solution. The polymer solution is drawn from a syringe to a collector surface. Electrospinning requires usage of appropriate solvent, removal of evaporating solvent, an adequate power supply to overcome the viscosity and surface tension of the polymer solution; while, jet instability and jet control remain as challenges in electrospinning. Nanofiber production methods possess some disadvantages as: higher cost compared to conventional fiber production methods, health hazards such as inhale risk of nanofibers during production and keeping the environment safe from evaporating solvents used during nanofiber production. Up to date, many researches have been conducted on nanofibers and electrospinning; still, more controllable, more cost effective, more environmentally friendly and safer methods are of essential importance to future applications of nanofibers. ...|$|R
