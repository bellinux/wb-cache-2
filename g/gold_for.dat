5|$|Development of {{the game}} began {{after the release of}} Killer Instinct 2, in which a team was split into making Killer Instinct <b>Gold</b> <b>for</b> the Nintendo 64 and a new racing game for that console. At its first stage of development, Diddy Kong Racing was {{conceived}} as a real-time strategy game with a caveman/time-travel theme worked on by a team of four Rare members; Chris Stamper, Lee Musgrave, Rob Harrison and Lee Schuneman. During later stages of development, the game became influenced by Walt Disney World and soon evolved into an adventure game called Wild Cartoon Kingdom, with which Nintendo had no involvement. In June 1997, the game was altered to Pro Am 64, an unrelated follow-up to the NES racing game R.C. Pro-Am. According to Schuneman, the Pro Am 64 project featured three-wheeled trikes in contrast to radio-controlled cars.|$|E

Brooks led off in the heat, setting a time of 50.36s, before Stockwell made up a deficit of 0.41s during the anchor leg to beat the hosts by 0.20s. Australia and the United States had stamped their authority on the event, qualifying almost four seconds faster than third-placed Sweden. However, the Americans had more speed in reserve, having rested 200m freestyle silver medalist Mike Heath and 100m freestyle gold medallist Rowdy Gaines, whereas Australia used its full-strength team.|$|E
