5000|$|In {{addition}} to use against people, the U.S. military considered chemical attacks to kill crops {{in an attempt}} to starve the Japanese into submission. The Army began experimenting with compounds to destroy crops in April 1944, and within one year had narrowed over 1,000 agents to nine promising ones containing phenoxyacetic acids. One compound designated LN-8 performed best in tests and went into mass production. <b>Dropping</b> <b>or</b> <b>spraying</b> the herbicide was deemed the most effective employment method; a July 1945 test from an SPD Mark 2 bomb, originally crafted to hold biological weapons like anthrax or ricin, had the shell burst open at a predetermined height to send the chemical agent flying. By the time the war ended, the Army was still trying to determine the optimal dispersal height to cover a wide enough area. Active ingredients in LN-8 and another tested compound would later be used to create Agent Orange, used during the Vietnam War. Proposed gas attacks as well as the use of atomic weapons were contemplated to avoid having “an Okinawa from one end of Japan to the other.” ...|$|E

50|$|Some {{volcanic}} eruptions are explosive because the mixing between water and magma reaching the surface, releases energy suddenly. Moreover, in some cases, the eruption {{is caused by}} volatiles dissolved in the magma.Approaching the surface, pressure decreases and the volatiles evolve creating bubbles that circulate in the liquid.

In order to assemble nanoparticles on to a heat transfer surface as a thin layer, a boiling adhesion method (BAM) is originally introduced in which, water or water/ethanol solution with mono-dispersed nanoparticles is <b>dropped</b> <b>or</b> <b>sprayed</b> onto a high temperature surface, and then the nanoparticles deposit onto the heat transfer surface during the boiling.

40|$|The {{influence}} of heating at {{a temperature of}} 50 °C and UV-irradiation of propolis drops and spray on their free radical scavenging activity was determined. The kinetics of interactions of the propolis samples with DPPH free radicals was analyzed. Interactions of propolis drops and propolis spray with free radicals were examined by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. A spectrometer generating microwaves of 9. 3 GHz frequency was used. The EPR spectra of the model DPPH free radicals were compared with the EPR spectra of DPPH {{in contact with the}} tested propolis samples. The antioxidative activity of propolis drops and propolis spray decreased after heating at the temperature of 50 °C. A UV-irradiated sample of propolis drops more weakly scavenged free radicals than an untreated sample. The antioxidative activity of propolis spray increased after UV-irradiation. The sample of propolis drops heated at the temperature of 50 °C quenched free radicals faster than the unheated sample. UV-irradiation weakly changed the kinetics of propolis <b>drops</b> <b>or</b> <b>spray</b> interactions with free radicals. EPR analysis indicated that propolis drops and spray should not be stored at a temperature of 50 °C. Propolis drops should not be exposed to UV-irradiation...|$|R
30|$|Following {{the first}} {{classification}} of arc types in 1976 (Lancaster 1984), several further classifications have been proposed. Short arc, globular arc, and spray arc {{are the three}} major classifications of arc types by the American Welding Society (AWS) (Iordachescu and Quintino 2008). The International Institute of Welding (IIW), in 1984, divided spray arc types into the three categories: (i) <b>drop</b> <b>spray</b> <b>or</b> projected <b>spray,</b> (ii) rotating spray, and (iii) streaming spray (Iordachescu and Quintino 2008; Lancaster 1986). Norrish (2003) and then Ponomarev et al. (2003) modified this categorization. Utilization of digital control of power sources has led to many improvements in arc control, especially in welding with short and pulsed arcs. Digital control increases the reaction speed of the power source inverter {{and the use of}} sophisticated software makes it possible to directly influence the arc (Weman 2003; Iordachescu and Quintino 2008).|$|R
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of various routes of {{administration of the}} live attenuated rubella virus vaccine was evaluated by using 46 seronegative volunteers who were divided into 4 vaccine groups: subcutaneous, nosedrops, spray into posterior oropharynx and nose using large particle aerosol, and inhalation of small particle aerosol through the mouth. Seroconversion was observed {{in all of the}} vaccinees regardless of route of immunization. Nasal secretion antibody 6 weeks after immunization was highest in the volunteers who received the vaccine by nose drops (all members of this group had demonstrable nasal secretion antibody after immunization). Only half of the volunteers in the subcutaneous group developed demonstrable nasal secretion antibody. This suggests that nasal secretion antibody was best stimulated when vaccine was given directly into the nose. Volunteers were challenged with the vaccine intranasally at 6 to 8 weeks. None of the volunteers exhibited clinical symptoms or fourfold or greater serum antibody rises after challenge, but fourfold or greater nasal secretion antibody rises were observed in three volunteers in the subcutaneous vaccine group and two in the aerosol group, suggesting that those volunteers had not been protected against challenge. Rubella virus was isolated 8 to 12 days after challenge in two persons in the subcutaneous group and three in the aerosol vaccine group, but none in the nose <b>drops</b> <b>or</b> <b>spray</b> groups. Thus, protection after nasal challenge appeared to be best in those groups which also had the best nasal secretion antibody response after immunization. However, protection {{did not seem to be}} correlated with either nasal secretion or serum antibody levels...|$|R
40|$|A new thermosensitive {{hydrogel}} {{was designed}} and prepared by simply mixing N-[(2 -hydroxy- 3 -trimethylammonium) propyl] chitosan chloride (HTCC) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) {{with a small amount}} of alpha,-beta-glycerophosphate (alpha-beta-GP). The optimum preparative condition was investigated, and the obtained formulation underwent thermal transition from solution below or at room temperature to non-flowing hydrogel around 37 degrees C in several minutes. As a new formulation, its potential use as nasal drug delivery system was studied. It can be <b>dropped</b> <b>or</b> <b>sprayed</b> easily into nasal cavity and spread on the nasal mucosa in solution state. After being administered into nasal cavity, the solution transformed into viscous hydrogel at body temperature, which decreased nasal mucociliary clearance rate and released drug slowly. Morever, quaternized chitosan as absorption enhancer has been studied extensively in several reports and proved its non-toxicity, mucoadhesivity and the capacity to open the tight junctions between epithelial cells. Therefore, in this study insulin as a model drug was entrapped in this formulation and its release behavior in vitro was also investigated. The enhancement of absorption of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) -labeled insulin in rat nasal cavity by this formulation was proved by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The cytoxicity and the change of the blood glucose concentration after nasal administration of this hydrogel were also investigated. The hydrogel formulation decreased the blood glucose concentration apparently (40 - 50 % of initial blood glucose concentration) for at least 4 - 5 h after administration, and no apparent cytoxicity was found after application. These results showed that HTCC-PEG-GP formulation can be used as nasal drug delivery system to improve the absorption of hydrophilic macromolecular drugs. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|AbstractThree charge {{transfer}} complexes of azelastine as n-donor with π acceptors, dichloro-dicyanobenzoquinone (DDQ), chloranilic acid (CA) and tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) were prepared in acetonitrile. They yield a radical anions measured at 456, 520 and 841 nm within concentration ranges of 8. 0 – 72, 40 – 320 and 1. 6 – 14. 4 μgmL− 1 with good correlation coefficients (r= 0. 9996 – 0. 9998).

30|$|Electrophoresis is a {{derivative}} of inking deposition. Electrophoresis involves the motion, placement, and potentially modest alignment of <b>drop</b> <b>or</b> <b>spray</b> deposited CNTs. Electrophoresis exploits the CNTs native anisotropic charge distribution and its interaction with an applied electric field [160, 167, 168]. Elsewhere {{it has been}} widely used {{as a means of}} depositing phosphor materials. It has also been applied to the deposition of bundles of SWCNTs on various substrates, such as stainless steel or doped Si [167 – 179]. Composite CNT films deposited by electrophoresis have been fabricated with controlled surface density with good field emission performance, current density and long-term stability under high operating voltages, which has been applied to an electron source for high-resolution X-ray imaging [160]. Wang et al. [169] deposited MWCNTs on Cr/Cu electrodes supported on an oxidised Si support with a glass interlayer adhesion promoter. The emitters were annealed at 480 °C for 30  min following deposition to mobilise the glass interlayer and reduce the effective interfacial resistance. As with other solution-based fabrication techniques, {{in order to reduce the}} emitters turn-on bias they were taped to activate them; a threshold field of 3.5  V/μm was measured (for an emission current density of 10  μA/cm 2). Though a simple and low-cost means of defining the pixel size, electrophorectially defined emission zones only allow for relatively large cathode diameters, of the order of 2  mm, which reduces the systems functionality. Calderón-Colón et al. [160] employed photolithography and liquid phase electrophoretic deposition to pattern disordered and unaligned MWCNTs in a homogenous solution with MgCl 2 and glass frits. Here the film thickness was broadly controlled by the deposition time and the magnitude of the applied voltage, though accurate sample-to-sample reproducibility and control over the thickness, to < 10  nm surface roughness, is challenging. Such techniques are comparatively low in uniformity and reproducibility, a direct consequence of the simple macro scale processing. Moreover, the common binder matrices are far from pure, making elucidation of the underlying emission mechanisms somewhat challenging, though nonetheless functional. Indeed, as with all other inking deposition techniques, the emitters do require mechanical activation for the cathodes to be of any practical use, though electrophoretic patterning is indeed rapid and simple to implement.|$|R
40|$|A nasal vaccine, {{consisting}} of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) from group B Neisseria meningitidis, {{was given to}} 12 volunteers {{in the form of}} nose <b>drops</b> <b>or</b> nasal <b>spray</b> four times at weekly intervals, with a fifth dose 5 months later. Each nasal dose consisted of 250 mg of protein, equivalent to 10 times the intramuscular dose that was administered twice with a 6 -week interval to 11 other volunteers. All individuals given the nasal vaccine developed immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibody responses to OMVs in nasal secretions, and eight developed salivary IgA antibodies which persisted for at least 5 months. Intramuscular immunizations did not lead to antibody responses in the secretions. Modest increases in serum IgG antibodies were obtained in 5 volunteers who had been immunized intranasally, while 10 individuals responded strongly to the intramuscular vaccine. Both the serum and secretory antibody responses reached a maximum after two to three doses of the nasal vaccine, with no significant booster effect of the fifth dose. The pattern of serum antibody specificities against the different OMV components after intranasal immunizations was largely similar to that obtained with the intramuscular vaccine. Five and eight vaccinees in the nasal group developed persistent increases in serum bactericidal titers to the homologous meningococcal vaccine strain expressing low and high levels, respectively, of the outer membrane protein Opc. Our results indicate that meningococcal OMVs possess the structures necessary to initiate systemic as well as local mucosal immune responses when presented as a nasa...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiments}} in which {{transmission of the}} disease was attempted by flies hardly parallel the observations within the herd. It is not unusual to observe large numbers of flies feeding on the exudate. Slight disturbances may interrupt feeding and cause the flies to disperse and within a short period alight about the eyes of other cows. The experiments, however, bring {{out the fact that}} the bacterium will not remain viable for even a few minutes in the digestive tract of the fly. Its life on the external surfaces of the fly is extremely short and in our observations has not exceeded 3 hours. The latter fact strengthens the opinion that in the main the infection is not dust-borne since the bacterium soon dies when not in contact with the eye. Two other points are of considerable significance. The ability of the organism to maintain itself on the eye for considerable periods after the acute symptoms have subsided may explain the reappearance of cases during the warmer months. The organism can exist in the eye throughout the winter and with the warm weather flies may transmit it to other susceptible individuals and thus a nucleus of an epidemic may be established. The presence of the organism in the nasal passages in the incubation stage and early in the disease in two of our experimental animals affords an explanation for the appearance of the disease in sporadic cases in the colder months. It is assumed that nasal exudate as a fine spray may be forcibly expelled and directly reach the eyeball of a normal individual. It has been shown that small quantities of culture sprayed on the cornea are capable of giving rise to the characteristic disease. The irregularity of the elimination of the organism through the nostril may be explained by the effect of inflammation on the tear duct. In experimental cases a small quantity of bouillon containing the culture was <b>dropped</b> <b>or</b> <b>sprayed</b> on the cornea. Doubtless the bacilli are deposited on the mucosa of the tear duct. Here they may multiply and set up an inflammation and thus gain access to the nasal passage. To what degree the virus is spread by the forcible expulsion of nasal secretion containing lacrimal fluid cannot be determined. The elimination of the bacilli from the nasal passage in our experimental inoculations leads us to believe that in the main the phenomenon is associated with early infections. The examination of the nasal passages {{of a large number of}} well established cases with negative findings tends to corroborate this view. Of interest to those concerned with the treatment of animal diseases is the readiness with which the inflammation subsides when treated with 1 : 40 zinc sulfate...|$|R
40|$|Background: Published {{randomized}} controlled trials (RCTs) on {{the efficacy of}} intranasal corticosteroid (INCS) in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) use either nasal delivery (nasal <b>drop</b> <b>or</b> nasal <b>spray)</b> <b>or</b> sinus delivery (sinus catheter or sinus irrigation) in patients with or without sinus surgery. This influences topical drug delivery and distribution. The effect of these factors on the published results of RCTs is assessed. This systematic review explores the strength of evidence supporting the influence of sinus surgery and delivery methods {{on the effectiveness of}} topical steroids in studies for CRS with meta-analyses. Methods: A systematic review was conducted of RCTs comparing INCS with either placebo or no intervention for treating CRS. Data were extracted for meta-analysis and subgroup analyses by sinus surgery status and topical delivery methods. Results: Forty-eight studies (3961 patients) met the inclusion criteria. INCS improved overall symptoms (standardized mean difference [SMD], - 0. 49; p < 0. 00001) and the proportion of responders (risk ratio [RR], 0. 59; p < 0. 00001) compared with placebo. It decreased nasal polyp size with a greater proportion of responders (RR, 0. 48; p < 0. 00001) and prevented polyp recurrence (RR, 0. 59; p = 0. 0004) compared with placebo. Reduction of polyp size was greater in patients with sinus surgery (RR, 0. 31; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 20, 0. 48) than those without (RR, 0. 61; 95 % CI, 0. 46, 0. 81; p = 0. 009). Greater symptom improvement occurred when sinus delivery methods (SMD, - 1. 32; 95 % CI, - 2. 26, - 0. 38) were compared with nasal delivery methods (SMD, - 0. 38; 95 % CI, - 0. 55, - 0. 22; p < 0. 00001). Conclusion: INCS is effective for CRS. Prior sinus surgery and direct sinus delivery enhance the effectiveness of INCS in CRS. 13 page(s...|$|R
