5|$|The {{high regard}} with which The Invincibles {{are held in}} the annals of Australian and world cricket is {{reflected}} in the various honours accorded to the players. Bradman, Lindwall and Miller were among the ten inaugural inductees into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 1996. Hassett, Morris and Harvey were later inducted, so that 20% of the inductees are from the 1948 team. Of these six, all except Hassett were selected in Australia's Team of the Century, with Bradman as captain and Miller his deputy. Bradman, Lindwall, Miller and Harvey are among a group of only 14 Australians in a total of 60 players who have been inducted into the International Cricket Council's Hall of Fame. In The Ten Greatest Test Teams by Tom Graveney with Norman Miller ten teams were compared by a computer and the 1948 Australians emerged second behind the 1984 West Indians. Graveney strongly disagreed with the result, writing 'there has not been a better team <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>lifetime</b> than Don Bradman's Australian tourists of 1948'. The computer regarded Sam Loxton {{as a member of the}} team as he played more Tests in the series than Neil Harvey, if Harvey had been picked the Australians would have been the superior team.|$|E
