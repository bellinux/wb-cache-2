I can see all of my super fans in the audience when I'm performing because they're doing the choreography harder than me. Some of the fans were like, 'B, you better put me in this DVD.'

Actress Karen Kahn portrayed the young Korean lover of Major Frank Hallsworth in the film. In a subsequent interview with The Press Democrat, Kahn said of the film: [...] "It was supposed to be this Gone with the Wind. And it was the worst movie.

When Chen was about six months old, he lost his sight due to a fever that destroyed his optical nerves. In an interview for the New York Review of Books, Chen said that although his family did not identify with an organized religion, his upbringing was informed by a [...] "traditional belief in virtue that’s present in Chinese culture—that might have some Buddhist content, but not necessarily that one believes in Buddhism." [...] His village was poor, with many families living at a subsistence level. [...] "When I went to school I’d be happy if <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> enough to eat," [...] he recalled.|$|E

The dance sequences in the video were choreographed by Nadine [...] "Hi-Hat" [...] Ruffin, and are said to incorporate ballet, popping and locking, tribal dance and moves {{similar to the ones}} in the eighties drama Flashdance. Talking about her dancing in the video, Shakira said, [...] "I start doing all kinds of outrageous stuff and hanging upside down and doing stuff that wasn't planned. But it was kind of an improvisation. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> caught in the moment." [...] The music video premiered on 30 July 2009, on MTV and was made available for download on iTunes a day later on 31 July. The video for the Spanish-language translation [...] "Loba" [...] was released on the same day.|$|E

It was like, 'Just let me at it and roll those cameras'. I {{remember}} being in makeup for 20 minutes, which normally took two hours. They put some kind of gel in my hair and some very light makeup and I loved it. I said, [...] "Just let me go, please don't edit me, just let me go.'"

500|$|According to Ragan, who was {{involved}} in the race's largest accident, [...] "Everybody was real racy and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> into the back of Menard. You get a good run, and you're pushing a little bit, and I guess he was pushing whoever was in front of him. And when you've got the meat in between the sandwich, you usually get wrecked." [...] Harvick blamed the accident on drivers who had little experience of pack racing: [...] "The biggest problem is the tandem racing has been so easy for these guys to stay attached that some of them haven't raced in pack racing. It's {{going to take a lot}} more patience from a lot of guys who haven't done this before." [...] Nevertheless, Menard thought that the pack style of racing would be a good combination for the Daytona 500 and believed it would be [...] "chaotic" [...] and [...] "exciting". Four days after the race, NASCAR announced that the pressure relief values in the engine would be increased from [...] to [...] after some drivers complained of overheating issues while they were running in packs. The race had a television audience of 7.46million viewers.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the sheet}} music, {{published}} on Musicnotes.com by BMG Music, shows [...] "Ain't No Other Man" [...] {{in the key}} of F minor, the recording suggests it is approximately in F♯ minor, perhaps due to a speed discrepancy. The song has a moderate fast tempo of 132 beats per minute. Aguilera's vocal range on the track spans from A♭3 to F♯5. Dorian Lyskey of The Guardian noted that the beats of the song are [...] "brassy" [...] and have the same [...] "aerobic oomph" [...] as Beyoncé's [...] "Crazy in Love", while Jody Rosen from Entertainment Weekly deemed the track [...] "exhilarating". According to Aguilera; lyrically, [...] "Ain't No Other Man" [...] is not a love song, but actually intertwines with the events that she experienced in real life. The song seems to be about Aguilera's husband, Jordan Bratman, but is really simply about feeling good. During an interview with MTV News, Aguilera said of the song, [...] "I {{wanted to make it}} light and easy for people to dance to and sing along to... Lyrically, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> married, so it's about someone in particular, but it's all about feeling good and not taking anything too seriously".|$|E

500|$|Although Winona Ryder was {{the first}} cast member {{attached}} to the script, Dianne Wiest {{was the first}} to sign on. [...] "Dianne, in particular, was wonderful", Burton said. [...] "She was the first actress to read the script, supported it completely and, because she is so respected, once she had given it her stamp of approval, others soon got interested". When it came to casting the lead role of Edward, several actors were considered; Fox was insistent on having Burton meet with Tom Cruise. [...] "He certainly wasn't my ideal, but I talked to him", Burton remembered. [...] "He was interesting, but I think it worked out for the best. A lot of questions came up". Cruise asked for a [...] "happier" [...] ending. Gary Oldman and Tom Hanks turned down the part, the latter in favor of critical and commercial flop The Bonfire of the Vanities. Oldman declined as he found the story absurd, but said of the finished film: [...] "Literally two minutes in, I went, 'Yeah, I get it'. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> it too late." [...] Jim Carrey was also considered for the role, while Thompson favored John Cusack. Elsewhere, William Hurt, Robert Downey Jr. and musician Michael Jackson expressed interest, although Burton neglected to converse with Jackson.|$|E
500|$|Jennings' work on In Search of America and the September 11 attacks {{contributed to}} his {{decision}} in 2003 to become a dual citizen of Canada and the United States. [...] "I think that 9/11 and the subsequent travel I did in the country afterwards made me feel connected in new ways," [...] he said. [...] "And when {{we were working on}} the America project I {{spent a lot of time}} on the road, which meant away from my editor's desk, and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> much more connected to the Founding Fathers' dreams and ideas for the future." [...] His work had prepared him well for the citizenship test, which he passed easily. [...] "Can you imagine I, who just finished a whole series on America and had been an anchorperson for an American broadcast...could you imagine if I had failed?" [...] he asked. [...] "It would have been horrendous." [...] The anchor's formal pledge of allegiance took place at a regular citizenship ceremony on May 30 in Lower Manhattan. The occasion overwhelmed him. [...] "I went in the front door and came out the front door. They were regular people. They were very touching. And I cried a little bit — my kids didn't cry, but I cried a bit — but I'm a fairly emotional character anyway." ...|$|E
500|$|Andrew Garfield {{was given}} the role of Tommy, a well-meaning, rather dim young person who struggles {{to find a place}} in an {{environment}} which values imagination and creativity above all. He said of his character, [...] "There's a sense of anxiety that runs through these kids, especially Tommy, because he's so sensory and feeling and animalistic, that's my perspective of him." [...] Garfield was attracted to the film based on the existential questions the story expresses. He called the experience of being a part of Never Let Me Go a [...] "dream to come true". Garfield enjoys an opportunity to let loose with his roles. He said the scenes in which his character—unable to contain his frustration—erupts with a wail, was [...] "intense" [...] for him. [...] "I think those screams are inside all of us, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> a chance to let mine out". Before shooting the film, he had read the screenplay and the book. In March 2009 Daily Variety reported that Knightley was signed to the project. Knightley admitted that she only agreed to appear in Never Let Me Go because co-star and friend Mulligan had asked her to. She portrays Ruth, a zealous, ambitious character who behaves manipulatively out of inner insecurity. When asked what she did and did not have in common with her character, Knightley said she was unable to relate to Ruth's situation of being involved in a love triangle.|$|E

[...] "I think those screams are inside all of us, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> a chance to let mine out". For his portrayal of a well-meaning, but dim young man caught in a love triangle, he won the 2010 Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor. Cleveland Magazine Clint O'Connor lauded his performance, commenting that Garfield delivered [...] "a terrifically anguished performance" [...] in the film. Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman praised the performances of the lead cast, reflecting that [...] "these three all act with a spooky, haunted innocence that gets under your skin." [...] Tom Preston, a critic from The Guardian, further described Garfield's acting as solid and [...] "at times deeply moving". In comparison to Mulligan and Knightley, Scott Bowles, writing for USA Today, deemed Garfield [...] "the real find" [...] of Never Let Me Go.|$|E

While running close to the lead and leading a couple laps, Edwards tangled with Kasey Kahne with less than 20 laps to go. Edwards — while moving under Kahne —knocked Kahne into the SAFER barrier. In an apparent act of retaliation, Kahne forced Edwards out of the draft, wrecking Edwards and himself. Despite the payback, Edwards took responsibility for the collision stating: [...] "I was just racing as hard as I can. It's completely my fault, Kasey did a good job. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> sucked up into him there off of turn 4 and tore up the right side a little bit and got loose into Turn 1 and that was it. ...
