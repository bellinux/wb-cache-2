Tested were four multi-meter type instruments which use the UI method to determine resistance and three <b>resistance</b> <b>bridges</b> that measure <b>resistance</b> as a ratio between a resistance thermometer and a standard resistor. The device {{used to measure the}} nonlinearity of the instruments was a RBC 100 <b>resistance</b> <b>bridge</b> calibrator. The device is a passive four resistor matrix that enables for 35 different resistances to be generated by parallel/series switching of the four base resistors. The device had been previously automated for easier use [6]. This eliminates the need for an operator to be present during calibration, the device can also be placed in an thermally stable enclosure and switched from within it. The software that was purposely developed for the automated work with the RBC 100 controls both the calibrator as well as gathers measurements from the instrument under test. The software also calculates non-linearity and keeps record of the measurements that were performed. During testing, two rounds of measurement sets were performed. During each round 3 sets of all 35 combinations were measured on every instrument under test. The multimeter type instruments nonlinearity was measured to be far lower than the declared uncertainty. The linearities of the <b>resistance</b> <b>bridges</b> were in most cases equal to the declared uncertainty value.

40|$|Abstract − This paper {{analyses}} {{the influence}} of interference from non-ideal laboratory environment on the resistance-bridge operation. Interference can be either the result of thermal emf, electromagnetically induced voltage or harmonic distortion of the power supply voltage. Interference is manifested as the increased measurement dispersion or even as non-negligible change in the measured resistance. Thermal emf is the voltage generated by the temperature gradients on junctions of different metals. <b>Resistance</b> <b>bridges</b> are cancelling this effect by using either alternating current or DC current reversal. Electromagnetic interference is air transmitted interference that generates induced voltage in the thermometer, connecting cables and/or bridge circuits. This effect results not only in unstable bridge operation and increased noise, but can also produce an offset in bridge readings. Ideally, AC power supply voltage would be pure sine with constant frequency, phase and amplitude, but in practice it is often distorted. Higher order harmonics and/or subharmonics may interfere with the bridge operation. Experiments with interference sources were conducted on the DC <b>resistance</b> <b>bridge</b> MI 6010 and the AC <b>resistance</b> <b>bridge</b> ASL F 900.
