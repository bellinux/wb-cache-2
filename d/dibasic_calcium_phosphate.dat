Statistically significant differences were found among the drug release profile from different classes of polymeric matrices. Higher polymeric content (40 %) in the matrix decreased the release rate of drug because of increased tortuosity and decreased porosity.

This investigation outlines methods used to evaluate various tablet parameters using NIRS and the achievement of successful predictions of those parameters. NIR models for tablet hardness and density were developed for 15 % and 20 % hydrochlorothiazide and 2 % and 6 % chlorpheniramine maleate in a 0. 5 % magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose matrix.

Although the NIR response to changing hardness was the same regardless of the drug, separate models were required for tablets of different geometries.
