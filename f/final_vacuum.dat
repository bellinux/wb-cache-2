40|$|This is {{the last}} of three papers on Conformal General Relativity (CGR), which ascribes {{inflation}} to a spontaneous breakdown of conformal symmetry, followed by a sudden energy transfer from geometry to matter identified as big bang. This process is driven by a conformal-invariant, unitarity-preserving interaction of two Nambu-Goldstone fields: a ghost scalar field σ, invested with geometric meaning, and a physical scalar field φ behaving like a Higgs field of varying mass. The big bang generates a bulk of Higgs bosons at temperature T_B≃ 141 GeV, after which the universe evolves adiabatically while the Higgs bosons decay into Standard-Model particles and the magnitude of the gravitational coupling constant decreases. The process ends when the σ-φ interaction potential vanishes, the amplitudes of these fields converge to their expectation values in a <b>final</b> stable <b>vacuum</b> and the Higgs-boson mass converges to about 126 GeV. The main aspects of this phenomenology are qualitatively described and accurately exemplified by numerical simulations.

Pressure {{processes are}} those in which the treatment is carried out in closed cylinders with applied pressure or vacuum. These processes {{have a number of}} advantages over the non-pressure methods. In most cases, a deeper and more uniform penetration and a higher absorption of preservative is achieved. Another advantage is that the treating conditions can be controlled so that retention and penetration can be varied. These pressure processes can be adapted to large-scale production. The high initial costs for equipment and the energy costs are the biggest disadvantages. These treatment methods are used to protect ties, poles and structural timbers and find use throughout the world today. The various pressure processes that are used today differ in details, but the general method is in all cases the same. The treatment is carried out in cylinders.

VI mono power amplifier of 1976, which produced 120 watts (continuous). [...] In later years, the company began to produce a line of solid-state audio components, commencing in 1966 with the introduction of the Stereo 120 power amplifier (60 wpc). Because of early problems involving circuit, power supply, and transistor failures, the ST 120 was not as popular as earlier Dynaco tube amplifiers. Numerous small circuit changes were introduced by Dynaco over the years in an attempt to improve the stability and reliability of the ST 120, without much success. With the PAT-4 preamplifier in 1967, the company affirmed its ability to design reliable solid state equipment at an affordable price. In the 1970s, the Stereo 400 was developed and marketed. This was a high power amplifier at 200 watts per channel that offered automatic protection circuitry to prevent electrical destruction of the loudspeaker. The FM-5 tuner was offered as was the SCA-80 integrated amplifier in the early 1970s time line. There was also the Dynaquad system which allowed the user to simulate a quadrophonic sound by using out of phase signals at the speaker terminals. It apparently was a success and offered good four-channel sound at budget price. Dynaco's solid-state kits were different from the popular Heathkit products (and Dynaco's own vacuum tube kits) because of their preassembled circuit boards. These boards were wired at the factory, tested and packaged with the unassembled chassis. It remained only for the consumer to attach the switches and controls to the chassis pieces, assemble the chassis and power supply, and solder connecting wires to the circuit boards. This saved considerable time and reduced error in assembly.|$|R
