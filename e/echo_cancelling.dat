40|$|Asymmetric digital {{subscriber}} lines (ADSLs) employ discrete multitone modulation (DMT) as transmission format, where subcarriers {{are assigned to}} the up- and/or downstream transmission direction. To separate up- and downstream signals, the ADSL standard allows the use of echo cancellation resulting in improved bit rates, reach, and/or noise margins. In DMT-based modems, typically, the mixed time/frequency (MTF) domain <b>echo</b> <b>canceling</b> scheme, as proposed by Ho et al., is implemented. This technique estimates the echo filter in the frequency domain using the least mean square (LMS) algorithm with the transmitted echo symbols as update directions. Since not every tone of the transmitted echo signal will carry data, i. e., will be excited, the MTF adaptation process {{does not lead to}} a good estimate for the echo channel, unless extra power on unused echo tones is transmitted. However, transmitting extra power on such tones is often undesired. In this paper, we present an alternative <b>echo</b> <b>canceling</b> scheme referred to as the circulant decomposition canceler (CDC), which works without extra power requirements and with comparable complexity as the method of Ho et al. Similar to MTF <b>echo</b> <b>canceling,</b> the CDC scheme can easily be incorporated into a multirate environment with different transmit and receive rates and can also cheaply be combined with per-tone equalization and double talk cancellation to allow fast tracking and/or convergence {{in the presence of a}} far-end signal. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{existing}} ADSL standard {{allows for}} two possible trans-mission systems: {{frequency division duplexing}} (FDD) and <b>echo</b> <b>cancelling</b> (EC). <b>Echo</b> <b>cancelling</b> is particularly attrac-tive {{for its ability to}} achieve higher data rates compared with FDD schemes. A disadvantage of EC is that adaptive schemes exhibit slow tracking properties {{in the presence of a}} far end signal or double talker. This paper presents an efcient method for updating echo canceller taps in ADSL transceivers in the presence of a far end signal, by effectively cancelling most of the received far end energy. The pre-sented scheme extends existing multicarrier <b>echo</b> <b>cancelling</b> schemes with a feedback of decisions on the far end signal.

40|$|In the <b>echo</b> <b>canceling</b> for hand-free set mobile {{radiotelephone}} or teleconference system, the double-talk is {{occurred when}} both the near-end and the far-end speakers talk simultaneously. The conventional adaptive digital FIR filter using algorithm such as LMS fails {{to track the}} echo path in this condition. Because the error signal is contaminated to the near-end signal to estimate the gradient correctly. The Extended Correlation LMS (ECLMS) algorithm has been introduced by authors to challenge the double-talk in the <b>echo</b> <b>canceling</b> system. Here, the gradient search algorithm is obtained from the correlation function and the error lags between autocorrelation and cross-correlation values of the near and the far end signals. To reduce the computational load of the ECLMS algorithm, the frequency domain version of the algorithm has also previously been defined by the authors but the performance was not appropriate. In this paper, to implement the exact linear convolution in the frequency domain a new fast implementation of the ECLMS algorithm by using zero padding and Half Overlapped Save (HOS) method has been proposed.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel stereophonic acoustic <b>echo</b> <b>canceling</b> scheme.

The two states generate two solution sets, of which the intersection is expected to be fairly small and to contain the true impulse response of echo paths. The POWER technique and the simultaneous use of the inputs find a good direction to the intersection, realizing thus fast convergence. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly improves the convergence behavior compared with conventional methods in system mismatch (i. e., normalized coefficients error) and Echo Return Loss Enhancement (ERLE). 1...|$|R

40|$|The two-path {{algorithm}} {{is a well-known}} approach for overcoming the dead-lock problem in echo cancellation systems. Typically, a fixed foreground filter is producing the <b>echo</b> <b>cancelled</b> output while a continuously updating background filter adapts to the echo-path. When the background filter is considered to perform better than the foreground filter, the coefficients of the background filter are copied into the foreground filter. To determine which filter is better adjusted to the true echo-path, a filter deviation measure can be used. Recently, a method which introduces a delay in the calculation of the filter deviation measure, yielding a more reliable estimate has been proposed. However, a thorough evaluation {{of the effect of}} different delay settings has not yet been performed. Thus, in this paper a number of simulations with different delay parameter settings are carried out to show how this parameter affects the overall performance of the filter deviation measure...|$|R

A calibrating scheme is proposed which is independent of array geometry and channel matching, and which calibrates the adaptive array to the given acoustic environment and to the given electronic equipment. Results from real measurements in a car interior are included and compared with an analytical description of an adaptive microphone array.

40|$|The {{increasing}} use {{of modern}} hands free communication systems such as video conferencing, computer communications, and vehicle mounted cellular telephones brings the demand for high-quality acoustic echo cancellation up to focus. In these applications the echo path which has to be identified typically has long time duration, the order of 100 ms. For this identification {{the length of the}} filter will be long. This report evaluates the Normalized Least Mean Square (NLMS) and the Weighted Recursive Least Square (WRLS) algorithms for acoustic <b>echo</b> <b>cancelling</b> using a delayless subband scheme. Subband signal processing has shown to be efficient both when it comes to convergence rate and level of echo suppression. The evaluation is performed for real speech signals sampled from a conversation using a hands free set mounted in an automobile, and a conversation using conference telephony equipment in a conference room. A comparison of subband and fullband algorithms is made both with respect to the computational cost and level of echo suppression. Results show that when the impulse response is very long, i. e. in such environments as conference rooms, the subband approach is beneficial. In a car environment the size of enclosure and damping means that the response is quite short and a conventional echo canceller could perform as well as a subband echo canceller.

Due to the inherent non-linear method of velocity estimation, it is most appropriate to state a probability of correct detection at low signal-to-noise ratios.

With a total of 16 calls, the data rate was approximately 500 kbit/s, which proved that the bandwidth of the mesh was quite lightly loaded. However, speech packets were rather short.

40|$|VoIP calls {{frequently}} {{suffer from}} echoes which degrade {{the quality of}} voice transmissions. Traditional methods of using adaptive filters to cancel line echoes over the {{public switched telephone network}} are not as effective when applied to VoIP channels. This is because VoIP echo paths are generally longer due to longer network delays and non-stationary due to dynamic de-jitter buffering. Also, non-linearities introduced by dropped packets and lossy signal compression algorithms can reduce the performance of the adaptive filters. This project researched the theory of digital adaptive filter algorithms and their application to the echo cancellation problem in VoIP networks. A VoIP, adaptive echo cancellation (AEC) simulation was designed and then implemented in MATLAB. The simulation modeled an echo path which incorporated VoIP channel characteristics and room acoustic effects. The simulation was used to test the <b>echo</b> <b>cancelling</b> effectiveness of three different adaptive algorithm schemes: a normalised least mean squares (NLMS) filter, a NLMS filter in Dual-H configuration and a recursive least squares (RLS) filter. Echo cancellation performance was primarily determined by measuring the loudness of echoes before and after they enter the system (represented by an ERLE value). The Telecommunication Standardization Sector of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU-T) G. 131 echo objection rate gives the recommended echo attenuation levels required by an echo canceller. The Dual-H NLMS AEC system designed in this project achieved an ERLE of approximately 35 dB during simulations in the VoIP environment which is above the ITU-T recommended level. This showed that satisfactory echo cancellation performance in a VoIP environment could be achieved by the use of this relatively simple AEC system. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of five parts, {{each of which}} considers methods based on filter banks for different applications in signal and image processing. In Part I, a non-parametric estimation method is proposed using filter banks to estimate signals with varying waveforms and arrival times. This method, which provides a linear, robust estimate of the signal, {{is based on a}} series expansion by a set of basis functions. Using a uniform and a non-uniform filter bank, the method is applied to estimation of an event-related signal. In Part II, a time-frequency distribution method for the analysis and synthesis of non-stationary signals is presented, incorporating a filter bank and the Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD). This method gives a representation of a signal in the time-frequency plane that suppresses the cross-terms and noise of the WVD, while retaining high energy concentration of the signal. Part III introduces an image enhancement method based on nonlinear multiscale reconstruction. By using a 2 D-filter bank with a pyramidal scheme and different types of edge detectors, it is shown that the presented image enhancement method not only reduces noise, but also preserves the sharpness of edges. Part IV presents the design and application of a multirate digital filter bank. The impulse response of a system is estimated and multi-channel <b>echo</b> <b>cancelling</b> is performed employing multirate operations through decimation and interpolation. The presented approach is expected to yield high echo suppression and fast convergence for the filter weight adaptation by means of multirate parallel processing of the filter bank. In Part V, the detection of transient signals using filter banks and higher-order statistics (cumulants) is studied. It is shown that the use of the higher- order cumulants with a filter bank can be effective for the detection purpose...|$|E
40|$|Adaptive Projected Subgradient Method (APSM) {{serves as}} a uni-fied guiding {{principle}} of various set-theoretic adaptive filtering al-gorithms including NLMS/APA. APSM asymptotically minimizes a sequence of non-negative convex functions in a real-Hilbert space.

In this paper, we first clarify that ESP is derived by APSM in a real Hilbert space with a special inner product. This gives us an interesting interpretation that ESP is based on iterative projections onto the same convex sets as APA with a special metric. We can thus expect that a proper choice of metric will lead to improvement of convergence speed. We then propose an efficient adaptive al-gorithm named adaptive quadratic-metric parallel subgradient pro-jection (AQ-PSP).

40|$|Abstract—During the {{experimental}} data processing, {{we find that}} corner reflectors cannot be focused properly using 3 -D SAR with a moving transmitter due to the phase reversal phenomenon based on the phase history analysis, i. e., the phases at different observation angles might shift rad, and the <b>echoes</b> <b>cancel,</b> rather than accumulate, to each other. To overcome this defect, 3 -D SAR with fixed transmitter is designed. Since the geometry of the transmitter and targets remains unchanged during the observation session, the coherence of echoes is well preserved. The mechanism of 3 -D SAR with fixed transmitter can accurately be explained using the Stratton-Chu equation. For perfect conductor, the 3 -D image {{is related to the}} electric current density. For general dielectric medium, the 3 -D image is related to the electric current density, magnetic current density and directional vector of scatterer.
