For each junction box (<b>J-box)</b> designation {{there is a}} schematic of the <b>J-box</b> disconnect harness instrumentation worksheets which show sensor location, and calibration data sheets for each sensor associated with that <b>J-box.</b> An index of measurement item codes to <b>J-box</b> locations is given in a table.

40|$|Engineering robust {{adhesion}} of the junction-box (<b>j-box)</b> is a hurdle typically {{encountered by}} photovoltaic (PV) module manufacturers during product development. Furthermore, there are historical incidences of adverse effects (e. g., fires) caused when the j-box/adhesive/module system has {{failed in the}} field. The addition of a weight to the <b>j-box</b> during the 'damp heat' IEC qualification test is proposed to verify the basic robustness of the <b>j-box</b> adhesion system. The details of the proposed test are described, {{in addition to the}} preliminary results conducted using representative materials and components...|$|E
40|$|The {{study group}} was {{presented}} {{with the problem of}} determining the behaviour of a web of wet cellulose fibres - called a tow - as it passes through part of the manufacturing process. The name of the problem derives from the fact that on its passage down the production line the tow passes through a J-shaped box, whose purpose is to provide a buffer where the tow is stored long enough and hot enough for certain chemical reactions to take place, mainly concerned with giving the right quality to the fibre surface. (The production line in fact involves two J-boxes, one containing wet tow, the other dry, and we are here entirely concerned with the first of these, the wet <b>J-box.)</b> Three aspects of the tow behaviour were proposed for investigation: 1. What is the mechanical behaviour of the tow within the <b>J-box</b> ? Specifically, how do the time spent within the <b>J-box</b> and the shape of the tow outlet column depend on the J- box geometry, tow density and compressibility, flow rate, friction coefficients etc. 2. What is the temperature history, and hence the chemical history, of the tow within the <b>J-box?</b> 3. Why do dislocations and loops occur within the tow? We first give typical parameters and other details of the process, and then further details of these three questions...|$|E
40|$|Graphical Display Adapter {{provides}} a real time display for digital computerized experiments. This display uses a memory oscilloscope which records a single trace until erased. It {{is a small}} hardware unit which interfaces with the <b>J-box</b> feature of the SDS- 930 computer to either an X-Y plotter or a memory oscilloscope...|$|E
40|$|The cost {{of several}} circuit {{configurations}} for large (5 MW) array fields were investigated {{to assess the}} relative costs {{of high and low}} voltage configurations. Three source circuit NOC voltages were evaluated: 400 V (ungrounded), 800 V (+ or 400 V center grounded), and 2000 V (+ or - 1000 V center grounded). Four source circuit configurations were considered {{for each of the three}} NOC voltages. The configurations correspond to source circuit currents of 15, 30, 45, and 60 amperes, respectively. Conceptual layouts for 5 MW building blocks for each of the above configurations were developed. The designs were optimized to minimize BOS electrical and structural costs. Only the BOS electrical costs were evaluated. The designs were broken down into the following elements for cost: (1) basic source circuit intermodule wiring, bypass diodes and associated hardware, source circuit to <b>J-Box</b> wiring, etc; (2) <b>J-Box</b> blocking diodes, varistors, heat sinks, and housing; (3) disconnects source circuit disconnects, fuses, and housing; (4) bus cabling <b>J-Box</b> to PCU interface wiring, and trenching; (5) interface bus bar, group disconnects, and fuses; and (6) fault detection shunts, signal wire, electronics, and alarm. It is concluded that high voltage low current circuits are not economical, at higher currents high and low voltage circuit costs approach each other, high voltage circuits are not likely to offer near term advantage, and development work/manufacturer stimulation is needed to develop low cost high voltage hardware...|$|E

The details of the proposed test will be described, {{in addition to the}} preliminary results obtained using representative materials and components. The described discovery experiments examine moisture-cured silicone, foam tape, and hot-melt adhesives used in conjunction with PET or glass module 'substrates. ' To be able to interpret the results, a set of material-level characterizations was performed, including thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, and dynamic mechanical analysis. PV j-boxes were adhered to a substrate, loaded with a prescribed weight, and then placed inside an environmental chamber (at 85 C, 85 % relative humidity). Some systems did not remain attached through the discovery experiments. Observed failure modes include delamination (at the j-box/adhesive or adhesive/substrate interface) and phase change/creep. The results are discussed {{in the context of the}} application requirements, in addition to the plan for the formal experiment supporting the proposed modification to the qualification test...|$|E
40|$|Beneath 5, 000 {{meters of}} water midway between Hawaii and California, the Hawaii- 2 Observatory (H 2 O) {{rests on the}} {{seafloor}} (Figure 1). The dream of a deepocean scientific observatory is a reality. Telemetry and power comes via a retired telephone cable—Hawaii- 2 —donated by AT&T to the IRIS Consortium {{for the benefit of}} the scientific community. H 2 O is the first Global Seismographic Network (GSN) station on the seafloor, and with a suite of wet-mateable connectors on a junction box (<b>j-box),</b> offers marine scientists a new opportunity to deploy and operate remote instrumentation in the middle of the ocean. Although Earth is mostly covered by ocean, nearly all of the long-term (> year) geophysical time series have been collected on land. The near-total absence of long-term geophysical data from the seafloor starkly contrasts with the century-long record of land-based seismic and geomagnetic observations. Deployment of instrumentation in the ocean and on and below the seafloor has been limited by the availability of ships, battery capacity, corrosion problems, and data storage...|$|E
