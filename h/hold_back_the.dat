5|$|Breckinridge {{ordered his}} field {{officers}} {{to inspect the}} troops and to report back with the condition of his troops. The number of men wounded and killed had depleted his troops {{to a point that}} he judged that he could no longer <b>hold</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> Union forces at his front lines. Ammunition in the camp was also dwindling; each man had no more than ten cartridges apiece. With their supplies destroyed by Stoneman's troops at the towns of Wytheville and Abingdon, there was little hope of being resupplied or reinforced in the near future.|$|E

5|$|The Conservators {{applied for}} a second act of {{parliament}} in 1707, as they needed a further £3,800 to finance projects including {{the building of a}} half-lock and the removal of a shoal just below Knapp Bridge. Boats carrying 15tons of cargo could reach Taunton by 1717. The navigation included a lock and two or more half-locks, consisting of a pair of gates to <b>hold</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> water, and an agreement to build a towpath between Ham Mills and Taunton was reached in 1724.|$|E

5|$|Although the Song dynasty {{was able}} to <b>hold</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> Jin, a new foe came to power over the steppe, deserts, and plains north of the Jin dynasty. The Mongols, led by Genghis Khan (r. 1206–1227), {{initially}} invaded the Jin dynasty in 1205 and 1209, engaging in large raids across its borders, and in 1211 an enormous Mongol army was assembled to invade the Jin. The Jin dynasty was forced to submit and {{pay tribute to the}} Mongols as vassals; when the Jin suddenly moved their capital city from Beijing to Kaifeng, the Mongols saw this as a revolt. Under the leadership of Ögedei Khan (r.1229–1241), both the Jin dynasty and Western Xia dynasty were conquered by Mongol forces. The Mongols also invaded Korea, the Abbasid Caliphate of the Middle East and the Kievan Rus'.|$|E
5|$|Agents Edgar Ross (Jim Bentley) and Archer Fordham (David Wilson Barnes) {{refuse to}} let Marston {{return to his}} family until he assists the Bureau in hunting down Dutch van der Linde (Benjamin Byron Davis), the leader of Marston's former gang. Marston learns that Dutch has been forming his own gang, and joins Ross, Fordham {{and a group of}} U.S. {{soldiers}} in an attack on Dutch's hideout. During the assault, Marston chases Dutch up to a cliff, where the latter commits suicide by backing off the cliff and falling to his death. Marston is released from his deal with Ross and returns to his ranch where his wife Abigail (Sophie Marzocchi) and son Jack (Josh Blaylock) are waiting. Marston devotes his time tending to the ranch, having sworn to keep himself and his family away from the outlaw lifestyle forever. He is then suddenly forced to repel a surprise attack from a combined force of soldiers, lawmen and government agents led by Ross. Marston is able to fend off several waves of attackers and get his family to safety but stays behind to <b>hold</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> rest. Despite a valiant last stand, he dies after being shot numerous times by Ross and his men, and is buried by his family on the hill overlooking the ranch.|$|E
5|$|Born in Tokyo to British parents, deHavilland and {{her younger}} sister Joan moved with their mother to California in 1919. They were brought up by their mother Lilian, a former stage actress who taught them drama, music, and elocution. De Havilland made her acting debut in amateur theatre in Alice in Wonderland. Later, she {{appeared}} in a local production of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, which led to her playing Hermia in Max Reinhardt's stage production of the play and a movie contract with Warner Bros. Olivia deHavilland made her screen debut in Reinhardt's A Midsummer Night's Dream in 1935. Her career playing demure ingénues opposite popular leading men, including Errol Flynn, with whom she made nine films. They became one of Hollywood's most popular romantic on-screen pairings. She achieved her initial popularity in romantic comedy films, such as The Great Garrick (1937), and in Westerns, such as Dodge City (1939). Her natural beauty and refined acting style made her particularly effective in historical period dramas, such as Anthony Adverse (1936), and romantic dramas, such as <b>Hold</b> <b>Back</b> <b>the</b> Dawn (1941). In her later career, she was most successful in dramas, such as Light in the Piazza (1962), and unglamorous roles in psychological dramas including Hush… Hush, Sweet Charlotte (1964).|$|E

5|$|Landward {{movement}} of the shingle meant that the channel of the Glaven was becoming blocked increasingly often by 2004. This led to flooding of Cley village and the environmentally important Blakeney freshwater marshes. The Environment Agency considered several remedial options. It concluded that attempting to <b>hold</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> shingle or breaching the spit {{to create a new}} outlet for the Glaven would be expensive and probably ineffective, and doing nothing would be environmentally damaging. The Agency decided to create a new route for the river to the south of its original line, and work to realign a 550m (600yd) stretch of river 200m (220yd) further south was completed in 2007 {{at a cost of about}} £1.5million. The Glaven had previously been realigned from an earlier, more northerly, course in 1922. The ruins of Blakeney Chapel are now to the north of the river embankment, and essentially unprotected from coastal erosion, since the advancing shingle will no longer be swept away by the stream. The chapel will be buried by a ridge of shingle as the spit continues to move south, and then lost to the sea, perhaps within 20–30years.|$|E

5|$|News of the {{invasion}} quickly spread around the world via ambassadors and correspondents in Korea. Journalists in the United States were reporting on {{the invasion}} within five hours of the initial attack, and United States Ambassador to Korea John J. Muccio sent a telegram to the US State Department at 21:26 EST (10:26 KST) June 24. As the combat grew more intense, US Secretary of State Dean Acheson informed US President Harry S. Truman (who had been resting {{at his home in}} Independence, Missouri for the weekend), and Secretary-General of the United Nations Trygve Lie of the situation. The attack was particularly troubling to Truman, who likened it to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and to Lie, who was reminded of the Invasion of Norway during World War II. Fearing the attack would spur a World War III, Truman resolved to act as quickly as possible to prevent an escalation of the conflict. Muccio met with Rhee, who informed him the South Korean Army would run out of ammunition within ten days, and {{would not be able to}} <b>hold</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> invasion on its own.

5|$|On November 3, Sheriff Porttens deputized {{two hundred}} men and they {{marched to the}} {{terminal}} building where they attempted to assist the strikebreakers in moving the streetcars from the street and vulnerable terminal building to the more easily protected carhouse across the street. Todd led the strikebeakers in the effort while the police provided protection. The police were able to <b>hold</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> crowd at first, using clubs to hit anyone who attempted to interfere. The rioters increased the intensity of their attack, and men on the rooftops began throwing stones and bricks. Todd was hit multiple times and {{was rushed to the}} hospital with severe injuries. The greatly outnumbered police began to abandon their posts and the strikebreakers fled into the storage buildings. People in the crowd opened fire on a storage building and killed one of the strikebreakers and injured others. By the end of November 3, after two days of protecting the cars, less than fifty policemen remained on duty in the city. Meanwhile, the strike degenerated into a riot encompassing the entire downtown.|$|E
5|$|The first {{operation}} {{involving the}} 6th Airlanding Brigade followed two attacks by the Palmach on coastguard stations over {{the night of}} 24/25November. Palestine Police Force dogs tracked the attackers to the settlements of Rishpon and Sidna Ali. In the following cordon and search operation, the police were stoned by the inhabitants, and the soldiers on the cordon had to prevent reinforcements from other settlements reaching the villages. The next day, 26November, the police were involved in hand-to-hand fighting with the villagers and eventually withdrew, calling on the brigade to enter the settlements and enforce law and order. Leaving some men behind on the cordon to <b>hold</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> estimated 3,000 crowd, {{the remainder of the}} brigade entered the settlements. Here they carried out several baton charges {{and for the first time}} used tear gas to disperse the crowds. In the cleanup operation, 900 persons were later arrested.|$|E
5|$|The next attack {{took place}} on 20 July as part of Operation Atlantic. It was led by the South Saskatchewan Regiment, with {{supporting}} units from the Cameron Highlanders. In {{the early hours of}} 20 July, the Highlanders secured a position in St André-sur-Orne but were quickly pinned down by German infantry and tanks. At the same time, the South Saskatchewan Regiment moved directly up the slopes of Verrières Ridge, supported by tanks and Hawker Typhoon ground attack aircraft. The Canadian attack faltered in torrential rain, which rendered air support useless and turned the ground into mud. Counterattacks by two Panzer divisions threw the South Saskatchewans back past their support lines and their supporting battalion—the Essex Scottish—came under attack. The Essex Scottish lost over 300 men as it tried to <b>hold</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> advance of the 12th SS Panzer Division, while to the east the remainder of I SS Panzer Corps engaged British forces in the Operation Goodwood, the largest armoured battle of the campaign.

5|$|Walker had protested in vain against {{releasing}} the brigade, believing {{he needed it}} and all the troops then in Korea {{if he were to}} stop the North Korean offensive against the Pusan Perimeter. The order prompted a heated disagreement between Walker's command and MacArthur's command. Walker said he could not hold the Pusan Perimeter without the Marines in reserve, while MacArthur said he could not conduct the Inchon landings without the Marines. MacArthur responded by assigning two newly arrived units of the 3rd Infantry Division, the 17th Infantry Regiment and the 65th Infantry Regiment to Walker's reserves. Walker did not feel the inexperienced troops would be effective, and believed the transition endangered the Pusan Perimeter {{at a time when it}} was unclear if it could <b>hold</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> North Koreans. The brigade moved to Japan and merged with the 1st Marine Division. It was deactivated as an independent unit for the last time on 13 September 1950.|$|E

5|$|A {{dispatch}} {{from the}} Associated Press to Mexico City reported that 20,000 citizens from villages in Durango, Sinaloa, Nayarit, and Jalisco evacuated {{due to the}} threat of flooding and high winds from Naomi. The damage from Naomi in Mexico was moderate, although no monetary figures have ever been released. The Associated Press dispatch also reported that Naomi was responsible for knocking out communications over a large area in Mazatlán as well as downing power lines and damaging houses. At least 2000 people were reported homeless in Durango due to the hurricane. The hurricane also caused damage to Highway 15 between Mazatlán and Tepic. Although the highway reopened soon afterward, some areas that were struck by the hurricane were still rough. Naomi's most notable impact in Mexico involved the Lázaro Cárdenas Dam on the Nazas River, which was not complete by the time the hurricane hit. The dam, upriver from Gómez Palacio and Torreón, was feared to break down from the water being built up behind it, influenced by the hurricane. The two options were to either open the dam, saving Torreón by inundating Gómez Palacio, or risk inundating both towns by keeping the dam closed. The decision was made harder by the fact that, if the dam was released and no rain fell to refill the basin behind the dam, the farms would have insufficient water for agricultural growth. Photography from the Environmental Science Services Administration's Automatic Picture Transmission based on the ESSA-6 weather satellite showed that the clouds from Naomi responsible for the rain had almost moved over the area near the dam. Based on the images, the authorities decided to gamble on the dam to successfully hold up, and it managed to <b>hold</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> waters without breaking. The hurricane caused four drowning deaths and $16 million in damage in Sinaloa.|$|E
