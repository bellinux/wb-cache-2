5|$|After Midway and the {{exhausting}} attrition of the Solomon Islands campaign, Japan's capacity to replace its losses in materiel (particularly aircraft carriers) and men (especially well-trained pilots and maintenance crewmen) rapidly became insufficient {{to cope with}} mounting casualties, while the United States' massive industrial and training capabilities made losses <b>far</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> replace. The Battle of Midway, along with the Guadalcanal Campaign, is widely considered {{a turning point in}} the Pacific War.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{which follows}} the {{procedure}} of relatively fast ascent interrupted by periods at constant depth {{is known as}} staged decompression. The ascent rate and the depth and duration of the stops are integral parts of the decompression process. The advantage of staged decompression {{is that it is}} <b>far</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> monitor and control than continuous decompression.|$|E
5|$|In April 1989, Voight {{returned}} to Colombia to the volcano Galeras after being {{contacted by the}} United Nations Disaster Relief Organization. People in Pasto, located {{at the foot of}} the volcano, had become alarmed by noises and shaking from Galeras. While Galeras proved <b>far</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> climb than Nevado del Ruiz, land mines planted to hinder guerrilla forces dotted the slopes of the mountain. With USGS geologist Dick Janda, Voight drew a hazard map that included several populated areas within the danger zone. Before Voight left Galeras, the volcano underwent an unexpected phreatic eruption, which Voight and his team failed to predict. Although Pasto was unaffected, six scientists attending a United Nations workshop for natural disaster relief were killed. After reviewing deformation data from the day before the eruption, Voight discovered that no acceleration in the deformation process had occurred. He surmised that phreatic eruptions do not exhibit an acceleration in deformation before taking place and left after confirming that the volcano's monitoring system functioned properly.|$|E

5|$|Raphel was {{instrumental}} in coordinating the State Department's establishment of diplomatic relations with the Taliban shortly after its takeover of Kabul. A senior Unocal executive commented that the pipeline project would be <b>far</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> implement with the Taliban in control, {{in reference to the}} need for central control in Afghanistan to undertake a project of the size, complexity and cost the Texas-based oil giant was considering. Unocal's consortium also included Saudi Arabia's Delta Oil, Pakistan's Crescent Group and Gazprom of Russia. The project involved building an 890-kilometer gas pipeline that would carry 1.9 billion cubic feet of gas to Pakistan each day. Unocal held detailed discussions with Taliban representatives in Houston in December 1997, striking a deal that would later collapse under the weight of rising U.S. and Afghan domestic political pressures against the Taliban's record on human rights, education and treatment of women.|$|E
25|$|The {{benefits}} of the A-kit/B-kit principle are that armor is only fitted when required, this reducing vehicle wear and tear, and by default whole life cycle costs. Improvements and/or upgrades to armor are also <b>far</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> integrate into an appliqué solution. The A-kit/B-kit principle is currently applied to all current production US tactical 'softskin' vehicles.|$|E
25|$|Besides being <b>far</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> handle, the wax {{recording}} media also allowed for lengthier recordings and created superior playback quality. The Graphophone designs initially deployed foot treadles to rotate the recordings {{which were then}} replaced by more convenient wind-up clockwork drive mechanisms and which finally migrated to electric motors, instead of the manual crank that was used on Edison's phonograph. The numerous improvements allowed for a sound quality that was significantly better than Edison's machine.|$|E

25|$|The {{decline of}} the {{steamship}} began after the World War Two. Many had {{been lost in the}} war, and marine diesel engine had finally matured as an economical and viable alternative to steam power. The diesel engine has far better thermal efficiency than reciprocating steam engine, and was <b>far</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> control. Diesel engine also requires far less supervision and maintenance than steam engine, and as an internal combustion engine it does not need boilers nor water supply, being therefore more space efficient.|$|E

25|$|In the Solar System, {{the inner}} planets are terrestrial, {{and the outer}} ones are gas giants, but discoveries of extrasolar planets suggest that this {{arrangement}} may not be at all common: numerous Jupiter-sized bodies {{have been found in}} close orbit about their primary, disrupting potential HZs. However, present data for extrasolar planets is likely to be skewed towards that type (large planets in close orbits) because they are <b>far</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> identify; thus {{it remains to be seen}} which type of planetary system is the norm, or indeed if there is one.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} type of {{testicular}} cancer occurring in undescended testes is seminoma. It is usually treatable if caught early, so urologists often recommend that boys who had orchiopexy as infants be taught testicular self-examination, to recognize testicular masses and seek early medical care for them. Cancer developing in an intra-abdominal testis would be unlikely to be recognized before considerable growth and spread, and {{one of the advantages of}} orchiopexy is that a mass developing in a scrotal testis is <b>far</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> recognize than an intra-abdominal mass.|$|E

She continually exerted pressure on him to find a partner with capital and to join the boom in Russian railway construction.|$|E
25|$|An {{electrostatic}} motor {{is based}} on the attraction and repulsion of electric charge. Usually, electrostatic motors are the dual of conventional coil-based motors. They typically require a high-voltage power supply, although very small motors employ lower voltages. Conventional electric motors instead employ magnetic attraction and repulsion, and require high current at low voltages. In the 1750s, the first electrostatic motors were developed by Benjamin Franklin and Andrew Gordon. Today, the electrostatic motor finds frequent use in micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) where their drive voltages are below 100 volts, and where moving, charged plates are <b>far</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> fabricate than coils and iron cores. Also, the molecular machinery that runs living cells is often based on linear and rotary electrostatic motors.|$|E
25|$|Wrestling's {{competitiveness}} was degraded by television, a fact {{regarded by}} many in the business as a natural effect of television over competition. The New York wrestling office soon became dominant, as it refused to use competitive wrestlers, and instead focused on attracting televised entertainment. Perhaps the first of the more comic book-like characters known to professional wrestling today was Antonino Rocca. Comparatively weak in wrestling ability, his marketable personality and barefoot acrobatics attracted fans and made him a national superstar, especially popular among Italian and Hispanic fans. The New York Wrestling office used him to revive the promotion on television, and found him <b>far</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> exploit than a more athletically skilled wrestler, enabling the office to negotiate wrestler contracts tremendously in its favor.|$|E

25|$|Brigadiers {{should move}} with the advance and divisional commanders should create {{reserves}} by reorganizing their brigades. Headquarters should be placed where attacks could be seen, {{to keep in touch}} with events when communications broke down, a chronic problem which was increased by distance from the front line. Telephone links in the rear were <b>far</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> maintain but became less important once the infantry battle began. Corps headquarters also had the benefit of air observation and less need of direct communication with troops on the battlefield, since their main role was counter-battery artillery-fire, which was independent of the infantry battle. The attack was to be maintained by the use of reserves moving towards objectives laid down before the attack, so as to make them independent of messages from the front line, which were often delayed and out of date if they arrived.|$|E
25|$|The Pit Bull Terrier {{was created}} by {{breeding}} Old English Terriers and Old English Bulldogs together to produce a dog that combined the gameness of the terrier with the strength and athleticism of the bulldog. These dogs (Bull and Terriers) were bred in England, and arrived in the United States where they became the direct ancestors of the American Pit Bull Terrier. In the United Kingdom, Bull-and-terriers were used in bloodsports such as bull baiting, bear baiting. These bloodsports were officially eliminated in 1835 as Britain began to introduce animal welfare laws. Since dogfights were cheaper to organise and <b>far</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> conceal from the law than bull or bear baits, bloodsport proponents turned to pitting their dogs against each other instead. Dog fighting was used as both a bloodsport (often involving gambling) {{and a way to}} continue to test the quality of their stock. For decades afterwards, dog fighting clandestinely took place in small areas of Britain and America. In the early 20th century, pit bulls were used as catch dogs in America for semi-wild cattle and hogs, to hunt, and drive livestock, and as family companions. Some have been selectively bred for their fighting prowess.|$|E
25|$|On 5 October, Gough {{had issued}} a Memorandum on Attacks which {{summarized}} {{the lessons of}} the battle. Gough pointed out that maintaining the momentum of an attack required that succeeding waves and reserves should not be kept waiting for opportunities to intervene in the battle, because communication delays left them with no time to act. Brigadiers should reorganize the troops holding successive objectives, since these troops became reserves once the advance had moved on. Brigadiers should move with the advance and divisional commanders should create reserves by reorganizing their brigades.
