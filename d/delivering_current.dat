The self-discharge rate did not increase monotonically with state-of-charge, but dropped somewhat at intermediate states of charge. Self-discharge rates may increase as batteries age.|$|E

Despite the fact that delivery of an electrical current to the hyperexcitable epileptic brain might, at first, seem contradictory, neurostimulation has become an established therapeutic option with a promising efficacy and adverse effects profile. In responsive neurostimulation the strategy is to interfere as early as possible with the accumulation of seizure activity to prematurely abort or even prevent an upcoming seizure. The design of technology required for responsive stimulation is more challenging compared with devices for open-loop neurostimulation. The achievement of therapeutic success is dependent on adequate sensing and stimulation algorithms and a fast coupling between both.

40|$|Abstract. Transcranial {{direct current}} {{stimulation}} (tDCS) provides a noninvasive tool to elicit neuromodulation by <b>delivering</b> <b>current</b> through electrodes {{placed on the}} scalp. The present clinical paradigm uses two relatively large electrodes to inject current through the head resulting in electric fields that are broadly distributed over large regions of the brain. In this paper, we present a method that uses multiple small electrodes (i. e., 1. 2 cm diameter) and systematically optimize the applied currents to achieve effective and targeted stimulation while ensuring safety of stimulation. We found a fundamental trade-off between achievable intensity (at the target) and focality, and algorithms to optimize both measures are presented. When compared with large pad-electrodes (approximated here {{by a set of}} small electrodes covering 25 cm 2) the proposed approach achieves electric fields which exhibit simultaneously greater focality (80 % improvement) and higher target intensity (98 % improvement) at cortical targets using the same total current applied.

40|$|Data stream {{applications}} like {{sensor network}} data, click stream data, have data arriving continuously {{at high speed}} rates and require online mining process capable of <b>delivering</b> <b>current</b> and near accurate results on demand without full access to all historical stored data. Frequent sequential mining {{is the process of}} discovering frequent sequential patterns in data sequences as found in applications like Web log access sequences. Mining frequent sequential patterns on data stream applications contend with many challenges such as limited memory for unlimited data, inability of algorithms to scan infinitely flowing original dataset more than once and to deliver current and accurate result on demand. Existing work on mining frequent patterns on data streams are mostly for non-sequential patterns.

It summarizes frequency counts of items with the D-list, continuously builds PLWAP tree and mines frequent sequential patterns of batches of stream records, maintains mined frequent sequential patterns incrementally with FSP tree.

DBS is a recognized method applied in movement disorders and is increasingly evaluated {{as a possible}} therapeutic option for psychiatric diseases such as refractory obsessive-compulsive disorders, Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, major depression and substance-related addiction. Latest research indicates that DBS may be a method for improving cognitive functions in Alzheimer’s dementia (AD). Translational data in healthy and AD animals appear to support this notion. Nevertheless, many aspects remain unclear, {{particularly with regard to}} the optimal target structure. The objective of this review is to present a systematic overview regarding published research on DBS and cognitive functioning in animal and human studies as well as to provide a systematic overview of the feasibility and efficacy of the treatment. We describe three studies investigating the effects of DBS in patients with dementia, using either the fornix or the nucleus basalis of Meynert as a target. In total, we identified 25 animal studies with 10 brain structures being targeted: fornix, nucleus basalis of Meynert, anterior caudate nucleus, dorsal striatum, anterior thalamic nucleus, midline thalamic nuclei, central thalamic nuclei, lateral hypothalamus, hippocampus (entorhinal cortex, perforant path) and amygdala.

40|$|The {{depletion}} {{of fossil fuels}} and the climate change have spurred tremendous research interest {{in the development of}} electrochemical technologies such as water splitting for conversion and storage of electricity produced from renewable sources such as solar and wind. However, the sluggish kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water splitting remains a major challenge for widespread application of the technology. Catalysts {{play a key role in}} reducing the OER energy barrier, and improving the overall efficiency. Currently, the most efficient OER catalysts are noble-metal based materials including RuO 2 and IrO 2. However, these noble metals are expensive and the supply is unsustainable, and is not suitable for large-scale application. Therefore, the development of highly efficient and cost-effective electrocatalysts is highly demanded for substitution of these noble metal-based catalysts. In this thesis, two novel non-precious metal-based mesoporous multi-metallic catalysts are developed for enhanced OER. Specifically, i) Fe embedded mesoporous Co 3 O 4 (Fe/mCo 3 O 4) is prepared via hard-template direct nanocasting method for OER. Attributed to an unusual synergistic effect between mCo 3 O 4 and Fe, Fe/mCo 3 O 4 is capable of <b>delivering</b> <b>current</b> density of 30 mA cm- 2 at the overpotential of 440 mV showing higher catalytic activity than conventional Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles. ii) A freestanding, hierarchically structured 3 D electrode comprising of topmost mesoporous NiFe nanosheets, in-between nanoporous NiCo 2 O 4 nanoflakes and bottom macroporous Ni foam (NiFe/NiCo 2 O 4 /NF) is achieved for highly efficient OER at high current densities. The electrode can deliver a current density of 1200 mA cm- 2 at 1. 57 V vs. RHE, which is comparable to the benchmark IrO 2 and RuO 2 catalysts. The physical properties of the catalysts are characterised by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms. The electrochemical performances are evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and chronoamperometry. The results obtained in this thesis highlight that by proper design of nanoporous structures of the catalysts and smart utilisation of metal-metal synergistic interactions, multi-transition metal-based catalysts offer promising substitutes for the noble metal-based catalysts for use in commercial water splitting systems...|$|E

The transmission line consists of a cable header, load protection switch, and tri-plate assembly interfacing to the center transition section. The cable header interface to the Marx module provides a mechanism to remove the Marx module for maintenance without removing other components of the transmission line.

The aluminum tri-plate is a low-inductance transmission line carries radial current flow from the Marx energy storage system at the machine periphery toward the load.
