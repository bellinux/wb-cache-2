5|$|On September 11, 2001, United Airlines Flight 93 was hijacked by {{four members}} of al-Qaeda {{as part of the}} September 11 attacks. The hijackers' {{specific}} target was the United States Capitol. Among the pilots available that day of the 113th Wing of the DC Air National Guard were Lieutenant Colonel Marc H. Sasseville and Lieutenant Heather Penney Garcia. They were given the mission of finding the United Airlines Flight 93 and destroying it however they could. Since the fighter jets were absent of missiles and packed only with <b>dummy</b> <b>ammunition</b> from a recent training mission, {{there was only one way}} to do it and that was by ramming the aircraft. The fighter jets passed over the ravaged Pentagon building, however it was not until hours later that they would find out that United 93 had already gone down in a field outside Shanksville, Pennsylvania, killing all 44 people aboard including the 4 hijackers.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This study {{investigated}} leukocyte subset responses to moderate-intensity exercise under heat stress, with water (W) or carbohydrate (CHO) drink ingestion. Methods: In repeated trials, 13 soldiers consumed either a W or CHO drink during 3 h of walking at 4. 4 km center dot h(- 1) with a 5 % gradient (15 min rest per hour) under heat stress (35 C and 55 % relative humidity). The soldiers wore combat uniforms and carried water bottles and <b>dummy</b> rifles and <b>ammunition,</b> altogether weighing about 11. 5 +/- 1. 0 kg. Results: Plasma glucose concentration {{was significantly higher}} with CHO than W ingestion during exercise (p < 0. 01). There {{were no significant differences}} between W and CHO conditions in exercise performance, plasma cortisol concentration, heart rate, or core temperature. CHO ingestion significantly moderated the increases in leukocyte (83 % in W, 28 % in CHO; p < 0. 001), monocyte (60 % in W, 34 % in CHO; p < 0. 05), and granulocyte counts (120 % in W, 30 % in CHO; p < 0. 001), but not in lymphocyte count (41 % in W, 25 % in CHO). Conclusions: The increases in leukocyte and subset counts during moderate-intensity exercise under heat stress may be comparable to those observed during intense exercise in cool conditions. The response of immune cell counts is blunted by CHO intake during moderate-intensity exercise in the heat, and may not occur through the cortisol pathway...|$|R

Russian media have widely reported that and, as result, RT and TASS agencies who worked with Saponkov previously both publicly condemned his comments.|$|E
5000|$|A dummy round or drill round is a round that is {{completely}} inert, i.e., contains no primer, propellant, or explosive charge. It is used to check weapon function, and for crew training. [...] <b>Dummy</b> <b>ammunition</b> is distinct from [...] "practice" [...] ammunition, which may contain smaller than normal amounts of propellant and/or explosive. [...] For example, the M69 practice hand grenade emits a loud pop and a puff of white smoke.|$|E
