5|$|As the {{campaign}} unfolded, Krueger was pressured by MacArthur to capture Manila. He sent messages reporting {{what he saw}} {{was a lack of}} drive among the troops, and even moved his theater headquarters forward of Krueger's. MacArthur tried to exploit Krueger's rivalry with Eichelberger by allowing the latter's Eighth Army to conduct its own drive on Manila from the south. Krueger eventually sent a flying column from the 1st Cavalry Division, but MacArthur's <b>expectation</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Japanese would not defend Manila was proven incorrect. Weeks of ferocious fighting were required to capture the city.|$|E
5|$|HP {{believed}} that it was no longer cost-effective for individual enterprise systems companies such as itself to develop proprietary microprocessors, so it partnered with Intel in 1994 to develop the IA-64 architecture, derived from EPIC. Intel was willing to undertake a very large development effort on IA-64 in the <b>expectation</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> resulting microprocessor would be used by the majority of enterprise systems manufacturers. HP and Intel initiated a large joint development effort with a goal of delivering the first product, Merced, in 1998.|$|E

5|$|In 1960 the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Derick Heathcoat-Amory, {{insisted on}} retiring. Macmillan agreed with Heathcoat-Amory {{that the best}} {{successor}} at the Treasury would be the current Foreign Secretary, Selwyn Lloyd. In terms of ability and experience the obvious candidate to take over from Lloyd at the Foreign Office was Home, but by 1960 there was an <b>expectation</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Foreign Secretary would {{be a member of}} the House of Commons. The post had not been held by a peer since Lord Halifax in 1938–40; Eden had wished to appoint Salisbury in 1955, but concluded that it would be unacceptable to the Commons.|$|E
5|$|A new {{contract}} was signed on 19 July 2011 with Odebrecht; R$400million {{of the total}} would be financed by BNDES and the remaining R$420million would come from tax credits granted by the City. A 2007 law stated the tax credits {{could be used by}} any company that established itself in the Eastern region of the city, providing a credit of R$0.60 per R$1.00 invested. A new law was passed by the city legislature to deal specifically with this stadium and reduce the incentives, linking the concession of the credits to hosting the World Cup opening match and limiting the total amount of credits to R$420million. The concession was justified by the <b>expectation</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> stadium will generate R$950 million in city taxes during the six years after its opening. R$530 million in excess of the tax credits were given. The financing contract with BNDES was signed on 29 November 2013, under their ProCopas Arenas World Cup program. Caixa Econômica Federal is the distributing agent.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{of three}} Kolkata-class ships was {{sanctioned by the}} Government of India in May 2000, and steel for the lead ship was cut in March 2003. Construction began in September 2003 at Mazagon Docks, Mumbai, with an initial <b>expectation</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first of the class would be {{handed over to the}} navy by 2010. However, since then the Kolkata class has {{suffered}} consecutive delays, slow construction procedures and technical problems which saw the first ship of the class enter service during mid 2014. The delays in the construction programme have been attributed to persistent design changes made by the Indian Navy to incorporate new weapons systems and sensors, failure by a Ukrainian shipyard to deliver the ship's propellers and shafts and the contract later being awarded to a Russian firm, and finally the delay in the delivery of the Barak 8 anti-air missiles, which are still {{in the final stages of}} completion with Israel Aerospace Industries and the Defence Research and Development Organisation.|$|E

5|$|The first {{bridge on}} the site was a toll bridge built by Julian Tolmé in 1873, in the <b>expectation</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> western {{terminus}} of the Hammersmith and City Railway would shortly be built on the north bank, leading to {{a sharp increase in}} the number of people wanting to cross the river at this point. The railway terminus was not built, and problems with drainage on the approach road made access to the bridge difficult for vehicles. Wandsworth Bridge was commercially unsuccessful, and in 1880 it was taken into public ownership and made toll-free. Tolmé's bridge was narrow and too weak to carry buses, and in 1926 a Royal Commission recommended its replacement.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year 1506, Pope Julius {{conceived}} a program to paint {{the ceiling of the}} Sistine Chapel. The walls of the chapel had been decorated twenty years earlier. The lowest of three levels is painted to resemble draped hangings and was (and sometimes still is) hung on special occasions with the set of tapestries designed by Raphael. The middle level contains a complex scheme of frescoes illustrating the Life of Christ on the right side and the Life of Moses on the left side. It was carried out by some of the most renowned Renaissance painters: Botticelli, Ghirlandaio, Perugino, Pinturicchio, Signorelli and Cosimo Rosselli. The upper level of the walls contains the windows, between which are painted pairs of illusionistic niches with representations of the first thirty-two popes. A draft by Matteo d'Amelia indicates that the ceiling was painted blue like that of the Arena Chapel and decorated with gold stars, possibly representing the zodiacal constellations. It is probable that, because the chapel was the site of regular meetings and Masses of an elite body of officials known as the Papal Chapel who would observe the decorations and interpret their theological and temporal significance, it was Pope Julius' intention and <b>expectation</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> iconography of the ceiling was to be read with many layers of meaning.|$|E
5|$|In the semi-finals Cardiff {{were drawn}} against Reading; the match was played at Molineux Stadium. Reading {{had reached the}} semi-final {{for the first time}} in their history. Additional trains were put on to bring Cardiff fans to Wolverhampton for the match, and there was an <b>expectation</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> game would set a new {{capacity}} record for the ground. Heavy rain had fallen before the match, resulting in a soft pitch. Reading appeared the stronger of the two teams at the start, but at 25 minutes Bert Eggo failed to clear the ball from the Reading penalty area and Ferguson pounced, scoring for Cardiff. This changed the match, which from then on was dominated by the Welsh. A further goal followed in the 35th minute from Harry Wake, sending Cardiff into half time two goals ahead. Reading pressed on initially during the second half, but Cardiff gradually regained domination of play, and Ferguson scored his second of the game in the 70th minute. Cardiff's fans began to celebrate early, believing that Reading could not come back from three goals down, which was the final result of the game.|$|E

5|$|In Borissik Svetlana v. Urban Redevelopment Authority (2009), the {{applicant}} {{and her husband}} owned a semi-detached house which they wished to redevelop. In 2002, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) had issued a circular imposing certain restrictions on the redevelopment of semi-detached houses. The URA rejected {{the applicant}}'s redevelopment application {{on the basis of}} the circular. Counsel for the applicant argued before the High Court that the applicant had a legitimate <b>expectation</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> proposal to redevelop the house would be approved. The Court held that the URA had not acted in a way that could have led the applicant to have such a legitimate expectation. It adopted four conditions set out in De Smith's Judicial Review (6th ed., 2007) to determine whether a legitimate expectation has been created: the public body's representation must be clear, unambiguous and devoid of any relevant qualification; induced by the conduct of the decision-maker; made by a person with actual or ostensible authority; and applicable to the applicant, who belongs to the class of persons to whom the representation is reasonably expected to apply. The only legitimate expectation that could have arisen after the 2002 circular had been issued was that the URA would act in accordance with those guidelines unless the circumstances were such that an exception has to be made. The applicant in Borissik argued that she had a legitimate expectation to a substantive right, but since the Court decided that the URA had made no clear representation to her, it did not make any pronouncements on the approach that should be taken towards substantive legitimate expectations in Singapore.|$|E
