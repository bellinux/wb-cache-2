Before the Regulation the Commission granted its approval for exempting certain types of agreements which fulfilled the conditions under the article 81 section 3 of the EC Treaty, i. e. if they contribute to improving the production or distribution of goods or to promoting technical or economic progress, while allowing consumers a fair share of the resulting benefit, and which does not impose on the undertakings concerned restrictions which are not indispensable to the attainment of these objectives and afford such undertakings the possibility of eliminating competition in respect of a substantive part of the products in question. A weak point of such a regulation was that the Commission was permanently overloaded by numerous demands for <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>inapplicability</b> of a cartel prohibition. Therefore there was strong need to modify the system {{in order to make the}} work of the Commission more effective [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|While a {{significant}} body of international and regional agreements now addresses habitat preservation, wildlife protection, and biological diversity, these advances {{on the international}} level often fail to be effectively translated into domestic law. In this article, the author argues that international biodiversity law is being treated in Canada as 2 ̆ 2 exotic 2 ̆ 2. It is peppered into parties 2 ̆ 7 submissions without a principled explanation of its role in Canadian law, receives little consideration from the courts, and must ultimately rely on non-legal means of enforcement. The author examines the jurisprudence dealing with four major biodiversity treaties. She notes that the judicial treatment of these conventions ranges from silence, to <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> <b>inapplicability,</b> to limited usage in statutory interpretation. This impoverished view of international biodiversity law in Canadian courtrooms is contrasted with the richer understanding of the relevance of this body of law demonstrated by its usage in environmental advocacy campaigns. The author focuses on two case studies: the 1992 - 2002 campaign for federal endangered species legislation, and the ongoing Cheviot mine campaign. In these campaigns, compliance with international biodiversity law is pursued through various shaming strategies. The author concludes that both the judiciary and environmental advocacy groups {{have a role to}} play in identifying where Canada fails to give domestic effect to the obligations it assumes under ratified biodiversity treaties, and in addressing this failure...|$|R

In that case upon the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> cessation of incapacity, a change of regent takes place, with {{the person who has}} a lower place in the order of succession ceasing to be the regent, and in his or her stead the person with a higher position in the order of succession, who had only ceased to be regent due to the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> incapacity, resuming the office of regent.
