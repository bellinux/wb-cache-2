The final desired orientation of the formation is by observing a minimum distance between {{every member of the}} swarm and ghost walls.

40|$|Hydraulic {{expansion}} of submerged tubes {{is accomplished by}} propelling a mandrel through it using differential pressure. This process deforms the tube beyond its elastic limit. Toward {{the end of the}} expansion process, the mandrel pops out of the tube resulting in displacement, stress, and pressure waves propagating through the system. A mathematical model has been developed to describe the dynamics of the tube-fluid system due to the pop-out phenomenon. The model takes into consideration the coupling effect between fluids and the structure, as well as the inherent system damping of its response. An analytical solution describing the wave propagation in the tube-fluid system was obtained. The model identified the potential failure locations and showed that the inherent system damping reduced the chances of failure but could not eliminate it completely. In addition, it showed that the coupling effect was more prominent in the tube as compared to the outer and inner fluids. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was conducted in order to investigate the effect of the geometrical and material properties on the response.

However, a major drawback of these TEHVs is compaction and retraction of the leaflets, causing regurgitation. To overcome this problem, {{the aim of this}} study was to investigate: (a) the use of the slowly degrading poly-e-caprolactone (PCL) scaffold for prolonged mechanical integrity; and (b) the use of lower passage cells for enhanced tissue formation. Passage 3, 5 and 7 (P 3, P 5 and P 7) human and ovine vascular-derived cells were seeded onto both PGA-P 4 HB and PCL scaffold strips. After 4 weeks of culture, compaction, tissue formation, mechanical properties and cell phenotypes were compared. TEHVs were cultured to observe retraction of the leaflets in the native-like geometry. After culture, tissues based on PGA-P 4 HB scaffold showed 50 - 60 % compaction, while PCL-based tissues showed compaction of 0 - 10 %. Tissue <b>formation,</b> <b>stiffness</b> and strength were increased with decreasing passage number; however, this did not influence compaction. Ovine PCL-based tissues did render less strong tissues compared to PGA-P 4 HB-based tissues. No differences in cell phenotype between the scaffold materials, species or cell passage numbers were observed. This study shows that PCL scaffolds may serve as alternative scaffold materials for human TEHVs with minimal compaction and without compromising tissue composition and properties, while further optimization of ovine TEHVs is needed. Reducing cell expansion time will result in faster generation of TEHVs, providing more rapid treatment for patients...|$|E
40|$|Background: Proximal {{hamstring}} repair {{for complete}} ruptures {{has become a}} common treatment. There is no consensus in the literature about postoperative rehabilitation protocols following proximal hamstring repair. Some protocols describe bracing to prevent hip flexion or knee extension while others describe no immobilization. There are currently no biomechanical studies evaluating proximal hamstring repairs; nor are there any studies evaluating the effect of different hip flexion angles on these repairs. Hypothesis: As hip flexion increases from 0 to 90, {{there will be a}} greater gap with cyclical loading. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Proximal hamstring insertions were detached from the ischial tuberosity in 24 cadavers and were repaired with 3 single-loaded suture anchors in the hamstring footprint with a Krakow suture technique. Cyclic loading from 10 to 125 N at 1 Hz was then performed for 0, 45, and 90 of hip flexion for 1500 cycles. Gap <b>formation,</b> <b>stiffness,</b> yield load, ultimate load, and energy to ultimate load were compared between groups using paired t tests. Results: Cyclic loading demonstrated the least amount of gap formation (P <. 05) at 0 of hip flexion (2. 39 mm) and most at 90 of hip flexion (4. 19 mm). There {{was no significant difference in}} ultimate load between hip flexion angles (326, 309, and 338 N at 0, 45, and 90, respectively). The most common mode of failure occurred with knot/suture failure (n 17). Conclusion: Increasing hip flexion from 0 to 90 increases the displacement across proximal hamstring repairs. Postoperative bracing that limits hip flexion should be considered. Clinical Relevance: Repetitive motion involving hip flexion after a proximal hamstring repair may cause compromise of the repair...|$|E

A test rig concept has been developed to accurately measure the interaction forces and torques between the bit, formation and fluids during drilling in order to clearly define a bit/formation interface law (BFIL) for the purpose vibrational analysis.

40|$|Tissue cells {{sense and}} respond to the {{stiffness}} of the surface on which they adhere. Precisely how cells sense surface stiffness remains an open question, though various biochemical pathways are critical for a proper stiffness response. Here, based on a simple mechanochemical model of biological friction, we propose a model for cell mechanosensation as opposed to previous more biochemically based models. Our model of adhesion complexes predicts that these cell-surface interactions provide a viscous drag that increases with the elastic modulus of the surface. The force-velocity relation of myosin II implies that myosin generates greater force when the adhesion complexes slide slowly. Then, using a simple cytoskeleton model, we show that an external force applied to the cytoskeleton causes actin filaments to aggregate and orient parallel to the direction of force application. The greater the external force, the faster this aggregation occurs. As the steady-state probability of forming these bundles reflects a balance between the time scale of bundle formation and destruction (because of actin turnover), more bundles are formed when the cytoskeleton time-scale is small (i. e., on stiff surfaces), in agreement with experiment. As these large bundles of actin, called stress fibers, appear preferentially on stiff surfaces, our mechanical model provides a mechanism for stress fiber <b>formation</b> and <b>stiffness</b> sensing in cells adhered to a compliant surface...|$|R

In vitro models present ethical and cost advantages over in vivo models, and allow for controlled, mechanistic studies on factors that regulate normal and abnormal tissue development. Alginate, a linear polysaccharide derived from brown algae, has properties that make it a favorable material as a 3 -D extracellular matrix for in vitro cell and tissue models. After demonstrating alginate’s tunable {{physical and chemical properties}} with respect to gel <b>formation,</b> <b>stiffness,</b> and cellular interactions, alginate hydrogel was employed in two separate culture systems that share in common the ultimate goal of serving as in vitro models of tissue development and function: 1) an in vitro model of pig embryo elongation to develop strategies for improving pregnancy outcomes, and 2) an in vitro model of growth plate cartilage to discover factors necessary for inducing native cartilage architecture for tissue engineering applications. In regards to pig embryo culture, embryos encapsulated within alginate hydrogels exhibited greater survival and morphological changes than non-encapsulated control embryos, along with increased expression of steroidogenic transcripts and estrogen production, consistent with in vivo elongation. For the growth plate model, alginate hydrogels were used for the encapsulation of mouse growth plate chondrocytes in vitro to study the effects of soluble parathyroid hormone (PTH), a signaling factor that regulates growth plate structure and function in vivo, along with the effects of an arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) peptide conjugated to the alginate. PTH and RGD peptide treatment resulted in decreased collagen X and Indian hedgehog transcript expression in encapsulated chondrocytes, demonstrating the role of these factors on the regulation of chondrocyte hypertrophy in vitro. Overall, information gained from utilizing these in vitro models as research tools can be used to advance the field of developmental biology and enhance tissue engineering therapies for the treatment of degenerative diseases.

40|$|Gas {{hydrates}} are clathrate hydrates, {{which are}} solid, ice-like compounds. Gas hydrates exist {{where there is}} an ample supply of gas and water combined with high pressure and/or low temperature conditions. In nature these are found in sediments where permafrost is present, and in deep-marine sediments. The morphology of gas hydrate within a sediment has a large impact on the strength and stiffness properties of hydrate bearing sediments. Gas hydrates are metastable and they dissociate if the temperature and/or pressure conditions are sufficiently altered. The dissociation of gas hydrate and its potential as a submarine geohazard have become of increasing importance as {{oil and gas exploration}} activities extend into significant water depths on continental margins and seas where gas hydrates are known to exist. Such activities may lead to dissociation of hydrate, possibly increasing pore pressure, and altering the stiffness and strength of the sediment. Due to difficulty in performing field testing and obtaining undisturbed in-situ samples for testing, at present, hydrate dissociation in the natural environment and its effects are hypothesised on the basis of remote observations. Therefore, a series of well-controlled laboratory tests were conducted on laboratory-prepared methane hydrate bearing sand sediments. The tests were undertaken with hydrate saturation ranging from 7 % to 27 % in the Gas Hydrate Resonant Column Apparatus (GHRC). Factors such as effective stress were also assessed with regard to specimen stiffness. Resonant column testing during hydrate formation and dissociation processes carried out for the first time, such that not only final change in specimen properties to be determined as a function of total hydrate saturation but also the change in specimen properties as function of the percentage of hydrate formation and dissociation. Test results showed that a rapid reduction in stiffness occurred for a minor change in hydrate saturation of sand specimens where dissociation was induced by temperature increase, but for specimens that were dissociated using the pressure reduction method a slower reduction occurred. In contrast, during hydrate <b>formation</b> <b>stiffness</b> increased more gradually. In addition, test results showed that the hydrate formation using the excess gas method led to higher increases in the shear stiffness compared to the flexural stiffness of specimens, and the linear stiffness threshold limit of hydrate bearing specimens were lower than the non-hydrate bearing sands. In addition to laboratory tests, an analytical model was built to predict the increase in pore pressure under undrained conditions within hydrate bearing sediment during dissociation. The results obtained from the laboratory tests were used to compare the predicted results from the model. Analytical model showed that the rise in pore pressure within a sediment was dependent on a number of factors: major factors were initial pore pressure, amount of hydrate dissociation, cage occupancy of gas within hydrate, stiffness of the sediment, and degree of water saturation; Minor factors were methane gas solubility in water, and methane hydrate density.

In order to perform accurate force measurements we analyzed dynamics of an optically trapped microsphere under altering external viscous drag force using Fourier methods. Next, using optically trapped fluorescent microspheres, we recorded tethering force vs. PM displacement profiles, which revealed the tether formation process, initiated with linear deformation of the PM, followed by a nonlinear regime and terminated with the local separation of PM. Tethering force vs. displacement profiles were used to estimate tether <b>formation</b> force and <b>stiffness</b> parameter of the PM. Integration of the force-displacement profiles yielded the work of tether formation, including linear and nonlinear components. We characterized mechanical properties of the outer hair (OHC) and human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell PMs perfused with 10 mM sodium salicylate (Sal), which is known to affect electromotility of OHCs as well as PM surface charge, morphology of erythrocytes, and PM lipid diffusion. Sal reduced tether <b>formation</b> force, PM <b>stiffness</b> parameter, and equilibrium tethering force in HEK cells, explained by enhanced PM/cytoskeleton compliance. The parameters estimated for OHCs remained the same after Sal perfusion, {{which is consistent with}} the hypothesis that Sal induced reversible hearing loss appears to be more the result of its competition with essential anions and less the result of a change in PM mechanics. Finally, we found that cell perfusion with hypo- and hyperosmotic solutions did not influence equilibrium tethering force, attributed to cellular regulation of the effective PM tension. The observed reduction in magnitude of the fast tethering force relaxation process was related to the stress-minimizing redistribution of the PM lipids. Application of a non-specific transmembrane water transport blocker, mercury (II) chloride, increased steady-state and equilibrium tethering forces and suppressed slow component of the tethering force relaxation. Temporal tethering force profiles obtained from the same PM tethers pulled in several repetitive cycles exhibited different behavior and resulted in reduced forces and time constants explained by essential irreversibility of PM tether elongation involving PM-cytoskeleton dissociation and/or plastic deformations...|$|R

A promising approach is based on three-dimensional collagen type I matrices that are stiffened by cross-linking through non-enzymatic glycation with reducing sugars. Methods: The present study evaluated the biomechanical changes in the non-enzymatically glycated type I collagen matrices, including collagen organization, the advanced glycation end products <b>formation</b> and <b>stiffness</b> achievement. Gels were glycated with ribose at different concentrations (0, 5, 15, 30 and 240 mM). The viability and the phenotypic changes of primary human lung fibroblasts cultured within the non-enzymatically glycated gels were also evaluated along three consecutive weeks. Statistical tests used for data analyze were Mann Whitney U, Kruskal Wallis, Student's t-test, two-way ANOVA, multivariate ANOVA, linear regression test and mixed linear model. Results: Our findings indicated that the process of collagen glycation increases the stiffness of the matrices and generates advanced glycation end products in a ribose concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, we identified optimal ribose concentrations and media conditions for cell viability and growth within the glycated matrices. The microenvironment of this collagen based three-dimensional culture induces α-smooth muscle actin and tenascin-C fibroblast protein expression. Finally, a progressive contractile phenotype cell differentiation was associated with the contraction of these gels. Conclusions: The use of non-enzymatic glycation with a low ribose concentration may provide a suitable model with a mechanic and oxidative modified environment with cell s embedded in it, which allowed cell proliferation and induced fibroblast phenotypic changes. Such culture model could be appropriate for investigations of the behavior and phenotypic changes in cells that occur during lung fibrosis as well as for testing different antifibrotic therapies in vitro...|$|R

This thesis presents results from a correlation study between formation mechanical properties and acoustic wave velocities from a set of unpublished rock mechanical experiments on sandstone samples from the Norwegian shelf. The core samples from the Norwegian shelf were subjected to triaxial compression tests performed at various confining pressures with simultaneous measurements of acoustic velocities. Correlations between formation compressive strength, elastic stiffness and Poisson's ratio and compressional and shear transit time have been established. The results obtained in this study confirm that the stress level and the stress configuration affect the acoustic velocities, and this should be accounted for when using generalized empirical correlations to estimate <b>formation</b> strength, elastic <b>stiffness</b> and Poisson's ratio from acoustic logs in field studies.

This produced selective alterations in regulation of genes involved in hyphal body <b>formation,</b> cell membrane <b>stiffness,</b> and generation of intracellular turgor pressure, suggesting that these processes are mediated by MOS 1. Consistent with a role in stress responses, transcript depletion of Mos 1 increased sensitivity to osmotic and oxidative stresses and to compounds that interfere with cell wall biosynthesis. It also disrupted developmental processes, including formation of appressoria and hyphal bodies. Insect bioassays confirmed that Mos 1 knockdown significantly reduces virulence. Overall, our data show that M. anisopliae MOS 1 mediates cellular responses to high osmotic pressure and subsequent adaptations to colonize host hemolymph...|$|R
40|$|The {{abdominal}} aorta (AA) in {{man is a}} vulnerable artery prone to atherosclerosis as well as aneurysmatic dilation. The underlying aortic composition, mechanical properties {{as well as the}} mechanisms responsible for age-related changes and vascular disease are however largely unknown. The aims of this study were 1) to characterize the age- and gender-related changes of the aortic wall components in vivo, using a mechanical model based on ultrasound measurements of pulsatile aortic diameter changes combined with intra-arterial pressure; 2) to validate ultrasound measurements of diameter and intima-media thickness (IMT) of the AA in order to calculate wall stress; 3) to study the stress driven remodeling response of the aortic wall in healthy individuals and the influence of age and gender; and 4) to study wall stress and remodeling of the AA in diabetic patients in order to elucidate the protective influence of diabetes on abdominal aortic aneurysm <b>formation.</b> The <b>stiffness</b> of the isotropic material (mainly elastin) increased in males despite the known decrease in elastin content with age. Further, an exponential increase in stiffness of the anisotropic material (mainly collagen) in males at high physiological pressure was found. This might be due to changed isoforms of collagen and increased glycation with age. Females were less affected than males. The reproducibility of the ultrasound measurements of diameter and IMT in the AA was acceptable (CV; 4 % and 11 % respectively), making it possible to calculate circumferential aortic wall stress in vivo. The age-related remodeling of the arterial wall led to increased diameter, and compensatory thickening of the wall preventing the circumferential wall stress from increasing in the common carotid artery of males and females, and the AA of females. However, the compensatory increase in wall thickness was defect in the male AA, where stress increased with age. Pulsatile stress influenced the material parameters of the AA, leading to increased stiffness of anisotropic material (mainly collagen), whereas stiffness of isotropic material (mainly elastin) was unaffected. Patients with diabetes mellitus had increased aortic wall thickness than controls, generating less circumferential stress. This coincides with the known reduction of abdominal aortic aneurysms in diabetic patients and may act as a protective factor...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Cystinosis is {{characterized}} by intralysosomal cystine accumulation, causing end stage renal disease around 10  years of age if not treated with cysteamine. Cystine accumulation in blood vessels might increase atheroma <b>formation</b> or arterial <b>stiffness</b> and therefore increase the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). This study aimed to investigate the risk for CVD by non-invasive measures of atherosclerosis (NIMA) and to evaluate the effect of cysteamine treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirteen Dutch adult cystinosis patients were included. White blood cell (WBC) cystine levels, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and concommitant medications were obtained from medical records. NIMA included carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT, n[*]=[*] 13), pulse wave velocity (PWV, n[*]=[*] 8) and pulse wave analysis (PWA, n[*]=[*] 6). RESULTS: GFR ranged between 4 - 95  mL/min/ 1. 73  m². All but one patient were treated with cysteamine, mean WBC cystine values ranged between 0. 34 - 1. 64  nmol cystine/mg protein, 8 patients had mean WBC cystine levels < 1  nmol cystine/mg protein. When compared to healthy subjects, cIMT and PWV levels were above normal values in 1 patient for each measure. PWA measurements showed high augmentation index in three patients who did not receive lipid-lowering medication. When corrected for renal function, cIMT and PWV levels were within the normal range. CONCLUSION: Young adult cystinosis patients treated with cysteamine have no additional risk for CVD when {{compared to patients with}} chronic kidney disease of other causes. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Decellularized tissues {{have proven}} to be {{versatile}} matrices for the engineering of tissues and organs. These matrices usually consist of collagens, matrix-specific proteins, and a set of largely undefined growth factors and signaling molecules. Although several decellularized tissues have found their way to clinical applications, their use in the engineering of cartilage tissue has only been explored to a limited extent. We set out to generate hydrogels from several tissue-derived matrices, as hydrogels are the current preferred cell carriers for cartilage repair. Equine cartilage, meniscus, and tendon tissue was harvested, decellularized, enzymatically digested, and functionalized with methacrylamide groups. After photo-cross-linking, these tissue digests were mechanically characterized. Next, gelatin methacrylamide (GelMA) hydrogel was functionalized with these methacrylated tissue digests. Equine chondrocytes and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) (both from three donors) were encapsulated and cultured in vitro up to 6 weeks. Gene expression (COL 1 A 1, COL 2 A 1, ACAN, MMP- 3, MMP- 13, and MMP- 14), cartilage-specific matrix <b>formation,</b> and hydrogel <b>stiffness</b> were analyzed after culture. The cartilage, meniscus, and tendon digests were successfully photo-cross-linked into hydrogels. The addition of the tissue-derived matrices to GelMA affected chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs, although no consequent improvement was demonstrated. For chondrocytes, the tissue-derived matrix gels performed worse compared to GelMA alone. This work demonstrates {{for the first time that}} native tissues can be processed into crosslinkable hydrogels for the engineering of tissues. Moreover, the differentiation of encapsulated cells can be influenced in these stable, decellularized matrix hydrogels...|$|R
40|$|Liddle syndrome, an {{inherited}} form of hypertension, {{is caused by}} gain-of-function mutations in the epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC), the principal mediator of Na(+) reabsorption in the kidney. Accordingly, the disease pathology was ascribed to a primary renal mechanism. Whether this is the sole responsible mechanism, however, remains uncertain as dysregulation of ENaC in other tissues may also be involved. Previous work indicates that ENaC in the vascular endothelium is crucial for the regulation of cellular mechanics and thus vascular function. The hormone aldosterone {{has been shown to}} concomitantly increase ENaC surface expression and stiffness of the cell cortex in vascular endothelial cells. The latter entails a reduced release of the vasodilator nitric oxide, which eventually leads to an increase in vascular tone and blood pressure. Using atomic force microscopy, we have found a direct correlation between ENaC surface expression and the <b>formation</b> of cortical <b>stiffness</b> in endothelial cells. Stable knockdown of alphaENaC in endothelial cells evoked a reduced channel surface density and a lower cortical stiffness compared with the mock control. In turn, an increased alphaENaC expression induced an elevated cortical stiffness. More importantly, using ex vivo preparations from a mouse model for Liddle syndrome, we show that this disorder evokes enhanced ENaC expression and increased cortical stiffness in vascular endothelial cells in situ. We conclude that ENaC in the vascular endothelium determines cellular mechanics and hence might participate in the control of vascular function...|$|R
40|$|The seismic {{performance}} of recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) composite shear walls with different expandable polystyrene (EPS) configurations was investigated. Six concrete shear walls were designed and tested under cyclic loading {{to evaluate the}} effect of fine RAC in designing earthquake-resistant structures. Three of the six specimens were used to construct mid-rise walls with a shear-span ratio of 1. 5, {{and the other three}} specimens were used to construct low-rise walls with a shear-span ratio of 0. 8. The mid-rise and low-rise shear walls consisted of an ordinary recycled concrete shear wall, a composite wall with fine aggregate concrete (FAC) protective layer (EPS modules as the external insulation layer), and a composite wall with sandwiched EPS modules as the insulation layer. Several parameters obtained from the experimental results were compared and analyzed, including the load-bearing capacity, stiffness, ductility, energy dissipation, and failure characteristics of the specimens. The calculation formula of load-bearing capacity was obtained by considering the effect of FAC on composite shear walls as the protective layer. The damage process of the specimen was simulated using the ABAQUS Software, and the results agreed quite well with those obtained from the experiments. The results show that the seismic resistance behavior of the EPS module composite for shear walls performed better than ordinary recycled concrete for shear walls. Shear walls with sandwiched EPS modules had a better seismic performance than those with EPS modules lying outside. Although the FAC protective layer slightly improved the seismic {{performance of}} the structure, it undoubtedly slowed down the speed of crack <b>formation</b> and the <b>stiffness</b> degradation of the walls...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundDamage to {{articular}} cartilage {{is one of}} the features of osteoarthritis (OA). Cartilage damage is characterised by a net loss of collagen and proteoglycans. The collagen network is considered highly important for cartilage function but little is known about processes that control composition and function of the cartilage collagen network in cartilage tissue engineering. Therefore, our aim was to study the contribution of collagen amount and number of crosslinks on the functionality of newly formed matrix during cartilage repair. MethodsBovine articular chondrocytes were cultured in alginate beads. Collagen network formation was modulated using the crosslink inhibitor β-aminopropionitrile (BAPN; 0. 25 mM). Constructs were cultured for 10 weeks with/without BAPN or for 5 weeks with BAPN followed by 5 weeks without. Collagen deposition, number of crosslinks and susceptibility to degradation by matrix metalloproteinase- 1 (MMP- 1) were examined. Mechanical properties of the constructs were determined by unconfined compression. ResultsBAPN for 5 weeks increased collagen deposition accompanied by increased construct stiffness, despite the absence of crosslinks. BAPN for 10 weeks further increased collagen amounts. Absence of collagen crosslinks did not affect stiffness but ability to hold water was lower and susceptibility to MMP-mediated degradation was increased. Removal of BAPN after 5 weeks increased collagen amounts, allowed crosslink <b>formation</b> and increased <b>stiffness.</b> DiscussionThis study demonstrates that both collagen amounts and its proper crosslinking are important for a functional cartilage matrix. Even in conditions with elevated collagen deposition, crosslinks are needed to provide matrix stiffness. Crosslinks also contribute to the ability to hold water and to the resistance against degradation by MMP- 1...|$|R
