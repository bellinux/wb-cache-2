5|$|Building on the Omega, the SV6 is {{equipped}} with the more powerful <b>High</b> <b>Output</b> variant of the Alloytec V6 engine, coupled to a six-speed manual or five-speed automatic transmission. Air conditioning, a key feature missing on the launch Omega, came standard on the SV6. A body kit and sports suspension similar to the V8 Commodore SS/SS V variants is also fitted. The SV6 sports the Performance interior look, characterised by an accentuated matte black centre console and red lighting, {{as opposed to the}} silver Functional-style interior of the Omega.|$|E
5|$|Like the Berlina, the Calais {{retains the}} {{features}} of the outgoing model but at a lower price point. Offering a blend of luxury and sporting character, it pairs the <b>High</b> <b>Output</b> Alloytec V6 engine of the SV6 with the five-speed automatic transmission. Unlike the previous model Calais which featured a semi-sport suspension setup known as FE1.5, the VE shares the Commodore SS/SS V stiff sports suspension. Like the SS, an upscale V-Series edition is available. Being the flagship of the Commodore range, it comes with everything the VE has to offer and serves as a stepping stone to the luxury long-wheelbase Statesman/Caprice range based on the VE. The Calais (as well as Berlina) are the only models in the range to feature larger tail-lights.|$|E

25|$|The S2000 has {{received}} much praise from critics and motoring journalists and {{has received}} favourable reviews from such publications as Car and Driver. Highlighted are the <b>high</b> <b>output</b> of the engine, the high redline, the balanced handling, and the smooth gearbox.

25|$|Regular {{cyclical}} {{lighting is}} used in aquariums to simulate day and night. This is beneficial for fish and invertebrates since it establishes a routine, enables them to rest, and makes them feel more secure. Aside from establishing a routine, <b>high</b> <b>output</b> lighting is required for many invertebrates such as corals and anemones to survive. Lighting in marine tanks that contain only fish and live rock is not an important issue. In aquariums containing invertebrates, however, where algal growth (of both free-living and symbiotic algae) is desired, more intense lighting is required. Various light sources include {{but are not limited}} to: natural sunlight, fluorescent, VHO fluorescent (Very <b>High</b> <b>Output),</b> T-5 fluorescent, compact fluorescent, LED and metal halide. Each type of lighting has its own advantages and disadvantages. They all vary in initial cost, maintenance cost, spectrum obtainable, longevity, efficiency, and power.|$|E
25|$|The dairy {{industry}} is a constantly evolving business. Management practices change with new technology and regulations that move the industry toward increased economic and environmental sustainability. Management strategies can also loosely be divided into intensive and extensive systems. Extensive systems operate based on a low input and low output philosophy, where intensive systems adopt a high input <b>high</b> <b>output</b> philosophy. These philosophies as well as available technologies, local regulations, and environmental conditions manifest in different management of nutrition, housing, health, reproduction and waste.|$|E

25|$|During {{ordinary}} operation, the tungsten of the filament evaporates; hotter, more-efficient filaments evaporate faster. Because of this, {{the lifetime}} of a filament lamp is a trade-off between efficiency and longevity. The trade-off is typically set to provide a lifetime of several hundred to 2,000 hours for lamps used for general illumination. Theatrical, photographic, and projection lamps may have a useful life {{of only a few}} hours, trading life expectancy for <b>high</b> <b>output</b> in a compact form. Long-life general service lamps have lower efficiency but are used where the cost of changing the lamp is high compared to the value of energy used.|$|E
25|$|When {{the mine}} was {{returned}} to the company in June 1944, production was scaled down and thirty men were discharged. The manager began to plan how best to work the mine {{to keep it in}} profit, while making sure no ore reserves would be lost when the mine did close. Everything possible was done to control costs and maximise income. But this was not the <b>high</b> <b>output</b> mine the Basinghall Mining Syndicate had seen itself running, and they announced production would cease in 1946. However, in the year to September 1946 the mine made its best profit to date, of £19,926. A steady development programme kept production constant, and with a good lead price the company was content to leave the mine open.|$|E
25|$|The PT Cruiser GT (also {{known as}} the GT Cruiser) is a <b>high</b> <b>output</b> {{turbocharged}} hot hatch variant of the PT Cruiser introduced as a 2003 model. Much like the Dodge Neon SRT-4 sedan, the PT Cruiser GT uses the same 2.4L turbocharged I4 engine. The engine is upgraded over the standard PT with improved cooling, oiling, an aluminum cylinder block with steel sleeves, and forged internals. The PT Cruiser GT is much {{more powerful than the}} standard model and has the potential to make significantly more power with available and relatively simple performance upgrades. Upgrades such as MOPAR Stage 1 and supporting turbo components are common. Most performance parts from the Dodge Neon SRT-4 are compatible with the PT Cruiser GT.|$|E

25|$|Parabolic Aluminized Reflector lights, or PAR lights, or PAR cans, {{are used}} when a {{substantial}} amount of flat lighting is required for a scene. A PAR can is a sealed beam PAR lamp housed in a simple can-like unit. Like an old-fashioned automotive headlight, the reflector is integral to the lamp and the beam spread of the unit is not adjustable except by changing the lamp. PAR lamps are widely used in architectural lighting and may often be found at hardware stores. PAR lights have seen heavy use in rock and roll shows, especially those with smaller budgets, due to their low cost, light weight, easy maintenance, high durability, and <b>high</b> <b>output.</b> They are often used in combination with smoke or haze machines which make the path of the beam visible. They are also often used as top, back, or side lights in the theatre and for special effects.|$|E
25|$|Input current: Due to biasing {{requirements}} or leakage, a {{small amount}} of current (typically ~10 nanoamperes for bipolar op-amps, tens of picoamperes (pA) for JFET input stages, and only a few pA for MOSFET input stages) flows into the inputs. When large resistors or sources with <b>high</b> <b>output</b> impedances are used in the circuit, these small currents can produce large unmodeled voltage drops. If the input currents are matched, and the impedance looking out of both inputs are matched, then the voltages produced at each input will be equal. Because the operational amplifier operates on the difference between its inputs, these matched voltages will have no effect. It is more common for the input currents to be slightly mismatched. The difference is called input offset current, and even with matched resistances a small offset voltage (different from the input offset voltage below) can be produced. This offset voltage can create offsets or drifting in the operational amplifier.|$|E
25|$|The Ford Taurus SHO (Super <b>High</b> <b>Output)</b> is a {{high-performance}} {{variant of the}} Taurus that was introduced in 1989. Although it shared the same basic design of the Taurus, it had a different drivetrain, a different engine developed by Yamaha, {{as well as many}} cosmetic differences on both the exterior and interior. The SHO was not initially intended to be produced when the Taurus was first developed; it was produced after Ford shelved a vehicle in development that was intended to compete with the Pontiac Fiero and Toyota MR2 replacing the Ford EXP, and needed to use up engines that were developed for this car by Yamaha, which Ford was under contract to use. Because of this, the SHO was initially intended to be a limited production model to be produced only in 1989, of which Ford advertised it as. However, the SHO proved to be surprisingly popular, convincing Ford to order more engines and make the SHO a series production model. The SHO was sold until 1991, when it was replaced by a second generation of Taurus SHO.|$|E
