40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a new theory}} of Dark Matter is proposed. Experimental {{analysis}} of several Galaxies show how the non-gravitational contribution to galactic Velocity Rotation Curves {{can be interpreted as}} that due to the Cosmological Constant Λ. The experimentally determined values for Λ are found to be consistent with those expected from Cosmological Constraints. The Cosmological Constant is interpreted as leading to a constant energy density which in turn can be used to partly address the energy deficit problem (Dark Energy) of the Universe. The work presented here leads {{to the conclusion that the}} Cosmological Constant is negative and that the universe is de-accelerating. This is in clear contradiction to the Type Ia Supernovae results which support an accelerating universe.

40|$|Relativistic jets carry {{energy and}} {{particles}} from compact to very large scales {{compared with their}} initial radius. This is possible due to their remarkable collimation despite their intrinsic unstable nature. In this contribution, I review the state-of-the-art of our knowledge on instabilities growing in those jets and several stabilising mechanisms that may give {{an answer to the}} question of the stability of jets. In particular, during the last years we have learned that the limit imposed by the speed of light sets a maximum amplitude to the instabilities, contrary to the case of classical jets. On top of this stabilising mechanism, the fast growth of unstable modes with small wavelengths prevents the total disruption and entrainment of jets. I also review several non-linear processes that can have an effect on the collimation of extragalactic and microquasar jets. Within those, I remark possible causes for the decollimation and <b>decelleration</b> of FRI jets, as opposed to the collimated FRII's. Finally, I give a summary of the main reasons why jets can propagate through such long distances.
