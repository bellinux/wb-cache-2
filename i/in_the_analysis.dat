For example, several peptide drugs, such as Bortezomib and MG132, are artificially synthesized and retain their protecting groups, which have specific codes. Bortezomib is Pyz-Phe-boroLeu, and MG132 is Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-al. To aid <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>analysis</b> of protein structure, photo-reactive amino acid analogs are available.

5|$|In {{automatic}} test pattern generation, finding cliques {{can help to}} bound {{the size of a}} test set. In bioinformatics, clique-finding algorithms have been used to infer evolutionary trees, predict protein structures, and find closely interacting clusters of proteins.

In mathematics, Keller's conjecture on face-to-face tiling of hypercubes was disproved by , who used a clique-finding algorithm on an associated graph to find a counterexample.|$|E

40|$|The {{study was}} {{designed}} to identify factors that could predict response to chemotherapy in breast cancer. A total of 173 patients with measurable or evaluable metastatic breast cancer were enrolled in a randomized trial between November 1987 and January 1991 to receive a monthly dose of 5 -fluorouracil (500 mg m(- 2)), epirubicin (60 mg m(- 2)) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg m(- 2)) either administered in four weekly doses or in an every- 4 -week dose as first-line cytotoxic treatment. In 103 evaluable patients we performed a multivariate <b>analysis</b> of <b>the</b> tumour biological factors, i. e. histological grade, oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), S-phase fraction (SPF), ploidy, p 53, c-erbB- 2, Bcl- 2 and Bax expression, which showed significance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> univariate <b>analysis</b> according to treatment response, time to progression (TTP) or overall survival (OS). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> univariate <b>analysis</b> only SPF, grade and the proapoptotic protein Bax correlated with the response to cytotoxic treatment. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> multivariate <b>analysis</b> SPF had <b>the</b> strongest correlation, followed by grade and Bax. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> univariate <b>analysis</b> grade, PR, Bax and Bcl- 2 correlated significantly with TTP, whereas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> multivariate <b>analysis</b> only PR showed a statistically significant correlation. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> univariate <b>analysis</b> PR and Bax correlated with OS and both retained its significance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> multivariate <b>analysis.</b> <b>The</b> factors that correlated significantly with the response to cytotoxic treatment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> univariate <b>analysis,</b> i. e. grade, SPF and Bax, seemed to predict independently the response to treatment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> multivariate <b>analysis</b> also. TTP and OS could be predicted partly by the same factors, although the association was quite weak. More studies and new tumour biological factors are needed to identify the group of breast cancer patients who get the most benefit from chemotherapy...|$|R

5|$|Additional {{factors that}} affect the BFO are a {{translation}} made at the ground station between the reception and processing of the signal (which is monitored and can be factored in) and a fixed bias in the aircraft and satellite oscillators due to drift and ageing (which can be calibrated by measures recorded when the aircraft's location and speed were known). At 2:40 and 6:14, ground-to-aircraft phone calls were made that were unanswered by the cockpit but acknowledged by the SDU. The signals associated with these calls could not be analysed to generate a BTO value, but BFO values of these signals can be considered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>analysis</b> with the other BTO and BFO data.|$|E
5|$|Logarithms {{have many}} {{applications}} {{inside and outside}} mathematics. Some of these occurrences {{are related to the}} notion of scale invariance. For example, each chamber of the shell of a nautilus is an approximate copy of the next one, scaled by a constant factor. This gives rise to a logarithmic spiral. Benford's law on the distribution of leading digits can also be explained by scale invariance. Logarithms are also linked to self-similarity. For example, logarithms appear <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>analysis</b> of algorithms that solve a problem by dividing it into two similar smaller problems and patching their solutions. The dimensions of self-similar geometric shapes, that is, shapes whose parts resemble the overall picture are also based on logarithms.|$|E

5|$|Phase {{contrast}} and {{differential interference contrast}} (DIC) microscopy are important tools in biology and medicine. Most animal cells and single-celled organisms have very little color, and their intracellular organelles are almost totally invisible under simple bright field illumination. These structures can be made visible by staining the specimens, but staining procedures are time-consuming and kill the cells. As seen in Figs.24 and25, phase {{contrast and}} DIC microscopes allow unstained, living cells to be studied.
