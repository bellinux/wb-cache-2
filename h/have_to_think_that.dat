500|$|In a {{negative}} review, Betsey Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times panned the [...] "overwhelmingly complicated, globe-hopping, enemies within, enemies without story line" [...] and 3D but noted that [...] "the humor, when it works, offers 'Retaliation' some redemption." [...] She ended with: [...] "It's convoluted. Frankly {{no one should}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{hard to keep up}} with the Joes." [...] Another negative review came from Variety Magazines Justin Chang, who ridiculed the movie's large-scale destruction of foreign cities, writing: [...] "Audiences who thrilled to the sight of Paris under biochemical attack in Cobra will be pleased to watch London endure an even more horrific fate here, although the sequence is tossed off in quick, almost ho-hum fashion, with no time to dwell on anything so exquisitely crass as the spectacle of the Eiffel Tower collapsing." [...] He summarized the movie as [...] "a more straight-faced brand of idiocy than its cheerfully dumb 2009 predecessor." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Miss Amy, pray! Will {{you have}} the {{goodness}} to stop a moment? Miss Amy, {{if it comes to}} that, let ME go. I shall go out of my senses, if I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I have driven you away like this.' ...|$|E
50|$|In Hueypoxtla {{has been}} found fossils of plants and animal species from the Cretaceous. Don't found evidences in this {{municipality}} about human groups, but the proximity with Tequixquiac municipality, place where the sacrum bone was found, <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> humans inhabited this region.|$|R

6000|$|What ground can a man have {{to believe}} that Christ is his Saviour, if he do not believe that He {{suffered}} for sin in his nature? And what ground also can a man <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> God the Father is satisfied, being infinite, if he believe not also that He who gave the satisfaction was equal to Him who was offended? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For my sake {{you must}} stay here, Larry;--so that I may not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I have injured you so deeply. Larry, though I cannot be your wife I think I could die of sorrow {{if you were}} always unhappy. What is a poor girl that you should grieve for her in that way? I think if I were a man I would master my love better than that." [...] He {{shook his head and}} faintly strove to drag his arm from out of her grasp. [...] "Promise me that you will take a year to think of it before you go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not care}} to trust to such {{influences}} as that, Cissy. If he could not spend this morning with her in her own house, and then, as he left her, feel that he preferred me to her, and to all the world, I would rather be as I am than take his hand. He shall not marry me from pity, nor yet {{from a sense of}} duty. We know the old story--how the Devil would be a monk when he was sick. I will not accept his sick-bed allegiance, or <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I owe my husband to a mother's influence over him while he is ill." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] she answered; {{and he felt}} absurdly disappointed. He would <b>have</b> liked <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{his work}} <b>had</b> helped her <b>to</b> sing.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was a most}} disagreeable child, perverse,--cantankerous--I {{can hear}} my mother saying it! As for the gardens--they have given me {{something}} <b>to</b> do, they <b>have</b> kept me out of mischief. I suppose I ought to be thankful, but I still have the rebellious streak when I see what others have done, what others are doing, and I sometimes wonder what right I ever <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I might create something worth while." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Every {{precaution}} {{is still}} necessary," [...] he whispered. [...] "I <b>have</b> reason <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> they are hot upon our trail. Ah, there is Moriarty himself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps I am, {{and very}} {{unreasonable}} into the bargain. I ought to ask no {{questions of the}} kind when your brother proposes to do me so much honour. As for my expecting {{the love of a}} man who condescends to wish to be my husband, that, of course, would be monstrous. What right can I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> any man should love me? It ought to be enough for me to know that as I am rich, I can get a husband. What business can such as I have to inquire whether the gentleman who would so honour me really would like my company, or would only deign to put up with my presence in his household?" ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{something}} {{to see that he}} still recognised the law, though he was so meanly anxious to evade it. There had been some whisperings in the empire among the elderly men and women of a desire to obtain the assistance of Great Britain in setting it aside. Peter Grundle, for instance, Crasweller's senior partner, had been heard to say that England would not allow a deposited man to be slaughtered. There was much in that which had angered me. The word slaughter was in itself peculiarly objectionable to my ears,--to me who had undertaken to perform the first ceremony as an act of grace. And what had England to do with our laws? It was as though Russia were to turn upon the United States and declare that their Congress should be put down. What would avail the loudest voice of Great Britain against the smallest spark of a law passed by our Assembly?--unless, indeed, Great Britain should condescend to avail herself of her great power, and thus to crush the free voice of those whom she had already recognised as independent. As I now write, this is what she has already done, and history will have to tell the story. But it was especially sad to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> there should be a Britannulist so base, such a coward, such a traitor, as himself to propose this expedient for adding a few years to his own wretched life.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would not}} have father believe that my health has aught to do with it. You know,--you know what right I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I am fit to marry and to hope to be the mother of children. It needs not that he should know. Let it suffice {{for him to be}} told that I am not equal to this greatness. A word escaped me in {{speaking}} to him, and I repent myself that I so spoke to him. But tell him,--and tell him truly,--that were my days fixed here for the next fifty years, were I sure of the rudest health, I would not carry my birth, my manners, my habits into that young lord's house. How long would it be, Mrs. Roden, before he saw some little trick that would displease him? Some word would be wrongly spoken, some garment would be ill-folded, some awkward movement would tell the tale,--and then he would feel that he had done wrong to marry the Quaker's daughter. All the virtues under the sun cannot bolster up love so as to stand the battery of one touch of disgust. Tell my father that, and tell him that I have done well. Then you can tell him also, that, if God shall so choose it, I shall live a strong old maid for many years, to think night and day of his goodness to me,--of his great love." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, from a man's feet, lad. I <b>had</b> reason <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{he might}} not need them again, seeing that a thirty-inch shaft had {{feathered}} in his back." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then came, in a postscript, the {{one thing}} <b>that</b> she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> say,--"I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I ought <b>to</b> be allowed to see Mr. Daniel Thwaite." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And suppose I <b>have</b> grounds <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> he can't {{take care}} of himself in a given instance." [...] She hesitated in a funny, bashful manner which roused my interest. Then: ...|$|R
60|$|So she {{intended}} to escape from him! But he also would escape from her. After all, what an infinite trouble would a wife be to him,--especially a wife of whose docility in harness he was not quite assured. But there came upon him as he rode home an idea {{that the world would}} say that he had been jilted. Of course he would have been jilted, but there would be nothing in that except as the world might speak of it. It was gall to him to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the world of Exeter should believe that Cecilia Holt had changed her mind, and had sent him about his business. If the world of Exeter would say that he had ill-used the girl, and had broken off the engagement for mere fancy,--as she had done,--that would be much more endurable. He could not say that such was the case. To so palpable a lie the contradiction would be easy and disgraceful. But could he not so tell the story as to leave a doubt on the minds of the people? That question of another lover had not been contradicted. Thinking of it again as he rode home he began to feel that the lover must be true, and that her conduct in breaking off the engagement had been the consequence. There had been some complication in the way of which she had been unable to rid herself. At any rate it was quite out of the question that he should have held himself to such an engagement, complicated as it would have been with such a lover. There would be some truth, therefore, in so telling the story as to leave the matter in doubt, and in doubt he resolved that he would leave it. Before he got back to the Deanery he was, he thought, thoroughly glad that he should have been enabled so easily to slip his neck out of the collar.|$|E
60|$|Secondly, Another great {{cause of}} ignorance is the want of ideas we are capable of. As the want of ideas which our faculties {{are not able}} to give us shuts us wholly from those views of things which it is {{reasonable}} to think other beings, perfecter than we, have, of which we know nothing; so the want of ideas I now speak of keeps us in ignorance of things we conceive capable of being known to us. Bulk, figure, and motion we have ideas of. But though we are not without ideas of these primary qualities of bodies in general, yet not knowing what is the particular bulk, figure, and motion, of the greatest part of the bodies of the universe, we are ignorant of the several powers, efficacies, and ways of operation, whereby the effects which we daily see are produced. These are hid from us, in some things by being too remote, and in others by being too minute. When we consider the vast distance of the known and visible parts of the world, and the reasons we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> what lies within our ken is but {{a small part of the}} universe, we shall then discover a huge abyss of ignorance. What are the particular fabrics of the great masses of matter which make up the whole stupendous frame of corporeal beings; how far they are extended; what is their motion, and how continued or communicated; and what influence they have one upon another, are contemplations that at first glimpse our thoughts lose themselves in. If we narrow our contemplations, and confine our thoughts to this little canton--I mean this system of our sun, and the grosser masses of matter that visibly move about it, What several sorts of vegetables, animals, and intellectual corporeal beings, infinitely different from those of our little spot of earth, may there probably be in the other planets, to the knowledge of which, even of their outward figures and parts, we can no way attain whilst we are confined to this earth; there being no natural means, either by sensation or reflection, to convey their certain ideas into our minds? They are out of the reach of those inlets of all our knowledge: and what sorts of furniture and inhabitants those mansions contain in them we cannot so much as guess, much less have clear and distinct ideas of them.|$|E
5000|$|Asked {{about the}} band's future plans, Bachmann {{did not rule}} out a new album, but noted {{that it is not}} {{something}} that is on the immediate horizon following the reunion tour. [...] "The worst thing of Loaf could do is force something out and have it be a bad version of something we already did. It's {{going to have to be}} a forward step. I don't want to recreate the 25-year-old kid writing the songs that I would do now with those three other guys, so we'd <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> through. They're very good to work with, in that way. It's not out of the question, because everyone thinks the same way. No one wants to do 'Icky Mettle 2.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I <b>have</b> reason <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{when you}} came into this room,” he said in {{measured}} tones, “it was not Michaelis who was in your mind; not principally—perhaps not at all.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{employment}} {{will you}} take in hand? One <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of <b>that,</b> and <b>to</b> live accordingly. If {{you would like to}} turn farmer, we must live in the country." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>have</b> reason <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{there is}} an unfrequented ruin at no great {{distance}} from us," [...] said Griffith; [...] "perhaps we might find both shelter and privacy among its deserted walls." ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with the Fiji Times on 29 May 2005, Americas outgoing Ambassador David Lyons renewed his countrys criticism of Fijian policies by criticizing the Qarase governments proposed Reconciliation and Unity Commission. Lyons expressed concern that its provisions for amnesty for persons convicted of involvement in the coup detat that overthrew the elected government in 2000 would encourage further coups in the future. [...] "If a democratic society doesnt make it clear that the violent over-throw of its elected leaders is a crime against that society, I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it is inviting future upheaval," [...] he said. [...] He also condemned statements of public figures predicting coups if they, their party, or their race is not successful in the next parliamentary election, saying that such threats were [...] "absolutely despicable in a free, democratic society" [...] and constituted [...] "the worst form of scaremongering." ...|$|E
5000|$|There {{were many}} people in modern times, Stove thought, who hold such beliefs - {{that in the past}} the world was a dark place run {{according}} to foolish principles, but that from now on things will be run properly and the world will be vastly improved as a result. But, he asked, what reason do we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> darkness is about to suddenly give way to light? Why is it that we will be so much better at running things than past generations? [...] "Education" [...] is the answer that is often given in reply to this question, but Stove was deeply sceptical about the effectiveness of education in making the world a better place. Stove felt that learning has great value in itself, but unlike Plato did not think that the more educated a ruler is the better he will be at ruling.|$|E

5000|$|PopMatters' Eric Brown, on {{the other}} hand, gave the album a more mixed review, writing [...] "Beirut too often moves away from its world-folk origins into a more generic sound, one that has {{more in common with}} an Apple {{commercial}} than their breakthrough album. It's not necessarily a bad move — the songs are all well-composed and technically challenging — but The Rip Tide lacks an emotional core, or at the very least, an interesting hook in lieu of something more substantial." [...] Brown continued: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> as an EP, The Rip Tide would be a rousing success. But as it is, {{there are just too many}} bland, uninspiring tracks that drag down the whole experience." [...] Benjamin Boles of NOW was also less receptive to the album's sound, writing [...] "Unfortunately, it all feels a bit too manicured and restrained. As easy as it is to hit repeat when the disc ends, trying to remember standout moments is another story. It’s a solid album, but too conservative to make many converts." ...|$|E
5000|$|One of his {{well-known}} discoveries {{is the art}} of Stucco, that Giovanni was the [...] "new-founder" [...] of after antiquity: {{occasioned by}} the discovery of the Domus Aurea, Nero's residence near the Colosseum: {{in the first year of}} the 16th century Raphael and his students went down [...] "Mons Coelius" [...] into tunnels that were formed to explore that area. With candles and torches they explored the caves and looked at the walls onto which were painted little heavy coloured figures that were named [...] "grottesche (pl.), grottesca (s.)" [...] because in the darkness, these images seemed like paint in ancient caves that in Italian was -and is- said like above. There was a strange [...] "pictorial relief" [...] onto which some of this [...] "grottesche" [...] were realised: it was Roman stucco, an important technique that the ancient Romans utilised to reproduce a marble effect, real marble was already too expensive by that time even for the Imperator (we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> there were all a [...] "Domus" [...] in marble, for a size as like as a range of KM 1.5 - 2 around Colosseum, it was the most famous residence of the Roman Empire).|$|E
30|$|Another {{selected}} {{lesson that}} has the Title: Thinking about time consumption in the project activities, which occurred {{as shown by the}} following Situation: “Benefits in activities that consumed design time and were not well understood by the participants”. The analysis and design team defined the following Action strategy: “Participants <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> when there is no interface pattern, starting with the interaction modeling makes sense”. Therefore, the analysis and design team concluded that the use of initial interaction modeling is useful to understand the system’s functionalities.
