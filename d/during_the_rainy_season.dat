5|$|Bangui is the {{transport}} {{hub of the}} Central African Republic. As of 1999, eight roads connected the city to other main towns in the country, Cameroon, Chad and South Sudan; of these, only the toll roads are paved. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>season</b> from July to October, some roads are impassable. The road network in the city emanates from the Palace de la Republique.|$|E
5|$|Maraba's coffee {{plants are}} the Bourbon {{variety of the}} Coffea arabica species and are grown on fertile {{volcanic}} soils on high-altitude hills. The fruit is handpicked, mostly <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>season</b> between March and May, and brought to a washing station in Maraba, where the coffee beans are extracted and dried. At several stages, the beans are sorted according to quality. The farmers receive credits based on the amount {{and quality of the}} beans they provide.|$|E
5|$|Ominously, PAVN and the Pathet Lao did not {{withdraw}} to North Vietnam <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>season.</b> Previously during the conflict, air mobility by STOL aircraft into the Lima Sites had provided the Hmong with {{an advantage over}} the road-bound PAVN and Pathet Lao forces.

5|$|Common elands are herbivores that browse during drier {{winter months}} but have also adapted to grazing <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>season</b> when grasses are more common. They require a high-protein diet of {{succulent}} leaves from flowering plants but will consume lower quality plant material if available including forbs, trees, shrubs, grasses, seeds and tubers. The eland can conserve water by increasing its body temperature. Grasses the eland eats include Setaria and Themeda and fruits from Securinega and Strychnos. Large antelope can survive on lower quality food {{in times of}} little rain. Elands feed during the night in hot weather and sleep for long periods during the day.|$|E
5|$|In {{their design}} of the reductions, the Jesuits were {{inspired}} by “ideal cities“ as outlined in works such as Utopia and Arcadia, written respectively by the 16th-century English philosophers Thomas More and Philip Sidney. The Jesuits had specific criteria for building sites: locations with plenty of wood for construction; sufficient water for the population; good soil for agriculture; and safety from flooding <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>season.</b> Although most of the missions in the Chiquitania were relocated at least once {{during the time of}} the Jesuits, four of ten towns remained at their original sites. Wood and adobe were the main materials used in the construction of the settlements.|$|E
5|$|Key {{protein sources}} include birds and tenrecs. Mikea adults and {{children}} of both sexes use clubs to kill the small tenrec (tambotrika, 0.4 kilograms), which is widespread year round, and the larger one (tandraka, 2-3 kilograms), which is mainly caught <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>season.</b> To a lesser extent they also hunt or trap two to three species of lemur, feral cats, occasional wild boars, turtles and rodents using blowguns, spears and dogs, and use a hook and line to catch fish in saline inland lakes. Some Mikea raise animals for food or sale at market, including goats, chickens and guinea fowl; tree nuts also provide additional protein.|$|E
40|$|Surface runoff and {{sediment}} production from different timber yarding practices, some using Best Management Practices (BMPs) recommended for Honduras, were monitored in experimental plots <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>seasons</b> of two consecutive years in pine forest highlands of central Honduras. Different timber yarding systems {{were applied to}} pseudo-replicated plots <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>seasons</b> of 1999 and 2000. In 1999, two treatments were studied: tractor yarding and skyline cable (a recommended BMP). In 2000, four treatments were evaluated: tractor skidding, skyline cable, animal skidding (another recommended BMP), and undisturbed forest (reference). During <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>seasons</b> of these years, surface runoff volumes {{and sediment}} yield were measured at five 1. 5 m x 10 m erosion plots in each treated area. The results showed significant differences between traditional tractor yarding and the recommended skyline cable and animal skidding methods. Tractor yarding produced six to ten times more erosion <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>seasons</b> than cable and animal yarding. The improved soil retention of cable and animal yarding was especially important <b>during</b> September when <b>the</b> highest rainfall occurred in this climate...|$|R
50|$|C. afra are insectivorous bats {{feeding on}} a range of insects but {{particularly}} coleoptera and lepidoptera. Feeding is strongly dependent on the season with much greater feeding activity occurring <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>seasons.</b>|$|R
50|$|The lake {{measures}} around 182 acres <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>seasons.</b> During dry periods on {{the arid}} island, the shallow lake shrinks due to effect of evaporation. Other sources {{give it the}} measurement of 371 acres.|$|R
5|$|The arid {{conditions}} of the spiny forest, which receives less than 600 millimeters of rainfall each year, largely shape Mikea economic activities. Nearly everything they consume is scavenged from the forest, and the average Mikea needs two hours or less to collect adequate food for the day. Their main source of food is tubers, particularly {{during the dry season}} when few other foods may be reliably available. Adults and children of both genders work to dig up using a metal-tipped digging stick (antsoro) and a digging bowl (kipao). The starchy ovy tuber is roasted or boiled before eating, while the Mikea eat the watery babo (or baboho) raw for hydration or use its water for boiling other foods; the tavolo tuber is dried and ground to make a flour that is sold at village markets. They also gather forest fruits, melons and honey, with the latter a particularly important source of income for the Mikea <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>season.</b> To obtain water <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>season</b> the Mikea capture rain run-off from the rooftops of their houses using hollowed-out logs or transport water on foot or zebu-drawn wagon from the villages, while during the cool dry season the Mikea consume their store of water-engorged babo tubers and drink water from natural or man-made wells when possible.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} part of the commune is hilly but relatively favorable to agriculture, while the southern part is flat and characterized by sand dunes. Sixteen caves are found within the area. The earth is mainly composed of stony rocks, sandy loam soils, and clay loam soils in the beds of wadis in the area. The soils in the hills have pockets of alluvium and sandy loam suitable for crop development, particularly on the hillsides and {{at the foot of the}} hills. Clay loam soils are found in the bowls and beds of wadis, which although suitable for farming are susceptible to gully and water erosion <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>season.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{rocks are}} home to over 70 species of animals and 340 species of plants, which {{includes}} over 200 species of wildflowers. Vernal pools atop the plateaus fill <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>season</b> in winter and spring because the andesite is impermeable. The dwarf woolly meadowfoam, a species of wildflower, grows around these pools, and is endemic to the rocks. The pools are also {{one of only a}} few places where the federally threatened species of fairy shrimp, Branchinecta lynchi, can be found. To protect these and other threatened species, the Bureau of Land Management has listed the rocks as an Area of Critical Environmental Concern since 1984.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{document}} the diversity and distribution of macrofungi in the Mount Cameroon Region. These were assessed at low and high altitudinal ranges in the four flanks of <b>the</b> mountain <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> and early dry seasons of 2010 and 2011. A total of 177 macrofungal species belonging to 83 genera and 38 families were recorded. Species richness was higher in <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>seasons</b> (134 species) than in the early dry seasons (89 species) and tended to decrease with altitude, with 116 and 112 species for low and high altitudes, respectively. Eighty-eight species were recorded only in <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>seasons,</b> 43 species in the early dry seasons only, and 46 species were common to both seasons. Sixty-five species were found only in the low altitude, 61 species only in the high altitude, and 51 species were common to both altitudes. Auricularia auricular was the most abundant species <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>seasons,</b> while Coltricia cinnamomea was rare <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>seasons,</b> and <b>the</b> most abundant <b>during</b> <b>the</b> dry seasons. Six of the 12 morpho-groups identified occurred across the sites, with the gilled fungi being the most frequent. Cyathus striatus was found only in Buea Town <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>seasons.</b> <b>The</b> study established that macrofungal diversity is threatened in the Mount Cameroon Region and needs for conservation measures especially for edible and medicinal species...|$|R
5|$|An even {{checkerboard}} plot model {{dominates the}} green landscape <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>season,</b> which becomes more austere after harvest. The rice fields differ {{only in terms}} of soil type and location. Where mangroves are populous, such as in Carabane, the rice paddy fields between them must be protected from the channels of saltwater which overflow during high tide. Rice farmers must therefore build levees, dig ditches, and create ponds. The fish and shrimp which subsequently become trapped are harvested {{at the end of the}} rainy season, when the basins are emptied. The plots of land which were safeguarded from flooding are then cleared and ploughed. Several years of drainage are required to desalinate the soil.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} thirty, Mahavira {{abandoned}} the comforts of royal life and left his home and family to live an ascetic life {{in the pursuit of}} spiritual awakening. He undertook severe austerities of fasting and bodily mortifications, meditated under the Ashoka tree, and discarded his clothes. There is a graphic description of his hardships and humiliation in the Acharanga Sutra. According to the Kalpa Sūtra, Mahavira spent the first forty-two monsoons of his life at Astikagrama, Champapuri, Prstichampa, Vaishali, Vanijagrama, Nalanda, Mithila, Bhadrika, Alabhika, Panitabhumi, Shravasti, and Pawapuri. He is said to have lived in Rajagriha <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>season</b> of the forty-first year of his ascetic life. This is traditionally dated to have been in 491BC.|$|E
5|$|Some species, {{such as the}} Uruguayan Hippeastrum petiolatum, are sterile {{and unable}} to produce seeds. H. petiolatum is a sterile {{triploid}} that reproduces asexually, producing many bulbils around the mother bulb. These are light, and easily carried {{on the surface of}} water ensuring distribution of the species <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>season.</b> Other species such as Hippeastrum reticulatum are self-pollinating, reproducing by distributing seed. Although this does not guarantee genetic diversity in natural populations, it is widely used by colonising species. These two examples are not however typical of the genus, which commonly reproduces through allogamy. One mechanism that limits self-pollination is that of self-incompatibility by which seeds are only produced by pollination from other plants. Furthermore, the plant generally releases its pollen about two days before its stigma is receptive, making cross-pollination more likely. Pollinators include Humming birds in subtropical areas, and moths.|$|E

5|$|Springbok mate year-round, though {{females are}} more likely to enter oestrus <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>season,</b> when food is more plentiful. Females are able to {{conceive}} at as early as six to seven months, whereas males do not attain sexual maturity until two years; rut lasts 5 to 21 days. When a female approaches a rutting male, the male holds his head and tail at level with the ground, lowers his horns, and makes a loud grunting noise to attract her. The male then urinates and sniffs the female's perineum. If the female is receptive, she urinates, as well, and the male makes a flehmen gesture, and taps his leg till the female leaves or permits him to mate. Copulation consists of a single pelvic thrust.|$|E
5|$|Each year, some East African {{populations of}} blue {{wildebeest}} have a long-distance migration, seemingly timed {{to coincide with}} the annual pattern of rainfall and grass growth. The timing of their migrations in both the rainy and dry seasons can vary considerably (by months) from year to year. At the end of the wet season (May or June in East Africa), wildebeest migrate to dry-season areas in response to a lack of surface (drinking) water. When the rainy season begins again (months later), animals quickly move back to their wet-season ranges. Factors suspected to affect migration include food abundance, surface water availability, predators, and phosphorus content in grasses. Phosphorus is a crucial element for all life forms, particularly for lactating female bovids. As a result, <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>season,</b> wildebeest select grazing areas that contain particularly high phosphorus levels. One study found, in addition to phosphorus, wildebeest select ranges containing grass with relatively high nitrogen content.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} Viet Cong {{had won a}} clear victory over the regular units of the South Vietnamese army, they did not get away with light casualties. After the battle, a {{combined}} total of 126 Viet Cong bodies were recovered within the Special Forces compound and the district headquarters, and several hundred more were strewn all over the battlefield. Indeed, individual Viet Cong soldiers usually spare no efforts to evacuate their dead or wounded comrades; but as military operations were conducted <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>season,</b> the Viet Cong struggled to evacuate all their casualties from the battlefield as conditions on the main roads deteriorated. Despite the minor setbacks, the Đồng Xoài campaign marked the rapid maturity of the Viet Cong 9th Division as a fighting force. For their efforts during the battle, the Viet Cong 272nd Regiment received the title of 'Đồng Xoài Regiment' to mark their achievements.|$|E
