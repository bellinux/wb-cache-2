5|$|Lord Wardens {{since the}} Second World War have {{included}} Winston Churchill, Robert Menzies and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, {{but they have}} made only <b>intermittent</b> <b>use</b> of Walmer Castle. In the 21st century, Walmer Castle is run as a tourist attraction by English Heritage. The interior of the castle displays a range of historical objects and pictures associated with the property and its Lord Wardens, protected since the 19th century by special legislation. The grounds include the Queen Mother's Garden, designed by Penelope Hobhouse as a 95th birthday gift for Elizabeth in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Carucage was {{an attempt}} to secure new sources of revenue to {{supplement}} existing sources of income. It was also intended to increase the royal revenues in the face of new demands placed upon them. Although derived from the older geld, carucage was an experiment in revenue collection, but it was only levied for specific purposes, rather than as a general tax regularly assessed. A novel feature was the consultation with the barons and other leading members of the ruling classes. Despite its <b>intermittent</b> <b>use</b> during the reigns of Richard I, John, and the early years of Henry III, the main source of royal income at that time remained scutage, feudal dues such as feudal reliefs or feudal aids, and royal rights such as the profits from the justice system.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Carlotta Joaquina, Queluz saw only <b>intermittent</b> <b>use</b> as a royal {{residence}} and was not again the primary residence of Portuguese royalty. Carlotta Joaquina's son King Miguel used the palace during the three-year civil war which he fought against his brother King Pedro IV, before being forced by his brother in 1834 to abdicate and go into exile. A year later, Pedro IV died of tuberculosis {{at the age of}} 35 at Queluz, the palace of his birth. Pedro I's daughter Maria II ruled until her death in 1853 and was succeeded by her son Pedro V. Following his untimely death in the cholera epidemic of 1861, the throne passed to his brother Luís. From this time the royal family lived chiefly at the rebuilt Ajuda Palace in Lisbon. On the assassination of Luís' son Carlos I in 1908, the palace passed into the ownership of the state. Portugal was in the turmoil of revolution and the monarchy fell two years later.|$|E

5|$|The {{response}} to {{the first generation of}} fixed installation surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) such as SA-2 and SA-3 was the development of the anti-radiation missile such as AGM-45 Shrike and other means to attack fixed SAM installations, as well as developing SEAD doctrines. The Soviet counter-response was the use of mobile SAMs such as SA-6 with <b>intermittent</b> <b>use</b> of radar. Thus, the SAM battery was only visible for a small period of time, during which it was also a significant threat to high-value Wild Weasel fighters. In 1982 Operation Mole Cricket 19 various means including UAVs and air-launched Samson decoys were used over suspected SAM areas to saturate enemy SAMs and to bait them to activate their radar systems, which were then attacked by anti-radiation missiles.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{the uniform}} jacket of the Confederate soldier was single breasted, made of gray or brown fabric, with a {{six to nine}} button front. The design of the garment {{featured}} several variations: a four to six piece body, {{and one or two}} piece sleeves, usually with lining, often of a cotton material. The fabric used in these jackets, ranged from the finer kerseys and broadcloths used early in the war, to the cotton/wool blends of jeans, satinette, and cassimere, to name several examples. The exact color of the fabric also ranged from the prewar bright cadet gray, similar to the fabric used by Virginia Military Institute, or West Point U.S. Military Academy dress uniforms, to the sumac and logwood dyed fabrics, that would eventually fade to the ragged butternut appearance. Epaulettes may have been used {{in the construction of the}} jacket, as was the case for the Richmond clothing bureau designed jackets, commonly called today, the Richmond Depot types I, II, and III. Belt loops were also in <b>intermittent</b> <b>use,</b> such as the Richmond and the Charleston clothing depots. Trimming on the jackets range from piped or taped collars, cuffs, and front lapel edges, to full facings on the collar and cuffs, commonly in light blue, dark blue, red, or black. Due to the difficulty in obtaining yellow dye ingredients as the war progressed, yellow was infrequently used by the Cavalry Corps throughout the conflict.|$|E

25|$|The {{zinc sulfate}} layer was clear in {{contrast}} to the deep blue copper sulfate layer, which allowed a technician to measure the battery life with a glance. On the other hand, this setup meant the battery could be used only in a stationary appliance, else the solutions would mix or spill. Another disadvantage was that a current had to be continually drawn to keep the two solutions from mixing by diffusion, so it was unsuitable for <b>intermittent</b> <b>use.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{dry cell}} form {{was used to}} power early telephones—usually from an {{adjacent}} wooden box affixed to the wall—before telephones could draw power from the telephone line itself. The Leclanché cell could not provide a sustained current for very long. In lengthy conversations, the battery would run down, rendering the conversation inaudible. This was because certain chemical reactions in the cell increased the internal resistance and, thus, lowered the voltage. These reactions reversed themselves when the battery was left idle, so it was good only for <b>intermittent</b> <b>use.</b>|$|E
25|$|The zenith of galley usage {{in warfare}} {{came in the}} late 16th century with battles like that at Lepanto in 1571, {{one of the largest}} naval battles ever fought. By the 17th century, however, sailing ships and hybrid ships like the xebec {{displaced}} galleys in naval warfare. They were the most common warships in the Atlantic Ocean during the Middle Ages, and later saw limited use in the Caribbean, the Philippines and the Indian Ocean in the early modern period, mostly as patrol craft to combat pirates. From the mid-16th century galleys were in <b>intermittent</b> <b>use</b> in the Baltic Sea, with its short distances and extensive archipelagoes. There was a minor revival of galley warfare in the 18th century in the wars between Russia, Sweden and Denmark.|$|E

2500|$|There is no {{evidence}} that [...] "drug holidays" [...] or periods of abstinence reduced the risk of dependence; there is evidence from animal studies that such an approach does not prevent dependence from happening. Use of short-acting benzodiazepines is associated with interdose withdrawal symptoms.

2500|$|There is {{critical}} debate over their effect. Helen Vendler proposes that the feminine endings, {{similar to their}} <b>intermittent</b> <b>use</b> in Sonnet 126, parallel [...] "the poet's unwillingness to let the young man go". She notes that 12 of the 14 lines end with feminine rhymes. The movement between feminine and masculine endings, with the feminine endings receiving emphasis, enacts a longing {{on the part of}} the speaker for the young man to stay. Atkins adopts the view that the monotony of the feminine endings creates a somber tone of loss. Lines 2 and 4 are the only lines without feminine endings and they [...] "ending as they do in pyrrhic feet, give the same elegiac effect".|$|E
40|$|Large general-purposed {{community}} question-answering {{sites are}} becoming popular {{as a new}} venue for generating knowledge and helping users in their information needs. In this paper we analyze the characteristics of knowledge generation and user participation behavior in the largest question-answering online community in South Korea, Naver Knowledge–iN. We collected and analyzed over 2. 6 million question/answer pairs from fifteen categories between 2002 and 2007, and have interviewed twenty six users to gain insights into their motivations, roles, usage and expertise. We find altruism, learning, and competency are frequent motivations for top answerers to participate, but that participation is often highly <b>intermittent.</b> <b>Using</b> a simple measure of user performance, we find that higher levels of participation correlate with better performance. We also observe that users are motivated in part through a point system to build a comprehensive knowledge database.

2500|$|Of the {{historical}} {{development of the}} imperial concept in Spain one historian writes that the [...] "constant idea, analogous to that of the German Emperor, of the hierarchical superiority of the Spanish Emperor over the other sovereigns of Spain, the restoration of the Gothic kingdom, the submission of the nobility, the pomp of the court and the fight against Islam [...] is a mere aspiration in Alfonso III, an attempt in Ordoño II and only a reality in Alfonso VI". The historian Roger Collins suggests that [...] "the <b>intermittent</b> <b>use</b> of the title imperator, [...] "emperor", by the rulers of Asturias and León from the tenth century onward seems to have indicated their hegemonial pretentions." ...|$|E
60|$|He had {{received}} another stroke. He {{had lost his}} voice, or he was losing it. He had only <b>intermittent</b> <b>use</b> of it. As he phrased it, the wires were like the stock market, now up, now down. Occasionally the wires were up and he spoke as well as ever, though slowly and heavily. Then speech would suddenly desert him, {{in the middle of}} a sentence perhaps, and for hours, sometimes, we would wait for the connection to be re-established. He complained of great pain in his head, and it was during this period that he arranged a system of communication against the time when speech should leave him altogether—one pressure of the hand for “yes,” two for “no.” It was well that it was arranged, for by evening his voice had gone from him. By hand pressures, after that, he answered our questions, and when he wished to speak he scrawled his thoughts with his left hand, quite legibly, on a sheet of paper.|$|E

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{kinetics}} of denitrification {{was carried out in}} the laboratory based on the quantification of N 2 O, the final product of the activity of denitrifying microorganisms, when the enzymatic reduction of N 2 O to N 2 was blocked by acetylene. Concentrated mixed liquor (sludge from a reactor with <b>intermittent</b> aeration <b>used</b> for sewage treatment) was used as the inoculum, while methanol, acetic acid, glucose, effluent sewage from an anaerobic fluidized bed reactor and synthetic substrate simulating domestic sewage were used as carbon sources. The mean concentration of nitrate was 20 mg/L. Maxima of N 2 O production and NO 3 - consumption occurred between 0. 5 h and 2. 0 h of incubation using all the carbon sources, which characterized the denitrification process. Acetic acid and methanol were responsible for the highest rates of N 2 O production. The estimated number of denitrifying microorganisms in the reactor with <b>intermittent</b> aeration, <b>using</b> the MPN technique, varied from 10 (9) to 10 (10) MPN/g VSS, indicating a high potential for the occurrence of denitrification...|$|R

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{elucidate}} the effect of mixing on the rate and extent of enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulosic substrates, alpha -cellulose was hydrolysed using a commercial cellulase preparation at varying levels of substrate concentration (2. 5, 5 and 7. 5 % (w/v)) and by using three shaking regimes: continuous at low-speed (25 rpm), continuous at high-speed (150 rpm) and an intermittent regime comprised of high and low-speed shaking intervals. The continuous, high-speed shaking produced the highest conversion yields, whereas the intermittent and low-speed shaking regimes resulted in lower conversions. After 72 h, at all shaking regimes (150 rpm, 25 rpm and <b>intermittent),</b> <b>using</b> a low substrate concentration (2. 5 %) produced conversion yields (82, 79 and 80 %) higher than those obtained at high (7. 5 %) substrate concentration (68, 63 and 68 %). As the substrate concentration increased, the conversion yields at intermittent shaking gradually approached those resulting from high-speed shaking. Thus, it appears that intermittent shaking could be a beneficial process option as it can reduce the mixing energy requirements while producing reasonably high conversion yields.
