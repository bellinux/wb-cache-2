According to Kasper, attendance reached between 180,000 and 200,000 in the 12 days of competition. The lack of snowfall concerns prior to the championships were more than made up for with continuous snowfall though that affected spectators and competitors alike.

Kasper also state the success of the women's ski jumping event will hopefully push the International Olympic Committee to include the event for the 2014 Games in Sochi with a possible team event as well.

Finally, Kasper wished everyone the best and looked <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>seeing</b> everyone at Oslo for the next Nordic World Ski Championships.|$|E

5|$|Many {{actors were}} {{considered}} to replace Reeves including: Simon Baker Denny, Jon Bon Jovi, Patrick Muldoon, Johnathon Schaech, Christian Slater, and Billy Zane. Bullock initially suggested Matthew McConaughey, who passed on the role, prompting her to suggest Jason Patric, {{with whom she had}} wanted to work since seeing his performance in After Dark, My Sweet (1990). De Bont was skeptical of featuring a relatively unknown actor such as Patric, but was reminded by the studio that Bullock and Reeves were also relatively unknown prior to Speed, and ultimately chose Patric based on his role in Sleepers (1996). Patric was paid a reported $4.5–$8 million for his role in Speed2 and used his salary to finance a 1998 drama, Your Friends & Neighbors. After accepting the role, Patric stated that he never saw Speed or had any intentions of seeing it; Reeves said he was looking <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>seeing</b> Patric star in the sequel. After Reeves declined to appear in Speed2, the screenplay was rewritten to remove his character from the story, which De Bont wanted to deal with early in the film. His absence is explained in the first scene, where Annie talks about how her relationship with Jack did not work out, and mentions her current relationship with Alex (Patric), before his character is introduced in the film.|$|E

Sepinwall particularly praised the twist of Michael quitting and said he looked <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>seeing</b> where the subplot went. Jeff Labrecque said [...] "watching Jim flail for approval [...] one of the episode's most awkward delights", but he said the episode was really about [...] "the type of man Michael Scott really is". Labrecque also said he looked <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>seeing</b> how Michael regained his job, and raised the suggestion that the reason Michael clashed so much with Charles was because he was intimidated by the man's race. Brian Howard of The Journal News said, [...] "For 22 minutes of not much fun and only some funny, 'New Boss' was a pretty good episode." [...] He particularly liked the ending, which {{he said he did not}} see coming and served as a kind of redemption for Michael; Howard also liked Pam's documentary interviews and Jim's failed efforts to make a good impression to Charles.
