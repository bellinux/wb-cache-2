The fields are mostly generated by internal plasma currents, {{plasma confinement}} is toroidal, and the compact torus exhibits resiliency {{and stability in}} virtue of the ``rugged`` helicity invariant. Based on these considerations we are developing a coaxial rail-gun type Compact Torus Accelerator (CTA). In the CTA, the CT ring is formed between coaxial electrodes using a magnetized Marshall gun, it is quasistatically ``precompressed`` in a conical <b>electrode</b> <b>section</b> for inductive energy storage, it is accelerated in a straight-coaxial <b>electrode</b> <b>section</b> as in a conventional rail-gun, and it is focused to small size and high energy and power density in a final ``focus`` cone section.

40|$|This work {{presents}} a modification approach and first measurements of commercial cylindrical Li-ion cells with multiple local potential probes and an internal temperature sensor. Local potential measurements at low currents show a non-uniform potential distribution along the electrode, {{dominated by the}} open circuit voltage (OCV) of the negative electrode. For higher currents, the overpotential along the current collector becomes dominant and instead of a corrugated potential distribution, a significant current dependent voltage gradient can be detected, indicating a highly non-uniform state of charge (SOC) distribution with increasing distance to the current collecting tab. After the discharge operation, a quick potential equalization can be witnessed which results in a non-detectable potential difference between the single <b>electrode</b> <b>sections</b> after 12 min, even though the overall cell voltage relaxation has not reached an equilibrium state yet. The presented modification approach combines the advantages of high quality industrial manufactured cells showing uniform coating thicknesses and packing density with the advantages of special tailor made cells for in situ measurements.

40|$|The {{subject of}} the present work is the {{numerical}} verification and experimental validation of the FEM model which would enable us to analyse the vibrations of collecting electrodes.

40|$|This article {{concerns}} the investigation results of {{influence of the}} amplitude-modulated acting signal parameters on the thermoelectric characteristics of biological tissues for a specified geometry of the working <b>electrode</b> <b>section</b> during RF mono-polar electrocoagulation. The geometric model ‘electrode - a biological tissue’ was suggested to study the distribution of power and temperature fields in biological tissue during mono-polar coagulation. The model of biological tissue is represented as a cylinder and the needle electrode is an ellipsoid immersed in the biological tissue. The heat and quasi-electrostatics equations are used as a mathematical model. These equations are solved in Comsol Multiphysics environment. As a result, we have got the following findings: the technique of calculating parameters of the PAM acting signal which has a fixed carrier frequency for the needle electrode of a specified geometry and the immersion depth in biological tissues is suggested. Parameters of PAM signal are determined for this electrode geometry. These parameters provide a 60 [...] . 80 °C heating range of biological tissues near the working part of the tool for different amplitudes of acting signal during RF coagulation. It has been found out that both the temperature and the relaxation frequency of biological tissue depend on exposure time for the needle electrode of a specified geometry and immersion depth of the working part of tool into biological tissue. It is shown that the relaxation frequency of the biological tissue, subjected to the radiofrequency pulses, linearly depends on its heating temperature {{and can be used}} as a numerical criterion for maintaining the specified temperature conditions.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Chemical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. Applications of {{chromium}} {{vary widely}} (refractories, chemicals and metallurgical); however, the greatest benefit of chromium {{is its ability}} to improve the corrosion resistance, strength and hardness of steel. South Africa possesses approximately 75 % of the viable global chromite reserves and, as a result, dominates the ferrochrome market with production in excess of 5 million mega tonnes per year - making it an industry of extreme importance to the South African economy Submerged arc ferroalloy production furnaces mainly use Soderberg electrodes - self–baking continuous electrodes that are produced in situ during furnace operation. Electrode breakings may affect a furnace {{in a number of ways}} depending on the nature and location of the break. Low furnace power input, abnormal charging and tapping conditions, as well as loss of production are among the more common negative implications associated with electrode breaks. The successful operation of Soderberg electrodes is dependent on two main factors: high quality electrode paste and effective electrode management procedures. This study focused on electrode paste quality. The raw materials utilised in the production of Soderberg electrode paste consists of calcined anthracite mixed with a tar pitch binder. In this study the focus was on the development of an experimental procedure to measure the dimensional changes of electrode paste raw materials as a function of temperature by means of thermomechanical analysis (TMA). Three uncalcined anthracite (Zululand chips, Zululand duff, and Tendele duff) and two tar pitch samples (low and high softening point pitches, i. e. LSP and HSP) were obtained from a local paste producer. Electrode graphite samples were also obtained from a local pre–baked electrode supplier. The experimental procedure for both the anthracite and tar pitches consisted of two phases: sample preparation and TMA measurements. During the sample preparation procedure for the tar pitches, the two tar pitches were heat treated in order to prevent softening in the TMA (preventing possibly damage the instrument), where after pellets were pressed for TMA measurement. The anthracite samples were calcined at 1200, 1300 and 1400 °C in the anthracite sample preparation phase. TMA sample pellets of calcined and uncalcined anthracite were pressed using only water as a binder. TMA was performed on pellets produced from the heat–treated tar pitch samples, uncalcined and calcined anthracite samples, as well as core drilled pellets of the pre–baked electrode graphite. The dimensional changes of these pellets were measured, as a function of temperature, through three consecutive heating (room temperature to 1300 °C) and cooling (1300 °C to approximately 100 °C) cycles under a N 2 atmosphere. A significant shrinkage (> 12 %) for both the LSP and HSP tar pitches occurred during the first TMA heating cycle. During the second and third heating cycles of the LSP and HSP tar pitches, dimensional changes were approximately 2 %. This indicates that substantial structural reordering of the carbonaceous binder takes place during the first heating cycle. TMA results obtained for all three the calcined anthracite samples investigated indicated thermal dimensional changes of less than 1 %. The anthracite samples calcined at the highest experimental calcination temperature (1400 °C) prior to TMA analysis had the smallest dimensional changes. This confirmed that higher calcination temperatures result in a higher level of structural ordering and dimensional stability. Considering the combined calcined anthracite and tar pitches TMA results, the importance of the initial baking of a Soderberg electrode at temperatures exceeding the baking isotherm temperature (475 °C) becomes apparent - the dimensional behaviour of the tar pitch binder and the calcined anthracite differ dramatically, making the newly–formed electrode very susceptible to breakage. Once structural reordering of the pitch had taken place, thermal dimensional behaviours of the materials are much more similar, significantly reducing the risk of thermal shock–induced electrode breakages. In contrast to the relatively small dimensional changes measured for the calcined anthracite samples, the shrinkages measured for the uncalcined samples during the first TMA heating/cooling cycle were substantial (6 – 8 %). This indicates the importance of the anthracite calcination process, before the electrode paste is formulated. Improperly calcined anthracite present in electrode paste would result in additional dimensional shrinkage that would have to be accommodated in the baking of a new <b>electrode</b> <b>section.</b> Considering the large shrinkage of the tar pitch that already takes place, it is unlikely that a strong enough electrode would be formed if this occurs. From the results, it also became apparent that the anthracite with the highest fixed carbon and lowest ash contents exhibited the smallest shrinkage during in situ TMA calcination. High fixed carbon, low ash type anthracites are therefore less prone to dimensional instabilities in Soderberg electrodes, as a result of poor calcination. The dimensional changes observed in the calcined anthracites were very similar to those observed for the electrode graphite samples. The expansions/shrinkages observed in the graphite samples were mostly less than 0. 5 %, whereas the expansions/shrinkages observed in the various calcined anthracites were approximately 0. 6 to 0. 9 %. The difference in the magnitude of the dimensional behaviour between the calcined anthracites and the graphite can be attributed to the fact that the graphite had already undergone maximum structural ordering (having been pre–baked at 3000 °C).

The concept {{is based on}} the capillary suspension phenomenon: graphite and conductive agent are dispersed in an aqueous binder solution and the organic solvent octanol is added as immiscible, secondary fluid providing the formation of a sample-spanning network resulting in unique stability and coating properties. No additional processing steps compared to conventional slurry preparation are required. The resulting ultra-thick electrodes comprise mass loadings of about 16. 5 mg cm− 2, uniform layer thickness, and superior edge contours. The adjustment of mechanical energy input ensures uniform distribution of the conductive agent and sufficient electronic conductivity of the final dry composite electrode.

40|$|We use Monte Carlo {{simulations}} {{to examine}} the simplest model of an ionic liquid, called the restricted primitive model, at a metal surface. We find that at moderately low temperatures the capacitance of the metal/ionic liquid interface is so large that the effective thickness of the electrostatic double-layer is up to 3 times smaller than the ion radius. To interpret these results we suggest an approach {{which is based on}} the interaction between discrete ions and their image charges in the metal surface and which therefore goes beyond the mean-field approximation. When a voltage is applied across the interface, the strong image attraction causes counterions to condense onto the metal surface to form compact ion-image dipoles. These dipoles repel each other to form a correlated liquid. When the surface density of these dipoles is low, the insertion of an additional dipole does not require much energy. This leads to a large capacitance $C$ that decreases monotonically with voltage $V$, producing a "bell-shaped" curve $C(V) $. We also consider what happens when the electrode is made from a semi-metal rather than a perfect metal. In this case, the finite screening radius of the electrode shifts the reflection plane for image charges to the interior of the electrode and we arrive at a "camel-shaped" $C(V) $. These predictions seem to be in qualitative agreement with experiment.

However, the translation of DMFCs into commercially successful products is precluded due to poor performance. In addition, low activity, poor durability and reliability and an expensive anode and cathode further discourage the application of DMFCs. In this regard, the present review article focuses on recent progress in the development of anode and cathode catalysts for DMFCs. The first part of the review discusses the recent developments in the synthesis of single-, double-, and multiple-component catalysts and new catalyst supports for anode <b>electrodes.</b> The <b>section</b> is followed by the chemical approaches employed to make alloys and composite catalysts, aiming to enhance their activity, reliability and durability for the methanol oxidation reaction. Finally, exciting new research that pushes the development of single-, double-, and multiple-component catalysts and new catalyst supports for cathode electrodes is introduced. In addition, size-, shape- and composition-dependent electrocatalysts that are advocated for methanol oxidation at the anode and oxygen reduction at the cathode are highlighted to illustrate the potential of the newly developed electrocatalysts for DMFC applications. Moreover, this article provides a comprehensive review of the experimental work that is devoted to understanding the fundamental problems and recent progress in the development of anode and cathode catalysts for DMFCs. close 251...|$|R
40|$|This report {{documents}} {{an investigation}} of irreversible electrical breakdown in ZnO varistors due to short pulses of high electric field and current density. For those varistors that suffer breakdown, there is a monotonic, pulse-by-pulse degradation in the switching electric field. The electrical and structural characteristics of varistors during and after breakdown are described qualitatively and quantitatively. Once breakdown is nucleated, the degradation typically follows a well-defined relationship {{between the number of}} post-initiation pulses and the degraded switching voltage. In some cases the degraded varistor has a remnant 20 {micro}m diameter hollow track showing strong evidence of once-molten ZnO. A model is developed for both electrical and thermal effects during high energy pulsing. The breakdown is assumed to start at one electrode and advance towards the other electrode as a thin filament of conductive material that grows incrementally with each successive pulse. The model is partially validated by experiments in which the varistor rod is cut at several different lengths from the <b>electrode.</b> Invariably one <b>section</b> of the cut varistor has a switching field that is not degraded while the other section(s) are heavily degraded. Based on the experiments and models of behavior during breakdown, some speculations {{about the nature of the}} nucleating mechanism are offered in the last section...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} oxygen {{depletion}} along the cathode flow channels {{on the local}} impedance response of a polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) operated on air and pure hydrogen was investigated using a novel experimental approach. The method combines the use of <b>sectioned</b> <b>electrodes</b> and local ac measurements in PEFCs. The results shown here give experimental proof that oxygen concentration oscillations in the cathode gas channels generated {{as a consequence of}} ac current flow evoke the formation of a low frequency capacitive loop in local H- 2 /air-PEFC impedance spectra in downstream parts of the flow field. The loop shows positive or negative real parts at low frequencies depending on the air stoichiometry. The loop is not observed in the local spectrum when the ac current is applied locally and, consequently, the impact of upstream processes on the local impedance response is excluded. A mechanistic description of the processes occurring during ac measurements in H- 2 /air-PEFCs was developed and validated by experiments. The results show that processes occurring along the flow channels of a PEFC cannot be excluded from the interpretation of PEFC impedance spectra even at rather high air stoichiometries and are in fact the most important phenomena at low modulation frequencies (f(mod) < 10 Hz) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{conducting}} {{and mechanical}} properties of a metallic nanowire formed {{at the junction}} between two macroscopic metallic electrodes are investigated. Both two- and three-dimensional wires with a W(ide) -N(arrow) -W(ide) geometry are modelled in the free-electron approximation with hard-wall boundary conditions. Tunneling and quantum-size effects are treated exactly using the scattering matrix formalism. Oscillations of order E_F/lambda_F in the tensile force are found when the wire is stretched to the breaking point, which are synchronized with quantized jumps in the conductance. The force and conductance are shown to be essentially independent of {{the width of the}} wide <b>sections</b> (<b>electrodes).</b> The exact results are compared with an adiabatic approximation; the later is found to overestimate the effects of tunneling, but still gives qualitatively reasonable results for nanowires of length L>>lambda_F, even for this abrupt geometry. In addition to the force and conductance, the net charge of the nanowire is calculated and the effects of screening are included within linear response theory. Mesoscopic charge fluctuations of order e are predicted which are strongly correlated with the mesoscopic force fluctuations. The local density of states at the Fermi energy exhibits nontrivial behavior which is correlated with fine structure in the force and conductance, showing the importance of treating the whole wire as a mesoscopic system rather than treating only the narrow part.
