5|$|A. Keene Richard was {{the first}} American known to have {{specifically}} bred Arabian horses. He traveled to the desert in 1853 and 1856 to obtain breeding stock, which <b>he</b> <b>crossed</b> on Thoroughbreds, and also bred purebred Arabians. Unfortunately, his horses were lost during the Civil War and have no known purebred Arabian descendants today. Another major U.S. political figure, William H. Seward purchased four Arabians in Beirut in 1859, prior to becoming Secretary of State to Abraham Lincoln.|$|E
5|$|After qualifying, {{the race}} {{stewards}} {{decided not to}} give a penalty to Magnussen for crossing the pit light, since it had only changed to red 0.55 seconds before <b>he</b> <b>crossed</b> the pit exit line. Kvyat escaped penalty as well after his car failed the obligatory front floor deflection test. As the team pointed out, the irregularity {{was the result of}} an impact on track, allowing him to keep eighth on the grid.|$|E

5|$|VThe king of Spain (of the time) {{commissioned}} Jacques-Louis David's Napoleon Crossing the Alps as {{a friendly}} gesture towards Napoleon, {{hoping that the}} flattering gift would strengthen relationships between France and Spain, {{to the degree that}} Napoleon would not consider invading Spain and taking it over, after he became emperor. However, the king of Spain's attempt failed, and, soon after Napoleon crowned himself emperor, <b>he</b> <b>crossed</b> the Pyrenees and conquered Spain.|$|E
5|$|When he had recovered, he {{sailed to}} the front, but was shipwrecked; after coming ashore {{with a handful}} of companions, <b>he</b> <b>crossed</b> hostile {{territory}} to Caesar's camp, which impressed his great-uncle considerably.

When back in Rome, Caesar deposited a new will with the Vestal Virgins, naming Octavius as the prime beneficiary.|$|E
5|$|When the {{two sides}} met in late-February, {{a week before the}} brawl game, during the third period, Flyers winger Mark Recchi was {{following}} Martin Havlat of the Senators when <b>he</b> <b>crossed</b> into the Philadelphia defensive zone. As this happened, Recchi hooked Havlat, causing both of the players to collide and fall into the boards. When Havlat got up from the ice, angered by Recchi's hook, he took his stick above him and slashed Recchi, hitting him in the face.|$|E

5|$|A similar {{play in the}} game's {{second half}} scored another {{touchdown}}. Quarterback Doc Kuhn dropped back for a more than 40-yard touchdown pass to Bomar. The pass went 28 yards in the air, with Bomar running {{the rest of the}} way. Georgia running back Dave Collings tackled him as <b>he</b> <b>crossed</b> the goal line (injuring himself), and Bomar also made an interception in the 12–0 Vanderbilt victory. The season's final game, against Vanderbilt's oldest rival Sewanee, had a trick play by the Commodores. A fake run ended with Kuhn tossing the ball to Bomar, who was left open behind the defense and easily ran it in; Vanderbilt won, 26–0.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the writer}} Branko Ćopić, who was a Partisan in Grmeč, Stojanović was greeted by a crowd of villagers and welcomed with the {{traditional}} bread and salt ceremony when <b>he</b> <b>crossed</b> the Sana River. Prominent villagers shook hands with him, and they compared him with Miloš Obilića famous Serbian epic hero from the medieval Battle of Kosovo. Several women approached Stojanović to kiss his hands; he declined this mark of respect, {{saying that he was}} not a priest but a communist.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{traveled}} {{along the}} southeastern {{banks of the}} Richelieu River, up to Sorel, where <b>he</b> <b>crossed</b> that river and continued up the southern shore of the St. Lawrence to Longueuil. According to Allen's account, he met Brown there, {{and the two of}} them then hatched a plan to attack Montreal. Brown would cross the river with 200 men at La Prairie, upriver from Montreal, and Allen, with his Americans and 80 Canadians under the command of Loiseau and Duggan, two of Livingston's captains, would cross the river at Longueuil, below the city, and the two forces would, after a prearranged signal, converge on the city itself.|$|E

5|$|As {{he began}} the third orbit, Schirra {{disconnected}} the spacecraft's gyroscopes, turned off part of the electrical power system, and let the capsule drift. He took advantage of this quiet period to test his spatial awareness and motor control, which he found was broadly unaffected by weightlessness, and to eat a light meal. He powered the spacecraft back up over the Indian Ocean, and continued over the Pacific. At Hawaii, he was given clearance for a full six-orbit mission, and as <b>he</b> <b>crossed</b> over towards California shut down the electrical power for a second period of drifting flight, during which he occupied himself taking photographs with the onboard camera.|$|E

General Theodor von Rüdiger's corps (12,000 men and 42 guns) crossed the Upper Vistula at Józefów on 7 August and captured Radom.|$|E
5|$|By 1948, Rothenberg's {{father had}} died and his mother, Lotte (1894–1990), had become a {{naturalized}} United States citizen. To be with her in New York City, Rothenberg journeyed to Canada, arriving in Halifax, Nova Scotia; traveling from there to Toronto, he lived for a while at Wycliffe College, where he worked briefly as a construction laborer. On 19 November 1948, <b>he</b> <b>crossed</b> the international border into the United States at Buffalo, with $12.00 in his pocket. In 1951, he volunteered for the United States Army, transferred to the Air Force, and served in the Korean War until 1955.

5|$|Five days later, {{teammate}} {{and close}} friend Vasil Kiryienka rode {{to victory in}} a solo effort, and he too dedicated the stage victory to Tondó, pointing skyward as <b>he</b> <b>crossed</b> the finish line. The team had met to consider withdrawing from the race after Tondó's death, but instead the riders unanimously voted to ride on. Kiryienka commented that the squad at the Giro hoped to get a further stage win (as Francisco Ventoso's win had come before Tondó's death) to honor him, while {{other members of the}} team grieved with Tondó's family. In {{the final days of the}} race, many fans wrote signs memorializing Tondó as they had with Weylandt earlier on.|$|E
5|$|Fox {{ran with}} an unusual gait, as he was {{required}} to hop-step on his good leg due to the extra time the springs in his artificial leg required to reset after each step. He found the training painful as the additional pressure he had to place on both his good leg and his stump led to bone bruises, blisters and intense pain. Fox found that after about 20minutes of each run, <b>he</b> <b>crossed</b> a pain threshold and the run became easier.|$|E
