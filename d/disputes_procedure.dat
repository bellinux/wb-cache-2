40|$|Many claim {{a process}} of judicialization of {{international}} <b>dispute</b> settlement <b>procedures</b> is taking place. In order to capture this ongoing process we introduce an analytical framework to assess the degree of judicialization of international <b>dispute</b> settlement <b>procedures.</b> We then proceed to present preliminary results of applying this framework to the procedure and practice of dispute settlement in the United Nations Security Council. In our concept, judicialization means that international <b>dispute</b> settlement <b>procedures</b> increasingly incorporate the normative principle of impartiality, i. e. the principle of a comparable treatment of comparable breaches of law. We use a graded scale ranging from purely diplomatic to predominantly judicial procedures to assess the degree of judicialization of any given <b>dispute</b> settlement <b>procedure.</b> From our institutionalist point of view, it is entirely an empirical question whether – and if so when – judicialized <b>dispute</b> settlement <b>procedures</b> lead to a corresponding practice of judicialized dispute settlement. For this reason we analyze in a second step the corresponding practice of dispute settlement. The degree of judicialization of the <b>dispute</b> settlement <b>procedure</b> {{within the framework of}} the United Nations Security Council remains low. Nonetheless, our comparison of the periods 1974 - 1983 and 1990 - 1999 suggests so far an increasing judicialization of the dispute settlement practice within the Security Council. ...|$|R

40|$|The current New Zealand tax <b>disputes</b> {{resolution}} <b>procedures</b> were {{enacted in}} 1996 following a recommendation {{made by the}} Organisational Review Committee of the Inland Revenue Department in 1994. Yet, following their enactment and despite a number of positive aspects to the <b>disputes</b> resolution <b>procedures,</b> commentators and professional bodies alike have continued to raise concerns that inefficiencies, {{particularly with respect to}} time and cost, are affecting their operation and are, consequently, adversely impacting on taxpayers’ perceptions of the fairness of the procedures. It is believed that this is potentially negatively impacting on the tax system and on taxpayer voluntary compliance. Consequently, suggestions have been made for the use of alternative <b>disputes</b> resolution <b>procedures,</b> such as mediation, as another method to resolve tax disputes. The objective {{of this study is to}} develop a refined tax mediation regime for New Zealand through improving the features of the proposed tax mediation regime for New Zealand’s tax disputes resolution system first developed by Jone and Maples (2012 b). Utilising a sequential mixed methods approach, consisting of a quantitative survey questionnaire followed by a qualitative focus group interview, this study seeks feedback on Jone and Maples’ (2012 b) proposed New Zealand tax mediation regime from purposively selected practitioners (experts) in the tax disputes resolution and mediation fields. The feedback obtained is used in refining Jone and Maples’ (2012 b) proposed tax mediation regime. This study finds that the most important aspect of the refined proposed regime is the inclusion of a mediator who is independent of both parties and moreover, that the mediator is foremost trained and qualified in mediation as opposed to being a specialist in tax law. The findings also indicate that mediation should not be made a mandatory phase of the <b>disputes</b> <b>procedures.</b> This study recommends that the refined tax mediation regime should be an administrative phase and incorporated with the existing conference phase in a proposed ‘ADR stage’ of the <b>disputes</b> <b>procedures.</b> Notwithstanding the potential budgetary and resource constraints, the findings indicate that if mediation were to be provided as a cost-free service, taxpayers (particularly small taxpayers) should be appreciative of the opportunity to put their cases forward and be heard, even if an agreement has not been reached through mediation. The literature suggests that this should in turn enhance taxpayers’ perceptions of fairness of the <b>disputes</b> <b>procedures</b> and thereby voluntary compliance. This study provides a foundation for the further development of tax mediation in New Zealand...|$|R
40|$|Analysing {{disputes}} between the US and the EU under GATT and the WTO respectively, the paper {{demonstrates that the}} judicialization (or legalization) of international <b>dispute</b> settlement <b>procedures</b> can contribute to states’ compliance with these dispute settlement mechanisms. The paper compares four sets of pairwise similar disputes with US had with the EU: the socalled Domestic International Sales Corporations (DISC) case (which arose under GATT) and the Foreign Sales Corporations case (which was settled through WTO procedures), the Steel case (GATT) and the Patents case (WTO), the two Hormones cases under GATT and the WTO respectively, and the Citrus case (GATT) and the Bananas case (WTO). In {{each of the four}} comparisons the US acted more in accordance with the judicial WTO <b>dispute</b> settlement <b>procedures</b> than with the diplomatic GATT procedures. We can therefore say that contrary to realist assumptions, the judicialization of <b>dispute</b> settlement <b>procedures</b> can contribute to their effectiveness. However, contrary to idealist assumptions the effectiveness of international <b>dispute</b> settlement <b>procedures</b> does not automatically follow from their judicialization. Yet, as assumed by institutionalists, judicialized <b>dispute</b> settlement <b>procedures</b> are better than diplomatic dispute settlement mechanisms in sustaining states’ compliance with these procedures precisely because of their normative and strategic effects...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} limits of {{international}} trade cooperation {{in the presence of}} a <b>dispute</b> settlement <b>procedure.</b> The <b>dispute</b> settlement <b>procedure</b> is modeled as set of conditions imposed on the punishment equilibria of a repeated tariff game, conditions that are consistent with the WTO principles of conciliation and reciprocity. The resulting equilibria are "renegotiation-proof" in the sense of Pearce (1987). We find that tariff agreements cannot achieve free trade in the presence of the <b>dispute</b> settlement <b>procedure,</b> although the cost of this limitation becomes small for high discount factors. Quota agreements can achieve free trade under the dispute settlement procedure; however, countries would always prefer to settle disputes with tariff sanctions, if given a choice. These results are related to recent dispute settlement reforms...|$|R

40|$|Just as oranges are not {{the only}} fruit, strikes {{are not the}} only type of {{industrial}} dispute. This thesis examines two other forms of bargaining breakdown: <b>dispute</b> <b>procedure</b> usage; and action short of a strike - particularly overtime bans. It therefore covers two distinctive phenomena but some of the issues examined are relevant to both forms of disputes, whilst others are specific to one particular type. Complementary issues include the evaluation of economists' theories of bargaining impasses and the relevance of both areas to the 'new industrial relations' debate. Both parts also shed light on the important conceptual implications of applying the body of largely North American theory to the UK context. Chapter 1 illuminates the linkages between the two areas at greater length, provides important definitions, explains the data used and summarises the six substantive chapters. Chapters 2 to 5 examine final-offer arbitration (FOA) in the context of Britain's new style agreements on criteria connected to five issues: the incidence of <b>dispute</b> <b>procedures</b> and their specifications; the core question of effectiveness in terms of deterring disputes; the incidence of industrial action under particular dispute procedures; the impact of procedures on negotiated and arbitrated settlements; and the functioning of <b>dispute</b> <b>procedures</b> in action. These chapters suggest that although the evidence is mixed, there is no convincing support for the superior effectiveness of FOA over conventional arbitration or other impasse procedures. The almost totally unresearched area of action short of a strike is examined in chapters 6 and 7. The relative incidence of strikes and non-strike action is assessed using data from various UK surveys over the period 1966 - 1990 and principally with newly available data source - the CBI Pay Databank. Data from this source are also used to test possible explanatory factors behind the tactics of industrial action...|$|R

40|$|The author investigates factors {{influencing}} {{the adoption of}} <b>dispute</b> resolu-tion <b>procedures</b> in the nonunion workplace. Various explanations are tested using data from a 1998 survey of <b>dispute</b> resolution <b>procedures</b> in the telecom-munications industry. The results suggest that both institutional pressures and human resource strategies are factors driving the adoption of nonunion proce-dures. Among institutional factors, rising individual employment rights litiga-tion and expanded court deferral to nonunion arbitration have led to increased adoption of mandatory arbitration procedures in the nonunion workplace. At the same time, an older institutional factor-union substitution by nonunion employers aimed at avoiding union organizing-continues to inspire the adop-tion of nonunion <b>dispute</b> resolution <b>procedures,</b> especially peer review. Finally, the results provide some support for {{a link between the}} use of high performance work systems and the adoption of nonunion <b>dispute</b> resolution <b>procedures.</b> Conflict is an inherent part of the em-ployment relationship.

40|$|Excerpt] This paper {{investigates the}} adoption, structure, and {{function}} of <b>dispute</b> resolution <b>procedures</b> in the nonunion workplace. Whereas grievance procedures in unionized workplaces have been an important area of study {{in the field of}} industrial relations, research on <b>dispute</b> resolution <b>procedures</b> in nonunion workplaces has lagged behind. As a result, our knowledge of the development of nonunion procedures remains relatively limited. Similarly, with a few noteworthy exceptions (e. g. Lewin, 1987, 1990), our knowledge of workplace grievance activity is almost entirely based on research conducted in unionized settings. Given the major differences in the institutional contexts of union and nonunion workplaces in the United States, existing ideas about workplace dispute resolution developed in the unionized setting will likely require significant modification in order to understand <b>dispute</b> resolution <b>procedures</b> and activity in the nonunion workplace. Issues relating to dispute resolution in the nonunion workplace are of increasing importance to public policy given the combination of continued stagnation in levels of union representation and mounting concerns over rising levels of employment litigation in the courts. Knowing what nonunion <b>dispute</b> resolution <b>procedures</b> look like and how they function will help answer the question of what role these procedures may play in the future governance of the workplace...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the resolution of}} conflict in non-union workplaces. Employee participation in workplace decision making and organizational <b>dispute</b> resolution <b>procedures</b> are two factors hypothesized to influence the outcomes of conflicts in the non-union workplace. The adoption of high involvement work systems is found to produce an organizational context in which both triggering events for conflict, such as disciplinary and dismissal decisions, and dispute resolution activities, such as grievance filing and appeals, are reduced in frequency. <b>Dispute</b> resolution <b>procedures</b> have mixed impacts. Greater due process protections in <b>dispute</b> resolution <b>procedures</b> in non-union workplaces are associated with increased grievance filing and higher appeal rates but do not have significant impacts on the precursors to conflict. This study provides evidence of substantial organizational level variation in non-union conflict resolution, suggesting the importance of expanding the predominant individual and group-level focus of current conflict management research to include more organizational-level factors. It also supports the importance to non-union employee representation of direct participation strategies involving employee involvement in the workplace, in addition to procedures that provide for off-line representation...|$|R
