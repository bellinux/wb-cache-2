Kellow's next patent, obtained in 1906, included recycling of the water, which was fed through a 3 in inner flexible pipe, running through the middle of a 5 in outer pipe, through which the spent water was returned to the sump from which the drill was supplied. Despite the complexity of the hose, the unions which held lengths together were watertight under [...] The new design was also much quieter than the old. Next he redesigned the bit, which used a replaceable D-shaped cutter, making it much easier to manufacture than a twist-bit, and this was covered by a patent obtained in 1910. Some water was fed through the drill to lubricate and cool the cutting surfaces. Two further patents from 1914 covered an improved gearbox and a redesigned two-stage reaction turbine, and another in 1915 covered an improved <b>feed</b> <b>cylinder.</b> This supplied the forward thrust to the drill bit, typically 2 to 3 tons for drilling slate, although trials on granite had used up to 20 tons.

50|$|The use of straight-five petrol {{engines in}} mass {{production}} cars only became truly viable {{with the advent}} of reliable fuel injection. A five-cylinder engine using a carburetor fuel system has an unavoidable problem in that the length of the inlet manifold between the carburetor varies too greatly between cylinders at the ends of the engine and those nearer the carburetor for reliable and consistent fuel delivery. Using multiple carburetors (two or three) always results in one carburetor <b>feeding</b> more <b>cylinders</b> than the other, which also produces running and tuning problems. In theory individual carburetors could be used for each cylinder, but this approach is expensive and still brings with it the attendant difficulties in balancing the multiple carbs. Multi-point fuel injection circumvents all the above problems by <b>feeding</b> each <b>cylinder</b> individually from a central, single pump. This fueling issue was never present in diesel engines (except the Volvo D5) which used fuel injection from the very start, which is why large five-cylinder diesels were commonly seen decades before the type's adoption for automotive use.|$|R

A self-propelled harvesting platform, equipped with a small Otto engine was chosen to study mechanical solutions to adapt the chosen machine to L. P.

50|$|Where the D.II {{differed}} from the Austro-Daimler was largely in mechanical arrangement.

Another unique feature was the ability to shift the camshaft to a half-compression position for starting. The D.II used two carburetors located together on one side of the engine, <b>feeding</b> the <b>cylinders</b> through two manifolds; the Austro-Daimler separated its carburetors to locate them closer to the cylinders they fed.

40|$|Development {{efforts are}} in {{progress}} to enhance safeguards implementation at uranium enrichment facilities. One {{component of the}} enhanced approach is the systematic tracking of UF 6 cylinders between process and storage areas {{as well as between}} different process areas. The main challenges are the means of tracking the cylinders reliably with a minimum of operator involvement, and finding the optimum location to install a monitoring system which is capable of recognising all types of cylinders as well detecting non-standard containers. A Laser Item Identification System (L 2 IS) has been developed successfully that is capable of monitoring all transfers of UF 6 cylinders between process areas. L 2 IS uniquely identifies each cylinder through exploring the unique microstructure of each cylinder's surface. It has been demonstrated that every cylinder has a unique 'fingerprint' which remains intact even under extreme environmental conditions. The L 2 IS system is composed of a portable unit, operated in attended mode, and a fixed installed unit, operated without inspector presence. The portable unit acquires the fingerprints of a given set of <b>feed</b> <b>cylinders</b> intended to be used over the coming months and the fixed system monitors the flow of previously identified cylinders in a transfer corridor. This system is coupled with standard video surveillance that can remotely transmit state of health information to IAEA Headquarters. The video surveillance can be interfaced with electronic seals applied to the cylinders to record and display seals data (e. g. status, time/date of application). The integration of data from the L 2 IS with data from weighing and NDA stations is foreseen to monitor and verify all transfers. This will provide a high deterrence of diversion or substitution, and an increased probability of detection thereof. The paper will describe the successful results of the L 2 IS after a year of field testing, the intended use of the L 2 IS during inspection, and the possible additional integration of other monitoring capabilities.

At idle and up to about one-third load only the smaller tube of each set is mechanically operated by the accelerator pedal, while the second tube of each set is enabled by a vacuum cell only at high load and high engine speed. All four (2 x 2) tubes are supplied with fuel by a central float chamber. The engine is equipped with gasoline feed line and gasoline return line (which usually was more typical for fuel injection engines) achieving a cooling effect which protects from vapor locks, that would cause starting problems in hot weather.|$|R
5000|$|The {{single-acting}} uniflow {{steam engine}} configuration closely {{resembles that of}} a two-stroke internal combustion engine, {{and it is possible}} to convert a two-stroke engine to a uniflow steam engine by <b>feeding</b> the <b>cylinder</b> with steam via a [...] "bash valve" [...] fitted in place of the spark plug. As the rising piston nears the top of its stroke, it knocks open the bash valve to admit a pulse of steam. The valve closes automatically as the piston descends, and the steam is exhausted through the existing cylinder porting. The inertia of the flywheel then carries the piston back to the top of its stroke against the compression, as it does in the original form of the engine. Also like the original, the conversion is not self-starting and must be turned over by an external power source to start. An example of such a conversion is the steam-powered moped, which is started by pedalling.|$|R
40|$|A power {{requirement}} model was simulated at three factor interaction of process variables {{in order to}} select a combination of optimum crop and machine variables (crop moisture content, <b>feed</b> rate, <b>cylinder</b> speed) that will yield minimum grain losses for millet and sorghum threshers.

50|$|Outboard motor carburetors are {{typically}} sidedraft, because {{they must be}} stacked {{one on top of}} the other in order to <b>feed</b> the <b>cylinders</b> in a vertically oriented cylinder block.The main disadvantage of basing a carburetor's operation on Bernoulli's Principle is that, being a fluid dynamic device, the pressure reduction in a Venturi tends to be proportional to the square of the intake air speed. The fuel jets are much smaller and limited mainly by viscosity, so that the fuel flow tends to be proportional to the pressure difference. So jets sized for full power tend to starve the engine at lower speed and part throttle. Most commonly this has been corrected by using multiple jets. In SU and other movable jet carburetors, it was corrected by varying the jet size. For cold starting, a different principle was used in multi-jet carburetors. A flow resisting valve called a choke, similar to the throttle valve, was placed upstream of the main jet to reduce the intake pressure and suck additional fuel out of the jets.|$|R
25|$|An {{alternative}} to a low-pressure compressor for gas supply is high-pressure storage <b>cylinders</b> <b>feeding</b> through a pressure regulator which will be set to the required supply pressure for the depth and equipment in use. In practice HP storage {{may be used for}} either reserve gas supply or both main and reserve gas supplies to a gas panel. High-pressure bulk cylinders are quiet in operation and provide gas of known quality (if it has been tested). This allows the relatively simple and reliable use of nitrox mixtures in surface-supplied diving. Bulk cylinders are also quiet in operation compared to a low-pressure compressor, but have the obvious limitation of amount of gas available.|$|R

In the tandem compound the cylinders are arranged end to end on a common axis (in this case, vertical) with both pistons mounted on the same rod and moving together. Each cylinder has independent valves and valve gear. The pipe connecting them may be enlarged to form a 'receiver', a reservoir for steam at the intermediate pressure.
