2500|$|Busch had an [...] "up and down" [...] year in 2003, {{finishing}} eleventh in the season's points standings, earning four wins (including {{a season}} sweep at Bristol, {{making him the}} first driver to do that since Rusty Wallace accomplished the feat in 2000), nine Top 5's, and 14 Top 10 finishes but a late season slump put him in this <b>finishing</b> <b>spot</b> in the point standings, although he collected over [...] again that year. Busch was the runner-up finisher in what was the closest finish in all of NASCAR history – this was the Carolina Dodge Dealers 400, held at Darlington on March 16 of that year. The race in this old race track was decided with a two-lap side-by-side battle between him and Ricky Craven. For two laps, the two drivers fought for the victory and touched the cars together. When the cars attached, the final lap was ferociously fought ending up with Craven shifting ahead of Busch by 0.002 of a second, making it the closest finish in NASCAR history, tied with the 2011 Aaron's 499. Busch also won the IROC championship before winning a NASCAR championship.|$|E

50|$|At the U.S. National Championships, Powers {{was part}} of the leading duo, when he was the victim of an {{untimely}} crash that saw him drop from the race lead to his eventual <b>finishing</b> <b>spot</b> of third. Despite the disappointment, Powers rebounded to finish 16th at the World Championships in St. Wendel in January, his best-ever finish as an elite rider. Powers again finished the season ranked #1 on the USA Cycling Cyclocross Rankings and finished 15th on the season's final UCI rankings.|$|E

5000|$|At night, {{the show}} takes an epic and serious turn, with the humor dialed down, and serious {{background}} music instead of its lighthearted theme music. The final four or three contestants play separately {{on a large}} obstacle course inside the studio called the Wipeout Zone, each attempting to finish the course in the fastest time, much like the first round. Though slight variations are used in each episode, contestants wear wetsuits and they begin by either sliding down a water ramp or being launched by a giant catapult or blob into the course, swimming to the first obstacle. Obstacles have varied between episodes, but the course contains several obstacles that must be traversed {{in order to reach}} the finishing platform. Some obstacles can be skipped for a time penalty, but the last obstacle(s) has to be completed in order to reach the <b>finishing</b> <b>spot.</b> The player with the fastest time on the course is declared the [...] "champion" [...] of the episode and is awarded the show's grand prize of $50,000. The Wipeout Zone often brings competitors to the brink of exhaustion, especially when they have to swim back to a starting point to retry a failed obstacle.|$|E
50|$|Myers did {{not compete}} in the Grand National Division again until 1956. He drove Ansel Rakestraw’s No. 1 Chevrolet at the ½-mile asphalt Palm Beach Speedway in West Palm Beach, Florida. He started the event in 10th and {{finished}} in 10th. At the Daytona Beach and Road Course, Myers started 63rd of 76 cars and finished 46th failing to collect any of the purse money. At the ½-mile dirt Wilson Speedway in Wilson, North Carolina, Myers started 24th and finished 7th. At Langhorne, Myers drove the No. 15W Ford owned by Bill Stroppe. Myers started the race in 8th position, but an engine failure dropped him to 38th. Myers started 12th in the No. 1 Chevrolet in the Virginia 500 at Martinsville but a right front hub failure left him in 15th position after completing 436 of the 500 laps. Myers was back {{behind the wheel of}} Bill Stroppe’s No. 4 Mercury at Road America in what would be the only Sprint Cup race held at the Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin circuit. He started the race in 14th but a crash took him out on lap 39 and he finished 21st. The Stroppe Mercury carried the No. 76 for the Southern 500 and Myers put it in the 34th starting position. Problems with the gas tank on lap 91 put him out of the event and left him with a 61st <b>finishing</b> <b>spot.</b> Myers was optimistic for the Buddy Shuman 250 at the 4/10-mile dirt Hickory Speedway in Hickory, North Carolina after qualifying sixth, but a radiator problem on lap 105 put him out of the event and left him finishing in 19th position.|$|E

50|$|Singer Britney Spears {{gave the}} command {{to start the}} engines. Ward Burton took the lead from Sterling Marlin on lap one, but relinquished it to Marlin on lap three. After Kevin Harvick, Marlin and Michael Waltrip shared the lead from laps 10 to 26, Dale Earnhardt, Jr. took the lead on lap 27, leading 22 laps. Matt Kenseth and Todd Bodine would lead for a {{combined}} seven laps, before Earnhardt reclaimed the lead and led 33 more laps. The first caution of the race flew on lap 89, when Andy Houston crashed in turn 4. Robert Pressley took the lead on lap 90, which Earnhardt reclaimed the following lap. With 18 laps to go, cars entered pit road for final stops, but ten cars (Mike Skinner, Pressley, Sterling Marlin, Jeff Gordon, Kurt Busch, Terry Labonte, Bobby Hamilton, Kevin Harvick, John Andretti, Mark Martin, Dave Marcis, Jason Leffler) {{were involved in a}} crash in turn 4. Earnhardt would surrender the lead again to Johnny Benson, Jr., who had made a late-race gamble to pull ahead. Dale Jr had to deal with lap traffic on the restart, but the Caution flew for the final time when Jeff Gordon's oil line cut. The race restarted with six laps to go with Johnny Benson still leading. But with five laps remaining, Earnhardt took back the lead, and with drafting assistance from Waltrip, claimed the victory. Elliott Sadler, Ward Burton and Bobby Labonte finished in the top five. Tony Stewart crossed the line in sixth, but officially classified in 26th, had his <b>finishing</b> <b>spot</b> taken by Jerry Nadeau; Rusty Wallace, Jeff Burton, Brett Bodine and Mike Wallace rounded out the top ten.|$|E

The 3 D surface morphology of the finished surface was characterized by Taylor Hobson CCI lite with 20 × objective of full resolution. After finishing the experiment on a 100  mm[*]×[*] 100  mm KDP via self-developed MRF apparatus and cleaning, the surface figure accuracy was examined and analyzed by Zygo interferometer.|$|E
30|$|Magnetorheological {{finishing}} (MRF) is {{an advanced}} sub-aperture polishing technology that contains magnetic sensitive carbonyl iron powders (CIPs) and nonmagnetic abrasive incorporated in aqueous medium. The choice of abrasive {{is directed by}} the interaction with workpiece such as the physical properties (e.g., hardness) and chemical properties (e.g., chemical durability). It {{is considered to be}} an excellent, deterministic process for finishing optics to high precision with few subsurface defects [9 – 11]. For a typical MRF process, the fluid is pumped and ejected through a nozzle onto a strong magnetic rotating wheel, and the ribbon is stiffened upon passing into the vicinity of workpiece. The removal rate is determined by process parameters as well as material properties of fluid and workpiece [12 – 14]. The <b>finishing</b> <b>spot</b> in the contacting zone between ribbon and workpiece is characterized to generate removal function arithmetic.|$|E

Despite the success, the points reset by the newly formed Chase for the Cup erased Gordon's 60-point lead over Johnson. As a result, {{at the end of}} the season, he finished the season third in the points standings behind champion Kurt Busch by 16 points and Johnson by eight.
