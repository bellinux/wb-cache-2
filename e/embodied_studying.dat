40|$|One of {{the great}} merits of the {{embodied}} language paradigm is that of highlighting the fact that language understanding has to be led back to action and perception. The comprehension of an action-related sentence activates the same neural structures that enable the execution of that action. However, <b>embodied</b> language <b>studies</b> have been mostly focused on descriptive usages of language. Notions {{such as those of}} usage, context or pragmatic intrusion have not been sufficiently considered. A usage-based model of language will be here presented. <b>Embodied</b> language <b>studies</b> will be discussed in the light of this model...|$|R

40|$|The present work <b>embodies</b> <b>studies</b> on {{the problem}} of fibrin {{regeneration}} in rabbits deprived of the entire liver (1). In the past the formation of fibrinogen has been ascribed to various organs. Claude Bernard in 1848 (2), Lehmann (3), and Brown-S 6 quard (4) believed they had found the blood of the mesenteric veins rich in the substance and the content of the hepatic and renal veins relatively poor. Years later these findings seemed to be confirmed by the work of Dastre (5 - 8). As result the liver was credited with the function of fibrinogen destruction while certain other organs, particularly the intestine, were looked upon as its chief site of origin. By others, in the meantime, the lungs and skin (6), the bone marrow (9, 10), and leucocytes (11) have been thought to form it. The more important of these views will be considered further on in connection with our findings. In 190 S Doyon (12, 13) and his associates found that extensive degenerative changes in the liver were accompanied by a fall in the blood fibrinogen content of dogs poisoned by chloroform and phosphorus. They suggested the liver as...|$|R

30|$|Moreover, Skulmowski and Rey (2017 b) {{compiled}} several {{measures of}} cognitive load {{that can be}} used in <b>embodied</b> learning <b>studies,</b> such as behavioral, physiological, and metacognitive measures. Johnson-Glenberg and Megowan-Romanowicz (2017) emphasize that the nature of a learning test can greatly affect how well advantages of an embodied learning implementation can be detected. In their study, the benefits of a more embodied learning mode only became noticeable using an embodied learning test involving gestures (Johnson-Glenberg & Megowan-Romanowicz, 2017). Furthermore, Skulmowski and Rey (2017 b) recommend the use of repeated-measures designs when measuring cognitive load in educational studies involving embodiment.|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the growing}} {{organisational}} {{literature on the}} gendered body, we argue that much of this literature remains disembodied. We therefore seek to further <b>embody</b> the <b>study</b> of gendered bodies and organisations by viewing the body as lived gendered embodiment and by writing our own viscerally embodied experiences into our discussion. We first discuss the phenomenological approach to lived gendered embodiment and how this has been utilised in organisation studies. We then discuss how research on lived gendered embodiment might become more viscerally self-reflective. Throughout, we integrate these discussions with our own visceral and gendered self-reflections from teaching and research...|$|R

In this paper, a literature review of life cycle assessment and <b>embodied</b> carbon <b>studies</b> clearly signposts {{the need for more}} research on the embodied impacts of building services. Theoretical and practical challenges are identified in the use of LCA methods in construction along with possible solutions compatible with BIM-led design. A case study of horizontal, ducted fan coil units demonstrates that variations in embodied carbon of similar units could be associated with variations in total cooling capacity. This raises the possibility that metrics could subsequently be devised to predict embodied carbon for a generic class of fan coil units. Implications of these results are explored and recommendations made for future studies...|$|R

There were 2 blocks for pointing and 2 for grasping, with the order counterbalanced. Each block had 64 trials.|$|R

40|$|The {{cognitive}} science literature increasingly demonstrates that perceptual representations are activated during conceptual processing. Such {{findings suggest that}} the debate on whether conceptual processing is predominantly symbolic or perceptual has been resolved. However, studies too frequently provide evidence for perceptual simulations without addressing whether other factors explain dependent variables as well, and if so, to what extent. The current paper examines effect sizes computed from 137 experiments in 52 published <b>embodied</b> cognition <b>studies</b> to clarify the conditions under which perceptual simulations are most important. Results showed that effects of perceptual simulation tend to be as large as those of language statistics. Moreover, factors that can be associated with immediate processing (button press, word processing) tend to reduce the effect size of perceptual simulation. These findings are considered in respect to the Symbol Interdependency Hypothesis, which argues that language encodes perceptual information, with language statistics explaining quick, good-enough representations and perceptual simulation explaining more effortful, detailed representations...|$|R

40|$|The spatial-numerical {{association}} of response codes (SNARC) effect provides evidence for perceptual simulation of symbols. That is, parity judgments with one’s left hand are faster for lower numbers than for higher numbers (with one’s right hand, judgments are faster for higher numbers than for lower numbers). A perceptual simulation {{account of the}} SNARC effect leaves little room for a non-embodied explanation, even though recent {{studies have demonstrated that}} statistical linguistic data can explain findings from various <b>embodied</b> cognition <b>studies.</b> The current study explored whether such linguistic factors could also explain the SNARC effect. In a response time experiment, participants were asked to make parity judgments of number words.

Moreover, collocation frequencies (the previous number word and the following number word) also explained response times, further demonstrating that linguistic factors might {{play an important role in}} number processing.
