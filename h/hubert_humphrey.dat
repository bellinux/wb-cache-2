5|$|After {{his term}} in office ended, Sanford opened a law firm. He had agreed to serve as Johnson's {{campaign}} manager in 1968 just before Johnson's withdrawal on March 31. Sanford later took over as the campaign manager for the Democratic nominee <b>Hubert</b> <b>Humphrey</b> in his race against Republican Richard Nixon for the presidency.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Richard Nixon, the United States Republican Party nominee, won {{the presidential}} election, {{defeating}} Democrat <b>Hubert</b> <b>Humphrey</b> by seven-tenths {{of a percent}} of the popular vote. Nixon appointed H. R. Haldeman as his Chief of Staff; this position granted Haldeman a relatively large degree of control over the activities of the presidential administration. Haldeman had first worked for Nixon in 1956, during Nixon's successful bid for the vice-presidency under Dwight D. Eisenhower.|$|E

5|$|<b>Hubert</b> <b>Humphrey</b> brought {{national}} {{attention to the}} state with his address at the 1948 Democratic National Convention. Minnesotans have consistently cast their Electoral College votes for Democratic presidential candidates since 1976, longer than any other state. Minnesota {{is the only state}} in the nation that did not vote for Ronald Reagan in either of his presidential runs. Minnesota has gone to the Democratic Party in every presidential election since 1960, with the exception of 1972, when it was carried by Richard Nixon and the Republican Party.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hubert</b> <b>Humphrey</b> got {{his start}} in Minnesota {{politics}} in the early 1940s. He was an organizer of the Minnesota Democratic Party at the time, {{and he realized that}} the party's best chance of success would come if the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party merged with the Democratic party. Other party leaders had been discussing the merger, but Humphrey's idea was to keep the Farmer-Labor name {{in the name of the}} merged party, in order to gain the strength of thousands of loyal voters. Thus, the party got the name Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, Alaska celebrated 100 {{years since}} its {{purchase}} by the United States from Russia. To celebrate the event, Fairbanksans built A-67 (later Alaskaland and today Pioneer Park), {{a theme park}} celebrating the history of Fairbanks and Alaska. At a site away from downtown Fairbanks, it features pioneer cabins, historic exhibits, and the steamer SS Nenana, one of the steamboats that traveled Interior Alaska rivers during the gold rush era. The summer exposition that opened the park in July 1967 was attended by U.S. Vice President <b>Hubert</b> <b>Humphrey</b> but was plagued by rain, financial problems, and low attendance.|$|E
50|$|Nixon carried South Carolina with 38.09% of {{the vote}} to American Independent Party {{candidate}} George Wallace’s 32.30% and Democratic candidate <b>Hubert</b> <b>Humphrey's</b> 29.61%, a victory margin of 5.79%.|$|R
50|$|Wallace won 65.86% to Democrat <b>Hubert</b> <b>Humphrey's</b> 18.72%, a 47.13% margin. Republican Richard Nixon, while {{narrowly}} {{winning the}} election nationally, finished a distant third in Alabama with only 13.99%.|$|R
25|$|In 1968, the Communications Workers of America (CWA) used union members' dues, in part, {{to support}} Vice President <b>Hubert</b> <b>Humphrey's</b> {{campaign}} for President of the United States and Senator Joseph Tydings' re-election campaign.|$|R
5|$|Kennedy {{entered the}} race for the Democratic Party's {{nomination}} for president on March 16, 1968—four days after Senator Eugene McCarthy received {{a large percentage of the}} vote in the New Hampshire primary against the incumbent President (42% to Johnson's 49%). Two weeks later, a demoralized Johnson announced he was no longer seeking re-election. One month later, Vice President <b>Hubert</b> <b>Humphrey</b> announced he would seek the presidency. Humphrey did not participate in any primaries but he did obtain the support of many Democratic Party delegates. Following the California primary, Kennedy was in second place with 393delegates compared to Humphrey's 561 and McCarthy's 258.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy's body lay in repose at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York for {{two days}} before a funeral Mass was held on June 8. His body was interred near his brother John at Arlington National Cemetery. His death {{prompted}} the protection of presidential candidates by the United States Secret Service. <b>Hubert</b> <b>Humphrey,</b> the sitting Vice President {{at the time and}} also a presidential candidate, later {{went on to win the}} Democratic nomination for the presidency, but ultimately lost the election to Republican Richard Nixon.|$|E
5|$|To {{ensure the}} museum's longevity, Robbins lobbied the {{national}} legislature (Congress) to absorb his museum into the Smithsonian Institution, a federal group of museums and research centers. The House of Representatives approved this plan in 1978 with backing from Representatives John Brademas, Lindy Boggs, Ron Dellums, the Congressional Black Caucus, and former Vice President <b>Hubert</b> <b>Humphrey.</b> The Smithsonian directors adopted the museum {{the next year}} and began plans to move the collection from the townhouses into a proper museum. In 1981, the museum was renamed the National Museum of African Art.|$|E
50|$|Traffic {{problems}} were growing {{worse in the}} 1960s, and the county appealed to then Vice President <b>Hubert</b> H. <b>Humphrey</b> for relief. Vice President spoke to NASA and the U.S. Air Force and they agreed to help fund the widening. On August 16, 1962, the road widening was completed. Less than six years later the <b>Hubert</b> H. <b>Humphrey</b> Bridge was dedicated by <b>Hubert</b> H. <b>Humphrey</b> on March 1, 1968.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Hubert</b> H. <b>Humphrey</b> Building {{is located}} at 200 Independence Avenue SW in Washington, D.C. It is named for <b>Hubert</b> H. <b>Humphrey,</b> then serving as U.S. Senator from Minnesota, and {{formerly}} Vice President of the United States.|$|R

5|$|When the country's {{fortunes}} turned {{during the}} Great Depression, the violent Teamsters Strike of 1934 resulted in laws acknowledging workers' rights. A lifelong {{civil rights activist}} and union supporter, mayor <b>Hubert</b> <b>Humphrey</b> helped the city establish fair employment practices and a human relations council that interceded on behalf of minorities by 1946. In the 1950s, about 1.6% {{of the population of}} Minneapolis was nonwhite. Minneapolis contended with white supremacy, participated in desegregation and the civil rights movement, and in 1968 was the birthplace of the American Indian Movement.|$|E
5|$|In the 1968 Democratic primary campaign, McCarthy {{staged a}} strong showing. Robert Kennedy entered the race, President Johnson withdrew and Vice President <b>Hubert</b> <b>Humphrey</b> ran instead. While McGovern privately favored Kennedy, McCarthy and Humphrey were {{both from the}} {{neighboring}} state of Minnesota and publicly McGovern remained neutral. McGovern hosted all three as they campaigned for the June 4 South Dakota Democratic primary, {{which resulted in a}} strong win by Kennedy to go along with his win in the crucial California primary that night. McGovern spoke with Kennedy by phone minutes before Kennedy was assassinated in Los Angeles. The death of Bobby Kennedy left McGovern the most emotionally distraught he had ever been to that point in his life.|$|E
5|$|At the 1968 Republican National Convention, Agnew, who {{had earlier}} {{been asked to}} place Richard Nixon's name in nomination, was {{selected}} as running mate by Nixon and his campaign staff. Agnew's centrist reputation interested Nixon, and the law and order stance he had taken {{in the wake of}} civil unrest that year appealed to aides such as Pat Buchanan. Agnew made a number of gaffes during the campaign, but his rhetoric pleased many Republicans, and he may have made the difference in several key states. Nixon and Agnew defeated the Democratic ticket, incumbent vice president, <b>Hubert</b> <b>Humphrey</b> for president, and his running mate, Maine Senator Edmund Muskie. As vice president, Agnew was often called upon to attack the administration's enemies. In the years of his vice presidency, Agnew moved to the right, appealing to conservatives who were suspicious of moderate stances taken by Nixon. In 1972, Nixon and Agnew were reelected for a second term, defeating Senator George McGovern of South Dakota and former ambassador Sargent Shriver of Maryland.|$|E

5|$|Nixon {{was born}} in Yorba Linda, California. After {{completing}} his undergraduate studies at Whittier College, he graduated from Duke University School of Law in 1937 and returned to California to practice law. He and his wife Pat moved to Washington in 1942 {{to work for the}} federal government. He subsequently served on active duty in the U.S. Navy Reserve during World War II. Nixon was elected to the House of Representatives in 1946 and to the Senate in 1950. His pursuit of the Hiss Case established his reputation as a leading anti-communist and elevated him to national prominence. He was the running mate of Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Republican Party presidential nominee in the 1952 election. Nixon served for eight years as vice president – at 40, the second-youngest vice president in history. He waged an unsuccessful presidential campaign in 1960, narrowly losing to John F. Kennedy, and lost a race for Governor of California to Pat Brown in 1962. In 1968, he ran for the presidency again and was elected, defeating incumbent Vice President <b>Hubert</b> <b>Humphrey.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 7 November 1957, after Sputnik {{and under}} {{pressure}} to bring on a dedicated science advisor, Eisenhower created the President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC), which {{had the effect of}} eroding the AEC's monopoly over scientific advice. In stark contrast to the AEC, PSAC promoted a test ban and argued against Strauss's claims concerning its strategic implications and technical feasibility. In late 1957, the Soviet Union made a second offer of a three-year moratorium without inspections, but lacking any consensus within his administration, Eisenhower rejected it. In early 1958, the discord within American circles, particularly among scientists, was made clear in hearings before the Senate Subcommittee on Nuclear Disarmament, chaired by Senator <b>Hubert</b> <b>Humphrey.</b> The hearings featured conflicting testimony from the likes of Teller and Linus Pauling, as well as from Harold Stassen, who argued that a test ban could safely be separated from broader disarmament, and AEC members, who argued that a cutoff in nuclear production should precede a test ban.|$|E
