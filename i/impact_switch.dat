40|$|VeriSoft is a {{tool for}} {{systematically}} exploring the state spaces of systems composed of several concurrent processes executing arbitrary code written in full-fledged programming languages such as C or C++. The state space of a concurrent system is a directed graph that represents the combined behavior of all concurrent components in the system. By exploring its state space, VeriSoft can automatically detect coordination problems between the processes of a concurrent system. We report in this paper our analysis with VeriSoft of the "Heart-Beat Monitor" (HBM), a telephone switching application developed at Lucent Technologies. The HBM of a telephone switch determines the status of different elements connected to the switch by measuring propagation delays of messages transmitted via these elements. This information {{plays an important role}} in the routing of data in the switch, and can significantly <b>impact</b> <b>switch</b> performance. We discuss the steps of our analysis of the HBM using VeriSoft [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|RF MEMS {{capacitive}} switches show {{great potential}} for use in wireless communication device. However, their widespread insertion in commercial products requires further improvements in their long-term reliability. Dielectric charging {{is one of the}} factors that <b>impact</b> <b>switch</b> reliability. Dielectric charging is understood to mean the accumulation of electric charge in the insulating dielectric layer between the two electrodes of the capacitive RF MEMS switch. It can cause the switch to either remain stuck after removal of the actuation voltage or to fail to contact under application of pull-in voltage. Considerable effort has been devoted to both the experimental characterization of dielectric charging and the develop-ment of models {{that can be used to}} predict the impact of dielectric charging on electro-mechanical behav-ior of a capacitive switch. This investigation has led to useful quantitative information that can be used for predictive assessment of performance degradation of an RF MEMS capacitive switch during operation. Such capability serves as a computer-aided accelerated testing of the switch. For such capability to become readily available to designers, the pertinent computer model must be cast in a form that is seamlessly compatible with MEMS CAD tools such as Coventor’s Architect [1]. Over the past year work in our group focused on the development of such a model for the quantitative description of dielectric charging with the following attributes...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} threshold effects between public debt and {{economic growth in the}} Caribbean. The main finding is that there exists a threshold debt to gross domestic product (GDP) ratio of 55 – 56 percent. Moreover, the debt dynamics begin changing well before this threshold is reached. Specifically, at debt levels lower than 30 percent of GDP, increases in the debt-to-GDP ratio are associated with faster economic growth. However, as debt rises beyond 30 percent, the effects on economic growth diminishes rapidly and at debt levels reaching 55 – 56 percent of GDP, the growth <b>impacts</b> <b>switch</b> from positive to negative. Thus, beyond this threshold, debt becomes a drag on growth. ...|$|R

40|$|Micromechanical {{resonant}} displacement gain stages {{have been}} demonstrated that employ directionally engineered stiffnesses in resonant structures to effect displacement amplification from a driven input axis to an output axis. Specifically, the introduction of slots along the output axis of a 53 -MHz wine-glass mode disk resonator structure realizes a single gain stage with a measured input-to-output displacement amplification of 3. 08 x. Multiple such mechanical displacement gain stages can then be cascaded in series via half-wavelength beam couplers to achieve multiplicative gain factors; e. g., two cascaded gain stages achieve a total measured gain of 7. 94 x. The devices have also been operated as resonant switches, where displacement gain allows <b>impact</b> <b>switching</b> via actuation voltages of only 400 mV, which is 6 x smaller than for previous resoswitches without displacement gain. The availability of such high frequency displacement gain strategies for resonant switches may soon allow purely mechanical periodic switching applications (such as power amplifiers and power converters) with much higher efficiencies than current transistor-based versions.

The {{purpose of this paper}} is to provide empirical evidences about the <b>impact</b> of <b>switching</b> cost on customer loyalty by examining its mediating and moderating effects on the relationships between service value, customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. Specially, two difference types of switching costs, positive one and negative one, are proposed and tested independently in order to provide more insights about their impacts. The data about switching costs and other constructs are collected from 261 retail banking customers, and analysed using structural equation modelling and moderated path analysis. It is found that positive switching costs increase customer loyalty by partly transforming the effect of service value and customer satisfaction into customer loyalty. While negative switching cost only mediates the service value-loyalty relationship. Moreover, only negative switching cost has significant moderating effect on the satisfaction-loyalty relationships. Finally, the analysis reveals that negative switching cost might also weaken good <b>impacts</b> from positive <b>switching</b> cost on satisfaction-loyalty relationships. © Foundation of International Studies, 2017. and CSR, 2017...|$|R
