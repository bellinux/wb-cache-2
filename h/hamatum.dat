50|$|Eciton <b>hamatum</b> is {{a species}} of army ant in the {{subfamily}} Dorylinae; it is found from Mexico to central Brazil and Bolivia. The species differs from Eciton burchellii, in {{that it does not}} fan out into the underbrush when foraging. Rather, it forages in columns, often in trees and preying exclusively on the larvae of other social insects. Its prey are often broods of vespid wasps and ants of genera Dolichoderus and Camponotus, suggesting that E. <b>hamatum</b> is mainly an arboreal forager.|$|E

50|$|Several {{strains of}} Trichoderma have been {{developed}} as biocontrol agents against fungal diseases of plants. The various mechanisms include antibiosis, parasitism, inducing host-plant resistance, and competition. Most biocontrol agents are from the species T. harzianum, T. viride and T. <b>hamatum.</b> The biocontrol agent generally grows in its natural habitat on the root surface, and so affects root disease in particular, but can also be effective against foliar diseases.|$|E
5000|$|G. <b>hamatum</b> {{is a small}} stalked barnacle, with a body {{reaching}} a length of about 24 mm and a width of about 12.5 mm. The body is covered by 5 smooth white valves which form a keel with a wide base. The stalk (peduncle) that anchors the animal to the substrate is about 5 mm long. In South Africa, it is frequently found attached to the stems of hydrozoans.|$|E
50|$|The phoretic mite Planodiscus (Uropodidae) {{appears to}} exploit tactile or Wasmannian mimicry. The mite {{attaches}} {{itself to the}} tibia of its host ant, Eciton <b>hamatum.</b> The cuticular sculpturing of the mite's body as seen under the electron microscope strongly resembles the sculpturing of the ant's leg, as do the arrangements and number of the bristles (setae).

50|$|Since Bombus transversalis builds its nest on {{rainforest}} floors, {{it is very}} {{susceptible to}} predators on the ground. One such predator is the army ant Eciton <b>hamatum.</b> In a 100m2 area on the forest floor, there is a 50% chance of being raided by army ants over an eight-month period. The main defensive mechanism of Bombus transversalis against these attacks is through its nest structure. The colony {{is covered with a}} dense canopy of leaves and roots. So, the only way to invade the colony is through the single nest entrance which remains guarded if it is not raining. While this does not prevent all attacks, it is an effective mechanism at times.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{currently}} 17 validly described species of Paramoebidium. Several other species were described but are considered invalid {{due to a}} lack of descriptive detail and/or illustrations. Species have been described based on the morphological features of the thalli, cysts, and cystospores. Host type is also reported for species, but it is unclear how host specific different Paramoebidum species may be. Thallus shapes range from straight, short, and fat to long and sigmoidal, to branched or coiled. For example, P. curvum have short, coiled, thick thalli and are found in black fly larvae (Simuliidae), whereas P. <b>hamatum</b> have relatively long thalli that are consistently curved near the base giving them a [...] "candy cane" [...] appearance and are associated mainly with mayfly nymphs (Ameletidae and Baetidae) but also midge larvae. However, while Paramoebidium species are relatively common among trichomycete collections, description of new species is problematic due to the amount of intra- and interspecific variability of the morphological characters. Furthermore, no species have been obtained in axenic culture, so observations are limited to the individuals present at the time of host dissections and some stages of the life cycle (e.g. dispersal amoebae) may not be present in the collection.|$|E
50|$|Several {{cultural}} management {{methods can}} be effective in avoiding disease caused by Pythium aphanidermatum. The pathogen thrives in a moist environment, so {{it is important to}} prevent an excessive amount of moisture from building up in the plant media Irrigation that is too frequent and usage of soil that has poor drainage are common mistakes that result in inoculation. In addition, poor ventilation and insufficient exposure to sunlight can cause the plants themselves to accumulate moisture, potentially spreading disease. Sanitation of the soil using chemical treatment and minimizing the amount of plant debris in which the pathogen can survive is also an effective cultural practice.Fungicides are also effective control methods. Systemic and contact fungicides can be used, but in order to prevent the pathogen from becoming resistant to the treatment it is best to alternate between systemic and contact substances. Several chemical types can be used to manage the pathogen including acylalanines, thiadiazoles, carbamates, cinnamic acid derivatives, phosphonates, and phosphites. In general, these fungicides yield best results when used for preventative purposes.Biological control of the pathogen has also been successful. Bacteria and fungi can be used to treat Pythium aphanidermatum in turf, crops, and flowering greenhouse plants. Bacteria species include Bacillus subtilis, Candida oleophila, Enterobacter cloaceae, and Pseudomonas species. Fungi include many Trichoderma species, namely T. harziamum, T. virens, and T. <b>hamatum.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Because of the {{regularity}} {{and intensity}} of E. burchelli and E. <b>hamatum</b> swarms, many insect and bird species have evolved complex relationships with these ants. There are conopid flies (the entire genus Stylogaster) that are obligate associates of army ant raids, and females lay their eggs on insects (mostly crickets and roaches) flushed into the open by the ants, {{and there are also}} some tachinid flies that are somewhat similar in behavior. There are ant-mimicking staphylinid beetles, shaped like the ants they follow, that run with the swarm, some of them preying on stragglers or other insects injured or flushed by army-ant activity, though most of these are inquilines in the ant nest; these and other insects sometimes spend their entire lives hidden in Eciton colonies, often mimicking the ants or their larvae. Many species of birds — mostly cuckoos, woodcreepers, tanagers, and antbirds — feed near the swarms. About 50 of the approximately 200 species of antbirds specialize in preying on insects fleeing the ants, getting up to half their food this way. Some of these birds actively check army-ant bivouacs each morning and follow the foraging trail to the swarm front, where they take positions based on their species' relations in a dominance hierarchy. A swarm may be attended by as many as 25 birds of one or two [...] "professional" [...] species and individual birds of as many as 30 other species. There are even butterflies (esp. the family Hesperiidae) that feed almost exclusively on the feces of these bird species.|$|E

Distinct and reproducible fingerprints were obtained upon amplification of purified genomic DNA of T. <b>hamatum</b> 382 with the random primers OPE- 16, OPH- 19, and OPH- 20. Three amplified DNA fragments of 0. 35 (OPE- 160. 35), 0. 6 (OPH- 190. 6), and 0. 65 (OPH- 200. 65) kb were diagnostic for T. <b>hamatum</b> 382, clearly distinguishing it from 53 isolates of four other Trichoderma spp. tested. Some isolates of T. <b>hamatum</b> shared these low-molecular-weight fragments with T. <b>hamatum</b> 382. However, RAPD analysis of isolates of T. <b>hamatum</b> with all three random primers used in consecutive PCR tests distinguished T. <b>hamatum</b> 382 from other isolates of T. <b>hamatum.</b> These three RAPD amplicons were cloned and sequenced, and pairs of oligonucleotide primers for each cloned fragment were designed. Use of the primers in the PCR assay resulted in the amplification of DNA fragments {{of the same size}} as the cloned RAPD fragments from genomic DNA of T. <b>hamatum</b> 382. A combination of dilution plating on a semiselective medium for Trichoderma spp. and PCR, with the RAPD primers OPH- 19, OPE- 16, and OPH- 20 or the three sequence-characterized primers, was used successfully to verify the presence of T. <b>hamatum</b> 382 propagules in nine different soil, compost, and potting mix samples. All 23 Trichoderma isolates recovered on semiselective medium from commercial potting mixes fortified with T. <b>hamatum</b> 382 were identified as T. <b>hamatum</b> 382, whereas 274 Trichoderma isolates recovered from the other nine samples were negative in the PCR assay. Thus, this highly specific combination of techniques allowed detection and enumeration of propagules of T. <b>hamatum</b> 382 in fortified compost-amended potting mixes. Sequence-characterized amplified region markers also facilitated the development of a very simple procedure to amplify DNA of T. <b>hamatum</b> 382 directly from fortified compost-amended potting mixes...|$|E

Under laboratory conditions, T. <b>hamatum</b> seed treatment significantly enhanced pearl millet seed germination and seedling vigor. T. <b>hamatum</b> seed treatment resulted in systemic and durable immunity against pearl millet downy mildew disease under greenhouse and field conditions. T. <b>hamatum</b> treated seedlings responded to downy mildew infection with high lignification and callose deposition. Analysis of defense enzymes showed that T. <b>hamatum</b> treatment significantly enhanced {{the activities of}} glucanase, peroxidase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, and polyphenol oxidase in comparison to untreated control.

40|$|Graduation date: 1988 Isolates of Trichoderma spp. {{collected}} from snap bean foliage were tested for inhibition of grey mold of snap beans caused by Botrytis cinerea. In a detached blossom-pod assay an isolate of Trichoderma <b>hamatum</b> reduced pod rot by 94 % {{compared to the}} nontreated check. Control was comparable to that obtained with the fungicide vinclozolin. As few as 42 colony forming units (CFU) of T. <b>hamatum</b> per blossom reduced pod rot by 77 % compared to the nontreated check. Control was 97 % when 233 CFU per blossom were applied. Grey mold was reduced only when spores of T. <b>hamatum</b> were applied to blossoms prior to, or {{at the same time}} as, conidia of B. cinerea. In field studies conditions were very warm and dry. Because B. cinerea is primarily a cool weather pathogen, grey mold incidence was too low to detect meaningful differences among treatments. Differences in the incidence of pod rot caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, however, were observed among treatments in these field trials. Control of white mold by T. <b>hamatum</b> was comparable to that obtained with the fungicide vinclozolin.

40|$|Rhizocorallium <b>hamatum</b> (Fischer-Ooster 1858) is a trace fossil of the Zoophycos group, {{which is}} {{distinguished}} by its mostly horizontal, branched spreite lobes.

40|$|The obligate oomycete Sclerospora graminicola (Sacc.) Schroet, is the incitant of {{downy mildew}} disease, {{which is the}} main {{constraint}} in pearl millet production worldwide. Different elicitors from Trichoderma <b>hamatum</b> UOM 13, e. g. mycelial extract and cell wall glucans, were assessed for their resistance elicitation efficiency and the possible underlying mechanisms. Both mycelial extract and cell wall glucans of T. <b>hamatum</b> UOM 13 positively influenced seed quality parameters of pearl millet, significantly enhanced seed germination and seedling vigor {{in comparison to the}} untreated control. Seed priming with cell wall glucan elicitors of T. <b>hamatum</b> UOM 13 suppressed downy mildew on susceptible pearl millet seedlings under greenhouse conditions by induction of systemic host resistance. Of the different elicitor delivery methods tested, transplant root dip was more effective than seed treatment and foliar spray. A combination of transplant root dip + seed treatment + foliar spray was significantly more effective than the single delivery methods. The induced resistance corresponded to up regulation of genes of important defense proteins upon pathogen inoculation. Transcripts of genes of defense enzymes glucanase, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, peroxidase and polyphenoloxidase were significantly increased due to the T. <b>hamatum</b> UOM elicitor effect.

40|$|Mycoparasitism of fungal plant {{pathogens}} by Trichoderma {{species is}} a complex process that involves the production and coordinated secretion of cell-wall degrading enzymes. Genes implicated in mycoparasitism by Trichoderma atroviride contain motifs in the promoter region, designated MYRE 1 -MYRE 4, that are proposed to act as binding sites for a global inducer of the mycoparasitic response. The aim of our study was to establish whether these motifs also were present in Trichoderma <b>hamatum</b> and whether {{the presence of these}} motifs could predict co-expression when T. <b>hamatum</b> was confronted by a pathogen. Using a combination of targeted, degenerate and inverse PCR, homologues of the mycoparasitism-related genes ech 42 (chit 42), prb 1 and lam 1. 3 (xbg 1. 3 - 110), which encode an endochitinase, proteinase, and β- 1, 3 -glucanase, respectively, were cloned and sequenced from T. <b>hamatum.</b> Alignment of the promoter regions of the three genes revealed identical regions in the chit 42 and prb 1 promoters, which were 6 – 9 base pairs in length and conserved in position. Specifically, the regulator y motifs MYRE 1 -MYRE 4 were fully conserved, together with a fifth motif, identified by this research. A substrate assay designed to investigate the response of these genes from T. harzianum and T. <b>hamatum</b> to a simple carbon source (glycerol) showed that, in contrast to chit 42 and prb 1, xbg 1. 3 - 110 was not expressed. Further comparison of the expression patterns of these three genes between T. harzianum and T. <b>hamatum</b> using the glycerol substrate assay showed that no chit 42 or prb 1 expression could be detected in T. harzianum when it was grown under the same conditions as T. <b>hamatum.</b> This showed that the response of these genes to glycerol was species specific and that a single expression pattern for these genes was not common to all Trichoderma species. Confrontation assays were used to investigate the response of the three T. <b>hamatum</b> genes to the more complex substrate posed by the fungal pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Once again gene expression analysis showed that both chit 42 and prb 1 were co-expressed and moderately induced during confrontation against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Although xbg 1. 3 - 110 previously had been implicated in mycoparasitism by T. harzianum, this study detected no xbg 1. 3 - 110 expression during confrontation between T. <b>hamatum</b> and S. sclerotiorum. These findings show that the MYRE 1 -MYRE 4 together with MYRE 5 are present in two species of Trichoderma, T. atroviride and T. <b>hamatum</b> and that the presence of these motifs could predict co-expression in response to two carbon sources...|$|E

We further characterize the lettuce-T. <b>hamatum</b> interaction to show that bran extracts from GD 12 and a N-acetyl-β-D-glucosamindase-deficient mutant differentially promote growth in a concentration dependent manner, and these differences correlate with differences in the small molecule secretome.

40|$|We {{surveyed}} the Trichoderma (Hypocreales, Ascomycota) biodiversity in agricultural fields in four major agricultural provinces of East China. Trichoderma strains were identified based on molecular approaches and morphological characteristics. In three sampled seasons (spring, summer and autumn), 2078 strains were isolated and identified to 17 known species: T. harzianum (429 isolates), T. asperellum (425), T. <b>hamatum</b> (397), T. virens (340), T. koningiopsis (248), T. brevicompactum (73), T. atroviride (73), T. fertile (26), T. longibrachiatum (22), T. pleuroticola (16), T. erinaceum (16), T. oblongisporum (2), T. polysporum (2), T. spirale (2), T. capillare (2), T. velutinum (2), and T. saturnisporum (1).

40|$|Tomato {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} vegetables in the world, with the annual production reaching up to 160 million tons in 2011 (FAOSTAT 2013) and a 3 % annual increase in consumption. Like many other crops, tomato yield is hampered by various plant pathogens and pests. One of the most notorious fungal pathogens of tomato is Botrytis cinerea, the causative agent of grey mould that is able to infect more than 200 plant species. Nowadays B. cinerea management is still largely relying on chemical treatments, which do not always lead to a successful outcome, mainly due to the multiple modes of infection of B. cinerea, its ability to survive as sclerotia in plants debris for extended periods, as well as the high frequency of fungicide resistance development. Hence, seeking alternative or complementary approaches to control B. cinerea is an urgent matter. Trichoderma spp. could contribute to such an alternative management approach. They are cosmopolitan soil fungi that can be isolated from all latitudes of the earth. Being beneficial to plants, some Trichoderma strains are already being used in agriculture as biocontrol organisms (BCOs). Previously it was found that Trichoderma spp. have direct antagonistic effects on many plant pathogens, including B. cinerea, which has been a focal point of the biocontrol community for a long time. To date, evidence is accumulating that Trichoderma spp. can also have indirect effects on pathogens, through triggering induced systemic resistance (ISR) in plants. In the first part of this doctoral thesis, we provide an overview of fungal biocontrol organisms in disease control of tomato, including Trichoderma-mediated ISR in tomato, as well as a more specific description of the biocontrol research in our group, which is centered around the Trichoderma <b>hamatum</b> T 382 -B. cinerea interaction. In order to unravel the ISR molecular mechanisms in tomato triggered by our model BCO Trichoderma <b>hamatum</b> T 382 against B. cinerea, we first developed a robust lab-scale hydroponics system for ISR disease assays with the tripartite interaction T. <b>hamatum</b> T 382 - tomato - B. cinerea, with ISR being characterized by significantly smaller B. cinerea lesion diameters. After confirming the robustness and reliability of the hydroponics system, we extrapolated our findings by replacing the components in the tripartite model system, using different Trichoderma strains and tomato cultivars. Several ISR-positive and ISR-negative strains were identified. In a next step, the further B. cinerea disease development in tomato plants pre-treated with two ISR-positive Trichoderma strains was monitored, and a reduction in leaf chlorosis and sporulating lesions was demonstrated in plants pre-treated by ISR-positive Trichoderma strains. Additionally, we found that the efficiency of Trichoderma-mediated ISR is dependent on the tomato genotype. The molecular basis of ISR in tomato mediated by T. <b>hamatum</b> T 382 was unraveled by a transcriptome analysis. To elucidate the mechanisms behind this complex tripartite interaction, a transcriptome study of leaves from tomato plants pre-treated or not with T. <b>hamatum</b> T 382 was carried out, both before (ISR-prime) and after (ISR-boost) B. cinerea infection. The large number of differentially expressed genes obtained allowed us to classify them according to the biological pathways in which they are involved. By focusing on pathways instead of genes, a holistic picture of the mechanisms underlying ISR emerged. More specifically, metabolism of jasmonic acid, ethylene, abscisic acid and phenylpropanoids, as well as several MAMPs (microbe associated molecular pattern) related signaling events were found to be highly induced. Since our research group performed a similar transcriptome analysis on the tripartite interaction T. <b>hamatum</b> T 382 - Arabidopsis thaliana - B. cinerea, a comparison of the ISR mechanisms between these two plant species was made. In order to validate the putative role of hormones and secondary metabolism in T. <b>hamatum</b> T 382 -mediated ISR in tomato, several mutants and a transgenic line were employed for B. cinerea disease assays. The mutants were impaired in a hormone-related pathway (systemin signaling, jasmonic acid biosynthesis, ethylene signaling, abscisic acid biosynthesis) or in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway. The results of the disease assays suggest that systemin signaling, biosynthesis of jasmonic acid and abscisic acid, as well as phenylpropanoid biosynthesis indeed are essential components in T. <b>hamatum</b> T 382 -mediated ISR in tomato. Given that the genes categorized in most of these biological processes were up-regulated in our transcriptome data in ISR-prime, the results obtained from the mutant disease assays confirm the results from the transcriptome analysis. The ISR inducing ability of Trichoderma spp. has been reported to be closely associated with their rhizosphere-competence, which refers to their ability to colonize plant roots. Therefore, root colonization patterns by selected Trichoderma strains (both ISR-positive and ISR-negative ones) were first characterized by bright-field microscopy of tomato transverse root sections. However, we could not relate the colonization pattern of the tested strains to their ISR-inducing capacity in tomato, as this pattern was the same for both ISR-positive and ISR-negative strains. In a next step, in order to better visualize the growth of T. <b>hamatum</b> T 382 in the vicinity of tomato roots, an autotrophic in vitro system was optimized. The ISR phenotype in this system was confirmed before proceeding to an in-depth microscopic study. Using scanning electron microscopy, we were able to observe the propagules of T. <b>hamatum</b> T 382 (both conidia and hyphae) with high magnification and great clarity. Moreover, the green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagged T. <b>hamatum</b> T 382 was constructed, which provided us with an additional tool to investigate whether T. <b>hamatum</b> T 382 could enter tomato roots. Observation with confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that T. <b>hamatum</b> T 382 mainly closely adhered to the root surface, although appressoria-like structures commonly used by fungi to penetrate plant tissues, could be observed, in addition to occasional root penetrating hyphae. Finally, a general discussion on the results obtained in this thesis is presented, as well as some outlooks for future continuation of this research. By switching the plant partner from the originally studied model system T. <b>hamatum</b> T 382 - Arabidopsis thaliana - B. cinerea to a major crop plant tomato, this study not only provides extensive insight on molecular mechanism of T. <b>hamatum</b> T 382 -mediated ISR in tomato against B. cinerea, but also contributed to the translation of knowledge on basic biological processes (on model plants) to efficient applications in the field.

Trichoderma <b>hamatum</b> strain GD 12 is unique in that it can promote plant growth, activate biocontrol against pre- and post-emergence soil pathogens and can induce systemic resistance to foliar pathogens. This study extends previous work in lettuce to demonstrate that GD 12 can confer beneficial agronomic traits to other plants, providing examples of plant growth promotion in the model dicot, Arabidopsis thaliana and induced foliar resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae in the model monocot rice. We further characterize the lettuce-T. <b>hamatum</b> interaction to show that bran extracts from GD 12 and an N-acetyl-β-D-glucosamindase-deficient mutant differentially promote growth in a concentration dependent manner, and these differences correlate with differences in the small molecule secretome. We show that GD 12 mycoparasitises a range of isolates of the pre-emergence soil pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and that this interaction induces a further increase in plant growth promotion above that conferred by GD 12. To understand the genetic potential encoded by T. <b>hamatum</b> GD 12 and to facilitate its use as a model beneficial organism to study plant growth promotion, induced systemic resistance and mycoparasitism we present de novo genome sequence data. We compare GD 12 with other published Trichoderma genomes and show that T. <b>hamatum</b> GD 12 contains unique genomic regions with the potential to encode novel bioactive metabolites that may contribute to GD 12 's agrochemically important traits.

40|$|Four biocontrol�agents, namely : Trichoderma harzianum, T. <b>hamatum,</b> Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas fluorescens, {{have been}} tested for their {{potential}} antagonism for controlling fusarium wilt, verticillium wilt and early blight diseases of tomato. In vitro studies showed that culture filtrates of all antagonistic organisms significantly decrease the spore germination and germ tube-length of the tested pathogens, F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici, Verticillium dahliae and Alternaria solani. The linear growth and sporulation of the concerned pathogens were also inhibited the degree of inhibition was varied according to the tested antagonistic filtrate. In vivo studies, three treatments were applied; inoculation of the soil with antagonist period to sowing, soaking tomato seeds in the filtrate of the tested antagonist before sowing and coating of tomato seeds with spores of the antagonist before planting. Soil inoculation and seed coating with T. <b>hamatum</b> spores completely controlled the concerned diseases and improved the yield. However, P. fluorescens seed coating controlled the early blight disease and improved the tomato growth as well. Concerning the chemical assessment, T. <b>hamatum</b> soil inoculation and seed coating treatments gave the highest increase for chlorophyll a, b and cartenoids. Also the same treatments showed the highest increase of phenolic compounds (free and conjugated) and the lowest percentage for sugars content of tomato leaves infected with the concerned pathogens...|$|E

Antibiotics produced by young T. <b>hamatum</b> cultures and G. virens in culture filtrate experiments inhibited growth of P. cinnamomi and P. citricola. with filtrate from 4 -day-old cultures of G. virens showing the greatest potential for biocontrol.

The studies were conducted in laboratory conditions. The antagonistic effect of the isolates of Bacillus spp., Pseudomonas spp., Trichoderma <b>hamatum</b> and Trichoderma koningii was determined towards such pathogenic fungi as Alternaria alternata., Botrytis cinerea, Fusarium culmorum, Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium solani, Phoma exigua var exigua, Pythium irregulare, Rhizoctonia solani and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum.
