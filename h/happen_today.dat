This {{is part of the}} unorthodox Internet-based marketing scheme the two used to promote the album, inspired by the success of Radiohead's 2007 album In Rainbows and the self-promotional strategies of Nine Inch Nails for the albums Year Zero, Ghosts I–IV, and The Slip. In September 2008, Jon Yeo created a music video for the track featuring the paintings of Eno.|$|E

Based in part on the success of marketing this album, representatives of Topspin were invited to teach a course on music marketing at BerkleeCollegeof Music in September 2009 and IanC.Rogers led a panel discussion at SouthbySouthwest on options for independent music artists. The album's multiple formats have been praised as a method of incentivizing buying physical copies of albums.|$|E

2500|$|The album has {{received}} overall positive reviews. Simon Cosyns of The Sun wrote that [...] "there are no boundaries to Byrne's work" [...] {{and called the}} album [...] "strangely compelling." [...] Other reviewers have found the album too esoteric, such as Chris Barrett, writing for the Metro Pulse, who concludes his review writing [...] "Recommended. But, as mentioned, probably not for everybody." [...] Thom Jurek of Allmusic gave the album three out of five stars, calling it [...] "pleasant for a while, but lightweight" [...] noting that buyers {{would have to be}} [...] "Byrne enthusiast... to find this set of compositions engaging in its own right, or addicted to very specifically themed cinematically inspired music, to truly appreciate what's on offer here." [...] Some reviewers have noted the emotional sweep of the music, with John Constine of Tiny Mix Tapes calling it [...] "a wide breadth of emotions... at times pensive and ominous, at others curious and wistful." [...] In addition, the spiritual themes have been compared to Sufjan Stevens by several commentators as well as Byrne's other 2008 album, the Brian Eno collaboration Everything That Happens Will <b>Happen</b> <b>Today.</b>|$|E
2500|$|According to James Gunn, one of Wells's major {{contributions}} to the science fiction genre was his approach, which he referred to as his [...] "new system of ideas". In his opinion, the author should always strive to make the story as credible as possible, even if both the writer and the reader knew certain elements are impossible, allowing the reader to accept the ideas as something that could really <b>happen,</b> <b>today</b> referred to as [...] "the plausible impossible" [...] and [...] "suspension of disbelief". While neither invisibility nor time travel was new in speculative fiction, Wells added a sense of realism to the concepts which the readers were not familiar with. He conceived {{the idea of using}} a vehicle that allows an operator to travel purposely and selectively forwards or backwards in time. The term [...] "time machine", coined by Wells, is now almost universally used to refer to such a vehicle. He explained that while writing The Time Machine, he realized that [...] "the more impossible the story I had to tell, the more ordinary must be the setting, and the circumstances in which I now set the Time Traveller were all that I could imagine of solid upper-class comforts." [...] In [...] "Wells's Law", a science fiction story should contain only a single extraordinary assumption. Being aware the notion of magic as something real had disappeared from society, he, therefore, used scientific ideas and theories as a substitute for magic to justify the impossible. Wells's best-known statement of the [...] "law" [...] appears in his introduction to The Scientific Romances of H.G. Wells (1933), ...|$|E
