5|$|As part of baseball's {{expansion}} in the early 1960s, a franchise was awarded to New York, {{to play in the}} National League beginning in 1962, and {{to be known as the}} New York Mets. It was hoped that the new team would be supported by the many former Giant and Dodger fans left without a team when the franchises moved to California after the 1957 season. There were rumors through the 1961 season that Stengel would be the manager, but he initially showed no interest in managing a team that, given the rules for the expansion draft, was unlikely to be competitive. George Weiss had been forced out as Yankee general manager and hired by the Mets. He wanted Stengel as manager, and after talks with the Mets principal owners, Joan Whitney Payson and M. Donald Grant, Stengel was introduced as Mets manager at a press conference on October 2, 1961. Leonard Koppett of The New York Times suggested that Stengel took the job to <b>give</b> <b>something</b> back to the game that had been his life for half a century.|$|E

25|$|The Foundation had {{its origins}} in a wish by Sir Bobby {{on the eve of}} his 75th {{birthday}} to leave behind a legacy for future cancer victims in the North East and <b>give</b> <b>something</b> back to the NHS in return for the care he had received in his own battles against cancer.

Much of the money required was donated by Roddick. As a result of this donation, a new building built with this money was named The Roddick Enterprise Centre (normally abbreviated to 'REC'). The Littlehampton College also hosts 'Roddick Days' such as 'Day of Action' and 'One World'; these events allow students to <b>give</b> <b>something</b> back to their local community and learn about what is happening around them.|$|E
25|$|Scrambling for a home, Tatham seriously {{considered}} playing in Honolulu for its inaugural 1984 season, but settled on Tulsa, Oklahoma—even though {{the city had}} not even been included in a list of possible expansion sites for the USFL. However, Tatham had roots in Oklahoma (his father had moved to California during the Great Depression), and felt that putting his team there would <b>give</b> <b>something</b> back to the state. He christened his team the Oklahoma Outlaws. The club was the second major-league sports team {{to play in the}} state, after the North American Soccer League's Tulsa Roughnecks, and played at Skelly Stadium.|$|E
25|$|Moreton, however, is not unconcerned of the {{situation}} of the decent poor people and vagrants, so he suggests that barracks or barns should be built at convenient ends of the town, where all vagrants should be obliged to render themselves at a stated hour, where they should have clean straw allowed them, and be kept orderly and out of harm's way; they may be let loose if they have apparent means of honest livelihood, otherwise they should be sent to the workhouse of their respective parish, or to a general workhouse, of which there is great need; and of which more hereafter. This proposition can be valued as an hint of the eighteenth-century ambivalent frame of mind towards these individuals. On one hand restrictions and penalties were vigorously demanded by the English society. On the other hand, not only some kinds of begging activities were allowed but, common people strongly felt a social and religious obligation to <b>give</b> <b>something</b> or to answer a plea.|$|E

500|$|Throughout his {{managerial}} career, Wenger has trusted {{his players}} to perform {{and learn from}} their own mistakes, a quality Vieira regards as his biggest strength and weakness.
