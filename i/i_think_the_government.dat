A war-ship, under a hot-headed captain, might be decoyed into hostilities; the taxes might begin to come in again; the three Powers might become otherwise engaged and the little stage of Samoa escape observation--indeed, I know not what they hope, but they hope something. There lives on in their breasts a remainder coal of ambition still unquenched. Or it is only so that I can explain a late astonishing sally of his Honour's. In a long and elaborate judgment he has pared the nails, and indeed removed the fingers, of his only rival, the municipal magistrate. For eighteen months he has seen the lower Court crowded with affairs, the while his own stood unfrequented like an obsolete churchyard. He may have remarked with envy many hundred cases passing through his rival's hands, cases of assault, cases of larceny, ranging {{in the last four}} months from 2s. up to £1 12s.; or he may have viewed with displeasure that despatch of business which was characteristic of the magistrate, Mr. Cooper. An end, at least, has been made of these abuses. Mr. Cooper is henceforth to draw his salary for the minimum of public service; and all larcenies and assaults, however trivial, must go, according to the nationality of those concerned, before the Consular or the Supreme Courts.|$|E

Will they ever be reproduced for other celebrations of the glorious 29th of July?--I think not; the Government which vowed {{that there should be}} no more persecutions of the press, was, on that very 29th, seizing a Legitimist paper, for some real or fancied offence against it: it had seized, and was seizing daily, numbers of persons merely suspected of being disaffected (and you may fancy how liberty is understood, when some of these prisoners, the other day, on coming to trial, were found guilty and sentenced to ONE day's imprisonment, after THIRTY-SIX DAYS' DETENTION ON SUSPICION). <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> which follows such a system, cannot be very anxious about any farther revolutionary fêtes, and that the Chamber may reasonably refuse to vote more money for them.

40|$|Cue: One of {{the tragedies}} of the AIDS {{pandemic}} {{is that some}} of those who know they are HIV positive, or have even developed AIDS itself, continue to spread the disease. Many may feel they have nothing to lose. But how can this kind of attitude be changed? Clearly an important step is to make HIV and AIDS sufferers feel that they are still valued by their society - that their lives are not worthless. Achieving that goal requires action on many fronts: governments need to develop policies to prevent discrimination against HIV/AIDS sufferers, and there also need to be employment opportunities for those who have been weakened by the disease. Creating support networks and increasing public awareness about the disease are also important. This kind of holistic approach to AIDS is being strongly advocated by a charity working in Zimbabwe, Christian Care. In this report Sylvia Jiyane talks to Joseph Gari, an advocacy officer for the organisation. She begins be asking him to explain the links between agriculture and health. IN:		?There is a link between ?? OUT:		??. negative impact on our agriculture. ? DUR?N	 3 ? 36 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Joseph Gari, an advocacy officer for Christian Care Zimbabwe. Transcript Gari	There is a link between agriculture and health. A healthy labour force is a prerequisite for a successful agricultural production. So what it means is like if the labour force is not healthy then there is no genuine agricultural production to talk of. On the other side agriculture has also an effect on health if its not done in the proper way. I mean in terms of sanitation. Like irrigation and the like, they can help breed mosquitoes and then {{at the end of the}} day we have malaria and that malaria?s going to affect people?s health. We can have other diseases like Bilharzia, which can be caused if agriculture?s not done in the proper way. Jiyane		Which one would you say is number one problem for Zimbabwe as we speak? Gari	I think the HIV/AIDS pandemic is the problem that is actually facing the nation. Jiyane	And you as an organisation, what are you doing to help the situation? Gari	We have got AIDS awareness programmes, advocacy programmes, some income generating programmes which are all aimed at helping people who are HIV/AIDS infected and also those who are affected. Jiyane	Would you cite an example? Gari	Yes we have got a programme which is done in urban area on the periphery of the Bulawayo city, that is a mushroom project. We?ve realised that this project could help those people who are both affected by HIV and infected in the sense that it doesn?t require a lot of manual input. Simply to take a bucket to water the mushroom and at the end of the day they can have something that they can eat and also have income because they will sell the mushrooms to the people. Jiyane	Talking about the same mushroom project, how does the community appreciate the growing of mushrooms since they are HIV positive? Gari	Very good comments are coming out of it. One good part of it is like we are also providing the material that is needed for that programme to be successful as well as the expertise. So we have trained people, now that people are trained they are able to grow mushroom on their own. So they are appreciating the programme because one they are getting the income after selling the mushroom. Two, they are also getting nutrients from that mushroom. Jiyane	And you mentioned advocacy earlier on. How does this advocacy come in to this programme? Gari	We have realised that in our country there is no policy per se, that is actually catering for the people who are affected by HIV and AIDS. So we are trying as an organisation to lobby for changes in that area to the Government that let?s recognise the status of the people who are living with HIV/AIDS. Let?s do something, let?s draft a policy that is going to accommodate those people so that at the end of the day these people are not discriminated against. On the same issue <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> should also channel some of their resources towards rehabilitating people with HIV/AIDS. What we are trying to do is like we are trying to increase their life span so that maybe if they live longer the more impact they have on our agriculture because they have also a role to play in agricultural production. Jiyane	And what would be your message to people out there in Zimbabwe about this HIV and AIDS, seeing that it?s becoming a number one problem in the agricultural industry? Gari	Having realised that HIV/AIDS is becoming a new frontier to development in general, into agriculture in particular my message to the people is like, let?s stand up together, we fight discrimination, we fight this spread of AIDS through an enhanced network. If it means forming partnership, let?s form partnership and try to fight this disease HIV/AIDS in all our efforts, so that at the end of the day its not going to have a negative impact on our agriculture. End of track. An advocacy officer for Christian Care Zimbabwe stresses the importance of giving both economic and moral support to those with HIV/AIDS, so that they can continue to be productive members of societ...|$|E
40|$|Using modern {{information}} and communication technologies Suggested introduction: When did you last use a computer? What were you using it for? Maybe you have never used one and don?t feel you need to. For most people who have started using computers in the last ten years, probably the most popular service that computers offer is email. For sending messages to family, friends and colleagues, email can be the quickest and most reliable method. Computers can also be a valuable source of information, allowing users to search for up-to-date news, weather reports, health or even market information, through the internet. Interestingly however, research suggests that far fewer people use computers as a source of information, certainly compared to the number who use email. The reason? Perhaps the expense of paying for time online, or not knowing how to search for the right information. And many of us are simply unaware of what useful information might be available, and continue to rely on other sources, such as TV, radio, newspapers and friends. Faye Durrant, Professor of Library and Information studies at the University of the West Indies in Jamaica believes strongly that computer-based technologies have a lot to offer, not just to highly skilled professionals, but also to rural people making a living from agriculture and other local industries. At a recent conference in Belize, she, and other participants, discussed the power of these technologies for rural development; afterwards, they spoke to Susanna Thorp about their own experiences. IN:		?Well certainly in terms of the uptake? OUT:	?the information that they require. DUR?N		 5 ? 59 ? Back announcement: Thomas Burton ending that report on the current usage of ICTs - Information and Communication Technologies - for rural development in the Caribbean. Transcript Durrant	Well certainly in terms of the uptake of the Internet that is increasing daily. So I think {{that is one of the}} ways in which we can get a large region like this, one point on the Internet can be accessible to everybody in the whole region. Thorp	But for vulnerable groups this presumably is not something that they necessarily can access particularly on an individual level? Durrant	What has been happening and certainly in Jamaica is the development of tele centres via the public library system where there are public access computers which people can go in and use for this kind of information without having to have their own dedicated computer. Thorp	And what about the introduction of these things, these technologies in schools that the children are learning at the new generation? Durrant	Yes certainly that is where the children are catching on very fast to the whole facility of email and searching for information on the web. What we want to ensure is that when they search they can find a spot where they have reliable information that will give them the basis for long term decision making on their diet and the way in which they develop their own personal nutrition strategies. Thorp	Because there isn?t a lack of information, it is actually people knowing where to go to find it? Durrant	Exactly and even having it in the form because now children want multimedia, they don?t want any ten pages of text telling them something. They want something that jumps out at them and says, ?Look at me!? So it is also the way in which information might be packaged for them at that age and stage. NARR	It is not only in Jamaica that the use of computers is growing. Andrea Robbin, Head of the Nutrition Unit within the Ministry of Health and the Environment told me about the situation in St Vincent and the Grenadines. Robbin	I think that the youth are embracing, for example, computer based technologies and older persons maybe a little more tentative and sometimes the policymakers are the older persons. But in St Vincent and the Grenadines we have a government Internet, a website and government Intranet as well as government email. So those are opportunities for sharing information that we really want to use and our nutrition unit in the Ministry of Health and Environment is already submitting information to the St Vincent and the Grenadines government website in terms of the newspaper articles and some of the radio scripts that we produce. But I think that there is a need for access for the consumers in terms of Internet access to that website and to maybe other websites related to food and nutrition security. Hardware in terms of actual computers. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> has programmes to introduce computers to maybe community resource centres and learning centres, but I do not know in terms of how far it reaches. Thorp	So that people could go to that community resource centre and download information that they needed on recipes or good nutrition or breastfeeding for instance? Robbin	Absolutely or backyard gardening best practices, or other aspects of food and nutrition security whether it is from an agricultural perspective, health perspective, nutrition perspective. NARR	And while the use of computers to access information is starting to grow, they also have other uses. Thomas Burton, from Jamaica?s Rural Agricultural Development Authority, RADA, explains how his organisation is using them to record and analyse information, as well as provide it. Burton	Well at the moment RADA is trying to implement an ICT based information system, which will benefit both the extension officers and the farmers. We are at the moment carrying out a national registration programme for all farmers, so that we can know the numbers with whom we are interacting and can make plans to satisfy their various demands. This information that is garnered will also give the size of the holdings that they are operating, their locations, what they are planting at the various times and what is expected, times of harvesting and output possible. It will also give a possibility on projected price so the farmers will know how much they can expect to earn from a given unit area of production. The extension officer will input this data on his computer system and then farmers can also come to the office and get information from him on what has been required in the different market centres at different times. Thorp	And how do farmers feel, do you think farmers are willing to embrace new technologies in order to get the information that they require? Burton	They are willing to embrace the technology but the older farmers are at a disadvantage in that they have not been trained in how to use these devices. So what we are hoping is that the children who are currently in school and are being afforded the opportunity to learn how to use the computers for example can now pass on information to their parents. The problem also is that many of these resource deficient farmers are not able to buy computer equipment so they will have to probably depend on what is at the library or what is in the community centre and this can slow down the process. So we are hoping that as the price of the equipment gets lower, then more persons will be able to access this. However if they cannot access it in their own homes we have 60 extension offices across the island which are being equipped with computers so the farmers can go to these centres and get the information that they require.

The success of the title applications, he maintained, did {{not depend on the}} odometer readings, although Schmuck might have been committing mail fraud if he had mailed the original odometer slips himself.

An anarchy that would deluge the land with blood seems to me detestable and wicked. But <b>I</b> cannot but <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> has {{made a terrible mistake}} by its severity. These people are all enthusiastic fanatics. They see that things are not as they should be, and they would destroy everything to right them. Hate their aims as one may, one must admit that their conduct is heroic. Few have quailed in their trials. All preserve a calmness of demeanour that even their judges and executioners cannot but admire. They seem made of iron; they suffer everything, give up everything, dare everything for their faith; they die, as the Christian martyrs died in Rome, unflinching, unrepentant. If they have become as wild beasts, severity has made them so. Their propaganda was at first a peaceful one. It is cruelty that has driven them to use the only weapon at their disposal, assassination.|$|R
60|$|Be {{that as it}} may, <b>I</b> do not <b>think</b> {{that any}} {{unbiased}} traveler will doubt that the best possible selection has been made, presuming always, as we may presume in the discussion, that Montreal could not be selected. I take for granted that the rejection of Montreal {{was regarded as a}} sine qua non in the decision. To me it appears grievous that this should have been so. It is a great thing for any country to have a large, leading, world-known city, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>the</b> <b>government</b> should combine with the commerce of the country in carrying out this object. But commerce can do a great deal more for government than government can do for commerce. Government has selected Ottawa as the capital of Canada; but commerce has already made Montreal the capital, and Montreal will be the chief city of Canada, let government do what it may to foster the other town. The idea of spiting a town because there has been a row in it {{seems to me to be}} preposterous. The row was not the work of those who have made Montreal rich and respectable. Montreal is more centrical than Ottawa--nay, it is as nearly centrical as any town can be. It is easier to get to Montreal from Toronto than to Ottawa; and if from Toronto, then from all that distant portion of Upper Canada back of Toronto. To all Lower Canada Montreal is, as a matter of course, much easier of access than Ottawa. But having said so much in favor of Montreal, I will again admit that, putting aside Montreal, the best possible selection has been made.|$|R
5000|$|Contradicting those claims, in November 2002 Ritter was on CNN's crossfire and {{cautioned against}} the {{invasion}} citing serious concern that Saddam would use chemical weapons {{in defense of}} Baghdad:As I testified to the U.S. Senate in 1998, Iraq has the indigenous capability right now to reconstitute a chemical weapons program {{within a matter of}} weeks. And my concern is if we continue to push for military action against Iraq, and once the writing becomes clear on the wall -- and believe me, if Saddam Hussein doesn't understand that President Bush is dead serious about going to war against him now, I don't know when he'll be -- when he'll recognize that. But at some point, I believe that Iraq will seek to reconstitute militarized nerve agent that will be used in defense of Baghdad. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> Iraqi <b>government's</b> efforts to acquire significant stockpiles of atropine are an indication that this is the direction that Saddam Hussein is heading. In 2002, he heavily criticized the Bush administration and Media outlets for using the testimony of alleged nuclear scientist Khidir Hamza as a rationale for invading Iraq; We seized the entire records of the Iraqi Nuclear program, especially the administrative records. We got a name of everybody, where they worked, what they did, and the top of the list, Saddam's [...] "Bombmaker" [...] was a man named Jafar Dhia Jafar, not Khidir Hamza, and if you go down the list of the senior administrative personnel you will not find Hamza's name in there. In fact, we didn't find his name at all. Because in 1990, he didn't work for the Iraqi Nuclear Program. He had no knowledge of it because he worked as a kickback specialist for Hussein Kamel in the Presidential Palace.|$|R

In criticism of the now deposed leader, Ben Ali, she created a cartoon character, a cat named Willis, in January 2011, as an outlet on Facebook to air her feelings about the Arab Spring, and she now has over 41,000 followers. [...] She confessed that she draws [...] "to take the heat off certain situations". Due to the Ali regime's strict policies on criticism, to avoid being thrown into prison she was careful to [...] "learn to trick, to suggest rather than to say". She has said of her artwork and the revolution: [...] "For me it’s not a job. It’s a freedom. Like I’m being born. Before the revolution, I was a zombie. <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> but <b>I</b> cannot express myself. So I didn’t feel like I was alive. With the revolution I was born, like a baby. My first screaming was my drawing. And now for me its a revolution in my art, totally. I can finally express myself and say what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> and criticize <b>the</b> <b>government.</b> For me I can finally do my passion: cartoons."

40|$|Executive and {{legislative}} actions after 9 / 11 demonstrate {{a shift in}} the way <b>the</b> federal <b>government</b> combats terrorism. Traditional law enforcement entities have been given new powers, and military and intelligence personnel have taken on a new prominence. Criminal prosecutions are still being brought against persons suspected of terrorist activity, but <b>the</b> <b>government</b> seems less willing to accord criminal trials a central role in anti-terror efforts. In short, we are seeing the creation of a “new criminal process” for terrorism, a process that in many cases bypasses federal courts and operates wholly outside the territorial boundaries of the United States. All of these actions, moreover, react to the perceived emergency created by the 9 / 11 attacks. Government officials have argued that a state of emergency exists and – critically – that it is unclear when the emergency will end. Other public figures and the media have largely agreed. “Everything has changed” has become the common theme, and the new criminal process provides a legal ratification of that change – a legal structure for a state of emergency. This essay considers the new criminal process and the perception of emergency out of which it grows from a variety of angles. Although <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> federal <b>government</b> has shifted too far in favor of military and other solutions to terrorism at the expense of traditional criminal processes, my position rest upon a chain of reasoning and a baseline that the new criminal process contests. That deeper contest and its implications are the focus of this essay. To that end, I describe the attributes for the new criminal process, and provide the arguments for and against the traditional and new criminal processes. I also consider the legality of the new criminal process and conclude that it comports with constitutional norms (which may say more about the malleability of constitutional norms than anything else). The underlying assertion of this essay is that the new criminal process may not be so new. Rather, it may be the latest step in a broad shift in our approach to governing, where pervasive authority is increasingly valued over the constraints of law. This change brings with it modification and dilution of rights, but also the possibility of their expansion within the context of also-expanded state power. Nor is this change occurring without justification. Terrorism is a real policy issue, and rational, liberal-minded people support increased state power to counter the threat. Be that as it may, the critical point is that we are experiencing the modification of the processes by which our government investigates and imposes punishment on people, and {{the fact that some of}} these processes arise in the context of the war on terror means, not that those processes are about fighting terrorism, but rather that those processes – the new criminal process – inevitably will and have already begun to generalize...|$|R
