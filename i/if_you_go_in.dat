A story {{planned for}} the fourth series of The Sarah Jane Adventures, it would have seen many {{children}} avoiding a strange street next to Bannerman Road, called Sally Lane, after hearing an urban legand which states <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> the street, she will eat you alive. Sarah Jane and the gang investigate, and find a twelve-year-old girl, who was trapped in the street for years by an evil spirit, called the 'Trickster's Triangle'.|$|E

"And {{which would}} you rather do," [...] asked Mr. George, [...] "go {{in the morning or}} in the evening? <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> the morning coach, you will have to set out very early, before it is light, and then stay at Civita Vecchia, in a strange hotel, alone, all night. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> the evening, you can remain here, where you are acquainted, all day; but then you will have to ride alone in the night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now,' {{said the}} sergeant, in a subdued voice, 'I'll loosen the knot, {{and he can}} work himself free, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in,</b> Missis.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Any {{of these}} things may be true," [...] replied Jellia Jamb, [...] "so I haven't dared disturb our royal mistress. You, however, are a privileged character, Princess, and I am sure that Ozma wouldn't mind at all <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> to see her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You'll {{never see}} that time, nor any other, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> out <b>in</b> those thin boots. I'll fetch Sarah's clogs; I suppose {{you have not}} a {{reasonable}} pair in the world.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Celia, Celia, {{you will}} drive me mad <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> on <b>in</b> this way! The girl has told me, over and over, that she wishes him dismissed. Why {{do you think}} she doesn't?" ...|$|R
6000|$|DOCTOR. Wait {{till she}} sends {{for you at}} least--at least. Man alive, he'll kill you <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> there! What are you bothering him for? ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Ah well, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> {{for pure}} nature, {{as you were}} saying, there’s nothing like that. Nature, over here, must be awfully grand.” And Lord Lambeth looked about him.|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> for shades {{you must}} also go in for names. You must distinguish," [...] Nick objected. [...] "The observer's nothing without his categories, his types and varieties." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And look here, Dick," [...] {{she went}} on, [...] "I know how impetuous you are. Don't do {{anything}} foolish. Remember this isn't an ordinary adventure. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> rushing <b>in</b> upon it you'll come to grief." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here!" [...] I ses, [...] "you clear off. All of you. ’Ow {{dare you}} come on to my wharf? <b>If</b> <b>you</b> aren’t <b>gone</b> <b>in</b> two minutes I’ll give you all in charge." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'I wish he had,' said Nidderdale, 'with all my heart. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> you'll {{find him}} sitting there {{as large as}} life. He has been talking to me as though {{everything}} were all right.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> for the public's knowing {{differences}} you're far too particular," [...] Nick laughed. [...] "D'où tombez-vous? as you affected French people say. If you've {{anything at}} stake on {{that you had}} simply better not play." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Whopper, {{you know}} better than to go in that way," [...] remonstrated Snap. [...] "Wet your face and then go in head first---it's the only right way. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> by inches you'll gasp fit to turn your liver over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am sure {{it would}} make her very unhappy <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> off <b>in</b> magnanimous silence to the Land's End; and {{remaining}} as the boy's tutor, without confession, would be a mere delusion and treachery towards my aunt.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "We do have {{an erosion}} of {{confidence}} and I think <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> back <b>in</b> history every bubble has basically led to abuses, to fraud, to unethical behaviour and we’re seeing the same."-in an interview with Swissinfo, November 7, 2002 ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Far be {{it from me}} to say she is not {{exemplary}} in {{her perfect}} civility to all her husband's relations. Ada thinks her charming; but oh. Lily, you've never found {{out what it is}} to be a little person in a great person's house, and to feel one's self scrupulously made one of the family, because her husband is so much attached to all of them. There's nothing spontaneous about it! I dare say you would get on better, though You are not a country-town old maid; you would have an air of the world and of distinction even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> your old grey poplin.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A pretty safe {{adventure}} for YOU," [...] {{said the}} girl scornfully. [...] "YOU didn’t risk much. Look here, I like brave men. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> the cage and undo that bear, I’ll marry you. That’s what I call an adventure." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would leave}} to-morrow, only I cannot {{afford to be}} out of work, and times are {{somewhat}} dull. But, about your proposed venture. You will need sixty dollars more to hold an equal share <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in,</b> won't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mr Jackson. My name is Waller. I {{have been}} in the City some time, but I can still recall my first day. But one shakes down. One shakes down quite quickly. Here is the manager's room. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in,</b> he will tell you what to do.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well have to climb, but we won't {{fall down}} between any o' the rocks," [...] he said. [...] "It's {{dangerous}} walking over rocks with snow on 'em, for <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> down <b>in</b> a hollow you're liable to twist an ankle or break a leg." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> on <b>in</b> {{that way}} about your part, I shall {{think you want to}} play Mr. Gabblewig. Your rôle, though a small one on the stage, is a large one off it; and no man is more {{important}} to the Guild, both on and off.|$|R
5000|$|Joe Torres: [...] "Yeah? Well, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>go</b> back <b>in,</b> {{something}} worse {{will happen to}} you. You'll be fired." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sahib, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> {{the baggage}} train {{you might be}} miles away, and see nothing of it. Now, {{it seems to me}} that it would be almost as easy for you to go as a soldier in the regiment, as in the {{transport}} train." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No,--on the contrary. You must be {{prepared}} to spend something at the beginning. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> a pinch-and-scrape fashion in the beginning, you will get nowhere at all. Ten pounds a month! Why it's impossible! Ten pounds a month! But how am I to live?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Because, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> at {{different}} times, {{you will be}} in one another’s way. One will be going out when the other is coming in, and so you will interfere with one another. Then, besides, if you fill the wheelbarrows together, and wheel together, you will always be in company,--which is pleasanter.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} won't," [...] said Mrs. Tappitt. [...] "Oh dear, oh dear, T.! <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> on <b>in</b> this way we shall all be ruined; {{and then people}} will {{say that it was}} my fault, and that I ought to have had you inquired into about your senses." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{looked so}} undaunted that Charlie {{was a little}} nettled and fired his last shot rather recklessly: [...] "Well, one thing I do know you'll never get a husband <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> on <b>in</b> this absurd way, and by Jove! you need one {{to take care of}} you and keep the {{property}} together!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{have been}} told that he might pull through it, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> didn't <b>go</b> <b>in</b> to win, Wide-Awake; have you?' said Fledgeby. 'And it's not your game that he should pull through it; ain't it? You having got security, and there being enough to pay you? Oh, you Jew!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{here we are}} at the fort. I {{guess we}} may as well make our camp outside. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> you have got to picket your horse here and put your baggage there and come in at gun-fire, and all sorts of things that {{troubles}} a man who is accustomed to act as he likes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's the thing," [...] said Cecil. [...] "I mean it {{fast enough}} at home, {{and when my}} mother talks to me and I look at my brothers' graves, but it all gets swept away at Eton. It won't now, though, if you are different, Brownlow. I never liked any fellow like you I knew you were best, even when you were worst. So <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> for doing right, I shan't care for anyone else—-not even Cressham and Bulford." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{when you}} come to think that some policemen in New York take tribute from peddlers who obstruct the traffic, tradesmen who obstruct the sidewalk, {{restaurant}} keepers who keep open after one o'clock in the morning, drivers who exceed speed limits, and keepers of pool rooms, you'll understand that there's a good bit to be made out of graft, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> for it seriously. It's uncommonly lucky, McEachern, that you were left that money. Otherwise you might have been tempted, mightn't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can't you {{see that}} it would be fifty to one <b>if</b> <b>you</b> should <b>go</b> <b>in</b> that crowd? We couldn't help him, and what's the use of gettin' a big lickin' for nothing? Besides, what would become of your {{business}} if the people here thought you were his partner?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The tower or its {{interior}} {{has been seen}} in the films Prizzi's Honor, Catch Me <b>if</b> <b>You</b> Can, <b>Going</b> <b>in</b> Style (2017), the music video [...] "Empire State of Mind", and the TV shows Pan Am, Law & Order, Bored to Death, White Collar, Gossip Girl, and Boardwalk Empire.|$|R
6000|$|... "So I would. Now {{come and}} ask Mr. Bhaer <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can't <b>go</b> <b>in</b> town {{with me on}} Monday afternoon, {{so you can get}} the net, while I get the microscope. Franz and Emil are going too, and we'll have a jolly time larking round among the shops." ...|$|R
