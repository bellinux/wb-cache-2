Grates with long narrow slots parallel to traffic flow are of particular concern to cyclists, as the front tire of a bicycle may become stuck, causing the cyclist to go over the handlebars or lose control and fall. Storm drains in streets and parking areas must be strong enough to support the weight of vehicles, and are often made of cast iron or reinforced concrete.|$|R

Escapement of fish like cod, haddock, redfish and Greenland halibut is better than with any bycatch device tested earlier. Handling cause no significant problems, neither on small nor larger shrimp trawlers. Loss of shrimp when using the system is acceptable, less than 5 %.

40|$|Abstract. The as-cast {{structure}} of <b>grate</b> <b>bar</b> used in sintering trolley is primarily comprised of austenite and eutectic (eutectic austenite and eutectic carbide). The austenite is dendrite, while the carbide is reticular and chrysanthemum-like. The <b>grate</b> <b>bars</b> were {{quenched and tempered}} under various temperature (one set of samples: quenching (975 ~ 1050 °C); the other: quenching (1000 °C) + tempering (240 ~ 600 °C)). With rise in quenching temperature, the content of martensite increases and gradually stabilizes, and the hardness increases and then decreases (the maximum is 61. 5 HRC). For the tempered simple, the strip-like carbides gradually become smaller, shorter and homogenized; the resistance to temper softening is high and the maximum hardness is 58 HRC; the wear resistance gradually decreases and is {{lower than that of}} as-cast one when the temperature is higher than 480 °C.

40|$|Abstract: Applying various {{conventional}} and modern monitoring methods a function control of downstream migration facilities and turbine passage related mortality {{was conducted at}} the Kostheim Hydro Plant (4, 9 MW; two Kaplan turbines; Δh max. 3, 74 m, at MQ 2, 36 m) at the river Main (km 3, 2). Furthermore, the perceptibility and passability of a nature-like bypass for upstream migration was examined. Results showed a size selectivity of the bypass caused by an unsuitable entrance position 40 m downstream of the outlet of the turbines. The effectiveness of the downstream migration facilities proved to be low, leading to high mortalities at the trashrack and during turbine passage. The vertical bar trashrack with a <b>bar</b> <b>spacing</b> of 20 <b>mm</b> showed little repellent effect and was passed by most fish up to a size of 20 - 25 cm total length, causing scale loss and haematoma in Atlantic salmon smolts and cyprinid species.

40|$|The Mediterranean fishery has {{experienced}} a decline in catches over the past 20 years due to an excessive increase in effort caused by both increased trawler engine power and rapid technological advances in fishing technology and fish location. This has led to overexploitation, in which immature individuals support an increasing portion of the catches. The present study was undertaken to test a sorting grid and square-mesh-panel as juvenile exclusion systems. Our experience was a pilot study of such a system in the western Mediterranean. The purpose of these exclusion systems was to help juvenile hake escape from the net. The results demonstrate {{that the use of}} sorting grids for small fish in trawl gears in the Mediterranean is an efficient and practical means of avoiding the capture and discarding of unwanted individuals, with escape rates of over 50 % (ranging between 50 and 90 %). The grids were efficient and useful for excluding hake (Merluccius merluccius) on bottoms located at depths between 50 and 300 m, where hake are found all year round. A <b>bar</b> <b>spacing</b> of 20 <b>mm</b> yielded escape rates of L 50 at 18. 8 cm TL (L 25 = 16. 8 cm and L 75 = 20. 9 cm). Panels made of square meshes achieved poorer results than the grids.

In this study the contribution of mesh reinforcement to {{impact resistance}} and itseffect on the nature of local damage caused by impact of non-deformable projectiles are investigated. The investigation included a combination of 53 experiments and series of finite-element based numerical simulations. Three levels of local damage modes were investegated based on the severity of the degree of damage in the impacted panels. Mesh reinforcement ratio within the range of reinforcement ratio considered, namely 0. 19 % to 0. 48 %, was irrelevant to the impact behavior of RC panels under different impact velocities, while <b>bar</b> <b>spacing</b> was to be a controlling parameter for the degree of damage. RC panels reinforced with <b>bar</b> <b>spacing</b> greater than 1. 5 times the panel thickness have a tendency to spall concrete from the back face more than RC panels with closely <b>spaced</b> <b>bars.</b> RC panels reinforced with <b>bar</b> <b>spacing</b> greater than 1. 5 time the panel thickness formed punching shear crater, while panels reinforced with less than that limit distributed the damage over a wider area without forming the punching shear crater on the back face. Orthogonal mesh reinforcement with <b>bars</b> <b>spaced</b> no wider than one-third of the projectile diameter were able to prevent the projectiles from perforating the panels.

Alternate hauls {{were used to assess}} the selectivity of 36 -mm square-mesh codend. Selectivity of sorting grids was assessed using a double codend in which fish that escaped through the grid were captured in the lower codend while other fish were guided into the upper codend. The mean selection length (L 50) for European hake was 18. 5 cm and that for the Atlantic horse mackerel was 14. 0 cm with the 36 -mm square-mesh codend. These values are close to their current minimum landing sizes (20 cm for hake and 12 cm for horse mackerel). The sorting grid with 20 -mm <b>bar</b> <b>spacing</b> showed L 50 value of 13. 3 cm for hake, suggesting that a larger grid-spacing would be needed to obtain sufficient sorting performance. Similarly, for Atlantic mackerel the estimated L 50 of 14. 3 cm indicates that larger grid spacing is required to attain an L 50 that would be close to the current MLS (18 cm). For Atlantic horse mackerel and red mullet, the L 50 obtained with the sorting grid with 20 -mm <b>bar</b> <b>spacing</b> was close to the MLS of these species (the MLS of red mullet is 11 cm).
