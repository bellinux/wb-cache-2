5|$|Conceived by series creators Michael Schur and Greg Daniels, Ron {{has been}} a central {{character}} since the pilot episode of Parks and Recreation. Offerman had some input into the character's creation, and some aspects of Ron's personality were inspired by the actor, like his affinity <b>for</b> <b>woodworking</b> and 16-year-old Lagavulin Single Malt Scotch. The traits of the character were also partially inspired by a real-life Libertarian elected official in Burbank, California.|$|E
5|$|The {{first section}} of Treblinka II (Camp 1) was the Wohnlager {{administrative}} and residential compound; it had a telephone line. The main road within the camp was paved and named Seidel Straße after Unterscharführer Kurt Seidel, the SS corporal who supervised its construction. A few side roads were lined with gravel. The main gate for road traffic was erected on the north side. Barracks were built with supplies delivered from Warsaw, Sokołów Podlaski, and Kosów Lacki. There was a kitchen, a bakery, and dining rooms; all were equipped with high-quality items taken from Jewish ghettos. The Germans and Ukrainians each had their own sleeping quarters, positioned at an angle for better control of all entrances. There were also two barracks behind an inner fence for the Jewish work commandos. SS-Untersturmführer Kurt Franz set up a small zoo in the centre next to his horse stables, with two foxes, two peacocks and a roe deer (brought in 1943). Smaller rooms were built as laundry, tailors, and cobblers, and <b>for</b> <b>woodworking</b> and medical aid. Closest to the SS quarters were separate barracks for the Polish and Ukrainian serving, cleaning and kitchen women.|$|E

25|$|There is {{significant}} evidence of advanced woodworking in ancient Egypt. Woodworking {{is depicted in}} many extant ancient Egyptian drawings, and {{a considerable amount of}} ancient Egyptian furniture (such as stools, chairs, tables, beds, chests) has been preserved. Tombs represent a large collection of these artefacts and the inner coffins found in the tombs were also made of wood. The metal used by the Egyptians <b>for</b> <b>woodworking</b> tools was originally copper and eventually, after 2000 BC bronze as ironworking was unknown until much later.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} nine, Brâncuși {{left the}} village {{to work in the}} nearest large town. At 11 he went into the service of a grocer in Slatina; and then he became a {{domestic}} in a public house in Craiova where he remained for several years. When he was 18, Brâncuși created a violin by hand with materials he found around his workplace. Impressed by Brâncuși's talent for carving, an industrialist entered him in the Craiova School of Arts and Crafts (școala de arte și meserii), where he pursued his love <b>for</b> <b>woodworking,</b> graduating with honors in 1898.|$|E
25|$|Wood burning: when wood is burned, it {{is usually}} best to dry it first. Damage from {{shrinkage}} {{is not a problem}} here, and the drying may proceed more rapidly than in the case of drying <b>for</b> <b>woodworking</b> purposes. Moisture affects the burning process, with unburnt hydrocarbons going up the chimney. If a 50% wet log is burnt at high temperature, with good heat extraction from the exhaust gas leading to a 100°C exhaust temperature, about 5% of the energy of the log is wasted through evaporating and heating the water vapour. With condensers, the efficiency can be further increased; but, for the normal stove, the key to burning wet wood is to burn it very hot, perhaps starting fire with dry wood.|$|E

500|$|A concern {{around the}} turn of the 20th century was that many {{woodworking}} facilities in Indiana would be forced to close due to dwindling timber supplies. [...] This wood was used by furniture makers and shipbuilders such as the Howard Shipyards. The timber industry was a major part of southern Indiana's agricultural income, but thousands of acres had been deforested. In response to the problem, the state of Indiana decided to establish a series of state forests to ensure the continued existence of timber <b>for</b> <b>woodworking</b> facilities, and to allow Indiana to maintain its ability to export hardwood. The Indiana General Assembly in1901 created the Indiana State Board of Forestry.|$|E

2500|$|In 1953, {{researchers}} from the University of Chicago recommended that the school begin planning to expand, and school district officials began examining the purchase of land for a new school. [...] By 1955, the school population had grown to over 3,400 students, with an estimated increase to over 6,500 students by 1956. [...] In June 1955, the board accepted a recommendation to purchase a 60 acre site {{in the town of}} Hillside, and planned a bond issue for the autumn. [...] Even with the plans for a new school moving forward, the district also approved an expansion of Proviso: [...] a new gymnasium for young women, new music rooms, and new facilities <b>for</b> <b>woodworking</b> classes. [...] In November, the bond issue was approved by a 5900-626 vote. [...] 1957, the last year Proviso would be the only school in the district, the student population topped out at over 4,800 students. [...] With the new school determined to be Proviso West, the board of education voted to officially change the school's name to Proviso East, effective July 1, 1958.|$|E
2500|$|For example, at 150 deg F, {{using the}} Arden Buck equation, the {{saturation}} vapor pressure {{of water is}} found to be about 192 mmHg. The time constant for drying a [...] red oak board at 150 deg F is then [...] days, which is the time required to reduce the moisture content to 1/e = 37% of its initial deviation from equilibrium. If the relative humidity is 0.50, then using the Hailwood-Horrobin equation the moisture content of the wood at equilibrium is about 7.4%. The time to reduce the lumber from 85% moisture content to 25% moisture content is then about 4.5 days. [...] Higher temperatures will yield faster drying times, but they will also create greater stresses in the wood due because the moisture gradient will be larger. For firewood, this is not an issue but <b>for</b> <b>woodworking</b> purposes, high stresses will cause the wood to crack and be unusable. Normal drying times to obtain minimal seasoning checks (cracks) in 25mm (1 inch or 4/4 lumber) Red Oak ranges from 22 to 30 days, and in 8/4, (50mm or 2 inch) it will range from 65 to 90 days.|$|E
