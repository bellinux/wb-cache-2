5|$|During their U.S. tours, the Beatles were {{introduced}} to both Elvis Presley and Bob Dylan. Strongly influenced by Presley since before their formation, the band had tried to meet him in the past, but arrangements had fallen through. At Presley's suggestion, guitars were set up <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>living</b> room and the gathering played music for an hour, following which they discussed the music business and exchanged anecdotes. The other meeting, with Dylan, influenced the music subsequently produced by the Beatles as well as shaping Dylan's own musical style. This was made evident both in Dylan's controversial adoption of electric guitar, and in changes that were apparent in Lennon's vocal and guitar-playing styles.|$|E

McLean, who was the first to {{audition}} for Pearlman <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>living</b> room, became the group's first member. In January 1993, Pearlman held an open casting call and hundreds of young performers auditioned at his blimp hangar in Kissimmee. Eventually, Carter, Dorough, and Richardson were selected after meeting Pearlman's expectations. Littrell flew from Kentucky to Orlando to formally join the group on April 20, 1993, a day after receiving a phone call from Richardson about it. Thus, April 20 became their anniversary date. Pearlman decided to call them Backstreet Boys, after Orlando's Backstreet Market, an outdoor flea market near International Drive which was also a teen hangout.|$|E

25|$|Other studio {{sessions}} {{took place}} with Akon, while new writing sessions were planned with season eight American Idol runner-up Adam Lambert. No songs from either Akon or Lambert {{appear on the}} US track listing. In September 2010 it was also confirmed that Stewart's fellow songwriting and production partner, The-Dream, had joined his studio sessions with Rowland. Rap-Up reported that The-Dream had been staying in New York City where he was penning songs for Rowland to record. Then on September 5, 2010 songwriter and producer Jermaine Dupri, revealed <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>Living</b> the Life series {{that he was in}} the studio with Rowland recording material for the album. In the second of these videos, songwriter Bryan-Michael Cox was also present during sessions with Rowland and Dupri. It was later revealed that the opportunity and desire to schedule more recording sessions with the duo led to the album's pushback into 2011. None of the tracks with Dupri, Cox or The-Dream made the album. In January 2011, during a trip to London, it was revealed that Gucci Mane, Lil Wayne and Rick Ross would all appear on the album. Although by the time the track listing was revealed, only Wayne's song features while rappers Mane and Ross were replaced with new songs, respectively featuring Big Sean, Lil Playy and Love.|$|E

Their contemporaries included bands such as The Von Bondies, The Dirtbombs, The Detroit Cobras, and other bands that Jack included on a compilation album called Sympathetic Sounds of Detroit, which was recorded <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>living</b> room.|$|E

Roy's obsession with an idea implanted by an alien intelligence, his construction of the model, and his gradual loss of contact with his wife, mimic the events in the short story [...] "Dulcie and Decorum" [...] (1955) by Damon Knight.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode is}} {{presented}} as {{an excerpt from the}} video diary of Elton Pope (Marc Warren), a young man who is describing his encounters with the Doctor. [...] Elton's on-camera narration forms a present-day frame story to a series of flashbacks related to the Doctor. Elton recalls a chance meeting with the Doctor and remembers having seen the same man as a child <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>living</b> room one night. On the internet he discovers others, including Ursula Blake (Shirley Henderson), who have also reported similar experiences with the Doctor. Elton and Ursula form a group known as LINDA, the [...] "London Investigation [...] 'N' [...] Detective Agency". They are joined by three other people: Bridget (Moya Brady), Bliss (Kathryn Drysdale), and Mr Skinner (Simon Greenall). LINDA meets in a library basement to discuss their experiences, but soon their meetings become more social in nature.|$|E
500|$|The party {{recruited}} star candidates, including Calgary alderman George Ho Lem {{and former}} Calgary Stampeder star Don Luzzi (Edmonton alderman and future mayor Cec Purves {{was defeated in}} his bid to win the Social Credit nomination in Edmonton-Strathcona from Strathcona Centre incumbent Joseph Donovan Ross), but was handicapped in these efforts by Strom's unwillingness to offer cabinet posts or other incentives to potential new candidates. [...] Strom's lack of personal charisma was also a liability: tellingly, of the large budget recommended by the central committee, only $72,000 was recommended for use on television advertising, where Strom did not shine. [...] The party tried to revitalize the Premier's image through publicity movies, though efforts were mixed. [...] In one, which was pulled after a single showing, Strom appeared scowling <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>living</b> room, urging Albertans to lower their expectations of government. [...] Another, produced by Tommy Banks and showing Strom {{in a variety of}} settings talking about the province's changing face, was more successful.|$|E

500|$|Wilberforce was a small, sickly and {{delicate}} child, with poor eyesight. In 1767 he began attending Hull Grammar School, {{at the time}} headed by a young, dynamic headmaster, Joseph Milner, who {{was to become a}} lifelong friend. Wilberforce profited from the supportive atmosphere at the school until {{the death of his father}} in 1768 caused changes <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>living</b> arrangements. With his mother struggling to cope, the nine-year-old Wilberforce was sent to a prosperous uncle and aunt with houses in both St James' Place, London, and Wimbledon, at that time a village [...] south-west of London. He attended an [...] "indifferent" [...] boarding school in Putney for two years. He spent his holidays in Wimbledon, where he grew extremely fond of his relatives.

500|$|In 1994, Conran {{set up a}} bluescreen <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>living</b> {{room and}} began {{assembling}} the tools {{he would need to}} create his movie. He was not interested in working his way through the system and instead wanted to follow the route of independent filmmakers like Steven Soderbergh. Initially, Kerry and his brother had nothing more than [...] "just a vague idea of this guy who flew a plane. We would talk about all the obvious things like Indiana Jones and all the stuff we liked." [...] Conran spent four years making a black and white teaser trailer in the style of an old-fashioned movie serial on his Macintosh IIci personal computer. Once he was finished, Conran showed it to producer Marsha Oglesby, who was a friend of his brother's wife and she recommended that he let producer Jon Avnet see it. Conran met Avnet and showed him the trailer. Conran told him that he wanted to make it into a movie. They spent two or three days just talking about the tone of the movie.|$|E
500|$|Back in Los Angeles, Beck {{began to}} work at a video store in Silver Lake [...] "doing things like {{alphabetizing}} the pornography section". He began performing in arthouse clubs and coffeehouses such as Al's Bar and Raji's. In order to keep indifferent audiences engaged in his music, Beck would play in a spontaneous, joking manner. [...] "I'd be banging away on a Son House tune and the whole audience would be talking. So maybe out of desperation or boredom, or the audience's boredom, I'd make up these ridiculous songs just to see if people were listening," [...] he later remarked. Virtually an unknown to the public and an enigma to those who met him, Beck would hop onstage between acts in local clubs and play [...] "strange folk songs", accompanied by [...] "what could best be described as performance art" [...] while sometimes wearing a Star Wars stormtrooper mask. Beck met someone who offered to help record demos <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>living</b> room, and he began to pass cassette tapes around.|$|E
