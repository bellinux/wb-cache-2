40|$|<b>Hyperthyreosis,</b> {{diabetes}} and calcium disorders are frequent endocrine diseases {{that are often}} encountered by the primary care physician. The diagnosis of <b>hyperthyreosis</b> can be established by many different laboratory and analytical tests. However, the clinical context can often guide a specific diagnostic approach. Graves disease and toxic adenomas are the most frequent causes of <b>hyperthyreosis.</b> Diagnosis of Graves disease is most frequent between age 35 and 60 and about 10 - 20 % of patients show already initially signs of endocrine orbithopathy. Measurement of thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins (TSI) is especially valuable in unclear cases. Toxic adenomas are always diagnosed by thyroid uptake studies. Rare causes of <b>hyperthyreosis</b> include thyreoiditis, which is characterized by transient <b>hyperthyreosis</b> (< 2 months), and thyrotoxicosis factitia. Here, we discuss diagnosis and therapy of different causes of <b>hyperthyreosis</b> based on three clinical examples...|$|E
40|$|Bacground/Aim. Increased {{values of}} thyroid hormones in the {{clinical}} syndrome of <b>hyperthyreosis</b> affect blood pressure values and its circadial variation. The {{aim of this study}} was to define the influence of <b>hyperthyreosis</b> on the values and circadial variations of arterial blood pressure, as well as to investigate the effect of thyroid surgery on blood pressure values. Methods. We compared the 24 -hour averages of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, their variations and their reduction during the night between 20 female patients with hyperthyroidism and hypertension de novo and 20 healthy females. We compared the values of 24 -hour ambulatory monitoring performed before the surgery with the values gathered two weeks after the surgery. Results. The 24 -hour average systolic and diastolic blood pressure values were higher in the patients with hyperthyroidism than in the control group (p < 0. 001). In the group of patients, the variations in blood pressure were significantly higher than they were in the group of healthy people (p < 0. 001). The amplitude of the nocturnal reduction of blood pressure was also significantly lower in the patients with hyperthyroid status and hypertension, in comparison to the healthy persons (p < 0. 001). Two weeks after the surgery, a significant reduction of blood pressure values (both for systolic and diastolic) appeared. Conclusion. The patients with hyperthyroidism- caused hypertension had higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure, higher variations in blood pressure and lower nocturnal reduction of blood pressure than healthy subjects. Thyroid surgery, as a control of thyroid function, optimised blood pressure very rapidly...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>hyperthyreosis</b> on oxidative stress, state of glial intermediate filaments and memotry was investigated. Significant increasing of lipid peroxidation products into both hippocampus and cortex and {{change for the}} worse of memory was observed. Analysis of the behavioral reactions of rats in the test of passive avoidance conditioned reflex showed that the acquisition of skills of all groups of animals did not differ by time waiting period (latent period). Time saving memory test conditioned reflex of passive avoidance was excellent {{in the group of}} rats treated with thyroxine compared with controls. The change of polypeptide GFAP was observed in hippocampus and cortex. Both soluble and filamentous forms of GFAP increased in hippocampus of rat with <b>hyperthyreosis.</b> In filament fractions, increase in the intensity of 49 kDa polypeptide band was found. In the same fraction of insoluble cytoskeleton proteins degraded HFKB polypeptides with molecular weight in the region of 46 – 41 kDa appeared. Marked increase of degraded polypeptides was found in the soluble fraction of the brain stem. The intensity of the intact polypeptide (49 kDa), {{as well as in the}} filament fraction, significantly increased. It is possible that increasing concentrations of soluble subunits glial filaments may be due to dissociation of own filaments during the reorganization of cytoskeleton structures. Given the results of Western blotting for filament fraction, increased content of soluble intact 49 kDa polypeptide is primarily the result of increased expression of HFKB and only partly due to redistribution of existing filament structures. Calculation and analysis of indicators showed high correlation between the increase in content and peroxidation products of HFKB. These results indicate the important role of oxidative stress in the induction of astroglial reactive response under conditions of hyperthyroidism. This data shows the possibility of the glial cell cytoskeleton reconstruction under effect of thyroid hormones...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background EMO syndrome, {{defined as}} a triad {{including}} exophthalmus, pretibial myxedema and osteoarthropathia, is a rare condition in patients suffering from <b>hyperthyreosis.</b> Case presentation We here describe an interesting case of EMO syndrome associated with unilateral fibromatosis of the hand and an initial stage of generalized myxedema of the skin. To our knowledge a similar case {{has not yet been}} described in literature though reports about associated fibromatosis, e. g. located retroperitoneally, already exist. Familiar explanations include its initiation by autoimmune processes or aberrant T-cell cytokine stimulation leading to an overwhelming production of glycosaminoglycans. Conclusion Interpreting our case in context with previous reports we conclude that associated fibromatosis induced by autoimmune processes may affect a variety of different localizations and therefore requires careful monitoring. A therapeutical attempt by using UVA 1 irridation for pretibial myxedema remained without a satisfying regression. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction There {{is little}} {{information}} {{about the risk of}} HCV recurrence in immunosuppressed patients. Although the presence of antibodies to HCV and the absence of HCV-RNA is usually considered to indicate viral elimination, the virus may not be completely eliminated but may be under control of an effective immune response. Case presentation A 69 year old man presented with jaundice, elevated ALT, AST, lipase and concomitant abdominal pain. He was found to be positive for HCV-RNA (genotype 3 a) and was diagnosed with acute hepatitis C. Six weeks later no HCV-RNA was detected, and the patient was diagnosed with <b>hyperthyreosis</b> and started on propylthiouracil. After 4 weeks of propylthiouracil treatment, the patient developed leucocytopenia, followed by liver function deterioration and reappearance of HCV-RNA. Propylthiouracil was discontinued and his leukocyte counts increased. Twenty-eight weeks after onset of acute hepatitis C, no HCV-RNA was detected. Conclusion This case history shows the risk of recurrence of HCV during leucocytopenia. These findings indicate that patients who are anti-HCV positive but HCV-RNA negative may be at risk of cytopenia-induced HCV reactivation. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to determine whether}} any causal relationship exists between thyroid gland diseases and frequent and repeated inflammations of upper respiratory pathways, and whether taking hormonal contraception or tonsilectomy undergone in an early age may exert any influence the incidence of thyroid gland diseases. In this study, anonymous answers of 364 patients at the endocrinological outpatient department with various durations of thyreopathy treatment were collected. A questionnaire with open and closed questions was used as the form of the study, and the questionnaire was completed during personal interviews. Common medical division of thyroid gland diseases was respected when processing the results, i. e. division to euthyreosis, inflammation, hypothyreosis, <b>hyperthyreosis,</b> tumour, and surgery in the past. In general population, 17. 8 % of persons older than 15 years of age suffer from diseases of upper respiratory pathways. 35. 7 % of the questioned patients reported that they repeatedly suffered from diseases of upper respiratory pathways. It is thus apparent that those suffering from a thyroid gland disorder show a double rate of any disease of upper respiratory pathways than those showing relative health. Preliminary results of the survey suggest a significant influence of [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Prije 100 godina japanski liječnik Hakaru Hashimoto opisao je 4 bolesnika s kroničnom bolešću štitnjače u čijem su patohistološkom nalazu navedeni limfocitna infiltracija, fibroza, atrofija parenhima te eozinofilne promjene nekih acinarnih stanica. Radi se o godinama poznatoj bolesti čija je patofiziologija u tančine opisana, a koja i dalje često iznenađuje raznolikim kliničkim slikama. Prepoznato je niz antigena štitnjače na koje su usmjerena tireoidna antitijela (TSH, tireoglobulin, tireoperoksidaza), te je dokazano da je tireocit ujedno stanica koja prezentira antigen. etiološki se navode genetski i okolišni čimbenici. Genetski čimbenici utječu sa 80 % na pojavu autoimunosti (HLA i ne-HLA geni), a okolišni (pušenje, jod, selen, onečišćenje, infektivna stanja, fizički i emocionalni stres) i fiziološka stanja (pubertet, rast, trudnoća, menopauza, starenje, ženski spol) sa 20 %. Prikazan je slučaj bolesnice s dugogodišnjom hipotireozom koja u postpartalnom razdoblju, uz komplikaciju septičkog endometritisa, razvila hipertireozu. Etiologija hipertireoze bila je nejasna uz tri moguća objašnjenja: reziduom placente produljena stimulacija β HCG-om, sepsom promijenjena specifičnost antitijela usmjerenih prema TSH receptoru ili izostanak imunosupresivnog učinka trudnoće. Odgovor je dala ponovna trudnoća koja je bila bez komplikacija, ali se postpartalna hipertireoza ponovila. Hashimotov tireoiditis pokazao je dva lica: dugotrajnu hipotireozu i postpartalni tireoiditis s hipertireozom. Introduction: In 1912 Japanese {{physician}} Hashimoto Hakaru described 4 {{patients with}} chronic thyroid disease. The histopathology findings exactly 100 years ago described lymphocyte infiltration, fibrosis, parenchymal atrophy and eosinophilic changes of some acinar cells. Those findings are typical for the autoimmune thyroid disease named by the author Hashimoto thyroiditis or lymphocytic thyroiditis. Hashimoto thyroiditis: The pathophysiology of thyroid autoimmunity during the past decades was described in details. Many thyroid antigens were identified (thyroid - stimulating hormone or TSH, thyroglobulin, thyreoperoxidase) and antibodies are directed towards them. Thyreocyte is also able to function as antigen presenting cell. It presents antigen on its surface and expresses MHC class II and class I molecules. Etiology of autoimmune thyroiditis combines genetic and environmental factors. Genetic factors dominate, and influence with about 80 % on the occurrence of immunity. Some HLA genes (HLADR 3, HLA-DR 4, HLA-DR 5 and HLA-DQA) and some non-HLA genes (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 -CTLA- 4, CD 40 gene, gene for protein tyrosine phosphatase 22 -PTPN 22, thyroglobulin and TSH gene) are involved. 20 % of etiology is attributed to environmental factors (smoking, iodine intake, selenium deficiency, pollution, infectious conditions, physical and emotional stress) and physiological states (puberty, rapid growth, pregnancy, menopause, aging, female gender). Although Hashimoto thyroiditis is known for many years, it is still sometimes presented with surprisingly diverse clinical entities and frequently astonishes many physicians. Case report: A case of a female patient with long-standing hypothesis (fine needle aspiration showed lymphocytic infiltration, thyreoperoxidase antibodies were positive) is presented. During the postpartum period, complicated with septic endometritis a new onset of <b>hyperthyreosis</b> appeared. The etiology of hyperthyroidism was unclear, with three possible explanations. The first one was that residual placental mass could cause prolonged exposure to Ŕ- HCG. β- HCG causes hyperthyroidism mimicking action of TSH. The second explanation was that sepsis changes the nature of antibodies directed to the TSH receptor – thyrotrophin binding inhibitory antibodies become thyroid stimulating antibodies. The last explanation pointed to the pregnancy as a trigger itself that influenced on the immune events. <b>Hyperthyreosis</b> was followed by hypothyreosis and substitution with previous dosage of levothyroxine was continued. The answer of the sudden <b>hyperthyreosis</b> was given in subsequent pregnancy that happened 2, 5 years later. The following one was free of complications, but postpartum hyperthyroidism occurred again. Further course of disease suited to lymphocytic thyroiditis with hypothyroidism, and she is substituted with levothyroxine until now. Discussion: During normal pregnancy {{it is expected to}} have decreased ratio of CD 4 + / CD 8 + lymphocyte subpopulation. Studies showed that women who developed postpartum thyroiditis had a higher ratio of CD 4 + / CD 8 + and they were generally anti-TPO positive. It is considered that the lack of the expected suppression of immune function during pregnancy leads to postpartum thyroiditis. In this case Hashimoto thyroiditis showed two different faces: it was presented with long term hypothyroidism, but in postpartum period it converted to hyperthyroidism. a typical picture of postpartum thyroiditis. Conclusion: Pregnancy as a trigger can reveal till then unrecognized autoimmune disorder, or modify its course from hypothyroidism to hyperthyroidism. Hashimoto disease even 100 years after the discovery may surprise with one of its many faces...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: {{to analyze}} iodine {{sufficiency}} and to evaluate thyroid structural and functional status in Novosibirsk citizens for the 1995 – 2010 periods. Methods and materials. Thyroid structural and functional status, {{as well as}} iodine deficiency, were evaluated in Novosibirsk population of adults and adolescents within the international projects MONIСA (1994 – 1995) and HAPIEE (2004 – 2005) and cross-sectional populational screening of random representative sample of school students. Results. In 1994 – 1995 iodine deficiency (mainly minor or moderate) was revealed at 83 % of adult Novosibirsk citizens at age 25 – 34. Median urinary iodine concentration was 47 μg/l. In adolescent population subclinical hypothyreosis was initially revealed in 1, 5 %. Another 1, 5 % of adolescents had initially diagnosed subclinical <b>hyperthyreosis.</b> In 2005 median urinary iodine concentration in adult (45 – 69 years old) was 107 μg/l. Among all urine samples median urinary iodine concentration of more than 100 μg/l (100 – 360 μg/l) was revealed in 54 %, 13 % had median urinary iodine concentration less than 50 μg/l. During the period 2009 – 2010 median urinary iodine concentration in adolescents (14 – 17 years old) was 93 μg/l. Among all urine samples median urinary iodine concentration of more than 100 μg/l (100 – 360 μg/l) was revealed in 39 %, 7 % had median urinary iodine concentration less than 50 μg/l. According to the above mentioned results mass iodine deficiency preventive actions lead to the increase of urinary iodine concentration in Siberian. However to the moment iodine deficiency in Novosibirsk is still exists. Persistent community oriented measures are necessary {{for the prevention of}} iodine deficiency...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine whether the {{antioxidant}} alpha-lipoic acid protects neurons from diabetic-reperfusion injury. The streptozotocin (STZ) rat model was used to study the glial reactivity and prevention of gliosis by alpha-lipoic acid (alpha-LA) administration. The expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was determined, as well as lipid peroxidation (LPO) and glu-tathione (GSH) levels in some brain tissues. We observed significant increasing of lipid peroxidation products in both hippocampus and cortex. Changesof polypeptide GFAP were observed in hippocampus and cortex. Both soluble and filamentous forms of GFAP featured the increase in hippocampus of rat with <b>hyperthyreosis.</b> In the filamentfractions, increase in the intensity of 49 kDa polypeptide band was found. In the same fraction of insoluble cytoskeleton proteins degraded HFKB polypeptides with molecular weight in the range of 46 – 41 kDa appeared. Markedincrease of degraded polypeptides was found in the soluble fraction of the brain stem. The intensity of the intact polypeptide – 49  kDa, as well as in the filament fraction, significantly increased. It is possible that increasing concentrations of soluble subunits glial filaments may be due to dissociation of own filaments during the reorganization of cytoskeleton structures. Given the results of Western blotting for filament fraction, increased content of soluble intact 49 kDa polypeptide is primarily the result of increased expression of HFKB and only partly due to redistribution of existing filament structures. Calculation and analysis of indicators showed high correlation between the increase in content and peroxidation products of HFKB. These results indicate the important role of oxidative stress in the induction of astroglial response under conditions of diabet encefalopathia. Administration of alpha-LA reduced the expression both of glial and neuronal markers. In addition, alpha-LA significantly prevented the increase in LPO levels found in diabetic rats. GSH levels increased by the administration of alpha-LA. This study suggests that alpha-LA prevents neural injury by inhibiting oxidative stress and suppressing reactive gliosis. All these changes were clearly counteracted by alpha-lipoic acid. The results of this study demonstrate that alpha-lipoic acid provides for protection to the GFAP, as a whole, from diabet -reperfusion injuries...|$|E
40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) is {{an independent}} factor for mortality and morbidity. One of the most debilitating consequences of the disease is the accompanying risk of stroke Unipolar temperature-guided (radio) high frequency ablation is performed during cardiac arrest, concomitant to other heart surgery procedures by patients with chronic AF. Saline ice slush and an isolation mat are placed in the transverse sinus. Using unipolar RF-energy from the Osypka HAT 300, linear lesions were created in the left atrium (LA) following the Berlin modification lesion set. A probe registers the temperature during the procedure. The LA appendage is occluded and by patients with very large LA a reduction plastic is performed. All patients who became an ablation procedure, between 01. April 2000 and 31. March 2005, were retrospectively examined. After complete follow up for all patients (mean 41. 5 +/- 14. 4 months), 72 % of the patients are in sinus rhythm or show a biatrial contraction with sequential pacemaker. Factors which positively affect the result are {{the presence of a}} Mitral valve stenosis and paroxysmal AF before the operation. The result is affected negatively by the presence of <b>Hyperthyreosis.</b> Patients with long existing VHF and patients, who received ablation through a transeptal approach show worse success rates. No influence on the success rates have the diameter of the left atrium, coronary heart disease, Aortic valve disease, Tricuspid valve insufficiency, Diabetes mellitus, pulmonary hypertension, age and sex. Patients with normal or reduced LV-EF and patients with high, middle or low risk profile (according to EuroSCORE) profit equally from the procedure. Serious complications related with the procedure did not occur and can be avoided without large expenditure. The direct view of the surgeon and the safety measures used are a sufficient prophylaxis {{for the protection of the}} neighbouring mediastinal structures. We registered a very high incidence of postoperative AF of approx. 70 %. Atrial fibrillation is mostly registered on the first and second post operative day. However AF, which arises on the operation day, is connected with a worse prognosis. The incidence of postoperative atrial flutter is about 3. 5 %. Up to the third postoperative month the postoperative atrial arrhythmias were terminated in 98 % of the patients, who were successfully treated. The ablation duration was approximately five minutes. The HAT 300 shows safety deficits with the tendency to Overshooting. A temperature of 65 ° C seems to be just as effective, as higher temperatures.

40|$|Background/Aims. Thyroid gland surgery {{today is}} not saddled with high {{incidence}} of main complications. Miscellaneous surgical institutions with different surgical approach, operative technique and radicality have published reports with great discrepancy in incidence of complications, analyzing them with different methods of diagnosis and result evaluation. In {{the same way it}} is well known that higher latitude of operative procedure gave better control of thyroid diseases, but it can be accompanied with more complications. All of that motivate us to analyze complications of operative treatment in our patients under well known criteria, with hypothesis that higher radicality of operative procedure do not increase incidence of complications, and that this incidence is in correlations with results published in world literature. Aim of this nonrandomized study was to analyze results of operative treatment for huge number of consecutively operated patients in our teaching hospital, to analyze and compare results according to group of diseases and operative procedures, and to compare final results with results published in the world literature. Methods. Complications of operative treatment were analyzed retrospectively for period 1988 - 1997 (Group I) and prospectively in period 1998 - 2002 (Group II). Operations were performed by 20 surgeons and 20 young surgeons during their education. We have analyzed only complications during first 30 days after operation. Results. In Group I there was 1425 patients with 1451 operations (192 thyroid malignances, 247 hyperthireosis, 98 reoperations, 13 % thyreoidectomies and 14, 8 % lobectomies), with complication rate of 14, 3 %. Most common complication was recurrent laryngeal nerve injury in 9, 3 % patients or 6, 3 % according to number of exposed nerves („nerve at risk“), then postoperative hypocalcemia with rate of 4, 7 % (persistent in 1, 3 %). In Group II in 675 patients there was 687 operations (96 thyroid malignances, 111 hyperthireosis, 35 reoperations, 36, 6 % thyreoidectomies and 25 % lobectomies), with complication rate of 10, 7 %. Most common postoperative complication was hypocalcemia with 5 % rate (persistent in 0, 7 %), then recurrent laryngeal nerve injury in 4, 4 % patients or 2, 9 % according to number of exposed nerves („nerve at risk“). Incidence of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury in Group II is less frequent than in Group I, highly statistically significant (p< 0, 01), while for other complications there is no statistically significant difference. Totally for both groups there was 0, 7 % tracheotomies, postoperative bleeding in 1, 1 % of patients, wound haemathoma in 0, 5 %, wound infections in 0, 9 %, pneumonia in 0, 5 %, mortality 0, 5 % and most common cause of death (8 / 11) was problem with respiration, „Airway obstruction“. In Group II complications were less frequent in total thyreoidectomies in relation to lobectomy with contra lateral subtotal lobectomy. In both groups and totally incidence of complications was higher in reoperations, in patients with more extensive operative procedure, in malignant diseases and <b>hyperthyreosis.</b> Conclusion. In thyroid gland surgery more extensive operative treatment with improved operative technique (micro dissection, recurrent laryngeal nerve visualization and parathyroid gland preservation), in our teaching hospital, do not have influence on incidence of postoperative complications, even recurrent laryngeal nerve injury was significantly less frequent. This results are in correlation with published results of similar hospitals around the world...|$|E
