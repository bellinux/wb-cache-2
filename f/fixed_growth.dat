50|$|In {{the context}} of {{monetary}} policy, one policy question is whether a central bank should attempt to achieve a <b>fixed</b> <b>growth</b> rate of the price level from its current level in each time period, or whether to target a return of the price level to a predetermined growth path.

In either case the price level has drift {{in the sense of}} a rising expected value, but the cases differ according to the type of non-stationarity: difference stationarity in the former case, but trend stationarity in the latter case.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPhoto-reactive {{epidermal}} {{growth factor}} (EGF) was synthesized by coupling EGF with azidobenzoic acid and was immobilized onto the wells of a polystyrene culture plate by photo-irradiation. The photo-immobilized EGF enhanced the growth of anchorage-dependent cells more than native or azidobenzoyl derivatized EGF. A small amount of photo-immobilized EGF was sufficient to enhance the growth of cells and the maximal mitogenic effect was {{greater than that of}} native or derivatized EGF. On the other hand, the photo-immobilized EGF did not enhance growth of anchorage-independent cells. In addition, signal transduction in the cells adhered only on the EGF-immobilized surface was observed by staining of phosphotyrosine residues by anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. These results showed that the enhanced cell growth was due to direct interaction between the cells and the immobilized EGF. Photo-immobilization could be a universal means of <b>fixing</b> <b>growth</b> factors onto an artificial matrix that is devoid of chemically functional groups scaffolding growth factors and could provide a new tool to elucidate signal transduction mechanism and could lead {{to the development of a}} new protein-free cell culture system or tissue engineering materials...|$|R
40|$|Existing {{research}} differentiates {{beliefs about}} success and intelligence into two categories: <b>fixed</b> and <b>growth</b> mindset. This popular categorical view aims {{to account for}} differences in performance, success and failure, but {{does not address the}} influences of task parameters. To better explain nuanced performance differences as a result of individual beliefs and task parameters, the current set of experiments proposes the Strategic Mindset Model as an alternative. This model posits that (1) fixed mindsets may be adaptive in some circumstances, (2) mindset interacts with task parameters to influence performance and (3) that mindset is malleable and can be influenced by experience. The experiments presented here provide evidence for all three tenets of the Strategic Mindset Model, suggesting that mindset may be a strategic choice that exists on a continuum, and that participants may select a degree of <b>fixed</b> or <b>growth</b> orientation dependent on task parameters and objectives. Results from these experiments call into question some of the assumptions made in Mindset Theory, and may be used in practice by educators, coaches, and researchers to elicit improved performance in the face of varying task parameters...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Sensitive growth grammars are {{systems of}} {{rewriting}} rules (extended Lindenmayer systems) with graphical interpretation and with &quot;sensitive functions&quot; {{designed to allow}} a feedback from the created virtual 3 -D structures to the subsequent rule-application process. Thus {{it is possible to}} combine morphological (genetically <b>fixed)</b> <b>growth</b> rules with environmental impact and with functions depending on the competitive situation of individuals in the framework of a precisely-specified model of plant growth. The dynamics of stand development in such models results from purely local rule application. Preliminary results are shown for three different applications in forest-ecosystem modelling: (a) Creation of irregular stand structures, (b) simulation of competitive effects on crown radius development and resulting stand dynamics, and (c) modelling the interaction between trees and herbivores, including the energy budgets of the individual plants and animals. The software system GROGRA, designed to interpret sensitive growth grammars, enables visualisation of the resulting spatial structures and provides analysis tools and data interfaces to other software. ...|$|E

Accordingly, the critical radius, critical energy change and surface energy can be interpreted in terms of cubic function, where it produced a critical surface energy γNS * and the corresponding r * and ∆G*, called a CRESE point at a <b>fixed</b> <b>growth</b> temperature T when solved mathematically. It is defined as a limiting point at which equilibrium of the critical parameters take place at a constant temperature. Experiments were performed on the samples of amorphous silicon nanodots fabricated onto different non-crystalline substrates. A further analysis on the γNS*-T plots revealed inverse linear relationships which converged at a CID point (γo*,T*) when projected near the solidification temperature of silicon. The results suggested strong influence of atomic bonding at the nucleus-surface interface combined with higher surface roughness. In conclusion, there exists an equilibrium condition among the growth parameters which stabilizes the growth of amorphous silicon nanodots, as well as the existence of CRESE’s ideal destination (CID) ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{explores the}} impact of {{implicit}} theories of intelligence held by academically able, male students on their levels of engagement with challenging tasks. In my workplace, an academy grammar school, levels of challenge in lessons were raised to engage and motivate students, and increase academic attainment. However, some students responded negatively to the challenging tasks and underachieved in assessments. Using the model of Implicit Theories of Intelligence Mind-Sets as a framework, {{the aim of this}} study was to elucidate students’ intrinsic beliefs, values and conceptualisations about challenge, effort and intelligence. This new knowledge was used to inform school policy and develop classroom practice that supports students to positively engage with challenge. An interpretivist methodology was adopted and case study design used to investigate the research question. Twenty-one Year Eleven students in a GCSE Biology class completed a questionnaire to assign them as <b>fixed</b> or <b>growth</b> mind-set theorists. The students’ learning behaviours were video-recorded during two consecutive Biology lessons whilst they completed a challenging problem-solving task. Six students (three <b>fixed</b> and three <b>growth</b> theorists) were selected for interview. During the video-stimulated, semi-structured interviews, students recalled their experiences working on the challenging task and related these to their conceptualisations of intelligence. A more diverse pattern of mind-sets, learning behaviours, goals and concepts of intelligence was found than is predicted by the model. Five students combined <b>fixed</b> and <b>growth</b> mind-set associated beliefs in their conceptualisations of intelligence. Within the boundaries of the case study, the findings did not support a causal relationship between mind-set and response to the challenging task.
