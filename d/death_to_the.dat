Saavedra and Funes did not like him, but with the social commotion generated by Alberti's death, they avoided to offer resistance to his nomination.|$|E

Legal and ethical aspects of the killing, such as his not being taken alive despite being unarmed, were questioned by others, including Amnesty International.

5|$|All stories {{starring}} Jon Pertwee as the Third Doctor are complete, {{though many}} episodes no longer survive on their original videotapes and were only available from black-and-white overseas prints upon recovery; these episodes have subsequently been restored to colour {{using a variety}} of methods.

The latter was recovered from overseas, initially from a tape in the NTSC format, and later in the original PAL format on a tape returned from Dubai.|$|E

5|$|Henry's {{succession}} {{plans were}} thrown into chaos by {{the sinking of}} the White Ship on 25 November 1120. Henry had left the port of Barfleur for England in the early evening, leaving William Adelin and many of the younger members of the court to follow on that night in a separate vessel, the White Ship. Both the crew and passengers were drunk and, just outside the harbour, the ship hit a submerged rock. The ship sank, killing as many as 300 people, with only one survivor, a butcher from Rouen. Henry's court was initially too scared to report William's <b>death</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> King. When he was finally told, he collapsed with grief.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of the morning of 17 December Milstein and Trassjonsky became {{increasingly}} concerned as Gardstein's condition worsened, and they sent for a local doctor, explaining that their patient had been wounded accidentally by a friend. The doctor thought the bullet was still in the chest—it was later found to be touching the right ventricle of the heart. The doctor wanted to take Gardstein to the London Hospital, but he refused; with no other course open to him, the doctor sold them pain medication and left. The Russian was dead by 9:00am that morning. The doctor returned at 11:00am and found the body. He had not heard of the events at Exchange Buildings the night before, and so reported the <b>death</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> coroner, not the police. At midday the coroner reported the <b>death</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> local police who, led by Divisional Detective Inspector Frederick Wensley, went to Grove Street and discovered the corpse. Trassjonsky was in the next room when they entered, and she was soon found by the police, hastily burning papers; she was arrested and taken to the police headquarters at Old Jewry. Many of the papers recovered linked the suspects to the East End, particularly to the anarchist groups active in the area. Wensley, who had extensive knowledge of the Whitechapel area, subsequently acted as a liaison officer to the City of London force throughout the investigation.|$|E
5|$|The {{first hint}} of his <b>death</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Soviet people came at 7:15 p.m. Moscow Time, when the usual {{television}} programs were altered and a pop music concert {{was replaced by a}} documentary on Vladimir Lenin. On Vremya, the Soviet Union's state television newscast, the hosts wore somber clothes instead of their normally informal dress code. At first, Soviet citizens believed it was Andrei Kirilenko who had died, as he had not been present at the 65th anniversary of the October Revolution a few days earlier (he died in 1990). Furthermore, other abrupt changes to the television line-up occurred, such as the appearance of an unscheduled program of war reminiscences and the replacement of an ice hockey game on Channel Two with Tchaikovsky's Pathétique symphony. Brezhnev's death was announced on 11 November simultaneously by Soviet radio and television hosts. The television announcement was read by Igor Kirillov with tears in his eyes at 11 a.m. Moscow Time.|$|E

5|$|The {{narrative}} of Miracle Day focuses on {{an event in}} which death ceases to occur across {{the world and the}} gravely-wounded continue to remain alive. On the first day of this phenomenon, the so-called Miracle Day, Oswald, a former schoolteacher who molested, raped, and murdered one of his students, survives his own execution. His survival draws global attention, and he subsequently is released from prison on a legal technicality. After being offered both exposure and protection by Public Relations expert Jilly Kitzinger (Lauren Ambrose), he becomes her client, which helps him gain more publicity. Following a series of events he ends up aiding Torchwood, a team composed of two former alien-hunters and two former CIA agents, on their mission to restore <b>death</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> world. Danes is killed off in the final episode of the series; when death is restored he takes one of the Torchwood team's enemies out in a murder–suicide.|$|E
5|$|Their {{income was}} modest, with George's small per annum living; Cassandra brought the {{expectation}} of a small inheritance {{at the time of}} her mother's <b>death</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> marriage. They took up temporary residence at the nearby Deane rectory until Steventon, a 16th century house in disrepair, underwent necessary renovations. Cassandra gave birth to three children while living at Deane: James in 1765, George in 1766, and Edward in 1767. Her custom was to keep an infant at home for several months and then placed it with Elizabeth Littlewood, a woman living nearby to nurse and raise for twelve to eighteen months.|$|E
5|$|While in {{the eastern}} provinces, he came into {{conflict}} with the governor of Syria, Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso.

As a famous general, he was widely popular and regarded as the ideal Roman long after his <b>death.</b> <b>To</b> <b>the</b> Roman people, Germanicus was the Roman equivalent of Alexander the Great {{due to the nature of}} his death at a young age, his virtuous character, his dashing physique, and his military renown.|$|E
