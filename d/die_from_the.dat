5|$|The most {{recognized}} {{marker of}} acute Chagas disease is called Romaña's sign, which includes {{swelling of the}} eyelids {{on the side of}} the face near the bite wound or where the bug feces were deposited or accidentally rubbed into the eye. Rarely, young children, or adults may <b>die</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> acute disease due to severe inflammation/infection of the heart muscle (myocarditis) or brain (meningoencephalitis). The acute phase also can be severe in people with weakened immune systems.|$|E
5|$|With {{the help}} of an {{artificial}} leg, Fox was walking three weeks after the amputation. He then progressed to playing golf with his father. Doctors were impressed with Fox's positive outlook, stating it contributed to his rapid recovery. He endured sixteen months of chemotherapy and found the time he spent in the British Columbia Cancer Control Agency facility difficult as he watched fellow cancer patients suffer and <b>die</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> disease. Fox ended his treatment with new purpose: he felt he owed his survival to medical advances and wished to live his life {{in a way that would}} help others find courage.|$|E

5|$|Dying {{stands of}} B. coccinea were {{observed}} in 1989, and the fungus Cryptodiaporthe melanocraspedia isolated as the cause in 1995. The disease, a form of aerial canker, manifested initially as dead dry brown leaves and the tips of new growth. Plants would <b>die</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> top downwards, with larger branches affected over time. Under the outer bark, orange and brown patches of necrosis spread out from leaf nodes until they encircle the stem, which then dies. Flower spikes may be affected during flowering season. In humid spells during warm weather, white or pink spore tendrils are produced on dead wood. One affected stand monitored over three years from October 1989 to June 1992 showed a 97% mortality of plants (compared with a baseline 40%). Investigators Bryan Shearer and colleagues isolated another virulent pathogen that they identified as a species of Zythiostroma, however it appeared to invoke an immune response in the plant. This immune response, coupled {{with the fact that}} it had not been observed in the wild, led them to believe it was not a major pathogen of the species. This species has since been reclassified and named as Luteocirrhus shearii.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{returns to}} the railcar, seeing its door ajar; an alien-human test subject is locked in a room inside. The Red-Haired Man attacks Mulder, causing the {{conductor}} to lock them both in the car. The Red-Haired Man claims {{to work for the}} NSA, and that a bomb in the car was triggered after he gained entry with Zama's pass code. Mulder doesn't believe him, but he is called by Scully on the Red-Haired Man's cell phone. Scully—who is with the First Elder in a similar railcar—tells Mulder that unwitting subjects, including herself, were operated on by Zama in the secret railway, with the alien abduction theory used as a smokescreen. She also confirms that a bomb is in the car and believes that the quarantined patient is infected with hemorrhagic fever. She fears that thousands will <b>die</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> disease if the car explodes. Mulder finds the bomb in the ceiling.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Zoe Reynolds (Keeley Hawes) goes {{undercover}} to pose as a sympathizer to the cell. She lures a member, Rachel (Rachel Power) to {{the same}} hospital Sarah Lynott is being treated; Sarah would later <b>die</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> extent of her injuries. Senior case officer and team leader Tom Quinn (Matthew Macfadyen) attempts to persuade her to stop Kane, believing she has little regard for any life. Rachel leaves in haste, but unbeknownst to her, MI5 bug her mobile phone, and record a phone conversation she makes to the cell regarding their next target, Diane Sullivan, a doctor living in London. Tom's team are able to take Sullivan to safety whilst Zoe poses as the target. The team see Kane deliver a bomb to Zoe's car, and prepares to detonate it via mobile phone. To counter the attack, a Bomb Squad jams the signal long enough for Tom to arrest her. During the interrogation, Tom promises to send her to a state in the US where the death penalty does not apply {{in exchange for the}} locations of every cell she runs in the UK. After she cooperates, Tom goes back on the deal and delivers Kane to CIA liaison Christine Dale (Megan Dodds), who returns her to Florida to be executed.|$|E

25|$|According to Khafi Khan, {{the victorious}} pirates {{subjected}} their captives to {{an orgy of}} horror that lasted several days, raping and killing their terrified prisoners deck by deck. The pirates reportedly utilized torture to extract information from their prisoners, who had hidden the treasure in the ship's holds. Some of the Muslim women apparently committed suicide to avoid violation, while those women who did not kill themselves or <b>die</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> pirates' brutality were taken aboard the Fancy.|$|E
25|$|About 15–20% of hospitalized Lassa fever {{patients}} will <b>die</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> illness. The overall mortality rate {{is estimated to}} be 1%, but during epidemics, mortality can climb as high as 50%. The mortality rate is greater than 80% when it occurs in pregnant women during their third trimester; fetal death also occurs in nearly all those cases. Abortion decreases the risk of death to the mother. Some survivors experience lasting effects of the disease, and can include partial or complete deafness.|$|E

25|$|Derrick Cave {{is home to}} a {{population}} of Townsend's big-eared bats. The bats are very shy so visitors rarely see them. In fact, the bats usually remain in hibernation until July, and when active they are nocturnal so they are asleep during the day when the cave is open to the public. If a bat is sighted, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife recommends that it be left undisturbed. This is particularly important when the bats are hibernating. Waking a bat from hibernation is extremely stressful, and can cause the bat to <b>die</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sudden expenditure of energy.|$|E
25|$|An {{elderly woman}} {{connected}} to the shootings died from natural causes. Authorities believe the gunman started the shooting spree after finding his mother, the aforementioned elderly woman, dead on a couch from an illness for which she had been under a doctor's care, though this was unconfirmed. The disease was clarified in an autopsy to be metastatic lung cancer, although according to the woman's brother, it was breast cancer. A relative feared the woman did not <b>die</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> disease, and had instead been smothered to death by Aldridge. The woman was identified as 74-year-old Alice L. Aldridge.|$|E

This was during the 100 degree heat in July of a barren desert. Four soldiers and one buffalo hunter would <b>die</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> hot horror of the desert. The character and loyalty of the men involved would be severely tested as would their honor and duty. Some would be called heroes and others deserters, but most would state they were happy just to have survived.|$|E

25|$|One-third of the world's current {{population}} has been infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and new infections occur {{at a rate of}} one per second. About 5–10% of these latent infections will eventually progress to active disease, which, if left untreated, kills more than half of its victims. Annually, 8 million people become ill with tuberculosis, and 2 million people <b>die</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> disease worldwide. In the 19th century, tuberculosis killed an estimated one-quarter of the adult population of Europe; by 1918, one in six deaths in France were still caused by tuberculosis. During the 20th century, tuberculosis killed approximately 100 million people. TB {{is still one of the}} most important health problems in the developing world.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two forms}} of CPV2: {{intestinal}} and cardiac. Puppies are most susceptible, but more than 80 percent of adult dogs show no symptoms. With severe disease, dogs can die within 48 to 72 hours without treatment by fluids. In the more common, less severe form, mortality is about 10 percent. Certain breeds, such as Rottweilers, Doberman Pinschers, and Pit bull terriers {{as well as other}} black and tan colored dogs may be more susceptible to CPV2. Along with age and breed, factors such as a stressful environment, concurrent infections with bacteria, parasites, and canine coronavirus increase a dog's risk of severe infection. Dogs who catch Parvovirus usually <b>die</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> dehydration it causes or secondary infection rather than the virus itself.|$|E
25|$|Often {{performed}} by traditional practitioners using unsterile techniques and devices, FGM can have both immediate and late complications. These include excessive bleeding, urinary tract infections, wound infection, {{and in the}} case of unsterile and reused instruments, hepatitis and HIV. In the long run, scars and keloids can form, which can obstruct and damage the urinary and genital tracts. According to a 2005 UNICEF report on FGM, it is unknown how many girls and women <b>die</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> procedure because of poor record keeping and a failure to report fatalities. FGM may also complicate pregnancy and place women at a higher risk for obstetrical problems, such as prolonged labor. According to a 2006 study by the WHO involving 28,393 women, neonatal mortality increases when women have experienced FGM; an additional ten to twenty babies were estimated to die per 1,000 deliveries.|$|E
