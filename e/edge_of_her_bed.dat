60|$|She {{had reached}} her room now, {{and as she}} sat upon the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed</b> of ferns and grasses, with one hand resting upon her rising and falling bosom, she felt the hard {{outlines}} of the man's locket.|$|E
6000|$|She {{sat on the}} <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed</b> {{and looked}} about her, at her room, at the row of black-covered books and the pig's skull. [...] "I must take them," [...] she said, to help herself over her own incredulity. [...] "How shall I get my luggage out of the house?..." ...|$|E
60|$|One {{night when}} Margaret {{had gone up}} to her room, I put on a light overcoat, {{went out into the}} night and prowled for a long time through the narrow streets, smoking and thinking. I {{returned}} and went and sat on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed</b> to talk to her.|$|E
60|$|One {{morning the}} empress {{sat on the}} <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> husband's <b>bed,</b> and began to coax him {{with all sorts of}} pretty ways.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are weeping at the pathos of the air. Come here, and I will comfort you," [...] said Caroline, in a pitying accent. Mrs. Pryor came. She {{sat down}} on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> patient's <b>bed,</b> and allowed the wasted arms to {{encircle}} her.|$|R
60|$|At {{first she}} did not stir, lying very quiet {{and looking at the}} {{cash-box}} in Mr Verloc’s hand. But when she understood that her brother was “capering all over the place downstairs” she swung out in one sudden movement on to the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bed.</b> <b>Her</b> bare feet, as if poked through the bottom of an unadorned, sleeved calico sack buttoned tightly at neck and wrists, felt over the rug for the slippers while she looked upward into her husband’s face.|$|R
60|$|She {{took refuge}} in beating her pillow and inventing {{insulting}} epithets for herself. She got up, drew up her blind, and stared out of window at a dawn-cold vision of chimneys for a time, and then went {{and sat on the}} <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed.</b> What was the alternative to going home? No alternative appeared in that darkness.|$|E
60|$|May did not answer. With {{her face}} hid {{in her hands}} {{she sat on the}} <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed,</b> weeping at the thought of her lover's fallen condition. Poor May! People said that telegraphic work was too hard for her, because her cheeks were losing the fresh bloom that she had brought from the west of Ireland, and the fingers with which she {{manipulated}} the keys so deftly were growing very thin. But sorrow {{had more to do with}} the change than the telegraph had.|$|E
60|$|Instantly all the indignations {{which had}} been {{dominating}} him and the spiritual dramas through which he had struggled became pallid and absurd before the ancient and overwhelming realities, the standard and traditional realities, of sickness and menacing death, the long night, and the thousand steadfast implications of married life. He crept back to her. As she drowsed away in the tropic languor of morphia, {{he sat on the}} <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed,</b> holding her hand, {{and for the first time}} in many weeks her hand abode trustfully in his.|$|E
5000|$|Munch's {{painting}} Puberty {{depicts a}} young naked girl {{sitting on the}} <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> a <b>bed.</b> <b>Her</b> legs are pressed together. She holds her hands in front <b>of</b> <b>her</b> body; one lies between her knees, while the other rests on her right thigh. She stares straight ahead with eyes wide open. Her mouth is closed and her long hair hangs down over the shoulders. The light enters from the left, and behind her a dark, ominous shadow is visible. The motif is often regarded {{as a symbol of}} anxiety and fear, a young girl's awakening sexuality and the changes a young person experiences physically and psychologically on the path towards adulthood.|$|R
60|$|But Dolly sat at {{the side}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed,</b> and sobbed bitterly in her apron.|$|R
60|$|She {{rang the}} bell at the head <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed.</b> The person with the cap-ribbons appeared.|$|R
6000|$|... "What's the matter?" [...] He {{sat down}} on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed</b> and began to stroke her hair. For a long time she did not answer, and he went on {{stroking}} her hair mechanically, almost unconsciously; sometimes, even he bent down and kissed her bare shoulder. He had his own affairs, however, to think about. What had happened? How was it that the stupid gossip had actually come true? Emily had died of arsenic poisoning. It was absurd, impossible. The order of things had been broken, and he was at the mercy of an irresponsibility. What had happened, what was going to happen? He was interrupted {{in the midst of his}} thoughts.|$|E
6000|$|With a shrug {{she turned}} away and shut the door. She {{sat down on the}} <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed,</b> very still. In that little passage of wits she had won, she could win in many such; but the full hideousness of things had come to her. Lies! lies! That was to be her life! That; or to say {{farewell}} to all she now cared for, to cause despair not only in herself, but in her lover, and--for what? In order that her body might remain at the disposal of that man in the next room--her spirit having flown from him for ever. Such were the alternatives, unless those words: [...] "Then come to me," [...] were to be more than words. Were they? Could they be? They would mean such happiness if--if his love for her were more than a summer love? And hers for him? Was it--were they--more than summer loves? How know? And, without knowing, how give such pain to everyone? How break a vow she had thought herself quite above breaking? How make such a desperate departure from all the traditions and beliefs in which she had been brought up! But in the very nature of passion is that which resents the intrusion of hard and fast decisions.... And suddenly she thought: If our love cannot stay what it is, and if I cannot yet go to him for always, is there not still another way? ...|$|E

50|$|The Queen woke when he {{disturbed}} a curtain, {{and initial}} reports said Fagan {{sat on the}} <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed.</b> But in a 2012 interview, he said {{she left the room}} immediately to seek security. She had phoned the palace switchboard twice for police but none had arrived. Fagan then asked for some cigarettes, which were brought by a maid, who had been cleaning a neighbouring room. The duty footman, Paul Whybrew, who had been walking the Queen's dogs, then appeared, followed by two policemen on palace duty who removed Fagan. The incident had happened as the armed police officer outside the royal bedroom came off duty before his replacement arrived.|$|E
5000|$|In his 1975 autobiography, Tennessee Williams: Memoirs, {{the writer}} told {{of his time}} (1941) as a night shift {{elevator}} operator at the old San Jacinto Hotel in Manhattan. Among the hotel’s guest {{at the time was}} Witherspoon who, according to Williams, would employ him or the hotel’s telephone operator, a budding poet, to pick up her morphine prescription from an all-night pharmacy. She used to rap with me and the poet till nearly day break in the San Jacinto lobby. Her “fix” would never wear itself out till first cock’s crow. Then the poet and I would sort of lift her into the lift, the poet would open her bedroom door and I would get her to the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed</b> and let her drop on it.”What would I do without you boys?” she’d murmured with that sweet sad wisdom of the old who knows “all will pass.” Tennessee Williams, 1975 ...|$|E
50|$|When Vijay goes {{to fetch}} his lover Holly to help analyse the {{readings}} from the array, {{he finds the}} ghost of James, her dead lover, sitting at the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed.</b> James’ image dissolves into a fountain of light which nearly consumes Holly before Vijay manages to snap her fully awake. Meanwhile, the old folks’ bus crashes on {{its way out of}} town when the driver falls victim to the same force that prevented Lowcock and Yeadon from leaving. Tim Medway, the BBC reporter coming to interview Trevithick, feels no such influence when he enters the town, and when he comes across the accident he helps Jill to evacuate the stunned old folk to the monastery. Medway stops at the police station to report the accident, only to find them fully occupied by the disappearance of so many townspeople. He continues on to the pub, where Trevithick fills him in on the unbelievable events and decides to alert the Doctor, who seemed to believe his story. Medway, unable to accept what he's stumbled into, nevertheless agrees to drive Trevithick to the radiotelescope to look for the Doctor.|$|E

5000|$|Ivy {{was unaware}} that Julian {{was not in}} love with her when she married him, and when she {{discovered}} the true nature <b>of</b> <b>her</b> marriage on her wedding night, she became cold to her new husband and froze him out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed.</b> Though their marriage was loveless, they did occasionally experience brief bursts of passion, eventually producing four children together — son Ethan in 1975, daughter Fancy in 1980, son Nicholas Foxworth, and daughter Pretty.

60|$|Sadie, leaning with labored breath {{against the}} rail <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed,</b> heard him fall down {{the three or}} four steps {{in the middle of the}} passage and {{afterwards}} get up and go on again. Then she laughed, a strained, hysterical laugh.|$|R
6000|$|... "I really think, Mr. Haverley," [...] said Dora, {{turning toward}} the house, [...] "that I {{ought to go}} and arouse Miriam, {{and then we will}} retire. It is a {{positive}} shame to keep <b>her</b> out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed</b> any longer." ...|$|R
60|$|When Jane awoke, {{she did not}} {{at first}} recall the strange events of the {{preceding}} day, and so she wondered at her odd surroundings--the little leafy bower, the soft grasses <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed,</b> the unfamiliar prospect from the opening at her feet.|$|R
