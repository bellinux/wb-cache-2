5000|$|... 3-MC has an {{inhibitory}} {{function in}} a <b>dimethylnitrosamine</b> demethylase process in rat livers. Inhibition could happen on by interfering in demethylase conformations or by interfering in synthesis and/or degradation of demethylase.

Instead, incubation with 3-MC leads to {{a decrease in the}} amount of enzyme activity. These results point towards inhibition of demethylase synthesis and/or induction of demetylase degradation. Unpublished observations of Venkatesan, Argus and Arcos suggest that demethylase synthesis inhibition is most plausible.|$|E

Unbeknownst to the parties, the sodium nitrite preservative used in the Norwegian herring meal produced a substance, <b>dimethylnitrosamine</b> (DMNA), toxic to many animals, highly so to mink.

5000|$|The {{effect was}} first {{described}} in 1936 by Bachmann & Wiselogle. They heated pentaphenylethane and {{observed that the}} main reaction product was the starting product (87%) with only 2% of tetraphenylethane formed. They concluded that the dissociation of pentaphenylethane into triphenylmethyl and diphenylmethyl readicals was reversible and that persistent triphenylmethyl did not self terminate and transient diphenylmethyl did to a certain extent. In 1964 Perkins [...] performed a similar reaction with phenylazotriphenylmethane in benzene. Again the dimerization product of the persistent radical (phenylcyclohexydienyl) was absent as reaction product. In 1981 Geiger and Huber found that the photolysis of <b>dimethylnitrosamine</b> into the dimethylaminyl radical and nitrous oxide was also completely reversible. A similar effect was observed by Kräutler in 1984 for methylcobalamin. The term persistent radical effect was coined in 1992 by Daikh and Finke in work related to the thermolysis of a cyanocobalamin model compound. The persistent radical effect is relevant to living free-radical polymerization.|$|E

40|$|The {{intercellular}} {{distribution of}} O 6 -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) mRNA expression {{has been investigated}} at the individual cell level in the liver of rats treated with <b>dimethylnitrosamine</b> using in situ hybridization. Male BDIV rats were orally administered with a single dose of <b>dimethylnitrosamine</b> (5 or 10 mg/kg) and were killed at 24, 48, and 96 hours after exposure. Constitutive MGMT mRNA expression was found in bile duct cells, vascular endothelial cells, and fibrous cells; however, weak or negative expression was detected in hepatocytes and Kupffer cells. On the other hand, after exposure to <b>dimethylnitrosamine,</b> inducible MGMT mRNA was rapidly expressed in hepatocytes, especially in the centrilobular area at earlier time points, confirming our previous studies in which enzymatic activity has been measured in different purified cell populations obtained by differential centrifugation. Immunohistochemical detection of the O 6 -methylguanine-DNA adduct formation was demonstrated in a dose-dependent fashion and was mainly found in the centrilobular hepatocytes where high levels of MGMT mRNA were present. These results suggest a correlation between the induction of this repair activity and DNA damage; however, the relationship between MGMT mRNA and enzyme activity remains to be fully established for all cell types...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{administration}} of carbon tetrachloride and <b>dimethylnitrosamine</b> in vivo on hepatic microsomal function related to drug metabolism was measured. It {{was found that}} the capacity of isolated microsomes to demethylate dimethylaniline was diminished during the first hour after carbon tetrachloride poisoning and during the second hour after <b>dimethylnitrosamine</b> poisoning. Thereafter the microsomes from carbon tetrachloride-poisoned livers showed a continuous decline in activity so that at 24 hr. there was little residual capacity to undertake demethylation. Microsomes from dimethylnitrosamine-poisoned animals were not different from controls at 24 hr. During the first 3 hr. there was a transient rise in the accumulation of the N-oxide intermediate in carbon tetrachloride-poisoned livers, with a subsequent fall to below control values. In <b>dimethylnitrosamine</b> poisoning there was a parallel decrease in N-oxide accumulation with decreased demethylation. In {{the latter part of the}} first 24 hr. the ratio of N-oxide accumulation to demethylation was increased in both instances. At 2 hr. after poisoning with either compound there was no evidence of altered NADPH 2 -dependent neotetrazolium reduction or lipid peroxidation. NADPH 2 -dependent azo-dye cleavage was decreased. There was no difference in microsomal cytochrome b 5 content, but there was a decrease in the amount of cytochrome P- 450. This latter change was correlated with the decreased capacity for NADPH 2 -dependent oxidative demethylation. It is suggested that <b>dimethylnitrosamine</b> is associated with a defect in microsomal NADPH 2 -dependent electron transport at the level of cytochrome P- 450. In addition to affecting cytochrome P- 450, carbon tetrachloride is associated with a second severe block involving the release of formaldehyde from the N-oxide intermediate...|$|E

40|$|Background—Hepatic stellate cells play a {{key role}} in the {{pathogenesis}} of hepatic fibrosis.  Aims—To examine the inhibitory effect of oestradiol on stellate cell activation.  Methods—In vivo, hepatic fibrosis was induced in rats by <b>dimethylnitrosamine</b> or pig serum. In vitro, rat stellate cells were activated by contact with plastic dishes resulting in their transformation into myofibroblast-like cells.  Results—In the <b>dimethylnitrosamine</b> and pig serum models, treatment with oestradiol at gestation related doses resulted in a dose dependent suppression of hepatic fibrosis with restored content of hepatic retinyl palmitate, reduced collagen content, lower areas of stellate cells which express α smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and desmin, and lower procollagen type I and III mRNA levels in the liver. In cultured stellate cells, oestradiol inhibited type I collagen production, α-SMA expression, and cell proliferation. These findings suggest that oestradiol is a potent inhibitor of stellate cell transformation.  Conclusion—The antifibrogenic role of oestradiol in the liver may contribute to the sex associated differences in the progression from hepatic fibrosis to cirrhosis. ...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY-Liver tumor {{incidence}} was 26 % in male MRC rats receiving 5 {{parts per}} million (ppm) <b>dimethylnitrosamine</b> in their drinking water for 30 weeks. A significantly different liver tumor incidence of 3 % was observed in a second group of rats receiving fully deuterated <b>dimethylnitrosamine</b> under identical conditions. -JNatl Cancer Inst 51 : 299 - 302, 1973. CHEMICAL SPECIES differing only in the na-ture of their isotopic composition can normally be regarded as identical with respect to whole-molecu-lar properties such as size, shape, and solubility. They may, however, vary markedly as to chemical reactivity, since more energy is generally required to rupture a bond to a heavier isotope. These dif-ferences are particularly pronounced when protium (lH) is replaced by the heavier isotopes deuterium (2 H) or tritium (3 H). A large reduction (e. g., two-fold or greater) {{in the rate of}} a given chemical re-action following deuteration or tritiation at a specific position usually constitutes excellent evi-dence that the isotopically substituted bond is undergoing cleavage during the rate-determining step. The study of such "primary kinetic isotope effects " has thus furnished a most powerful ap-proach to investigating mechanisms of organic chemical and biochemical reactions (1 - 3). Data concerning the isotope effects on various types of gross pharmacologic response are poten-tially equally rewarding, and various recent in-vestigations have used this tool to advantage (4 - 7). Since effects of isotopic substitution on an agent's distribution throughout the organism are minimal, observable differences in pharmacologic effect can be discussed in terms of the strengths of bonds being cleaved during critical steps such as pharmacologic activation and detoxication.

40|$|THE {{carcinogenic}} N-nitroso compounds can induce tumours in {{a variety}} of organs and species, sometimes after only one dose (Magee and Schoental, 1964; Druckrey et al., 1967; Magee and Barnes, 1967). The acute tissue-damaging and carcinogenic action of these compounds may be due to their ability to act as alkylating agents in vivo but other mechanisms have also been suggested (Druckrey et al., 1967; Magee and Barnes, 1967). The biochemical evidence that the nitroso carcinogens alkylate cellular components in vivo has been mainly derived from work with <b>dimethylnitrosamine</b> (Fig. 1) (Magee and Hultin, 1962; Magee and Farber, 1962; Craddock and Magee, 1963).
