Catherine, in bed with a lung infection, <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>kept</b> in the dark. The king's actions effectively ended her days of power.|$|E
5|$|Upon Queen Victoria's death, Beatrice {{began the}} momentous task of transcribing and editing her mother's journals, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>kept</b> since 1831. The {{hundreds}} of volumes contained the Queen's personal {{views of the}} day-to-day business {{of her life and}} included personal and family matters as well as matters of state.|$|E
5|$|In 1850, the Duchess of Kent's new comptroller, Sir George Couper, {{studied the}} old accounts. He found huge discrepancies. No records for her {{household}} or personal expenses <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>kept</b> after 1829. There was also {{no record of}} nearly £50,000 the Duchess had received from her brother, Leopold, nor of an additional £10,000 from William IV.|$|E

I feel that human society <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>kept</b> in darkness {{for thousands of years}} by the use of symbols. I revolt against it. By raising the issue of symbols, in the name of symbols, my perspective <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>kept</b> limited." ...|$|R
5|$|On September 27, 1992, two Journalists {{working for}} the {{magazine}} Shukan Bunshun, Akira Kato and Shun'ichi Kobayashi, publicly revealed evidence of Nosaka's involvement {{in the deaths of}} Kenzo Yamamoto and his wife. On a trip to Moscow, Kobayashi and Kato had managed to purchase a number of KGB documents, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>kept</b> secret since the Stalinist era. Among these documents was the letter that Nosaka had written in 1939 denouncing Yamamoto and his wife.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, Sue Ellen's {{alcoholism}} returns, and her {{struggles with}} it become {{a recurring theme}} in the third season, putting a strain on {{her relationship with her}} son. Eventually she learns the truth about the circumstances surrounding J.R's death, and is angered at both Bobby and Bum that she <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>kept</b> in the dark about his illness and his final plan, although she makes amends.|$|E
5|$|The former Parliamentarian, Colonel John Hutchinson, was infamously {{detained}} by the Crown at Sandown in 1664; his wife, Lucy, who subsequently widely publicised his case, described the castle as ruinous and his imprisonment there as inhumane. After several months Hutchinson {{died in the}} castle, his doctor blaming his physical decline on {{the conditions in which}} he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>kept.</b>|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the Old Bay Line's {{dissolution}} in April 1962, three ships remained docked at the Pratt Street pier: the District of Columbia, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>kept</b> as a spare since the Washington–Norfolk service ended in 1957, was scrapped soon afterwards. The City of Richmond was sold for use as a floating restaurant in the Virgin Islands, but sank in the Atlantic Ocean off Georgetown, South Carolina, while under tow to her new home. The City of Norfolk was idled in Norfolk until 1966, when it was towed to Fieldsboro, New Jersey on the Delaware River and scrapped.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the names}} of the eight players <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>kept</b> secret, the general public was not {{informed}} that Bruce Smith, who had developed into one of the best defensive players in the country, {{would not be able to}} participate in the 1984 Independence Bowl. Only when Smith filed suit to force Virginia Tech and the NCAA to allow him to play in the game was the situation revealed. Dr. Cecil Lloyd, chairman of the Independence Bowl, announced at the time of the lawsuit that had he known about the restrictions on Smith, he likely would not have invited Tech to play in the game.|$|E
5|$|Many {{commentators}} and cricketers deplored {{the use of}} Bodyline bowling. Some felt {{frustration that}} Woodfull had not publicly condemned the tactics, believing that his silence was interpreted as approval. Once his opinions were revealed by the leak, opponents of Bodyline felt publicly legitimised and expressed their opinions more freely. It also revealed deep and unaccustomed divisions between the teams which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>kept</b> from view. The leak and subsequent events in the same match brought varied opinions from journalists and former players on Bodyline into the newspapers, both for and against Bodyline tactics.|$|E

5|$|Matsui sailed out of Shanghai on February 21, 1938 {{and landed}} back in Japan on February 23. Though {{the time and}} place of his return to Japan <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>kept</b> secret by the military, reporters quickly caught wind of his return and soon Matsui was being greeted {{everywhere}} he went by cheering crowds. Later that year Matsui bought a new home in Atami in Shizuoka Prefecture and from then until 1946 he spent his winters living in Atami and his summers living at his old house on Lake Yamanaka.|$|E
5|$|Rodney So'oialo {{was made}} {{stand-in}} captain {{and started the}} TriNations with a win and two losses. McCaw returned for the fourth game and the All Blacks won the remaining three matches to retain the TriNations title and Bledisloe Cup. McCaw {{was seen as an}} inspiration after his return from injury, with Henry rating his performance in the 19–0 win in South Africa (the first time the South Africans <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>kept</b> scoreless on home soil in 105 years) as his best so far for the All Blacks.|$|E
5|$|The Welsh {{performance}} during the 1893 Home Nations Championship was {{in stark contrast}} to the previous year. Under the captaincy of Gould, Wales not only won the Championship for the first time, but also the Triple Crown. The first match of the campaign was against England, and played at the Cardiff Arms Park. The pitch <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>kept</b> from freezing over the night before by 500 braziers dispersed across the playing field. This led to a slippery ground, with play further hampered by a strong wind.|$|E

5|$|A {{thousand}} {{copies of}} the report were printed by lithography at the Pentagon, and deposited in Groves's office in the New War Department Building in Washington, DC, where they were kept securely locked away. Final approval was sought from the President, Harry S. Truman, in {{a meeting at the}} White House on August 9, 1945, three days after the bombing of Hiroshima. Stimson, Harrison, Groves, Conant, Vannevar Bush, and Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy presented their views, and Truman authorized the immediate release of the report. The War Department released the thousand {{copies of the}} report that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>kept</b> in Groves's office to the media for use by the radio broadcasters with an embargo time of 9:00 pm on August 11, 1945, and for the newspapers of August 12.|$|E
5|$|By this time, with France {{preparing}} {{to withdraw from}} Indochina, senior French officers had begun to undermine Diệm's leadership and his attempts to stabilise South Vietnam. The VNA later implicated the French in the organisation of weapons air drops to Ba Cụt, prompting a protest from Diệm's government. Diệm complained to a French general, alleging that Ba Cụt's men were using French equipment that was of higher quality than that given to the VNA. The Hòa Hảo accused Diệm of treachery in his negotiations with various groups. They charged the prime minister with integrating Thế's forces into the VNA in return for them being allowed to attack Ba Cụt {{with the aid of}} the VNA, and that this part of the deal <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>kept</b> secret. They warned that other Hòa Hảo leaders who had stopped fighting could join Ba Cụt, and appealed to Diệm's U.S. sponsors. In response, Ba Cụt ambushed a VNA unit in Long Mỹ, killing three officers and injuring some thirty men.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, Chatwin {{moved to}} London {{to begin work}} as a porter in the Works of Art {{department}} at Sotheby's. Chatwin was ill-suited for this job, which included dusting objects that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>kept</b> in storage. Sotheby's moved him to a junior cataloger position working in both the Antiquities and Impressionist Art departments. This position enabled him to develop his eye for art, and he quickly became known {{for his ability to}} discern forgeries. His work as a cataloguer also taught him to describe objects in a concise manner and required him to research these objects. Chatwin advanced to become Sotheby's expert on Antiquities and Impressionist art and would later run both departments. Many of Chatwin's colleagues thought he would eventually become chairman of the auction house.|$|E

5|$|Judy was a {{pure-bred}} {{liver and}} white Pointer. She {{was born in}} February 1936 in the Shanghai Dog Kennels, a boarding kennel used by English expatriates in Shanghai, China. Judy was one of seven puppies to a dog named Kelly owned by a couple from Sussex. At {{the age of three}} months, she escaped and <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>kept</b> in a back alley by a shopkeeper until she was six months old. Following an altercation with some sailors from a Japanese Navy gunboat, she was found by a worker from the kennel and returned there. She was originally called Shudi, which was anglicised to become Judy. By the time she returned to the kennel, her mother and siblings were no longer there.|$|E
5|$|The monastery {{itself was}} founded by Senekerim-Hovhannes early in his reign (1003–24) to house {{a relic of the}} True Cross that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>kept</b> on the site since Hripsime. In 1021, when Vaspurakan fell to Byzantine rule, Senekerim-Hovhannes took the relic to Sebastia, where the {{following}} year his son Atom founded the Surb Nshan Monastery. In 1025, following his death, Senekerim-Hovhannes was buried at Varagavank and the True Cross was returned to the monastery. Fearing an attack by Muslims, Varagavank Father Ghukas took the True Cross in 1237 to the Tavush region of northeastern Armenia. There he settled in the Anapat monastery, which was renamed Nor Varagavank. In 1318, the Mongols invaded the region and ransacked the monastery. All the churches were destroyed except St. Hovhannes, which had an iron door and was where the monks hid. Between 1320 and the 1350s, the monastery was completely restored.|$|E
5|$|Vice Admiral Ryūnosuke Kusaka {{flew from}} Tokyo on 5 April to Tokuyama {{in a final}} attempt to {{convince}} the assembled commanders of the Combined Fleet—including Admiral Itō—to accept the plan. Upon first hearing of the proposed operation (it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>kept</b> secret from most of them), the Combined Fleet commanders and captains unanimously joined Admiral Itō in rejecting it {{for the same reasons}} that he had expressed. Admiral Kusaka then explained that the Navy's attack would help divert U.S. aircraft away from the Army's planned kamikaze attacks on the U.S. fleet at Okinawa. He also explained that Japan's national leadership, including the emperor, were expecting the Navy to make their best effort to support the defense of Okinawa.|$|E
