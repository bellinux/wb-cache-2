5|$|A {{recent study}} of raven {{mitochondrial}} DNA showed that the isolated population from the Canary Islands is distinct from other populations. The study did not include any individuals from the North African population, and its position is therefore unclear, though its morphology <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> to {{the population of the}} Canaries (to the extent that the two are often considered part of a single subspecies).|$|E

The errors of itacism occur, but not so often as in Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus. It uses grammatical forms typical of the ancient manuscripts (e.g. ειπαν, ηλθαν, ευραν), which are not used in later medieval manuscripts.|$|E

5|$|The city added 19 public schools, a {{regional}} mall, shopping centers and parks between 1970 and 2000 {{in response to}} rapid population growth. The construction of the Sawgrass Expressway in 1986 brought even more growth. A museum and a theater opened in the 1990s.

5|$|Common {{trees are}} oaks, willows and alders, which {{tolerate}} wet soils. Because the phreatic table <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> to the surface, soils hardly freeze {{in winter and}} drought rarely occurs in summer. The nature reserve also has meadows and reed beds. Common animals include a large variety of birds (storks, curlews, harriers), amphibians and mammals (beavers). The reserve {{is home to the}} largest fallow deer population in France. This animal was introduced to the area in 1854.|$|E

Consequently, during the 2014–15 season, {{an expansion of}} the stadium was undertaken. The South Stand was extended {{with the addition of a}} third tier which, in conjunction with an additional three rows of pitch side seating, increased stadium capacity to approximately 55,000. Construction commenced on the South Stand in April 2014 and was completed for the start of the 2015–16 season.|$|E
5|$|However, {{during the}} 1960s, the Court under Chief Justice Warren took the process much further, making almost all {{guarantees}} of the Bill of Rights binding upon the states. Thus, although the Court failed to accept Black's theory of total incorporation, {{the end result}} of its jurisprudence <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> to what Black advocated. Today, the only parts of the first eight amendments that have not been extended to the states are the Third and Seventh Amendments, the grand jury clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Eighth Amendment's protection against excessive bail, and the guarantee of the Sixth Amendment, as interpreted, that criminal juries be composed of 12 members and be unanimous in their verdicts.|$|E

5|$|Male {{and female}} guinea pigs {{do not differ}} in {{external}} appearance apart from general size. The position of the anus <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> to the genitals in both sexes. Female genitals are distinguished by a Y-shaped configuration formed from a vulvar flap, while the male genitals may look similar, with the penis and anus forming a like shape, the penis will protrude if pressure {{is applied to the}} surrounding hair. The male's testes may also be visible externally from scrotal swelling.|$|E
5|$|Natural predators of the California {{spiny lobster}} include bony fish {{such as the}} California sheephead, giant sea bass and cabezone, sharks {{including}} the horn shark and leopard shark, octopuses and sea otters. In response to an approaching predator, spiny lobsters including the California spiny lobster can produce a loud noise using the stick-slip phenomenon, akin to a bowed instrument. The bases of the antennae act as a plectrum, which is rubbed over a file {{on the edge of}} the antennular plate. If a predator <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>close,</b> spiny lobsters will flex their muscular tail in order to escape the predator, backwards.|$|E

5|$|The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 {{mandated}} that all new construction on transit stations including making the stations handicapped accessible. Because the 1885 depot <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> to the tracks, such upgrades {{at the old}} station location would have been difficult. New platforms, with mini-high platforms on their west ends for level boarding, were built {{just west of the}} former station. A footbridge with two elevators was built to allow passengers to reach the outbound platform without crossing the tracks, which carry slow-moving CSX freight service as well as MBTA and Amtrak trains. The new station was built in 2000 and opened in early 2001.|$|E
5|$|The intra-deltaic {{coastline}} <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> to the tectonic interface of the Indian and Burmese plates, {{as well as}} {{the active}} Andaman–Nicobar fault system, and is often capable of generating tsunamis. Cyclone preparedness measures are inadequate for the 200,000residents of Sitakunda who were estimated to be living in high risk areas after the 1991 cyclone. For every 5,000 people, Sitakunda has only one cyclone shelter, each of which is capable of holding 50 to 60people. Syedpur Union has eleven, Muradpur eight, Baraiyadhala seven, and Kumira five. Sitakunda municipality, Barabkunda, Bhatiary and Bansbaria have four shelters each. Salimpur has three and Sonaichhari Union has two shelters.|$|E

There are also a number of bus services in the area, and Turf Moor <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> to Burnley Bus Station.|$|E
5|$|The 2015 {{census of}} Malaysia {{reported}} {{a population of}} 2,636,000 in Sarawak, making it the fourth most populous state.

Although it has a low population density, the average population growth rate of 1.8%, from 2000 to 2010, <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> to the national average of 2.0%. In 2014, 58% of the population resided in urban areas with the remainder in rural areas, but over the next 10 years it is predicted that the urban population would rise to 65%. , the crude birth rate in Sarawak was 16.3 per 1000 individuals, the crude death rate was 4.3 per 1000 population, and the infant mortality rate was 6.5 per 1000 live births.|$|E
