Kerslake prepared five treatments during July and August 1993, but no shoot arrangements were made {{and by the end}} of the month, the group decided to work with Dutch photographer and video director Anton Corbijn. Corbijn, who typically created his own ideas for videos, was initially unsure of directing the video since Cobain's treatment was so detailed. Corbijn said, [...] "But then <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> and I thought that actually it was pretty good. I was very amazed by somebody writing a song and having those ideas as precise as he did." ...|$|E
500|$|As a consequence, Russell was {{extremely}} sensitive to all racial prejudice: according to Taylor, he often perceived insults even if others did not. He {{was active in}} the Black Power movement and supported Muhammad Ali's decision to refuse to be drafted. He was often called [...] "Felton X", presumably {{in the tradition of the}} Nation of Islam's practice of replacing a European slave name with an [...] "X", and even purchased land in Liberia. Russell's public statements became increasingly militant, so far that he was quoted in a 1963 Sports Illustrated interview with the words: [...] "I dislike most white people because they are people... I like most blacks because I am black"; however, Russell articulated these views with a measure of self-criticism: [...] "I consider this a deficiency in myself—maybe. If <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> objectively, detached myself, it would be a deficiency." [...] However, when his white Celtics teammate Frank Ramsey asked whether he hated him, Russell claimed to be misquoted, but few believed it.|$|E
500|$|In 1962 Littleton’s first {{pieces in}} blown glass were, like his earlier works in pottery, {{functional}} forms: vases, bowls and paperweights. His breakthrough to non-functional form came in 1963 when, with no purpose in mind, he remelted and finished a glass piece {{that he had}} earlier smashed {{in a fit of}} pique. The object lay in his studio for several weeks before he decided to grind the bottom. As Littleton recounts in his book Glassblowing: A Search for Form, he brought the object into the house where [...] "it aroused such antipathy in my wife that <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> much more closely, finally deciding to send it to an exhibition. Its refusal there made me even more obstinate, and I took it to New York ... I later showed it to the curators of design at the Museum of Modern Art. They, perhaps relating it to some other neo-Dada work in the museum, purchased it for the Design Collection." [...] This led to Littleton’s mid-1960s series of broken-open forms, and [...] "Prunted," [...] "Imploded" [...] and [...] "Exploded" [...] forms.|$|E

500|$|Another actress to {{join the}} show was Academy Award winner Whoopi Goldberg, {{who had been a}} long-time Star Trek fan. She {{credited}} Nichelle Nichols as Uhura in The Original Series as an inspiration, saying [...] "Well, when I was nine years old Star Trek came on, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> and I went screaming through the house, 'Come here, mum, everybody, come quick, come quick, there's a black lady on television and she ain't no maid!' I knew right then and there I could be anything I wanted to be." [...] To appear on the show, Goldberg contacted the producers initially through LeVar Burton. The producers did not believe her as they felt that a movie star such as Goldberg would not want to appear in Star Trek, and ignored calls from her agent, until Goldberg called them personally. A meeting was arranged between her and Rick Berman, and she agreed to appear in six episodes of season two. Her character, Guinan, was named after Mary [...] "Texas" [...] Guinan, a prohibition-era speakeasy owner.|$|E
500|$|Several {{actors were}} cast in roles which recurred {{throughout}} the seven seasons {{on television and}} into the four feature films. Majel Barrett, referred to as [...] "The First Lady of Star Trek" [...] due to her marriage with Roddenberry, appeared both {{as the voice of}} Starfleet computers and as Lwaxana Troi. The part of Lwaxana was specifically created for her. She had appeared in The Original Series and two Star Trek films as Christine Chapel, and as Number One in the original pilot [...] "". John de Lancie was cast as Q despite missing his first audition as it conflicted with a play he was in at the time. A second audition was arranged, where de Lancie impressed Roddenberry, who told him that [...] "You make my words sound better than they are." [...] Colm Meaney was originally cast as an unnamed Ensign in [...] "Encounter at Farpoint", but was subsequently cast as the Transporter Chief Miles O'Brien, appearing in 52 episodes in that role. Whoopi Goldberg approached the producers and asked for a role in the show, resulting in Roddenberry writing her the part of Guinan. She credits Nichelle Nichols as Uhura in The Original Series as inspiring her, saying [...] "when I was nine years old Star Trek came on, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> and I went screaming through the house, 'Come here, mom, everybody, come quick, come quick, there's a black lady on television and she ain't no maid!'

2500|$|She then studied medieval {{history at}} Bryn Mawr College in Lower Merion Township, Pennsylvania.

2500|$|The Smashing Pumpkins' albums Monuments to an Elegy (2014) {{and their}} {{upcoming}} tenth album (2016) will conclude the Teargarden by Kaleidyscope project. Corgan is unsure when Teargarden by Kaleidyscope {{will result in}} a box set, as originally announced, but it could include up to approximately 60 previously unreleased demos recorded for the project. He also stated that the future of the band is up in the air following the project's completion, saying: [...] "as I said {{at the beginning of the}} Teargarden project, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> like, OK, I'm going to take this journey, and when this journey is over—which it now will be with Day for Night—it will [...] be the beginning [...] a new era of what the Smashing Pumpkins could be in the 21st century, or it will be the end. In big capital letters. Goodbye, I'm done." ...|$|E
2500|$|British occultist Aleister Crowley {{reported}} witnessing what {{he referred}} to as [...] "globular electricity" [...] during a thunderstorm on Lake Pasquaney in New Hampshire in 1916. [...] He was sheltered in a small cottage when he [...] "noticed, with what I can only describe as calm amazement, that a dazzling globe of electric fire, apparently between six and twelve inches (15–30cm) in diameter, was stationary about six inches below {{and to the right}} of my right knee. As <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> it exploded with a sharp report quite impossible to confuse with the continuous turmoil of the lightning, thunder and hail, or that of the lashed water and smashed wood which was creating a pandemonium outside the cottage. I felt a very slight shock {{in the middle of my}} right hand, which was closer to the globe than any other part of my body." ...|$|E
