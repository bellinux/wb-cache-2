The cabin door's unusual shape was to allow the engine to be loaded and unloaded, and a specially-fitted 'porthole' {{on the other side of}} the cabin would be removed to allow the propeller boss to protrude out the side of the aircraft. Spare engines were not carried routinely (the DH.34's payload was too low to carry both passengers and a spare engine) but this facility was used by operators to quickly fly spare engines out to aircraft that had suffered breakdown.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{motion of}} tiny non-Brownian {{inertial}} particles in a two-dimensional channel flow with periodic corrugations is investigated analytically, {{to determine the}} trapping rate {{as well as the}} exact position of the attractor, and understand the conditions under which particle trapping and long-term suspension occur. This phenomenon has been observed numerically in previous works and happens under the combined effects of confinement and <b>inertia.</b> <b>Starting</b> from the particle motion equations, a Poincare map is constructed analytically in the limit of weak inertia and weak channel corrugations. It enables to derive the equation of the attractor, if any, and the corresponding trapping rate. The attractor is close to a streamline, the so-called ``attracting streamline'', and is shown to persist in the presence of transverse gravity, provided the channel Froude number is large enough. Particles which are trapped by this streamline can therefore travel over long distances, avoiding deposition. Numerical simulations confirm the theoretical results at small particle response times tau and reveal some non-linear effects at larger tau: the asymptotic attractor becomes unstable at some critical value and splits into multiple branches each with its own basin of attraction...|$|E
40|$|A realização deste trabalho teve como objetivo {{principal}} conhecer o processo de adaptação estratégica da empresa Vargem Bela, produtora de cachaça no Brejo paraibano. Primeiro, identificou-se os eventos críticos ocorridos no período de 1961 a 2007 e verificou-se sob quais condições estes eventos ocorreram, para então, analisá-los sob a perspectiva da Teoria Institucional e da Visão Baseada em Recursos. Com essa finalidade, foi feita uma revisão na literatura existente sobre as referidas teorias, com ênfase nos trabalhos de DiMaggio e Powell (2005), no que diz respeito à Teoria Institucional, e Peteraf (1993) e Barney e Herterly (2007) no que se refere à Visão Baseada em Recursos. O trabalho é uma pesquisa qualitativa, descritiva e exploratória, que se deu através de um estudo de caso que teve sua sustentação metodológica baseada no trabalho de Pettigrew (1987), sobre métodos de adaptação estratégica de empresas, onde são investigados três elementos da mudança: o contexto (interno e externo), o conteúdo e o processo. A pesquisa possibilitou concluir que o processo de adaptação estratégica vivido pela empresa, apresenta características diferentes em dois períodos temporais distintos. O primeiro período, que vai de 1961 até 1986, em que a postura organizacional assumida no processo de mudança é mais proativa, foram realizadas aquisições de ativos tangíveis e intangíveis capazes de construir vantagens competitivas sustentáveis tornando a empresa mais competitiva e líder de mercado. Entretanto, no segundo período, que vai de 1986 a 2007, a postura assumida pela empresa passa a ser mais reativa, numa demonstração de inércia organizacional, passando a atuar no sentido de atender às pressões ambientais.

40|$|Small wind {{turbines}} have difficulties to start rotating at low wind speeds {{due to their}} relatively large rotor <b>inertia</b> and small <b>starting</b> torque. In case a permanent magnet generator is used, the rotor magnets will cause an additional cogging torque which makes starting even more difficult.

A {{maximum power point tracking}} algorithm is used to locate the optimal working point. At sufficiently large rotor speeds, the controller switches to the generator mode where the energy used for acceleration is recuperated, together with the additional energy captured from the wind gust. To control the generator power in both directions, an active rectifier is used in a back-to-back converter topology. In this paper, this wind capture strategy is simulated. The results show that the power output during a wind gust can be largely increased compared to common MPP-tracking...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{symmetry}} {{energy and the}} core-crust transition in neutron stars using the finite-range Gogny nuclear interaction and examine the deduced crustal thickness and crustal moment of <b>inertia.</b> We <b>start</b> by analyzing the second-, fourth- and sixth-order coefficients of the Taylor expansion of the energy per particle in powers of the isospin asymmetry for Gogny forces. These coefficients provide information about {{the departure of the}} symmetry energy from the widely used parabolic law. The neutron star core-crust transition is evaluated by looking at the onset of thermodynamical instability of the liquid core. The calculation is performed with the exact (i. e., without Taylor expansion) Gogny EoS for the core, and also with its Taylor expansion in order to assess the influence of isospin expansions on locating the inner edge of neutron star crusts. It is found that the properties of the core-crust transition derived from the exact EoS differ from the predictions of the Taylor expansion even when the expansion is carried through sixth order in the isospin asymmetry. Gogny forces, using the exact EoS, predict the ranges 0. 094 fm^- 3 ≲ρ_t ≲ 0. 118 fm^- 3 for the transition density and 0. 339 MeV fm^- 3 ≲ P_t ≲ 0. 665 MeV fm^- 3 for the transition pressure. The transition densities show an anticorrelation with the slope parameter L of the symmetry energy. The transition pressures are not found to correlate with L. Neutron stars obtained with Gogny forces have maximum masses below 1. 74 M_ and relatively small moments of inertia. The crustal mass and moment of inertia are evaluated and comparisons are made with the constraints from observed glitches in pulsars.

40|$|The basic {{premises}} {{of this study}} is that the poor people should not be manipulated by the rich and powerful for their selfish end. Though they are poor, they are God’s people and God loves them as well. Growing up in the poor rural areas of Herschel, the researcher was the victim of apartheid laws at an early age. He experienced the pangs of hunger and on many occasions was tempted to steal. As a small boy he had many unanswered questions, when he saw white boys of his age being well fed, clad, and staying in beautiful homes. Later as a minister, working with Rev. S. R. Kumalo, in Ivory Park informal settlement, the researcher was touched by the plight of the poor living in shacks. In 2001 he was stationed in the neighbouring Olievenhoutbosch informal settlement. Here he was confronted with circumstances that perpetuated poverty among the poor, such as lack of job opportunities, no formal school buildings, sports facilities that keep the youth away from crime, no sites for churches, shops, clinics and police station. The people felt neglected and betrayed by the very government they voted for in 1994 and 1998. The government has failed to fulfill the promises made then. The poor even question the existence of God, as poverty in this area is absolute. If God does exist, as far as they are concerned, he has either forgotten them, or turned his back on them. Caring for the poor was a major challenge to the researcher. He had to study and acquire skills of empowering and liberating the poor from their morass. The researcher used Gerkin’s biblical traditional method of shepherding God’s people, as used in Old Testament times. He also applied Masango’s liberation theology as a way out to freedom from bondage of oppression. The researcher also identified five forms of poverty that affects the poor people of Olievenhoutbosch, but emphasis is zeroed on economic poverty, as it affects all their spheres of life. The daily struggle of the poor here is how to keep the body and soul together. The economic poverty has resulted in other evil repercussions, such as prostitution or sex work, which in turn leads to wide spread of pandemic HIV/AIDS, crime such as house breakings, car hijackings and general robbery, are on the increase. The poor are neglected by the politicians and the rich. Every time during political campaigns the politicians remember that there are people to be addressed in Olievenhoutbosch, they visit them. After elections the politicians disappear to come back again when there is the next political campaign. The researcher views this as the manipulation of the poor by the powerful for their own selfish ends. The researcher has included the stories of the poor to back up their suffering after being used as pawns by the politicians. As means of healing the poor people of Olievenhoutbosch informal settlement, the researcher has recommended some pastoral care guidelines. The poor must be encouraged to re-evaluate and come out of their state of <b>inertia</b> and <b>start</b> to live a new life. They must be empowered to use their voting power to change their circumstances and lives. They must end their exploitation through their sheer numbers. The lesson of liberation will also focus on the powerful as they are the victims of greed and power hungry. Nobody can really be happy and live comfortably when the neighbor is starving and unhappy. The boycotts and marches taking place recently in the townships are a sign that the masses can no longer tolerate their sufferings, and unfulfilled promises. In concluding this study the researcher has suggested the way forward for pastoral care-givers. He has further suggested some researches that need to be done. At the end of this study the researcher also became aware of his own weaknesses, which are his personal ongoing struggles and challenges that must be subdued in the new democratic South Africa.

40|$|The term Privatization {{is often}} loosely used {{to mean a}} number of related activities, {{including}} any expansion {{of the scope of}} private sector activity in an economy and the adoption by the public sector of efficiency enhancing techniques commonly employed by the private sector. While acknowledging that no definition of privatization is water tight, we will define privatization, {{for the purpose of this}} paper, as the transfer of productive asset ownership and control from the public to the private sector. 1 The transfer of assets can be total, partial or functionary, with the sale being implemented by methods such as private sales, leasing arrangements, employee buy outs and share issues. In Africa, many governments have embraced the idea of privatization, brought to the fore mainly as a part of the adjustment and stabilization programs of the mid-eighties and the nineties. Privatization now frequently features in government policy statements and in conditionalities from donors. The past decade has also seen the World Bank and other donors get increasingly involved in lending operations towards parastatal sector reforms that included privatization components. African countries share a number of common features in relation to the drive towards privatization. For most of these countries, the first twenty years of independence were characterized by rapid growth, driven by favorable terms of trade and high levels of public investments in infrastructure and services. The development of import substituting industries brought in the dramatic rise of parastatal corporations, which were also used as vehicles for increased local participation in the economies. Many governments moved to nationalize existing foreign interests in their countries and also to create new state enterprises to carry out the various production and trading functions. Parastatal corporations rapidly dominated the extractive industries, manufacturing and financial sectors of their economies, and acquired important economic and political status, becoming major sources of employment. The moderate growth experienced in the seventies, however, was quickly reversed by the financial crisis of the early eighties, and associated inefficiencies made parastatal sector reform a major element in the reform efforts implemented by the countries. Zambia was one of the earlier countries to embark on a major privatization exercise as part of its economic reform program started in 1992. Although progress was initially slow, mainly due to the <b>inertia</b> associated with <b>start</b> up activities and generally opposition from interested parties 2, the program picked up momentum in the last two years, culminating in the rapid divestiture of public enterprises that many have compared only to privatization programs in eastern Europe. This paper reviews the privatization program in Zambia, highlighting the major tools and mechanisms employed, and the achievements and constraints faced by the authorities in privatizing one of the largest public sectors in Africa. The paper begins with a brief overview of the main economic issues surrounding moves towards privatization of public enterprises. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this project was to combine the ease-of-installation and ease-of-use {{attributes}} of industrial induction motors with the low-loss and small size and weight advantages of PM motors to create an ultra-efficient, high power density industrial motor that can be started across-the-line or operated from a standard, Volts/Hertz drive {{without the need for}} a rotor position feedback device. PM motor products that are currently available are largely variable speed motors that require a special adjustable speed drive with rotor position feedback. The reduced size and weight helps to offset the magnet cost in order make these motors commercially viable. The scope of this project covers horsepower ratings from 20 ? 500. Prototypes were built and tested at ratings ranging from 30 to 250 HP. Since fans, pumps and compressors make up a large portion of industrial motor applications, the motor characteristics are tailored to those applications. Also, since there is extensive use of adjustable frequency inverters in these applications, there is the opportunity to design for an optimal pole number and operate at other than 60 Hz frequency when inverters are utilized. Designs with four and eight pole configurations were prototyped as part of this work. Four pole motors are the most commonly used configuration in induction motors today. The results of the prototype design, fabrication, and testing were quite successful. The 50 HP rating met all of the design goals including efficiency and power density. Tested values of motor losses at 50 HP were 30 % lower than energy efficient induction motors and the motor weight is 35 % lower than the energy efficient induction motor of the same rating. Further, when tested at the 30 HP rating that is normally built in this 286 T frame size, the efficiency far exceeds the project design goals with 30 HP efficiency levels indicating a 55 % reduction in loss compared to energy efficient motors with a motor weight that is a few percentage points lower than the energy efficient motor. This 30 HP rating full load efficiency corresponds to a 46 % reduction in loss compared to a 30 HP NEMA Premium? efficient motor. The cost goals were to provide a two year or shorter efficiency-based payback of a price premium associated with the magnet cost in these motors. That goal is based on 24 / 7 operation with a cost of electricity of 10 cents per kW-hr. Similarly, the 250 HP prototype efficiency testing was quite successful. In this case, the efficiency was maximized with a slightly less aggressive reduction in active material. The measured full load efficiency of 97. 6 % represents in excess of a 50 % loss reduction compared to the equivalent NEMA Premium Efficiency induction motor. The active material weight reduction was a respectable 14. 5 % figure. This larger rating demonstrated both the scalability of this technology and also the ability to flexibly trade off power density and efficiency. In terms of starting performance, the 30 ? 50 HP prototypes were very extensively tested. The demonstrated capability included the ability to successfully start a load with an inertia of 25 times the motor?s own inertia while accelerating against a load torque following a fan profile at the motor?s full nameplate power rating. This capability will provide very wide applicability of this motor technology. The 250 HP prototype was also tested for starting characteristics, though without a coupled inertia and load torque. As a result it was not definitively proven that the same 25 times the motor?s own <b>inertia</b> could be <b>started</b> and synchronized successfully at 250 HP. Finite element modeling implies that this load could be successfully started, but it has not yet been confirmed by a test...|$|R
