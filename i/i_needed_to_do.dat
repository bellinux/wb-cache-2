After hearing a demo version of the track, she begged Iglesias to let her record the song, telling {{him that it was}} [...] "her song". Lopez, who was going through a divorce with Marc Anthony and the [...] "breakup of a family", felt as if the song had come to her at the [...] "perfect moment". According to Lopez, the period was devastating because family is very important to her. Lopez revealed: [...] "I had to turn that into something better"; she thought: [...] "I don't want to just survive it, I want to come out better than that." [...] Lopez didn't want to be [...] "the woman who stayed in bed for months". [...] "I knew I had to get through it. I'd dance every day, I'd work out, I'd say a little prayer and I still wouldn't feel any better. Then I'd go to bed and get up the next day and do it all again. It was a process, and it very gradually got a little easier ... I had to do it for my kids. I had to get through it for them." [...] She re-wrote parts of the verses to better relate to her experiences. The song [...] "helped lift her out of the darkness" [...] and gave her hope again. Looking back on the song in December 2012, Lopez stated that: [...] "'Dance Again' became my anthem ... an expression of what <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> at that time in my life and for what I was taking on with [...] It was a beautiful metaphor that became my reality." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 6 September 2010, Body Talk Pt. 2 was {{released}} in the UK. It was preceded by the lead single, a dance version of [...] "Hang with Me" [...] from Body Talk Pt. 1, on 5 September. The album includes a duet with American rapper Snoop Dogg, [...] "U Should Know Better". Robyn performed [...] "Dancing on My Own" [...] with deadmau5 at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards on 12 September. In a BBC Newsbeat interview, Robyn explained her decision to release three albums in one year: [...] "It was just something I felt like <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> I just never thought about selling records or not, making this decision. I just did it for myself. It's a way of, for me, to stay inspired {{and to be able}} to do the things I like to do". She said that she would not do it again: [...] "When you do 16 or 13 songs in one go, you kind of empty yourself, and it takes a while to fill back up and have new things to talk about, so I think it's good for everyone". Robyn announced the release of the single, [...] "Indestructible", on 13 October 2010; an acoustic version appeared on Body Talk Pt. 2. The song {{was released}} on 17 November in Scandinavia and 22 November in the UK. Co-written by Klas Åhlund, it was described as a [...] "pulsating full power version [...] takes every ounce of that emotion and wraps it up in another exceptional disco-pop record worthy of any dance-floor or passion-laden sing-a-long." [...] Robyn planned to collaborate with Swedish producer Max Martin on the song, [...] "Time Machine"; Martin produced Robyn's US singles [...] "Do You Know (What It Takes)" [...] and [...] "Show Me Love", both of which peaked in the top 10 on the Billboard 100 in 1997.

I also slept fairly well, as, indeed, <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> but my sleep was full of dreams of all the horrors and wonders I had undergone. Chiefly, however, I was haunted by that frightful piece of diablerie by which Ayesha left her finger-marks upon her rival's hair.

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Oral {{endocrine}} therapy (OET) {{is standard}} therapy {{for millions of}} estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer survivors (ER+BCS). OET reduces recurrence, mortality, and metastasis. ER+BCS often do not take their OET as recommended due to adverse side effects. The purpose of this dissertation was to develop an explanatory framework of decision making by women with ER+ breast cancer who report experiencing side effects from OET. This project was comprised of two components. The first component was a systematic review with three main findings: (1) side effects negatively impact OET non-adherence, (2) there is an absence of decisional supports provided to or available for ER+BCS who are experiencing OET side effects,, and (3) ER+BCS likely have unmet decisional <b>needs</b> related <b>to</b> OET. The second component was a grounded theory study that included 31 ER+BCS reporting OET side effects. During a single semi-structured interview, participants described the experience of OET over time. This study produced two qualitatively derived projects. First, a theoretical framework was developed that depicted four stages through which the experience of OET decision making unfolded. The stages were (1) being told what <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> live, (2) <b>doing</b> what <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> live, (3) enduring what <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> live, and (4) deciding how I want to live. Second, a typology was developed that depicted six sources of external decisional supports (healthcare providers, husbands, other breast cancer survivors, friends and family, the internet and other media sources, and God) that met four types of decisional needs (information about OET and its side effects, in-depth discussions about side effects, help in managing side effects, and emotional support). Findings {{can be used to}} develop interventions, such as decision aids, to promote quality decision making in women experiencing OET side effects. 1 yea...|$|R
