His medium was conditional colour pattern in oil and water colour which he augmented with various graphic techniques (<b>Indian</b> <b>ink,</b> <b>drawing,</b> linocut, woodcut). Over 40 of his oil paintings as well as around 150 of his water colours and drawings are exhibited at the Latvian State Museum of Art.|$|R

50|$|Knox Martin is {{best known}} for his {{repertory}} of signs and symbols that allude to nature and, in particular, to the female form. Flatly and freely painted in brilliant colors, his works have often been executed on a grand scale, as in the outdoor wall painting, Woman with bicycle, at West Houston and MacDougal Streets in Manhattan. He mostly creates painting, sculpture and wall paintings using media such as acrylic, collage, fresco, <b>ink</b> <b>drawing</b> (<b>Pen</b> and <b>Ink),</b> mixed media/multimedia, and oil.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good, that," [...] {{he said to}} himself, {{while her}} eyes rested upon him, black and impenetrable like the mental caverns where revolutionary thought should sit {{plotting}} the violent way of its dream of changes. As if anything could be changed! In this world of men nothing can be changed--neither happiness nor misery. They can only be displaced {{at the cost of}} corrupted consciences and broken lives--a futile game for arrogant philosophers and sanguinary triflers. Those thoughts darted through Razumov's head while he stood facing the old revolutionary hand, the respected, trusted, and influential Sophia Antonovna, whose word had such a weight in the [...] "active" [...] section of every party. She was much more representative than the great Peter Ivanovitch. Stripped of rhetoric, mysticism, and theories, she was the true spirit of destructive revolution. And she was the personal adversary he had to meet. It gave him a feeling of triumphant pleasure to deceive her out of her own mouth. The epigrammatic saying that speech has been given to us for the purpose of concealing our thoughts came into his mind. Of that cynical theory this was a very subtle and a very scornful application, flouting in its own words the very spirit of ruthless revolution, embodied in that woman with her white hair and black eyebrows, like slightly sinuous lines of <b>Indian</b> <b>ink,</b> <b>drawn</b> together by the perpendicular folds of a thoughtful frown.|$|R
5000|$|A {{fountain}} pen is a nib pen that, unlike its predecessor, the dip pen, contains an internal reservoir of liquid <b>ink.</b> The <b>pen</b> <b>draws</b> <b>ink</b> from the reservoir through a feed to the nib and deposits it on paper via {{a combination of}} gravity and capillary action. Filling the reservoir with ink may be achieved manually, via {{the use of a}} Pasteur pipette (eyedropper) or syringe, or via an internal filling mechanism which creates suction (for example, through a piston mechanism) to transfer ink directly through the nib into the reservoir. Some pens employ removable reservoirs in the form of pre-filled ink cartridges.|$|R

2500|$|Her {{fine art}} won awards for {{original}} designs in scratchboard, brush and <b>ink,</b> and <b>pen</b> <b>drawing.</b> [...] She experimented {{in a wide}} variety of media, and developed a style that is at once abstract and lyrical. Much of her art was intended and used to illustrate her published books of poetry. Some of her art pioneered a new technique created by her, which she called wax painting. It involves a controlled flow and manipulation of poured colored molten wax onto canvas, board, or paper. She also used techniques of cut paper and collage in her art, often supplemented by India ink and acrylics. The subjects she focused on in her art were drawn from her rich, symbolic imagination and dream life. She developed a preference for [...] "primitive" [...] art, whose unassuming simplicity she felt was capable of representing the images she wished to portray.|$|R

40|$|Recently, non-photorealistic image {{rendering}} (NPR) {{has become}} the subject {{of research and development}} by many researchers due to a rapid improvement in computer graphics. NPR has been used for communication by emphasizing an image or to simulate existing painting techniques. In this paper, we propose a generation method for <b>Indian</b> <b>ink</b> painting image which is an Oriental painting technique from two-dimensional realistic image. In general, <b>Indian</b> <b>ink</b> painting has three kinds of drawing techniques, “Senbyo “ technique to draw only contours of objects, “Mokkotu“ technique to draw only the interior of objects and “Senzen” technique to draw both contours and the interior of objects. In this paper, we simulate <b>Indian</b> <b>ink</b> painting by “Senzen” technique. We extract the contours from two-dimensional realistic image and decide the interior of the object in order to generate the image which is drawn by “Senzen” technique. The final image is generated by combining the inner area of the object with the contours. We generated several <b>Indian</b> <b>ink</b> painting images by our method. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective for <b>Indian</b> <b>ink</b> painting image rendering...|$|R

50|$|The {{traditional}} {{tools of}} the architect were the drawing board or draughting table, T-square and set squares, protractor, compasses, pencil and <b>drawing</b> <b>pens</b> of different types. Drawings were made on vellum, coated linen, and on tracing paper. Lettering would either be done by hand, mechanically using a stencil, {{or a combination of}} the two. <b>Ink</b> lines were <b>drawn</b> with a ruling pen, a relatively sophisticated device similar to a dip-in pen but with adjustable line width, capable of producing a very fine controlled line width. Ink pens had to be dipped into ink frequently. Draughtsmen worked standing up, and kept the ink on a separate table to avoid spilling <b>ink</b> on the <b>drawing.</b>|$|R
