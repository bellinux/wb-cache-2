25|$|A Snyder {{column is}} an {{extremely}} effective air-cooled column used in selected <b>fractional</b> <b>distillations.</b> It is a single glass tube {{with a series of}} circular indentations/restrictions in the walls of the cylinder (e.g., 3 or 6) in which rest, inverted, the same number of roughly tear-shaped, hollow, sealed glass stoppers; above each point where an inverted tear-shaped stopper rests, the cylinder has further Vigreux-type indentations, in this case serving to limit how high the glass stopper can be raised (by vapor flow) above its resting place, where, when not raised, it seals the circular opening created by the circular indentation. These floating glass stoppers act as check valves, closing and opening with vapor flow, and enhancing vapor-condensate mixing. A standard application of Snyder columns, is as the condenser/fractionation column above a Kuderna-Danish concentrator, used to efficiently separate a low boiling extraction solvent such as methylene chloride from volatile but higher boiling extract components (e.g., after the extraction of organic contaminants in soil).|$|R

40|$|The {{absorption}} cycle {{offers one}} of the most economic and widely applicable technologies for waste heat upgrading. It can use off-the-shelf hardware that is available now, at any required capacity rating. <b>Fractional</b> <b>distillations,</b> as a class of applications, embody characteristics that inherently make them economic candidates for absorption cycle heat upgrading. Practical applications to current U. S. distillations could save 30 trillion BTU per year, at payback periods ranging from 1 to 3 years. So, if the absorption cycle is so great, why isn't it more in use? There are three reasons: (1) lack of understanding of the basic principles and operation; (2) lack of guidelines for readily identifying attractive applications, and (3) lack of a commercial U. S. demonstration in the highly cost-effective distillation area. This paper presents absorption cycle fundamentals and applications guidelines, and announces a government-backed search for a site for commercial demonstration of the distillation energy savings. The guidelines provide a new tool for identifying attractive absorption cycle applications. They require only knowledge of process source and sink temperatures, and they show at a glance approximate component characteristics and payback period for the absorption cycle which would serve the application...|$|R

5|$|Xenon is {{obtained}} commercially as {{a by-product of}} the separation of air into oxygen and nitrogen. After this separation, generally performed by <b>fractional</b> <b>distillation</b> in a double-column plant, the liquid oxygen produced will contain small quantities of krypton and xenon. By additional <b>fractional</b> <b>distillation,</b> the liquid oxygen may be enriched to contain 0.1–0.2% of a krypton/xenon mixture, which is extracted either by absorption onto silica gel or by distillation. Finally, the krypton/xenon mixture may be separated into krypton and xenon by further distillation. Worldwide production of xenon in 1998 was estimated at 5,000–7,000m3. Because of its scarcity, xenon is much more expensive than the lighter noble gases—approximate prices for the purchase of small quantities in Europe in 1999 were 10€/L for xenon, 1€/L for krypton, and 0.20€/L for neon, while the much more plentiful argon costs less than a cent per liter.|$|E

Argon is also used in incandescent, fluorescent lighting, and other gas-discharge tubes. Argon makes a distinctive blue-green gas laser. Argon is also used in fluorescent glow starters.|$|E
40|$|The {{separation}} {{of the members of}} the paraffin series is the analysis of natural gas presents many difficulties. Chemical methods are of negligible value because of the close series relationship of the compounds. Combustion methods are fairly satisfactory for determining a mixture of two hydrocarbons, and theoretically can be used to determine a ternary mixture, but in the latter case it is impossible to attain an accuracy of any useful significance. Fractional combustion is of limited value: it permits the determination of H 2, CH 4, and C 2 H 6, but cannot separate the higher hydrocarbons. The use of physical properties, such as density, viscosity, and optical constants, is also limited to the determination of a mixture of two gases. The only methods of analysis in this field capable of making comprehensive and accurate determinations have depended upon some physical method of isolating the constituents and measuring them separately. <b>Fractional</b> <b>distillations</b> making use of the differences in boiling point between the members of the paraffin series require the use of temperatures low enough to liquefy the compounds to be separated. This suggests the advantageous procedure of employing temperatures at which the vapor pressures in question are very small, since the ratio between the vapor pressures of the successive paraffins increases as the pressures are reduced, increasing the degree of fractionation possible. In this manner Lebeau and Damiens fractionated natural gas into groups of two compounds, using single distillations. Later Burrell employed low temperatures obtained with liquid air to make analytical separations of natural gas into constituents as high as butane, making multiple distillations with recombination of fractions. His method was very slow, requiring as much as a week of pumping with a Toepler pump. Shepherd and Porter improved Burrell’s procedure in point of speed, reducing the pumping necessary by making distillations between three bulbs in series. Through the use of an evacuated apparatus entirely of glass with mercury filled gas lines they were able to separate natural gas with three distillations into (CH 4, N 2, H), C 2 H 6, C 3 H 6, C 3 H 8, C 4 H 10 and higher fraction to an accuracy of approximately 0. 1...|$|R
40|$|A {{procedure}} to obtain Biodiesel from &# 226;&# 128;&# 156;Oleinas&# 226;&# 128;&# 157; is studied. Biodiesel is a suitable product to replace diesel oil currently used {{to power the}} Diesel engines. It consists of a mixture of methyl esters of the fatty acids presents as triglycerides in vegetables oils (olive, sunflower, soya, rape oils). As {{a result of the}} refining of these oils for their use as food, a waste product is formed, the &# 226;&# 128;&# 156;oleinas&# 226;&# 128;&# 157; (acidulated soapstock). The oleinas consist of a mixture of triglycerides and free fatty acids, the latter amounting to 50 % or more of the mixture and are subject to a fluctuating market, therefore it exist at times a problem for their disposal. In our research work we have tried to obtain biodiesel from oleinas. The process resulting from our experimental work is as follows: 1. Sterification of the free fatty acids with methanol, by acid catalysis, centrifuging the reaction product and removal of the acid-methanol phase. Drying of the latter. At this stage we have a product containing about 70 % of methyl esters. 2. Transesterification of the triglycerides present in the sterified product with methanol by alkaline catalysis, washing the reaction product with a water methanol solution. Centrifuging and removal of the water-methanol phase. At this stage a biodiesel product is obtained containing about 90 % of methyl esters. 3. <b>Fractional</b> vacuum <b>distillation</b> of the 90 % biodiesel gives a final product with a methyl esters content higher than 98 %.

30|$|Titanium dioxide is {{the most}} widely used white pigment because of its {{brightness}} and very high refractive index, in which it is surpassed only by a few other materials. TiO 2 is unique because it efficiently scatters visible light, thereby imparting whiteness, brightness, and opacity when incorporated into a coating. Dry compacted TiO 2 samples are characterized by their brightness and whiteness and exhibit reflectance properties approaching that of the perfect reflecting diffuser. ‘Color’ is carefully controlled during the TiO 2 manufacturing process through the removal of the trace amounts of metal oxide contaminants. These light-absorbing contaminants will detract from the brightness and whiteness of the pigment and can affect the appearance of white and near-white paints containing that pigment. The opacity of white pigments mainly derives from the scattering, while the opacity of black pigments is a result of absorption ability[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. It was observed that if the TiO 2 is produced in a commercial production plant on particular days when there is oil leak in the larox filter, the color and brightness of the produced pigment failed when measured the same in acrylic lacquer paint (vehicle b). Also, this failure is not seen when the color and brightness are measured in dry mode (dry b). These observations were not a single case but were seen occasionally in the quality analysis. The failure in the vehicle color, once commenced, was seen continued consecutively with three to four final products. The sources of oil contamination during the manufacturing process can be as follows: In the chloride process of manufacturing TiO 2, rutile or high-grade ilmenite is converted to titanium tetrachloride (TiCl 4) gas. The conversion takes place in a chlorinator (i.e., fluidized bed reactor) in the presence of chlorine gas at 850 °C to 950 °C, with petroleum coke added as a reductant. The chief reaction products are volatile metal chlorides, including TiCl 4, which are collected. The nonvolatile chlorides and the unreacted solids that remain in the chlorinator are wasted, forming the special waste stream ‘chloride process waste solids’. The gaseous raw product stream is purified to separate the titanium tetrachloride from other chlorides. Separation is by <b>fractional</b> condensation, double <b>distillation,</b> and chemical treatment. Ferric chloride (FeCl 3) is removed as a major acidic liquid waste stream through fractional condensation. Additional trace metal chlorides are removed through double distillation. Finally, vanadium oxychloride (VOCl 3), which has a boiling point close to that of TiCl 4 (136 °C), is removed as a low-volume non-special waste by complexing with mineral oil and reduced with hydrogen sulfide to VOCl 2 or by complexing with copper. The purified TiCl 4 is then oxidized to TiO 2 at 985 °C, driving off chlorine gas, which is recycled to the chlorinator. Aluminum chloride is added in the oxidation step to promote formation of the rutile crystal which is the TiO 2 product. The next stage of TiO 2 manufacturing is surface treatment, where the TiO 2 from oxidizer is converted to slurry in water, which is then subjected to sand milling to the required particle size. The clarified slurry from the sand mill is treated with alumina or zirconia for coating the surface of bare titanium dioxide with amorphous aluminum or zirconium oxide. The surface-treated product is then filtered through larox by pressing and followed by organic treatment and spin flash drying. Finally, the dried product is subjected to micronization process to get the surface-treated product. The brightness and color of this product is important for its marketing.|$|R

5|$|Helium is {{the second}} lightest element and {{is the second}} most {{abundant}} in the observable universe. Most helium was formed during the Big Bang, but new helium is being created {{as a result of the}} nuclear fusion of hydrogen in stars. On Earth, helium is relatively rare and is created by the natural decay of some radioactive elements because the alpha particles that are emitted consist of helium nuclei. This radiogenic helium is trapped with natural gas in concentrations of up to seven percent by volume, from which it is extracted commercially by a low-temperature separation process called <b>fractional</b> <b>distillation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Neon, argon, krypton, and xenon are {{obtained}} from air using {{the methods of}} liquefaction of gases, to convert elements to a liquid state, and <b>fractional</b> <b>distillation,</b> to separate mixtures into component parts. Helium is typically produced by separating it from natural gas, and radon is isolated from the radioactive decay of radium compounds. The prices of the noble gases are influenced by their natural abundance, with argon being the cheapest and xenon the most expensive. As an example, the adjacent table lists the 2004 prices in the United States for laboratory quantities of each gas.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen gas is an {{industrial}} gas {{produced by the}} <b>fractional</b> <b>distillation</b> of liquid air, or by mechanical means using gaseous air (pressurised reverse osmosis membrane or pressure swing adsorption). Nitrogen gas generators using membranes or pressure swing adsorption (PSA) are typically more cost and energy efficient than bulk delivered nitrogen. Commercial nitrogen is often a byproduct of air-processing for industrial concentration of oxygen for steelmaking and other purposes. When supplied compressed in cylinders it is often called OFN (oxygen-free nitrogen). Commercial-grade nitrogen already contains at most 20ppm oxygen, and specially purified grades containing at most 2ppm oxygen and 10ppm argon are also available.|$|E
5|$|Because it {{cannot be}} readily {{produced}} {{by reduction of}} its dioxide, titanium metal is obtained by reduction of TiCl4 with magnesium metal in the Kroll process. The complexity of this batch production in the Kroll process explains the relatively high market value of titanium, despite the Kroll process being less expensive than the Hunter process. To produce the TiCl4 required by the Kroll process, the dioxide is subjected to carbothermic reduction {{in the presence of}} chlorine. In this process, the chlorine gas is passed over a red-hot mixture of rutile or ilmenite in the presence of carbon. After extensive purification by <b>fractional</b> <b>distillation,</b> the TiCl4 is reduced with 800°C molten magnesium in an argon atmosphere. Titanium metal can be further purified by the van Arkel–de Boer process, which involves thermal decomposition of titanium tetraiodide.|$|E
5|$|For {{large-scale}} use, helium {{is extracted}} by <b>fractional</b> <b>distillation</b> from natural gas, which can contain {{as much as}} 7% helium. Since helium has a lower boiling point than any other element, low temperature and high pressure are used to liquefy nearly all the other gases (mostly nitrogen and methane). The resulting crude helium gas is purified by successive exposures to lowering temperatures, in which {{almost all of the}} remaining nitrogen and other gases are precipitated out of the gaseous mixture. Activated charcoal is used as a final purification step, usually resulting in 99.995% pure Grade-A helium. The principal impurity in Grade-A helium is neon. In a final production step, most of the helium that is produced is liquefied via a cryogenic process. This is necessary for applications requiring liquid helium and also allows helium suppliers to reduce the cost of long distance transportation, as the largest liquid helium containers have more than five times the capacity of the largest gaseous helium tube trailers.|$|E
5|$|On Earth it is {{relatively}} rare—5.2 ppm by volume in the atmosphere. Most terrestrial helium present today is created by the natural radioactive decay of heavy radioactive elements (thorium and uranium, although there are other examples), as the alpha particles emitted by such decays consist of helium-4 nuclei. This radiogenic helium is trapped with natural gas in concentrations as great as 7% by volume, from which it is extracted commercially by a low-temperature separation process called <b>fractional</b> <b>distillation.</b> Previously, terrestrial helium—a non-renewable resource, because once released into the atmosphere it readily escapes into space—was thought to be in increasingly short supply. However, recent studies suggest that helium produced deep in the earth by radioactive decay can collect in natural gas reserves in larger than expected quantities, in some cases having been released by volcanic activity.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of pure alkali metals is somewhat complicated {{due to their}} extreme reactivity with commonly used substances, such as water. From their silicate ores, all the stable alkali metals may be obtained the same way: sulfuric acid is first used to dissolve the desired alkali metal ion and aluminium(III) ions from the ore (leaching), whereupon basic precipitation removes aluminium ions from the mixture by precipitating it as the hydroxide. The remaining insoluble alkali metal carbonate is then precipitated selectively; the salt is then dissolved in hydrochloric acid to produce the chloride. The result is then left to evaporate and the alkali metal can then be isolated. Lithium and sodium are typically isolated through electrolysis from their liquid chlorides, with calcium chloride typically added to lower the melting point of the mixture. The heavier alkali metals, however, is more typically isolated in a different way, where a reducing agent (typically sodium for potassium and magnesium or calcium for the heaviest alkali metals) is used to reduce the alkali metal chloride. The liquid or gaseous product (the alkali metal) then undergoes <b>fractional</b> <b>distillation</b> for purification.|$|E
5|$|The heavy isotope 15N {{was first}} {{discovered}} by S. M. Naudé in 1929, soon after heavy isotopes of the neighbouring elements oxygen and carbon were discovered. It presents {{one of the}} lowest thermal neutron capture cross-sections of all isotopes. It is frequently used in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine the structures of nitrogen-containing molecules, due to its fractional nuclear spin of one-half, which offers advantages for NMR such as narrower line width. 14N, though also theoretically usable, has an integer nuclear spin of one and thus has a quadrupole moment that leads to wider and less useful spectra. 15N NMR nevertheless has complications not encountered in the more 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The low natural abundance of 15N (0.36%) significantly reduces sensitivity, a problem which is only exacerbated by its low gyromagnetic ratio, (only 10.14% that of 1H). As a result, the signal-to-noise ratio for 1H is about 300 times as much as that for 15N at the same magnetic field strength. This may be somewhat alleviated by isotopic enrichment of 15N by chemical exchange or <b>fractional</b> <b>distillation.</b> 15N-enriched compounds have the advantage that under standard conditions, they do not undergo chemical exchange of their nitrogen atoms with atmospheric nitrogen, unlike compounds with labelled hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen isotopes that must be kept away from the atmosphere. The 15N:14N ratio is commonly used in stable isotope analysis in the fields of geochemistry, hydrology, paleoclimatology and paleoceanography, where it is called δ15N.|$|E
