5|$|In 1905 the USDA {{initiated}} {{its first}} large-scale biological control program, sending entomologists to Europe and Japan {{to look for}} natural enemies of the <b>gypsy</b> <b>moth,</b> Lymantria dispar dispar, and brown-tail moth, Euproctis chrysorrhoea, invasive pests of trees and shrubs. As a result, nine parasitoids (solitary wasps) of <b>gypsy</b> <b>moth,</b> seven of brown-tail moth, and two predators of both moths became established in the USA. Although the <b>gypsy</b> <b>moth</b> was not fully controlled by these natural enemies, the frequency, duration, and severity of its outbreaks were reduced and the program was regarded as successful. This program also {{led to the development}} of many concepts, principles, and procedures for the implementation of biological control programs.|$|E
5|$|A <b>gypsy</b> <b>moth</b> {{infestation}} {{began on}} Nescopeck Mountain {{in the summer}} of 2014, causing hundreds of trees to be defoliated. The Bureau of Forestry expects to begin spraying the area in May 2015 and June 2015.|$|E
5|$|Starting in the mid-1940s, Carson {{had become}} {{concerned}} {{about the use of}} synthetic pesticides, many of which had been developed through the military funding of science since World War II. It was the US federal government's 1957 <b>gypsy</b> <b>moth</b> eradication program, however, that prompted Carson to devote her research, and her next book, to pesticides and environmental poisons. The <b>gypsy</b> <b>moth</b> program involved aerial spraying of DDT and other pesticides (mixed with fuel oil), including the spraying of private land. Landowners on Long Island filed a suit to have the spraying stopped, and many in affected regions followed the case closely. Though the suit was lost, the Supreme Court granted petitioners the right to gain injunctions against potential environmental damage in the future; this laid the basis for later successful environmental actions.|$|E

25|$|Forest {{defoliation}} by the <b>gypsy</b> <b>moths</b> {{each year}} affects the populations and reproductive success of forest-dwelling birds. Nests placed in defoliated sites suffered a higher predation rate {{than those in}} non-defoliated sites. <b>Gypsy</b> <b>moths</b> have {{a direct impact on}} avian behavior in the American forests.|$|R

5|$|Baculoviruses are {{specific}} to individual insect host species and {{have been shown to}} be useful in biological pest control. For example, the Lymantria dispar multicapsid nuclear polyhedrosis virus has been used to spray large areas of forest in North America where larvae of the <b>gypsy</b> <b>moth</b> are causing serious defoliation. The moth larvae are killed by the virus they have eaten and die, the disintegrating cadavers leaving virus particles on the foliage to infect other larvae.|$|E
5|$|Fishers, {{medium-sized}} weasels, were reintroduced to Pine Creek Gorge {{as part of}} {{an effort}} to establish a healthy population of fishers in Pennsylvania. Prior to the lumber era, fishers were numerous throughout the forests of Pennsylvania. They are generalized predators and will hunt any smaller creatures in their territory, including porcupines. Elk have been reintroduced west of the gorge in Clinton County and occasionally wander near the west rim of the canyon. Coyotes have come back on their own. Invasive insect species in the gorge include <b>gypsy</b> <b>moth</b> larvae, which eat all the leaves off trees, especially oaks, and hemlock woolly adelgids, which weaken and kill hemlocks. Invasive plant species include purple loosestrife and Japanese knotweed.|$|E
5|$|Forests cover 65% of the state, {{primarily}} with deciduous, broad leaf {{trees in the}} western part of the state and evergreens and conifers dominant the central and eastern part of Virginia. Lower altitudes are more likely to have small but dense stands of moisture-loving hemlocks and mosses in abundance, with hickory and oak in the Blue Ridge. However, since the early 1990s, <b>Gypsy</b> <b>moth</b> infestations have eroded the dominance of oak forests. In the lowland tidewater and piedmont, yellow pines tend to dominate, with bald cypress wetland forests in the Great Dismal and Nottoway swamps. Other common trees and plants include red bay, wax myrtle, dwarf palmetto, tulip poplar, mountain laurel, milkweed, daisies, and many species of ferns. The largest areas of wilderness are along the Atlantic coast and in the western mountains, where the largest populations of trillium wildflowers in North America are found. The Atlantic coast regions are host to flora commonly associated with the South Atlantic pine forests and lower Southeast Coastal Plain maritime flora, the latter found primarily in eastern and central Virginia.|$|E

25|$|The <b>gypsy</b> <b>moth</b> habitat {{overlaps}} {{with the northern}} tiger swallowtail, Papilio canadensis. Experiments indicate that known <b>gypsy</b> <b>moth</b> pathogens and <b>gypsy</b> <b>moth</b> bodily fluid negatively affect the survival of swallowtail larvae. <b>Gypsy</b> <b>moth</b> bodily fluid is lethal and swallowtail caterpillars were prone to higher rates of parasitism when placed in the field near <b>gypsy</b> <b>moth</b> infestations.|$|E
25|$|Four {{species of}} {{parasitic}} flies prey on <b>gypsy</b> <b>moth</b> larva. Parasetigana silvestris and Exorista larvarum lays an egg on the <b>gypsy</b> <b>moth</b> larva. If that egg hatches before the <b>gypsy</b> <b>moth</b> larva molts, the fly larva will penetrate the host. Compsilura concinnata pierces the <b>gypsy</b> <b>moth</b> larva and deposits its own larva inside. Blepharipa pratensis, lays its eggs on leaves, the <b>gypsy</b> <b>moth</b> larva will consume {{the egg and}} the fly larva will hatch inside its gut.|$|E
25|$|Lymantria dispar dispar, {{commonly}} known as the <b>gypsy</b> <b>moth,</b> European <b>gypsy</b> <b>moth,</b> or North American <b>gypsy</b> <b>moth,</b> is a moth in the family Erebidae that is of Eurasian origin. It has a range which covers Europe, Africa, and North America.|$|E
5000|$|Threats to the {{persistence}} of barrens dagger moths include habitat loss, fire suppression, extensive fires, high levels of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) browsing, introduced species, insecticides, off-road vehicles, and light pollution. Introduced species that may negatively impact barrens dagger <b>moth</b> are <b>gypsy</b> <b>moths</b> (Lymantria dispar) and parasitoids such as compsilura (Compsilura concinnata). Spraying for mosquitoes (Culicidae) and <b>gypsy</b> <b>moths</b> could negatively impact barrens dagger moth. Since {{it is not as}} persistent as other insecticides, use of the insecticide Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki in spring is recommended if severe defoliation by <b>gypsy</b> <b>moths</b> appears imminent. White-tailed deer damage {{may have contributed to the}} extirpation of the barrens dagger moth population at Pinery Park, Ontario [...]|$|R

50|$|After {{its initial}} showings, {{the film was}} {{lengthened}} to 110 minutes and the rating changed to M for mature audiences. This rating was {{an early version of}} the later R. As soon as it appeared, The <b>Gypsy</b> <b>Moths</b> disappeared. Director Frankenheimer claimed the film did not get the same attention as his thrillers, like Seconds (1966) and The Manchurian Candidate (1962). Despite this, he would call The <b>Gypsy</b> <b>Moths</b> one of his two favorite films.|$|R
25|$|For the {{purposes}} of taxonomy, the common names North American <b>gypsy</b> <b>moth</b> and European <b>gypsy</b> <b>moth</b> represent the same subspecies, Lymantria dispar dispar, as opposed to subspecies of Lymantria dispar from Asia.|$|E
25|$|Many {{bird species}} feed on <b>gypsy</b> <b>moth</b> larvae, {{but they are}} not a major food in the diet of any common bird species. Although a few European studies cite avian {{predation}} as a large influence in keeping the <b>gypsy</b> <b>moth</b> population in control, few studies exist to prove it.|$|E
25|$|Many {{species have}} been {{identified}} as preying on L. dispar. Some species, such as the white-footed mouse or Anastaus disparis, {{have a significant impact on}} the <b>gypsy</b> <b>moth</b> population dynamics. On the other hand, avian predation and invertebrate predation show only small effects on the population dynamics of the <b>gypsy</b> <b>moth.</b>|$|E

25|$|Eight {{species of}} {{parasitic}} wasps attack the <b>gypsy</b> <b>moth.</b> Ooencyrtus kuvanae and Anastatus disparis attack the eggs. Ooencyrtus kuvanae attacks the eggs, but the effectiveness {{is limited by}} the ovipositor which can only penetrate the surface layer of the egg cluster. Anastatus disparis has limited success as a predator because it can only attack unembroyonated eggs and the female wasps do not have wings.Even so, Anastatus disparis is the only species that is known to occasionally affect the population dynamics of the <b>gypsy</b> <b>moth.</b> Apanteles melanoscelus and Phobocampe disparis parasitize the early larva stages. Brachymeria intermedia and Monodontomerus aureus parasitize the <b>gypsy</b> <b>moth</b> pupae.|$|E

30|$|Radiata pine is {{native to}} California but has been widely planted for {{commercial}} forestry elsewhere, especially in the southern hemisphere. In the Northern Iberian Peninsula, extensive planting began {{in the in the}} 1950 s (Mead 2013). Plantations in this region, along with those in other southern European countries, are the only areas where both radiata pine and European <b>gypsy</b> <b>moths</b> overlap, since the insect is absent in the southern hemisphere and radiata pine is virtually absent from <b>gypsy</b> <b>moth’s</b> invaded range in North America.|$|R

25|$|As {{noted in}} The <b>Gypsy</b> <b>Moth</b> (1896) by Forbush and Fernald, the <b>gypsy</b> <b>moth</b> was {{considered}} a nuisance just ten years after their release. The first major outbreak occurred in 1889, and Forbush and Fernald recount the extent of devastation: all the trees being defoliated and caterpillars covering houses and sidewalks and raining down upon residents. At first it was uncertain what species {{was responsible for the}} outbreak, but after the caterpillar was identified by entomologist Maria Elizabeth Fernald, an eradication program began in 1890.|$|E
25|$|Most moths are nocturnal or crepuscular {{while most}} {{butterflies}} are diurnal. There are however exceptions, including the sometimes-diurnal <b>gypsy</b> <b>moth</b> and the spectacular Uraniidae or sunset moths.|$|E
25|$|In {{the eastern}} US, the <b>gypsy</b> <b>moth</b> prefers oaks, aspen, apple, sweetgum, {{speckled}} alder, basswood, gray birch, paper birch, poplar, willow, and hawthorns, among other species. Older larvae feed on {{several species of}} softwood that younger larvae avoid, including cottonwood, hemlock, Atlantic white cypress, and pine and spruce species native to the east. The <b>gypsy</b> <b>moth</b> avoids ash trees, tulip-tree, American sycamore, butternut, black walnut, catalpa, flowering dogwood, balsam fir, cedar, American holly, and mountain laurel and rhododendron shrubs, but will feed on these in late instars when densities are extremely high.|$|E
