25|$|The first {{production}} night fighter Mosquitos - minus turrets - {{were designated}} NF Mk II. A total of 466 were built {{with the first}} entering service with No. 157 Squadron in January 1942, replacing the Douglas Havoc. These aircraft were similar to the F Mk II, but were fitted with the AI Mk IV metric wavelength radar. The <b>herring-bone</b> transmitting antenna was mounted on the nose and the dipole receiving antennae were carried under the outer wings. A number of NF IIs had their radar equipment removed and additional fuel tanks installed in the bay behind the cannon for use as night intruders. These aircraft, designated NF II (Special) were first used by 23 Squadron in operations over Europe in 1942. 23 Squadron was then deployed to Malta on 20 December 1942, and operated against targets in Italy.|$|E

40|$|The Himmelbaach quarry {{is located}} in the Wiltz Synclinorium in Luxembourg. The rocks {{outcropping}} in this quarry correspond to the mid-Emsian Clervaux Shales Formation. Three different facies have been identified in the quarry. An argillaceous sandstone facies with oblique stratifications, cross-stratifications, <b>herring-bones</b> and erosive bases represent the first facies; the second facies is characterized by lenticular- (with connected lenses) to wavy-bedded sandy argillites, argillaceous sandstones and quartz arenites. The last facies corresponds to a quartz arenite with oblique stratification, planar laminations and mud drapes. The base of this facies shows flaser bedding and sigmoidally curved bed surfaces. The palaeoenvironmental study of this area is rather difficult because of the structural deformation and lateral variation of the facies. Due to this deformation, six partial sections (4 a to 4 f) were sampled here. In order to reconstruct a reliable vertical and lateral succession of the depositional setting, facies analysis and magnetic susceptibility were used. Magnetic susceptibility (MS) is generally applied as a tool for correlation in a deepwater carbonated environment. In this paper we used the MS technique successfully in a siliciclastic proximal setting. Analysis of MS curves as well as the recognition of three marker beds ((1) the last bed of argillaceous sandstones in Facies 1; (2) a thin horizon of carbonated sandstone within Facies 2; (3) the first appearance of the characteristics massive quartzitic beds in Facies 3) allowed the correlation of sections 4 a, 4 b and 4 c. These correlations helped us to reconstruct a vertical and lateral succession of facies, which ultimately led to the recognition of a tide-dominated marginal-marine depositional model composed respectively of tidal channels (Facies 1), a tidal flat (Facies 2) and a tidal sand ridge (Facies 3). This example also shows the usefulness of magnetic susceptibility for small scale correlation, even in a proximal environment such as a marginal-marine setting. Peer reviewe...|$|R

60|$|The {{next evening}} found them {{treading}} resolutely the <b>herring-bone</b> {{walk through the}} tiny garden. The April wind was filling the pine trees with its roundelay, and the grove was alive with robins--great, plump, saucy fellows, strutting along the paths. The girls rang rather timidly, and were admitted by a grim and ancient handmaiden. The door opened directly into a large living-room, where by a cheery little fire sat two other ladies, {{both of whom were}} also grim and ancient. Except that one looked to be about seventy and the other fifty, there seemed little difference between them. Each had amazingly big, light-blue eyes behind steel-rimmed spectacles; each wore a cap and a gray shawl; each was knitting without haste and without rest; each rocked placidly and looked at the girls without speaking; and just behind each sat a large white china dog, with round green spots all over it, a green nose and green ears. Those dogs captured Anne's fancy on the spot; they seemed like the twin guardian deities of Patty's Place.|$|E
60|$|They {{saw it as}} {{they walked}} up the pine-fringed hill from the park. Just on the crest, where Spofford Avenue petered out into a plain road, was a little white frame house with groups of pines {{on either side of}} it, {{stretching}} their arms protectingly over its low roof. It was covered with red and gold vines, through which its green-shuttered windows peeped. Before it was a tiny garden, surrounded by a low stone wall. October though it was, the garden was still very sweet with dear, old-fashioned, unworldly flowers and shrubs--sweet may, southern-wood, lemon verbena, alyssum, petunias, marigolds and chrysanthemums. A tiny brick wall, in <b>herring-bone</b> pattern, led from the gate to the front porch. The whole place might have been transplanted from some remote country village; yet there was something about it that made its nearest neighbor, the big lawn-encircled palace of a tobacco king, look exceedingly crude and showy and ill-bred by contrast. As Phil said, it was the difference between being born and being made.|$|E
6000|$|In the fresco, No. 170, we {{have the}} {{representation}} of a river with papyrus on its bank. Here the water is rendered by zigzag lines arranged vertically and in parallel lines, so as to resemble <b>herring-bone</b> masonry, thus. There are fish in this fresco as in the preceding, and in both each fish is drawn very distinctly, not as it would appear to the eye viewed through water. The mode of representing this element in Egyptian painting is further abbreviated in their hieroglyphic writing, where the sign of water is a zigzag line; this line is, so to speak, a picture of water written in short hand. In the Egyptian Pantheon there was but one aquatic deity, {{the god of the}} Nile; his type is, therefore, the only figurative representation of water in Egyptian art. (Birch, [...] "Gallery of British Museum Antiquities," [...] Pl. 13.) In Assyrian sculpture we have very curious conventionally imitative representations of water. On several of the friezes from Nimroud and Khorsabad, men are seen crossing a river in boats, or in skins, accompanied by horses swimming (see Layard, ii. p. 381). In these scenes water is represented by masses of wavy lines somewhat resembling tresses of hair, and terminating in curls or volutes; these wavy lines express the general character of a deep and rapid current, like that of the Tigris. Fish are but sparingly introduced, the idea of surface being sufficiently expressed by the floating figures and boats. In the representation of these there is the same want of perspective as in the Egyptian fresco which we have just cited.|$|E
60|$|Anyone {{who will}} look through a {{collection}} of Australian weapons and utensils {{will be brought to}} this conclusion. The shields and the clubs are elaborately worked, but almost always without any representation of plants, animals, or the human figure. As a rule the decorations take the simple shape of the 'herring-bone' pattern, or such other patterns as can be produced without the aid of spirals, or curves, or circles. There is a natural and necessary cause of this choice of decoration. The Australians, working on hard wood, with tools made of flint, or broken glass, or sharp shell, cannot easily produce any curved lines. Everyone who, when a boy, carved his name on the bark of a tree, remembers the difficulty he had with S and G, while he got on easily with letters like M and A, which consist of straight or inclined lines. The savage artist has the same difficulty with his rude tools in producing anything like satisfactory curves or spirals. We engrave above (Fig. 1) a shield on which an Australian has succeeded, with obvious difficulty, in producing concentric ovals of irregular shape. It may be that the artist would have produced perfect circles if he could. His failure is exactly like that of a youthful carver of inscriptions coming to grief over his G's and S's. Here, however (Fig. 2), we have three shields which, like the ancient Celtic pipkin (the tallest of the three figures in Fig. 3), show the earliest known form of savage decorative art--the forms which survive under the names of 'chevron' and 'herring-bone.' These can be scratched on clay with the nails, or a sharp stick, and this primeval way of decorating pottery made without the wheel survives, with other relics of savage art, in the western isles of Scotland. The Australian had not even learned to make rude clay pipkins, but he decorated his shields as the old Celts and modern old Scotch women decorated their clay pots, with the <b>herring-bone</b> arrangement of incised lines. In the matter of colour the Australians prefer white clay and red ochre, which they rub into the chinks in the woodwork of their shields. When they are determined on an ambush, they paint themselves all over with white, justly conceiving that their sudden apparition in this guise will strike terror into the boldest hearts. But arrangements in black and white of this sort scarcely deserve the name of even rudimentary art.|$|E
