25|$|In {{supporting}} an Austrian {{war with}} Serbia, Germany's leaders knew {{the risks of}} a general war. As the historian Fritz Fischer pointed out, this could be proven by Jagow's request to know the full itinerary of Wilhelm's North Sea cruise before the Austrian ultimatum was presented because:"Since we want to localize the conflict between Austria and Serbia, we must not have the world alarmed by His Majesty’s returning prematurely; on the other hand, His Majesty must be within reach, in case unpredictable developments should <b>force</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> take important decisions, such as mobilization.

Second, it <b>forces</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> think about them as embodied, material processes. The concrete ways in which this tension pans out cannot be known in the abstract or a priori – they must be studied in concrete settings, as they play out in different historical moments, geographical contexts and in relation to different individuals or social groups.

25|$|Face {{recognition}} {{technology can}} be used to gain access to a person's private data, according to a new study. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University combined image scanning, cloud computing and public profiles from social network sites to identify individuals in the offline world. Data captured even included a user's social security number. Experts have warned of the privacy risks faced by the increased merging of our online and offline identities. The researchers have also developed an 'augmented reality' mobile app that can display personal data over a person's image captured on a smartphone screen. Since these technologies are widely available, our future identities may become exposed to anyone with a smartphone and an Internet connection. Researchers believe this could <b>force</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> reconsider our future attitudes to privacy.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the main}} {{characters}} of McCarthyism was John Peurifoy, who was sent as the ambassador of the United States to Guatemala, as {{this was the first}} country in the American sphere of influence after World War II that included elements openly communists in his government. He came from Greece, where he had already done considerable anticommunist activity, and was installed as ambassador in November 1953, when Carlos Castillo Armas was already organizing his tiny revoucionary army. After a long meeting, Peurifoy made it clear to President Arbenz that the US was worried about the communist elements in his government, and then reported to the Department of State that the Guatemalan leader was not a communist, but that surely a Communist leader would come after him; furthermore, in January 1954 he told Time magazine: American public opinion could <b>force</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> take some measures to prevent Guatemala from falling into the orbit of international communism.|$|E

500|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} its initial publication, The Fountainhead has received relatively little attention from literary critics. Assessing the novel's legacy, philosopher Douglas Den Uyl described The Fountainhead as relatively neglected compared to her later novel, Atlas Shrugged, and said, [...] "our problem is to find those topics that arise clearly with The Fountainhead and yet do not <b>force</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> read it simply {{through the eyes of}} Atlas Shrugged." [...] Among critics who have addressed it, some consider The Fountainhead to be Rand's best novel, although in some cases this assessment is tempered by an overall negative judgment of Rand's writings. Purely negative evaluations have also continued; a 2011 overview of American literature said [...] "mainstream literary culture dismissed [...] in the 1940s and continues to dismiss it".|$|E
500|$|In {{speculative}} fiction, extrapolation allows {{writers to}} focus {{not on the}} way things are (or were), as non-genre literature does, but on the way things could be different. It provides science fiction with a quality that science fiction critic Darko Suvin has called [...] "cognitive estrangement": the recognition that what we are reading is not the world as we know it, but a world whose differences <b>force</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> reconsider our own with an outsider's perspective. When the extrapolation involves sexuality or gender, it can force the reader to reconsider his or her heteronormative cultural assumptions; the freedom to imagine societies different from real-life cultures makes SF an effective tool for examining sexual bias. In science fiction, such estranging features include technologies that significantly alter sex or reproduction. In fantasy, such features include figures such as mythological deities and heroic archetypes, who are not limited by preconceptions of human sexuality and gender, allowing them to be reinterpreted. SF has also depicted a plethora of alien methods of reproduction and sex, some of which can be viewed as homo- or bisexual through a human binary-gender lens.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Newport (Ymerodraeth State of Mind)" [...] parodies the song, {{replacing}} {{references to the}} [...] "Empire State" [...] of New York with of the smaller Welsh city of Newport. In the Welsh language Ymerodraeth means [...] "empire". [...] "Newport (Ymerodraeth State of Mind)" [...] was directed by British filmmaker M-J Delaney and featured London-based actors Alex Warren and Terema Wainwright, rapping and singing respectively. Days after its release Delaney said: [...] "I hope Jay-Z and Alicia {{get to see the}} video as long as their publishing people don't <b>force</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> take it offline. It's only tongue in cheek." [...] Its participants were invited to appear on national television news and their work was reported in national newspapers. Their work was also so well received in Wales that they were invited to the reopening of the Newport Transporter Bridge. It achieved viral video status when it reached nearly a million hits in 3 days and, by August 2010, nearly 2.5million people had watched it on YouTube. In July both Warren and Wainwright met with Universal Records (the music publishers) to discuss releasing the track as a single, with some of the proceeds going to the mental health charity Newport Mind. But the seven co-writers of [...] "Empire State of Mind" [...] refused to give permission for the Newport single, a situation which led to the video being removed from YouTube on August 10.|$|E

In December, he received particularly alarming letters from Richard Cobden and John Bright. [...] Bright and Cobden discussed the preparations of the government for war and the widespread doubts, including their own, of the legality of Wilkes' actions.

2500|$|Neuroethics {{encompasses}} {{a wide range}} of issues, which can only be sampled here.

[...] For example, how should incidental findings be handled when a presumed healthy research subject is scanned for neuroscience research and the scan reveals an abnormality? [...] How safe are the drugs used to enhance normal brain function? [...] These are neuroethical issues with clear precedents in traditional bioethics. [...] They are important issues, and luckily we can call upon society's experience with the relevant precedents to help determine the best courses of action in the present cases. [...] In contrast, many neuroethical issues are at least partly novel, and this accounts for some of the intellectual fascination of neuroethics.

2500|$|Some of the {{consonant}} shifts {{resulting from}} {{the second and third}} phases appear also to be observable in Lombardic, the early mediaeval Germanic language of Italy, which is preserved in runic fragments of the late 6th and early 7th centuries. However, the Lombardic records are not sufficient to allow a complete taxonomy of the language. It is therefore uncertain whether the language experienced the full shift or merely sporadic reflexes, but b > p is clearly attested. [...] This may mean that the shift began in Italy, or that it spread southwards as well as northwards. [...] Ernst Schwarz and others have suggested that the shift occurred in German as a result of contacts with Lombardic. [...] If, in fact, there is a relationship here, the evidence of Lombardic would <b>force</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> conclude that the third phase must have begun by the late 6th century, rather earlier than most estimates, but this would not necessarily require that it had spread to German so early.|$|E

2500|$|Lu Su led his {{followers}} and some civilians southward to Juchao County to join Zhou Yu. He ordered able-bodied {{young men to}} guard the rear while the others moved ahead first. The local authorities sent some armed horsemen to stop Lu Su and his party from leaving.

You won't be rewarded for your efforts (even if you succeed in stopping us), but neither will you be punished if you don't pursue us. Do you really want to <b>force</b> <b>us</b> (<b>to</b> fight)?" [...] He then placed a shield upright on the ground and fired an arrow at it, piercing through the shield. The horsemen agreed with what Lu Su said and knew they could not stop him, so they gave up and left. Lu Su then crossed the Yangtze River with Zhou Yu and arrived in Jiangdong, where they met Sun Ce, who felt that Lu Su was a special person. Lu Su settled in Qu'e County (曲阿縣; in present-day Danyang, Jiangsu). When his grandmother died, he returned to Dongcheng County to attend her funeral.|$|E
2500|$|The first Irish clubs {{discussed}} admitting {{women as}} members in 1912, but the proposal floundered over issues of social class. Gender equity in Rotary moved beyond the theoretical question when in 1976, the Rotary Club of Duarte in Duarte, California, admitted three women as members. After the club refused {{to remove the}} women from membership, Rotary International revoked the club's charter in 1978. The Duarte club filed suit in the California courts, claiming that Rotary Clubs are business establishments subject to regulation under California's Unruh Civil Rights Act, which bans discrimination based on race, gender, religion or ethnic origin. Rotary International then appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. The RI attorney argued that [...] "... threatens to <b>force</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> take in everyone, like a motel". The Duarte Club {{was not alone in}} opposing RI leadership; the Seattle-International District club unanimously voted to admit women in 1986. The United States Supreme Court, on 4 May 1987, confirmed the Californian decision. Rotary International then removed the gender requirements from its requirements for club charters, and most clubs in most countries have opted to include women as members of Rotary Clubs. The first female club president to be elected was Silvia Whitlock of the Rotary Club of Duarte, California in 1987. By 2007, there was a female trustee of Rotary's charitable wing The Rotary Foundation while female district governors and club presidents were common.|$|E
2500|$|In July, Feige {{discussed}} specific {{moments in}} the film, including an homage to The Amazing Spider-Man issue 33 where Parker is trapped underneath rubble, something Feige [...] "wanted {{to see in a}} movie for a long, long time". Daley said that they added the scene to the script because of how much Feige wanted it, and explained, [...] "We have [...] starting the scene with such self-doubt and helplessness, in a way that you really see the kid. You feel for him. He's screaming for help, because he doesn't think he can do it, and then ... he kind of realizes that that's been his biggest problem." [...] Feige compared the film's final scene, where Parker accidentally reveals that he is Spider-Man to his Aunt May, to the ending of Iron Man when Stark reveals that he is Iron Man to the world, saying, [...] "what does that mean for the next movie? I don't know, but it will <b>force</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> do something unique." [...] Goldstein added that it [...] "diminishes what is often the most trivial part of superhero worlds, which is finding your secret. It takes the emphasis off that [...] lets her become part of what's really his life". Feige also talked about the film's revelation that the Vulture is the father of Parker's love interest, saying, [...] "If that didn't work, the movie didn't work. We worked backwards and forwards from that moment. It was like two movies—it was the movie up until then and the movie after that moment. Because it had to surprise you, but it had to be true, also. You had to believe that we had set it up so that you would buy it [...] doesn't seem like something out of left field.

Watts said the revelation scene and the following interactions between the Vulture and Parker were, [...] "more than anything else, [...] I was looking forward to, and I got {{to have a lot of}} fun shooting that stuff." [...] Goldstein said the scene after the reveal, where Vulture realizes that Parker is Spider-Man while driving him to the school dance, was the moment he was most proud of in the film, and Daley said that scene's effect on audiences was the dramatic equivalent of an audience laughing at a joke they had written. He added that the writers were [...] "giddy when we first came up with , because it's taking the obvious tension of meeting the father of the girl that you have a crush on, and multiplying it by 1,000, when you also realize he's the guy you've been trying to stop the whole time." ...|$|E
