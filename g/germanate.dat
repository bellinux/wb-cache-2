5|$|Germanium is a shiny grey-white solid. It has a {{density of}} 5.323 g/cm3 and is hard and brittle. It is mostly unreactive at room {{temperature}} but is slowly attacked by hot concentrated sulfuric or nitric acid. Germanium also reacts with molten caustic soda to yield sodium <b>germanate</b> Na2GeO3 and hydrogen gas. It melts at 938°C. Germanium is a semiconductor with an electrical conductivity of around 2 × 10−2S•cm−1 and a band gap of 0.67eV. Liquid germanium is a metallic conductor, with an electrical conductivity {{similar to that of}} liquid mercury.|$|E
5|$|The PHEBUS {{experiment}} {{was designed by}} CESR (Toulouse) to record high energy transient events in the range 100keV to 100MeV. It consisted of two independent detectors and their associated electronics. Each detector consisted of a bismuth <b>germanate</b> (BGO) crystal 78mm in diameter by 120mm thick, surrounded by a plastic anti-coincidence jacket. The two detectors were arranged on the spacecraft so as to observe 4π steradians. The burst mode was triggered when the count rate in the 0.1 to 1.5MeV energy range exceeded the background level by 8 sigma in either 0.25 or 1.0 seconds. There were 116 energy channels.|$|E
25|$|Scintillation {{detectors}} use crystals that emit {{light when}} gamma rays {{interact with the}} atoms in the crystals. The intensity of the light produced is usually proportional to the energy deposited in the crystal by the gamma ray; a well known situation where this relationship fails is the absorption of <200keV radiation by intrinsic and doped sodium iodide detectors. The mechanism {{is similar to that}} of a thermoluminescent dosimeter. The detectors are joined to photomultipliers; a photocathode converts the light into electrons; and then by using dynodes to generate electron cascades through delta ray production, the signal is amplified. Common scintillators include thallium-doped sodium iodide (NaI(Tl))—often simplified to sodium iodide (NaI) detectors—and bismuth <b>germanate</b> (BGO). Because photomultipliers are also sensitive to ambient light, scintillators are encased in light-tight coverings.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{focussing}} on the crystallographic challenges and what knowledge we can gain from studying the different open-framework <b>germanates.</b> Five new open-framework <b>germanates</b> have been synthesized and the structures have been determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. A thorough description {{is made of}} the different problems raised with the different compounds, whether it is choice of crystal system in SU- 61, twinning and possible ordering in SU- 46, superstructure and variation in elemental content in SU- 57, template disorder in JLG- 5 or framework disorder in SU- 44. Open-framework <b>germanates</b> are often built from one type of cluster, such as the Ge 7 [Ge 7 X 19], Ge 8 [Ge 8 X 20], Ge 9 [Ge 9 Xn, n = 25 - 26] and Ge 10 [Ge 10 X 28], (X =O, OH, F) clusters.

40|$|Novel open-framework <b>germanates</b> and vanadoborates, {{which are}} {{constructed}} from typical types of clusters, have been synthesized based on different strategies. The crystal structures are solved by using single crystal X-ray diffraction (SXRD) technique or by combined techniques. Additionally, {{the structures of}} two open-framework materials, PKU- 3 and PKU- 16, are determined from nano-sized crystals by rotation electron diffraction (RED) combined with powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). This thesis serves as an introduction to synthesis of open-framework <b>germanates</b> and vanadoborates based on different design strategies. Two <b>germanates</b> are obtained; SU- 74 is achieved by employing a novel structure directing agent (SDA), SUT- 8 is achieved by assembling the novel structure building units (SBUs) of Co@Ge 14 {{with the introduction of}} cobalt ions in the synthesis. Four strategies are successfully used in construction of open-framework vanadoborates: using metal-oxo polyhedra as the linkages in SUT- 6; applying the scale chemistry approach in SUT- 7; employing metal-organic complexes as the linkages in SUT- 12, SUT- 13, SUT- 14; and introducing covalent bond organic linkages into SUT- 10 and SUT- 11. Single crystal X-ray diffraction is used to conduct the structure determination in combination with other techniques. Furthermore, the structures of two open-framework materials, an aluminoborate PKU- 3 and a germanosilicate PKU- 16, are solved from nano-sized crystals using RED data. The structures are further confirmed by Rietveld refinement against PXRD data. The advantages of the RED techniques are demonstrated in two aspects. In PKU- 3, the presence of seriously preferred orientation and light elements in the structure makes it difficult for structure determination by PXRD, but it is easier by RED. In PKU- 16, the RED technique is used to determine its structure from the as-synthesized multi-phasic sample containing nano-sized crystals. After the structure of PKU- 16 has been solved, the synthesis of this interesting phase can be optimized and pure PKU- 16 can be obtained.

40|$|The {{luminescence}} {{emission of}} (Zn, Be) ~GeO 4 :Mn phosphors {{at room temperature}} and near liquid nitrogen temperature is qualitatively {{similar to that of}} the (Zn, Be) 2 SiO 4 :Mn phosphors. In both the <b>germanates</b> and silicates, a green emission band is observed with low manganese and beryl-lium concentrations. Increase in the concentration of either of these two constituents causes the growth of a new band in the red region of the spectrum. Certain differences in properties are noted, however, between the ger-manates and the silicates. The most important of these is the absence of any clear-cut "red " band in the low temperature mission of Zn 2 GeO 4 containing large manganese concentrations. Corresponding Zn 2 SiO 4 phos-phors clearly show the red band. The results of the emission measurements are discussed in the light of two hypotheses that have been proposed to explain the dependence of the luminescence of manganese on the nature and composition of the host crystal. It is concluded that the results are more in harmony with the "coordination " hypothesis (wherein color differences are related to differ-ences in coordination umber of the manganese) than with the "aggregate" hypothesis (wherein color differences are attributed to different configura-tions of Mn + 2 in the crystal, i. e., singlets, pairs, triplets, etc.).

40|$|Recently, apatite-type <b>germanates</b> La 9. 33 +xGe 6 O 26 + 3 x/ 2 have {{attracted}} considerable interest {{due to their}} high oxide ion conductivities. Research {{has shown that the}} key defects are oxide ion interstitials which lead to the conversion of some of the GeO 4 units to GeO 5. Consequently there has been a large interest in the preparation of high oxygen excess samples with high defect concentration. This strategy, however, leads to a reduction in symmetry from hexagonal to triclinic for x 0. 4, and consequently to reduced oxide ion conductivity at low temperatures. We present doping strategies to stabilise the hexagonal lattice, while maintaining high oxygen content. In particular, partial substitution of La by smaller rare earths (Y, Yb) is shown to be successful in preparing x= 0. 67 samples with hexagonal symmetry and hence high conductivities. In addition, doping on the Ge site with Ti, Nb or W, {{has been shown to be}} similarly successful, leading to very high oxygen contents for W doping, e. g. La 10 Ge 5. 5 W 0. 5 O 27. 5. In the case of Ti doping, however, there was some evidence for trapping of the interstitial oxide ions around the Ti.
