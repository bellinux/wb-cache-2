25|$|I do {{not quite}} {{understand}} what it is that compels me to type this letter. Perhaps it is to leave some vague reason for the actions I have recently performed. I do not really understand myself these days. I am supposed to be an average reasonable and intelligent young man. However, lately (I cannot recall when it started) <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> victim of many unusual and irrational thoughts. These thoughts constantly recur, and it requires a tremendous mental effort to concentrate on useful and progressive tasks.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> Catholic and an infidel; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> Roman {{priest and}} a hypocrite; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> profligate under a cowl. I am that Father Achilli, who {{as early as}} 1826, was {{deprived}} of my faculty to lecture, for an offence which my superiors {{did their best to}} conceal; and who in 1827 had already earned the reputation of a scandalous friar. I am that Achilli, who in the diocese of Viterbo in February, 1831, robbed of her honour a young women of eighteen; who in September 1833, was found guilty of a second such crime, {{in the case of a}} person of twenty-eight; and who perpetrated a third in July, 1834, in the case of another aged twenty-four. I am he, who afterwards was found guilty of sins, similar or worse, in other towns of the neighbourhood. I am that son of St. Dominic who is known to have repeated the offence at Capua, in 1834 or 1835; and at Naples again, in 1840, in the case of a child of fiteen. I am he who chose the sacristy of the church for one of these crimes, and Good Friday for another. Look on me, ye mothers of England, a confessor against Popery, for ye 'ne'er may look upon my like again.' I am that veritable priest, who, after all this, began to speak against, not only the Catholic faith, but the moral law, and perverted others by my teaching. I am the Cavaliere Achilli, who then went to Corfu, made the wife of a tailor faithless to her husband, and lived publicly and travelled about with the wife of a chorus-singer. I am that Professor of the Protestant College at Malta, who with two others was dismissed from my post for offences which the authorities cannot get themselves to describe. And now attend to me, such as I am, and you shall see what you shall see about the barbarity and profligacy of the Inquisitors of Rome.|$|E

25|$|I {{have long}} been gravitating towards the Socialist {{position}} — {{of course there is}} Socialism and Socialism, and mine is of the reasonable and moderate kind. When I look over my public efforts through the years, {{it seems to me that}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> Socialist all my life. So far as any Party can express what appears to me to be the country's needs, the ILP approximates nearer to my outlook that any other, although I still look forward to and hope for the day when all really progressive forces can unite under the title of the Democratic Party. But Liberalism as represented by both wings — the Lloyd George wing, and the Asquith wing, is right outside my outlook now.|$|E
25|$|Since {{my life as}} a {{prisoner}} has begun, I have heard the teachings of the white man's religion, and in many respects believe it to be better than the religion of my fathers...

I believe that the church has helped me much during the short time <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> member. I am not ashamed to be a Christian, and I am glad to know that the President of the United States is a Christian, for without the help of the Almighty I do not think he could rightly judge in ruling so many people. I have advised all of my people who are not Christians, to study that religion, because {{it seems to me the}} best religion in enabling one to live right.|$|E

[...] In 1954, after his last Carnegie Hall [...] appearance, Grainger's long promotion of Grieg's music was recognised when he was awarded the [...] St. Olav Medal by King Haakon of Norway. However, a growing bitterness [...] was becoming evident in his writings and correspondence; in a letter to the Danish composer Herman Sandby, a lifelong friend, he bemoaned the continuing ascendency in music of the [...] "German form", and asserted that [...] "all my compositional life <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> leader without followers".|$|E
500|$|To protect Wollstonecraft, Imlay {{registered}} her as {{his wife}} in 1793, {{even though they were}} not married. After declaring war on Britain, France was blockaded by the Royal Navy, which caused shortages that worsened the problem of inflation. Imlay engaged in blockade-running, chartering ships to be bring in food and soap from America into France, which explained why both he and Wollstonecraft were not arrested during the Reign of Terror. As the Terror began in France with arrests and executions occurring daily, Wollstonecraft came under suspicion as someone from a nation that was at war with France and who was known to be a friend of leading Girondins, which led Imlay to make a false statement to the U.S. embassy in Paris that he had married her, automatically making her into an American citizen, in order to protect her from arrest. Some of her friends were not so lucky; many, like Thomas Paine, were arrested, and some were even guillotined (Wollstonecraft's sisters believed she had been imprisoned). Wollstonecraft called life under the Jacobins [...] "nightmarish" [...] with gigantic parades in the day where everyone had to cheer, lest they fall under suspicion of not being committed to the republic, and police raids at night to arrest [...] "enemies of the republic". In a letter to her sister Everina, written in March 1794, Wollstonecraft wrote: [...] "It is impossible for you to have any idea of the impression the sad scenes <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> witness to have left on my mind...death and misery, in every shape of terror, haunted this devoted country – I certainly am glad that I came to France, because I never could have had else a just opinion of the most extraordinary event that has ever been recorded." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{arrival of}} Chrissie Watts was {{announced}} barely {{a month before}} she was set to first appear on-screen, and {{came at a time}} when EastEnders was undergoing immense media criticism and falling ratings. The rush of casting meant Oberman had little time to process the enormity of the part she had taken on, declaring: [...] "my feet haven't even touched the ground yet. [...] I haven't had time to think about what this role is going to do to my life! I'm very excited to be part of such a fantastic show and one <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> fan of for many years." [...] She admitted, however, to being [...] "slightly intimidated" [...] by the high media profile and press interest surrounding the show at the time. Indeed, joining EastEnders [...] "proved to be something of a baptism of fire for Oberman", as she was playing opposite Leslie Grantham whose recent return to the show had been a highly publicised event. Twenty-four hours after Chrissie's first episode went to air a scandal surrounding Grantham hit the tabloid papers. According to Oberman, the atmosphere on set the next day [...] "was a bit tense" [...] but, she added, [...] "the Watts are pulling together and we're getting on with it and working". However Oberman was also reportedly finding things difficult, having walked into a highly complicated situation: [...] "Tracy-Ann is still really finding her feet on the show... she feels really left out because all the cast are blackballing Grantham and refusing to talk to him. Since most of her scenes are with Grantham, it's really hard for her." [...] Looking back on the incident after she had left EastEnders, Oberman remarked, [...] "I respect Leslie for fronting it out; he emerged from his dressing room and started working. No one mentioned the story. That's life in EastEnders; the machine never stops." ...|$|E
