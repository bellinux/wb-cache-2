40|$|Traffic {{systems are}} so {{important}} that they shape the form of cities. And yet {{the growing number of}} vehicles in high-density cities creates a situation that places pedestrians in direct competition with vehicles for space, especially in city centers. Current methods, such as underground and elevated walkways, are just passive measures. They do not <b>integrate</b> <b>pedestrian,</b> vehicular and building systems and therefore are not conducive to a city’s street life. At best, these <b>systems</b> still leave <b>pedestrian</b> traffic intermittent and discontinuous, instead of streamlining the flow of people and goods. Buildings play vital roles in urban space, such as offering public space within buildings, supporting the function needed by the public, improving the environment of public space, and working as nodes to reconcile the contradiction between vehicles and pedestrians. In order to implement these roles, a symbiotic relationship between <b>pedestrian</b> <b>systems</b> and buildings is required. Currently in China, functions are highly concentrated in city centers and cities are developing towards a high-density, which leads to the development of three-level traffic systems especially in city centers. In the process of weaving together new building and traffic infrastructure, China has a great opportunity to establish <b>pedestrian</b> <b>systems</b> that are <b>integrated</b> with buildings. The main work of the paper is listed below: (1) With the analysis of the successful <b>pedestrian</b> <b>systems</b> of Hong Kong, Bangkok and Boston, I summarized a variety of connection methods between buildings and <b>pedestrian</b> <b>systems,</b> as well as several ways that multi-function buildings support <b>pedestrian</b> <b>systems.</b> After that, the Assessment Methodology was proposed in terms of the three precedents together with related theories. (2) By implementing the Assessment Methodology on three city centers in Shanghai (Wujiaochang, Yangpu District, Lujiazui, Pudong District and Xujiahui, Xuhui District), I summarized the merits and demerits of each urban center. (3) I proposed the design strategy for the symbiotic relationship between <b>pedestrian</b> <b>systems</b> and buildings on the basis of previous analysis of Hong Kong, Bangkok and Boston, together with the three city centers in Shanghai. (4) Basing on the 5 design strategies, I proposed a design for one site within Wujiaochang. I <b>integrated</b> buildings and <b>pedestrian</b> <b>systems</b> to create a convenient, II desirable and dynamic place for pedestrians, as well as solve the existing challenges of <b>pedestrian</b> <b>systems</b> in the entire area. The symbiotic relationship between <b>pedestrian</b> <b>systems</b> and buildings is to clarify the role of buildings in <b>pedestrian</b> <b>systems,</b> allowing buildings to serve as essential nodes, and <b>integrate</b> with the <b>pedestrian</b> <b>systems.</b> Thus, it would contribute to the continuity of pedestrian behavior and offer functional support, enhance the efficient and comfort level for pedestrian, stimulate more socializing and activities in public space, and therefore will improve the street culture. Especially in high-density cities, buildings can be utilized to interconnect the <b>pedestrian</b> <b>systems</b> on elevated, ground, and underground levels, contributing to safe, convenient and desirable walking environment. Hence the symbiotic relationship between <b>pedestrian</b> <b>systems</b> and buildings will help to address the problems found in existing <b>pedestrian</b> <b>systems</b> within high-density cities...|$|R
40|$|Dominant {{modes of}} {{transport}} in city centres {{have a significant}} influence on urban morphology, land usage, {{the character of the}} urban environment and people’s life style. Cities are currently faced with potentially severe environmental impacts from global warming and other detrimental side effects resulting from a high dependence on motor vehicles. Many metropolises are now beginning to realize the importance of planning and developing walking as a primary travel mode in the city. Improving accessibility, continuity, safety, availability and connectivity for pedestrians has crucial significance as a means of decreasing vehicle usage and increasing public transport usage. In some places, underground pedestrian networks have been used to <b>integrate</b> <b>pedestrian</b> traffic in transport systems, at the same time, as a strategy to provide additional space resources for multiple functions (such as commercial and public activities) for urban redevelopment. Underground <b>pedestrian</b> <b>systems</b> can contribute to building walkable cities, accelerating the harmonious development of pedestrian spaces on the street level and underground to provide convenience for pedestrians. The research focuses on the interrelationship between underground <b>pedestrian</b> <b>systems</b> and urban environment. The research conducts a secondary data collection from 51 cases of underground <b>pedestrian</b> <b>systems</b> worldwide to generalize influences of environmental factor on developing underground <b>pedestrian</b> <b>systems</b> in city centres. Influencing factor, namely climate condition is considered for response to the hypothesis regarding its influence on deciding underground <b>pedestrian</b> <b>systems</b> utilization. The analysis is the basis for further research considering more influencing factors such as city scale and economic level.

Improving accessibility, continuity, safety, availability and connectivity for pedestrians has critical importance as a means of decreasing vehicle usage and increasing public transport usage. Within the city centres of the mega cities, underground <b>pedestrian</b> <b>systems</b> (UPS) have been used to <b>integrate</b> <b>pedestrian</b> traffic in transport systems as a redevelopment strategy to provide additional space resources for multiple functions, such as commercial and public activities. With the recent economic success in China, the research relating to the impact on urban environments remains lacking, and this challenges the successful development of UPS in the future. Three UPS in Shanghai were subjected to a detailed investigation to understand the impact of the UPS, especially {{from the perspective of the}} users' perception. Data were obtained from on-the-spot observations, face to face questionnaires with the UPS users, and interviews with an academic, a coordinator of a UPS project and two UPS managers. The research integrated both qualitative and quantitative methods, which analyzed the issues relating to accessibility and ease of orientation with the UPS. The research revealed that as an important component of central urban area <b>pedestrian</b> <b>systems,</b> the UPS have limited functionality to its users and are not fully utilized by the general public.

40|$|<b>Pedestrian</b> <b>systems</b> {{as a part}} of {{mobility}} systems is a key issue for the development of cities. Traditional planning and public policies based on modernist approaches have directed most efforts to improve motorised transport systems, reducing the participation of the non-motorised ones, including pedestrians, in the modal split. However, with the saturation of those approaches, there has been a clear trend worldwide regarding awareness about the importance of walking to raise liveability and efficiency in the urban areas. The shortage of parking in relation to the increasing amount of vehicles, fuel costs, congestion, limitation for infrastructure expansion and environment appeal have shifted attention to <b>pedestrian</b> <b>systems.</b> This paper presents a discussion on <b>pedestrian</b> <b>systems</b> design and its representation on the modal split in the City of Bogot?, considering for the analysis the "gaps? in modelling these systems. The methodologies used were descriptive and a case study.

For those who are unfamiliar with the campus environment, an effective <b>pedestrian</b> navigation <b>system</b> is essential to orientate and guide them around the campus. Compared to traditional navigation systems, such as physical signposts and digital map kiosks, a mobile <b>pedestrian</b> navigation <b>system</b> provides advantages in terms of mobility, sensing capabilities, weather-awareness when the user is on the go. However, how best to design a mobile <b>pedestrian</b> navigation <b>system</b> for university campuses is still vague due to limited research in understanding how pedestrians interact with the system, and what information is required for traveling in a complex environment such as university campus.

To achieve pedestrian detection from near to far ranges, a novel structure was proposed. The structure of our PDS consists of two cameras (called CS and CL separately). The CS is equipped with a short focal length lens to detect pedestrians in near-to-mid range; and, the CL is equipped with a long focal length lens to detect pedestrians in mid-to-far range. To accelerate the processing speed of pedestrian detection, the parallel computing capacity of GPU was utilized in the PDS. The synchronization algorithm is also introduced to synchronize the detection results of CS and CL.

This paper provides an overview of the development of GSPS across the world, and discusses the varied issues and debates relating to the development rationale and impacts of GSPS. The literature review indicates that GSPS were implemented in various cities due to various considerations and they have varied impacts on the city and its people both positively and negatively. As a relatively new topic in urban and transport studies, GSPS highlights important issues and questions that are deserving of more in-depth research. This research suggests that five research aspects need to be updated: new drivers beyond what has been presented in previous research; evidence-based research of GSPS in different cities; quantitative assessment of the development of GSPS; comparisons of the development patterns of such systems in the world; and the development of GSPS in developing countries.

In this paper we describe a new pedestrian wayfinding model that addresses this problem. A graph model is created which consists of decision points and edges connecting them. The free (walkable) space around decision points is expanded to decision scenes where pedestrian movement is modeled in more detail, thus allowing for flexible navigation comparable to unassisted pedestrians. We connect this model with the cognitive needs of users of <b>pedestrian</b> navigation <b>systems</b> and show how our approach incorporates these. ...|$|R
