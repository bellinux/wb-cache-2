Beam monitors are proposed {{to be placed in}} vacuum to detect the channeled beam and to measure the fluence of the <b>channeled</b> particles. To <b>intercept</b> the <b>channeled</b> hadrons a silica radiator is placed in the beam pipe vacuum. Cherenkov light is produced and guided out of the pipe using radiation hard silica fibers. Light is finally detected with a Micro-Channel Plate photomultiplier. Simulation of the detector performances are presented and technical solutions for light transmission and detection in presence of the LHC high radiation environment and of the LHC stringent safety requirements are discussed...|$|R

Here we describe and experimentally demonstrate a very simple but highly effective attack which even {{does not need to}} <b>intercept</b> the quantum <b>channel</b> at all. Only by exploiting the dead time effect of single photon detectors the eavesdropper is able to gain (asymptotically) full information about the generated keys without being detected by state-of-the-art QKD protocols. In our experiment, the eavesdropper inferred up to 98. 8 % of the key correctly, without increasing the bit error rate between Alice and Bob significantly. Yet, we find an evenly simple and effective countermeasure to inhibit this and similar attacks...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problems of}} evaluating a water harvesting catchment system in the arid environment of the Negev Desert, Israel. A general interpretation of arid hillslope hydrological response is developed called Contiguous Area Contribution. Whilst agreeing with humid area concepts of partial area contribution, it focusses on the different nature of arid slope contributions to stormflow where frequent and rapid overland flow generation <b>intercepts</b> <b>channels</b> by downslope expansion and extension of flow-lines. The physical system at Avdat is geometrically represented as a flow net of hillslope and channel cascades for kinematic routing. A survey of the micro-morphology and surface materials enables hillslope areas to be classified into six broad units {{on the basis of}} their textural characteristics. These units are used to quasi-distribute process data sampled at locations within them. The process of infiltration is discussed and different mathematical models examined using results from a limited number of field measurements with runon/runoff apparatus. The best-fit is provided by the storage model of Green and Ampt and not the Hortonian models of Philip and Kostiakov. Initial infiltration rates vary from 85 to 18 mm hr- 1 and steady- state rates from 60 to 6 mm hr- 1. The inclusion of detention storage in early time period observations is shown to be a significant problem in modelling. For flow routing, an alternative approach to assuming sheetflow is presented using cross-slope microtopographic profiles to provide an estimate of surface geometry for flow across micro-rough surfaces. Measurements of flow velocity for different discharges are made using the runon/runoff apparatus. By assuming sheetflow, a lower value of Manning's n is predicted if velocity and flow dimensions are known. For a given n, the assumption of sheetflow predicts a lower velocity for a given discharge. The values of n derived at Avdat range from 0. 18 to 1. 36 with a mean of 0. 64 when a micro-rough surface is retained, and 0. 12 to 0. 62 with a mean of 0. 36 if sheetflow is assumed, values considerably higher than those usually adopted from channel studies. A distributed model is developed to handle surface runoff processes at a range of scales from the small plot to the complete catchment. In a detailed sensitivity analysis, the range of physical and process parameters derived for Avdat show sensitivity of the runoff processes to particular parameters and their combination. For the selected range, flow boundary shape is the most significant influence on the shape of flow hydrographs resulting in quicker, higher peaks if a micro-rough flow geometry is assumed. The model is used at the plot scale to examine the problem of including detention storage in infiltration model parameters, at the cascade scale to show the effect of runoff production enhancing and inhibiting slope areas, and at the sub-catchment scale to assess the predictive ability of the model using the limited process parameter data-set. With three sub-catchments, prediction errors were good volumetrically ranging from 6 % to 14 % for the high intensity, short duration rainstorm, but deteriorated for the long duration, varied intensity storm with predicting high overestimates. Three sub-catchments consistently under-predicted and one over-predicted. In most, the rising and falling limbs were lagged relative to the observed hydrographs...|$|R

Many algorithms have been proposed to separate successfully monodimensional signals from their observed mixed signals. Recently, ICA has been applied to face recognition problem. In this manuscript, a new idea for image encryption and decryption schemes, based on ICA, is proposed. Using some mixing procedure as an encryption method, one can hide useful information transmitted over wireless channels. The main idea of our approach is to secure the transmitted information at two levels: classical level using standard keys and second level (spatial diversity) using independent transmitters. In the second level, a hacker should <b>intercept</b> not one <b>channel</b> but all of them in order to retrieve the information.

40|$|We {{consider}} the generic problem of Secure Aggregation of Distributed Information (SADI), where several agents {{acting as a}} team have information distributed among them, modeled {{by means of a}} publicly known deck of cards distributed among the agents, so that each of them knows only her cards.

40|$|We {{develop and}} study {{adaptive}} rate scheduling mechanisms over cellular wireless networks, as {{used for the}} unicast provision of video streams to client mobiles at variable quality of experience (QoE) levels. Under service type I, mobile users receive video streams at a QoE level that is not lower than a specified value. In addition, mobile users that experience sufficiently high communications channel quality levels, may be provided video streams at higher video quality levels. Under service type II, mobile clients receive their video streams at QoE levels {{that are based on}} their recorded signal to noise and interference (SINR) levels. Resource allocations among mobiles are however subjected to absolute and proportional fairness objectives. We employ a proxy video manager and resource controller that is located at (or associated with) the base station node. The manager <b>intercepts</b> a <b>channel</b> quality indicator (CQI) message reported by a mobile client, using it to determine the QoE level at which a requested video stream will be provided. It then selects the proper source and channel encoding schemes to be used for producing and transmitting a compressed version of the stream. To regulate inter-cell signal interference, we examine the joint employment of a number of different spectral-reuse and fractional frequency reuse (FFR) scheduling schemes. To illustrate the use of our models to configure system parameters, we consider a performance metric that incorporates a will-topay utility function. We develop analytical techniques for the modeling, analysis and design of such systems. We confirm the precision of these models through the conduct of simulation analyses. Also, we show that, under certain system configurations, FFR-based schemes can lead to substantial enhancement of the system’s performance behavior...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{the last}} two decades, {{wireless}} communications have been introduced in various applications. However, the transmitted data can be, at any moment, intercepted by non-authorized person. That could be explain why data encryption and secure transmission have gained enormous popularity.

40|$|Radio {{frequency}} identification (RFID) systems come {{in different}} flavours; passive, active, semi-passive, or semi-active. Those {{different types of}} RFID are supported by different, internationally accepted protocol standards {{as well as by}} several accepted proprietary protocols. Even though the diversity is large between the flavours and between the standards, the RFID technology has evolved to be a mature technology, which is ready to be used in a large variety of applications. This thesis explores active RFID technology and how to develop and apply data communication protocols that are energy efficient and which comply with the different application constraints. The use of RFID technology is growing rapidly, and today mostly “passive” RFID systems are used because no onboard energy source is needed on the transponder (tag). However, the use of “active” RFID-tags with onboard power sources adds a range of opportunities not possible with passive tags. Besides that Active RFID offers increased working distance between the interrogator (RFID-reader) and tags, the onboard power source also enables the tags to do sensor measurements, calculations and storage even when no RFID-reader is {{in the vicinity of the}} tags. To obtain energy efficiency in an Active RFID system the communication protocol to be used should be carefully designed. This thesis describes how energy consumption can be calculated, to be used in protocol definition, and how evaluation of protocols in this respect can be made. The performance of such a new protocol, in terms of energy efficiency, aggregated throughput, delay, and number of collisions in the radio channel is evaluated and compared to an existing, commercially available protocol for Active RFID, as well as to the IEEE standard 802. 15. 4 (used, e. g., in the Zigbee medium-access layer). Simulations show that, by acknowledging the payload and using deep sleep mode on the tag, the lifetime of a tag is increased. For all types of protocols using a radio channel, when arbitrating information, it is obvious that the utilization of that channel is maximized when no collisions occur. To avoid and minimize collisions in the media it is possible to <b>intercept</b> <b>channel</b> interference by using carrier sense technology. The knowledge that the channel is occupied should result in a back-off and a later retry, instead of persistently listening to the channel which would require constant energy consumption. We study the effect on tag energy cost and packet delay incurred by some typical back-off algorithms (constant, linear, and exponential) used in a contention based CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access/ Collision Avoidance) protocol for Active RFID communication. The study shows that, by selecting the proper back-off algorithm coefficients (based on the number of tags and the application constraints), i. e., the initial contention window size and back-off interval coefficient, the tag energy consumption and read-out delays can be significantly lowered. The initial communication between reader and tag, on a control channel, establishes those important protocol parameters in the tag so that it tries to deliver its information according to the current application scenario in an energy efficient way. The decision making involved in calculating the protocol parameters is conducted in the local RFID-reader for highest efficiency. This can be done by using local statistics or based on knowledge provided by the logistic backbone databases. As the CMOS circuit technology evolves, new possibilities arise for mass production of low price and long life active tags. The use of wake-up radio technology makes it possible for active tags to react on an RFID-reader at any time, in contrast to tags with cyclic wake-up behaviour. The two main drawbacks with an additional wake-up circuit in a tag are the added die area and the added energy consumption. Within this project the solution is a complete wake-up radio transceiver consisting of only one hi-frequency very low power, and small area oscillator. To support this tag topology we propose and investigate a novel reader-tag communication protocol, the frequency binary tree protocol...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Rawalpindi city, having {{population}} of 1. 6 million, generates approximately 70 MG of wastewater daily. Presently only 35 % {{of the total}} wastewater is being collected by RWASA and the remaining 65 % of the wastewater is being diposed off into open drains that ultimately drains off into Nalluh Lai. Due to the geological sub soil conditions of the sub-surface strata, wastewater (0. 545 million m 3 /day) flowing in Nullah Lai (main recharge source) easily gets into fissured bed rocks and transport associated contaminants through flow nets into deep aquifer, causing ground water contamination. Over extraction of ground water is exposing upper aquifer, which allows contaminant transport associated with wastewater flowing in open drains and Nullahs and ultimately causing ground water contamination. Recent analysis of 220 tube wells has revealed that 50 % of the tube wells are producing bacteriological contaminated water against 33 % in the year 2003. Hence after detailed situational analysis, the only viable solution to protect the ground water source of Rawalpindi is termination of subsoil seepage and infiltration of contaminated water from Lai Nullah and other streams by proper lining of secondary streams and constructing a box <b>channel</b> <b>intercepting</b> the dry weather flow (mainly sewage water) which will act as a dry weather sewer for safe disposal of sewage generated from Rawalpindi and Islamabad.

5000|$|With {{the change}} to {{offensive}} tactics the Spitfire, Hurricane and new Westland Whirlwind units found themselves facing the same disadvantages over France as the 109 units had faced over Britain. The limited combat radius of the RAF fighters meant that the Luftwaffe could engage in combat, or break off on their own terms, knowing that they were over friendly territory and with plenty of airfields at which they could land to rearm and refuel. The RAF fighters {{were the ones who}} were now having to face the prospect of two long over-water passages, returning in many cases with combat damage. By late 1940, Luftwaffe fighter units were being re-equipped with the formidable new Bf 109F-1 and F-2, considered by many Luftwaffe pilots to be the best of the many variants of this fighter. The F-1s and F-2s easily outperformed the Spitfire Mk Is and IIs and it closely matched that of the Mk Vs which were just about to enter service. In the hands of pilots like Adolf Galland it was a daunting proposition to be facing this aircraft over France. On 10 July 1941, a 109 F-2 flown by Hauptmann Rolf Pingel of I./JG 26. followed a Short Stirling heavy bomber he had <b>intercepted</b> across the <b>Channel.</b> Return fire from the Stirling hit his fighter's cooling system, forcing him to [...] "crash-land" [...] in a field near Dover.

The latter utilizes rotation to pump liquid samples and reagents, and to actuate mixing between different liquids during transport in the channel using secondary flow generated from rotation. Experiments {{have been carried out}} on a rotating platform wherein two liquids are directed from their respective reservoirs through small capillaries into a common channel when the centrifugal force generated from rotation exceeds the capillary force which initially traps the liquid in their respective reservoirs. As two liquids are combined to flow through a common channel directed radially outward, Coriolis acceleration which is proportional to the rotation speed and relative radial velocity of the fluids, induces a tangential acceleration and thus velocity component that directs opposite to the direction of rotation. As this cross-flow, predominantly with maximum effect {{at the center of the}} <b>channel,</b> <b>intercepts</b> the far wall (i. e. pressure face) it splits up into two streams returning the flow back to the leading (in direction of rotation) face of the channel. This produces two main vortices/circulations for the channel and smaller vortices at the four corners for a channel with a rectangular cross-section. These vortices specifically the two main vortices are responsible for mixing of momentum, mass and energy in the cross-flow direction as the throughflow moves radially outward along the channel from small to a large radius. In the reference frame of the rotating channel, the combination of throughflow and crossflow results in two cork screw-shaped helical flow pattern streaming down the rotating channel. Connected with a microscope to view in details of the mixing in a small area, a rotating camera, mounted to the rotating platform, is used to take video of the mixing at various locations along a radial channel 30 -mm in length and 1 mm width. This test is repeated for other observation locations along the channel. All the tests under identical rotation speed are grouped together to provide a full record of the mixing in the entire channel. These results can also be examined as mixing under same rotation speed but different channel lengths. Obviously, increasing length enhances mixing especially at small channel lengths under 5 - 10 mm. However, between 10 - 30 mm downstream mixing is diminished. It was also found that higher rotation speed can indeed produces better mixing with a modest increase.
