[...] Determined not to commit this valuable final reserve so far away from France, Napoleon rejected another such request, this time from Marshal Ney. Instead, he called the commander of the [...] "Young Guard", Marshal Mortier and instructed him to guard the field of battle without moving forward or backward, {{while at the same time}} unleashing a massive cannonade with his 400 guns.|$|E

That I should be caught in this death trap? Jack Thayer compared it to the sound of [...] "locusts on a summer night", while George Rheims, who jumped moments before Titanic sank, described it as [...] "a dismal moaning sound which I won't ever forget; it came from those poor people who were floating around, calling for help. It was horrifying, mysterious, supernatural." ...|$|E

Michael Howard and Charles Kennedy, {{the leaders of}} the UK's other leading political parties at the time, were also present. A guard of honour was provided by 56 officers wearing the uniforms of each of the UK's police forces. The Queen stated that [...] "It is surely appropriate that this should be positioned in The Mall - an area of London so often associated with our national way of life. When people pass by the memorial, I hope they will pause and reflect on the proud traditions that it represents.

500|$|But here I {{would not}} be misunderstood. By the love of our country, I do not mean loyalty to our King, for that is a duty of another nature, and a man may be very loyal, in the common sense of the word, without one grain of public good in his heart. Witness this very kingdom we live in. I verily believe, that since the {{beginning}} of the world, no nation upon earth ever shewed (all circumstances considered), such high constant marks of loyalty in all their action and behaviour as we have done; and at the same time, no people ever appeared more utterly void of what is called public spirit ... therefore, I shall think my time not ill-spent if I can persuade most and all of you who hear me, to shew the love you have for your country by endeavouring in your several situations to do all the public good you can. For <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>certain</b> persuaded that all our misfortunes arise from no other original cause than that general disregard among us to the public welfare.|$|E

500|$|Washington, {{who was in}} 1789 {{elected the}} first president, resented Mason's strong stances against the {{ratification}} of the constitution, and these differences destroyed their friendship. Although some sources accept that Mason dined at Mount Vernon on November 2, 1788, Peter R. Henriques noted that Washington's diary states that Mr. George Mason was the guest, and as Washington, elsewhere in his diary, always referred to his former colleague at Philadelphia as Colonel Mason, the visitor was likely George Mason V, the son. Mason always wrote positively of Washington, and the president said nothing publicly, but in a letter referred to Mason as a [...] " [...] friend" [...] who would not recant {{his position on the}} constitution because [...] "pride on the one hand, and want of manly candour on the other, will not <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>certain</b> let him acknowledge error in his opinions respecting it [...] though conviction should flash on his mind as strongly as a ray of light". Rutland suggested that the two men were alike in their intolerance of opponents and suspicion of their motives.|$|E
500|$|To {{what extent}} Mint Assistant Engraver (later Chief Engraver) George T. Morgan should be {{credited}} {{for work on}} the half dollar and quarter eagle is uncertain; Mint officials and employees were not consistent on this point. [...] Assistant Director Mary M. O'Reilly said in 1936 that the bureau's records indicated that Barber was the designer. [...] Later the same year, she forwarded a statement by an unnamed Philadelphia Mint employee stating that by {{the very nature of}} Barber's and Morgan's long association (Morgan was Barber's assistant for 37 years), the two engravers would have conferred frequently, and that Morgan's technique is [...] "very obvious on both sides of both coins". The employee concluded that [...] "no mistake could be made, in my opinion, in crediting both men with the execution of these two coins. [...] <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>certain</b> that this is correct." [...] Q. David Bowers, in his book on commemoratives, mentions the dispute, credits Barber on the obverses of both coins, and gives both men credit on the reverse of the half dollar. He asserts Morgan created the reverse of the quarter eagle.|$|E
500|$|After the {{disaster}} at Sidi Barrani and the withdrawal from Egypt, Lieutenant General Annibale Bergonzoli's XXIII Corps faced the British {{from within the}} strong defences of Bardia.

[...] Bergonzoli replied: [...] "I am aware of the honour and I have today repeated to my troops your message — simple and unequivocal. In Bardia we are and here we stay." [...] Bergonzoli had approximately 45,000 defenders under his command. The Italian divisions defending the perimeter of Bardia included remnants of four divisions. The northern ("Gerfah") sector was held by the 2nd [...] "28 October" [...] Blackshirt Division; the centre ("Ponticelli") sector by the 1st [...] "23 March" [...] Blackshirt Division and elements of the 62nd [...] "Marmarica" [...] Infantry Division; and the southern ("Mereiga") sector by the 63rd [...] "Cirene" [...] Infantry Division {{and the rest of}} the 62nd [...] "Marmarica" [...] Infantry Division. [...] Bergonzoli also had the remnants of the disbanded 64th [...] "Catanzaro" [...] Infantry Division, some 6,000 Frontier Guard (GaF) troops, three companies of Bersaglieri, part of the dismounted Vittorio Emanuele cavalry regiment, and a machine gun company of the 60th [...] "Sabratha" [...] Infantry Division.|$|E

500|$|The British premiere at the 1988 Edinburgh Festival brought {{critical}} praise: [...] "Through its sheer cleverness, wit, lyrical {{beauty and}} sense of theater, it sweeps aside most of the criticism to which it lays itself open." [...] When the work was finally performed in London, 13 years after its Houston premiere and after {{a long period of}} theatrical neglect, Tempos critic Robert Stein responded to ENO's 2000 production enthusiastically. He particularly praised the performance of Maddalena, and concluded that [...] "Adams's triumph... consists really in taking a plot chock-full of talk and public gesture, and through musical characterisation... making a satisfying and engaging piece." [...] Of the ENO revival in 2006, Erica Jeal of The Guardian wrote that [...] "from its early visual coup {{with the arrival of the}} plane, Sellars' production is an all-too-welcome reminder of his best form". In Jeal's view, the cast met admirably the challenge of presenting the work in a non-satirical spirit. Reviewing the 2008 Portland Opera production (the basis of the 2011 Canadian Opera Company presentation in Toronto), critic Patrick J. Smith concluded that [...] "Nixon in China is a great American Opera. I suspected that it was a significant work when I saw it in 1987; I was ever more convinced of its stature when I heard it subsequently, on stage and on disc, and today <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>certain</b> that it is one of the small handful of operas that will survive." ...|$|E
500|$|... "In Congress, {{there was}} little doubt that homosexuals did not belong in {{sensitive}} government positions." [...] Since the late 1940s, the government had been dismissing about five homosexuals a month from civilian posts; by 1954, the number had grown twelve-fold. [...] "Mixed in with the hysterics were some logic, though: homosexuals faced condemnation and discrimination, and most of them—wishing to conceal their orientation—were vulnerable to blackmail." [...] DCI Roscoe Hillenkoetter was called to Congress to testify on homosexuals being employed at the CIA. He said, [...] "The use of homosexuals as a control mechanism over individuals recruited for espionage is a generally accepted technique which has been used at least on a limited basis for many years." [...] As soon as the DCI said these words, his aide signaled to take {{the remainder of the}} DCI's testimony off the record. Political historian David Barrett uncovered Hillenkoetter's notes, which reveal the remainder of the statement: [...] "While this agency will never employ homosexuals on its rolls, it might conceivably be necessary, and in the past has actually been valuable, to use known homosexuals as agents in the field. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>certain</b> that if Josef Stalin or a member of the Politburo or a high satellite official were known to be a homosexual, no member of this committee or of the Congress would balk against our use of any technique to penetrate their operations... after all, intelligence and espionage is, at best, an extremely dirty business." [...] The Senators reluctantly agreed the CIA had to be flexible.|$|E
500|$|Newly elected President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych {{wanted to}} oust the current Cabinet and form a new Cabinet with his Party of Regions after his {{election}} on February 7, 2010. On February 20, 2010 Parliament Speaker Volodymyr Lytvyn stated he would announce {{the dissolution of the}} coalition the next plenary week if its activity by then was not confirmed in documents. On February 17 Lytvyn had asked the coalition to provide within ten days documents that confirmed its existence, in particular, a list of at least 226 Members of Parliament who are members. Lytvyn stated {{that it was possible to}} ensure [...] "the effectiveness of the current coalition" [...] or create a new coalition in parliament. Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko stated on February 22 she was holding negotiation [...] "to unite in the Verkhovna Rada the democratic and pro-Ukrainian forces, all rational deputies of Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc, the Lytvyn Bloc and Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc". If the current Cabinet could not be preserved Tymoshenko has stated she would go into Parliamentary opposition. During a Cabinet of Ministers meeting on February 24, 2010 Tymoshenko stated “I am certain that Our Ukraine group leaders … will stand firmly in the defense of Ukraine and everything Ukrainian. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>certain</b> that these leaders will not change their ideology or beliefs and join a majority coalition led by Party of Regions” (the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc or Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc faction where needed to form a new coalition). On February 24 Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine’s parliament) Volodymyr Lytvyn received a document that had been drafted by the Party of Regions faction that had been submitted for examination by all factions, except the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc, according to the Party of Regions the document was not the draft of a new coalition agreement but [...] "a document submitted to the head of the Lytvyn Bloc faction in the process of talks so that he can consider this draft and we proposed that our colleagues consider this coalition agreement and make their amendments and remarks, if they deem it necessary".|$|E
