Meanwhile, Girish assists Gurcharan's family and takes them to London for the heart treatment. Misunderstandings follow and upon the family’s return from London, Shekhar assumes that Girish and Lalita are married and agrees to marry Gayatri.

While examining the Pandorica, Amy confronts the Doctor about an engagement ring she had previously found {{in the pocket of}} his jacket and feels a strong emotional attachment to; he says that it belonged to a [...] "friend", and that nothing is ever truly forgotten. The Pandorica is transmitting a signal amplified by Stonehenge's rocks across the universe, and River warns the Doctor that the signal is drawing [...] "everything that ever hated [...] " [...] to Earth that night. The Doctor is aided by a volunteer group of Roman legionaries; the centurion in charge of them is revealed to be Amy's fiancé, Rory.

500|$|In the present, Ana Lucia starts {{questioning}} Henry Gale in the hatch, {{but suddenly}} he attacks her, {{and is only}} stopped when John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) knocks him unconscious. Locke asks Henry why he attacked Ana Lucia, but has never tried to hurt him. Henry says that Locke is [...] "one of the good ones". Although Libby (Cynthia Watros) advises Ana Lucia {{not to try to}} get revenge on Henry, she is determined and asks James [...] "Sawyer" [...] Ford (Josh Holloway) for a gun, but is rejected. Ana Lucia returns and after Sawyer still refuses to give her a gun, she has sex with him, and is able to distract him long enough to steal the gun. Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) return with Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau). Michael wakes up and tells everyone in the hatch that he tracked the Others down and found out that they are living worse off than the survivors. He also says that once he is healthy, he will organize a rescue mission to reclaim his son Walt Lloyd (Malcolm David Kelley). After Locke and Jack begin to plan a rescue mission for Walt, they realize that they need more guns, and go to Sawyer, who realizes that Ana Lucia has stolen his. Elsewhere, Hugo [...] "Hurley" [...] Reyes (Jorge Garcia) has planned a romantic picnic for himself and Libby, but Hurley gets lost and leads them back to the survivors' beach. There, he realizes that he forgot to pack a blanket and Libby offers {{to go back to the}} hatch to retrieve one. She also suggests that Hurley ask Rose and Bernard for some wine for the picnic, a suggestion that Hurley is delighted to hear. Meanwhile, back in the hatch, Michael asks Ana Lucia what is going on and she explains a few things: Sawyer has all the guns, Jack, Locke, and Kate left to get the guns, and they currently have one of the Others, Henry, in captivity inside the armory. She mentions that Henry tried to kill her earlier in the day and that although she was about to kill Henry, she was not able to pull the trigger. Michael offers to do it, but after she <b>hands</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> gun he turns around and shoots her dead. Libby walks in with the blankets and startles Michael causing him to shoot her too.

2500|$|At the Great Entrance, {{when the}} sacred vessels are brought in {{procession}} to the Holy Table (altar), the priest will place the Aër over the deacon's left shoulder [...] before he <b>hands</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> Diskos (the priest himself {{will carry the}} Chalice). For this reason, the Aër will often have ribbons sewn onto it, {{so it can be}} tied securely in place. If there is no deacon serving, the priest will place the Aër around his own shoulders like a cape, which will leave his hands free to take both the Diskos and the Chalice.|$|E

2500|$|Two men in armor lead in Tamino. They recite one of {{the formal}} creeds of Isis and Osiris, {{promising}} enlightenment to those who successfully overcome the fear of death (""). This recitation takes the musical form of a Baroque chorale prelude, {{to the tune of}} Martin Luther's hymn [...] "Ach Gott, vom Himmel sieh darein" [...] (Oh God, look down from heaven). Tamino declares that he is ready to be tested. Pamina calls to him from offstage. The men in armour assure him that the trial by silence is over and he is free to speak with her. Pamina enters and declares her intention to undergo the remaining trials with him. She <b>hands</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> magic flute to help them through the trials ("").

2500|$|Dwight holds a {{high level}} of respect for Michael, viewing him as a model for success, and often {{participating}} with Michael's ill-conceived schemes. However, he betrays Michael numerous times, such as when he goes over Michael's head to vie for the manager's job in [...] "The Coup". Despite this, Michael frequently dismisses Dwight and often appears embarrassed by his antics; for much of the series, he also refuses to promote Dwight from [...] "Assistant to the Regional Manager" [...] to [...] "Assistant Regional Manager". In later seasons, Dwight was shown to return the favor, such as Dwight telling Michael that he would have a better career if he'd taken a job at Home Depot. Several times throughout the series, however, it is revealed that Michael does care about Dwight's feelings, and the two sometimes share bonding moments. In [...] "Training Day", Dwight is unhappy when the open branch manager position goes to Deangelo Vickers, and when he learns that Michael did not recommend him for the job, as he led him to believe, he snubs Michael and goes to a meeting Vickers has called, leaving Michael standing outside, by himself. In [...] "Goodbye, Michael", Dwight is still frustrated with Michael, but his hostility turns into heartfelt appreciation as Michael <b>hands</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> recommendation letter. At first, the letter does not seem to impress him, but, as he reads through, he realizes that Michael really does respect him. They are later seen engaging in a friendly paintball fight, and Dwight's loyalty to Michael is once again restored. Also, after Michael left, Dwight did not have the same respect for Deangelo and Andy that Dwight previously had for Michael, implying that Dwight truly respects and values Michael. In a deleted scene from [...] "Finale", Dwight stated that Michael sent him his [...] "World's Best Boss" [...] mug when he became Regional Manager.|$|E
2500|$|Back at Mr. Gold's shop he swaps Hook's {{hand for}} the actual hook, but says that their deal is not done. Hook {{says that it is}} done because he saw Mr. Gold use the real dagger to open the box, which means he is still lying to Belle. Mr. Gold {{produces}} a video tape with a recording from the house they just left, threatening to reveal it to Emma. Hook states he only did it to rid himself of the cursed hand to be a better man, and that Emma will understand that. Mr. Gold then reveals that the hand is not cursed, but it allowed Hook to be [...] "the man he really is." [...] Mr. Gold states the hand allows him to be his true pirate self and embrace his darkness. Hook threatens that he'll have no problem [...] "crushing Belle's heart" [...] with the truth of Gold's deception and Mr. Gold states if that happens, he will [...] "lose" [...] Emma. For his threats, Gold states that Hook now serves him {{for as long as he}} lives, anticipating the [...] "fun" [...] they will have together. Emma visits the jail to talk to Will Scarlet and shows him the book he was found next to. He tries to say it has no meaning to him. Emma looks at his eye and asks what happened. Will sees Hook arrive and claims that he does not remember what happened to his eye. When Emma asks him about his hook being back, Hook states that Mr. Gold's magic wasn't what he had hoped it would be. David, going through documents with Elsa, tells Emma that the Snow Queen's alias, Sarah Fisher, is nowhere in any Storybrooke records stating that she did not arrive at the town via the curse. Hook, Emma, David and Elsa all look at each other wondering how the Snow Queen arrived at Storybrooke and Emma asks what she wants with her. Henry tells Regina that they need to talk to his other grandpa, Mr. Gold, about finding out who wrote the book to find the author. Regina says that Mr. Gold will not want to help her, so he goes to the shop and tells Mr. Gold that he wants to work at the shop. Henry states that because his father is dead Mr. Gold is the closest link to him, [...] Mr. Gold agrees to let Henry be his apprentice, but tells him not to touch anything. Then, Mr. Gold <b>hands</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> broom he and Hook used to find the Apprentice. After Mr. Gold leaves, Henry begins to sweep the floor.|$|E
