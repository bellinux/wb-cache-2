40|$|This {{study focused}} on the {{identification}} of <b>career</b> <b>paths</b> {{that led to the}} Texas public school superintendency, including an examination of <b>career</b> <b>path</b> differences associated with gender, ethnicity, and district type, and on the identification of the <b>career</b> <b>path</b> positions superintendents perceived as being the most beneficial in preparing them for the superintendency. Additionally, the study examined place-bound versus career-bound superintendents. The most common <b>career</b> <b>path</b> to the Texas public school superintendency was secondary teacher, secondary principal, and superintendent. Female administrators and administrators who worked in large districts were more likely to take the director route to the superintendency. Additionally, most major urban superintendents took the director route to the superintendency. Ethnicity was not a significant factor in determining the <b>career</b> <b>path</b> to the superintendency. A significant correlation did exist between educational attainment and the secondary teacher, secondary assistant principal, secondary principal, assistant superintendent, superintendent <b>career</b> <b>path.</b> A higher representation of superintendent respondents who held earned doctorates existed in that <b>career</b> <b>path</b> than in any of the other <b>career</b> <b>path</b> groups.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to test a career development model examining the path of relationships amongst autonomy/prestige, <b>career</b> <b>path,</b> training and learning, job satisfaction, career commitment, and performance for moderately defined career professionals. Based on a systematic categorization of careers, from well defined to less well defined, project managers were determined to have moderately defined careers. The researcher employed a survey resulting in 644 project manager respondents. Path analysis was effectuated as a modeling technique to determine whether there was a pattern of intercorrelations among variables. A career development model framing the relationship between project managers?????? perceptions of their <b>career</b> <b>paths</b> on their respective performance was explored. The direct path relationships included: (a) frequency of participation in training and learning activities was negatively related to performance, (b) <b>career</b> <b>path</b> was positively related to performance, (c) autonomy/prestige was positively related to performance, and (d) career commitment was negatively related to performance. The indirect path relationships included (a) autonomy/prestige was mediated by career commitment and performance; (b) the connection between <b>career</b> <b>path</b> and performance was mediated by frequency of participation in training and learning (c) <b>career</b> <b>path</b> to performance, was mediated by job satisfaction and career commitment, and (d) <b>career</b> <b>path</b> to performance was mediated by job satisfaction, career commitment, and autonomy/prestige.

It is becoming evident that small social enterprise are seeking ways to provide managerial career options that are suited to individual and organisational need (Spear and Bidet, 2005;Maher, 2014). A survey and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 40 operational managers working in eight social enterprises. Eight HR managers working in the same eight organisations were interviewed to provide insight into managerial <b>career</b> <b>path</b> management systems in small social enterprises. The findings suggest that operational manager’s <b>career</b> <b>path</b> preferences are influenced by the individual’s values and career needs and the organisation’s ability to provide <b>career</b> <b>path</b> options for managers.

Analysis revealed {{the most significant}} predictors for the <b>career</b> <b>paths</b> to be entry port, number of higher education positions held, and the first prior position held.

Analysis {{of the influence of}} gender on the <b>career</b> <b>paths</b> and mobility concludes there is {{no significant difference in the}} <b>career</b> <b>path,</b> entry port, first prior position held, number of positions held, or number of years in faculty and administrative positions. However, these women did serve in their first, second, and fourth positions for significantly less time than their male peers. It was concluded that: (1) gender strongly influenced the number of years held in each position but did not influence the mobility and <b>career</b> <b>paths</b> of women CAOs; and (2) women CAOs are younger and moving faster through their <b>career</b> <b>paths</b> than their male peers.

Career choice and development theory, particularly that of Super, provided the framework for the development of the <b>Career</b> <b>Path</b> Model which includes three measurement points: at graduation from the preparation program, at one year following graduation, and at five years following graduation;The model was tested using survey data collected from two samples of ISU teacher education graduates. The first sample, Spring, 1980 and 1980 / 1981 academic year graduates (N = 246), provided data at all three measurement points for examining One Year <b>Career</b> <b>Path</b> and Five Year <b>Career</b> <b>Path.</b> The second sample, 1982 / 1983 academic year graduates (N = 179), provided data at the first two measurement points for cross-validating the portion of the model that predicted One Year Career Path;The model was generally supported. The results of the discriminant analysis procedure indicated that variables from all four major <b>Career</b> <b>Path</b> Model areas (personal and background characteristics, preparation program factors, employment factors, and indicators of career satisfaction) contributed significantly to the prediction of One Year <b>Career</b> <b>Path</b> in the testing with both samples.
