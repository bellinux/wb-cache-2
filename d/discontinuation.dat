40|$|Objective: To {{establish}} whether efavirenz dose {{reduction in}} patients with high plasma concentrations prevents toxicity-induced efavirenz <b>discontinuations.</b> Methods: HIV-infected patients with a high efavirenz plasma concentration (>= 4. 0 mg/L) while using efavirenz 600 mg once daily {{as part of their}} highly active antiretroviral therapy regimen were selected from the AIDS Therapy Evaluation in The Netherlands cohort study. These patients were classified into 2 groups. The reduced-dose group contained all patients who underwent dose reduction after the high plasma concentration measurement; the standard-dose group consisted of patients who had no dose reduction. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards analysis were used {{to assess the impact of}} dose reduction on toxicity-induced efavirenz <b>discontinuations.</b> Results: One hundred eighty patients with high plasma efavirenz levels were included, 47 of them subsequently had their efavirenz dose reduced from 600 mg to 400 mg once-daily, which resulted in a 41 % decrease in the median efavirenz plasma concentration. At week 48, the Kaplan-Meier estimated cumulative incidence of toxicity-induced efavirenz <b>discontinuations</b> was 11. 5 % in patients who continued the standard dose versus 2. 3 % in patients who had a dose reduction; P = 0. 066 (log-rank test). Dose reduction was not associated with loss of virological suppression. Conclusions: Dose reduction may prevent toxicity-induced <b>discontinuations</b> {{in patients with}} high efavirenz plasma concentrations, whereas not compromising virological efficac...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} was to improve understanding of adverse events occurring with celecoxib {{in the treatment of}} osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Data were extracted from company clinical trial reports of randomised trials of celecoxib in osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis lasting 2 weeks or more. Outcomes were <b>discontinuations</b> (all cause, lack of efficacy, adverse event, gastrointestinal adverse event), endoscopically detected ulcers, gastrointestinal or cardio-renal events, and major changes in haematological parameters. The main comparisons were celecoxib (all doses) versus placebo, paracetamol (acetaminophen) 4, 000 mg daily, rofecoxib 25 mg daily, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (naproxen, diclofenac, ibuprofen, and loxoprofen). For NSAIDs, celecoxib was compared both at all doses and at licensed doses (200 to 400 mg daily). Thirty-one trials included 39, 605 randomised patients. Most patients had osteoarthritis and were women of average age 60 years or above. Most trials lasted 12 weeks or more. Doses of celecoxib were 50 to 800 mg/day. Compared with placebo, celecoxib had fewer <b>discontinuations</b> for any cause or for lack of efficacy, fewer serious adverse events, and less nausea. It had more patients with dyspepsia, diarrhoea, oedema, more adverse events that were gastrointestinal or treatment related, and more patients experiencing an adverse event. There were no differences for hypertension, gastrointestinal tolerability, or <b>discontinuations</b> for adverse events. Compared with paracetamol, celecoxib had fewer <b>discontinuations</b> for any cause, for lack of efficacy, or diarrhoea, but no other differences. Compared with rofecoxib, celecoxib had fewer patients with abdominal pain and oedema, but no other differences. Compared with NSAIDs, celecoxib had fewer symptomatic ulcers and bleeds, endoscopically detected ulcers, and <b>discontinuations</b> for adverse events or gastrointestinal adverse events. Fewer patients had any, or a gastrointestinal, or a treatment-related adverse event, or vomiting, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, or reduced haemoglobin or haematocrit. <b>Discontinuations</b> for lack of efficacy were higher. No differences were found for all-cause <b>discontinuations,</b> serious adverse events, hypertension, diarrhoea, nausea, oedema, myocardial infarction, cardiac failure, or raised creatinine. Company clinical trial reports present much more information than published papers. Adverse event information is clearly presented in company clinical trial reports, which are an ideal source of information for systematic review and meta-analysis. Citation: Moore, R. A. et al.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{relative}} clinical success of hypertransmissible rigid and soft contact lenses in terms of the rates of adverse events and clinical <b>discontinuations.</b> METHODS: One hundred subjects (50 experienced wearers and 50 neophytes) were fitted with either the Z-alpha lens (Menicon) or the Focus Night & Day lens (CIBA Vision), which were worn on a 30 -day continuous wear basis. The rates of adverse events and clinical <b>discontinuations</b> were monitored over 12 months. RESULTS: There were 20 adverse events that were categorized as being serious or significant [...] four with rigid lenses and 16 with soft lenses (p = 0. 003). There was no significant difference between the experienced (10) and the neophyte (10) groups (p = 1. 00). There were 23 clinical <b>discontinuations</b> [...] 13 with rigid lenses and 10 with soft lenses (p = 0. 46). Fewer experienced wearers (five) discontinued than neophytes (18) (p = 0. 002). CONCLUSIONS: Practitioners should anticipate fewer adverse events with rigid versus soft lenses prescribed for continuous wear. Experienced wearers are less likely to discontinue compared with neophytes...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE. To report {{differences}} {{in the incidence of}} adverse events and <b>discontinuations</b> found in a group of neophyte contact wearers using two different silicone hydrogel contact lenses on a daily- and continuous-wear basis during an 18 -month period. METHODS. Sixty-one subjects were initially examined, and 53 were eligible to participate in the study. Eligible subjects were randomly assigned to wear one of two silicone hydrogel materials: lotrafilcon A or balafilcon A lenses on a daily- or continuous-wear basis. After an initial screening, subjects were monitored weekly for the first month and then after 3, 6, 12, and 18 months. The incidence of adverse events, including corneal infiltrative events, superior epithelial arcuate lesions, and contact lens-induced papillary conjunctivitis, and <b>discontinuations</b> {{in each of the four}} contact lens groups were recorded. RESULTS. Twenty-two adverse events were found. A higher incidence of adverse events was found in subjects wearing lotrafilcon A lenses than in those wearing balafilcon A lenses (χ = 4. 40, P= 0. 04). There were fewer adverse events in subjects wearing lenses on a daily-wear basis than in those wearing lenses on a continuous-wear basis (χ = 5. 98, P= 0. 01). Eight subjects discontinued from the study as a result of recurrent corneal infiltrative events (one), vision problems (two), excessive ocular discomfort (one), relocation (one), noncompliance with the study protocol (one), and being lost to follow-up (two). No significant differences were found in the number of <b>discontinuations</b> between the two lens types (χ = 0. 66, P= 0. 42) and wearing regimens (χ = 0. 08, P= 0. 78). CONCLUSIONS. Lotrafilcon A lenses were associated with a higher incidence of adverse events than balafilcon A lenses were, and this difference is attributed to the difference in the incidence of corneal infiltrative events. Subjects wearing lenses on a daily-wear basis had fewer adverse events than did subjects wearing lenses on a continuous-wear basis. Both lens types and wearing regimens showed a similar incidence of <b>discontinuations.</b> © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc...|$|R
5|$|<b>Discontinuation</b> of benzodiazepines or abrupt {{reduction}} of the dose, even after a relatively short course of treatment (three to four weeks), may result in two groups of symptoms—rebound and withdrawal.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To compare {{treatment}} persistence {{between two}} dosages of interferon β- 1 a {{in a large}} observational multiple sclerosis registry and assess disease outcomes of first line MS treatment at these dosages using propensity scoring to adjust for baseline imbalance in disease characteristics. METHODS: Treatment <b>discontinuations</b> were evaluated in all patients within the MSBase registry who commenced interferon β- 1 a SC thrice weekly (n =  4678). Furthermore, we assessed 2 -year clinical outcomes in 1220 patients treated with interferon β- 1 a in either dosage (22 µg or 44 µg) as their first disease modifying agent, matched on propensity score calculated from pre-treatment demographic and clinical variables. A subgroup analysis was performed on 456 matched patients who also had baseline MRI variables recorded. RESULTS: Overall, 4054 treatment <b>discontinuations</b> were recorded in 3059 patients.
