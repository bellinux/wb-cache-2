Two types of <b>joint</b> <b>insurance</b> products, namely joint first-to-die and joint last-to-die, are considered in this project.

The total riskiness of the portfolio is decomposed into its insurance risk and its investment risk. For illustrative purposes, an AR(1) process is used to model the stochastic interest rates.

40|$|In this paper, {{we review}} and discuss some {{challenges}} in insuring flood risk in Europe {{on the national}} level, including high correlation of damages. Making use of recent advances in extreme value theory, we, furthermore, model flood risk with heavy-tailed distributions and their truncated counterparts and apply the discussed techniques to an inflation- and building-value-adjusted annual data set of flood losses in Europe. The analysis leads to Value-at-Risk estimates for individual countries and for Europe as a whole, allowing to quantify the diversification potential for flood risk in Europe. Finally, we identify optimal risk pooling possibilities in case a <b>joint</b> <b>insurance</b> strategy on the European level cannot be realized and quantify the resulting inefficiency in terms of additional necessary solvency capital. Thus, the results {{also contribute to the}} ongoing discussion on how public risk transfer mechanisms can supplement missing private insurance coverage...|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} theory of {{incomplete}} markets where households that consist of two ex ante identical, and ex post heterogeneous agents can provide mutual insurance though adjustments in labor supply. We do so by taking stock from the vast literature of search models {{of the labor market}} and trace the differences between bachelor and couples household economies. Our main goal is to address whether joint search within the household unit can help reconcile the suggestive business cycle properties of aggregate employment, unemployment and labor force participation. We use data from the CPS on labor market transitions of married couples and we show that <b>joint</b> <b>insurance</b> is important factor in explaining why the labor force is nearly acyclical. When we turn to the model however we find that these predictions are not entirely consistent with our theory. We then go on to explore what important additions need to be made to our benchmark framework to bring the model closer to the data...|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the effect of parents' Medicaid status {{on the use of}} preventive health services by young children. Using data from the 1996 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), we analyzed a logit model for receipt of any well-child visits (WCVs) that compared three groups of low-income children. The three groups, defined by the <b>joint</b> <b>insurance</b> status of children and their parents, involved Medicaid pairs (both the child and the parent had Medicaid throughout the year), mixed pairs (the child had Medicaid and the parent was uninsured), and uninsured pairs (both child and parent were uninsured). Medicaid coverage for children was positively associated with receipt of any WCVs. However, the utilization effect of Medicaid coverage for children was significantly larger when the parent was also on Medicaid instead of being uninsured. Considering uninsured children with uninsured parents in 1996, enrolling only the children in Medicaid would have increased the percentage with WCVs from 29 to 43 percent according to simulations with the logit model. If the parents were enrolled in Medicaid as well, the percentage of children with any WCVs would have increased to 67 percent...|$|E
