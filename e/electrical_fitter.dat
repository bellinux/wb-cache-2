5|$|During the winter, {{they played}} {{baseball}} for the Fitzroy Baseball Club, often competing in matches played as curtain raisers {{to the elite}} Australian rules football competition, the Victorian Football League. In 1948, Harvey was selected at short stop in the 1948 All-Australian baseball team. Saturday night entertainment for the family typically consisted of dinner after the day’s cricket matches for Fitzroy and Plant, Liddicut and other club personnel were often invited. Under the influence of cricketing mentors Plant and Liddicut, the boys were taught to adopt an aggressive approach, using fast feet movement to attack spin bowling in particular. Harvey made his First XI debut for Fitzroy in 1941–42. In 1943–44, he scored a club record of 817 First XI runs in a season. In 1942–43, Neil was promoted to Fitzroy's First XI, joining Merv, Mick and Ray. During that season, the family held down the first four batting positions for Fitzroy; Merv and Mick opened the batting and Ray and Neil came in after them. Ray continued to play for Fitzroy {{over the next two}} decades when he was not required by Victoria. Outside cricket, Harvey was an <b>electrical</b> <b>fitter</b> and he worked for the Metropolitan Tramways Board. He and his wife Lorna and settled in the inner-northern suburb of Reservoir.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{dielectric}} and AC conductivity of rockwool fiberspolystyrene composites {{were studied}} {{as a function}} of frequency, temperature, and rockwool concentration through impedance measurements.

The observed <b>electrical</b> results <b>fit</b> approximately the reported empirical equations concerning the AC conductivity and dielectric behavior of polymer composites. The dielectric behavior of the prepared composites is mainly attributed to the dielectric properties of the rockwool filler.

40|$|A new self-consistent dynamic electro-thermal {{model for}} power HBTs is {{presented}} coupling a circuit-oriented <b>electrical</b> model <b>fitted</b> on experimental data with a fifil frequency domain thermal model. The thermal model provides the exact frequency behaviour {{of the device}} thermal impedance through a quasi- 3 D approach, rather than a simple single- or multi-pole rational approximation. The self-consistent solution is achieved, in large-signal periodic conditions, through Harmonic Balance analysis. The dy- namic model enables to discuss the behaviour of thermal collapse in multi-finger devices not only in DC, but also in AC conditions. In particular, a new interpretation is proposed for the thermal collapse loci of such devices in terms of bifurcations, thus providing a simpler and more straightforward stability criterion with respect to those already presented in the literature...|$|R
