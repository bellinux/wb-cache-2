25|$|Natural {{gas heating}} systems may cause carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning if unvented or poorly vented. In 2011, natural gas furnaces, space heaters, water heaters and stoves were blamed for 11 carbon monoxide deaths in the US. Another 22 deaths were attributed to appliances running on liquified petroleum gas, and 17 deaths on gas of unspecified type. Improvements in natural <b>gas</b> <b>furnace</b> designs have greatly reduced CO poisoning concerns. Detectors are also available that warn of carbon monoxide and/or explosive gas (methane, propane, etc.).|$|E
25|$|The {{two main}} types of heat pumps are {{compression}} and absorption. Compression heat pumps operate on mechanical energy (typically driven by electricity), while {{absorption heat pump}}s may also run on heat as an energy source (from electricity or burnable fuels). An absorption heat pump may be fueled by natural gas or LP gas, for example. While the gas utilization efficiency in such a device, which is {{the ratio of the}} energy supplied to the energy consumed, may average only 1.5, that is better than a natural gas or LP <b>gas</b> <b>furnace,</b> which can only approach 1.|$|E

25|$|Also, as {{the heat}} pump takes heat {{out of the}} air, some {{moisture}} in the outdoor air may condense and possibly freeze on the outdoor heat exchanger. The system must periodically melt this ice; this defrosting translates into an additional energy (electricity) expenditure. When it is extremely cold outside, it is simpler to heat using an alternative heat source (such as an electric resistance heater, oil furnace, or <b>gas</b> <b>furnace)</b> rather than to run an air-source heat pump. Also, avoiding {{the use of the}} heat pump during extremely cold weather translates into less wear on the machine's compressor.|$|E
25|$|The G.I. Bill {{guaranteed}} {{low cost}} loans for veterans, with very low down payments, and low interest rates. With 16 million eligible veterans, {{the opportunity to}} buy a house was suddenly at hand. In 1947 alone, 540,000 veterans bought one; their average price was $7300. The construction industry kept prices low by standardization – for example standardizing sizes for kitchen cabinets, refrigerators and stoves, allowed for mass production of kitchen furnishings. Developers purchased empty land just outside the city, installed tract houses based on a handful of designs, and provided streets and utilities, or local public officials race to build schools. The most famous development was Levittown, in Long Island just east of New York City. It offered a new house for $1000 down, and $70 a month; it featured three bedrooms, fireplace, gas range and <b>gas</b> <b>furnace,</b> and a landscaped lot of 75 by 100 feet, all for a total price of $10,000.

25|$|Very little housing {{had been}} built during the Great Depression and World War, except for {{emergency}} quarters near war industries. Overcrowded and inadequate apartments was the common condition. Some suburbs had developed around large cities where there was rail transportation to the jobs downtown. However, the real growth in suburbia depended {{on the availability of}} automobiles, highways, and inexpensive housing. The population had grown, and the stock of family savings had accumulated the money for down payments, automobiles and appliances. The product was a great housing boom. Whereas, an average of 316,000 new housing non-farm units should have been constructed 1930s through 1945, there were 1,450,000 annually from 1946 through 1955. The G.I.

2500|$|Fuel {{switching}} on the demand side refers to changing {{the type of}} fuel used to satisfy a need for an energy service. [...] To meet deep decarbonization goals, like the 80% reduction by 2050 goal being discussed in California and the European Union, many primary energy changes are needed. Energy efficiency alone may {{not be sufficient to}} meet these goals, switching fuels used on the demand side will help lower carbon emissions. Progressively coal, oil and eventually natural gas for space and water heating in buildings will need to be reduced. For an equivalent amount of heat, burning natural gas produces about 45 per cent less carbon dioxide than burning coal. [...] There are various ways in which this could happen, and different strategies will likely make sense in different locations. While the system efficiency of a <b>gas</b> <b>furnace</b> may be higher than the combination of natural gas power plant and electric heat, the combination of the same natural gas power plant and an electric heat pump has lower emissions per unit of heat delivered in all but the coldest climates. This is possible because of the very efficient coefficient of performance of heat pumps.|$|E

Those who know about such things explain what an interesting contrast the two statues are; for in the case of the governor of a hundred years ago one had to start from plain, rough material and work patiently for years to get the effect, whereas now the material doesn't matter at all, and with any sort of scrap, treated in the <b>gas</b> <b>furnace</b> under tremendous pressure, one may make a figure of colossal size like the one in Central Square.|$|E

30|$|Why {{then are}} heat pumps {{in use in}} only 9.5 % of Ontario’s single {{detached}} dwellings (SDD) [43]?

40|$|The blast <b>furnace</b> <b>gas</b> {{contains}} {{plenty of}} dust, which deposits easily {{on the bottom}} of seat sealing surface of the tri-eccentric butterfly valve in the pipeline, causing stuck and damage to the valve plate, thereby affects the production of the blast furnace and brings great economic loss. To derive the influence mechanism of effects of the blast <b>furnace</b> <b>gas</b> flow speed within the pipeline on the dust deposition laws in the butterfly valve region, a 3 D model of the butterfly valve and its regional flow field is built with Pro/E software. Based on FLUENT module of ANSYS Workbench, along with standard k-ε turbulence model and DPM model, simulation analysis of moving trajectories of dust particles in butterfly valve region under 3 blast <b>furnace</b> <b>gas</b> flow speeds is conducted.
