A physiological control system that mimics {{the response of the}} healthy heart is needed to adjust pump flow according to patient demand. Thus, baseline data is required on how the healthy heart (i. e. heart rate (HR) and cardiac output (CO)) and circulatory system (i. e. systemic vascular resistance (SVR)) respond. This study investigated the <b>response</b> <b>times</b> of the healthy heart during active postural changes (supine-standing-supine) in 50 healthy subjects (27 male / 23 female).

A liposome solution, containing the same ratio of zwitterionic/anionic lipids that are present in an Escherichia coli cell membrane, {{was applied to the}} NW devices. Lipid bilayer formation on the Si NWs was detected in-situ by observing electrical resistance changes complemented by confocal fluorescence microscopy imaging. The formation of lipid bilayers resulted in a 1 % to 2 % decrease in device current, consistent with the negative gating effect of the lipids on the NW surface. The devices demonstrated a≈ 1 min <b>electrical</b> <b>response</b> <b>time</b> to lipid encapsulation. Removal of the lipid layer was achieved by exposing the devices to a detergent, which resulted in NW conductance returning to its original value with a≈ 2 min recovery time.

To achieve this goal, we have grown Si-Si_ 1 _-_xGe_x undulating layer superlattices with x= 0. 39 and 0. 45 by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on top of epitaxial implanted CoSi_ 2 layers and fabricated 'vertical' MSM detectors.

40|$|Electrical and {{mechanical}} activities were recorded from the rectosigmoid of normal subjects using an intraluminal recording tube with {{two sets of}} bipolar electrodes and strain gauges. Four distinct types of electrical activities were recorded. (1) Electrical control activity (ECA). This activity varied in amplitude and frequency over time and the control waves were not phase-locked. The means of dominant frequency components in the lower and higher frequency ranges were 3. 86 +/- 0. 18 SD and 10. 41 +/- 0. 46 SD c/min, respectively. The overall dominant frequency component was mostly in the lower frequency range of 2. 0 - 9. 0 c/min. (2) Discrete <b>electrical</b> <b>response</b> activity (DERA). This activity appeared as short duration bursts (less than 10 s) of response potentials whose repetition rate was in the total colonic electrical control activity frequency range of 2. 0 - 13. 0 c/min. The mean duration of this activity was 2. 24 +/- 1. 30 SD s. (3) Continuous <b>electrical</b> <b>response</b> activity (CERA). This activity appeared as long duration bursts (greater than 10 s) of response potentials which were not related to electrical control activity. Its mean duration was 14. 78 +/- 3. 68 SD s. This activity generally did not propagate. (4) Contractile electrical complex (CEC). This activity appeared as oscillations in the frequency range of 25 - 40 c/min and was also not related to electrical control activity. This activity propagated, sometimes proximally and sometimes distally. Its mean duration was 18. 87 +/- 9. 22 SD s. The latter three types of electrical activities were all associated with different types of contractions. These contractions, however, did not always occlude the lumen. Colonic electrical control activity controls the appearance of discrete <b>electrical</b> <b>response</b> activity in <b>time</b> and space.

40|$|This chapter {{highlights}} {{the aspects of}} transient operation and measurements of thermoelectric (TE) materials and systems. If the timescale {{of changes in the}} working or boundary conditions is much greater than the <b>response</b> <b>time</b> of the <b>TE</b> system, a quasi-stationary approach is suitable to describe the transient behavior of the system. A dynamically switched TE cooler can be used to suppress hotspots in electronic chips. Supercooling is reached because there is a temporal and spatial interplay between Peltier cooling (mainly at an interface) and Joule heating as a volume effect. The chapter discusses two different methods for the dynamical determination of the thermal conductivity, namely laser flash analysis and classical Ioffe method. It also demonstrates how the Green's function technique works in the classical theory of thermoelectricity. In addition, the chapter provides the solution to the general formulation of time-dependent heat equation using the reciprocity property and adjoint Green's function...|$|R

40|$|When a step {{increase}} {{was made in}} VD, an overshoot was observed which was approximately 40 % larger than in the first test. This difference in overshoot is comparable to that which was measured on ISFET's (see Table I). As stated earlier, current overshoot was reduced for all membrane devices when gold was introduced at the membrane/insulator interface. The <b>time</b> <b>response,</b> however, was not always reduced. Instead, it was membrane dependent (see Table I). This suggests that the effect on <b>time</b> <b>response</b> of the gold layer is not due to the change in lateral charge distribution but rather {{is dominated by the}} change in the vertical impedance at the interface. This change in impedance is repre-sented by a change in the value of R 2 and C 2 in the lumped parameter model. Whether the impedance in-creases or decreases will depend on the properties of the gold/membrane interface. Conclusion The results of this study show that the <b>time</b> <b>response</b> of an ISFET is determined by membrane and gate structure. There are several applications of ISFET's where <b>electrical</b> <b>time</b> <b>response</b> information is im-portant. Multisensor operation is one example. If sev-eral devices were to be operated in the same solution simultaneously, multiplexing of bias voltages may be necessary. The maximum rate of multiplexing would be determined by the number and types of membranes used. Another application is in ISFET telemetry systems where power consumption is a major concern. To con-serve power, switching of bias voltages to low values after sampling may be desired. The <b>time</b> <b>response</b> of the devices will then determine the maximum sam-piing rate possible...|$|R
