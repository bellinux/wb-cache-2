40|$|Private U. S. {{corporations}} donated approximately $ 6 {{billion to}} nonprofit organizations in 1994. Corporations may donate money both directly to charities and indirectly through a corporate-sponsored foundation. Tax and financial advantages, {{as well as}} differences in corporate image, arise due to policy differences {{in the treatment of}} certain <b>gifts.</b> <b>This</b> paper <b>presents</b> a new model of corporate giving, and examines the financial implications of both direct and corporate foundation donations. Important considerations are corporate and foundation tax rates, the occurrence of donations to non-U. S. (or other non-tax-deductible) charities, the sale of assets to fund corporate foundations, and the effects of contributions over time. Comparative statics from a two-period model provide theoretical motivations for making certain types of gifts in certain ways. The results show that tax deductibility, tax rates, amounts of gifts made overseas, and capital gains provisions for corporate and foundation use affect giving. In fact, use of a nonprofit foundation for making contributions often results in a "subsidization" of monies to be distributed for charitable purposes and, hence, more after-tax income for the corporation...|$|R

40|$|The {{exchange}} of gifts at the New Year {{was a very}} significant social, political and financial event at the court of Henry VIII, just {{as it would have}} been at the courts of his English predecessors and European contemporaries. The process of gift exchange, including who made, received and gave gifts, was recorded each year in the <b>gift</b> roll. <b>This</b> article <b>presents</b> a detailed analysis of the 1539 gift roll, now in the Folger Shakespeare Library, Washington, DC, {{in the context of the}} other extant rolls for 1528, 1532 and 1534. Areas for discussion include a consideration of the range and significance of the gifts given and received by Henry and the role of the goldsmiths who made the king's gifts, including the weight, style and shape of the pieces commissioned. The article is supported by a full transcript of the 1539 gift roll, which is accompanied by extensive references comparing <b>this</b> <b>gift</b> roll to the other surviving gift rolls...|$|R
50|$|The school's namesake {{tree was}} a large elm tree that by 1940 had a height of 104 feet (31.7 meters), despite {{sustaining}} damage {{as a result of}} rough weather. The trunk had a diameter of seven feet (2.13 meters), and the branches spread out for more than 150 feet (45.72 meters). The tree died in 1964, though by this time it had assumed a place as a local legend. Logan Elm High School has in its possession a section of a limb donated by the class of 1965. In 1976 Robert Ely donated to the school a tomahawk which he had made out the wood of the tree. <b>This</b> <b>gift</b> was <b>presented</b> in exchange from a donation of $672 to the Easter Seals.|$|R
40|$|While various {{models have}} been {{proposed}} for generating social/friendship network graphs, the dynamics of user interactions through online social network (OSN) based applications remain largely unexplored. We previously developed a growth model to capture static weekly snapshots of user activity graphs (UAGs) using data from popular Facebook <b>gifting</b> applications. <b>This</b> paper <b>presents</b> a new continuous graph evolution model aimed to capture microscopic userlevel behaviors that govern {{the growth of the}} UAG and collectively define the overall graph structure. We demonstrate the utility of our model by applying it to forecast the number of active users over time as the application transitions from initial growth to peak/mature and decline/fatique phase. Using empirical evaluations, we show that our model can accurately reproduce the evolution trend of active user population for gifting applications, or other OSN applications that employ similar growth mechanisms. We also demonstrate that the predictions from our model can guide the generation of synthetic graphs that accurately represent empirical UAG snapshots sampled at different evolution stages...|$|R
