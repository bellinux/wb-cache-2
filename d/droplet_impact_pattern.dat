40|$|Extreme {{soil water}} {{repellency}} can have substantial implications for soil hydrology, plant growth and erosion, including enhanced splash erosion caused by raindrop impact. Previous studies of water <b>droplet</b> <b>impact</b> behaviour on man-made super-hydrophobic surfaces, with which water-repellent soil shares similar characteristics, revealed three distinct modes of splash behaviour (rebound, pinning and fragmentation) distinguished by two transition velocities: rebound-to-pinning (vmin) and pinning-to-fragmentation (v*). By using high-speed videography of single water <b>droplet</b> <b>impacts</b> {{we show that}} splash behaviour {{is influenced by the}} hydrophobicity of immobile particles, with hydrophobic glass spheres exhibiting all three modes of splash behaviour in the hydrophobic state but hydrophilic spheres exhibiting solely pinning behaviour. We found that increasing the particle size of fixed glass spheres increases vmin. A study of <b>droplet</b> <b>impact</b> on hydrophobic sand shows that the increased roughness of the immobile particles makes <b>impacting</b> <b>droplets</b> more likely to fragment at slower impact velocities. The mobility of the particles influenced <b>droplet</b> <b>impact</b> behaviour, with loose, hydrophobic particles displaying significantly greater vmin values than their fixed analogues. The surface tension of the water droplet also lifted loose, hydrophobic particles from the surface, forming highly mobile ‘liquid marbles'. Water-repellent soil was also shown to form ‘liquid marbles' at both the slow (approximately 0. 3 – 2. 1 m/s) and fast (about 7 m/s) <b>droplet</b> <b>impact</b> velocities studied.

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Droplet</b> <b>impact</b> {{dynamics}} {{is vital}} to the understanding of several phase-change and heat-transfer phenomena. This work examines the role of substrate elasticity on the spreading and retraction behavior of water <b>droplets</b> <b>impacting</b> flat and textured superhydrophobic substrates. Experiments reveal that droplet retraction on flat surfaces decreases with decreasing substrate elasticity. This trend is confirmed through a careful measurement of <b>droplet</b> <b>impact</b> dynamics on multiple PDMS surfaces with varying elastic moduli and comparison with impact dynamics on hard silicon surfaces. These findings reveal that surfaces tend to become more wettable upon <b>droplet</b> <b>impact</b> as the elastic modulus is decreased. First-order analyses are developed to explain this reduced retraction in terms of increased viscoelastic dissipation on soft substrates. Interestingly, superhydrophobic surfaces display substrate-elasticity-invariant impact dynamics. These findings are critical when designing polymeric surfaces for fluid−surface interaction applications. 1...|$|R

Furthermore, in most cases after validated against experimental data, they can be utilised to further explain the experimental measurements or to extend the experimental runs by performing “virtual” numerical experiments. In such “DNS” calculations of the dynamic topology of the interface between the liquid and gas phase, the selected dynamic contact angle treatment is a key parameter for the accurate prediction of the droplet dynamics. In the present paper, <b>droplet</b> <b>impact</b> phenomena on smooth, dry surfaces are simulated using three different contact angle treatments. For this purpose, an enhanced VOF-based model, that accounts for spurious currents reduction, which has been previously implemented in OpenFOAM CFD Toolbox, is utilised and further enhanced. Apart from the already implemented constant and dynamic contact angle treatments in OpenFOAM, the dynamic contact angle model of Kistler, that considers the maximum advancing and minimum receding contact angles, is implemented in the code. The enhanced VOF model predictions are initially compared with literature available experimental data of <b>droplets</b> <b>impacting</b> on smooth surfaces with various wettability characteristics. The constant contact angle treatment of OpenFOAM as well as the Kistler’s implementation show good qualitative and quantitative agreement with experimental results up to the point of maximum spreading, when the spreading is inertia dominated.

40|$|AbstractA Fast {{response}} surface temperature measurement technique {{has been developed}} to investigate transient transition boiling phenomena after ethanol <b>droplet</b> <b>impact</b> on a nickel hot surface. Our motivation is to make clear the mechanism of boiling transition between nucleate and film boiling which is closely related the recovery of wetting on the hot surface being higher than the Leidenfrost temperature. In this study transient boiling phenomena during sudden contact of an ethanol sessile droplet on a hot solid surface has been investigated to understand what governs whether the solid surface keeps wet or not. The <b>droplet</b> <b>impact</b> boiling system is very simple and easier to observe but it includes the elementary transition boiling process. Since the transient transition took place within a couple ten milliseconds, observation with high speed video system and fast {{response surface}} temperature measurement technique are essential for {{better understanding of the}} transition boiling phenomena. The experiments were conducted for single and multiple <b>droplet</b> <b>impacts.</b> The multiple <b>droplet</b> <b>impacts</b> simulates liquid and solid contact situations on a hot surface during spray or laminar jet quench. The nickel disk of 50 mm in diameter and 5 mm in thickness was used as the hot surface. The hot surface was inclined from 0 deg (horizontal) to 40 deg. The fast-response film thermocouple with a typical minimum response time of 80 microseconds was developed and fabricated on the nickel disk at the depth of 3 micrometers from the surface. The temperature histories just beneath the surface were recorded at the sampling frequency of 200 kHz. The boiling phenomena beneath a sessile <b>droplet</b> <b>impacted</b> on the hot surface were observed by using a microscope equipped with the high speed video camera at the maximum frame rate of 22. 5 kfps. The surface temperature and surface heat flux were estimated with 1 D inverse heat conduction analysis. Histories of local surface temperature and local heat flux were compared with the boiling video image. The experiments were done for different initial wall temperatures up to 250 °C, different liquid subcoolings from 33 to 53 K. The multiple impact frequency was changed from 280 to 840 Hz. In case of the single <b>droplet</b> <b>impact</b> tests, the observation results showed that wetting situation was maintained for very short time even though the surface temperature was beyond the liquid superheat limit temperature. We defined the vapor film generation time as the characteristic boiling transition time scale from wetted nucleation boiling regime to dry film boiling regime. The film generation time were measured for the extensive initial surface temperature range, different subcoolings and different impact velocities. As the initial surface temperature increased, the film generation time decreased to order of microsecond and film boiling situation seemed to be established via spontaneous nucleation (vapor explosion) process. In case of the multiple <b>droplets</b> <b>impact</b> tests, film generation times were evaluated every <b>droplet</b> <b>impact</b> during continuous cooling from the initial solid temperature. As long as the generation time was less than 1 millisecond and much shorter than the impact period, stable film boiling was observed. Then the film generation time increased with the <b>droplet</b> <b>impact</b> times and approached to the <b>droplet</b> <b>impact</b> period as the cooling time elapsed. This region was recognized as the transition boiling region. After the generation time reached to the <b>droplet</b> <b>impact</b> period and then stable wetted situation, namely nucleate boiling was observed. As compared with the single impact tests, the generation time for the multiple impact became shorter than that for the single <b>droplet</b> <b>impact</b> at same initial surface temperature and the lower limit surface temperature observed vapor film generation was reduced. This fact may imply the effect of transient heat conduction on the wetting temperature shifts to higher wall superheat temperature beyond liquid superheat limit temperature during quenching with jets or sprays...|$|R

40|$|The {{impact and}} {{spreading}} of picolitre-sized water droplets on a substrate is of importance in many {{applications such as}} rapid cooling, delayed freezing, crop spraying, and inkjet printing. In this thesis, the effects of substrate chemistry, roughness, hardness, charge, and porosity on such <b>droplet</b> <b>impact</b> are studied. The effect of roughness was investigated {{through the use of}} superhydrophobic CF 4 plasma fluorinated polybutadiene. Comparison of the maximum spreading ratio and droplet oscillation frequencies with literature models shows that both are found to be lower than theoretically predicted. Further study of the effect of multiple types of surface topography was carried out via the CF 4 plasma texturing of honeycomb surfaces, leading to hierarchical surfaces with roughness on two length scales. This led to the discovery that surfaces with similar static contact angles can give rise to different <b>droplet</b> <b>impact</b> dynamics, governed by the underlying surface topography. The effect of the mechanical properties of the substrate upon picolitre droplets can be important in microfluidics. The oscillatory dynamics of picolitre <b>droplets</b> following <b>impact</b> were found to depend upon the thickness and elasticity of the substrate. Higher oscillation frequencies are measured for softer and thicker films, which are correlated to larger surface deformations around the contact line. Static buildup during inkjet printing is known to affect print quality. The role of surface charge on picolitre <b>droplet</b> <b>impact</b> onto polymer substrates is found to give rise to increased <b>droplet</b> <b>impact</b> velocities. Higher surface potentials can result in unexpected behaviour such as droplet bouncing or increased contact area diameters leading to a decrease in print resolution. Printing on porous materials is important as porosity can aid ink adhesion and durability. CF 4 plasma fluorination of porous membranes can inhibit droplet spreading laterally over a surface, with little change in the imbibition behaviour in the material, leading to printing that is more highly defined. These hydrophobic membranes remain oleophilic and could also find use in oil–water separation. Similarly, a hydrophilic–oleophobic switching surface can be beneficial in a range of applications such as anti-fogging, self-cleaning, and oil– water separation.

Based on these characteristics, it is found that superhydrophobic carbon nanotube arrays are among the best water-repellent surfaces ever reported. The results presented herein may pave a way for the utilization of superhydrophobic carbon nanotube arrays in numerous industrial and practical applications, including inkjet printing, direct injection engines, steam turbines, and microelectronic fabrication...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{distribution}} profile of <b>droplets</b> <b>impacted</b> onto porous media as they simultaneously spread and absorb is paramount in coating science and engineering. Computational models of spreading or imbibing droplets have largely focused on flat surface profiles, though more recent models have also included topographical irregularity [e. g. 1, 2]. The research presented herein studies the combined influences of high impaction rates...|$|R
