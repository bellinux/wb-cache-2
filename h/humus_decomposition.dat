40|$|Scarification is {{a widely}} used {{silviculture}} method and is suggested to improve organic matter decomposition rate. In this study, I made {{the use of an}} experiment that buried humus material into mineral soil after clear-cuts and studied its effects on <b>humus</b> <b>decomposition</b> rate in four biogeoclimatic zones (CWH, ESSF, ICH and IDF) in British Columbia. Litterbags containing local humus materials (mixture of F and H layers) were placed on the forest floor surface or buried in the soil (5 - 10 cm deep). Samples were retracted annually and dry mass and carbon (C) content were measured to calculate the remaining C mass in each sample for three continuous years. The remaining C mass at all of four sites was lower when buried than placed on the surface, but the difference was significant only at the drier IDF site. Humus in forests with better climatic conditions, such as abundant precipitation and suitable temperature, responded weakly to burying. Stimulation of <b>humus</b> <b>decomposition</b> through scarification is most likely to occur in dry forests in B. C...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{recently}} {{shown that the}} presence of charcoal might promote <b>humus</b> <b>decomposition</b> in the soil. We investigated the decomposition rate of charcoal and litters of different biochemical quality mixed together in a soil incubation under controlled conditions. Despite the large range of organic substrate quality used in this study, we did not find any difference in the decomposition between the average of two individual substrates decomposing separately and the same substrates mixed together. We concluded that charcoal does not always promote other organic matter decomposition and that its particular effect might depend on various factors, for example, soil properties...|$|E

Furthermore, the load capacity, erosion sensitivity and water household of the soil are improved. However, avoiding {{the use of a}} plough brings certain challenges, especially in organic farming. For example, weed pressure can increase or nutrient supply can become insufficient. This leaflet shows benefits and challenges of reduced tillage.

50|$|Humic {{acids and}} fulvic acids, which begin as raw organic matter, are {{important}} constituents of humus. After {{the death of}} plants and animals, microbes begin to feed on the residues, resulting finally {{in the formation of}} <b>humus.</b> With <b>decomposition,</b> there is a reduction of water-soluble constituents, cellulose and hemicellulose, and nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. As the residues break down, only stable molecules made of aromatic carbon rings, oxygen and hydrogen remain in the form of humin, lignin and lignin complexes collectively called humus. While the structure of humus has few nutrients, it is able to attract and hold cation and anion nutrients by weak bonds that can be released into the soil solution in response to changes in soil pH.|$|R
5|$|Grasses such as sea {{couch grass}} and sea poa grass have an {{important}} function in the driest areas of the marshes, and on the coastal dunes, where marram grass, sand couch-grass, lyme-grass and grey hair-grass help to bind the sand. Sea holly, sand sedge, bird's-foot trefoil and pyramidal orchid are other specialists of this arid habitat. Some specialised mosses and lichens are found on the dunes, and help to consolidate the sand; a survey in September 2009 found 41 lichen species. The plant distribution {{is influenced by the}} dunes' age as well as their moisture content, the deposits becoming less alkaline as calcium carbonate from animal shells is leached out of the sand to be replaced by more acidic <b>humus</b> from plant <b>decomposition</b> products. Marram grass is particularly discouraged by the change in acidity. A similar pattern is seen with mosses and lichens, with the various areas of the dunes containing different species according to the acidity of the sand. At least four moss species have been identified as important in dune stabilization, since they help to consolidate the sand, add nutrients as they decompose, and pave the way for more exacting plant species. The moss and lichen flora of Blakeney Point differs markedly from that of lime-rich dunes on the western coasts of the UK. Non-native tree lupins have become established near the Lifeboat House, where they now grow wild.|$|R

In this study, six beech forests located in three areas of the centre of the Italian Apennine were studied to evaluate the microarthropod and ciliate communities, in order to evaluate their potential as a soil biodiversity reservoir. Microarthropod abundances, Acari/Collembola ratio, biodiversity indices and QBS-ar index were calculated. Microarthropod communities were found to be rich and well diversified in all of the six beech forests, characterized by typical groups generally present in woods with good natural conditions. The number of taxa ranged between 10 and 14 in the six forests and in all sites important groups such as Symphyla, Chilopoda, Pauropoda and Protura were present. Pseudoscorpiones were found in four forests while Isopoda were present only in two forests. Ciliate communities were investigated by means of qualitative and quantitative methods. Abundance, dominance, species diversity and C/P quotient (ratio of r-selected colpodean and kselected polyhymenophorean ciliates) were calculated. A total of 27 ciliate species belonging to 10 order, 14 families and 17 genera were recorded from three sites. Colpoda, Gonostomum and Spathidium were the dominant genus. Species richness ranged from 13 to 16 for all the sites. Biological quality and edaphic community composition highlighted the importance of beech forests in the protection policy of soil biodiversity...|$|R
40|$|Anthropogenic {{activities}} have globally increased nitrogen (N) deposition {{and carbon dioxide}} (CO₂) gas emissions. It is proposed that anthropogenic N deposition may {{increase the size of}} boreal forest CO₂ sink, because boreal ecosystems are N limited. Despite studies that have helped to clarify the magnitude by which N deposition enhances carbon (C) sequestration in the vegetation, there remains a paucity of studies evaluating how soils respond. This thesis aims to clarify the magnitude to which C sequestration in boreal forests responds to N enrichments, including rates that realistically simulated N deposition (≤ 12. 5 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹). This work was conducted in two long-term experiments in northern Sweden. The N treatments consisted of ambient, low N addition (3 - 12. 5 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) and high N addition (50 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) rates, in a Norway spruce and a Scots pine forest, maintained since 1996 and 2004, respectively. The organic soil C pool positively responded to N enrichment, especially at the high N addition level. This increase corresponded to a relationship between C sequestration and N addition of 10 kg C kg⁻¹ N. Further, low N addition treatments had no effect on microbial biomass and soil respiration (i. e. soil C outputs, microbial activity), while high N addition decreased total microbial, ectomycorrhizal fungal biomasses and soil respiration. The actinomycetes were the only microbes showing an increase with N addition. Annual litter production showed a minor impact on aboveground litter C inputs. Only mosses were the only major litter component showing significant quantitative and qualitative changes in response to N additions. Further, litter quality mediated by N enrichment was not the main driver of litter decomposition, while shifts in soil microbes strongly influence the early stages of litter decomposition. Low N addition rates had little effect on litter and <b>humus</b> <b>decomposition,</b> whereas high N addition rates impeded the early stage of decomposition of both substrates. The decline of litter decomposition appeared to be mediated by shifts in the abundance or community structure of saprophytic organisms, while the decrease of <b>humus</b> <b>decomposition</b> was likely the result of reduced ectomycorrhizal fungi. Altogether, the results of this thesis show that long-term N inputs simulating current atmospheric N deposition in the boreal region are likely to have subtle effects on the soil C balance and therefore on soil C accumulation...|$|E

This is the reason to why the authors dedicated the whole article 2 to functional considerations even before readers could go {{in the field and}} face the matter to be classified. Experienced lectors can overstep many of the sections reported in this article. If the titles of sections “ 1. A functional classification", " 2. What is a humus system?"and " 3.

Results were used to create regression models for prediction of liming impact on soil chemical properties. Liming and fertilization experiment was sat up in 20 L volume plastic pots with two types of acid soils with different texture from two sites. Ten liming and fertilization treatments were applied in four repetitions. Lime treatments increased soil pH values and decreased hydrolytic acidity. Mineral and organic fertilization affected additional soil acidification. Application of lime intensified mineralization and <b>humus</b> <b>decomposition,</b> while organic fertilization raised humus content. The results showed significant increase of AL-P 2 O 5 and K 2 O availability. The treatments increased soil Ca concentrations, {{but at the same time}} decreased exchangeable Mg concentrations. Soil pH increase resulted in lower Fe, Mn, Zn and Cu availability. Soil CEC was increased by applied treatments. Lime rates increased number and height of alfalfa plants, as well as yield of leaf, stalk increased concentrations of N, P, K and Ca in alfalfa leaf and stalk, but decreased leaf Mg and Fe, Mn, Zn and Cu concentrations. Regression computer models predicted with adequate accuracy P, Fe, Mn, Zn and Cu availability and final pH value as a result of liming and fertilization impact...|$|E
30|$|Soil {{microbial}} community {{is an essential}} component of the soil ecosystem. Soil microorganisms participate directly in the soil ecological processes including litter <b>decomposition,</b> <b>humus</b> formation, nutrient transformation and recycle, and waste degradation (De Deyn et al. 2004; Maila et al. 2005; Noah and Robert 2006). Soil microbial diversity and function are considered as important indicators for the assessment of soil quality as the microbial effects on soil ecological processes could further influence soil physicochemical properties, seedling regeneration, plant community development, and biodiversity (Onaindiaa et al. 2013; Owen et al. 2013; Sharma et al. 2011). The change of plant community in composition and structure often leads to the changes of soil {{microbial community}} in diversity and function. These changes would have certain impact on the ecological process of soil system that caused the change of plant community in turn (Mummey and Rillig 2006; Patrick 2006; Boudiaf et al. 2013). An introduction of forest species often changes obviously the composition, structure, species diversity, and productivity of plant community (Davies 2011; Omoro et al. 2010; Powell et al. 2013). As a result, the biomass, structure, and function of soil microorganism community are also influenced (Kourtev et al. 2002; Ravit et al. 2003; Chen et al. 2013). However, the effects of introduced forest species on soil microbial diversity and related ecological processes displayed inconsistent patterns as the effects were determined by many factors including plant growth characteristic, litter quality and quantity, roots and root secretions, phenology, climate condition, etc. (Ehrenfeld 2003; Chen et al. 2005; Steinlein 2013). Determining the effects of specific exotic plants in detail is critical to the sustainable forest management.|$|R
40|$|Biodiversity {{has been}} a focal aim of {{environmental}} protection since the Rio conference, but only {{with the beginning of}} the new millennium did soil biodiversity become an important aspect of international policy. Edaphic fauna {{play a key role in}} many soil functions, such as organic matter <b>decomposition,</b> <b>humus</b> formation and nutrient element cycling; moreover, affect the porosity, aeration, infiltration and distribution of organic matter in soil horizons, modifying soil structure and improving its fertility. The ecosystem services provided by soil animals are becoming progressively lost due to agricultural practice intensification, which causes a reduction in both abundance and taxonomic diversity of soil communities. In the present study, a permanent grassland habitat was studied in order to evaluate its potential as a soil biodiversity reservoir in agroecosystems. Grassland samples were compared with samples from a semi-natural woodland area and an arable land site. Microarthropod abundances, Acari/Collembola ratio (A/C), Shannon diversity index (H 0) and evenness index (E) were calculated. QBS-ar index was used in order to evaluate soil biological quality. Microarthropod communities of the three land use typologies differed in both the observed groups and their abundance. Steady soil taxa characterized both woodland and grassland soils, whereas their abundances were significantly higher in woodland soil. Taxon diversity and soil biological quality in the grasslands did not differ from the woodland samples. The microarthropod community in the arable land showed a reduction both in taxa numbers and soil biological quality compared with the other sites. Soil biological quality and edaphic community composition highlighted the importance of grassland habitats in the protection of soil biodiversity. JRC. H. 7 -Land management and natural hazard...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} under greenhouse conditions to study I) the dynamics over time of mineral N, mineralizable N and <b>humus</b> N during <b>decomposition</b> in soil of leguminous and non-leguminous plant material and ii) {{the impact of}} these changes on growth and N nutrition of wheat fertilized with 15 N-labelled ammonium sulphate. Finely ground straw of wheat, maize and sesbania was allowed to decompose in soil for 0, 2, 4 and 8 weeks. Sub-samples of soil were analyzed for the content of mineral N, mineralizable N and humus N. The bulk soil was sown to wheat and the plants harvested at maturity. Nitrogen as 15 N-labelled ammonium sulphate was applied in two split doses of 40 and 60 mg kg 1 soil. Accumulation of mineral N in soil during 8 weeks of residue decomposition was found to depend on the chemistry of plant residues, more mineral N being released in soil amended with plant residues with narrow C/N ratio i. e., maize and sesbania. These residues also contributed more to humus N and maintained a higher content of potentially mineralizable N. Wheat straw not only caused a net immobilization of N during 8 weeks of aerobic incubation but a substantially higher loss of NO 3 +NO 2 -N during subsequent incubation under submerged conditions. The loss of NO 3 +NO 2 -N was more where residues were given less time for decomposition. Plant residues applied immediately before sowing wheat or those allowed shorter period of decomposition had a negative effect on plant growth. Of the three residue types, wheat straw caused a higher reduction in plant growth. This was attributed mainly to significantly reduced availability to plants of soil-N, while uptake of fertilizer N was affected almost similarly by the three types of residues. Residues of maize and sesbania had a positive effect on grain yield and total biomass of wheat. As a whole, ca 30 % of the fertilizer N applied was taken up by the plants and > 40 % was unaccounted in the soil-plant system, fertilizer N remaining in soil being < 30 % of the applied. Relatively higher proportion of the applied N remained in amended than unamended soil after crop harvest...|$|R
40|$|Boreal forests harbour diverse fungal {{communities}} with decisive roles in decomposition and plant nutrition. Difficulties in studying soil fungi have limited knowledge about how fungal communities are shaped. The {{objective of this}} thesis was to study factors influencing soil fungal communities, aiming for increased understanding of their effect on environmental processes. Using next generation sequencing, responses of fungal communities to their physical-chemical environment, and responses of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi to logging, were investigated. In a trenching experiment, this technology, combined with measurements of decomposition and vertical nitrogen distribution, enabled evaluation of direct and indirect involvement of ECM fungi in <b>humus</b> <b>decomposition.</b> Fungal community composition {{was found to be}} significantly related to soil fertility, with ascomycetes dominating in less fertile forests, whereas basidiomycetes increased under more fertile conditions. ECM fungi were found to more or less disappear with complete clear-cutting and reestablishment of ECM diversity took several decades. However, a clear positive relationship between the amount of retention trees and ECM fungal species richness and abundance was found. By excluding ECM fungi, nitrogen limitation of saprotrophic fungi was released, increasing litter decomposition rates. However, this effect was overshadowed by an almost complete loss of oxidative enzyme activities in deeper humus layers, associated with removal of ECM fungi by trenching. Our results indicate ECM fungi to be the principal decomposers of boreal forest humus layers. This, together with the predictability of soil fungal communities, reinforces the importance and ability of integrating rhizosphere microorganisms, in particular ECM fungi, in forest ecosystem models...|$|E

As {{part of an}} effort to remediate NO 3 contamination in irrigated stream–aquifer systems, this study elucidates agricultural and environmental parameters and processes that govern NO 3 fate and transport at the regional (500 km 2), local (50 km 2), and field scales (2). Specifically, the revised Morris sensitivity analysis method was applied to a finite-difference nitrogen cycling and reactive transport model of a regional-scale study site in the lower Arkansas River valley in southeastern Colorado. The method was used to rank the influence of anthropogenic activities and natural chemical processes on NO 3 groundwater concentration, NO 3 mass leaching, and NO 3 mass loading to the Arkansas River from the aquifer. Sensitivity indices were computed for the entire study area in aggregate as well as each canal command area, crop type, and individual grid cells. Results suggest that fertilizer loading, crop uptake, and heterotrophic denitrification govern NO 3 fate and transport for the majority of the study area, although their order of influence on NO 3 groundwater concentration and mass leaching varies according to crop type and command area. Canal NO 3 concentration and rates of autotrophic denitrification, nitrification, and <b>humus</b> <b>decomposition</b> also dominate or partially dominate in other locations. Each factor, with the exception of O 2 reduction rate, is the dominating influence on NO 3 groundwater concentration at one or more locations within the study area.

40|$|Modelling of soil {{respiration}} {{plays an important}} role in the prediction of climate change. Soil respiration is usually divided in a fraction originating from root respiration and a heterotrophic fraction originating from microbial decomposition of soil organic carbon. This paper reports on the coupling of an one-dimensional water, heat and CO 2 flux model (SOILCO 2) with a pool concept of carbon turnover (RothC) for the prediction of soil heterotrophic respiration. In order to test this coupled model, it was applied to a bare soil experimental plot located in Bornim, Germany. Soil temperature and soil water content measurements were used for comparison with the respective model predictions. An 8 years data set Of CO 2 efflux measurements, covering a broad range of atmospheric conditions, was used to evaluate the model. In a first step we quantified the improvement of the CO 2 efflux prediction due to the coupling of the flux model with a pool concept of carbon turnover. The humus pool decomposition rate constant and its soil water content dependent reduction were derived from the first 5 years Of CO 2 efflux measurements using inverse modelling. The following 3 years of measurements were used to validate the model. The overall model performance Of CO 2 efflux predictions was acceptable with the measured and simulated mean daily respiration being 0. 861 and 0. 868 g C m(- 2) d(- 1), respectively, and a mean absolute difference between modelled and measured rates of 0. 21 g C m(- 2) d(- 1). The inverse estimation of the <b>humus</b> <b>decomposition</b> rate constant resulted in a value of 0. 04 year(- 1), which is higher than the default value in RothC. This is attributed to the agricultural practice during the experiment. (c) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|We {{used two}} {{datasets}} of 14 C analyses of archived soil samples to study carbon turnover in O horizons from spruce dominated old-growth stands on well-drained podsols in Scandinavia. The main data set {{was obtained from}} archived samples from the National Forest Soil Inventory in Sweden and represents a climatic gradient in temperature. Composite samples from 1966, 1972, 1983 and 2000 from four different regions in a latitude gradient ranging from 57 to 67 oN were analysed for 14 C content. Along this gradient the C stock in the O horizon ranges from 2. 1 kg m- 2 in the north to 3. 7 kg m- 2 in the southwest. The other data set contains 14 C analyses from 1986, 1987, 1991, 1996 and 2004 from the O horizons in Birkenes, Norway. Mean residence times (MRT) were calculated using a two compartment model, with a litter decomposition compartment using mass loss data from the literature for the three first years of decomposition and a <b>humus</b> <b>decomposition</b> compartment with a fitted constant turnover rate. We hypothesized that the climatic gradient would result in different C turnover {{in different parts of}} the country between northern and southern Sweden. The use of archived soil samples was very valuable for constraining the MRT calculations, which showed that there were differences between the regions. Longest MRT was found in the northernmost region (41 years), with decreasing residence times through the middle (36 years) and central Sweden (28 years), then again increasing in the southwestern region (40 years). The size of the soil organic carbon (SOC) pool in the O horizon was mainly related to differences in litter input and to a lesser degree to MRT. Because N deposition leads both to larger litter input and to longer MRT, we suggest that N deposition contributes significantly to the latitudinal SOC gradient in Scandinavia, with approximately twice as much SOC in the O horizon in the south compared to the north. The data from Birkenes was in good agreement with the Swedish dataset with MRT estimated to 34 years...|$|E
40|$|Charcoal is {{a natural}} product of {{wildfires}} which operate as a major natural disturbance in boreal forested ecosystems. This carbon (C) -rich material is present in most forest soils but its effects on ecosystem processes remain poorly understood. This thesis explores how charcoal, through its characteristics or traits, affects above- and belowground processes in the Swedish boreal forest by using laboratory mesocosm and glasshouse studies and a large field experiment. The relative importance of charring condition and species identity in determining charcoal traits was also investigated. These experiments covered {{a wide range of}} humus types, charcoal types and plant species in order to better understand the factors that determine the functional role of charcoal. With regard to aboveground processes, fire-derived charcoal promoted tree seedling growth but had only a minimal effect on seed germination, and plant community characteristics. Belowground processes such as <b>humus</b> <b>decomposition</b> and N mineralization rate were enhanced by the presence of charcoal, even though charcoal had minimal effect on microbial biomass and composition. Charcoal traits were shown to be affected primarily by species identity {{and to a lesser extent}} by charring conditions. The magnitude of charcoal effects was influenced by humus type, charcoal type and plant species identity. The mechanisms by which fire-derived charcoal affect ecosystem processes differed between above- and belowground processes; notably, while the effects of charcoal on aboveground processes were linked mostly to the direct input of phosphorus and especially PO 43 - from charcoal, its effect on belowground processes were mostly determined indirectly through its impact on microbial specific activity. These findings suggest that charcoal is likely to play a role in boreal forest succession, plant-soil feedbacks and ecosystem C dynamics. Moreover, the impacts of charcoal in boreal ecosystems are relevant to better understanding the ecological consequences of forest management practices such as site preparation, prescribed burning, fire suppression and biochar addition. Overall, the findings described in this thesis show that charcoal is a significant component of the C cycle and one that can have strong impacts on boreal ecosystem processes...|$|E
40|$|Ecosystem {{models are}} useful tools for {{evaluating}} environmental controls on carbon and water cycles under past or future conditions. In this paper we compare annual carbon and water fluxes from nine boreal spruce forest ecosystem models {{in a series}} of sensitivity simulations. For each comparison, a single climate driver or forest site parameter was altered in a separate sensitivity run. Driver and parameter changes were prescribed principally to be large enough to identify and isolate any major differences in model responses, while also remaining within the range of variability that the boreal forest biome may be exposed to over a time period of several decades. The models simulated plant production, autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration, and evapotranspiration (ET) for a black spruce site in the boreal forest of central Canada (56 °N). Results revealed that there were common model responses in gross primary production, plant respiration, and ET fluxes to prescribed changes in air temperature or surface irradiance and to decreased precipitation amounts. The models were also similar in their responses to variations in canopy leaf area, leaf nitrogen content, and surface organic layer thickness. The models had different sensitivities to certain parameters, namely the net primary production response to increased CO 2 levels, and the response of soil microbial respiration to precipitation inputs and soil wetness. These differences {{can be explained by the}} type (or absence) of photosynthesis-CO 2 response curves in the models and by response algorithms of litter and <b>humus</b> <b>decomposition</b> to drying effects in organic soils of the boreal spruce ecosystem. Differences in the couplings of photosynthesis and soil respiration to nitrogen availability may also explain divergent model responses.

40|$|Drying and {{subsequent}} rewetting of soils {{has been recognized}} as an important process for accelerating the decomposition of soil organic matter. This effect {{has been attributed to}} (1) increasing solubility of humic substances (molecular level) (2), microbial death during desiccation and due to osmoregulatory shock by rewetting {{and subsequent}} higher turnover through microbial regrowth (biotic level), and (3) release of protected organic matter by disruption of macroaggregates during rewetting due to ‘slaking' (soil structural level). We amended a loamy sand with 14 C-labelled Lolium perenne shoot material in which the effects of slaking were unlikely to be of importance. After 4 d some amended and unamended soils were dried at the temperature used for incubation (14 °C) to a pressure potential of − 3. 8 MPa. The soil remained structurally intact during the drying–rewetting, as in a field situation. This regime was chosen to ascertain that only the moisture conditions were changed. The imposed drying–rewetting regime did not result in a measurable increase in the rate of soil organic matter decomposition, but it possibly induced microbial death. It affected decomposition of added plant residues negatively, as shown by a significantly higher amount of residual 14 C in the dried and rewetted soils after 100 d of incubation compared to the continuously moist soils. In previous work the drying process was often accompanied by other physical changes, such as increasing temperature, and the drying–rewetting process was also accompanied by a manual perturbation of the soil fabric, such as spreading the soil in a thin layer before drying or homogenizing by sieving or mixing after rewetting. We performed a second experiment to test the effect of heating and manual disruption by sieving, on soil respiration and decomposition. This confirmed that the decomposition of recently added 14 C labelled material was retarded, whereas drying–rewetting per se apparently did not increase the decomposition of native SOM. Heating consistently increased respiration of native SOM in all treatments and combinations, whereas, as it could be expected in a sandy soil, the sieving treatment did not result in a considerable increase. This indicates that the effect of drying–rewetting per se on <b>humus</b> <b>decomposition</b> may be less than usually assumed. It is suggested that future work on this topic should pay attention to the drying regime, and especially to possible unintended artifacts due to heating or manual disruptions of the soil fabric...|$|E
