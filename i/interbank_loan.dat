5000|$|In the United States, {{federal funds}} are {{overnight}} borrowings between {{banks and other}} entities to maintain their bank reserves at the Federal Reserve. Banks keep reserves at Federal Reserve Banks to meet their reserve requirements and to clear financial transactions. Transactions in the federal funds market enable depository institutions with reserve balances in excess of reserve requirements to lend reserves to institutions with reserve deficiencies. These loans are usually made for one day only, that is, [...] "overnight". The interest rate at which these deals are done is called the federal funds rate. Federal funds are not collateralized; like eurodollars, they are an unsecured <b>interbank</b> <b>loan.</b>|$|E

Acharya et al show that during financial turmoil liquid banks in <b>interbank</b> <b>loan</b> markets do not lend their liquidity to illiquid banks, nor hoard liquidity for precautionary reasons, but, rather, hoard them to purchase assets at distress prices. Brunnermeier and [...] Pedersen study strategic behaviors of liquid traders {{when they know}} that other traders need to liquidate their positions. The study shows that the strategic behaviors would lead to predatory pricing, which would lead the price of risky and illiquid assets to fall further than they would if price were based on risk consideration alone.|$|E
40|$|Systemic risk {{in banking}} has gained renewed {{prominence}} in the literature in recent years. To date, empirical studies aimed at assessing the quantitative importance of systemic risk have analyzed the outcomes of historical banking crises. This paper takes a new tack by attempting to assess the level of systemic risk currently in a banking system {{on the basis of}} <b>interbank</b> <b>loan</b> structures. We construct a matrix of interbank loans for Switzerland based on known marginal loan distributions and the principle of entropy maximization. Our results suggest that the latent systemic risk associated with the <b>interbank</b> <b>loan</b> structure existing among Swiss banks in 1987 - 95 posed little threat to the stability of the Swiss banking system. ...|$|E

40|$|Preliminary, not for citing, or {{publishing}} Market {{discipline is}} usually {{studied in the}} markets for individual or firm deposits, leaving aside the <b>interbank</b> <b>loan</b> market. The banks ' ability to exert market discipline is taken for granted, as {{they are expected to}} have enough proficiency and expertise to assess correctly the riskiness of their counterparties. However, the "crises of trust "- as the one in 2004 in Russia- create some doubts on whether there exists some efficient peer monitoring and peer disciplining: the <b>interbank</b> <b>loan</b> market may be frozen in response to external information signal unrelated to banks ’ current reliability. This seems {{to be one of the}} reasons for the <b>interbank</b> <b>loan</b> markets to be extremely fragile during financial instability periods, undermining smooth functioning of the whole banking system, as the banks are tightly interconnected. Using the data from “Mobile” based on the bank financial statements collected by the Bank of Russia, we provide some evidence for market discipline in the Russian market for interbank loans. We show that the only mechanism that functions is the price-based one: more reliable banks enjoy lower interest rates. The quantitative discipline is, however, absent. The decisions on credit limits are based not on the changes in counterparty’s riskiness but on other information like reputation, soft information or public announcements that may be even unrelated to particular banks...|$|E

40|$|Banks use {{over-the-counter}} derivative (OTCD) contracts for sharing {{the risks of}} their asset streams. OTCDs are composed of an optimal combination of <b>interbank</b> <b>loans,</b> asset swaps and credit default swaps (CDS). The settlement of ex-post realized claims are renegotiated by participating banks after defaults {{by one or more}} banks to minimize the systemic impact of the default. The bailout by a solvent bank of an insolvent one creates a positive externality for all other solvent banks in the system with claims due from the insolvent bank. The lack of coordination among the solvent banks leads to an inefficient liquidation policy (system-wide runs) even though we allow mergers among them to potentially internalize the positive externality. <b>Interbanks</b> <b>loans</b> and CDS contracts have relatively lower incentive costs than swaps, but the former has the largest distress costs without renegotiations. With renegotiations, the payoffs of <b>interbank</b> <b>loans</b> and CDS are similar in strong bankruptcy regimes, while the latter dominate in weak regimes. Asset swaps provide the best hedging and are optimal for banks without incentive problems. Hedging with optimal OTCD contracts creates a tradeoff between the amount of credit risk and systemic risk (liquidation spillover) in the banking system...|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} multi-period general {{equilibrium}} model of bank deposit, credit, and interim <b>interbank</b> <b>loan</b> markets in which banks initially specialize in their choices of debtors, leading to underdiversi cation, but nevertheless become entwined via inter-bank markets, leading to the fortunes of one bank affecting the pro ts and default rates of {{the other in a}} sequential manner. Lack of (full) diversi cation among credit risks arises in our model owing to a relative pro t argument in each banker's utility function, which is otherwise risk- and default-averse.

Two different situations are analysed: in the first, the systemic risk in the Southern Region is {{higher than in the}} Northern one.

40|$|We analyze cascades of {{defaults}} in an <b>interbank</b> <b>loan</b> market. The novel {{feature of}} this study is that the network structure and the size distribution of banks are derived from empirical data. We find that the ability of a defaulted institution to start a cascade depends on an interplay of shock size and connectivity. Further results indicate that the ability to limit default risk by spreading the lending to many counterparts decreased with the financial crisis. To evaluate the influence of the network structure on market stability, we compare the simulated cascades from the empirical network with results from different randomized network models. The results show that the empirical network has non-random features, which cannot be captured by rewired networks. The analysis also reveals that simulations assuming homogeneity for size of banks and loan contracts dramatically overestimates the fragility of the interbank market...|$|E

We expand on earlier work on calendar-day effects in these markets, investigating also volumes of funding in recent years. Our data include daily trades in federal funds reported by major brokers and also records of uncollateralized transactions over the wire transfer system operated by the Federal Reserve. We find that the share of the overnight <b>interbank</b> <b>loan</b> market represented by brokered fed funds has decreased and is now only about one-third of the total. We also show evidence of close but incomplete arbitrage among the major segments of the overnight interbank market, though the specific calendar day patterns of spreads and volatilities have evolved relative to the literature using earlier sample periods.

40|$|We {{present a}} simple model, where intraday and {{overnight}} {{interest rates are}} linked by a no-arbitrage argument. The hourly interest rate is {{shown to be a}} function of the intraday term structure of the overnight rate. This property holds under both assumptions, where an explicit intraday market for interbank loans exists and when it does not. In the first case, such a property is an equilibrium condition; in the second one it holds by definition, as a synthetic hourly loan is a portfolio of overnight contracts. We then provide empirical evidence, based on tick- by-tick data for the e-MID money market (covering the whole 2003). The overnight rate shows a clear downward pattern throughout the operating day. A positive hourly interest rate emerges from the intraday term structure of the overnight rate: we estimate the market price of a one hour <b>interbank</b> <b>loan</b> to be slightly above a half basis point. intraday interest rate, overnight interbank loans, money market. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} new model of the {{liquidity}} driven banking system focusing on overnight <b>interbank</b> <b>loans.</b> This significant branch of the interbank market is commonly neglected in the banking system modeling and systemic risk analysis. We construct a model where banks are allowed to use both the interbank and the securities markets to manage their liquidity demand and supply as driven by prudential requirements in a volatile environment. The network of <b>interbank</b> <b>loans</b> is dynamic and simulated every day. We show how only the intrasystem cash fluctuations, without any external shocks, may lead to systemic defaults, what may be a symptom of the self-organized criticality of the system. We also analyze the impact of different prudential regulations and market conditions on the interbank market resilience. We confirm that central bank's asset purchase programs, limiting the declines in government bond prices, can successfully stabilize bank's liquidity demand. The model can be used to analyze the interbank market impact of macroprudential tools...|$|R
40|$|The recent fi nancial crisis saw a {{dramatic}} and persistent jump in interest rate spreads between overnight federal funds and longer-term <b>interbank</b> <b>loans.</b> The Fed took several actions to reduce these spreads including {{the creation of}} the Term Auction Facility (TAF).

40|$|We model {{a stylized}} banking system where banks are {{characterized}} {{by the amount of}} capital, cash reserves and their exposure to the <b>interbank</b> <b>loan</b> market as borrowers as well as lenders. A network of interbank lending is established that is used as a transmission mechanism for the failure of banks through the system. We trigger a potential banking crisis by exogenously failing a bank and investigate the spread of this failure within the banking system. We find the obvious result that the size of the bank initially failing is the dominant factor whether contagion occurs, but for the extent of its spread the characteristics of the network of interbank loans are most important. These results have implications for the regulation of banking systems that are briefly discussed, most notably that a reliance on balance sheet regulations is not suffcient but must be supplemented by considerations for the structure of financial linkages between banks...|$|E

Hence, {{we try to}} identify strong links by looking for preferential lending relationships expressed by discounts in the loan rate. Furthermore, we estimate the dynamics of credit spreads for each bank and find that economically significant spreads for the overnight market only developed in 2010. The analysis of bilateral loan relationships reveals that in the pre-crisis era large net borrowers used to borrow at a slight discount.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the euro unsecured interbank money market {{during the current}} financial crisis. To identify the loans traded in this market and settled in TARGET 2, we extend the algorithm developed by Furfine (1999) and adapt it to the European <b>interbank</b> <b>loan</b> market with maturity up to one year. This paper solves the problem of systematic errors which occur when you only look at overnight loans (as the Furfine algorithm does). These errors especially occur in times of (very) low interest rates. The algorithm allows us to track the actual interest rates rather than quoted interest rates on liquidity trading by participants of the Dutch part of the euro large value payment system (TARGET 2 -NL). The algorithm enables us to constitute the Dutch part of the EONIA, {{making it possible to}} compare the interest rates developments in the Dutch market to the European average ones.
