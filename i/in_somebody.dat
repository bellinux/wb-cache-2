Their relationship is described <b>in</b> <b>Somebody</b> Somewhere: Breaking Free from the World of Autism and Like Colour to the Blind: Soul Searching and Soul Finding; and {{he appeared in}} television documentaries with her. On 9 December 2000, while living in England, Williams married Chris Samuel. In 2002, the couple moved to her native Australia.

25|$|Newman's {{first film}} for Hollywood was The Silver Chalice (1954). The film was a box office failure and the actor would later {{acknowledge}} his disdain for it. In 1956, Newman garnered much attention and acclaim {{for the role}} of Rocky Graziano <b>in</b> <b>Somebody</b> Up There Likes Me. In 1958, he starred in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958), opposite Elizabeth Taylor. The film was a box office smash and Newman garnered his first Academy Award nomination. Also in 1958, Newman starred in The Long, Hot Summer with Joanne Woodward, with whom he reconnected on the set in 1957 (they had first met in 1953). He won Best Actor at the 1958 Cannes Film Festival for this film.|$|E
25|$|In February 1954, Newman {{appeared}} in a screen test with James Dean, directed by Gjon Mili, for East of Eden (1955). Newman was tested {{for the role of}} Aron Trask, Dean for the role of Aron's fraternal twin brother Cal. Dean won his part, but Newman lost out to Richard Davalos. That same year, he co-starred with Eva Marie Saint and Frank Sinatra in a live—and color—television broadcast of Our Town, a musical adaptation of Thornton Wilder's stage play. Newman was a last-minute replacement for James Dean. The Dean connection had resonance two other times, as Newman was cast in two leading roles originally earmarked for Dean, as Billy the Kid in The Left Handed Gun and as Rocky Graziano <b>in</b> <b>Somebody</b> Up There Likes Me, both filmed after Dean's death in an automobile collision.|$|E

25|$|In late 1955, {{at the age}} of 25, McQueen left New York {{and headed}} for California, where he moved into a house on Vestal Avenue in the Echo Park area, seeking acting jobs in Hollywood. When McQueen {{appeared}} in a two-part television Westinghouse Studio One presentation entitled The Defenders, Hollywood manager Hilly Elkins (who managed McQueen's first wife, Neile) took note of him and decided that B-movies would be a good place for the young actor to make his mark. He landed his first film role in a bit part <b>in</b> <b>Somebody</b> Up There Likes Me, directed by Robert Wise and starring Paul Newman. McQueen was subsequently hired for the films Never Love a Stranger, The Blob (his first leading role) which depicts a flesh eating amoeba-like space creature, and The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery.|$|E

500|$|The network–ugh–they're {{so stupid}} sometimes. The shows [...] were doing good, they weren't big hits, {{but they were}} doing good.

It's wrong. I don't think it's a good idea. But they wanted to bring <b>in</b> <b>somebody</b> else {{as the head of the}} hospital. They wanted his [...] mother to be head of the hospital and his conflicts would be with her and I just didn't think it was right. I didn't want to write it. I just didn't want to do it [...] I didn't. Someone else came in. It was a big thing with the network. They cancelled The Paul Lynde Show and put Paul in Temperatures Rising." ...|$|E

500|$|Throughout the video, Jackson shows {{a sexual}} {{attraction}} towards the dancing woman—played by Sybil Azur. Jackson caresses her ankle, calf, knee and thigh, {{and at one}} stage looks up her dress. The woman is then seen opening a flick knife as the pair engage in a final courtship dance. The video closes {{in the same manner}} it began, with the switchblade impaling the spray painted image. The music video won the Brazilian TVZ Video Award: Best International Music Video of the Year. Interviewed on her experience during the video one of the dancers, Carmit Bachar (of The Pussycat Dolls) noted, [...] "I was called in by Vincent Paterson for 'Blood on the Dance Floor'. It was to have a Latin feel, some sort of mambo. I arrived wearing a little salsa dress, fish nets, heels, and my hair was up in a kind of bun with a flower. I was 'camera ready'. I showed up with the whole outfit. It's not that producers can't see what they like, or the potential <b>in</b> <b>somebody,</b> but what I do helps them to see their vision more".|$|E
500|$|Lovato {{collaborated with}} Beckett on a song titled [...] "For the Love of a Daughter". Although not {{planning}} to write a personal song, a [...] "really long talk" [...] with Beckett resulted in the song being written. The song chronicles Lovato's relationship with her estranged birth father, who left the family when she was two years old. In the song, she pleads with her father to [...] "put the bottle down" [...] and questions him: [...] "How could you {{put your hands on}} the ones that you swore you loved?" [...] The song was set to appear on the album, but Lovato and her management felt of the song's subject would be too much for her young audience and later was removed from the album. In an interview with Women's Wear Daily, she explained: [...] "When I took a step back, I realized I wouldn't like those subjects being talked about <b>in</b> <b>somebody</b> else's home, with a seven-year-old and their mom." [...] Several other [...] "emotional" [...] songs were also put on hold. The song was later selected and included on her third studio album Unbroken released in September 2011, when Lovato had left Disney Channel.|$|E
500|$|The main {{themes in}} the album, in Adams words are; [...] "searching for something". The lyrical meaning behind track number four, [...] "Oxygen" [...] is what a person needs in order to survive. In other words, [...] "The person you are with is giving you the air you breathe", and that people in general [...] "need each other 100%." [...] The album's first single, [...] "I Thought I'd Seen Everything" [...] is about keeping an open mind." [...] The theme of [...] "Broken Wings" [...] is about [...] "somebody who {{taught me how to}} fly", a metaphor which for [...] "putting your trust <b>in</b> <b>somebody</b> who can give you faith and the belief that you can succeed." [...] "Something to Believe In" [...] is based upon the {{affirmation}} of life and faith, while [...] "Walk on By" [...] warns the listener of distrustfulness. As with other albums, according to Adams, he likes to end the album with a melancholic song, such as [...] "Something to Believe In" [...] in 11, it's not the last track however. [...] "Flowers Gone Wild" [...] touches on the same theme as two songs he wrote in the early 1980s, [...] "Cover Girl" [...] and [...] "The Best Is Yet To Come", are based upon the murdered playboy bunny Dorothy Stratten. But also people with misplaced emotions and their unfulfilled needs, which are pushed forth by the media, which Adams says, leads people to lose their [...] "sense of decency". Adams explained further; [...] "It's a sort of new love affair with an old story, devouring our celebrities and leaving them when we are done." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Much Apu About Nothing" [...] {{was written}} by David S. Cohen and {{directed}} by Susie Dietter. Joe Mantegna guest stars in the episode as Fat Tony. Much of {{the inspiration for the}} episode came from news reports of bears roaming streets in Southern California around the time when the episode was in production. Cohen said that when a bear swims <b>in</b> <b>somebody's</b> pool or goes <b>in</b> <b>somebody's</b> garbage can, it becomes a popular news item in California. The show runner of The Simpsons at the time, Bill Oakley, commented that the news reports often create an anti-bear hysteria, {{and that is one of}} the inspirations for the episode.|$|R
