[...] "Through explaining the last two albums time and time again, I just started to become weary of the topic, and I started to feel like I was losing my connection to {{the music and the}} lyrics simply from having repeated it so many times [...] I feel there's a lot of emphasis these days placed on explaining everything in such a fashion that there's really nothing left for the listener or reader to explore themselves. It's all spelled out," [...] Turner continues. [...] "So it's interesting to leave some of that stuff open-ended so they have to <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> legwork themselves."

I assure you it is excellent fun, and I did it partly to spite that minx, Paulina, and that bear, Dr. John: to show them that, with all their airs, I could get married as well as they. M. de Bassompierre was at first in a strange fume with Alfred; he threatened a prosecution for 'détournement de mineur,' and I know not what; he was so abominably in earnest, that I found myself forced to <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> the melodramatic--go down on my knees, sob, cry, drench three pocket-handkerchiefs. Of course, 'mon oncle' soon gave in; indeed, where {{was the use of}} making a fuss? I am married, and that's all about it. He still says our marriage is not legal, because I am not of age, forsooth! As if that made any difference! I am just as much married as if I were a hundred. However, we are to be married again, and I am to have a trousseau, and Mrs. Cholmondeley is going to superintend it; and there are some hopes that M. de Bassompierre will give me a decent portion, which will be very convenient, as dear Alfred has nothing but his nobility, native and hereditary, and his pay. I only wish uncle would do things unconditionally, in a generous, gentleman-like fashion; he is so disagreeable as to make the dowry depend on Alfred's giving his written promise that he will never touch cards or dice from the day it is paid down. They accuse my angel of a tendency to play: I don't know anything about that, but I do know he is a dear, adorable creature.|$|E

5000|$|In this arc, Whedon sets up {{a number}} of new {{paradigms}} in the Buffy universe for the forthcoming Season Nine comic book series, the ongoing Angel and Faith spin-off series, and the Willow mini-series. Buffy destroying the seed effectively means [...] "No more magic in the sense of not so much entirely convenient magic". According to Whedon, it was his choice to [...] "dim" [...] the world of the show [...] "a little bit. Possibly because that’s how I feel about it, or at least this country in the last 10 years. And I wanted to <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a reset, where things seem more back down to earth." [...] When Season Eight began, Whedon wanted to make full use of the comic book medium's potentials. For example, he introduced Giant Dawn, which he felt fit the universe's tone and [...] "was the right kind of problem for Dawn to have". Ultimately however, Whedon felt that Buffy was less about the scope of its stories; he describes the show's [...] "mission statement" [...] as “What does this feel like?”, and therefore ultimately decided to take the series back to the [...] "real world". Season Nine more closely resembled the television series, and dwelled as it did more on Buffy's interiority and less on the [...] "cavalcade of mythology", as Season Eight did. The change also made Buffy an underdog again, and no longer an overlord; Whedon commented that fans typically prefer Buffy in that role.
