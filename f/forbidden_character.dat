40|$|In this contribution, we have {{investigated}} {{the performance of the}} initial hardness response, a reactivity index from conceptual DFT, in the prediction of the allowed or <b>forbidden</b> <b>character</b> of a series of sigmatropic hydrogen shifts, which are traditionally explained using the famous Woodward-Hoffmann rules for pericyclic reactions. Previously, it was observed that this quantity can be linked to the activation hardness of a chemical reaction and, in this case, thus to the aromaticity of the transition state in these kinds of reactions. It is shown, both by considering approximate reaction coordinates and intrinsic reaction coordinates that the allowed mode of the sigmatropic rearrangement corresponds to the largest value of the initial hardness response, in agreement with earlier work on cycloadditions and electrocyclizations...|$|E
40|$|X ray {{absorption}} XAS and resonant {{inelastic scattering}} RIXS {{of a number}} of Mn 2, 3, 4 complexes relevant for photo electrooxidation of water is studied theoretically using the RASSCF RASSI approach. This enables us to quantify spin orbit coupling induced mixing of states with different multiplicities in the valence and core excited electronic states, evidencing the mostly spin <b>forbidden</b> <b>character</b> of transitions in RIXS spectra. The notably different patterns of spectroscopic features in this series of substances not only provide insight into their electronic structure but open the possibility for tracing redox evolution by means of X ray spectroscopy. Specific findings deduced from the analysis of the shape of the RIXS spectra concern the gap between the ground and first excited valence states relevant for catalytic activity. This gap is substantially lower for Mn 3 as compared to the even oxidation state...|$|E
40|$|The {{alkylbenzene}} derivatives (R) -PhCH(CH 3) tBu (1) and (R) -PhCH(CH 3) iPr (2) {{were taken}} as paradigms of chiral benzene compounds and their vibronic electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectrum in the 1 Lb band region analyzed in detail. The 1 Lb ECD band of chiral benzene compounds {{is often used}} to assign absolute configurations on the basis of sector rules. However, 1 Lb ECD bands of several benzene derivatives are associated with a <b>forbidden</b> <b>character</b> and show marked vibrational progressions strongly modulating their shape. This is also true for compounds 1 and 2, the latter also showing a peculiar thermochromism. The low-temperature ECD spectrum of 2 displays in fact an alternation of positive and negative ECD maxima. Vibronic ECD calculations performed within a TDDFT scheme allowed a full rationalization of the observed ECD spectra of 1 and 2. Especially in the case of 2, the ECD spectrum in the 1 Lb band region results from a complex balance of Franck-Condon and Herzberg-Teller effects, as well as of conformational factors. Therefore, straightforward sector rules cannot be safely used to assign the absolute configuration of even these simple derivatives...|$|E

40|$|Many aspects in the {{regulation}} of photosynthetic light-harvesting of plants are still quite poorly understood. For example, {{it is still a}} matter of debate which physical mechanism(s) results in {{the regulation}} and dissipation of excess energy in high light. Many researchers agree that electronic interactions between chlorophylls (Chl) and certain states of carotenoids are involved in these mechanisms. However, in particular, the role of the first excited state of carotenoids (Car S- 1) is not easily revealed, because of its optical <b>forbidden</b> <b>character.</b> The use of two-photon excitation is an elegant approach to address directly this state and to investigate the energy transfer in the direction Car S- 1 -> Chl. Meanwhile, it has been applied to a large variety of systems starting from simple carotenoid-tetrapyrrole model compounds up to entire plants. Here, we present a systematic summary of the observations obtained by two-photon excitation about Car S- 1 -> Chl energy transfer in systems with increasing complexity and the correlation to fluorescence quenching. We compare these observations directly with the energy transfer in the opposite direction, Chl -> Car S- 1, for the same systems as obtained in pump-probe studies. We discuss what surprising aspects of this comparison led us to the suggestion that quenching excitonic Car-Chl interactions could contribute to the regulation of light harvesting, and how this suggestion can be connected to other models proposed...|$|E
40|$|Heterogeneous nitrates {{photolysis}} is {{the trigger}} for many chemical processes {{occurring in the}} polar boundary layer and is widely believed to occur in a quasi-liquid layer (QLL) at the surface of ice. The dipole <b>forbidden</b> <b>character</b> of the electronic transition relevant to boundary layer atmospheric chemistry and the small photolysis/photoproducts quantum yields in ice (and in water) may confer a significant enhancement and interfacial specificity to this important photochemical reaction at the surface of ice. Using amorphous solid water films at cryogenic temperatures as models for the disordered interstitial air/ice interface within the snowpack suppresses the diffusive uptake kinetics thereby prolonging the residence time of nitrate anions at the surface of ice. This approach allows their slow heterogeneous photolysis kinetics to be studied providing the first direct evidence that nitrates adsorbed onto the first molecular layer at the surface of ice are photolyzed more effectively than those dissolved within the bulk. Vibrational spectroscopy allows the ~ 3 -fold enhancement in photolysis rates to be correlated with the nitrates’ distorted intramolecular geometry thereby hinting at {{the role played by}} the greater chemical heterogeneity in their solvation environment at the surface of ice than in the bulk. A simple 1 D kinetic model suggests 1 -that a 3 (6) -fold enhancement in photolysis rate for nitrates adsorbed onto the ice surface could increase the photochemical NO[subscript 2] emissions from a 5 (8) nm thick photochemically active interfacial layer by 30 %(60) %, and 2 -that 25 %(40 %) of the NO[subscript 2] photochemical emissions to the snowpack interstitial air are released from the top-most molecularly thin surface layer on ice. These findings may provide a new paradigm for heterogeneous (photo) chemistry at temperatures below those required for a QLL to form at the ice surface...|$|E
