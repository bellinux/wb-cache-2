5|$|After Zainab and Jane {{argue in}} the street Zainab and Yusef return home. Zainab slaps Yusef after he says Kamil will be an outcast to him but Yusef slaps Zainab back. Yusef then hastily {{arranges}} a flight for himself, Zainab and Kamil to Pakistan, but Zainab purposefully discards her passport to prevent the trip. Yusef then kidnaps Kamil, telling Zainab that he is being kept <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>place</b> and refuses to let Zainab see him. After about four days of not knowing, Yusef takes Zainab to a café in the High Street, where a relative returns Kamil to Zainab. During the visit, it emerges that Yusef told Bushra's family that Zainab had a nervous breakdown, {{which is why he}} needed to have Kamil looked after. When Yusef takes a call outside the café, Zainab tries to escape with Kamil through an emergency exit {{in the back of the}} shop. However, Yusef guessed her plan and was waiting for her outside the exit. As she tried to escape, Yusef warned her that he knows everything, and if she leaves him, he will kill Tamwar and Kamil. Masood races to the restaurant and secretly promises that he'll do whatever it takes to get her out of her marriage to Yusef. Zainab finally stands up to Yusef and refuses to leave for Pakistan. Yusef attacks her and after learning that Masood has Kamil, retaliates towards Yusef. Yusef drugs Zainab, and the family return to the house. Masood punches Yusef before calling the police. Afia confronts Yusef and orders him to leave. Yusef is later found by Masood at the bed and breakfast with a match and some petrol. Yusef attacks Masood and lights a fire leaving Masood for dead. Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) and Christian put the fire out but the fire is later reignited trapping Masood, Phil and Denise inside. Yusef taunts Zainab outside. Zainab lies and tells him that Afia is in the building and he runs in followed by Tamwar. Masood is later rescued and as Yusef remains upstairs he realises that Afia is in fact outside. Realising Zainab tricked him, he briefly smiles, and the floor collapses beneath him and he succumbs to the flames, killing him. The following day, firefighters retrieve his body. He leaves everything to Zainab in his will.|$|E

25|$|While {{growing up}} Davis {{was known as}} Little Pops. His second home was the Phyllis Wheatley {{settlement}} house. Its director Gertrude Brown gave the area's children continuing education <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>place</b> to go after school. Davis must have gotten into trouble at some point {{as it was a}} juvenile parole officer who suggested he attend Phyllis Wheatley. There with his friends, Davis learned boxing, etiquette and Robert's Rules of Order. They met Chick Webb and danced to Duke Ellington and Count Basie who stayed there on tours to the Orpheum Theatre. In 1941, he graduated from North High School where he lettered in and won a city championship in boxing. Davis attended the University of Minnesota and later in life received an honorary doctorate in law from Macalester College.|$|E
25|$|A {{school of}} higher {{education}} had long been an aspiration of the colonists. An early attempt at Henricus failed after the Indian Massacre of 1622. The location at {{the outskirts of the}} developed part of the colony had left it more vulnerable to the attack. In the 1690s, the colonists tried again to establish a school. They commissioned Reverend James Blair, who spent several years in England lobbying, and finally obtained a royal charter for the desired new school. It was to be named the College of William & Mary in honor of the monarchs of the time. When Reverend Blair returned to Virginia, the new school was founded <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>place,</b> Middle Plantation in 1693. Classes began in temporary quarters in 1694, and the College Building, a precursor to the Wren Building, was soon under construction.|$|E

25|$|The taboos (Tanacross injih, Upper Tanana įhjih) are animistic forbidden. In {{addition}} to adhering to {{a code of}} behavior, people observed a variety of taboos designed to prevent misfortune or bad luck. Many of these taboos were associated with hunting or some other aspect of the food gathering process, thus underscoring {{the importance of these}} activities for survival of the group. Ravens, cranes, wolverines, foxes, otters, and dogs must never be eaten. The heads of caribou, moose, and Dall sheep may not be fed to the dogs; to do so would bring the hunter poor luck. Neither the bones nor the carcasses of fur-bearing animals may be fed to dogs, but must be cached <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>place.</b> Should the dogs get them tha hunter will take no more fur. Women of child-bearing age did not eat bear (Grizzly or Alaskan brown bear and black bear). Young boys could not eat fat from around an animal's eye until adulthood. No animals except dogs could be brought up as pets.|$|E
25|$|Attached ticks {{should be}} removed promptly, as removal within 36 hours can reduce {{transmission}} rates. Folk remedies for tick removal tend to be ineffective, offer no advantages in preventing the transfer of disease, and may increase the risks of transmission or infection. The best method is simply to pull the tick out with tweezers {{as close to the}} skin as possible, without twisting, and avoiding crushing the body of the tick or removing the head from the tick's body. The risk of infection increases with the time the tick is attached, and if a tick is attached for less than 24 hours, infection is unlikely. However, since these ticks are very small, especially in the nymph stage, prompt detection is quite difficult. The Australian Society of Clinical Immunology recommends against using tweezers to remove ticks but rather to kill the tick first by using a product to rapidly freeze the tick to prevent it from injecting more allergen-containing saliva. In a tick allergic person, the tick should be killed and removed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>place</b> (e.g. an emergency department of a hospital).|$|E

The eyes {{are close to the}} sides of the scutum, and the large spiracles are located just behind the coxae of the fourth pair of legs. The hard, protective scutellum, characteristic of this family, covers the whole dorsal surface in males but is restricted to a small, shield-like structure behind the capitulum in females and nymphs. They differ, too, in their life cycle; Ixodidae that attach to a host bite painlessly and generally unnoticed, and they remain in place until they engorge and are ready to change their skin; this process may take days or weeks. Some species drop off the host to moult <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>place,</b> whereas others remain on the same host and only drop off once they are ready to lay their eggs.|$|E

2500|$|The fox is {{sometimes}} referred to as vermin but it is not categorized as such by The UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). Some farmers fear the loss of their smaller livestock, while others consider them <b>an</b> ally <b>in</b> controlling rabbits, voles, and other rodents, which eat crops. A key reason for dislike of the fox by pastoral farmers is their tendency to commit acts of surplus killing toward animals such as chickens, yet having killed many they eat only one. [...] Some anti-hunt campaigners maintain that provided it is not disturbed, the fox will remove all of the chickens it kills and conceal them <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>safer</b> <b>place.</b>|$|R
500|$|As d'Avalos's troops, marching from Ceresole, {{began to}} {{arrive on the}} battlefield, both armies {{attempted}} to conceal their numbers and position from the other; Enghien had ordered the Swiss to lie on the ground behind {{the crest of the}} ridge, while only the left wing of the Imperial army was initially visible to the French. D'Avalos sent out parties of arquebusiers in an attempt to locate the French flanks; Enghien, in turn, detached about 800 arquebusiers under Montluc to delay the Imperial advance. The skirmishing between the arquebusiers continued for almost four hours; Martin Du Bellay, observing the engagement, described it as [...] "a pretty sight for anyone who was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>place</b> and unemployed, for they played off on each other all the ruses and stratagems of petty war." [...] As the extent of each army's position was revealed, Enghien and d'Avalos both brought up their artillery.

2500|$|The Madonna {{remained}} in Essen throughout World War I but was again evacuated in its aftermath. After the communist revolt in the Ruhr {{area in the}} spring of 1920, the authorities of St. Johannes parish, fearing another uprising, decided to hide the statue <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>place</b> that would be unknown even to its own priest so as to prevent discovery by treason or extortion. A goldsmith from Aachen was assigned to find a hiding place, and he finally negotiated with another German diocese that the Madonna {{and the rest of the}} Essen treasure was to be concealed in a place that only the goldsmith and a designated guardian would know about: even the bishop was only informed about the general plan, but not about the exact location of the sanctuary. A document detailing the whereabouts was deposited in a Dutch diocese in case the middleman was killed. The plan worked so well that to this day it is unknown where exactly the treasure was hidden at that time. The only certainty is that it was packed in shabby cardboard suitcases and taken to some place in the Diocese of Hildesheim. The voucher deposited in the Netherlands was destroyed after the treasure was finally brought back to Essen in 1925 when the political situation seemed stable. In the summer of 1925 the goldsmith from Aachen and his son retrieved the treasure from its sanctuary and brought it back to Essen, travelling in a fourth-class Reichsbahn carriage and carrying the treasure inconspicuously as hand luggage.|$|E

50|$|It {{was first}} {{mentioned}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> deed of 748. The rapids {{that gave the}} town the name (Laufen = rapid running waters) were also responsible for the town's wealth from the salt trade. Small boats that transported the extremely valuable cargo from the rapids north of Salzburg were reloaded at Laufen to larger boats by privilege of the Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg. When the independent principality was finally divided in 1816 between the Bavarian kingdom and the Habsburg Empire {{in the wake of}} the Napoleonic Wars, the town was split into a Bavarian part carrying the name of Laufen and into an Austrian town (the former Laufen suburbs on the right hand side of the river) by the name of Oberndorf. With the building of railways by the middle of the 19th century the transport of salt on the river Salzach came to an end, taking away the former source of wealth. A number of floods devastated both towns by the end of the century. The flood of 1899 destroyed the old bridge.

40|$|Women {{and girls}} are disproportionately {{affected}} by sexual and gender based violence. Living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> conflict affected state or being displaced from one’s home increases that vulnerability. There are numerous potential health issues that sexual and gender based violence can cause or aggravate. The situational instability in conflict and displacement settings can {{make it difficult for}} women to access services to treat these conditions. This can lead to poor physical, mental, and sexual and reproductive health outcomes for women who have survived acts of sexual and gender based violence. Leaving her home country and applying for refugee status <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>safer</b> <b>place</b> does not guarantee that a woman who has experienced sexual and gender based violence will have access to health care to treat any health issues and have better health outcomes. Female migrants in the European Union are consistently less healthy than native populations are. This is a result of vaguely worded policies regarding migrant health packages, the structure of the European Union, and the competing interests of the twenty-eight member states. Cultural differences and language barriers between female migrants and health practitioners can make it difficult to build trust and rapport between these groups, which ultimately can lead to lower service utilisation among migrant populations...|$|R
