5|$|Daoism and Buddhism {{were the}} {{dominant}} religions of China in the Song era, the latter deeply impacting many beliefs {{and principles of}} Neo-Confucianism throughout the dynasty. Ironically, Buddhism came under heavy criticism by staunch Confucian advocates and philosophers of the time. Older beliefs in ancient Chinese mythology, folk religion, and ancestor worship also played a large part in people's daily lives, as the Chinese believed that deities and <b>ghosts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spiritual realm frequently interacted with the living realm.|$|E
5|$|The 2000 {{expedition}} by RMS Titanic Inc. {{carried out}} 28 dives during which over 800 artefacts were recovered, including the ship's engine telegraphs, perfume vials and watertight door gears. In 2001, an American couple – David Leibowitz and Kimberly Miller – caused controversy {{when they were}} married aboard a submersible that had set down on the bow of Titanic, in a deliberate echo of a famous scene from James Cameron's 1997 film. The wedding was essentially a publicity stunt, sponsored by a British company called SubSea Explorer which had offered a free dive to Titanic that Leibowitz had won. He asked whether his fiancée could come too {{and was told that}} she could– but only if she agreed to get married during the trip. The same company also brought along Philip Littlejohn, the grandson of one of Titanics surviving crew members, who became the first relative of a Titanic passenger or crew member to visit the wreck. Cameron himself also returned to Titanic in 2001 to carry out filming for Walt Disney Pictures' <b>Ghosts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Abyss, filmed in 3D.|$|E

5|$|The {{emotional}} {{character of}} the ceremonies around the memorials changed as grieving took place and many individuals, inevitably, continued with their lives. Some early ceremonies around memorials {{were believed to be}} closely associated with spiritual events. The opening of the Menin Gate memorial, for example, inspired Will Longstaff's dream that led to the famous Menin Gate at Midnight painting, portraying the fallen dead rising and walking through the gateway, while the Cenotaph ceremonies were photographed in 1922, and believed by some to show the <b>ghosts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war dead. Indeed, early ceremonies at the London Cenotaph after the war were felt to be particularly emotional; commentators felt that by the late 1920s, the events were more formal and less fraught with emotional than previously. Initially foreign diplomats in Britain were expected to lay wreaths on Armistice Day; this requirement was reviewed in the 1930s. In Australia, there were initially many local ceremonies at memorials on Anzac Day specifically for bereaved mothers; by the 1930s, these had been discontinued and incorporated into the wider ceremonial occasion.|$|E

50|$|Due {{in part to}} its {{isolated}} and undeveloped nature, the Pine Barrens have encouraged various folk legends.

There are also folk tales concerning the Blue Hole, an unusually clear blue and rounded body of water located in the Pine Barrens between Monroe Township, Gloucester County, New Jersey and Winslow Township, Camden County, New Jersey, often associated with the Jersey Devil.|$|R

25|$|Ghosts in the {{classical}} world often appeared {{in the form of}} vapor or smoke, but at other times they were described as being substantial, appearing as they had been at the time of death, complete with the wounds that killed them. Spirits of the dead appear in literature as early as Homer's Odyssey, which features a journey to the underworld and the hero encountering the <b>ghosts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead, as well as the Old Testament in which the Witch of Endor calls the spirit of the prophet Samuel.|$|E
25|$|Hogwarts {{is home to}} {{at least}} twenty ghosts, but when people in the novels speak of the ghosts at Hogwarts they are usually {{referring}} {{to one of the}} four resident <b>ghosts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hogwarts houses: Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington (or, as the students refer to him, Nearly Headless Nick), the almost beheaded host of Gryffindor house; the Bloody Baron, who is the ghost of Slytherin house; the jovial Fat Friar, who is the ghost of Hufflepuff house; and the Grey Lady, who is the ghost of Ravenclaw house. These ghosts seem to act as something like advisers and aides to the students; Nick is frequently seen helping Harry during moments of uncertainty or crisis.|$|E
