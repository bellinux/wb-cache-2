5|$|As to Captain Benbow, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> no {{difference}} between him and me, nor have we had any. He has no small obligation to me, but being called {{in some of the}} foolish printed papers ‘the famous Captain Benbow’, I suppose has put him a little out of himself, and has made him play the fool, as I guess, in some of his letters. I will not farther now particularize this business, but time will show I have not been in the wrong, unless being too kind to an ungrateful man.|$|E
5|$|On atheism, Sagan commented in 1981: An atheist {{is someone}} who is certain that God does not exist, someone who has {{compelling}} evidence against the existence of God. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> no such compelling evidence. Because God can be relegated to remote times and places and to ultimate causes, {{we would have to}} know a great deal more about the universe than we do now to be sure that no such God exists. To be certain of the existence of God and to be certain of the nonexistence of God seem to me to be the confident extremes in a subject so riddled with doubt and uncertainty as to inspire very little confidence indeed.|$|E

25|$|Many {{have said}} that a vacuum does not exist, others that it does exist {{in spite of the}} repugnance of nature and with {{difficulty}}; <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> no one who has said that it exists without difficulty and without a resistance from nature. I argued thus: If there can be found a manifest cause from which the resistance can be derived which is felt if we try to make a vacuum, it seems to me foolish to try to attribute to vacuum those operations which follow evidently from some other cause; and so by making some very easy calculations, I found that the cause assigned by me (that is, the weight of the atmosphere) ought by itself alone to offer a greater resistance than it does when we try to produce a vacuum.|$|E
500|$|Although {{several women}} {{claimed to be}} the model for September Morn, Chabas never {{revealed}} her identity. He described the work as [...] "all <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> painting", and responded positively to statements that it was his masterpiece. Later writers, however, have described the painting as kitsch, valuable only as a historic artifact.|$|E

500|$|Adams was {{appointed}} in 1785 the first American {{minister to the}} Court of St James's (ambassador to Great Britain). When a counterpart seemed to assume that Adams had some family members in England, Adams replied, [...] "Neither my father or mother, grandfather or grandmother, great grandfather or great grandmother, nor any other relation that <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>of,</b> or care a farthing for, has been in England these {{one hundred and fifty}} years; so that you see I have not one drop of blood in my veins but what is American." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Tearjerker" [...] was {{a tribute}} to Nirvana lead singer Kurt Cobain. Kiedis felt Cobain's death [...] "was an {{emotional}} blow, and we all felt it. I don't know why everyone on earth felt so close to that guy; he was beloved and endearing and inoffensive in some weird way. For all of his screaming {{and all of his}} darkness, he was just lovable." [...] "My Friends" [...] addressed more of Kiedis' own somber thoughts rather than those of [...] "his friends": [...] "My friends are so distressed/And standing on the brink of emptiness/No words <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> to express/This emptiness." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1800s, William Tudor wrote that Boston was [...] "“perhaps {{the most perfect}} and {{certainly}} the best-regulated democracy that ever existed. There is something so impossible in the immortal fame of Athens, that the very name makes everything modern shrink from comparison; but {{since the days of}} that glorious city <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> none that has approached so near in some points, distant as it may still be from that illustrious model.” [...] From this, Boston has been called the [...] "Athens of America" [...] (also a nickname of Philadelphia) for its literary culture, earning a reputation as [...] "the intellectual capital of the United States." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Pratchett's {{assistant}} Rob Wilkins, Pratchett left [...] "an awful lot" [...] of unfinished writing, [...] "10 titles <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> and fragments {{from many}} other bits and pieces." [...] In the past, Pratchett himself mentioned {{at least two}} texts, Scouting for Trolls, and a Discworld novel centering on a new character. The notes left behind outline ideas about [...] "how the old folk of the Twilight Canyons solve the mystery of a missing treasure and defeat {{the rise of a}} Dark Lord despite their failing memories", [...] "the secret of the crystal cave and the carnivorous plants in the Dark Incontinent", about Constable Feeney of the Watch, first introduced in Snuff, involving how he [...] "solves a whodunnit among the congenitally decent and honest goblins", and on a second book about Amazing Maurice from The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents.|$|E
500|$|To {{replace the}} [...] "Italian" [...] style of Trapattoni, Koeman wanted Benfica {{to have a}} [...] "Dutch" [...] approach; he said, [...] "A team like Benfica always has to play to win. In what <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> this team, we can {{perfectly}} play in a 4–3–3," [...] and that finding the right balance between offence and defence in the playing style mattered. Vital to his new formation, Koeman asked for more wingers, such as Andy van der Meyde, and Boudewijn Zenden, but Benfica did not sign them. Instead, he received attacking midfielders Diego Souza, Andrei Karyaka and Giorgos Karagounis. To improve Koeman's options up-front, composed of Nuno Gomes and Mantorras, Benfica tried but failed to sign Jon Dahl Tomasson. Koeman instead received Italian international Fabrizio Miccoli on loan from Juventus. In defence, Benfica added Brazilians Anderson, Léo, with Nélson [...] replacing Miguel, who moved to Valencia.|$|E
500|$|However, in 1993, Jackson told Oprah Winfrey [...] "there, as <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>of,</b> {{there is}} no such thing as skin bleaching. [...] I've never seen it, I don't know what it is." [...] It was in this {{interview}} that Jackson stated he had a skin disorder (vitiligo) and also stated that the disorder was hereditary, rather than something he caused; he also said he used make-up to even out the uneven skin tone. [...] "It is something I cannot help," [...] explained Jackson. [...] "When people make up stories that I don't want to be who I am, it hurts me. It's a problem for me. I can't control it. But what about all the millions of people who sit in the sun to become darker, to become other than what they are. Nobody says nothing about that." [...] Winfrey's interview of Jackson was watched by 62million Americans. It also started a public discourse on the topic of vitiligo, a relatively unknown condition before then.|$|E

500|$|In 1835, Congress had {{authorized}} branch mints at Charlotte, North Carolina, Dahlonega, Georgia, and New Orleans, Louisiana, {{to strike}} into American coin the gold being mined in or {{entering the country}} through the South. [...] Despite the rich gold deposits nearby, both Charlotte and Dahlonega were in areas lacking men with technical training; accordingly trained personnel {{would have to be}} sent from Philadelphia. [...] New buildings were to be constructed. In August 1837, Mint Director Patterson received word of problems at both sites, including a partial collapse of the Dahlonega building. He wrote to Treasury Secretary Levi Woodbury, proposing [...] "to send, to both the Gold mints, a confidential & skillful person, who may... give instructions as to correcting the errors, that have been committed... <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> no one competent to this task, except our Melter & Refiner, Mr. Peale." [...] Woodbury agreed, informing Patterson, [...] "you are authorized to send Mr. Peak." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1913, Chabas {{stated that}} he was [...] "pained and humiliated" [...] by the {{controversy}} over September Morn, though he later expressed more positive views. He described the work as [...] "all <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> painting", and responded positively to statements {{that it was his}} masterpiece. In a 1914 interview, he explained that he had not meant to sell the painting, as it [...] "was [...] wife's favorite picture". At {{the time of his death}} in 1937, Chabas had only a single picture in his room: a reproduction of the painting, completed from memory; he had boasted [...] "If I had never seen it from the day I put down my brushes after painting it, I could make a perfect copy." [...] However, not having copyrighted the work, he did not receive any royalties from the marketing frenzy in the United States; he recalled, [...] "Nobody was thoughtful enough even to send me a box of cigars." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{campaign}} and loss left Lenore in emotional pain. [...] In her election night remarks she had said, [...] "I thought [...] {{would be an}} asset. It was disappointing to find that many people closed their minds just because I was a woman." [...] She expounded on this in an article she published the following year in Look magazine, describing the openly dismissive reaction she had gotten from both men and women. She wrote that, [...] "In factories, I encountered men in small groups, laughing, shouting, 'Get in the kitchen. George needs you there. What {{do you know about}} politics?'" [...] To a friend she wrote, [...] " [...] how open and bare and wide my own vulnerability would be ... the body wounds are deep." [...] She told one of her children that she wished she had not run, and concluded that [...] "It's the most humiliating thing <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> to run for office." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{spite of}} Washington's pleas, Mason {{remained}} in Virginia, plagued by illness and heavily occupied, {{both on the}} Committee of Safety and elsewhere in defending the Fairfax County area. [...] Most of the legislation Mason introduced in the House of Delegates was war related, often aimed at raising the men or money needed by Congress for Washington's Continental Army. The new federal and state governments, short on cash, issued paper money. By 1777, the value of Virginia's paper money had dropped precipitously, and Mason developed a plan to redeem the notes with a tax on real estate. Due to illness, Mason was three weeks late in arriving at Richmond, to the frustration of Washington, who had faith in Mason's knowledge of financial affairs. The general wrote to Custis, [...] "It is much to be wished that a remedy {{could be applied to}} the depreciation of our Currency... <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> no person better qualified to do this than Colonel Mason".|$|E

Peacock has the appointment at his disposal & if he can not find a man willing to take the office, the opportunity will probably be lost— Capt. F. wants a man (I understand) more as a companion than a mere collector & would not take any one however good a Naturalist who was not recommended to him likewise as a gentleman. ... there never was a finer chance for a man of zeal & spirit... Don't put on any modest doubts or fears about your disqualifications for I assure you I think you are the very man they are in search of.|$|E
500|$|Cast member Wil Wheaton rewatched {{the episode}} for AOL TV in November 2006. He criticised {{the writing of}} Fontana in this episode, saying that around this time she {{appeared}} on a panel at a convention about how to solve [...] "The Wesley Problem", but when rewatching the episode he thought that [...] "maybe instead of sitting on this panel and trashing me, D.C Fontana could have written intelligent dialogue for me and helped solve the [...] "Wesley problem" [...] herself. I don't know, maybe she {{tried to do that}} and didn't get a lot of support {{from the rest of the}} producers and writing staff, but even <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> Dr. Channing's theory of not writing cliched dialogue for kids in science fiction, and then blaming the actor who is forced to deliver it." [...] Overall he criticised the [...] "very stiff" [...] dialogue throughout the episode, and called the set-up [...] "incredibly forced". He did highlight that Data acting out as Sherlock Holmes laid the foundation of future episodes which would expand on this.|$|E
