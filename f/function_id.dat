50|$|If no {{response}} is {{received from the}} device's function #0, the bus master performs an abort and returns an all-bits-on value (FFFFFFFF in hexadecimal), which is an invalid VID/DID value, thus a device driver can tell that the specified combination bus/device_number/function (B/D/F) is not present. So, when a read to a <b>function</b> <b>ID</b> of zero for a given bus/device causes the master (initiator) to abort, it must then be presumed that no working device exists on that bus because devices are required to implement function number zero. In this case, reads to the remaining functions numbers (1 - 7) are not necessary as they also will not exist.|$|E

We demonstrate that the promoter of ID 4 is consistently methylated to various degrees in CLL cells, and increased promoter methylation in a univariable analysis correlates with shortened patient survival. However, ID 4 mRNA and protein expression is uniformly silenced in CLL cells irrespective of the degree of promoter methylation. The crossing of ID 4 +/− mice with Eμ-TCL 1 mice triggers a more aggressive murine CLL as measured by lymphocyte count and inferior survival. Hemizygous loss of ID 4 in nontransformed TCL 1 -positive B cells enhances cell proliferation triggered by CpG oligonucleotides and decreases sensitivity to dexamethasone-mediated apoptosis. Collectively, this study confirms the importance of the silencing of ID 4 in murine and human CLL pathogenesis...|$|E
40|$|We {{put forward}} a new theory aiming {{to account for the}} {{interpretation}} of the English intensifier (i. e. himself as in John himself met Mary). We show that its interpretation is regulated by the interplay between information structure, semantics and surrounding context. More concretely, we propose (a) that the intensifier can assume any role of the component of information structure, which we assume to consist of the autonomous notions of [contrast], [topic] and [focus] (Neeleman and van de Koot 2008, Neeleman and Vermeulen 2010); (b) that the intensifier always denotes an identity <b>function</b> (<b>ID)</b> which takes a nominal constituent x as its argument and maps it onto itself (Eckardt 2001, Hole 2002, Gast 2006). and (c) that specific contextual (both sentential and pragmatic) factors can influence its interpretation. The theory assumes only one lexical entry for the intensifier and derives its properties through independently motivated assumptions, thus claiming superiority at least over polysemous analyses (i. e. Edmondson and Plank 1978, König 1991, Siemund 2000, Eckardt 2001). This proposal also undermines accounts that assume one lexical entry but derive each use of the intensifier from its structural position (i. e. Gast 2006) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} {{natural systems}} of fundamental sequences for ordinals below the Howard Bachmann ordinal and study {{growth rates of}} the resulting slow growing hierarchies. We consider a specific assignment of fundamental sequences which depends on a non negative real num-ber ε.

We show further that the resulting slow growing hierarchy exhausts the provably recursive <b>functions</b> of <b>ID</b> 1 if ε is strictly greater than zero. Fi-nally we show that the resulting fast growing hierarchies exhaust the provably recursive <b>functions</b> of <b>ID</b> 1 for all non negative values of ε. Our result is somewhat surprising since usually the slow growing hierar-chy along the Howard Bachmann ordinal exhausts precisely the provably recursive functions of PA.

40|$|Abstract—The most {{significant}} barrier to improving passive RFID tag performance for both fixed <b>function</b> <b>ID</b> tags and enhanced RFID tags is the limitation {{on the amount}} of power that can be harvested for operation. This paper presents a novel approach for incorporating solar harvesting capability into existing passive RFID tags without increasing the parts count or changing the tag assembly process. Our approach employs the tag’s antenna as a dual function element in which the antenna simultaneously harvests RF energy, communicates with the RFID reader, and harvests solar energy for auxiliary power. This is accomplished by using low cost, printable photovoltaics deposited on flexible substrate to form part of the antenna’s radiating structure. Several prototype UHF RFID antennas are demonstrated using commercially available thin film, amorphous solar cells. To quantify the improvement in tag performance, Intel’s WISP was used as an initial test vehicle. The effective read range of the tag was increased by six times and exceeded the reader’s sensitivity limitations. Additionally, the new antenna allowed for sensing and computing operations to take place independent of the RFID reader under typical office lighting conditions...|$|E

Id 1 −/− stromal cells showed altered production of cytokines in vitro, and cytokine levels were deregulated in vivo, which could account for the Id 1 −/− hematopoietic phenotypes.

In this paper we give a new characterization of finite order-polynomially lattices. We consider doubly irreducible monotone functions and point out their relation to tolerances, especially to central relations. We introduce chain-compatible lattices and show {{that they have a}} non-trivial congruence if they contain a finite interval and an infinite chain. The consequences are two new results. A modular lattice L with a finite interval is order-polynomially complete if and only if L is finite projective geometry. If L is simple modular lattice of infinite length then every nontrivial interval is of infinite length and has the same cardinality as any other nontrivial interval of L. In the last sections we show the descriptive power of polynomial functions of lattices and present several applications in geometry...|$|E

40|$|The {{multi-domain}} transcriptional coactivators CBP/p 300 integrate {{a multitude}} of signaling inputs, interacting with more than 400 proteins via {{one or more of}} their globular domains. While CBP/p 300 function is typically considered in terms of these structured domains, about half of the protein consists of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of varying length. However, these IDRs have only been thought of as linkers that allow flexible spatial arrangement of the structured domains, but recent studies have shown that similar IDRs mediate specific and critical interactions in other proteins. To examine the roles of IDRs in CBP, we performed yeast-two-hybrid screenings of placenta and lung cancer cDNA libraries, which demonstrated that the long IDR linking the KIX domain and bromodomain of CBP (termed ID 3) can potentially bind to several proteins. The RNA-binding Zinc-finger protein 106 (ZFP 106) detected in both libraries was identified as a novel substrate for CBP-mediated acetylation. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy combined with cross-linking experiments and competition-binding assays showed that the fully disordered isolated ID 3 transiently interacts with an IDR of ZFP 106 in a fashion that disorder of both regions is maintained.

Available evidences suggest that presence of ID region/domain within a transcription factor {{plays an important role}} in its biological <b>functions.</b> These <b>ID</b> sequences provide large flexible surfaces that can allow them to make more efficient physical and functional interactions with their target partners. Since transcription factors regulate expression of target genes by interacting with specific coregulatory proteins, these ID regions/domains can be used as a platform for such large macromolecular interactions, and may represent a mechanism for regulation of cellular processes. The precise structural basis for the <b>function</b> of these <b>ID</b> regions/domains of the transcription factors remains to be determined. In the recent years there has been growing evidence suggesting that an induced fit-like process leads to imposition of folded functional structure in these ID domains on which large multiprotein complexes are built.
