5|$|Another {{example of}} the {{structural}} similarity of some inhibitors to the substrates of the enzymes they target {{is seen in the}} figure comparing the drug methotrexate to folic acid. Folic acid is a substrate of <b>dihydrofolate</b> <b>reductase,</b> an enzyme involved in making nucleotides that is potently inhibited by methotrexate. Methotrexate blocks the action of <b>dihydrofolate</b> <b>reductase</b> and thereby halts the production of nucleotides. This block of nucleotide biosynthesis is more toxic to rapidly growing cells than non-dividing cells, since a rapidly growing cell has to carry out DNA replication, therefore methotrexate is often used in cancer chemotherapy.|$|E
5|$|NAD is also {{a direct}} target of the drug isoniazid, which {{is used in the}} {{treatment}} of tuberculosis, an infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Isoniazid is a prodrug and once it has entered the bacteria, it is activated by a peroxidase enzyme, which oxidizes the compound into a free radical form. This radical then reacts with NADH, to produce adducts that are very potent inhibitors of the enzymes enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase, and <b>dihydrofolate</b> <b>reductase.</b> In one experiment, mice given NAD for one week had improved nuclear-mitochrondrial communication.|$|E
40|$|Trimethoprim {{resistance}} in the Enterobacteriaceae {{has been dominated by}} the spread of two genes encoding different <b>dihydrofolate</b> <b>reductases</b> (types IA and II). The original carriage of these genes was by transferable bacterial plasmids. Now, however, one of these genes is often found to be located on the bacterial chromosome. Two new plasmid-mediated <b>dihydrofolate</b> <b>reductases</b> have been identified. One of these enzymes (type IV) confers a low degree of insusceptibility but is inducible, to give levels 600 times higher than the bacterial host enzyme. The technique used to demonstrate the plasmids that carry the gene for this enzyme suggests {{that they would not be}} identified by the plasmid transfer methods in current use...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{existence}} of two distinct <b>dihydrofolate</b> <b>reductases</b> (DHFR) in highly trimethoprim-resistant clinical isolates has been unequivocally demonstrated. The enzymes have been characterized {{with regard to}} the affinity for substrates and sensitivity to inhibitors. The chromosomal, trimethoprim-sensitive DHFR was purified to homogeneity by a new simple two-step procedure. Its N-terminal amino acid sequence, determined up to the first 35 amino acids, showed 69 % homology with the Escherichia coli DHFR...|$|R

When mouse fibroblasts were exposed to these {{recombinant plasmid}}s, it was possible to select methotrexate-resistant clones that had integrated the plasmids and produced a chimeric RNA coding for the prokaryotic enzyme...|$|R
5|$|A {{competitive}} inhibitor and substrate cannot bind to {{the enzyme}} {{at the same}} time. Often competitive inhibitors strongly resemble the real substrate of the enzyme. For example, the drug methotrexate is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme <b>dihydrofolate</b> <b>reductase,</b> which catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate. The similarity between the structures of dihydrofolate and this drug are shown in the accompanying figure. This type of inhibition can be overcome with high substrate concentration. In some cases, the inhibitor can bind to a site other than the binding-site of the usual substrate and exert an allosteric effect to change {{the shape of the}} usual binding-site.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes are not rigid, static structures; {{instead they}} have complex {{internal}} dynamic motions – that is, {{movements of parts}} of the enzyme's structure such as individual amino acid residues, groups of residues forming a protein loop or unit of secondary structure, or even an entire protein domain. These motions {{give rise to a}} conformational ensemble of slightly different structures that interconvert with one another at equilibrium. Different states within this ensemble may be associated with different aspects of an enzyme's function. For example, different conformations of the enzyme <b>dihydrofolate</b> <b>reductase</b> are associated with the substrate binding, catalysis, cofactor release, and product release steps of the catalytic cycle.|$|E
25|$|This {{antagonistic}} {{effect is}} not due to the inhibition of <b>dihydrofolate</b> <b>reductase,</b> the enzyme responsible for the reduction of dihydrofolic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid, but rather to defective folate metabolism.|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of metioprim, a new competitive inhibitor {{of bacterial}} <b>dihydrofolate</b> <b>reductases,</b> were studied after a single oral dose of 100 mg in two young healthy subjects, four elderly volunteers, and eight patients with impaired renal function. The pharmacokinetic parameters of unchanged metioprim were derived by analyzing plasma level curves using a two-compartment model. Plasma half-lives determined for the beta phase were 10. 5 to 11. 5 h in young volunteers, 12. 0 to 12. 9 h in elderly subjects, and 13. 2 to 15. 3 h {{in patients with}} renal impairment.

40|$|Trypanosomatid protozoans {{depend upon}} {{exogenous}} sources of pteridines (pterins or folates) for growth. A broad spectrum pteridine reductase (PTR 1) was recently identified in Leishmania major, whose sequence places {{it in the}} short chain alcohol dehydrogenase protein family although its enzymatic activities resemble <b>dihydrofolate</b> <b>reductases.</b> The properties of PTR 1 suggested a role in essential pteridine salvage {{as well as in}} antifolate resistance. To prove this, we have characterized further the properties and relative roles of PTR 1 and dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase in Leishmania pteridine metabolism, using purified enzymes and knockout mutants. Recombinant L. major and Leishmania tarentolae, and native L. major PTR 1 s, were tetramers of 30 -kDa subunits and showed simila...|$|R
40|$|Environments {{polluted}} {{by direct}} discharges of effluents from antibiotic manufacturing are important reservoirs for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), which {{could potentially be}} transferred to human pathogens. However, our knowledge about the identity and diversity of ARGs in such polluted environments remains limited. We applied functional metagenomics to explore the resistome of two Croatian antibiotic manufacturing effluents and sediments collected upstream of and at the effluent discharge sites. Metagenomic libraries built from an azithromycin-production site were screened for resistance to macrolide antibiotics, whereas the libraries from a site producing veterinary antibiotics were screened for resistance to sulfonamides, tetracyclines, trimethoprim, and beta-lactams. Functional analysis of eight libraries identified a total of 82 unique, often clinically relevant ARGs, which were frequently found in clusters and flanked by mobile genetic elements. The majority of macrolide resistance genes identified from matrices exposed {{to high levels of}} macrolides were similar to known genes encoding ribosomal protection proteins, macrolide phosphotransferases, and transporters. Potentially novel macrolide resistance genes included one most similar to a 23 S rRNA methyltransferase from Clostridium and another, derived from upstream unpolluted sediment, to a GTPase HflX from Emergencia. In libraries deriving from sediments exposed to lower levels of veterinary antibiotics, we found 8 potentially novel ARGs, including <b>dihydrofolate</b> <b>reductases</b> and beta-lactamases from classes A, B, and D. In addition, we detected 7 potentially novel ARGs in upstream sediment, including thymidylate synthases, <b>dihydrofolate</b> <b>reductases,</b> and class D beta-lactamase. Taken together, in addition to finding known gene types, we report the discovery of novel and diverse ARGs in antibiotic-polluted industrial effluents and sediments, providing a qualitative basis for monitoring the dispersal of ARGs from environmental hotspots such as discharge sites of pharmaceutical effluents...|$|R
25|$|Certain {{sulfonamides}} (sulfadiazine or sulfamethoxazole) {{are sometimes}} {{mixed with the}} drug trimethoprim, which acts against <b>dihydrofolate</b> <b>reductase.</b> As of 2013, the Republic of Ireland is the largest exporter worldwide of sulfonamides, accounting for approximately 32% of total exports.|$|E
25|$|The pathway {{leading to}} the {{formation}} of tetrahydrofolate (FH4) begins when folic acid (F) is reduced to dihydrofolate (DHF) (FH2), which is then reduced to THF. <b>Dihydrofolate</b> <b>reductase</b> catalyses the last step. Vitamin B3 in the form of NADPH is a necessary cofactor for both steps of the synthesis. Thus, hydride molecules are transferred from NADPH to the C6 position of the pteridine ring to reduce folic acid to THF.|$|E
25|$|Many {{studies have}} found no {{association}} between lamotrigine exposure in utero and birth defects, while those that have found an association have found only slight associations with minor malformations like cleft palates. Review {{studies have found}} that overall rates of congenital malformations in infants exposed to lamotrigine in utero are relatively low (1-4%), which is similar to the rate of malformations in the general population. It is known that lamotrigine is a weak inhibitor of human <b>dihydrofolate</b> <b>reductase</b> (DHFR) and other, more powerful, human DHFR inhibitors like methotrexate are known to be teratogenic.|$|E
40|$|<b>Dihydrofolate</b> <b>reductases</b> {{from the}} folate-requiring strains Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 8043, Lactobacillus casei ATCC 7496, and Pediococcus cerevisiae ATCC 8081, {{as well as}} from Lactobacillus arabinosus, which is not {{dependent}} on exogenous folate, were isolated, and their properties were compared to reductases of Escherichia coli B, Staphylococcus aureus, and rat liver reductase. An inhibition profile with six different inhibitors revealed significant differences among all enzymes. All lactobacilli reductases are less sensitive to trimethoprim than the enzymes of E. coli and S. aureus, the reductase of P. cerevisiae requiring a concentration at least 1, 000 times higher for 50 % inhibition. Inhibition of growth of S. faecalis by pyrimethamine and 2, 4 -diamino- 6, 7 -diisopropyl-pteridine was seen to be much stronger than was predicted from the enzymatic data...|$|R
40|$|Methotrexate (MIX) dose-escalation {{studies were}} {{conducted}} in two inbred lines of FVB/N transgenic mice expressing distinct drug-resistant <b>dihydrofolate</b> <b>reductases</b> (DHFRs) and in animals transplanted with transgenic marrow. Survival of animals ex-pressing a tryptophan- 31 variant DHFR transgene was only slightly improved over that of normal animals, and survival of tryptophan- 31 variant DHFR marrow transplant recipients was indistinguishable from that of normal animals (at a MTX dose of 4 mg/kg i. p. daily). In contrast, extended survival was observed for animals expressing an arginine- 22 variant (Arg 22) DHFR transgene, with the last three of eight animals in this group succumbing at a final MTX dose of 14 mg/kg i. p. daily. Survival was slightly reduced for normal animals transplanted with Arg 22 marrow. Interestingly, demise of animals in both Arg 2...|$|R
40|$|We report here solvent kinetic isotope {{effects for}} two <b>dihydrofolate</b> <b>reductases,</b> namely the monomeric, {{mesophilic}} enzyme from E. coli (EcDHFR) and the dimeric, thermophilic enzyme from Thermotoga maritima (TmDHFR). Multiple isotope effects reveal mechanistic {{differences between the}} two enzymes. EcDHFR follows a stepwise mechanism in which proton transfer precedes hydride transfer, whereas the two steps are concerted in TmDHFR. At elevated pH, EcDHFR also follows a concerted reaction pathway. TmDHFR at pH 7 behaves more like EcDHFR at elevated pH suggesting that the restricted motions of TmDHFR resulting from dimerization preclude it from modulating the pKa of its substrate as efficiently as EcDHFR. The reduced reaction rates of TmDHFR therefore appear to be a consequence of its quaternary structure, which is required for increased thermostability but which also prevents active modulation of the reactivity of the active site bound substrate observed in EcDHFR...|$|R
25|$|Methotrexate is an {{antimetabolite}} of the antifolate type. It {{is thought}} to affect cancer and rheumatoid arthritis by two different pathways. For cancer, methotrexate competitively inhibits <b>dihydrofolate</b> <b>reductase</b> (DHFR), an enzyme that participates in the tetrahydrofolate synthesis. The affinity of methotrexate for DHFR is about 1000-fold that of folate. DHFR catalyses the conversion of dihydrofolate to the active tetrahydrofolate. Folic acid is needed for the denovo synthesis of the nucleoside thymidine, required for DNA synthesis. Also, folate is essential for purine and pyrimidine base biosynthesis, so synthesis will be inhibited. Methotrexate, therefore, inhibits the synthesis of DNA, RNA, thymidylates, and proteins.|$|E
25|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} {{are typically}} made by cell culture that involves fusing myeloma cells with mouse spleen cells immunized with the desired antigen. Rabbit B-cells {{can be used}} to form a rabbit hybridoma. Polyethylene glycol is used to fuse adjacent plasma membranes, but the success rate is low, so a selective medium in which only fused cells can grow is used. This is possible because myeloma cells have lost the ability to synthesize hypoxanthine-guanine-phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT), an enzyme necessary for the salvage synthesis of nucleic acids. The absence of HGPRT is not a problem for these cells unless the de novo purine synthesis pathway is also disrupted. Exposing cells to aminopterin (a folic acid analogue, which inhibits <b>dihydrofolate</b> <b>reductase,</b> DHFR), makes them unable to use the de novo pathway and become fully auxotrophic for nucleic acids, thus requiring supplementation to survive.|$|E
25|$|Lamotrigine {{does not}} have {{pronounced}} effects {{on any of the}} usual neurotransmitter receptors (adrenergic, dopamine D1 and D2, muscarinic, GABA, histaminergic H1, serotonin 5-HT2, and N-methyl-D-asparate). Inhibitory effects on 5-HT, norepinephrine, and dopamine transporters are weak. Lamotrigine is a weak inhibitor of <b>dihydrofolate</b> <b>reductase,</b> but whether this effect is sufficient to contribute to a mechanism of action or increases risk to the fetus during pregnancy is not known. Early studies of lamotrigine's mechanism of action examined its effects on the release of endogenous amino acids from rat cerebral cortex slices in vitro. As is the case for antiepileptic drugs that act on voltage-dependent sodium channels, lamotrigine inhibited the release of glutamate and aspartate evoked by the sodium-channel activator veratrine and was less effective in the inhibition of acetylcholine or GABA release. At high concentrations, it had no effect on spontaneous or potassium evoked amino acid release.|$|E
40|$|Sequencing of Mycoplasma gallisepticum genome {{fragment}} containing thymidylate synthase and ribonucleotide reductase gene clusters reveals {{both its}} unusual organization and gene content. Sequence analysis indicates {{the presence of}} a gene whose product can be considered as a fusion of two full size proteins: the N-terminal part shows significant similarity to mycoplasmal <b>dihydrofolate</b> <b>reductases,</b> while the C-terminal part of the polypeptide chain shows significant similarity to eukaryotic deoxycytidylate deaminase. Phylogenetic analysis has suggested that the C-terminal part of the M. gallisepticum fusion gene and eukaryotic deoxycytidylate deaminase genes are xenologous. No chromosomal regions encoding peptides similar to the C-terminal part of this fusion protein were found in completely sequenced genomes of Mycoplasma genitalium and Mycoplasma pneumoniae.

40|$|Mammalian <b>dihydrofolate</b> <b>reductases</b> (DHFR) {{catalyse}} {{the reduction}} of folate more efficiently than the equivalent bacterial enzymes, despite typically having similar efficiencies for {{the reduction of}} their natural substrate dihydrofolate. In contrast, we show here that DHFR from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima is able to catalyse reduction of folate to tetrahydrofolate with a similar efficiency to reduction of dihydrofolate under saturating conditions. NMR and mass spectrometry experiments showed no evidence for production of free dihydrofolate during either the EcDHFR- or TmDHFR-catalysed reductions of folate, suggesting that both enzymes perform the two reduction steps without release of the partially reduced substrate. Our results imply that the reaction proceeds more efficiently in TmDHFR than in EcDHFR because the more open active site of TmDHFR facilitates protonation of folate. Because T. maritima lives under extreme conditions where tetrahydrofolate is particularly prone to oxidation, this ability to salvage folate may impart an advantage to the bacterium by minimising wastage of a valuable cofactor...|$|R
40|$|This article {{introduces}} the computational procedure FamClash for analyzing incompatibilities in engineered protein hybrids by using protein family sequence data. All pairs of residue {{positions in the}} sequence alignment that conserve the property triplet of charge, volume, and hydrophobicity are first identified, and significant deviations are denoted as residue–residue clashes. This approach moves beyond earlier efforts aimed at solely classifying hybrids as functional or nonfunctional by correlating the rank ordering of these hybrids based on their activity levels. Experimental testing of this approach was performed in parallel to assess the predictive ability of FamClash. As a model system, single-crossover ITCHY (incremental truncation {{for the creation of}} hybrid enzymes) libraries were prepared from the Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis <b>dihydrofolate</b> <b>reductases,</b> and the activities of functional hybrids were determined.

25|$|The anti-folates include {{methotrexate}} and pemetrexed. Methotrexate inhibits <b>dihydrofolate</b> <b>reductase</b> (DHFR), {{an enzyme}} that regenerates tetrahydrofolate from dihydrofolate. When the enzyme is inhibited by methotrexate, the cellular levels of folate coenzymes diminish. These {{are required for}} thymidylate and purine production, which are both essential for DNA synthesis and cell division. Pemetrexed is another anti-metabolite that affects purine and pyrimidine production, and therefore also inhibits DNA synthesis. It primarily inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase, but also has effects on DHFR, aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase. The fluoropyrimidines include fluorouracil and capecitabine. Fluorouracil is a nucleobase analogue that is metabolised in cells to form at least two active products; 5-fluourouridine monophosphate (FUMP) and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-phosphate (fdUMP). FUMP becomes incorporated into RNA and fdUMP inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase; both of which lead to cell death. Capecitabine is a prodrug of 5-fluorouracil that is broken down in cells to produce the active drug. The deoxynucleoside analogues include cytarabine, gemcitabine, decitabine, azacitidine, fludarabine, nelarabine, cladribine, clofarabine, and pentostatin. The thiopurines include thioguanine and mercaptopurine.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, a Dr. Meadow {{encountered}} six {{babies with}} cleft lip and palate {{in addition to}} other congenital abnormalities whose mothers had been taking anticonvulsants. Meadow wrote a letter in The Lancet asking for cases of cleft lip and palate in babies whose mothers had taken anticonvulsants. That same year, Milunsky, Graef, and Gaynor reported cases of cleft lip and palate associated with attempted abortion with methotrexate and aminopterin, which are folic acid antagonists. While it was widely accepted by 1969 that these drugs could interfere with folic acid and that folic acid supplementation might have beneficial somatic effects, it was believed that folic acid supplementation could exacerbate seizures; this included the routine supplements given to pregnant women to prevent megaloblastic anemia. By 1970, the doctor had collected thirty-two cases. Sixteen of them were born to women taking primidone. 25% of the thirty-two cases had congenital heart defects; the reported rate in cleft lip and palate was 3-5%. Meadow emphasized that there was no proof of an association, the immense value of anticonvulsants and the probably small odds of any one epileptic woman having a child with a congenital abnormality. Roman and Caratzali reported in 1971 that the offspring of mice treated with primidone had more abnormal bone metaphases than controls; this was due to chromosomal lesions. By the mid-1970s, it was obvious that this antagonistic effect of primidone was not due to the inhibition of <b>dihydrofolate</b> <b>reductase,</b> the enzyme responsible for the reduction of dihydrofolic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid, but rather to defective folate metabolism.|$|E

Gut microbes are an epidemiologically important reservoir of resistance genes (resistome), yet prior {{studies indicate that}} the true diversity of gut-associated resistomes has been underestimated. To deeply characterize the pediatric gut-associated resistome, we created metagenomic recombinant libraries in an Escherichia coli host using fecal DNA from 22 healthy infants and children (most without recent antibiotic exposure), and performed functional selections for resistance to 18 antibiotics from eight drug classes. Resistance-conferring DNA fragments were sequenced (Illumina HiSeq 2000), and reads assembled and annotated with the PARFuMS computational pipeline. Resistance to 14 of the 18 antibiotics was found in stools of infants and children. Recovered genes included chloramphenicol acetyltransferases, drug-resistant <b>dihydrofolate</b> <b>reductases,</b> rRNA methyltransferases, transcrip-tional regulators, multidrug efflux pumps, and every major class of beta-lactamase, aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme, and tetracycline resistance protein.

Fifty-six isolates that were rifampicin-sensitive and belonged to Enterobacteriaceae family were chosen as donors for the conjugal transfer assay. Eighteen of the isolates successfully transferred conjugable plasmids to the E. coli DH 5 α recipient. Countable multiple antibiotic resistant transconjugants arose readily and conjugal transfer frequency was in the range of 3. 75 × 10 - 6 to 1. 0 × 10 - 1. The most common carriage of resistances conferred by transmissible R plasmids was against ampicillin, cefotaxim and cephalexin.

2500|$|Hybridomas are cells {{obtained}} by fusing tumor cells (which can divide infinitely) and immunoglobulin-producing lymphocytes (plasma cells). Hybridomas can {{be expanded to}} produce large quantities of immunoglobulins with a given unique specificity (monoclonal antibodies). One problem is to single out the hybridomas from the large excess of unfused cells after the cell fusion. One common way to solve this is to use thymidine kinase negative (TK−) tumor cell lines for the fusion. The thymidine kinase negative cells are {{obtained by}} growing the tumor cell line {{in the presence of}} thymidine analogs, that kill the thymidine kinase positive (TK+) cells. The negative cells can then be expanded and used for the fusion with TK+ plasma cells. After fusion, the cells are grown in a medium with methotrexate or aminopterin that inhibit the enzyme <b>dihydrofolate</b> <b>reductase</b> thus blocking the de novo synthesis of thymidine monophosphate. One such medium that is commonly used is HAT medium, which contains hypoxanthine, aminopterinand thymidine.

Neither is affected by methylmercuric salts but the wild type reductase is inactivated by phenyl-mercuric acetate and p-mercuribenzoate. Monovalent cations increase {{the activity of the}} mutant type reductase but decrease that of the wild type reductase. It is suggested that the amethopterin resistance in vivo of strain A depends at least partly on the folate reductase activity of the mutant type reductase...|$|R
