5|$|Most shipwrecks {{involved}} ships over 20 {{years in}} age. A glut of ships {{of this age}} occurred in the 1980s, caused by an overestimate {{of the growth of}} international trade.

5|$|Pre-Trial Chamber II {{ruled that}} there were {{reasonable}} <b>grounds</b> <b>to</b> be believe that William Ruto and Henry Kosgey were criminally responsible as indirect co-perpetrators of the crimes outlined in counts 1, 2 and 4, {{but in the case}} of Joshua Sang it ruled that his involvement was not essential to the commission of the crimes and so only ruled {{that there were}} <b>grounds</b> <b>to</b> believe he otherwise contributed to the crimes. The Chamber rejected the request by the Prosecutor to include the charge of torture in count 3. In the case of Kenyatta, Muthaura and Ali the Chamber ruled that there were reasonable <b>grounds</b> <b>to</b> believe that Uhuru Kenyatta and Francis Muthaura were guilty as indirect co-perpetrators of the crimes of which they were accused {{but in the case of}} Mohammed Ali, the Chamber ruled that his contribution was not essential to the commission of the crimes and so he was charged with having otherwise contributed.|$|E

5|$|A local architect, Thomas Fosbrooke, {{carried out}} the first archaeological {{investigation}} of the site in 1900, and extensive restoration work took place the following years. The Rawdon family were given a government grant for further repairs in 1912 {{and they began to}} start charging visitors for entry. The family found themselves unable to afford to maintain the castle, and by the early 1930s the walls had become unstable and dangerous. The castle was placed into the guardianship of the Ministry of Works in 1932, who carried out repairs, replacing some stonework and opening up the surrounding <b>grounds</b> <b>to</b> visitors.|$|E

Arctic engineers had raised concerns about the way plans for a subterranean pipeline showed ignorance of Arctic engineering and permafrost in particular. A clause in NEPA requiring a study of alternatives and another clause requiring an environmental impact statement turned those concerns into tools used by the Wilderness Society, Friends of the Earth, and the Environmental Defense Fund in their Spring 1970 lawsuit to stop the project.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge and Minnesota Territory's Henry Mower Rice {{were among}} the speculators who {{invested}} in land near present-day Superior, Wisconsin. Rice disliked Minnesota's territorial governor, Willis A. Gorman, and petitioned Pierce to replace him with Breckinridge. Pierce twice investigated Gorman, but found no <b>grounds</b> <b>to</b> remove him from office. Breckinridge fell ill when traveling to view his investments in mid-1855 {{and was unable to}} campaign in the state elections. Know Nothings captured every state office and six congressional districts—including the Eighth District—and Breckinridge sent regrets to friends in Washington, D.C., promising to take {{a more active role in}} the 1856 campaigns.|$|E
5|$|East Lawn {{was laid}} {{out in front of}} the east window and was used for grand bazaars and fêtes until the early 20th century. A ha-ha was {{installed}} behind to keep cattle out of the <b>grounds.</b> <b>To</b> the south of the priory buildings the Long Terrace ran almost the full length of the grounds. It afforded access to the ruins via a flight of steps flanked by two carved demi-sea wolves, reflecting the coat of arms of the Chaloners. They were thought to be dragons by local people and the steps were referred to as the Dragon Steps.|$|E

5|$|Henry's son, George Herbert, {{maintained}} the lease and his wife, Henrietta, constructed gravel-laid public {{walks around the}} castle, dug into the surrounding cliffs, and planted trees around the <b>grounds</b> <b>to</b> improve the castle's appearance. The castle walls and towers were given superficial repairs and tidied up, usually when parts threatened to collapse, and {{the interior of the}} inner bailey levelled, costing considerable sums of money. The landscape also required expensive maintenance and repairs.|$|E
5|$|In 1849, {{the club}} used a venue outside Brighton {{for the first}} time, when they played a {{first-class}} match at Petworth Park New Ground; the match against Surrey is notable for being one of Sussex's lowest aggregate scoring matches of all time, with only 287 runs scored. It was also {{the only time that}} Petworth Park hosted a Sussex match. Sussex have frequently used out <b>grounds</b> <b>to</b> host some of their matches, typically as part of cricket festivals. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, their main out grounds were the Central Recreation Ground in Hastings, The Saffrons in Eastbourne, the Cricket Field Road Ground in Horsham, and the Arundel Castle Cricket Ground (from 1972). After the Central Recreation Ground was demolished in 1996, Sussex also played two List A matches at Horntye Park, Hastings' other cricket ground. Eastbourne cancelled its proposed fixture in 2001 and did not host another county match until 2017, whilst Horsham was not awarded any matches for the 2016 season, due to financial difficulties. The County Ground and Arundel Castle are the only two <b>grounds</b> <b>to</b> have hosted Sussex Twenty20 matches, and were also the only two grounds which host Sussex matches in the 2016 season.|$|E

5|$|Being a scientist, {{above all}} else, Huxley {{presented}} agnosticism {{as a form}} of demarcation. A hypothesis with no supporting objective, testable evidence is not an objective, scientific claim. As such, there would be no way to test said hypotheses, leaving the results inconclusive. His agnosticism was not compatible with forming a belief as to the truth, or falsehood, of the claim at hand. Karl Popper would also describe himself as an agnostic. According to philosopher William L. Rowe, in this strict sense, agnosticism is the view that human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational <b>grounds</b> <b>to</b> justify either the belief that God exists or the belief that God does not exist.|$|E
5|$|Berkeley House on Piccadilly {{was named}} after John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton who had {{purchased}} its land, and that surrounding it, shortly after the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660. In 1696, the Berkeley family sold the house and <b>grounds</b> <b>to</b> the 1st Duke of Devonshire (who renamed it Devonshire House) on the proviso that {{the view from the}} rear of the house should not be spoiled. Berkeley Square was laid out to the rear of the house in the 1730s; because of the conditions of sale, houses were only built on the east and west sides of it. The west side still has various mid-18th century buildings along it, while the east side now contains offices including Berkeley Square House.|$|E
5|$|Continuous {{building}} and land acquisitions increased {{the size of}} the orphanage <b>grounds</b> <b>to</b> nearly 150 acres (600 dunam) by World War I. At the beginning of World War II, the British mandatory government deported the German teachers and turned the compound into a closed military camp with the largest ammunition stockpile in the Middle East. On March 17, 1948, the British abandoned the camp and the Etzioni Brigade of the Haganah used it as a base of operations during the 1948 Israeli War of Independence. For the next 60 years the site served as an Israeli army base known as Camp Schneller. The army vacated the premises in 2008. As of 2011, the compound is being developed for luxury housing.|$|E
