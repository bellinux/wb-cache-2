40|$|Background: Within {{the last}} decade, {{studies have shown}} body weight support {{treadmill}} training (BWSTT) to effectively improve neurologically impaired gait patterns in patients with spinal cord injury, stroke, Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease, and traumatic brain injury. To date, only three research studies on this intervention using subjects diagnosed with cerebral palsy (CP) have been published. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study}} was to further. investigate BWSTT effectiveness on the gait pattern and function of a child with CP Methods: A single subject design (ABA withdrawal) was conducted with an 11 year old male with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy. The intervention of BWSTT was performed twice a week for eight weeks. Gait parameters (velocity, cadence, stride length, single limb support time, degrees of toe in/out) were assessed using the GAITRite® gait mat. Function was assessed with the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI) and Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM). Energy expenditure of gait was determined using the Energy Expenditure Index (EEl). Data was analayzed using the two-standard deviation band method. Results: Statistically significant changes in degrees of toe in were demonstrated by the subject during the intervention phase while ambulating with and without solid AFOs. During the follow-up phase, significant changes during ambulation with AFOs were found in cadence, single support time, and degrees of toe in/out. Without AFOs, the subject 2 ̆ 7 s velocity, stride length, single support time, and degrees of toe in/out exhibited statistically significant changes. The subject showed improvement in his scores on both the GMFM and PEDI.

40|$|The low {{prolactin}} cell {{activity in}} seawater fish {{is related to}} the high calcium and mag nesium concentrations in seawater, not to its high osmolarity or high sodium content. After transfer of freshwater fish to seawater, prolactin cell activity was markedly reduced. A similar reduction occurred in freshwater fish after increasing the ionic calcium concentration to that of seawater. Magnesium ions, although considerably less effective than calcium in the same concentration, had a similar effect. In seawater fish prolactin cells were stimulated by reduction of the ambient calcium and magnesium concentrations. Data on blood plasma composition do not support the supposition that the effect of ambient calcium on prolactin secretion is mediated by changes in plasma osmolarity, plasma sodium, or plasma calcium levels. Prolactin is known to reduce the permeability of the fish integument for ions and water. Similar effects have been reported for ambient calcium and magnesium ions. The present results support the hypothesis that prolactin compensates for the effects of low ambient calcium and magnesium levels on water and ion permeability of the skin and gills, in hypotonic as well as hypertonic conditions.

This {{case report}} {{describes}} {{the use of}} gait re-education based on the Bobath concept to measure the changes {{that occurred in the}} gait of 2 patients with hemiplegia who were undergo-ing outpatient physical therapy. Case Description. One patient (“NM”), a 65 -year-old woman, was referred for physical therapy 6 weeks following a right cerebrovascular accident. She attended 30 therapy sessions over a 15 -week period. The other patient (“SA”), a 71 -year-old woman, was referred for physical therapy 7 weeks following a left cerebrovascular accident. She attended 28 therapy sessions over a 19 -week period. Clinical indexes of impairment and disability and 3 -dimensional gait data were obtained at the start of treatment and at discharge. Therapy was based on the Bobath concept. Outcomes. At discharge, NM demonstrated improvements in her hip and knee movements, reduced tone, and improved mobility. At discharge, SA demonstrated improved mobility. During gait, both patients demon-strated more normal movement patterns {{at the level of the}} pelvis, the knee, and the ankle in the sagittal plane. SA also demonstrated an improvement in hip extension. Discussion. These cases demonstrate that recovery of more normal movement patterns and functional ability can be achieved following a cardiovascular accident and provide insight into the clinical decision making of experienced practitioners using Bobath’s concept.

Purpose: The {{purpose of this study}} was to further investigate a relatively new type of therapeutic garment called TheraTogs™ and its effectiveness on the gait pattern and function of a child with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy. Methods: A single subject design (ABA withdrawal) was conducted with a 7 year old female with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy. The intervention of TheraTogs™ was worn for 6 consecutive hours everyday for 3 weeks.

40|$|Following human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) entry into the host cell, the viral capsid gradually disassembles in a process called uncoating. A proper rate of uncoating is important for reverse transcription of the HIV- 1 genome. Host restric-tion factors such as TRIM 5 and TRIMCyp bind retroviral capsids and cause premature disassembly, leading to blocks in re-verse transcription. Other host factors, such as cyclophilin A, stabilize the HIV- 1 capsid and are required for efficient infection in some cell types. Here, we show that a heat-labile factor greater than 100 kDa in the cytoplasm of cells frommultiple vertebrate species slows the spontaneous disassembly of HIV- 1 capsid-nucleocapsid (CA-NC) complexes in vitro. We identified the PDZ domain-containing protein 8 (PDZD 8) as {{a critical component of}} the capsid-stabilizing activity in the cytoplasmic extracts. PDZD 8 has been previously reported to bind the HIV- 1 Gag polyprotein and to make a positive contribution to the efficiency of HIV- 1 infection (M. <b>S.</b> <b>Henning,</b> <b>S.</b> G. Morham, S. P. Goff, andM. H. Naghavi, J. Virol. 84 : 8990 – 8995, 2010, doi: 10. 1128 / JVI. 00843 – 10). PDZD 8 knockdown accelerated the disassembly of HIV- 1 capsids in infected cells, resulting in decreased reverse transcription. The PDZD 8 coiled-coil domain is sufficient for HIV- 1 capsid binding, but other parts of the protein, including the PDZ domain, are apparently required for stabilizing the capsid and supporting HIV- 1 infection. In summary, PDZD 8 interacts with and stabilizes the HIV- 1 capsid and thus represents a potentially targetable host cofactor for HIV- 1 infection. IMPORTANC...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if the TUG Test is a valid predictor of future falls. Thirty older adults (ages 65 and above) completed a fall history questionnaire, asking how many falls they had experienced in the past five years. In addition, the TUG Test was conducted on each participant (11 males and 19 females). An independent-samples t-test found a significant difference in the scores for the group with zero falls (M= 8. 296250, SD=. 7755724) and group with one or two falls (M= 10. 544093, SD= 1. 5883778; t (- 5. 014 = p=. 000, two-tailed). The TUG Test shows to be a valid assessment tool in predicting future falls in the elderly.

40|$|Running and jogging (a slower, more rhythmic form of running) {{have become}} {{increasingly}} popular today. An unfortunate by-product of this broad interest in running has been the growing incidence of overuse injuries (the result of repetitive microtrauma to the tendons, bones and joints). The {{increase in the number}} of people who run in order to improve their physical fitness has been accompanied by an increase in the prevalence of musculoskeletal injuries due to running. Laboratory studies that analyzed an athlete <b>s</b> <b>gait</b> (pattern of walking or running) have determined that when running on level surfaces, the initial impact forces exerted on the lower extremities are two to three times the individual's body weight. This report aims to address the problem of running and jogging injuries by examining the forces exerted on the body and developing a foot attachment that would minimize the possibility of injury. These impact force peaks may be accompanied by high stresses on bones and joint surfaces. A major shock absorbing creation will allow these runners to continue to train and prepare when they might otherwise be injured by either preventing such injuries or by providing enough cushion to allow the runners to maintain training when injured. In this report a product was developed that would improve the wide world of sports. This product, comprised of a spring and damper system, was designed to address the detrimental consequences of the harsh impact force while restoring energy that is usually lost in impact. Preliminary testing has shown that this product has a high potential for successfully fulfilling this purpose.
