500|$|Many {{comparisons}} {{have been}} made on the song's style. Popjustice compared [...] "Better than Today" [...] to the style used in Minogue's 1990 album Rhythm of Love. Hannah Kim of the Korea JoongAng Daily stated the track adds on to a [...] "classic 70s disco sound". When reviewing the album, Ian Wade of BBC Music called the song a [...] "tech-country strut". Fraser McAlpine of BBC said that without research, it [...] "bears the musical fingerprint" [...] of Shears. [...] "It's got that 'Laura' bounce ... And the bit where Kylie <b>goes</b> <b>way</b> up high? Well you've heard the verses to 'I Don't Feel Like Dancin'' right? Sonically similar..." [...] Christel Loar of PopMatters and Nick Levine of Digital Spy praised the lyric in the song, [...] "What's the point in living if you don't wanna dance?" [...] Levine specifically applauded Pallot and Chatterly for [...] "coming up with probably the Kyliest Kylie lyric ever".|$|E
500|$|British {{newspapers}} The Guardian and The Times both {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} five stars. The Times James Bone said that it [...] "boasts the same sly cultural references and flashes of brilliance that have earned the television series a following that ranges from tots to comparative literature PhDs". The Guardians Peter Bradshaw stated that it [...] "gives you everything you could possibly want" [...] and that he thought, [...] "Eighty-five minutes [...] not long enough to do justice to 17 years of comedy genius". Ed Gonzalez praised the film for its political message, likening the Itchy & Scratchy cartoon at the beginning to President Schwarzenegger's situation later on, as well as the film's visual gags. Randy Shulman praised the cast, and described them as having [...] "elevated their vocal work to a craft that <b>goes</b> <b>way</b> beyond simple line readings", and particularly praised Kavner who he said [...] "gave what must be the most heartfelt performance ever". Roger Ebert gave a positive review, but admitted he was [...] "generally [...] a fan of movies spun off from TV animation". He called it [...] "radical and simple at the same time, subversive and good-hearted, offensive without really meaning to be". Richard Corliss of Time said that the film [...] "doesn't try to be ruder or kinkier, just bigger and better".|$|E
500|$|After the season, {{head coach}} Lloyd Carr was {{replaced}} by Rich Rodriguez. [...] Rodriguez' no huddle spread option offense, which used zone blocking, was a major adjustment for Boren. By the tenth day of spring practice Boren had left the team. Boren made {{a statement to the}} press regarding his decision, which included the following excerpt: [...] "Michigan football was a family, built on mutual respect and support for each other from (former) Coach (Lloyd) Carr on down. We knew it took the entire family, a team effort, and we all worked together[...] I have great trouble accepting that those family values have eroded in just a few months[...] [...]That I am unable to perform under these circumstances at the level I expect of myself, and my teammates and Michigan fans deserve, is why I have made the decision to leave." [...] A month later, Ohio State coach Jim Tressel announced Boren would redshirt for the 2008 NCAA Division I FBS football season and become the first player to transfer from Michigan to play for archrival Ohio State since at least World War II. [...] According to Section 14.5.2.B of the Rules of Eligibility in the Big Ten handbook, Boren is ineligible to be a scholarship athlete after transferring. [...] A little more than a week after Justin announced his transfer, his younger brother Zach committed to Ohio State. [...] Later that summer, Detroit Free Press writer Michael Rosenberg, backed up Boren's statement about family values: [...] "Rodriguez's staff uses some of the foulest, most degrading language imaginable. I know coaches curse, and I'm no prude, but this <b>goes</b> <b>way</b> beyond a few dirty words. He belittles his players. This {{is a big part of}} why offensive lineman Justin Boren [...] left the team. He felt his dignity was at stake." ...|$|E

500|$|Apple and NeXT {{marketing}} executive and Jobs' confidant in the film. When discussing her audition for the film, Winslet later commented that she [...] "heard about {{it through a}} crew member who I happened {{to be working with}} , I didn't even care what role it was. I just wanted to be in it. Found out the nature of the role. Googled [...] Found one picture of her. Got my husband to go to a wig shop. Buy a short-haired dark wig. Stuck it on my head. Sent a photograph of myself to [...] Scott Rudin. Danny Boyle came to Melbourne and we had a meeting and he gave me the part." [...] Winslet spent considerable time with Joanna Hoffman to prepare for the role before production began. She noted that Hoffman [...] "has a softness to her. She came to America as a young woman and achieved a great deal. One thing that was unique about her as a figure in Steve's life was that she didn't need anything from him. She just needed for him to be the best version of himself. And that's what really set their relationship apart from any relationship with all his other colleagues." [...] Winslet credits Hoffman's difficult childhood (that began in Armenia) with her ability to manage Jobs. [...] On {{the nature of the relationship}} between Hoffman and Jobs, Winslet said that she and Fassbender [...] "were able to develop as literally co-workers. I do believe it was very similar to the relationship that Steve and Joanna had. She was like his work wife. She was head of marketing for the Macintosh, and then she stayed with him for his working life. She was an extraordinary, feisty Eastern European person who was pretty much the only person who could actually knock sense into Steve, and she was also kind of an emotional compass." [...] In developing her sense of the character, Winslet stated that she [...] "just wanted to please [...] as much as I could. How she sounds, and her accent, is fairly complicated. She grew up largely in Armenia, spent some time in Poland, and has Russians in her family, so she has all three accents, but she's been in America since she was a teenager, so she had American rhythms. You know, she really has this accent that <b>goes</b> <b>way</b> up and down. It's almost impossible to copy because of just how singsongy it becomes. So I had to put it into my own register. But we were all doing accents. I mean, Michael's Irish, and he's playing Steve Jobs, for God's sake." [...] Finally, Winslet notes that Hoffman [...] "did genuinely love [...] And spending time with her, when I was figuring out how to play this difficult part, she would become very emotional. She misses him terribly." ...|$|E
