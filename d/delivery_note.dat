50|$|Often {{when two}} {{companies}} deal {{with each other}} in the course of business, they will use standard form contracts. Often these standard forms contain terms which conflict (e.g. both parties include a liability waiver in their form). The 'battle of the forms' refers to the resulting legal dispute arising where both parties accept that a legally binding contract exists, but disagree about whose standard terms apply. Such disputes may be resolved by reference to the 'last document rule', i.e. whichever business sent the last document, or 'fired the last shot' (often the seller's <b>delivery</b> <b>note)</b> is held to have issued the final offer and the buyer's organisation is held to have accepted the offer by signing the <b>delivery</b> <b>note</b> or simply accepting and using the delivered goods.|$|E

TIRTA INVESTAMA DISTRIBUTION CENTER SOLO” Final Project: Undergraduate Program of Administrative Management of Social and Political Sciences Faculty of Sebelas Maret University. Invoice is the {{evidence}} of product or service sale generally used by those selling product. The invoice preparation plays {{a very important part}} in supporting the office activity because the printed invoice can serve as evidence of product releasing, product delivery evidence, as {{the evidence}} of collection, as the evidence of archive when some time an inspection is conducted and as the evidence of product return. To get a good invoice preparation, a good procedure is required as well. With the good procedure, the invoice preparation process could be implemented well. This final project aimed to describe and to explain the procedure of invoice preparation as the means of collecting receivable accounts in PT. Tirta Investama Distribution Center Solo. This observation was conducted using descriptive qualitative type of observation, the one describing or depicting the procedure of invoice preparation in the form of sentences and based on the facts. The data source derived from information, event or activity. Techniques of collecting data used were direct observation, interview. The result of observation conducted in Finance division of PT. Tirta Investama, the writer explained that the invoice preparation procedure included DN (<b>Delivery</b> <b>Note</b> collection) from Driver, <b>Delivery</b> <b>Note</b> checking by Distribution Administrator, matching the collection document, invoice printing process by Invoicing administrator. Invoicing administrator conducted Billing process, the billing document was transferred from Invoicing Administrator to Collection Administrator. When the procedure was conducted well, the invoice preparation process would run well and no obstruction. From the result of research, the writer concluded that the procedure of invoice preparation had run well and conducted in good cooperation by the corresponding employees. However, there were still obstructions in the term of delayed DN (<b>Delivery</b> <b>Note)</b> submission to Invoicing Administrator due to unprinted BTB (Product Receiving Evidence) thereby leading to inhibited invoice preparing process.

40|$|The current {{methods of}} {{processing}} orders, deliveries and invoices of concrete {{products in the}} construction industry is enormously inefficient, with vast quantities of paperwork, duplication of effort, scanning, re-keying and resolving mismatches between purchase orders, delivery dockets and invoices. This paper sets out results of a survey which reveals attitudes to Information Communication Technologies (ICT) in supporting the purchasing process in construction. The drivers and barriers to ICT use in construction purchasing is discussed from both the contractor‟s and supplier‟s perspective. The paper goes on to describe the outcome of a pilot study in which the efficiencies are investigated arising from using available technology to provide proof of delivery. The response of site personnel in using this technology is discussed, together with lessons learned in the pilot study. Arising from the survey and pilot study results, a proposal is made to re-engineer the procurement process, taking into account the available technologies. The re-engineered solution seeks to achieve an integrated three-way electronic match of the purchase order, <b>delivery</b> <b>note</b> and supplier invoice.

40|$|Background and Purpose: Need for distilling wood {{is rather}} {{significant}} {{on the wood}} market in Republic of Srpska. Delivering of distilling wood is done according JUS standard. Purpose {{of this research was}} to explore how much this standard is appropriate for present assortment of wood which deliver and use as distilling wood, and what are main problems. Material and Methods: Research was conducted at the premises of the company “Destilacija” a. d. Teslic. It was selected samples of distillation wood in a random manner, so as to check accuracy of conversion factors stated in the <b>delivery</b> <b>note.</b> Subject of interest were loads with one-meter log wood for distillation. Conversion coefficients are determined by using xylometry method and dendrometric method. Results and Conclusion: Conversion factor based on xylometry varies considerably between 0. 45 – 0. 58. Results lead to the conclusion that appliance of officially prescribed conversion factor leads to over estimation of delivered distillation wood. Also results of dendrometric measurements and calculating of volume show that conversions factors are significantly lower than those one obtain with the xylometry 0. 36 - 0. 52. Main reason for that may laying in the fact that measurements was done according to JUS which prescribes measurement with rounding down for diameter (round centimeters) and length (round decimeters). Dendrometric measurement according JUS is not appropriate for assortments from the category of staked wood. Conversion coefficients must be determined for different moisture content. One solution for described gap may be shift to weight scaling. In that case mistakes caused by measurement could be avoided but it must be considered moisture of wood also. Wood for distilling should be as dry as much as possible before use, around 20...|$|E
