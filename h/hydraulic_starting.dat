5000|$|In 1967 Hydranautics, now Bardex Corporation, designed, patented, {{manufactured}} {{and delivered}} the first shiplift using chain instead of wire rope. These Shiplifts differ distinctly {{in the use}} of hydraulic Chain Jacks and Stud Link Anchor Chain to lift commercial ships, naval vessels and submarines. [...] The five distinct advantages to the Bardex Chain Jack Shiplift are: 1) Chain is inherently less susceptible to corrosion and bending fatigue as any chain corrosion is visible on the outside surfaces as opposed to wire rope. For this reason, Lloyd’s shipping register requires 20% of wire ropes to be removed and destructively tested each year with all wire ropes to be replaced every 5-10 years. Lloyd’s does not stipulate any specific duty life limitations for chains which have been known to last for over 20 years in operation.2) Traditional wire rope shiplift systems rely on synchronous motors powering the winches. These motors cause a large power demand on the system when <b>started.</b> <b>Hydraulic</b> systems <b>start</b> at no load so there is no excessive inrush current demand.3) The use of dual chains for redundancy in lieu of a single wire rope at each hoist provides extra safety and reliability.4) Use of chain allows incremental mechanical synchronization of the entire lift operation. The chain links are made to very tight fabrication tolerances so that after each jacking stroke, the platform is set down on the next set of chain links and the level has been “reset”. Wire rope hoist by comparison can become cumulatively unsynchronized over the duration of a lift requiring the operation to stop and be adjusted.4) At all times the shiplift and the vessel are mechanically held by chain resting on support pins not relying on a braking system. 5) Holding the rigid shiplift platform at the correct elevation for Transfer Operations is a locked mechanical function as the chain is pinned in position without the deflection inherent in wire rope systems. A Bardex Shiplift has never dropped a vessel.|$|R

The calculation of the sensitivity coefficients takes into account the cases in which the parameters under consideration influence the initial condition. For these cases, the calculation can be performed by solving sequentially two perturbative problems: the first one is non-steady, while the second one is steady, with an appropriate selection of a weight function coming from the unsteady perturbative problem. As an example, a constant-level tank connected through a pipe to a valve discharging to atmosphere was considered. The corresponding sensitivity coefficients due to the variation of different parameters by using both the differential method and the response surface generated by solver of the direct problem, were also calculated.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to bring a scientific contribute in the problem of reducing diesel in-cylinder emissions, and releasing the diesel engine from its dependence on petroleum. The first two introductory chapters of this dissertation contain an overview of these two issues and the techniques used nowadays to address them respectively. In this context, the emphasis is on the injection system parameters and the most interesting petroleum-diesel alternatives. Improvements of the injection system parameters help to meet future more stringent exhaust gas limits and seem to become the decisive factor to reach further emission targets. The search for alternatives to petroleum-based fuels is probably the only solution which, at the same time, may help to reduce the harmful exhaust emissions and to diversify energy sources, thus improving security of supply. The first part of this work was dedicated to the design and implementation of a test bench for investigating the hydraulic injection behaviour of large diesel injectors (up to 1000 mg per stroke). This task was motivated by the need to develop the diagnostics for a new experimental 4 -litres, single cylinder diesel engine. The test bench consists of an injection rate measuring system of the Bosch tube type that is able to completely define all injector characteristics as: Injection time (<b>hydraulic</b> <b>start,</b> end and corresponding delay from electric signal), injection rate and injected quantity. In the third chapter of this dissertation, first a brief overview is given of the state of the art of the injection system technology and of the physical measurement principle of the injection analyzer. Then, the design of the new injection meter is described. The implementation of the measurement setup with the data acquisition system and the development and implementation of the data processing algorithm are also presented. Some measurement results are shown to demonstrate the performances of the new injection analyzer. The second part of this work aimed at contributing to a research project named “Future Fuels for Diesel Engines” and promoted by the FVV (Research Association for Combustion Engines), with partners the LAV and the Institute for Internal Combustion Engines and Automotive Engineering (Institut für Verbrennungsmotoren und Kraftfahrwesen, IVK). This project aimed on clarifying the influences of chemical and physical properties of synthetic fuels on combustion and emission behaviour at conventional diesel engine operation in order to define the basis for premium synthetic fuels. Therefore seven synthetic blends of components with different chemical structures and with a common matrix obtained by the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process, were defined and investigated. Results were then compared to a reference diesel fuel following the requirements of EN 590. In last chapter of this dissertation an overview of the entire project is given. The main topic is, however, the investigation of these fuels’ behaviour with regard to injection through a commercial diesel injector. A study to identify dependencies of the injection rate profile on the fuel’s physical properties was conducted comparing the injection rate profiles obtained with the different fuels. This research was conducted using an injection test bench featuring a commercially available injection analyzer.

40|$|The {{hydraulic}} gold-mining process {{used during}} the California Gold Rush and {{in many developing countries}} today contributes enormous amounts of sediment to rivers and streams. Commonly, accompanying this sediment are contaminants such as elemental mercury and cyanide used in the gold extraction process. We show that some of the mercury-contaminated sediment created by hydraulic gold mining in the Sierra Nevada, between 1852 and 1884, ended up over 250 kilometers (km) away in San Francisco Bay; an example of the far-reaching extent of contamination from such activities. A combination of radionuclide dating, bathymetric reconstruction, and geochemical tracers were used to distinguish the hydraulic mining sediment from sediment deposited in the bay before <b>hydraulic</b> mining <b>started</b> (pre-Gold Rush sediment) and sediment deposited after hydraulic mining stopped (modern sediment). Three San Francisco Bay cores were studied as well as source material from the abandoned hydraulic gold mines and river sediment between the mines and bay. Isotopic and geochemical compositions of the core sediments show a geochemical shift in sediment deposited during the time of hydraulic mining. The geochemical shift is characterized by a decrease in εNd, total organic carbon (TOC), Sr and Ca concentrations, Ca/Sr, and Ni/Zr; and, an increase in 87 Sr/ 86 Sr, Al/Ca, Hg concentrations, and quartz/plagioclase. This shift is {{in the direction of the}} geochemical signature of sediments from rivers and gold mines in hydraulic mining areas. Mixing calculations using Nd isotopes and concentrations estimate that the hydraulic mining debris comprises up to 56 % of the sediment in core sediments deposited during the time of hydraulic mining.

About 60 %– 80 % of all oil and gas wells in the U. S. will require fracturing treatment to remain viable, so finding new methods to make hydraulic fracturing sustainable while maintaining environmental integrity {{should be at the}} forefront of the debate. However, hydraulic fracturing is an extremely controversial topic and most voters do not fully understand all the issues. Hydraulic fracturing will remain a necessary “evil” in order to fulfill the world’s growing energy demand, because hydraulic fracturing extracts natural gas. Until the next green innovation, natural gas will be the bridge fuel to the future. Natural gas is clean, abundant, domestic, versatile, secure and valuable, which makes natural gas the most environmentally friendly hydrocarbon today. Hydraulic fracturing or “fracing” blast sand, chemicals and water at high pressures to extract oil and natural gas found deep below in the earth’s shale formations. Fracing allegedly is associated with four major environmental concerns: water contamination, methane leaks, water usage and seismic activity. This paper examines both sides of the arguments including both the critics’ and proponents’ perspectives. Each environmental concern examines the extent of the environmental issues and explains the common misconceptions associated with fracing. New technologies and policies will offer oil and gas companies alternatives to make fracing safer. Wastewater recycling, new fracing fluids and better regulations are to name just a few. Though, the public’s demand for more renewable resources is a noble cause and still should be an option on the table. However, understanding why non-dispatchable technologies like wind and solar cannot replace natural gas in the immediate future is an important argument to understand why the world currently needs fracing. Current political trends indicate that fracing is here to stay, but companies should expect more rules and regulations to follow. However, just because the world needs fracing does not mean hydraulic fracturing cannot be done ethically and sustainably. FracFocus and the Center for Sustainable Shale Development provide companies with self-regulations that will make fracing more sustainable and environmentally safe. Self-regulation is just one example of how oil and gas companies may conduct fracing ethically while gaining a competitive advantage by staying ahead of costly regulations. Fracing may be here to stay, but there are methods to conduct fracing ethically while still being profitable for oil and gas companies...|$|R

By now, in many places of the delta hydraulic works such as additional canals, dykes and sluices have been set up, constructed for regulating water flows. Technical innovations in hydraulic management and agricultural production have not only had significant impact on the delta’s environment and ecology, but also have triggered social transformation, in particular the appearance of new social groups struggling for access to resources and power. This paper intends to analyzes recent trends of social development and water management in the Mekong Delta from a scientific approach that is based on two social theories, firstly “strategic group analysis”, and secondly selected core aspects of Wittfogel’s social theory of “hydraulic society”. By presenting recently collected data, it is illustrated how the Mekong Delta has been transformed into a modern hydraulic society, in which certain strategic groups emerged as a consequence of growing activities in hydraulic management and agricultural-based economic growth. More specifically, the paper aims to give an overview of strategic group development in the delta by putting a strong focus on the process of forming a state bureaucracy of hydraulic management and the appearance of hydraulic construction companies as its clients. The paper shows how the strategic alliance between both groups has increased the chances for mutually appropriating government funds spent on hydraulic works and how this has caused ecologically and socially far-reaching impacts for the Mekong Delta. ...|$|R
40|$|The Nyegga area {{is located}} at the {{north-eastern}} escarpment of the large Storegga Slide on the south of the Vøring plateau. The region has long been a natural laboratory for shallow fluid flow investigations, mainly due to the large number of fluid flow expressions found on the bathymetric and seismic data, and the possibility to investigate the relationship between fluid flow, gas hydrate formation and slope stability. The seafloor at Nyegga is marked by hundreds of small depressions and mounds. These are in turn the upper termination of semi-circular zones of low amplitude, upbended or downbended reflections called acoustic chimneys or pipes. These chimneys terminate also at different stratigraphic horizons below the seafloor and have been interpreted as episodic fluid flow expulsion features. Underlying Eocene-Oligocene polygonal fault systems are suspected of being a long term source of fluids to the shallow subsurface sediments, while Tertiary domes are suspected to be possible leakage areas for thermogenic fluids. The area is characterized by the presence of free gas trapped beneath a seal of gas hydrates as indicated by a bottom simulating reflector (BSR). In this study 287 pockmarks, 23 mounds and 441 acoustic chimneys were investigated using high resolution swath bathymetry and 3 D seismic data. The data allowed mapping and quantification of several parameters of seabed and subseabed expressions of fluid flow. The results showed that the pockmarks and mounds at Nyegga are not directly related to the polygonal fault system, but instead are product of blowout events originating from two locally overpressured shallow reservoirs overlying the polygonal fault system. Indications of fluid migration starting {{from the base of the}} polygonal faults system were found, but these fluids are most likely being distributed by the shallow reservoirs. The blowout events are the result of <b>hydraulic</b> fracturing <b>starting</b> mainly from structural crests or updip pinchouts within free gas-accumulation zones beneath the base of the gas hydrate stability zone or from traps beneath glacigenic debris flow deposits. Quantification of the pockmarks, mounds and acoustic chimneys showed that the largest pockmarks and mounds are found overlying structural closures and traps with presumably highest overpressure within the free gas zones, indicating a relationship between their size and the degree of overpressure. Pockmarks, mounds and acoustic chimneys are mainly elongated features and in some areas their orientation was found to be parallel to the free gas trapping structures in the subsurface. This is an indication that the orientation of pockmarks and mounds in these areas is inherited from the acoustic chimneys and hence from the axis of hydraulic fracturing.

40|$|The SIC {{software}} (Simulation of Irrigation Canals) {{is one of}} {{the latest}} hydraulic models developed by Cemagref. The first developments on <b>hydraulic</b> numerical modeling <b>started</b> at Cemagref in the early 1970 's. Lots of improved and updated versions have been made since this period. Right now, several hydraulic models exist at Cemagref, {{depending on the type of}} systems and events to simulate (rivers, irrigation canals, dam break, drainage systems, etc.). One of these models has been particularly dedicated to irrigation canals. This model, called SIC, has been adapted from another hydraulic model, where some features have been removed, new ones have been introduced, and for which special user-friendly interfaces have been developed. It was also adapted to run on currently available IBM PC computers or compatibles. It can be used both by engineers and by canal managers. The very first version of this model has been developed for the I. I. M. I. (International Irrigation Management Institute) on a real canal located in the south coast of Sri Lanka (Kirindi Oya Right Bank Main Canal). One purpose of this model was to be easily usable by canal managers as a decision support tool, in order to help them in the daily operation and maintenance of their system. Since this first application was promising, Cemagref, with other partners, decided to develop a new standard version of this software, that could be used on most of the irrigation canals world-wide. A study Advisory Committee has been set up to decide the required features of the model, and follow its development. This Committee led to the SIC User's Club with representatives of the different partners: BCEOM, CACG, Cemagref, CNABRL, ENGREF, IIMI, LAAS, LHF, MAE, MRE, MCoop., OIE, SCP and SOGREAH (Cf. Annex 1 for acronyms). One main purpose of this Club was also to foster communication among model developers and users. It allows to share experiences, new developments, needs of improvements, etc. / Le Cemagref a développé un logiciel de simulation hydraulique des canaux (SIC) qu'il utilise pour ses besoins de recherche et qu'il commercialise. Ce logiciel permet de modéliser pratiquement n'importe quel canal d'irrigation, d'en étudier son comportement hydraulique, d'en déduire des paramètres hydrauliques importants pour sa commande automatique, de tester diverses modifications de ses structures (conception, réhabilitation) et différents algorithmes de régulation automatique. Une fois que les algorithmes ont été mis au point, et testés avec succès sur logiciel de simulation, ils peuvent êtres implantés sur site...|$|R
40|$|The dam of Mosul on the Tigris {{river in}} {{northern}} Iraq {{is the largest}} in the country and holds around 11 km 3 of water. Built on water permeable rock, the inherent instability of the Mosul dam has been known since it was built and this was mitigated by continuous grouting. In recent years adequate maintenance has not taken place, leading to concerns about the safety of the dam. In 2003 the government decided to lower the maximum water level from 330 to 319 metres. During the recent conflict, maintenance has again been disrupted and signs at the dam have triggered renewed concerns, highlighted in the Schnabel report. As a result, the government of Iraq have contracted the Italian engineering company Trevi to undertake remedial work on the dam. This work is scheduled to start later in the Spring of 2016. In late February 2016 the Iraqi government advised the residents of Mosul to move at least 5 km away from the river in case of breach. A UN mission of UNDAC experts left for Iraq in early April to assess the situation, supported by an associated expert from the European Union Civil Protection Mechanism. A number of studies have been devoted to the possible effects of a failure of the dam. In this study we perform a number of medium-resolution (180 m) dynamic <b>hydraulic</b> simulations <b>starting</b> from various constant percentages of destruction of the dam and allowing the corresponding quantity of water (supposing the lake to be at its highest level) to flow downslope for periods of 6 and 12 days. Compared to previous studies we provide in addition a complete timescale of the water flow progression, detailed maps of the water depth and extent in the affected cities’ areas and focus more on the numbers of population affected by various water depths. The main scenario analysed in this study, where the dam is 26 % destroyed, the level of the lake is at its maximum value of 330 m, and most of the lake’s water is allowed to flow out fast, results in a very high wave of water (in places 25 m high, mean height around 12 m) arriving at Mosul city after 1 h 40 min. The capital Baghdad is reached after about 3. 5 days with a max water height of 8 m and a mean of around 2 m. The simulations suggest that in the above scenario a total of more than 6 million people (close to one sixth of the country’s population) will be affected by floodwaters, with two million of them facing water of more than 2 m. Water heights of more than 10 m would inundate an area with 270 000 people, most of them in Mosul city and its surroundings, whose lives, houses and infrastructure would risk complete destruction. A number of other scenarios involving lower initial levels of the lake are also analysed, considering levels of 319 m (the current one), and 315, 309, 307, 305 and 300 m. Significant reductions in the affected populations and later arrival times are seen for lower initial lake levels. The differences are quite prominent in Mosul as well as in Baghdad, where we also provide detailed maps of the inundation in the various cases. The scenario of part of the flood wave being diverted to lake Tharthar by an existing channel near Samarra is also examined in detail. These results are a first-order approximation, favouring speed of calculation over detail for a rapid assessment; it is planned to refine them later using higher resolution ground elevation data (that take much longer to run) and more detailed, time-dependent scenarios of dam failure.
