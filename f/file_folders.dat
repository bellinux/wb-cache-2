25|$|A {{filing cabinet}} {{is a piece}} of office {{furniture}} usually used to store paper documents in <b>file</b> <b>folders.</b> In the most simple sense, it is an enclosure for drawers in which items are stored. A vertical file cabinet has drawers that extend from the short side (typically 15inches) of the cabinet. The vertical filing cabinet was invented by Edwin G. Seibels in 1898, thus revolutionizing efficient record-keeping and archiving by creating space for offices, schools, and businesses.|$|E

25|$|There was no {{immediate}} search and seizure {{as a result of}} the first program. Although five cases were heard by two judges at that point, any judge could have secured potential evidence without waiting for the combining of the cases. Opposition parties criticized the lack of immediate action, attributing it to government-appointed chief of prosecutors Alejandra Gils Carbó. Several neighbours reported on April 17 that documentation was removed from the Madero Center (the alleged location of La Rosadita) over a several-hour period; a search and seizure was conducted the following day. Casanello requisitioned security-camera tapes to ascertain if documents were removed before the operation, and the investigation suggested that information may have been erased from computers between the first program and the search-and-seizure operation. It was discovered that Austral Construcciones (owned by Lázaro Báez and operating with large sums of money) was a client of La Rosadita and its telephones had Báez on speed dial. The son of Daniel Pérez Gadín (Báez's accountant) was identified in the security tapes as one of the men removing papers, boxes and <b>file</b> <b>folders</b> before the search and seizure; Casanello opened a separate investigation.|$|E

2500|$|A {{filing cabinet}} {{is a piece}} of office {{furniture}} used to store paper documents in <b>file</b> <b>folders.</b> It is an enclosure for drawers in which items are stored.

2500|$|Leet {{originated}} within {{bulletin board}} systems (BBS) in the 1980s, where having [...] "elite" [...] status on a BBS allowed a user access to <b>file</b> <b>folders,</b> games, and special chat rooms. [...] The Cult of the Dead Cow hacker collective has {{been credited with}} the original coining of the term, in their text-files of that era. [...] One theory {{is that it was}} developed to defeat text filters created by BBS or Internet Relay Chat system operators for message boards to discourage the discussion of forbidden topics, like cracking and hacking. Creative misspellings and ASCII-art-derived words were also a way to attempt to indicate one was knowledgeable about the culture of computer users. Once the reserve of hackers, crackers, and script kiddies, leet has since entered the mainstream. It is now also used to mock newbies, or newcomers, on web sites, or in gaming communities. Some consider emoticons and ASCII art, like smiley faces, to be leet, while others maintain that leet consists of only symbolic word encryption. More obscure forms of leet, involving the use of symbol combinations and almost no letters or numbers, continue to be used for its original purpose of encrypted communication. It is also sometimes used as a script language. Variants of leet have been used for censorship purposes for many years; for instance [...] "@$$" [...] (ass) and [...] "$#!+" [...] (shit) are frequently seen to make a word appear censored to the untrained eye but obvious to a person familiar with leet.|$|E
