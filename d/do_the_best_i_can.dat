[...] Wearing a white bandana in his hat {{to notify}} the Texians {{that he was one}} of them, he spurred his horse and rode, unmolested, through the Alamo gate as the ring of Mexican {{soldiers}} looked on in surprise. [...] Bonham's news, that Fannin was not coming after all, reportedly demoralized the Alamo garrison. [...] Travis sent a courier that evening to the Convention with news that the Texians had thus far survived the siege with no losses. [...] He warned, however, that: [...] "I look to the colonies alone for aid; unless it arrives soon, I shall have to fight the enemy on his own terms. I will, however, <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> under the circumstances, and I feel confident that the determined valour and desperate courage, heretofore evinced by my men, will not fail them in the last struggle, and although they may be sacrificed to the vengeance of a Gothic enemy, the victory will cost the enemy so dear, that it will be worse for him than a defeat." [...] Travis ended his letter with news that despite the dearth of ammunition, his men would fire the 18-lb cannon three times each day as proof that they still held the fort. [...] Travis then wrote several private letters and entrusted all of the communications to John W. Smith, who volunteered to sneak through the enemy lines.|$|E

On 17 February 1540 Lady Rutland wrote more positively to Lady Lisle: [...] "My very good lady...And where ye be very desirous to have your daughter Mistress Basset {{to be one of the}} Queen's Grace's maids, and that ye would I should move her Grace in that behalf. These shall be to do your ladyship: to wit that I perceive right well the King's Highness' pleasure to be such that no more maids shall be taken in until such time as some of them that now be with the Queen's Grace be preferred. Albeit if ye will make some means unto Mother Lowe, who can do as much good in this matter as any one woman here, that she may make some means to get your said daughter with the Queen's said Grace; and in so doing I think ye shall obtain your purpose in every behalf and I for my part shall <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> to prefer her here for I would be right glad thereof both for the great honesty that is in her".|$|E
