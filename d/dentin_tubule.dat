5000|$|Self {{assembling}} {{properties of}} P11-4 {{are used to}} regenerate early caries lesions. By application of P11-4 on the tooth surface, the peptide diffuse through the intact hypomineralized plate into the early caries lesion body and start, due to the low pH in such a lesion, to self-assemble generating a peptide scaffold mimicking the enamel matrix. Around the newly formed matrix de-novo enamel-crystals are formed from calcium phosphate present in saliva. Through the remineralization caries activity is significantly reduced in comparison with a fluoride treatment alone. In aqueous oral care gels the peptide is present as matrix. It binds directly as matrix to the tooth mineral and forms a stable layer on the teeth. This layer does protect the teeth from acid attacks.

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of diode laser irradiation and bleaching materials on the dentinal tubule diameter after laser bleaching. Material and Methods: The dentin discs of 40 extracted third molar were used in this experiment. Each disc surface was divided into two halves by grooving. Half of samples were laser bleached at different wavelengths with two different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. Other half of each disc with no laser bleaching remained as a negative control. Dentin discs were assigned randomly into four groups (n= 10) with following hydrogen peroxide and diode laser wavelength specifications; Group 1 (30 % - 810 nm), group 2 (30 % - 980 nm), group 3 (46 % - 810 nm) and group 4 (46 % - 980 nm). All specimens were sent for scanning electron microscopic (SEM) analysis in order to measure tubular diameter in laser treated and control halves. Data were analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey test (p< 0. 05). Results: A significant reduction in <b>dentin</b> <b>tubule</b> diameter was observed in groups 1, 2 and 4.

30|$|The bond {{strength}} between the resin luting agent and post-space dentin {{is influenced by}} the distribution of resin cement in the coronal, middle, and apical third of the root during the luting procedure and by the anatomic and histologic characteristics of the root canal, including the orientation of <b>dentin</b> <b>tubule</b> [114 – 117].

40|$|ABSTRACT—In this paper, {{the fatigue}} and {{fracture}} proper-ties of bovine dentin are evaluated using in vitro experimen-tal analyses. Double cantilever beam (DCB) specimens were prepared from bovine maxillary molars {{and subjected to}} zero-to-tension cyclic loads. The fatigue crack growth rate was eval-uated {{as a function of}} the <b>dentin</b> <b>tubule</b> orientation using the Paris law. Wedge-loaded DCB specimens were also prepared and subjected to monotonic opening loads. Moiré interferom-etry was used to acquire the in-plane displacement field dur-ing stable crack growth, and the instantaneous wedge load and crack length were acquired to evaluate the crack growth resistance and crack tip opening displacement (CTOD) with crack extension. The rate of fatigue crack growth was gen-erally larger for crack propagation occurring perpendicular to the dentin tubules. The Moiré fringe fields documented during monotonic crack growth exhibited non-linear deformation oc-curring within a confined region adjacent to the crack tip. Both the wedge load and CTOD response provided evidence that a fracture process zone contributes to energy dissipation dur-ing crack extension and that dentin exhibits a rising R-curve behavior. Results from this preliminary investigation are being used as a guide for an evaluation of the fatigue and fracture properties of human dentin.

The {{aim of this study}} was to quantify the particle size and shape of commercial-grade UltraCal XS (UC) and to compare it with that of research-grade Ca(OH) 2 (RG) using a flow particle image analyzer (FPIA). The morphology and penetration inside the <b>dentin</b> <b>tubules</b> of the UC and RG particles were examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM).

In addition, UC paste and RG aqueous slurry were agitated on dentin discs and were prepared for SEM examination. There were significant differences between UC and RG with regard to the frequency of different length groups (P < 0. 0001). UC contained smaller particles than RG (P < 0. 0001).

40|$|The {{anisotropic}} composite {{nature of}} human teeth guarantees their function for decades under high mechanical loads and adverse chemical conditions. Even more so since only marginal remodelling and repair mechanisms take place in adult teeth. While the macroscopical anatomy of the tooth has been well understood, long range ordering of the tooth’s micro and nano components is still matter of research. Tooth micro- and nanostructure has been extensively studied, mainly with two-dimensional approaches as, for example, electron microscopy. The ultrastructural organization over a whole tooth is, however, not readily accessible with these approaches, because they only permit a very localized observation and often even remove the investigated structures from their natural three-dimensional organization. The high degree of anisotropy in both dentin and enamel on the micro- and nanometer scale has a strong impact on the tooth’s mechanical properties. For example, the Young’s modulus and crack resistance of dentin are different parallel and perpendicular to the <b>dentin</b> <b>tubules.</b> Synchrotron radiation-based micro computed tomography with pixel sizes in the sub-micrometer range allows to three-dimensionally image <b>dentin</b> <b>tubules,</b> however only over restricted specimen sizes below one millimetre in diameter. To map the tubular network over an entire tooth, multiple scans are necessary. Given the generally limited beamtime available at synchrotron sources, a method has to be identified that allows for the visualization of <b>dentin</b> <b>tubules</b> with high accuracy and within reasonable time.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyze the effects of toothbrushing with desensitizing toothpastes on dentin permeability and dentinal tubule occlusion. Fifty rats provided two hundred incisor teeth divided into five groups: DW, brushed with distilled water (control); FT, brushed with fluoride toothpaste; SCT, brushed with strontium chloride toothpaste; PCT, brushed with potassium citrate toothpaste; and PNT, brushed with potassium nitrate toothpaste. Cavities were prepared to expose the dentinal tubules, and the incisor teeth were brushed using the experimental agents. After each treatment, Evans blue dye solution was applied to the teeth. Dentin permeability was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-rays (EDX). There were significant differences (p < 0. 0001, ANOVA) among the groups regarding dentin permeability, number of dentinal tubules, diameter of dentinal tubules, and opened tubular area. In the SCT, PCT and PNT groups, opened and partially occluded tubules, deposits, and a few smear layers were observed. In the DW and FT groups, most of the dentinal tubules were open, with no deposits or smear layers on the dentin. EDX revealed peaks of calcium and phosphorus in all of the groups, as well as traces of strontium in the SCT group and of potassium in the PCT and PNT groups.

40|$|Objectives. To {{determine}} the microshear bond strengths of five 'all-in-one' adhesives and two 2 -step self-etching primer adhesives to dentin with different tubule orientations and to compare bond strengths between the adhesives. Material and methods. Human adult molar teeth were sectioned to obtain dentin pieces with tubule orientations perpendicular or parallel/oblique to the bonded surface. Two 2 -step self-etching primer adhesives (Clearfil SE Bond (CSE), Optibond Solo Plus SE Bond (Op. SE)) and five all-in-one adhesives (Clearfil S 3 Bond (S 3), Optibond All-in-One Bond (Op. AIO), G-Bond, Go!, and Xeno IV) {{were applied to}} dentin {{in accordance with the}} manufacturers' instructions. Resin composite cylinders were bonded to superficial and deep dentin using microtubes (0. 75 mm internal diameter and 1. 5 mm high). Bonded specimens were stored in water at 37 °C for 24 h, then stressed in shear at a cross-head speed of 1 mm/min until bond failure. Maximum load at failure (N) was recorded and converted to MPa. Statistical analyses were carried out using independent samples t-test and one-way ANOVA with Tukey's HSD test. Results. Though bond strengths varied slightly, four all-in-one adhesives (Op. AIO, G-Bond, Go!, and Xeno IV) showed no significant differences in microshear bond strengths regardless of dentin depth (superficial or deep) or <b>dentin</b> <b>tubule</b> orientation (perpendicular or parallel/oblique). CSE, Op. SE, and S 3 showed significantly lower bond strengths to deep dentin with a tubule orientation perpendicular to the surface. Conclusion. Most of the all-in-one adhesive systems used in this study appear to bond equally well to dentin independently of tubule orientation and depth. One two-step self-etching primer adhesive bonded significantly better than the all-in-one adhesives. © 2008 Taylor & Francis. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTricho-dento-osseous (TDO) {{syndrome}} is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by abnormalities in the thickness and density of bones and teeth. A 4 -bp deletion mutation in the Distal-Less 3 (DLX 3) gene is etiologic for most cases of TDO. To investigate the in vivo role of mutant DLX 3 (MT-DLX 3) on dentin development, we generated transgenic (TG) mice expressing MT-DLX 3 {{driven by a}} mouse 2. 3 Col 1 A 1 promoter. Dentin defects were radiographically evident in all teeth {{and the size of}} the nonmineralized pulp was enlarged in TG mice, consistent with clinical characteristics in patients with TDO. High-resolution radiography, microcomputed tomography, and SEM revealed a reduced zone of mineralized dentin with anomalies in the number and organization of dentinal tubules in MT-DLX 3 TG mice. Histological and immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that the decreased dentin was accompanied by altered odontoblast cytology that included disruption of odontoblast polarization and reduced numbers of odontoblasts. TUNEL assays indicated enhanced odontoblast apoptosis. Expression levels of the apoptotic marker caspase- 3 were increased in odontoblasts in TG mice as well as in odontoblastic-like MDPC- 23 cells transfected with MT-DLX 3 cDNA. Expression of Runx 2, Wnt 10 A, and TBC 1 D 19 colocalized with DLX 3 expression in odontoblasts, and MT-DLX 3 significantly reduced expression of all three genes. TBC 1 D 19 functions in cell polarity and decreased TBC 1 D 19 expression may contribute to the observed disruption of odontoblast polarity and apoptosis. These data indicate that MT-DLX 3 acts to disrupt odontoblast cytodifferentiation leading to odontoblast apoptosis, and aberrations of <b>dentin</b> <b>tubule</b> formation and dentin matrix production, resulting in decreased dentin and taurodontism. In summary, this TG model demonstrates that MT-DLX 3 has differential effects on matrix production and mineralization in dentin and bone and provides a novel tool for the investigation of odontoblast biology...|$|E

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The methodology used for the measurement of hydraulic conductance of dentin in the present study was based on a model proposed in literature. Thirty-six 1 -mm-thick dentin discs, obtained from extracted human third molars were divided into 4 groups (n= 9). The groups corresponded to the following experimental materials: GI- 10 % propolis gel, pH 4. 1; GII- 30 % propolis gel; GIII- 3 % potassium oxalate gel, pH 4, 1; and GIV- 1. 23 % fluoride gel, pH 4. 1, applied to the dentin under the following surface conditions: after 37 % phosphoric acid and before 6 % citric acid application. The occluding capacity of the <b>dentin</b> <b>tubules</b> was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) at × 500, × 1, 000 and × 2, 000 magnifications. Data were analyzed statistically by two-way ANOVA and Tukey's test at 5 % significance level. RESULTS: Groups I, II, III, IV did not differ significantly from the others in any conditions by reducing in hydraulic conductance. The active agents reduced dentin permeability; however they produced the smallest reduction in hydraulic conductance when compared to the presence of smear layer (P< 0. 05). The effectiveness in reducing dentin permeability did not differ significantly from 10 % or 30 % propolis gels. SEM micrographs revealed that <b>dentin</b> <b>tubules</b> were partially occluded after treatment with propolis. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of this study, the application of 10 % and 30 % propolis gels did not seem to reduce the hydraulic conductance of dentin in vitro, but it showed capacity of partially obliterating the <b>dentin</b> <b>tubules.</b> Propolis is used in the treatment of different oral problems without causing significant great collateral effects, and can be a good option in the treatment of patients with dentin sensitivity...|$|R

Demineralizing agents have been used as an adjunct to the periodontal treatment aiming at restoring the biocompatibility of roots. OBJECTIVE: This study compared four commonly used demineralizing agents for their capacity of removing smear layer and opening dentin tubules. METHODS: Fifty fragments of human dental roots previously exposed to periodontal disease were scaled and randomly divided into the following groups of treatment: 1) CA: demineralization with citric acid for 3 min; 2) TC-HCl: demineralization with tetracycline-HCl for 3 min; 3) EDTA: demineralization with EDTA for 3 min; 4) PA: demineralization with 37 % phosphoric acid for 3 min; 5) Control: rubbing of saline solution for 3 min. Scanning electron microscopy was used to check for the presence of residual smear layer and for measuring the number and area of exposed dentin tubules. RESULTS: Smear layer was present in 100 % of the specimens from the groups PA and control; in 80 % from EDTA group; in 33. 3 % from TC-HCl group and 0 % from CA group. The mean numbers of exposed dentin tubules in a standardized area were: TC-HCl= 43. 8 ± 25. 2; CA= 39. 3 ± 37; PA= 12. 1 ± 16. 3; EDTA= 4. 4 ± 7. 5 and Control= 2. 3 ± 5. 7. The comparison showed significant differences between the following pairs of groups: TC-HCl and Control; TC-HCl and EDTA; CA and Control; and CA and EDTA. The mean percentages of area occupied by exposed dentin tubules were: CA= 0. 12 ± 0. 17 %; TC-HCl= 0. 08 ± 0. 06 %; PA= 0. 03 ± 0. 05 %; EDTA= 0. 01 ± 0. 01 % and Control= 0 ± 0 %.

Methods: Twenty extracted human third molars were selected to prepare dentin discs. Each dentin disc was divided into four areas and was irradiated by 980 -nm diode laser under different parameters: Group A: control group, 0 J/cm²; Group B: 2 W/CW (continuous mode), 166 J/cm²; Group C: 3 W/CW, 250 J/cm²; and Group D: 4 W/CW, 333 J/cm². Ten additional extracted human third molars were selected to prepare dentin discs. Each dentin disc was divided into two areas and was irradiated by 980 -nm diode laser: Group E: control group, 0 J/cm²; and Group F: 2. 0 W/CW, 166 J/cm². The morphological alterations of the dentin surfaces and odontoblasts were examined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the morphological alterations of the dental pulp tissue irradiated by laser were observed with an upright microscope.

Conclusions: Irradiation with 980 -nm diode laser could be effective for routine clinical treatment of DH, and 2. 0 W/CW (166 J/cm²) was a suitable energy parameter due to its rapid sealing of the exposed <b>dentin</b> <b>tubules</b> and its safety to the odontoblasts and pulp tissue. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objective. The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of Nd:YAP laser to seal dentinal tubules at different parameters. Material and Methods. 24 caries-free human wisdom impacted molars were used. The crowns were sectioned transversally in order to totally expose the dentin. The smear layer was removed by a 1 [*]min application of EDTA. Each surface was divided into four quadrants, but only three quadrants were irradiated at a different output power setting (irradiation speed: 1 [*]mm/sec; optical fiber diameter: 320 [*]µm; tangential incidence of beam and in noncontact mode). Samples were smeared with a graphite paste prior to laser irradiation. All specimens were sent for SEM analysis. Pulp temperature increases in additional twenty teeth were measured by a thermocouple. Results. Morphological changes in dentin surfaces depend on the value of used energy density. Higher energy densities (2 [*]W– 4 [*]W; 200 – 400 [*]mJ; pulse duration: 100 [*]m[*]sec.; and 10 [*]Hz) induce higher dentin modifications. Our results confirmed that Nd:YAP laser irradiations can lead to total or partial occlusion of <b>dentin</b> <b>tubules</b> without provoking fissures or cracks. Measurements of pulp temperature increases showed that Nd:YAP laser beam can be considered as harmless for pulp vitality for following irradiation conditions: 2 [*]W (200 [*]mJ) to 4 [*]W (400 [*]mJ) with an irradiation speed of 1 [*]mm/sec; fiber diameter: 320 micrometers; 10 [*]Hz; pulse duration: 100 [*]m[*]sec; noncontact mode and in tangential incidence to exposed dentin. The perpendicular incidence of the laser beam on exposed dentin may injure pulp vitality even at low output power of 3 [*]W. Conclusions. Nd:YAP laser beam was able to seal the <b>dentin</b> <b>tubules</b> without damaging dentinal surfaces and without harming pulp vitality. Nd:YAP laser is effective and may be safely used for future in vivo treatments of dentinal hypersensitivity under certain conditions...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This study {{evaluated}} the differential composition of resin/dentin interfaces of indirect restorations {{created by the}} application of 4 th and 5 th generation dual-curing luting systems (bonding agents/resin cements), when each material was either light cured or allowed to self-cure. Materials and Methods: Occlusal flat dentin surfaces of 60 human third molars were assigned into 12 groups (n = 5) according to curing mode and dual-curing cementing system: 4 th generation All Bond 2 (AB 2) /Duolink (Bisco) and 5 th generation (B 1) Bond 1 /Lute-it (Pentron). Fluorescein-labeled dextran (FDx) was mixed with the bonding agents, while rhodamine-labeled dextran (RhDx) was incorporated into resin cements and Pre-Bond resin from AB 2. Resin cements were applied to 2 -mm-thick, precured resin composite disks (Z 250, 3 M ESPE), which were fixed to dentin surfaces containing adhesive resin in either cured (light cured; LC) or uncured (self-cured; SC) states. The restored teeth were light activated (XL 3000, 3 M ESPE) according to the manufacturers' instructions (LRC) or allowed to self-cure (SRC), were stored for 24 h, and then vertically, serially sectioned into 1 -mm-thick slabs, which were analyzed using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Fluorescent additives indicated where individual components of the bonding/cement systems were located. Additional specimens were prepared and analyzed using a conventional scanning electron microscope. Results: AB 2 /LC and B 1 /LC exhibited nonuniform primer/adhesive layer thickness. AB 2 /SC showed adhesive resin penetration within the primed dentin, and resin cement penetration {{at the entrance of}} the <b>dentin</b> <b>tubules.</b> B 1 /SC/LRC demonstrated resin cement penetration within the hybrid layer and into the <b>dentin</b> <b>tubules.</b> More resin cement penetration was observed in B 1 /SC/SRC groups than in its LRC equivalent. Conclusion: The morphological features and component interactions among materials at resin/dentin interfaces are related to the activation modes of the primer/adhesive layer and of the resin cement used...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the extent of}} water penetration through resin-dentin interfaces before and after being sealed with adhesives. Four adhesive resin systems (2 total-etch adhesives and 2 self-etching primer adhesives) were used in this study. Dentin disks were placed in a split-chamber device, and in situ fluid movement across dentin was measured, with and without physiological pressure, during bonding procedures or 24 hrs after bonding. The fluid movement across dentin occurs via <b>dentin</b> <b>tubules</b> after acid-etching. Large outward or inward fluid shifts across dentin were observed during air-drying and light-curing for resin application. The amount of fluid movement across resin-bonded dentin when total-etch adhesives were used was significantly greater than that with self-etching adhesives. The milder acidetching effects of self-etching primers may retain hybridized smear plugs within the tubules that reduce outward fluid flow, resulting in superior dentin sealing.

40|$|In situ {{formation}} of mineral particles by biocataly-sis would be advantageous for occluding <b>dentin</b> <b>tubules</b> to reduce permeability or for sealing of material-tooth interfaces. One approach {{would require that}} the peptide-catalyst remain functional on the dentin surface. Based on recent observa-tions of retained activity on other surfaces, we hypothesized that poly(L-lysine) (PLL), an analog of the protein catalyst responsible for silica forma-tion in primitive marine species, would remain functional on dentin. PLL was applied to dentin discs along with a pre-hydrolyzed silica precursor, tetramethyl orthosilicate (TMOS). Discs were ana-lyzed microscopically (scanning electron micros-copy, SEM) and chemically (x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, XPS). The treated discs, but not the negative controls, exhibited partial distinct coating whose XPS survey was consistent with that of silica, demonstrating that the polypeptide was required and retained its mediating activity. Peptide-catalysts that mediate mineral formation can retain functionality on dentin, suggesting {{a wide range of}} preventive and treatment strategies...|$|R
40|$|Continuous etching of {{aggressive}} all-in-one adhesives occurs in wet <b>dentin</b> <b>tubules</b> after polymerization of the adhesives. This study challenged {{the hypothesis that}} unpolymerized acidic monomers from an aggressive all-in-one self-etching adhesive continue to etch beyond dentin hybrid layers. Dentin surfaces bonded with Adper Prompt L-Pop were sectioned into 0. 3 -mm-thick slabs. Some of the slabs were stored in water (pH 6. 8) or glycine buffer (pH 11. 1) for six weeks and then examined by CLSM, SEM, and TEM. The rest were immersed in a biomimetic remineralizing medium for up to 4 months. Morphologic analysis indicated no difference in demineralization thickness between the two 6 -week storage groups. However, increased permeability and loss of integrity occurred along {{the base of the}} hybrid layers in the glycine buffer group, but not in the water storage group. These findings were also confirmed by the results of biomimetic remineralization along the bases of those hybrid layers. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
