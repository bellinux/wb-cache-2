25|$|For {{corporate}} or enterprise use, {{a private}} telephone exchange {{is often referred}} to as a private branch exchange (PBX), when it has connections to the public switched telephone network. A PBX is installed in enterprise facilities, typically collocated with large office spaces or within an organizational campus to serve the local private telephone system and any private leased line circuits. Smaller installations might deploy a PBX or <b>key</b> <b>telephone</b> system in the office of a receptionist.|$|E
500|$|The Japanese {{government}} {{also sought to}} improve the country's civil defenses {{in response to the}} Doolittle Raid and the threat of further attacks. The national government placed the burden of constructing civilian air-raid shelters on the prefectural governments. However, few shelters were built due to shortages of concrete and steel. In October 1943 the Home Ministry directed households in the major cities to build their own shelters, though these were normally only trenches. A small number of sophisticated shelters were constructed for air defense headquarters and to protect <b>key</b> <b>telephone</b> facilities. However, less than two percent of civilians had access to bombproof air-raid shelters, though tunnels and natural caves were also used to protect civilians from B-29 raids. Following the outbreak of war, the Home Ministry expanded the number of firefighters, though these generally remained volunteers who lacked adequate training and equipment. Civilians were also trained to fight fires and encouraged to swear an [...] "air defense oath" [...] to respond to attacks from incendiary or high explosive bombs.|$|E
2500|$|Just as the Ulster Volunteers {{knew they}} needed armaments, the British {{authorities}} were keen {{to stop them}} from landing guns on Irish shores. At the end of March 1914, just as the Ulster Volunteers were readying for an imminent civil war, a Norwegian steamer called Fanny was filled full of 35,000 rifles from Germany, and gave its destination as [...] "Öreland" [...] (sic). Two English-speaking people were said to be on board. The owners of the ship insisted that the destination was in fact South America, and some connected the cargo with the Mexican Revolution, but on 25 April the Fanny (disguised as the Mountjoy) landed its cargo at Larne, Bangor and Donaghadee having outwitted Customs. The Ulster Volunteers had been given a general mobilisation order on Friday 24 April and made sure that all roads leading to the disembarking centres had been blocked and that <b>key</b> <b>telephone</b> wires had been cut. 500 cars were used to distribute the rifles.|$|E

The studies reported bear on this question and also on questions of how people process information when <b>keying</b> <b>telephone</b> numbers. Four categories of design features were studied: key arrangement, force-displacement characteristics, button-top design and central office factors. The results indicate that considerable lati-tude exists for key set design in terms of user performance; however, the preference judgments are more selective. The studies also showed that {{the manner in which}} the person acquired and <b>keyed</b> the <b>telephone</b> number influenced performance appreciably.

50|$|A 66 {{block is}} a type of punchdown block used to connect sets of wires in a {{telephone}} system. They have been manufactured in three sizes, A, B, and M. A and B have six clips in each row while M has only 4. The A blocks spaced the rows farther apart, and has been obsolete for many years. The B style is used mainly in distribution panels where several destinations (often 1A2 <b>key</b> <b>telephones)</b> need to connect to the same source. The M blocks are often used to connect a single instrument to such a distribution block. 66 blocks are designed to terminate 22 through 26 AWG solid copper wire. The 66 series connecting block, introduced in the Bell System in 1962, was the first terminating device with insulation displacement connector technology. The term 66 block reflects its Western Electric model number.|$|R

40|$|Post-consumer {{goods in}} the form of metal/plastics {{composites}} scrap lend themselves for metal and polymer recycling. For the recovery of the respective resource fractions, commercially proven mineral raw material processing technologies can be adapted and further developed. Such technologies include liberation comminution to separate the metal/polymer composites, classification and sorting to recover the resources at maximum purity. In a series of basic laboratory and pilot-scale tests, 20 tons of consumer goods scrap, classified by beneficiation criteria and polymer content, were reprocessed. ABS from vacuum cleaners and PP from coffee machines were recovered at purities of > 99 % and PVC from keyboard at a purity of abt. 91 %. Metal and polymer yields were 85 and 62 and 76 mass % respectively. In a next step, 340 tons of consumer goods scrap were continuously processed in bulk in a demonstration plant, applying a feed rate of 350 to 500 kg/h in the dry processing units and of 230 - 250 kg/h in the wet processing units. The following recycling rates were achieved: 62 % for small household appliances (ABS, PP, PC, metals), 82 % for pre-comminuted Deutsche Bundespost telephones (ABS, metals), 57 % for <b>key</b> <b>telephones</b> of various designs (ABS, metals) 82 % for automotive rear and flashing lamps (ABS/PMMA) and 87 % for pre-comminuted car bumpers (TPE/EPDM). Continuous bulk reprocessing of consumer goods scrap presupposes volumes which can only be realized by legislative measures (product take-back regulations). The recycling rates can be further improved through optimization of the liberation comminution technologies. (orig.)

He wrote a total of 14 novels in the Oz series, plus 41 other novels, 83 short stories, over 200 poems, and at least 42 scripts. He made numerous attempts to bring his works to the stage and the nascent medium of film; the 1939 adaptation of the first Oz book would become a landmark of 20th century cinema. His works anticipated such century-later commonplaces as television, augmented reality, laptop computers (The Master <b>Key),</b> wireless <b>telephones</b> (Tik-Tok of Oz), women in high-risk and action-heavy occupations (Mary Louise in the Country), and the ubiquity of advertising on clothing (Aunt Jane's Nieces at Work).|$|R
