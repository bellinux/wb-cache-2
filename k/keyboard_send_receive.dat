50|$|When a key is pressed, {{released}} or held down, the <b>keyboard</b> <b>sends</b> {{a packet}} of information known as a scan code to the computer. The protocol used to transmit these scan codes is a bidirectional serial communication, based on four wires: Vcc (5 volts), ground, data and clock. Clock and data signals are identically generated. Hence, the compromising emanation detected is the combination of both signals. However, {{the edges of the}} data and the clock lines are not superposed. Thus, they can be easily separated to obtain independent signals.|$|R

40|$|Algorithms for vector {{timestamps}} {{have been}} developed to determine the “happened before” relations between events of an execution of a message passing program. Many message passing programs contain variables shared by multiple processes (including threads). Such programs need to have vector timestamps for <b>send,</b> <b>receive,</b> read and write events. We define two “happened-before” relations, called strong happened-before (SHB) and weak happened-before (WHB), between events of an execution involving <b>send,</b> <b>receive,</b> read and write statements. We then present two timestamp assignment algorithms, one for SHB and the other for WHB, and show how to use such timestamps to determine the SHB or WHB relation between any two events of an execution involving <b>send,</b> <b>receive,</b> read and write statements. For a program containing n processes, the size of a vector timestamp for SHB or WHB is n, regardless of the number of shared variables in the program. Finally, we show how to apply WHB timestamps to perform race analysis for programs using messages and shared variable...|$|R

The keyboard switch matrix is wired to its inputs, it converts the keystrokes to key codes, and, for a detached <b>keyboard,</b> <b>sends</b> the codes down a serial cable (the keyboard cord) to the main processor on the computer motherboard.

25|$|A {{keyboard}} is {{the device}} {{most commonly used}} for writing via computer. Each key {{is associated with a}} standard code which the <b>keyboard</b> <b>sends</b> to the computer when it is pressed. By using a combination of alphabetic keys with modifier keys such as Ctrl, Alt, Shift and AltGr, various character codes are generated and sent to the CPU. The operating system intercepts and converts those signals to the appropriate characters based on the keyboard layout and input method, and then delivers those converted codes and characters to the running application software, which in turn looks up the appropriate glyph in the currently used font file, and requests the operating system to draw these on the screen.|$|R
50|$|An {{electronic}} instrument might include a user interface for controlling its sound, often {{by adjusting the}} pitch, frequency, or duration of each note. A common user interface is the musical keyboard, which functions similarly to the keyboard on an acoustic piano, except that with an electronic keyboard, the keyboard itself does not make any sound. An electronic <b>keyboard</b> <b>sends</b> a signal to a synth module, computer or other electronic or digital sound generator, which then creates a sound. However, it is increasingly common to separate user interface and sound-generating functions into a music controller (input device) and a music synthesizer, respectively, with the two devices communicating through a musical performance description language such as MIDI or Open Sound Control.|$|R
