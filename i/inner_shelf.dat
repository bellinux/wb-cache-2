25|$|The depositional {{environment}} {{of the majority of}} Burgess-Shale-type assemblages is outer shelf, deeper water. The Emu Bay Shale in contrast, appears to represent deposition in restricted basins on the <b>inner</b> <b>shelf,</b> indicating that soft tissue preservation occurred in a range of environmental settings during the Cambrian. Some Emu Bay fossils display extensive mineralization of soft tissues, most often of blocky apatite or fibrous calcium carbonate, including the oldest phosphatized muscle tissue – along with records from Sirius Passet in Greenland, the first thus far reported from the Cambrian. Mid-gut glands are preserved three-dimensionally in calcium phosphate in the arthropods Isoxys and Oestokerkus, as in related species from the Burgess Shale.|$|E

It {{is strange}} that, after much hunting, I cannot find {{authentic}} {{note of the}} day when Scotland took the thistle for her emblem; and I have no space (in this chapter at least) for tradition; but, with whatever lightness of construing we may receive the symbol, it is actually the truest that could have been found, for some conditions of the Scottish mind. There is no flower which the Proserpina of our Northern Sicily cherishes more dearly: and scarcely any of us recognize enough the beautiful power of its close-set stars, and rooted radiance of ground leaves; yet the stubbornness and ungraceful rectitude of its stem, and the besetting of its wholesome substance with that fringe of offence, and the forwardness of it, and dominance,--I fear to lacess some of my dearest friends if I went on:--let them rather, with Bailie Jarvie's true conscience,[33] take their Scott from the <b>inner</b> <b>shelf</b> in their heart's library which all true Scotsmen give him, and trace, with the swift reading of memory, the characters of Fergus M'Ivor, Hector M'Intyre, Mause Headrigg, Alison Wilson, Richie {123} Moniplies, and Andrew Fairservice; and then say, if the faults of all these, drawn as they are with a precision of touch like a Corinthian sculptor's of the acanthus leaf, can be found in anything like the same strength in other races, or if so stubbornly folded and starched moni-plies of irritating kindliness, selfish friendliness, lowly conceit, and intolerable fidelity, are native to any other spot of the wild earth of the habitable globe.|$|E

5000|$|Glacial erosion has {{produced}} an over-deepened glacial trough on the <b>inner</b> <b>shelf,</b> up to 2,100 m in depth locally, {{and most of}} the <b>inner</b> <b>shelf</b> area is characterised by exposed basement rocks as seen on GI-gun seismic profiles. Glacial marine sedimentation processes in the bay are characterised by siliciclastic sediments dominating over biogenic sediments even in deep, <b>inner</b> <b>shelf</b> troughs. [...] Water circulation in the Bay involves landward flow at depth, bringing warmer ocean water into contact with the base of the Vanderford Glacier. This water becomes mixed with fresh meltwater and suspended glacial sediments to form a buoyant plume that rises and flows in a seaward direction under the ice shelf.|$|E
40|$|On {{parts of}} glaciated {{continental}} margins, especially the <b>inner</b> <b>shelves</b> around Antarctica, grounded ice has removed pre-existing sedimentary cover, leaving subglacial bedforms on eroded substrates (Anderson et al. 2001; Wellner et al. 2001). While the dominant subglacial bedforms often follow a distinct, relatively uniform pattern {{that can be}} related to overall trends in palaeo-ice flow and substrate geology (Wellner et al. 2006), others are more randomly distributed and may reflect local substrate variations. Here we describe and discuss examples of large, isolated crag-and-tail features that are recognized on the Amundsen Sea continental shelf...|$|R

40|$|A {{new model}} is {{presented}} {{that addresses the}} occurrence of sorted bedforms on <b>inner</b> <b>shelves</b> of coastal seas. These features consist of alternating bands of coarse and fine grains, with small topographic undulations. We show that inherent feedbacks between alongshore currents, sea waves, bottom topography and roughness variations result {{in the emergence of}} morphological patterns, similar to the observed bed features. We find that two modes are amplified which display different characteristics, yielding a possible explanation to the diversity exhibited by sorted bedforms in the field. The results illustrate that both roughness variations and bottom topography influence the generation of sorted bedforms. Citation: Van Oyen, T., H. E. de Swart, and P. Blondeaux (2010), Bottom topography and roughness variations as triggering mechanisms to the formation of sorted bedforms...|$|R

50|$|The Brazilian {{guitarfish}} is a low-fecundity viviparous fish. Mating {{takes place}} on the inner continental shelf in March and soon afterwards the adults disperse to outer areas of the shelf. The eggs are contained within a casing and remain dormant inside the female until she return to the warm, shallow waters of the inner continental shelf in November. The young develop inside the female, at first obtaining nourishment from their yolk sacs, and later from maternal uterine secretions; they grow from a length of about 1 cm in December to about 29 cm in February when they are born. The females mature at about 4 {{years of age and}} litter sizes range from 4 to 12, with larger fish having larger litters. The <b>inner</b> <b>shelf</b> provides important nursery areas for the young fish. Here both females and juveniles are particularly susceptible to being caught by pair-trawling and beach seine netting. Most of the catch is pregnant females. Later in the year, the adults disperse more widely over the <b>inner</b> <b>shelf</b> and are caught by otter-trawling.|$|E

50|$|In the Middle Atlantic Bight, scup spawn {{along the}} <b>inner</b> {{continental}} <b>shelf.</b> Their larvae {{end up in}} inshore waters, along the coast and in estuarine areas. At 2 to 3 years of age, they mature. Scup winter along the mid and outer continental shelf. When the temperature warms in the spring they migrate inshore.|$|R
5000|$|A southwesterly ocean current, (occasionally {{containing}} {{runoff from}} the Gulf of St Lawrence) flows over the <b>inner</b> <b>shelf.</b> The water flow over the banks is weaker and tends have greater variation. The Scotian Shelf contains a canyon called the [...] "Gully", {{which is more}} than 1000 m deep. Currents flow through this canyon southward, mixing offshore waters with the Nova Scotia Current. This causes an increase in biological productivity toward the east, across the Continental Shelf.|$|E
5000|$|After the {{generally}} transgressive Ligerian (in comparison with its underlying Cenomanian) dominated by open marine deposits, the Angoumian clearly shows a regressive trend. This fact combined with {{the generally}} warm climate during the Turonian allowed {{the temperature of the}} sea-water to reach unprecedented values on the <b>inner</b> <b>shelf</b> of the northern Aquitaine Basin (peaking at roughly 10 °C above today's ocean temperatures during the lower Angoumian) [...] - together with the reigning calm conditions an ideal environment for the widespread expansion of rudist reefs.|$|E
50|$|During {{the lower}} Angoumian (Angoulême Formation), a muddy, {{calcareous}} lagoon had established {{itself on the}} <b>inner</b> <b>shelf</b> with a low to moderate energy level. The lagoon was fringed or interspersed with extensive rudist reefs shedding their debris mainly towards the open sea. A major reef extended from Périgueux northwestwards thus isolating an inner platform northeast and east of Périgueux from an outer shelf towards {{the centre of the}} Aquitaine Basin. On the high(er) energy side of the individual reefs, the more clastic dominated members formed, whereas in the calm inner lagoon, the cryptocrystalline and micritic members were deposited.|$|E

50|$|Modern {{seafloor}} mapping {{technologies have}} revealed linkages between seafloor geomorphology and benthic habitats, in which suites of benthic communities {{are associated with}} specific geomorphic settings. Examples include cold-water coral communities associated with seamounts and submarine canyons, kelp forests associated with <b>inner</b> <b>shelf</b> rocky reefs and rockfish associated with rocky escarpments on continental slopes. In oceanic environments, benthic habitats can also be zoned by depth. From the shallowest to the deepest are: the epipelagic (less than 200 meters), the mesopelagic (200-1,000 metres), the bathyal (1,000-4,000 meters), the abyssal (4,000-6,000 meters) and the deepest, the hadal (below 6,000 meters).|$|E
5000|$|Marine environments such as outer and <b>inner</b> <b>shelf,</b> {{platform}} reef, {{and near}} shore beach and lagoon, are all represented within the [...] "Imperial Formation".
