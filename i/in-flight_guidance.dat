2500|$|Railguns face {{a host of}} {{technical}} challenges before they {{will be ready for}} battlefield deployment. First, the rails guiding the projectile must carry very high power. Each firing of the railgun produces tremendous current flow (almost half a million amperes) through the rails, causing rapid erosion of the rail's surfaces (through ohmic heating, and even vaporization of the rail surface.) [...] Early prototypes were essentially single-use weapons, requiring complete replacement of the rails after each firing. Another challenge with the railgun system is projectile survivability. The projectiles experience acceleration force in excess of 100,000g. In order to be effective, the fired projectile must first survive the mechanical stress of firing and the thermal effects of a trip through the atmosphere at many times the speed of sound before its subsequent impact with the target. <b>In-flight</b> <b>guidance,</b> if implemented, would require the onboard navigation system to be built to the same level of sturdiness as the main mass of the projectile.|$|E

40|$|A Legendre Pseudospectral Method {{for launch}} vehicle {{trajectory}} optimization, pro­ posed by Mike Ross and Fariba Fahroo of the Naval Postgraduate School, is presented and applied successfully to several launch problems. The method uses a Legendre pseudospectral differentiation matrix to discretize nonlinear differential equations (such as the equations of motion) into nonlinear algebraic equations. The equations are then posed {{in the form}} of a nonlinear optimization problem and solved numerically. The method is demonstrated to work very well with both continuous and discontinuous states and controls. The method is applied to the following launch problems: the single-stage and two-stage Goddard problem; a simplified, single-stage, two-dimensional launch problem; and a two-stage, three-dimensional launch problem. A technique for reducing the size of problems with second order differential equations is presented and applied. This technique is shown to increase the speed of convergence of some problems. A predictive guidance algorithm demonstrates the feasibility of using the method to find both open- and closed-loop controls for a single-stage, three dimensional launch problem. The effects of different aerodynamic models between the optimizer and the "real" simulation are briefly analyzed. A number of issues that need to be resolved before the algorithm can be used <b>in-flight</b> for closed-loop <b>guidance</b> are describedby Jeremy Ryan Rea. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|The APE-THESEO {{campaign}} was held from 15 February to 15 March 1999 from the Seychelles {{in the western}} Indian Ocean. APE-THESEO stands for Airborne Platform for Earth observation — (contribution to) the Third European Stratospheric Experiment on Ozone. The campaign aimed to study processes controlling the low water content of the stratosphere, including the mechanisms of cloud formation in the tropical tropopause region, and transport processes, studied using measurements of long-lived trace gases and ozone. Two aircraft were used: the high-altitude research aircraft, M- 55 Geophysica, which can fly up to 21 km, and the Falcon of the Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt, a tropospheric aircraft. Seven flights were performed, including the first simultaneous in situ and remote sensing of sub-visible cirrus clouds, the first interception of sub-visible cirrus using <b>in-flight</b> <b>guidance</b> from a path-finding aircraft, and guided descent of a high-altitude research aircraft into the anvil cloud {{at the top of}} a tropical cyclone. In this paper we describe the payload used, the objectives for each flight, and the meteorological conditions encountered. First results show that a new type of cloud, which we have dubbed ultra-thin tropical tropopause cloud (UTTC), has been observed frequently, and observed to cover areas of 105 km 2. The frequent coincidence of the tropopause and hygropause implies that the western Indian Ocean played an important role in the dehydration of the lower tropical stratosphere during the season of the mission. UTTCs, sub-visible cirrus, and visible cirrus, have all been implicated in the observed dehydration. Tracer measurements indicate little mixing of stratospheric air into the upper tropical troposphere...|$|E
40|$|A primary, ACE-Asia {{objective}} was to quantify the interactions between aerosols and radiation in the Asia-Pacific region. Toward this end, radiometric and related aerosol measurements were made from ocean, land, air and space platforms. Models that predict aerosol fields guided the measurements and are helping integrate and interpret results. Companion overview's survey these measurement and modeling components. Here we illustrate how these components were combined to determine aerosol radiative. impacts and their relation to aerosol properties. Because clouds can obscure or change aerosol direct radiative effects, aircraft and ship sorties to measure these effects depended on predicting and finding cloud-free areas and times with interesting aerosols present. Pre-experiment satellite cloud climatologies, pre-flight aerosol and cloud forecasts, and <b>in-flight</b> <b>guidance</b> from satellite imagery all helped achieve this. Assessments of aerosol regional radiative impacts benefit from the spatiotemporal coverage of satellites, provided satellite-retrieved aerosol properties are accurate. Therefore, ACE-Asia included satellite retrieval tests, as part of many comparisons to judge the consistency (closure) among, diverse measurements. Early results include: (1) Solar spectrally resolved and broadband irradiances and optical depth measurements from the C- 130 aircraft and at Kosan, Korea yielded aerosol radiative forcing efficiencies, permitting comparisons between efficiencies of ACE-Asia and INDOEX aerosols, and between dust and "pollution" aerosols. Detailed results will be presented in separate papers. (2) Based on measurements of wavelength dependent aerosol optical depth (AOD) and single scattering albedo the estimated 24 -h a average aerosol radiative forcing efficiency at the surface for photosynthetically active radiation (400 - 700 nm) in Yulin, China is approx. 30 W sq m per AOD(500 nm). (3) The R/V Brown cruise from Honolulu to Sea of Japan sampled an aerosol optical depth gradient, with AOD(500 nm) extremes from 0. 1 to 1. 1. On the Pacific transit from Honolulu to Hachijo AOD(500 nm) averaged 0. 2, including increases to 0. 4 after several storms, suggesting the strong impact of wind-generated seasalt. The AOD maximum, found in the Sea of Japan, was influenced by dust and anthropogenic sources. (4) In Beijing, single scattering albedo retrieved from AERONET sun-sky radiometry yielded midvisible SSA= 0. 88 with strong wavelength dependence, suggesting a significant black carbon component. SSA retrieved during dust episodes was approx. 0. 90 and variable but wavelength neutral reflecting the presence of urban haze with the dust. Downwind at Anmyon Island SSA was considerably higher, approx. 0. 94, but wavelength neutral for dust episodes and spectrally dependent during non dust periods. (5) Satellite retrievals show major aerosol features moving from Asia over the Pacific; however, determining seasonal-average aerosol effects is hampered by sampling frequency and large-scale cloud systems that obscure key parts of aerosol patterns. Preliminary calculations using, satellite-retrieved AOD fields and initial ACE-Asia aerosol properties (including sulfates, soot, and dust) yield clear-sky aerosol radiative effects in the seasonal-average ACE-Asia plume exceeding those of manmade greenhouse gases. Quantifying all-sky direct aerosol radiative effects {{is complicated by the}} need to define the height of absorbing aerosols with respect to cloud decks...|$|E
