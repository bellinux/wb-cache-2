5|$|This attack, {{and similar}} attacks {{carried out by}} the GAL, became a major issue during the 1996 Spanish general {{election}} after a Supreme court trial established that the Spanish Interior Ministry had provided clandestine funding for the GAL. Spanish Interior Minister José Barrionuevo and his security chief, Rafael Vera, were <b>jailed</b> <b>for</b> ten years for sanctioning a kidnapping and misappropriation of public funds to finance the group, and the GAL scandal is seen as a key factor in the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) losing the election, though more senior figures in the PSOE, such as Felipe Gonzalez, denied knowledge and involvement.|$|E

5|$|As the Monbar {{case and}} similar cases came to light, the GAL issue became {{increasingly}} controversial in the 1990s, with questions over whether {{members of the}} Spanish government and state security service had known about the group's operations in places like Bayonne and, if so, to what extent they had supported and funded the attacks. This became a major issue during the 1996 Spanish general election with Spanish Interior Minister, José Barrionuevo, and his security chief, Rafael Vera, implicated in the GAL case. In 1998, both were <b>jailed</b> <b>for</b> ten years for sanctioning a kidnapping and {{misappropriation of public funds}} to finance the GAL. Along with various corruption scandals and the poor state of the Spanish economy in the mid-1990s, the GAL scandal is seen as a key factor in the PSOE defeat.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on February 25, 2008, I-75 closed {{completely}} to traffic {{in both directions}} from Rosa Parks Boulevard (exit49) to Clark Street (exit47) in Detroit. This facilitated the complete rebuilding of the road {{as part of the}} Ambassador Gateway Project to better connect I-75 and I-96 to the Ambassador Bridge. Through traffic on I-75 was rerouted along I-94 to I-275 and local detours were posted. The freeway reopened to traffic in June 2009, five months ahead of schedule. The overall project to realign and connect the bridge to the freeways was mired in lawsuits between MDOT and the private company that owns the bridge. The company's owner was <b>jailed</b> <b>for</b> contempt of court during court proceedings in early 2012. MDOT was later ordered to assume responsibility for construction, and the department completed the project on September 21, 2012.|$|E
5|$|Chotiner {{continued}} to practice law. In 1962, his wife Ruth obtained an interlocutory divorce decree against him. After the decree became final, Chotiner married again in 1965.

Chotiner had represented Hinman's wife in a contested divorce case, and Hinman had been <b>jailed</b> <b>for</b> eleven days for failure to pay his fees. No actual attempt on his life took place. Hinman was sentenced to between one and five years in prison. In 1957, one of Chotiner's divorce clients had been killed along with her daughter by the client's estranged husband in the attorney's Beverly Hills office.|$|E
