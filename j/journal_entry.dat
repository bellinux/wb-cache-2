5|$|Even so, Christians {{have noted}} with concern the {{disintegration}} of traditional Huaorani culture and westernization of the tribe, beginning with Nate Saint's own <b>journal</b> <b>entry</b> in 1955 and continuing through today. However, many continue to view as positive both Operation Auca and the subsequent missionary efforts of Rachel Saint, mission organizations such as Mission Aviation Fellowship, Wycliffe Bible Translators, HCJB World Radio, Avant Ministries (formerly Gospel Missionary Union), and others. Specifically, they note the decline in violence among tribe members, numerous conversions to Christianity, and growth of the local church.|$|E
5|$|Mexican Colonel Juan Almonte, Santa Anna's aide-de-camp, {{recorded}} the Texian fatality toll as 250 in his March 6 <b>journal</b> <b>entry.</b> He listed the survivors as five women, one Mexican soldier and one slave. Almonte did not record names, and his count was {{based solely on}} who was there during the final assault. Santa Anna reported to Mexico's Secretary of War Tornel that Texian fatalities exceeded 600. Historians Jack Jackson and John Wheat attributed that high figure to Santa Anna's playing to his political base.|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{examines}} how the auditing of <b>journal</b> <b>entries</b> can detect and prevent financial statement fraud. Financial statement fraud occurs when an intentional act causes financial statements to be materially misstated. Although {{it is not}} a new phenomenon, financial statement fraud has attracted much publicity in the wake of numerous cases of financial malfeasance (e. g. ENRON, WorldCom). Existing literature has provided limited empirical evidence on the link between auditing <b>journal</b> <b>entries</b> and financial statement fraud. The lack of evidence contrasts sharply with the responsibility of auditors to test the appropriateness of <b>journal</b> <b>entries</b> recorded in a general ledger. It becomes more pronounced when considering that <b>journal</b> <b>entries</b> pose a high risk of financial statement fraud, as the case of WorldCom has demonstrated. It is further exacerbated given that fraud results in considerable costs to a number of parties, for example: auditors may be exposed to litigation; investors may experience negative stock returns; and, capital markets may suffer from reduced liquidity. Motivated by these considerations, the thesis adopts the tenets of design-science research in order to develop three quantitative models for auditing <b>journal</b> <b>entries.</b> It first employs self-organizing map and extreme value theory to design the models as constructs. Subsequently, it codes the constructs in MATLAB to build functioning instantiations; and finally, it evaluates the instantiations by conducting a series of experiments on an accounting dataset containing <b>journal</b> <b>entries.</b> The contribution of the thesis lies in the proposed models and their potential applications in accounting. The first model can assist management to monitor the processing of <b>journal</b> <b>entries</b> as well as to assess the accuracy of financial statements. The second model can detect novel <b>journal</b> <b>entries</b> that differ from legitimate <b>journal</b> <b>entries</b> {{to such an extent that}} they could be ‘suspicious’. The third model can identify those <b>journal</b> <b>entries</b> that have both a very low probability of occurring and a monetary amount large enough to materially misstate financial statements. The thesis has a novelty value in that it investigates financial statement fraud from the unexplored perspective of <b>journal</b> <b>entries.</b> The thesis can lead to concrete practical applications in accounting, as the models can be implemented as a Computerised Assisted Audit Technique. This potentiality can be the focal point of additional research...|$|R

5|$|The player must explore solar systems, gather clues, {{and find}} special {{artifacts}} that grant {{access to the}} Crystal Planet, ultimately destroying it before the player's home system flares. Commander McConnell's last <b>journal</b> <b>entry</b> {{can be found on}} the surface of the Crystal Planet; in it, he shares his discovery that Endurium is actually a race of living, sentient beings who are being burned up as fuel for interstellar travel. Because their metabolism is extremely slow due to their crystalline makeup, they are not even aware of outside life and have come to view other races as a virus. The game is won after the player successfully plants an artifact on the Crystal Planet's surface and retreats back into space, causing the planet to explode, though the game can still be played after the Crystal Planet is destroyed.|$|E

25|$|Ouabano was {{a band of}} Mohicans or Eastern Lenape, {{like the}} others {{westerly}} of the state, who traded with the Spanish before the French arrival. It was Minsis and Mohican who led some Shawnee from Lower Ohio Valley in 1692 to join the Minisink villagers of the Delaware (Hanna 1911:158). Soon, these provided guides followed by the Viele of Albany Expedition. The Shawnee arrived later in the century by 1697 on the Eastern Panhandle with Sauvanoos from the south east colonies (Darlington; Hanna). Batts and Fallams, 1671, briefly mentions an abandoned Mohican village (Mohecan as transcribed <b>journal</b> <b>entry</b> date September 16, 1671, Summers 1929) on the Kanawha-New River area.

The journal entries for 18–26 January record first impressions on arrival including interactions with Aboriginal communities and descriptions of the vegetation, intense heat and native wildlife. The convicts and their children who disembarked the Lady Penrhyn at Port Jackson are listed. His first <b>journal</b> <b>entry</b> dated 22 March 1787 records the full crew list and the women convicts, their name, age, trade, crime and term of transportation.

The Lady Penryhn, under charter to the East India Company to continue her voyage to China for a cargo of tea, departed Port Jackson in early May. His journal continues, recording the return voyage via Lord Howe Island, Tahiti, China, St Helena and finally England. The original journal is now in the collection of the National Library of Australia with manuscript copies in the British Library and State Library of New South Wales.|$|E
