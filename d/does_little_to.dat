5|$|Paulo {{was written}} to be unlikable, {{with the hope}} he would redeem himself when his backstory was {{revealed}} in his final episode. Paulo either resents or is indifferent toward the often heroic actions {{of some of the}} survivors, spending much of his time golfing. He complains to Nikki about not being included; however, he <b>does</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> help out around the camp and does not try to improve his status in the survivors' hierarchy. When he does get chances to participate in treks, for example, when Hurley finds a car, Paulo is uninterested and discourages Nikki from joining Hurley on his adventure. Nikki tries to participate, tending to a wounded Mr. Eko and volunteering to go with Locke to the Pearl station, much to the surprise of Paulo. Paulo accompanies her, and he exhibits a constant sarcastic behavior in the Pearl.|$|E

25|$|Ryan Yllana as Bobby - {{is one of}} Tengs best friends. A {{frequent}} joker who seldom takes anything seriously, and {{is frequently}} teased for his weight. The fact that he really likes to eat <b>does</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> stave off those remarks. In one episode, he {{was referred to as}} Captain Baboy (baboy, meaning pig in English language), in reference to his compulsive eating habits. Bobby is aware of Tengs superheroic alter ego, and is his confidant.|$|E
25|$|According to the World Bank {{forced begging}} is most {{commonly}} found in the Middle East and countries of West Africa, where laws prohibiting begging are scarce and heavy regulation of trafficking absent. In Zimbabwe, where child begging is especially prominent, the United Nations has indicated many contradictions between the Labour Act of Zimbabwe and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Many nations, such as Indonesia, have laws against begging on the books, but the repercussions for such entail temporary detainment and eventual release back onto the streets, which <b>does</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> combat the issue.|$|E

25|$|In most {{film and}} radio adaptations of the story, Bombadil is notable by his absence (an {{exception}} is the Mind's Eye recordings). Peter Jackson stated that the reason the character was omitted from his film was because, in the view him and his co-writers, Bombadil <b>does</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> advance the story, and would make their film unnecessarily long. Christopher Lee concurred, stating the scenes were left out to make time for showing Saruman's capture of Gandalf. Some of Bombadil's dialogue, {{as well as the}} scene in which the hobbits meet Old Man Willow, are transferred into scenes which Merry and Pippin share with Treebeard in Jackson's adaptation, included in the extended edition DVD.|$|E
25|$|Details of the Clean Air Act were {{revealed}} on October 19, 2006 by Harper along with Environment Minister Rona Ambrose and Transport Minister Lawrence Cannon. Its main {{plan was to}} reduce greenhouse emissions at about 45-65% of the 2003 levels. The goal was set for the year 2050 while a decrease of greenhouse emissions would be noticed in 2020. There were also regulations set for vehicle fuel consumption for 2011, while new measures would be set for industries starting in 2010. Finally, oil companies will have to reduce gas emissions for each barrel produced. However, companies can increase their production until 2020. The plan was heavily criticized by opposition parties and several environmental groups, with New Democratic Party leader Jack Layton stating that the act <b>does</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> prevent climate change. Since the opposition threatened to turn this into an election issue, the Conservative Party agreed to rework the act.|$|E
25|$|Natives of Buka and Bougainville at the {{northern}} Solomon Islands in Melanesia and the Chopi people of Mozambique in the southeast coast of Africa have darker skin than other surrounding populations. (The native people of Bougainville, Papua New Guinea, {{have some of the}} darkest skin pigmentation in the world.) Although these people are widely separated they share similar physical environments. In both regions, they experience very high UVR exposure from cloudless skies near the equator which is reflected from water or sand. Water reflects, depending on colour, about 10 to 30% of UVR, that falls on it. People in these populations spend long hours fishing on the sea. Because it is impractical to wear extensive clothing in a watery environment culture and technology <b>does</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> buffer UVR exposure. The skin takes a very large amount of UVR radiation. These populations are probably near or at the maximum darkness that human skin can achieve.|$|E

While the CCTs helped women in some positive ways, Franzoni and Voorend argue that the CCTs <b>did</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> change the [...] "patriarchal maternalism", or the viewing of women primarily as mothers instead of workers or citizens, which shapes Latin American social policy.|$|R
25|$|It is hard {{to clarify}} {{with any degree of}} {{certainty}} the exact concepts within kabbalah. There are several different schools of thought with very different outlooks; however, all are accepted as correct. Modern halakhic authorities have tried to narrow the scope and diversity within kabbalah, by restricting study to certain texts, notably Zohar and the teachings of Isaac Luria as passed down through Hayyim ben Joseph Vital. However, even this qualification <b>does</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> limit the scope of understanding and expression, as included in those works are commentaries on Abulafian writings, Sefer Yetzirah, Albotonian writings, and the Berit Menuhah, which is known to the kabbalistic elect and which, as described more recently by Gershom Scholem, combined ecstatic with theosophical mysticism. It is therefore important to bear in mind when discussing things such as the sephirot and their interactions that one is dealing with highly abstract concepts that at best can only be understood intuitively.|$|E

500|$|As the {{infection}} spreads, Israel abandons the Palestinian territories and initiates a nationwide cordon sanitaire, closing its borders to everyone except uninfected Jews and Palestinians. Its military then puts down an ultra-Orthodox uprising, which is later {{referred to as}} an Israeli Civil War. The United States <b>does</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> prepare because it is overconfident {{in its ability to}} suppress any threat. Although special forces teams contain initial outbreaks, a widespread effort never starts: the nation is deprived of political will by [...] "brushfire wars", and a widely distributed and marketed placebo vaccine, Phalanx, creates a false sense of security.|$|E
500|$|Both Simmons and Matos {{criticized the}} story; Simmons felt that {{although}} the narrative is [...] "meticulously delivered", it [...] "felt a bit incidental", and said that in comparison to Zeus and Ares, [...] "the Furies don't quite cut it". Matos was critical of the plot framing and the narrative structure as [...] "just too chaotic"; he argued that [...] "the narrative fabric woven throughout the franchise has begun to split", and Ascension <b>does</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> enhance its characters [...] "in any meaningful way". He did praise the game for providing the [...] "distinct God of War flair" [...] known to the series.|$|E

500|$|The {{book was}} {{published}} by Tor Books as a hardcover and paperback in September 2009. To help with its promotion a 39-second video trailer was produced. Compared to Rod Serling and The Twilight Zone: The 50th Anniversary Tribute, which was reviewed by writer Elizabeth Hand as [...] "a piece of hagiography that <b>does</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> illuminate Serling's genius or the enduring appeal of his most famous creation", the anthology was called [...] "a far superior homage to Serling". In her Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction column Hand listed Hagberg's [...] "Genesis" [...] are the best story in the anthology though Lansdale's and Stine's are also good. She called Rod Serling's and Strieber's stories [...] "the only real misfires".|$|E
500|$|Other reviews {{were less}} complimentary. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. Vitaris wrote, [...] "there are some {{powerful}} and touching moments in 'Sein und Zeit', but others that miss the mark so widely that {{it hurts to}} think what this episode might have been." [...] Kenneth Silber from Space.com, although complimentary towards the focus on Samantha Mulder, was critical of the slowness of the episode, writing, [...] "While the series' reversion to its central theme is much appreciated, this episode unfolds with an unfortunate slowness that <b>does</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> satisfy the seven-year itch many X-Files viewers have come to feel in response to monster-of-the-week episodes and phony-baloney mythology cliffhangers." ...|$|E
500|$|Reaction from {{groups have}} been mixed. The journal Leonardo noted some feminists' {{negative}} reaction to her design; though males were identifying with their feminine side through Croft, she reinforced unrealistic ideals about the female body. Australian feminist scholar Germaine Greer criticised her as an embodiment of male fantasies. PlayStation Magazine staff commented that Croft {{could be seen as}} either a role model for young independent girls or the embodiment of a male adolescent fantasy, though later stated that the character <b>does</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> attract female demographics and was obviously designed with a male audience in mind. The editors also criticised Core Design's hypocritical attempts to downplay the character's sex appeal in public statements while releasing advertisements that prominently featured Lara Croft's sexuality. Graphic artist Heather Gibson attributed the [...] "sexism" [...] to participation from Eidos's marketing department.|$|E
