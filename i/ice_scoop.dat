25|$|An <b>ice</b> cream <b>scoop</b> is any {{specialized}} spoon used to {{dish and}} serve ice cream. Most <b>ice</b> cream <b>scoops</b> are hemispherical-shaped and contain a mechanical device {{to force the}} ice cream out of the <b>scoop.</b> The <b>ice</b> cream <b>scoop</b> was invented by African-American Alfred L. Cralle who was issued U.S. patent #576,395 on February 2, 1897.|$|R

5000|$|In kitchenware, certain <b>ice</b> cream <b>scoops</b> {{are called}} spades {{due to the}} shape. These scoops are used more in making hand-scooped milkshakes or desserts {{where a lot of}} ice cream can be scooped at once and the typical [...] "ball" [...] shape of <b>scooped</b> <b>ice</b> cream (i.e., <b>scoops</b> on a cone) is not needed. The spade-shaped head also helps scrape off the ice cream stuck to the sides of the cartons.|$|R
50|$|Some higher-end <b>ice</b> cream <b>scoops</b> have a {{thermally}} conductive liquid in the handle {{to help keep}} the ice cream from freezing to the scoop's metal.|$|R

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} ergonomics {{evaluation of}} retail ice cream shop operations was performed. Although the analysis was initiated by interest {{in examining the}} ergonomics of <b>scooping</b> <b>ice</b> cream, a broad systems-based analysis of shop operations was recommended so that the overall health, safety and productivity of employees could be enhanced. The analyses performed included manual materials handling analysis (using psychophysical data), passive and active surveillance, quantification of forces required to <b>scoop</b> <b>ice</b> cream, and anthropometry and workplace design assessments. Walk-through hazard identification, informal employee interviews and industry-wide passive surveillance provided direction for the selection of analyses. Both laboratory and field data collection were conducted. The primary ergonomic deficiencies uncovered included poor postures and high muscular forces associated with <b>scooping</b> <b>ice</b> cream. Recommendations were made {{in each of these}} areas. {{as well as in the}} area of work nractices, workplace design, and manual materials handhng. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Ice</b> cream <b>scoop</b> test: a novel {{clinical}} test to diagnose extensor carpi ulnaris instability Dear Sir, The extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) tendon is enclosed {{within its own}} sheath, which stabilizes the tendon within a groove along the distal ulna and is distinct from the extensor retinaculum (Spinner and Kaplan, 1970). Forceful wrist supination, flexion and ulnar deviation may result in attenuation or rupture of the ECU sheath, leading to subluxation or dislocation of the tendon out of its groove, typi-cally in a palmar and ulnar direction (Burkhart et al., 1982, Inoue and Tamura, 1998). Clinically, patients may present with a painful snapping or clicking sensation over the dorsoulnar wrist during forearm rotation. We describe a novel {{clinical test}} to aid diagnosis of the condition by asking the patient to simulate the action of <b>scooping</b> <b>ice</b> cream using his/her hand. This manoeuvre is then repeated against resistance and direct palpation of the tendon by the examiner (Figure 1). The wrist is first positioned in full prona-tion, ulnar deviation and extension, and then as the <b>ice</b> cream is <b>scooped,</b> the wrist is slowly moved into full supination while maintaining ulnar deviation against resistance from the examiner’s other hand. The test is considered positive if there is visible, audible or palpable snapping of the ECU tendon over the distal ulna and concurrent reproduction of the patient’s symptoms. Compared to simple forearm rotation, the <b>ice</b> cream <b>scoop</b> test accentuates subluxation of the ECU tendon, if present, and may allow identifica-tion of a more subtle form of instability. It is easy for the patient to comprehend and simple to perform...|$|R
50|$|Dishers {{are usually}} {{hemispherical}} like an <b>ice</b> cream <b>scoop,</b> while measuring scoops are usually cylindrical, and transfer scoops are usually shovel-shaped. Some dishers have mechanical levers which help expel the disher's contents. Traditionally dishers are sized {{by the number}} of scoops per quart but may also be sized by ounces, the diameter of the bowl, or the number of tablespoons they hold.|$|R

5000|$|Many {{employees}} of Amy's will do [...] "tricks" [...] with {{the ice cream}} as they prepare it and before the customer receives it. These tricks include, {{but are not limited}} to, throwing <b>ice</b> cream <b>scoops</b> under the leg, behind the back, and over people. Some locations are known for throwing ice cream across the street, where either the recipient or another employee will attempt to catch it.|$|R
5000|$|Oliebollen are {{a variety}} of {{dumpling}} made by using an <b>ice</b> cream <b>scoop</b> or two spoons to scoop a certain amount of dough and dropping the dough into a deep fryer filled with hot oil. In this way, a sphere-shaped oliebol emerges. Oliebollen are traditionally eaten on New Year's Eve and at funfairs. In wintertime, they are also sold in the street at mobile stalls.|$|R
40|$|Exhibition held at Australian History Museum, Macquarie University, Sydney, commencing on 7 December 2006 This {{exhibition}} display utilises cafe objects - such as milkshake makers, tableware, menus, cafe signage, <b>ice</b> cream <b>scoops,</b> <b>ice</b> cream sundae dishes, chocolate {{boxes and}} soda fountain glasses and bottles - together with {{historical and contemporary}} photographs. A five minute DVD presentation highlights {{the evolution of the}} Greek-run oyster saloons to soda/sundae 'parlors', milk bars, the classic country Greek cafe and finally the take-away. Objects and explanatory text are structured according to this sequential development. The process of the Americanisation of Australian eating and socio-cultural habits through these Greek-run enterprises is highlighted, including their working relationship with cinema and popular music. Greek cafe influences upon the development of Art Deco architectural style is also touched upon...|$|R
5000|$|Many {{rocks at}} Utopia Planitia appear perched, as if wind removed {{much of the}} soil at their bases. A hard surface crust is formed by {{solutions}} of minerals moving up through soil and evaporating at the surface.

50|$|GameRoom Magazine is an American {{magazine}} {{focusing on}} game room products (pinball, arcade games, jukeboxes, etc.). It {{was founded in}} 1988 by Dave C. and Donna Cooper of New Albany, Indiana, and was created to serve the growing market of coin-op memorabilia collectors, hobbyists, and restorers. The first issue, dated January 1989, focused on jukeboxes. The magazine also covered other coin-operated playthings, such as pinball machines, slot machines, and gumball machines, in addition to related items such as carousels, gas station memorabilia, and antique <b>ice</b> cream <b>scoops.</b>|$|R
50|$|Iced lemon tea is {{available}} at many Hong Kong restaurants. A strong black tea (e.g. Ceylon) is brewed at length in a metal pot over a burner, and prepared as follows: a large glass is filled with <b>ice,</b> a <b>scoop</b> of simple syrup is added (if desired), and the glass is filled to the top with hot tea. Slices of lemon are placed atop the mixture, which are then muddled into the tea by the customer, ensuring that the volatile oils present in the lemon peel are at their peak when consumed.|$|R
50|$|In the {{technical}} terms {{used by the}} food service industry and in the retail and wholesale food utensil industries, {{there is a clear}} distinction between three types of scoop: the disher, which is used to measure a portion e.g. cookie dough, to make melon balls, and often to serve ice cream (although manufacturers frequently advise against using dishers for ice cream and other frozen foods); <b>ice</b> cream <b>scoops,</b> and the scoop which is used to measure or to transfer an unspecified amount of a bulk dry foodstuff such as rice, flour, or sugar.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the major}} clients for DAM was HyperCard, Apple's data manager/rapid {{application}} development system. Combining HyperCard's excellent forms system with data from DAM resulted in something that no-one had ever seen before data-driven GUI apps. The most common demo of the system showed a HyperCard stack querying a series of Baskin-Robbins databases, formerly impossible because each regional area used their own database servers which DAL now combined into one. Reorders for stock could be made by dragging a series of <b>ice</b> cream <b>scoops</b> on a graphical display of the current warehoused inventory.|$|R

25|$|Reliable {{evidence}} {{proves that}} ice cream cones were {{served in the}} 19th century, and their popularity increased greatly during the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904. According to legend, at the World's Fair an ice cream seller {{had run out of}} the cardboard dishes used to put <b>ice</b> cream <b>scoops</b> in, so they could not sell any more produce. Next door to the ice cream booth was a Syrian waffle booth, unsuccessful due to intense heat; the waffle maker offered to make cones by rolling up his waffles and the new product sold well, and was widely copied by other vendors.|$|R

5000|$|After College Miller {{was unable}} to find work in journalism. Instead he moved through several occupations {{including}} a clerk at Giant Eagle deli, a janitor, a delivery man for a florist, and Ice Cream scooper at the Village Dairy. Reflecting on his pre-comedy job history in a later discussion with Tom Snyder, Miller recalled leaving college and attending a real estate seminar at a [...] "bad hotel" [...] which consisted of a five-hour lecture without bathroom breaks. Near the end of the lecture, he was told that he would only be paid by commission, which made Miller [...] "I'm in Hell, I don't even know what I am going to do for a living here. I'm a nut case." [...] Miller then worked as a delivery man for what he describes as [...] "an all-gay florist". Leaving that job he worked as an <b>Ice</b> Cream <b>scoop.</b> Miller recalled that was twenty-one - five years out of high school and was wearing a paper hat while working alongside teens excited about getting their driver's licences. A spur to quit the <b>Ice</b> Cream <b>scoop</b> job was when the prettiest girl he had attended high school with came in and {{he was the one who}} had to take her order, which filled him with embarrassment. Miller later stated that at the time he feared that if he stayed in such jobs his life would become a Franz Kafka novella, and it stiffened his resolve to start pursuing a comedy career.|$|R
40|$|The use of copper, a metal {{with high}} thermal conductivity, {{presents}} a technical improvement to Sherman L. Kelly's famous aluminium <b>ice</b> cream <b>scoop</b> from 1935. However, {{due to the}} difficulty of casting pure copper by the lost-wax method, the scoop comes out of the mould damaged and imperfect. Keulemans restores the scoop to functional use with tin and resin. The use of copper and tin together, in particular, recalls their ancient marriage in the form of bronze.

50|$|Mike was painfully shy until is mother coaxed {{him out of}} his shell with an <b>ice</b> cream <b>scoop.</b> Handing Mike the utensil as {{she cooked}} supper, she told Mike to pretend it was a {{microphone}} and entertain her. He did. For hours that night—and for countless nights, thereafter—Mike performed silly songs and poems to his mother. It's safe to say that Mike came out of his shell, and decades later it’s difficult to imagine Mike as anything but a performer. But he claims that that shy little boy still lives inside, which helps him to relate to children—shy ones, as well as not-so-shy ones—better.|$|R
