40|$|The {{present study}} {{considers}} {{the treatment of}} failed States in international law. State failure represents a relatively recent phenomenon, which presents novel problems {{for the international community}} to deal with. For international law, the principles and experience of dealing with the creation, continuity and <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> <b>States</b> present the nearest analogies, and so will form the basis of its responses to failure. Failure is defined as governmental and societal collapse in a State, so severe as to render it incapable of exercising internal and external sovereignty. It is likely to take the form of either conflictual implosion - such as in Somalia; or fragmentary explosion - as in Yugoslav ia. Accordingly, an examination of the treatment of these two failed States, during the early 1990 s, provides the substantive basis of the study. The key aspects of Statehood under which the study proceeds are: loss of government as a criterion of Statehood; self-determination, including the emerging right of democratic governance; and recognition. Consideration of the Somali and Yugoslav experiences of failure, and their treatment under the three areas identified, evidences a strong inertia in the international system against findings of State failure - the Somali experience. The only exception is if such a finding is coupled with a potential solution, such as the possible emergence of new States - the Yugoslav experience. The determinations constitute a meta-legal process, which can be seen as indicative of a new conception of 'political international law'...|$|E

500|$|The bulk <b>of</b> {{the larger}} <b>states,</b> and some groups <b>of</b> small <b>states,</b> were {{integrated}} through a different, four-step process.

40|$|Psychological {{factors such}} as pain catastrophizing and pain-related fear have been {{discussed}} as possible risk factors implemented {{in the development and}} exacerbation of disorders including pain in multiple body sites. Pain catastrophizing has been associated with central sensitization, and dysfunction of descending noxious inhibitory control, both of which have also been discussed as processes underlying the pathogenesis of multisite pain. The ‘generalization’ of fear and pain has been suggested as a mechanism by which pain-related fear might contribute to the spreading of pain. Study 1 revealed that pain catastrophizing and pain-related fear predict the number of pain sites reported following experimentally-induced delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). In study 2 we showed that the experience of pain in response to a non-noxious stimulus is predicted by pain-related fear and catastrophizing only after musculoskeletal injury has been induced in a distal site on the body. The following study (3) examined the susceptibility of pain catastrophizing and pain-related fear to the restriction of cognitive resources in their influence on the pain response to a non-noxious stimulus. The influence of pain catastrophizing on the intensification of pain in response to a non-noxious stimulus could not be replicated under neither low nor high cognitive load, while the influence of pain-related fear was affected only by a high cognitively demanding concurrent task. Furthermore, study 3 revealed that changes in the intensity of the pain response to a non-noxious stimulus were partially mediated by changes in <b>state</b> fear <b>of</b> movement-related pain. In the last study (4) we used a proprioceptive fear conditioning paradigm to examine the influence of pain catastrophizing, pain-related fear, and executive function capacity on the generalization and <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> <b>state</b> fear <b>of</b> movement-related pain. The results showed that low inhibitory capacity, as well as low levels of pain catastrophizing and pain-related fear were associated with slower rates of fear and pain expectancy extinction. Furthermore, pain catastrophizing was associated with the strength of the generalization <b>of</b> <b>state</b> fear <b>of</b> movement-related pain. The series of studies presented in this dissertation suggest that pain catastrophizing and pain- related fear prospectively predict the anatomical spreading of pain and the intensification of the pain response to a non-noxious stimulus. Furthermore, the augmenting influence of pain-related fear can be attenuated by restricting the amount of cognitive resources available. The results indicate that the generalization of fear is a potential vehicle through which pain catastrophizing and pain-related fear influence the pain response to a non-noxious stimulus. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{psychological}} dynamics {{is governed}} by the ”observable-unobservable ” systemic ratio. The plausible existence {{of the dynamics of}} the psychological laws is justified by the presence of a complex psycho-physiological apparatus which changes the informational biofeedback into energy. The psychological insight represented by the (unobservable) psychological soft component obeys the functional models [6] which define the psychological sys-tem. The psychological Gordian knot consists in identifying {{the manner in which the}} unobservable psychological fact changes into physiology and vice versa. The psychological literature is well represented, especially by the behavior models of the physiological hard component [1], [7], [17], [18]. This paper tries to develop a mathemat-ical theory of psychological insight. The purpose is to create an unifying theory between the functionality of the psychological soft and of the physiological hard – having, from our point of view, the capacity to solve the Gordian knot – based on the results of this paper.

5000|$|The {{invasion}} of Poland on 1 September 1939, started {{the war in}} Europe, and the United Kingdom and France declared war on Germany on 3 September. Poland fielded the third biggest army among the European Allies, after the Soviet Union and United Kingdom, but before France. The country never officially surrendered to the Third Reich, nor to the Soviet Union, primarily because neither of the totalitarian powers requested an official surrender, and continued the war effort under the Polish government in exile. However, the Soviet Union unilaterally considered the flight to Romania of President Ignacy Mościcki and Marshal Edward Rydz-Śmigły on 17 September as an evidence of debellatio causing the <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> Polish <b>State,</b> and consequently declared itself allowed to invade (according to Soviet position: [...] "to protect") Eastern Poland starting from the same day.

The Soviets invaded on 17 September at 3 a.m., l [...] while president Mościcki crossed the Polish-Romanian border at 21:45 on the same day.

50|$|Since April 30, the US State Department {{had been}} {{actively}} pressurising all neutral countries that had retained {{diplomatic relations with}} Germany to prepare to close down German embassies and hand over their archives and records to the embassies of the Western Allies; and some had done so even before May 8. However, as the military capitulation of the German High Command was taken as constituting the <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> the German <b>state</b> and the assumption <b>of</b> all <b>state</b> authority by the Allied Powers, all embassies remaining in neutral countries were immediately ordered by the Western Allies to be closed down, their diplomatic staff recalled and their records taken over into one or another Allied embassy. Those neutral countries that had been nominated as protecting powers in respect of Germany and the Allies under the Geneva Conventions were notified that this function had now been terminated, and were requested by the State Department to hand all embassy records and German state property in their trust over to the western Allies. All the protecting powers complied fully with the Allied demands, formally breaking off diplomatic relations; consequently the German state ceased as a diplomatic entity on 8 May 1945.|$|R
50|$|On December 12, 1941 - {{following}} Germany's {{declaration of}} war against the United States - Switzerland {{assumed the role of}} protecting power of Germany in the United States and took custody of the chancery of the German embassy; staff were, meanwhile, interned at the Greenbrier until an exchange of diplomats was arranged the following year. During World War II, Switzerland used parts of the chancery to house its own staff, thereby alleviating a housing shortage for Swiss diplomatic personnel in the United States. Following the German military surrender in May 1945, Switzerland acknowledged the <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> the German <b>state</b> and declared itself absolved of protecting responsibilities. The chancery of the embassy was surrendered, by Switzerland, to the United States government as trustee of the Allied Control Council that month. Upon receiving custody of the building, the United States government removed all documents and files that had been left behind by the German delegation and held them until 1950, at which point they were returned to the reconstituted German government.|$|R
