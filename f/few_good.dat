For writing The Social Network, {{he won the}} Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay, among other awards. He made his feature directorial debut in 2017 with Molly's Game, which he also wrote.|$|E
5|$|In March 2016, it was {{announced}} that Sorkin would be adapting A <b>Few</b> <b>Good</b> Men for a live production on NBC, slated to air in 2018.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Sorkin revised {{his play}} A <b>Few</b> <b>Good</b> Men for a revival at the London West End theatre, the Haymarket. The play {{opened at the}} Theatre Royal Haymarket {{in the fall of}} the same year and was {{directed}} by David Esbjornson, with Rob Lowe of The West Wing in the lead role.|$|E

5|$|Sorkin got the {{inspiration}} {{to write his}} next play, a courtroom drama called A <b>Few</b> <b>Good</b> Men, from a phone conversation with his sister Deborah (who had graduated from Boston University Law School and {{signed up for a}} three-year stint with the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps). Deborah told Sorkin {{that she was going to}} Guantanamo Bay to defend a group of Marines who came close to killing a fellow Marine in a hazing ordered by a superior officer. Sorkin took that information and wrote much of his story on cocktail napkins while bartending at the Palace Theatre. He and his roommates had purchased a Macintosh 512K so when he returned home he would empty his pockets of the cocktail napkins and type them into the computer, forming a basis from which he wrote many drafts for A <b>Few</b> <b>Good</b> Men.|$|E
5|$|Sorkin wrote several {{drafts of}} the script for A <b>Few</b> <b>Good</b> Men in his Manhattan apartment, {{learning}} the craft from a book about screenplay format. He then spent several months at the Los Angeles offices of Castle Rock, working on the script with director Rob Reiner. William Goldman (who regularly worked under contract at Castle Rock) became his mentor and helped him to adapt his stageplay into a screenplay. The movie was directed by Reiner, starred Tom Cruise, Jack Nicholson, Demi Moore and Kevin Bacon, and was produced by Brown. A <b>Few</b> <b>Good</b> Men was released in 1992 and was a box office success.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the {{nominations}} announcement on February 17, the combined gross of the five Best Picture nominees at the US box office was $252 million, with an average of $50.4 million per film. A <b>Few</b> <b>Good</b> Men was the highest earner among the Best Picture nominees with $120 million in domestic box office receipts. The film was followed by Unforgiven ($75.2 million), Scent of a Woman ($34.1 million), The Crying Game ($14 million), and finally Howards End ($8.7 million).|$|E

5|$|Barrowman {{returned}} {{to the role of}} Billy Crocker in Trevor Nunn's 2003 West End revival of Anything Goes, and appeared in West End non-musical dramas, such as his role as Wyndham Brandon in Rope at the Minerva Theatre, Chichester in 1993, and he starred as Lieutenant Jack Ross opposite Rob Lowe in the 2005 production of A <b>Few</b> <b>Good</b> Men.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Sorkin worked under {{contract}} for Castle Rock Entertainment, Inc. He wrote the scripts for A <b>Few</b> <b>Good</b> Men, Malice and The American President: The three films grossed about US$400million worldwide. While writing for Castle Rock he {{became friends with}} colleagues such as William Goldman and Rob Reiner and met his future wife Julia Bingham, {{who was one of}} Castle Rock's business affairs lawyers.|$|E
5|$|Of the top 50 {{grossing}} {{movies of}} the year, 38 nominations went to 13 films on the list. Only A <b>Few</b> <b>Good</b> Men (6th), Unforgiven (17th), Malcolm X (30th) and Scent of a Woman (38th) were nominated for directing, acting, screenwriting, or Best Picture. The other top 50 box office hits that earned nominations were Aladdin (1st), Batman Returns (3rd), Basic Instinct (8th), The Bodyguard (9th), Under Siege (12th), Bram Stoker's Dracula (14th), The Last of the Mohicans (16th), Death Becomes Her (22nd), and AlienÂ³ (26th).|$|E

5|$|Sorkin {{continued}} writing Making Movies and in 1990 it debuted Off-Broadway at the Promenade Theatre, {{produced by}} John A. McQuiggan, and again directed by Don Scardino. Meanwhile, David Brown was producing a few projects at TriStar Pictures {{and tried to}} interest them in making A <b>Few</b> <b>Good</b> Men into a film but his proposal was declined {{due to the lack}} of star actor involvement. Brown later got a call from Alan Horn at Castle Rock Entertainment who was anxious to make the film. Rob Reiner, a Castle Rock producing partner, opted to direct it.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Dalton felt {{jealous of}} boys {{for the freedom}} they enjoyed. They could travel alone without {{worrying}} about their reputation and were often bribed to attend school, while girls were, in her opinion, educated reluctantly. One of her teachers {{thought it would be}} wasteful for her to study algebra, as she already had sufficient education for a housewife. As a young woman, she felt that women lived on a higher moral level than men. She saw polygamy as a way to allow more women to marry the <b>few</b> <b>good</b> men, arguing that it gave more women the opportunity to marry. She also considered it ironic that prostitution was tolerated but polygamy was considered depraved.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Demi Moore was {{a budding}} A-list film star {{who had been}} married to Bruce Willis since 1987. The couple had had their first child Rumer Willis in 1988, and they had hired three photographers for an {{audience}} of six friends for the delivery. In 1990, she had starred in that year's highest-grossing film, Ghost, for which she was paid $750,000, and she had earned $2.5 million for 1991 roles in The Butcher's Wife and Mortal Thoughts. Following the photo, she would earn $3 million for her 1992 role in A <b>Few</b> <b>Good</b> Men and $5 million apiece for roles in Indecent Proposal (1993), Disclosure (1994) and The Scarlet Letter (1995).|$|E

50|$|The government's {{primary source}} of income is {{indirect}} taxation: there is no income tax, capital gains tax, or corporation tax. An import duty of 5% to 22% (automobiles 29.5% to 100%) is levied against goods imported into the islands. <b>Few</b> <b>goods</b> are exempt; notable exemptions include books, cameras, and infant formula.|$|R
5|$|In the 18th century, Shakespeare became {{associated}} with rising British nationalism, and Boydell tapped {{into the same}} mood that many other entrepreneurs were exploiting. Shakespeare appealed not only to a social elite who prided themselves on their artistic taste, {{but also to the}} emerging middle class who saw in Shakespeare's works a vision of a diversified society. The mid-century Shakespearean theatrical revival was probably most responsible for reintroducing the British public to Shakespeare. Shakespeare's plays were integral to the theatre's resurgence at this time. Despite the upsurge in theatre-going, writing tragedies was not profitable, and thus <b>few</b> <b>good</b> tragedies were written. Shakespeare's works filled the gap in the repertoire, and his reputation grew as a result. By the end of the 18th century, one out of every six plays performed in London was by Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|The Browns {{won every}} {{game in the}} 1948 season, a feat that went {{unmatched}} until the Miami Dolphins (coached by Brown disciple Don Shula) did it in 1972. Cleveland then won the AAFC championship {{for the fourth time}} in a row in 1949. By then, however, the league was struggling for survival, {{due in part to the}} Browns' dominance. Attendance at games dwindled in 1948 and 1949 as fans lost interest in lopsided victories, and at the end of the 1949 season the AAFC dissolved. Three of its teams, the San Francisco 49ers, the Baltimore Colts and the Browns, merged into the NFL. The Browns picked up a <b>few</b> <b>good</b> former AAFC players from other teams, including offensive guard Abe Gibron and defensive end Len Ford, but some observers saw Brown's team as the lone standout in an otherwise minor league.|$|E
5|$|After {{mismanagement}} {{during the}} late 1980s, Hibs were {{on the brink of}} financial ruin in 1990. Wallace Mercer, the chairman of Hearts, proposed a merger of the two clubs, but the Hibs fans believed that the proposal was more like a hostile takeover. They formed the Hands off Hibs group to campaign for the continued existence of the club. This succeeded when a prominent local businessman, Kwik-Fit owner Sir Tom Farmer, acquired a controlling interest in Hibs. The fans were able to persuade Farmer to take control {{despite the fact that he}} had no great interest in football. Farmer was persuaded in part by the fact that a relative of his had been involved in the rescue of Hibs from financial ruin in the early 1890s. After the attempted takeover by Mercer, Hibs had a <b>few</b> <b>good</b> years in the early 1990s, winning the 1991 Scottish League Cup Final and finishing in the top five in the league in 1993, 1994 and 1995. Soon after Alex McLeish was appointed as manager in 1998, Hibs were relegated to the First Division, but immediately won promotion back to the SPL in 1999.|$|E
50|$|<b>Few</b> <b>goods</b> in {{the real}} world will behave as perfect complements. One example is a left shoe and a right; shoes are {{naturally}} sold in pairs, and the ratio between sales of left and right shoes will never shift noticeably from 1:1, even if, for example, someone is missing a leg and buys just one shoe.|$|R
50|$|As long as {{the price}} {{elasticity}} of demand for most customers is less than one in absolute value, it is advantageous for a company to increase its prices: it receives more money for <b>fewer</b> <b>goods.</b> With a price increase, price elasticity tends to increase, and in the optimum case above it will be greater than one for most customers.|$|R

50|$|Specie {{flowed through}} Spain {{increasing}} Spanish prices and then spread over Western Europe {{as a result}} of Spanish balance of payments deficit.
