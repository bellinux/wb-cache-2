Proton conductance in mitochondria from Ucp 3 knockout mice was inhibited strongly by carboxyatractylate, bongkrekate and partially by GDP. We conclude the following. (1) at high protonmotive force, an endogenously-generated activator stimulates proton conductance catalysed partly by UCP 3 and partly by the adenine nucleotide translocase. (2) GDP is not a specific inhibitor of UCP 3, but also inhibits proton translocation by the adenine nucleotide translocase.

We delivered dCas 9 -P 65 HSF 1 mRNA, MS 2 -P 65 HSF 1 mRNA and unmodified or CT modified sgRNAs with different structures: OCT 4 Tetra or 2 ×MS 2 sgRNA pool simultaneously into primary CD 3 + T cells. Schematic structures of these two complexes were shown in Fig.  2 E. Unmodified OCT 4 Tetra and 2 ×MS 2 sgRNA pools did not activate endogenous OCT 4 efficiently. Remarkably, both activated OCT 4 expression up to 60 -fold after CT modification (Fig.  2 F). To further improve the <b>endogenous</b> gene <b>activation</b> in human primary T cells, we optimized the proportion of different components. DCas 9 -P 65 HSF 1 mRNA, MS 2 -P 65 mRNA and CT modified Tetra sgRNA pool at the ratio of 1 : 1 : 2 led to the best activation efficiency in CD 3 + T cells (Fig. S 6 A).

Supplementation of taurine could prevent the development of DOCA-salt hypertension in rats, but failed to change blood pressure in vehicle-treated control rats. Cardiac NE turnover, which was determined from the rate of decline of tissue NE concentration after the administration of alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, was markedly accelerated in DOCA-salt rats, but 1 % taurine supplement restored it to normal. Moreover, naloxone (2 mg/kg), the specific opiate antagonist, increased blood pressure in taurine-treated DOCA-salt rats, restoring it to levels {{similar to those in}} the DOCA-salt rats. In contrast, taurine did not decrease cardiac NE turnover in the control rats, nor did naloxone increase blood pressure in the taurine-treated control rats. Moreover, supplementation of taurine increased both beta-endorphin-like immunoreactive material and taurine contents in the hypothalamus of DOCA-salt rats, whereas it did not increase beta-endorphin in that of control rats despite increased taurine contents. Thus, taurine not only normalized the increased cardiac SNS activity but also elicited an opiate-mediated vasodepressor response only in DOCA-salt rats. It is suggested, therefore, that <b>endogenous</b> opiate <b>activation,</b> which is intimately related to SNS suppression, may contribute to the antihypertensive effect of taurine in sodium chloride hypertension...|$|R

Neither activity had a cationic requirement, but both were inhibited by Cu 2 +. Some properties differed.

40|$|The aryl {{hydrocarbon}} receptor (AhR) is traditionally defined as a transcription factor activated by exogenous polyaromatic and halogenated aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH/HAH) ligands. Active AhR induces genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism, including cytochrome P 4501 A 1, which function to metabolize activating ligands. However, recent studies implicate AhR in biological events that are apparently unrelated to the xenobiotic response, implying that <b>endogenous</b> <b>activation</b> mechanisms exist. Three AhR genes in zebrafish (Danio rerio) encode proteins that demonstrate differential activation in response to PAH/HAHs, with the nonresponsive drAhR 1 a having some sequence divergence from the PAH/HAH-responsive AhRs in the ligand binding domain (LBD). We used these differences to guide the mutagenesis of mouse AhR (mAhR), aiming to generate variants that functionally discriminate between activation mechanisms. We found substitution of histidine 285 in the LBD with tyrosine gave a receptor that could be activated by isopropyl- 2 -(1, 3 -dithietane- 2 -ylidene) - 2 -[N-(4 -methylthiazol- 2 -yl) carbamoyl]acetate (YH 439), a potential AhR ligand chemically distinct from classic PAH/HAH-type ligands, but prevented activation by both exogenous PAH/HAH ligands and the <b>endogenous</b> <b>activation</b> mimics of suspension culture and application of shear-stressed serum. The differential response of H 285 Y mAhR to YH 439 suggests that this activator has a novel mode of interaction that tolerates tyrosine at position 285 in the LBD and is distinct from the binding mode of the well characterized PAH/HAH ligands. In support of this, the PAH-type antagonist 3 ′, 4 ′-dimethoxyflavone blocked mAhR activation by 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin but not YH 439. Furthermore, the strict correlation between response to exogenous PAH/HAH ligands and mimics of <b>endogenous</b> <b>activation</b> suggests that a PAH-type ligand may underpin endogenous mechanisms of activation.

All three disinfectants are weakly genotoxic in human leukocytes (lowest effective dose 0. 2 p. p. m. for chlorine dioxide, 0. 5 p. p. m. for sodium hypochlorite and peracetic acid). The results in S. cerevisiae show a genotoxic response on the end-points considered with an effect only at doses higher (5 - to 10 -fold) than the concentration normally used for water disin-fection; sodium hypochlorite and peracetic acid are able to induce genotoxic effects without <b>endogenous</b> metabolic <b>activation</b> (in stationary phase cells) whereas chlorine dioxide is effective in growing cells.

40|$|Neural {{progenitor}} cells (NPCs) {{are found}} in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the adult brain, a specialized neurogenic niche that might provide a substrate for brain repair after injury. The incomplete knowledge of how NPCs in the niche respond to local signals limits the use of cultured NPCs in the development of cell transplantation strategies. We show that neurospheres obtained from the SVZ of the adult mouse expressed functional mGlu 1 and mGlu 5 metabotropic glutamate receptors. Pharmacological blockade of mGlu 5 receptors promoted the apoptotic death of progenitors undergoing differentiation into neurons (PSA/NCAM(+) cells for the most part), whereas blockade of mGlu 1 receptors reduced the proliferation rate of NPCs, and promoted their differentiation towards the neuronal lineage. We conclude that <b>endogenous</b> <b>activation</b> of mGlu 5 receptors might support specifically the survival of neuronal-restricted precursors, whereas <b>endogenous</b> <b>activation</b> of mGlu 1 receptors might sustain the proliferation of earlier progenitors. Moreover, mGlu 1 receptor antagonists increased the survival of NPCs, suggesting that endogenously activated mGlu 1 receptors might {{play a role in the}} natural cell loss regulating the number or the type of progenitors.

40|$|Postoperative ileus is {{encountered}} by patients undergoing open abdominal surgery and {{is characterized by}} intestinal inflammation associated with impaired gastrointestinal motility. We recently showed that inflammation of the gut muscularis triggered activation of the vagal efferent pathway mainly targeting the inflamed zone. In the present study we investigate further the modulatory role of <b>endogenous</b> <b>activation</b> of the vagal motor pathway on the innate immune response. Intestinal or splenic denervation was performed two weeks prior to intestinal manipulation (IM) or laparotomy (L). Twenty-four hour post-surgery, the gastrointestinal transit, immune cell influx, and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels were measured in the gut muscularis. Manipulation of the small intestine led to a delay in intestinal transit, an influx of leukocytes and increased pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Surgical lesion of the vagal branch that selectively innervates the small intestine did not further delay the intestinal transit but significantly enhanced the expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL- 1 β and IL- 6 in the gut muscularis. Splenic denervation did not affect intestinal inflammation or gastrointestinal transit after intestinal manipulation. Our study demonstrates that selective vagotomy, leaving the splenic innervation intact, increases surgery-induced intestinal inflammation.

Here, we examined the interaction between LIF and mGlu 5 receptors using as a read-out the immediate early gene, c-Myc. The selective mGlu 5 receptor antagonist, 2 -methyl- 6 -(phenylenthynyl) pyridine (MPEP; 1 mu M), reduced the increase in c-Myc protein levels induced by LIF by enhancing c-Myc ubiquitination. A reduction in c-Myc levels was also observed following small interfering RNA-mediated mGlu 5 receptor gene silencing. MPEP reduced glycogen synthase kinase- 3 beta phosphorylation on Ser 9, but increased phosphorylation of the phosphatidylinositol- 3 -kinase (PI- 3 -K) substrate, AKT. In our hands, activated PI- 3 -K reduced the stability of c-Myc, because (i) the PI- 3 -K inhibitor, LY 294002, prevented the reduction in c-Myc levels induced by MPEP; and (ii) over-expression of AKT promoted c-Myc ubiquitination. All effects of MPEP were mimicked by protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors and reversed by the PKC activator, tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate. We conclude that <b>endogenous</b> <b>activation</b> of mGlu 5 receptors sustains the increase in c-Myc induced by LIF in embryonic stem cells by inhibiting both glycogen synthase kinase- 3 beta and PI- 3 -K, both effects resulting from the activation of PKC...|$|E

More importantly, we demonstrate that in vivo selective activation of cholinergic interneurons is sufficient to elicit dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. Therefore, the control of accumbal extracellular dopamine levels by endogenous cholinergic activity results from a complex convergence of neurotransmitter/neuromodulator systems that may ultimately synergize to drive motivated behavior...|$|R

However, {{it remains to be}} elucidated whether the long-term changes produced by endogenous adenosine in the efficiency of synapses are related to those required for learning and memory formation. Our goal was to understand how <b>endogenous</b> <b>activation</b> of adenosine excitatory A 2 A receptors modulates the associative learning evolution in conscious behaving mice. We have studied here the effects of the application of a highly selective A 2 A receptor antagonist, SCH 58261, upon a well-known associative learning paradigmFclassical eyeblink conditioning. We used a trace paradigm, with a tone as the conditioned stimulus (CS) and an electric shock presented to the supraorbital nerve as the unconditioned stimulus (US). A single electrical pulse was presented to the Schaffer collateral–commissural pathway to evoke field EPSPs (fEPSPs) in the pyramidal CA 1 area during the CS–US interval. In vehicle-injected animals, there was a progressive increase in the percentage of conditioning responses (CRs) and in the slope of fEPSPs through conditioning sessions, an effect that was completely prevented (and lost) in SCH 58261 (0. 5 mg/kg, i. p.) -injected animals. Moreover, experimentally evoked LTP was impaired in SCH 58261 -injected mice. In conclusion, the <b>endogenous</b> <b>activation</b> of adenosine A 2 A receptors plays a pivotal effect on the associative learning process and its relevant hippocampal circuits, including activity-dependent changes at the CA 3 -CA 1 synapse...|$|E
40|$|Cannabinoid {{receptor}} 1 (CB 1 R) {{is widely}} {{distributed in the}} central nervous system, in excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and in astrocytes. CB 1 R agonists impair cognition and prevent long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission, but the influence of endogenously formed cannabinoids (eCBs) on hippocampal LTP remains ambiguous. Based on the knowledge that eCBs are released upon high frequency neuronal firing, we hypothesized that the influence of eCBs upon LTP could change according to the paradigm of LTP induction. We thus tested the influence of eCBs on hippocampal LTP using two θ-burst protocols that induce either a weak or a strong LTP. LTP induced by a weak-θ-burst protocol is facilitated while preventing the <b>endogenous</b> <b>activation</b> of CB 1 Rs. In contrast, the same procedures lead to inhibition of LTP induced by the strong-θ-burst protocol, suggestive of a facilitatory action of eCBs upon strong LTP. Accordingly, an inhibitor of the metabolism of the predominant eCB in the hippocampus, 2 -arachidonoyl-glycerol (2 -AG), facilitates strong LTP. The facilitatory action of endogenous CB 1 R activation {{does not require the}} activity of inhibitory A 1 adenosine receptors, is not affected by inhibition of astrocytic metabolism, but involves inhibitory GABAergic transmission. The continuous activation of CB 1 Rs via exogenous cannabinoids, or by drugs known to prevent metabolism of the non-prevalent hippocampal eCB, anandamide, inhibited LTP. We conclude that <b>endogenous</b> <b>activation</b> of CB 1 Rs by physiologically formed eCBs exerts a fine-tune homeostatic control of LTP in the hippocampus, acting as a high-pass filter, therefore likely reducing the signal-to-noise ratio of synaptic strengthening...|$|E

In recent applications of this strategy, drug encapsulated carriers of 100 - 500 nm size (i. e., mesoporous silica, self-assembled molecular aggregates) containing a photoswitch for cargo release have been developed. ...|$|E
40|$|Protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) have a {{catalytic}} cysteine residue whose reduced {{state is}} integral to the reaction mechanism. Since exposure to air can artifactually oxidize this highly reactive thiol, PTPase assays have typically used potent reducing agents to reactivate the enzymes present; however, this approach {{does not allow for}} the measurement of the endogenous PTPase activity directly isolated from the in vivo cellular environment. Here we provide a method for using an anaerobic chamber to preserve the activity of the total PTPase complement in a tissue lysate or of an immunoprecipitated PTPase homolog to characterize their <b>endogenous</b> <b>activation</b> state. Comparison with a sample treated with biochemical reducing agents allows the determination of the activatable (reducible) fraction of the endogenous PTPase pool...|$|E
40|$|Ras-GTP imaging {{studies using}} the Ras-binding domain (RBD) of the Ras {{effector}} c-Raf {{as a reporter}} for overexpressed Ras have produced discrepant results about the possible activation of Ras at the Golgi apparatus. We report that RBD oligomerization provides probes for visualization of endogenous Ras-GTP, obviating Ras overexpression and the side effects derived thereof. RBD oligomerization results in tenacious binding to Ras-GTP and interruption of Ras signalling. Trimeric RBD probes fused to green fluorescent protein report agonist-induced <b>endogenous</b> Ras <b>activation</b> at the plasma membrane (PM) of COS- 7, PC 12 and Jurkat cells, but do not accumulate at the Golgi. PM illumination is exacerbated by Ras overexpression and its sensitivity to dominant-negative RasS 17 N and pharmacological manipulations matches Ras-GTP formation assessed biochemically. Our data illustrate that endogenous Golgi-located Ras is not under the control of growth factors and argue for the PM as the predominant site of agonist-induced Ras activation...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Regenerative surgery {{deals with}} damaged tissue via <b>endogenous</b> cell <b>activation</b> or through {{autologous}} cell implantation. Several clinical applications employing cell infusions, platelet gel (PG), or both, are currently applied in {{cases in which}} no other therapy is application. The vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) system is a non invasive device used {{in the management of}} complicated wounds, which creates sub-atmospheric pressure promoting the wound healing process. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We describe the case of a 75 -year-old woman who underwent several surgical interventions and presented a non-healing ileo-cutaneous fistula. All standard procedures in order to treat the trauma failed, so a treatment associating VAC and PG was performed. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: VAC and PG represent promising opportunities for the treatment of difficult wounds. In this case, the association of regenerative medicine using homologous PG to the VAC therapy was employed in order to enhance the effect of both techniques on tissue repair...|$|R
40|$|Choline {{deficiency}} enhances greatly the pancreatotoxicity of DL-ethionine. Mice fed DL-ethionine with a choline-deficient diet {{develop a}} fatal acute hemorrhagic pancreatic necrosis with fat necrosis (AHPN) in 5 days. Induction of the AHPN is completely prevented by dietary methionine and drastically reduced by dietary methionine and drastically reduced by dietary choline. The amount of proteins, carbohydrates, and {{fat in the}} diet influences its consumption by the animals and thus {{the severity of the}} pancreatic pathology. The histogenesis of the process is characterized by widespread alterations of the membranous organelles of the acinar cells, especially the endoplasmic reticulum and the zymogen granules. The onset of the hemorrhagic necrosis of the pancreas is due to an <b>endogenous</b> intraparenchymal <b>activation</b> of the zymogenic proteases, including proelastase. The new experimental model of AHPN appears to mimic very closely the clinical course, the anatomic pathologic lesions, and the postulated pathogenesis of the corresponding human disease...|$|R
