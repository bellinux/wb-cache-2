40|$|Aim. To {{evaluate}} {{the frequency of}} complications in bronchoscopy from data compiled between 1 / 2 / 2002 to 1 / 2 / 2003. Materials and methods. Nineteen Italian centres of thoracic endoscopy participated in the study, {{for a total of}} 20, 986 bronchoscopies (FBS), including 10, 658 explorative bronchoscopies (EB) (50. 79 %), 5, 520 bronchial biopsies (BB) (26. 30 %), 1, 660 transbronchial biopsies (TBB) (7. 91 %), 1, 127 broncho-alveolar lavages (BAL) (5. 37 %), 930 transbronchial needle-aspirates (TBNA) (4. 43 %), 1. 091 therapeutic bronchoscopies (TB), comprising ND-YAG Laser, argon-plasma, <b>electrocautery</b> <b>knife,</b> stent insertion (5. 20 %). 82. 4 % of the procedures involved the use of a flexible bronchoscope, 16. 3 % were carried out using a rigid bronchoscope and 1. 3 % using the mixed technique. Results. The total number of complications recorde...|$|E
40|$|Neovesical-urethral anastomotic {{stricture}} is a {{complication of}} orthotopic neobladder, with a reported incidence of 2. 7 % to 8. 8 %. Strictures of the neovesico-urethral anastomotic site {{can be treated}} with regular self-dilation, but high-grade strictures require a surgical procedure involving incision by <b>electrocautery</b> or cold <b>knife.</b> Here we describe a grade III neovesical-urethral anastomotic stricture after an orthotopic bladder substitution that was successfully treated by use of a ureteral dilation balloon catheter.

40|$|Background: Recent {{studies are}} testing the {{feasibility}} of an incisionless endoscopic per-oral approach to the peritoneal cavity in experimental animals. Herein we present our results of peroral peritoneoscopy, liver biopsy, cholecystectomy, fallopian tube and uterus excision, in a porcine model to determine the technical feasibility and safety of Peroral Transgastric Procedures. Methods: The procedures were performed on ten 28 - 50 Kgr anaesthetised pigs by using sterilized double channel endoscope and catheters. The gastric cavity was irrigated with antibiotic solution {{and access to the}} peritoneal cavity was gained after stomach wall incision with needle <b>knife</b> <b>electrocautery.</b> Peritoneoscopy (10 pigs), liver biopsy (1 pig), cholecystectomy (6 pigs) fallopian tube excision (one pig) and Hysterectomy (1 pig) were carried out. Four acute and six survival experiments were performed. Results: All procedures were accomplished successfully. Easily handled complications occurred in two animals. The feasibility of the peroral approach was demonstrated in all acute experiments. In the survival experiments all pigs recovered and thrived during the following four to six weeks. Conclusion: Evidence is given that per-oral transgastric surgery is technically feasible and safe in a porcine model. The method has potential to become an alternative to laparoscopy. Further evaluation in larger series is required...|$|R
