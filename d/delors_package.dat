40|$|When the Council of Lisbon of 1992 {{gave the}} go-ahead to the {{amplification}} of the European Union (EU), {{it did so}} {{on the condition of}} a prior advance in political integration and the endowment of the necessary financial resources which were specified in the Treaty of European Union and the <b>Delors</b> <b>Package.</b> The author explains how thefactor that the four candidates (which ended up with the adhesion of three of them) were adhered to the European Economic Space facilitated the driving of the negotiations on a fast track. Spain, which sheltered the fear that the admission of countries traditionally unwilling to accept the transfer of sovereignty would dilute those concepts of integration, assumed the need for adhesion of these high-income countries before facing the amplification of the EU towards eastern Europe. Given the relative ease with which the candidates accepted the assumption of community patrimony, the Spanish negotiating position centred itself in its refusal to allow an increase in the blocking minority in Council voting sessions, in the maintenance of the conditions in passing to the third phase ofthe Economic and Monetary Union, in the defense of fishing and agricultural interests, in avoiding that the figures dedicated to structural funds be reduced as well as ensuring the raising of environmental standards...|$|E
40|$|The author {{analyses}} {{the development}} of the European Union’s regional policy since 1988 and possible changes that could occur after the eastward enlargement. He examines Delors I and <b>Delors</b> II budgetary <b>packages,</b> covering the period 1988 - 2000, main principles and objectives, their changes over time and instruments of conducting the policy - Structural Funds. The author also analyses the preparations for enlargement within the scope of Agenda 2000 report, its contents, negotiation process for its adoption and changes made by it. At the end, he examines the effect that regional policy has made so far and possible obstacles for the forthcoming enlargement...|$|R
40|$|The European Union {{regarded}} as an economic reenhancement force in Europe {{and in the world}} must fund the needs of 500 million citizens. To do that, it should possess an innovative budget adjusted to the new facts of globalization meant to meet present challenges and create various opportunities for the future. In order to improve budgetary procedures, the need to reform the community bugdet has emerged, namely to change the way it is designed and spent. The manner of setting and distributing the community budget has been changed several times whenever the context in member states has demanded. Thus, European institutions concluded in 1988 interinstitutional agreements which have been covering budgetary process and budget allocation ever since. Agreements are concluded for several years and bear the name of “financial prospects”. Other two agreements have been made (during 2007 - 2013 and, respectively, 2014 - 2020) in compliance with Delors I and <b>Delors</b> II <b>Packages.</b> The present paper focuses on approaching the progress of budgetary indicators {{in the context of the}} multiannual financial framework where the European Union budget is set...|$|R
40|$|The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in the European Union (EU) {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} fields of {{cooperation}} within the European Union. During the past decades the different Commissioners have made several proposals about changes in the CAP and many of them have not been passed but renegotiated. The present Commission has however published a report in 2011, which emphasizes that the CAP has three alternative ways to go in the future. This study aims to predict which one of these three alternative ways it is most likely that the CAP will take according to the historical institutionalist theory. When to be able to predict this text analysis is used. The analysis tools of the study are collected from the theory, which focuses on the conceptions: critical juncture, feedback effects, path dependency and sequencing. These tools as well as the theory are applied on the empirical material, which mainly consists of books about the earlier reforms and proposals from the Commission, academical journals and some reports. The analysis shows that the Luxembourg compromise can be seen as a critical juncture in the history of the CAP and this led to a path dependency, which is characterized by a decision-making procedure by consensus between the political institutions in the EU. The analysis also shows that most of the reforms regarding the CAP, are made with some sort of compromise or consensus (the <b>Delors</b> I budgetary <b>package,</b> the Mac Sharry reforms and so on). Therefore the conclusion of the study is that, from an historical institutionalist perspective, it is more or less possible for the CAP to go with any of the alternative ways that the Commission points out in the report. It is however most likely that the second way is the most prominent one. This is because that option emphasizes that major overhauls of the policy should be made, that the measures should be more targeted, and that the spending of the CAP should be more efficient. All of these changes have been made more or less during the history of the CAP and the institutional framework therefore allows this way...|$|R
