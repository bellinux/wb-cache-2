40|$|Cultured human melanocytes differ tremendously {{in visual}} pigmentation, and recapitulate the {{pigmentary}} phenotype of the donor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>skin.</b> This diversity arises from variation in type {{as well as}} quantity of melanin produced. Here, we measured contents of eumelanin (EM) and pheomelanin (PM) in 60 primary human melanocyte cultures (51 neonatal and nine adults), and correlated some of these values with the respective activity and protein levels of tyrosinase, and the melanocortin- 1 receptor (MC 1 R) genotype. Melanocytes were classified into four phenotypes (L, L+, D, D+) as depicted by visual pigmentation using light microscopy, and by the pigmentary phenotype of the donor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>skin.</b> There were large differences in total melanin (TM) and EM, which increased progressively for L, L+, D and D+ melanocytes. TM content, the sum of EM and PM, showed a good correlation with TM measured spectrophotometrically, and with the activity and protein levels of tyrosinase. Log EM/PM ratio did not correlate with MC 1 R genotype. We conclude that: (i) EM consistently correlates with the visual phenotype; (ii) lighter melanocytes {{tend to be more}} pheomelanic in composition than darker melanocytes; (iii) in adult melanocyte cultures, EM correlates with the ethnic background of the donors (African-American > Indian > Caucasian); and (iv) MC 1 R loss-of-function mutations do not necessarily alter the phenotype of cultured melanocytes...|$|R

40|$|Capital {{punishment}} in this country, and in South Carolina, {{has its roots}} in racial subjugation, stereotype, and animosity. The extreme disparities we report here have dampened due to the combined effects of decreasing levels of open racial antagonism, the reforms of the modem death penalty, including categorical exemptions for juveniles and person with intellectual disabilities and prohibition of the imposition of the death penalty for the crime of rape, and the (small) increase in diversity in capital juries. But dampened does not mean eradicated. Significant disparities in the administration of capital punishment persist today. The color of a defendant 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>skin</b> (and the color of the victim 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>skin)</b> are still the strongest predictors of whether capital punishment will be south and imposed. No less neutral an authority than the Government Accounting Office has concluded that in studies of capital punishment, findings of statistically significant racial disparity, particularly race of victim disparity, are ubiquitous. Similarly, while gross racial stereotyping and animosity is less common in modern death penalty cases, some instances still occur, and many, many cases involve only slightly disguised racism on the part of judges, jurors, prosecutors, and defense counsel. To imagine that a punishment whose history is so steeped in racism can ever be administered in a race neutral way is more than color blindness, and more than wishful thinking; it is willful blindness...|$|R

However, there are very few studies on chemical and pharmacological properties using the skin of this fish. This study was undertaken in order to investigate the effect of aqueous crude extract of <b>S.</b> hispidus <b>skin</b> (SAE) in different nociception models. Here, we report that intraperitoneal administration of SAE inhibited the abdominal constrictions induced by acetic acid in mice. In addition to the effect seen in the abdominal constriction model, SAE was also able to inhibit the hyperalgesia induced by carrageenan and prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) in mice. This potent antinociceptive effect was observed in the hot plate model too, but not in tail-flick test. Naloxone, an opioid receptor antagonist, was able to block the antinociceptive effect of SAE in the abdominal constriction and hot plate models. In addition, SAE did not present cytotoxic or genotoxic effect in human peripheral blood cells.
