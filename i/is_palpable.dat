5|$|The thyroid {{itself is}} {{examined}} by {{observation of the}} gland and surrounding neck for swelling or enlargement. It is then felt, usually from behind, and a person is often asked to swallow to better feel the gland against the fingers of the examiner. The gland moves {{up and down with}} swallowing because of its attachments to the thyroid and cricoid cartilages. In a healthy person the gland is not visible yet <b>is</b> <b>palpable</b> as a soft mass. Examination of the thyroid gland includes the search for abnormal masses and the assessment of overall thyroid size. The character of the thyroid, swellings, nodules, and their consistency may all be able to be felt. If a goitre is present, an examiner may also feel down the neck consider tapping {{the upper part of the}} chest to check for extension. Further tests may include raising the arms (Pemberton's sign), listening to the gland with a stethoscope for bruits, testing of reflexes, and palpation of the lymph nodes in the head and neck. A medical examination of the thyroid will also include observation of the person as a whole, to look for systemic signs such as weight gain or loss, hair loss, and signs in other locations – such as protrusion of the eyes or swelling of the calves in Grave's disease.|$|E

25|$|In 1992 the Canadian {{government}} {{declared a}} moratorium on the Northern Cod fishery that, for the past 500 years, had largely shaped the lives and communities of Canada's eastern coast. The interplay between fishing societies and the resources on which they depend <b>is</b> <b>palpable</b> {{to even the most}} unacquainted observer: fisheries transform the ecosystem, which in turn pushes the fishery and society to adapt. In the summer of 1992, when the Northern Cod biomass fell to one percent of its earlier level, it became apparent to Canada's federal government that this relationship had been pushed to the breaking point and a moratorium was declared, ending the region's half-millennium run with the Northern Cod.|$|E

25|$|Lübeck {{was born}} in Padingbüttel, a small town {{situated}} some 70km north of Bremen. His father (also named Vincent) worked as organist first at Glückstadt and then, from 1647, at the Marienkirche in Flensburg, where he was succeeded in 1654 by Caspar Förckelrath. Lübeck's father died that year, and Förckelrath married the widow; it follows {{that he must have}} been young Lübeck's first teacher. According to scholar Wolfram Syré, Lübeck may have also studied under Andreas Kneller, whose influence <b>is</b> <b>palpable</b> in Lübeck's surviving keyboard works. In late 1675 Lübeck became organist of St. Cosmae et Damiani in Stade. The city had been a prominent member of the Hanseatic League, but by 1675 it was being slowly eclipsed by nearby Hamburg. Nevertheless, St. Cosmae had an organ built by the celebrated Arp Schnitger (which still survives, although it has been reconstructed). Upon accepting the post, Lübeck married, as was custom in some parts of North Germany, the daughter of his predecessor, one Susanne Becker.|$|E

Concluding the review on a mixed note, Paoletta wrote [...] "the melody line <b>is</b> <b>palpable</b> and Carey's voice is appreciable, but [...] "Say Somethin'" [...] is mostly a reminder {{of a time when}} Carey required others to boost her chart heft."

[...] Film Journal Internationals Ethan Alter said, [...] "Dhoom 2 has all {{of the benefits of}} a big-budget Bollywood production: big-name stars, exotic locales, well-produced musical numbers and elaborate (by Bollywood standards, anyway) action sequences. It makes no lasting contributions to world cinema, but if two-and-a-half hours of disposable entertainment are all you're after, you could do far worse." [...] L.A. Weeklys David Chute stated the film was, [...] "A movie meal as satisfying as this one can make you feel that nothing else matters." [...] Jaspreet Pandohar of the BBC gave it a two-star rating, writing [...] "By roping in acclaimed action director Alan Amin {{to take care of the}} thrills and spills, you'd expect Gadhvi to have spent time crafting out a sophisticated storyline instead of simply sending his cast on a cat-and-mouse chase around the globe. It's only Roshan's charismatic performance as the criminal mastermind, and the sizzling chemistry he shares with Rai's sassy cohort, that rescues this adventure from becoming an elongated tourism commercial."

50|$|Cervical {{lymphadenopathy}} {{is a sign}} or a symptom, not a diagnosis. The causes are varied, and may be inflammatory, degenerative, or neoplastic.

500|$|The Montreal Film Journal {{called it}} [...] "one {{of the best}} crafted Hollywood action flicks." [...] Screenwriting guru Syd Field lauded the plot of Terminator2, saying, for example, [...] "every scene sets up the next, like links in a chain of {{dramatic}} action." [...] Roger Ebert, writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, who gave the film 3.5 stars {{out of a possible}} 4, praised Schwarzenegger's performance, saying, [...] "Schwarzenegger's genius as a movie star is to find roles that build on, rather than undermine, his physical and vocal characteristics." [...] Hal Hinson, reviewer for The Washington Post, was also very positive in his review, writing that: [...] "No one in the movies today can match Cameron's talent for this kind of hyperbolic, big-screen action. Cameron, who directed the first Terminator and Aliens, doesn't just slam us over the head with the action. In staging the movie's gigantic set pieces, he has an eye for both grandeur and beauty; he possesses that rare director's gift for transforming the objects he shoots so that we see, for example, the lyrical muscularity of an 18-wheel truck. Because of Cameron, the movie is the opposite of its Terminator character; it's a machine with a human heart." [...] Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune was extremely enthusiastic about the film, giving it 3 1/2 stars, [...] "thanks to some truly spectacular and at times mystifying special effects – as well as some surprisingly solid acting, this is one terrific action picture, more enjoyable than the original."

2500|$|Criticism {{of the law}} {{has been}} levied on its wording. Lawrence Stanley noted that [...] "The moral {{slippage}} in the law <b>is</b> <b>palpable</b> {{in the way it}} conflates images of actual minors with fictional representations: it refers to 'depictions of minors., and, by reference to the other provisions in the law, defines acts engaged in by 'persons', but how is a cartoon character a person?"
