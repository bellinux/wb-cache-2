5|$|By 1965, Japan Air Lines was {{headquartered}} in the Tokyo Building in Marunouchi, Chiyoda, Tokyo. By this time {{over half of}} JAL's revenue was generated on transpacific routes to the United States and the airline was lobbying the United States for fifth freedom rights to fly transatlantic routes from the East Coast. The transpacific route was extended east <b>from</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>to</b> New York in November 1966 and to London in 1967; flights between San Francisco and London ended in December 1972.|$|E
5|$|Government {{financial}} support for the tour was withdrawn by Prime Minister Edward Heath's Conservative government in 1970, but Pegler decided to return for the 1970 season.

Pegler worked his passage home <b>from</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>to</b> England on a P cruise ship in 1971, giving lectures about trains and travel; he was declared bankrupt in the High Court in 1972.|$|E

5|$|Harding's death {{came as a}} great {{shock to}} the nation. The {{president}} was liked and admired, and the press and public had followed his illness closely, and been reassured by his apparent recovery. Harding was returned to his train in a casket for a journey across the nation followed closely in the newspapers. Nine million people lined the tracks as Harding's body was taken <b>from</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>to</b> Washington, D.C., and after services there, home to Marion, Ohio, for burial.|$|E
5|$|Rosenberg {{traveled}} <b>from</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>to</b> Hawaii, possibly on a whaler, {{arriving in}} Oahu sometime before December 1886. At that time, Hawaii was a predominantly Christian kingdom; Christian missionaries had successfully converted {{a large segment}} of the population after traditional Hawaiian religion was suppressed by the monarchy. In the 1880s, however, King Kalākaua encouraged the revival of Hawaiian traditions, hoping to inspire nationalistic sentiment. He revived traditional Hawaiian music and dance, including hula, and observed some practices of Hawaiian religion. Kalākaua became a powerful king, unconstrained by political factors.|$|E
5|$|The {{loss of the}} Maine {{highlighted}} to {{the administration}} the nation's shortage of modern warships, setting off a scramble for the acquisition of more ships. One significant order given by Long was to transfer the USS Oregon (one of the Navy's most powerful ships) from the west coast to the Caribbean; the ship made the journey around Cape Horn <b>from</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>to</b> Key West, Florida, in 66 days. War was declared in April 1898. Roosevelt resigned his post the next month, a move Long thought foolhardy but later acknowledged was significant in advancing Roosevelt's career.|$|E

5|$|Between 1847 and 1870, the {{population}} of San Francisco increased from 500 to 150,000. The Gold Rush wealth and population increase led to significantly improved transportation between California and the East Coast. The Panama Railway, spanning the Isthmus of Panama, was finished in 1855. Steamships, including those owned by the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, began regular service <b>from</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>to</b> Panama, where passengers, goods and mail would take the train across the Isthmus and board steamships headed to the East Coast. One ill-fated journey, that of the S.S. Central America, ended in disaster as the ship sank in a hurricane {{off the coast of}} the Carolinas in 1857, with approximately three tons of California gold aboard.|$|E
5|$|O'Brien {{intended}} the brewery to be a modern facility {{similar to those}} in California, and brought in Charles Bolbrugge, a brewer <b>from</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco,</b> <b>to</b> run the operation. The facility probably took the form of a tower brewery, which minimised the requirements for power supplies, and had a cooperage built adjacent to it. Some of the equipment was probably reused from the local Eldorado Bottling works, which had closed three years before, and possibly the old Dawson City Brewery, which was then combined with up-to-date steam pumps, bottling machines and an artificial refrigeration plant. A variety of second-hand bottles were probably collected from around Dawson City, many of which were then reused at the new brewery, the remainder being discarded along the nearby river shore. The malt and hops for the brewing process were imported from California.|$|E
