The Back 2 Basics Tour, which was {{sponsored}} by Xbox, was scheduled for November 2003. However, during a concert at New York's Hammerstein Ballroom, Durst was hit by an object thrown from the crowd. Durst finished the remaining two songs of Limp Bizkit's set and after the concert, Durst had seven stitches administered by a private physician. During the end of 2003, Limp Bizkit cancelled their tour dates <b>in</b> <b>Southeast</b> Asia after there was a United States Department of State warning of increased security threats abroad. Limp Bizkit planned to play shows in Bali, Bangkok and Manila. However, after a terrorist bombing in Istanbul, Turkey occurred, the United States Department of State issued a travel advisory, and Limp Bizkit cancelled the shows <b>in</b> <b>Southeast</b> Asia. Although they did not perform <b>in</b> <b>Southeast</b> Asia, Limp Bizkit did perform in South Korea and Japan. In January 2004, there were rumors that Limp Bizkit were going to tour with the rock band Kiss, although the band was unable to, citing scheduling conflicts.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1917, {{divisions}} {{had begun}} appearing between the Ghadar Party in America on the one hand, and the Berlin Committee and the German high command on the other. Reports from German agents working with Ghadarites <b>in</b> <b>Southeast</b> Asia and the United States clearly indicated to the European wing a significant element of disorganisation, as well as unrealism in gauging public mood and support within the Ghadarite organisation. The failure of the February plot, the lack of bases <b>in</b> <b>Southeast</b> Asia following China's participation {{in the war in}} 1917, and the problems of supporting a Southeast Asian operation through the sea stemmed the plans significantly. Infiltration by British agents, change in American attitude and stance, and the changing fortunes of the war meant the massive conspiracy for revolution within India never succeeded.|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} studies have found {{hypertension}} prevalence to be higher <b>in</b> the <b>southeast</b> region of the United States than in other U. S. regions. To test the hypotheses that hypertension incidence is higher <b>in</b> the <b>southeast</b> than <b>in</b> other regions, and that higher levels of known hypertension risk factors <b>in</b> the <b>southeast</b> explain the difference in incidence, data from a nationally representative, longitudinal cohort study of a sample drawn from the U. S. population, the NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-Up Study (1971 - 1984), were analyzed. In the United States, age-adjusted relative odds of incident hypertension between 1971 and 1984 did not vary consistently with region or with urbanization level. There was only a trend of higher relative odds in nonmetropolitan areas than in suburbs <b>in</b> the <b>southeast</b> <b>in</b> younger white men and older white women. Thus, convincing evidence to support the hypothesis of elevated hypertension incidence <b>in</b> the <b>southeast</b> region or <b>in</b> nonmetropolitan areas was not obtained. Further studies of region and hypertension incidence are needed to assess regional variation in larger, more recent cohorts...|$|R
