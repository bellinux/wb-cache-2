Bejan — the party was subsequently known as National Liberal Party-Petre N. Bejan). One of his last actions as cabinet member had been to sign the document officially rejecting the Marshall Plan.|$|E
5|$|During {{his second}} term as governor, in 1906, Beckham made a bid to become a U.S. senator. His stance in favor of {{prohibition}} cost him the votes of four legislators <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party</b> and the General Assembly gave the seat to Republican William O. Bradley, who had been governor in 1895-99. Six years later Beckham secured the seat by popular election, but he lost his re-election bid in 1920 largely because of his pro-temperance views and his opposition to women's suffrage. Though he continued to {{play an active role}} in state politics for another two decades, he never returned to elected office, failing in his gubernatorial bid in 1927 and his senatorial campaign in 1936. He died in Louisville on January 9, 1940.|$|E

He was soon considered a maverick <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party</b> after McGeer became critical of the government because Pattullo did not appoint him to cabinet. According to McGeer, Pattullo led him to believe he would become the province's Attorney-General.|$|E

In return for Rizzo's support, the victorious Nixon granted more federal funding to Philadelphia.

25|$|Differences in East Pakistan further {{encouraged}} the Baloch separatism, {{and in an}} attempt to intimidate the communists in East, President Mirza initiated massive arrests of communists and party workers of Awami League in East Pakistan, which damaged the image of West-Pakistan in the East. The Western contingent's lawmakers determinately followed the idea of Westernized Parliamentary form of the democracy when East opted for becoming a socialist state. The One Unit program and centralizing of national economy on the USSR model was met with great hostility and resistance in West, although the Eastern contingent's economy was quickly centralized by Suhrawardy's government. Egoistic problems grew between the two Bengali leaders further damaging the unity of the country, which soon forced Suhrawardy to lose an edge <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party</b> to the growing influence of cleric Maulana Bhashani. Resigning under a threat of Mirza's dismissal, Suhrawardy was succeeded by I. I. Chundrigar in 1957.|$|E

5000|$|The {{defeat of}} the {{governing}} centre-right parties {{came as no surprise}} as the coalition parties had already been defeated in the 1993 local elections. The majority of the voters were disenchanted with coalition’s shock therapy policies and scandals which had already brought about the dismissal of Prime Minister Mart Laar. Laar’s premiership was also characterised with internal fights between coalition partners as well as different groups <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> Fatherland <b>party.</b> This led to a split in 1994, when several groups left Fatherland party.|$|R
25|$|In the debate, Chamberlain's {{government}} was criticised {{not only by}} the Opposition but also by respected members of his own party. The Opposition forced a vote, effectively a motion of no confidence, which the government won with a greatly reduced majority. Over a quarter of Conservative members voted with the Opposition or abstained, despite a three line whip, and this made it clear that support for Chamberlain <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party</b> was crumbling. There were calls for national unity to be established by formation of an all-party coalition, but it was not possible for Chamberlain to reach agreement with the opposition Labour and Liberal parties who refused to serve under his leadership, though they would accept a different Conservative leader. On Friday, 10 May, the day that Nazi Germany invaded Belgium and the Netherlands, Chamberlain resigned and was succeeded as Prime Minister by Churchill.|$|E
25|$|In October, he {{was named}} prefect of Brăila County, a job which he took because his wife's declining health {{required}} advanced medical services. As an outsider, he was asked by Catargiu to audit the local Conservative chapter, to the annoyance of a junior party leader, Nicolae Filipescu. Filipescu turned to sabotaging Rosetti's work; the latter contacted Bianu and, through him, PNL chairman Dimitrie Sturdza, to help him appoint a bipartisan council of reputable men. When news of this attempted partnership broke nationally, the Conservatives were irritated. After another series of challenges, including the cholera pandemic (eventually handled by Iacob Felix), Danube floods, and dockers' strikes, Rosetti moved on to a similar position in Bacău County in October 1893. He inaugurated an anti-corruption campaign and various public works, but also appealed to nepotism, such as when he ensured the victory of his protege, G. I. Donici, in the by-election for the Assembly. By April 1894, PNL agitators instigated the peasants against Conservative tax reforms, causing riots in Ardeoani and Răcăciuni. Voices <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party</b> called Rosetti responsible for the 17 wounded Gendarmes and the unknown of number of peasants brutalized during retaliations.|$|E
500|$|Harrison {{had proven}} unpopular even <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party,</b> {{and by the}} start of 1892, McKinley was talked about as a {{potential}} presidential candidate. McKinley's name was not offered in nomination at the 1892 Republican National Convention, where he served as permanent chairman, but some delegates voted for him anyway, and he finished third behind Harrison (who won a first ballot victory) and Blaine. Hanna had sought support from delegates, but his and McKinley's strategy is uncertain, due to lack of surviving documents. According to Hanna biographer William T. Horner, [...] "McKinley's behavior at the convention supports the idea that he liked the attention but was not ready for a campaign". [...] According to McKinley biographer H. Wayne Morgan, many delegates [...] "saw in [...] their nominee for 1896".|$|E

5000|$|Upon his {{entry into}} {{office with the}} death of his predecessor, Republican Richard A. Snelling in 1991, Governor Howard Dean faced a {{national}} economic recession and a $60 million state budget deficit. Facing some opposition <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> Democratic <b>Party,</b> he advocated for and received from the legislature a balanced budget. This set a precedent of fiscal restraint, which has continued in Vermont through 2011. In 1999, five moderate Democratic legislators, called [...] "Blue Dogs", joined with Republicans to pass Democratic, but fiscally conservative, governor Howard Dean's plans for an income tax cut.|$|R
500|$|President Harrison {{had proven}} unpopular even <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party,</b> {{and with the}} start of 1892, McKinley was talked about as a {{potential}} candidate. [...] At the 1892 Republican National Convention in Minneapolis, McKinley's keynote address sparked wild applause from a convention friendly to him. [...] This popularity did not translate into delegate votes; Harrison's supporters were {{in control of the}} convention throughout. Hanna, a delegate from Ohio, promoted McKinley to delegates. McKinley, never a declared candidate, finished third, a fraction of a vote behind Blaine, who had declared himself not to be a candidate. [...] Despite Harrison's success, McKinley was carried from the convention hall to his hotel by supporters after he adjourned the convention. [...] According to Morgan, many delegates [...] "saw in [...] their nominee for 1896".|$|E
500|$|Meisdalshagen was {{regarded}} as an internal opponent of the Labour Party's foreign affairs and defence policy. His obituarist in Verdens Gang writes that he was [...] "more controversial <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party</b> than outside of it". This tendency had surfaced already in the 1940s, when he very reluctantly accepted the Norwegian signing of the North Atlantic Treaty. Meisdalshagen remained skeptic to a non-neutral {{foreign policy in the}} 1950s, and in February 1951 a conflict with Minister of Defence Jens Chr. Hauge arose. Meisdalshagen formally dissented against a proposal to grant an extra [...] to the Norwegian Armed Forces for the years 1951 and 1952, and he became furious when he entered a budgetary debate without being notified of a certain press release, issued by Jens Chr. Hauge, where another grant of NOK 125 million was declared. According to Haakon Lie, Meisdalshagen influenced persons in the newspaper Oppland Arbeiderblad to write and print an editorial titled [...] ("Let Hauge Go"). Meisdalshagen {{was a member of the}} board of Oppland Arbeiderblad from 1945 to 1957, and had spent some time working there before the war.|$|E
500|$|On February 13, 1871, Governor John W. Stevenson {{resigned}} {{his post}} {{to accept a}} seat in the U.S. Senate. Stevenson had ascended to the governorship on the death of John L. Helm, and had no lieutenant governor. As president of the Senate, Leslie was the ex-officio lieutenant governor, and next in line to succeed Stevenson. A gubernatorial election was already scheduled later in 1871, and Leslie was among several nominees put forward by the Democrats. Because of Leslie's opposition to the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, his candidacy was opposed by Henry Watterson, founder of the powerful Louisville Courier-Journal. Despite this, Leslie emerged from a field of Democratic candidates that included future governors John Y. Brown and J. Proctor Knott and former Confederate governor Richard Hawes. John G. Carlisle was chosen as Leslie's running mate, and was declared by one commentator to be [...] "by odds, the ablest man on the ticket". Leslie's opposition to the Southern Railroad bill while serving in the state senate proved a liability with some voters <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party.</b> Because of his southern sympathies, he was also opposed by the more progressive [...] "New Departure" [...] wing of his party. Nevertheless, he enjoyed support from the Bourbon Democrats in the state, as well as the state's tobacco interests and the Louisville and Nashville Railroad.|$|E
50|$|The Unionist {{candidate}} Sir Henry Hibbert was {{a leading}} proponent of full Tariff Reform who had done much to define the policy in the 1880s. However, the Unionist national leadership had decided by 1913 to shelve the policy with respect to food duties. This placed Hibbert <b>in</b> conflict with <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party</b> leadership {{as he continued to}} argue his position during the campaign.|$|R

500|$|Even as Cleveland {{took office}} as {{president}} in March 1893, {{there were signs}} of an economic decline. [...] Sherman's act required the government to pay out gold in exchange for silver and paper currency, and through the early months of 1893 gold flowed out of the Treasury. [...] On April 22, 1893, the amount of gold in the Treasury dropped below $100million {{for the first time since}} 1879, adding to the unease. [...] Rumors that Europeans were about to redeem a large sum for gold caused desperate selling on the stock market, the start of the Panic of 1893. [...] By August, many firms had gone bankrupt, and a special session of Congress convened, called by Cleveland to repeal the silver purchase act. [...] Bryan, who was still in Congress, spoke eloquently against the repeal, but Cleveland forced it through. [...] The President's uncompromising stand for gold alienated many <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party</b> (most southern and western Democrats were pro-silver). The economy failed to improve, and when the President in 1894 sent federal troops to Illinois to break up the Pullman strike, he outraged even more Democrats. [...] In late 1894, pro-silver Democrats began to organize in the hope of taking control of the party from Cleveland and other Gold Democrats and nominating a silver candidate in 1896. [...] In this, they were led by Illinois Governor John Peter Altgeld, who had opposed Cleveland over the Pullman strike. [...] The Democrats lost control of both houses of Congress in the 1894 midterm elections, with a number of southern states, usually solid for the Democrats, electing Republican or Populist congressmen.|$|E
500|$|Before resigning, Rutherford's {{government}} had called a Royal Commission into the Alberta and Great Waterways affair, and this commission had not {{reported by the}} time that Sifton took office. [...] Between that and the proroguing of the legislature, the new Premier enjoyed a calm that lasted until November 10, when the legislature reconvened. [...] Conservative leader Edward Michener attacked the government's speech from the throne for failing to commit itself on railway policy and attacked Sifton for failing to call a general election or seek the confidence of the legislature during his first half year in office. [...] In the meantime, Sifton was facing a breach <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party</b> on the railway question. [...] Many Liberals from the south of the province, including Sifton himself, felt inclined to abandon the construction of [...] "pioneer" [...] railways (such as the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway) designed to hasten the settlement of the province's emptier areas, and concentrate only on those connecting major population centres. [...] Members from the north of the province, who comprised most of the Liberal caucus, disagreed, and were vehement in their insistence that the A be built. [...] Even among this latter group there were divisions: some Liberals agreed with the Conservatives that the railway should be directly built by the government, while others, including Cross, favoured a partnership with a [...] "responsible company". [...] These divisions were not calmed by the release of the commission's report, whose majority condemned Rutherford and Cross for poor judgment even as it concluded that there was insufficient evidence to find that they had engaged in improper behaviour.|$|E

50|$|One of CIN's {{better known}} stories looked at how then BiH Federation Prime Minister Nedžad Branković got an almost free apartment.

CIN's work, which involved finding a second sources of documents that had been removed from the official records, led to two investigations of Brankovic and then an indictment by cantonal prosecutors.

Despite the opposition of many <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party,</b> including not only Vare's powerful Philadelphia machine, but also many [...] "wets" [...] who revolted and created a separate Liberal Party that autumn — thereby giving the Democratic candidate two lines on the November ballot — Pinchot narrowly prevailed, defeating Hemphill by a margin of 1,068,874 to 1,010,204.|$|E
