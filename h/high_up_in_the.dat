He planned to dig a canal through the Isthmus of Corinth in Greece and sent a chief centurion to survey the work.|$|E
5|$|Diplodocids like Apatosaurus {{are often}} portrayed with their necks held <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air, {{allowing}} them to browse on tall trees. Some studies state diplodocid necks were less flexible than previously believed, because {{the structure of the}} neck vertebrae would not have allowed the neck to bend far upwards, and that sauropods like Apatosaurus were adapted to low browsing or ground feeding.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} in 1987 of a primitive tomb at Mondeval de Sora <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{mountains to the}} south of Cortina testifies to the presence of Mesolithic man in the area {{as far back as the}} 6th millennium B.C. In the 6th century B.C., Etruscan writing was introduced in the province of Cadore, in whose possession is remained until the early 15th century. From the 3rd century B.C., the Romans assimilated the Veneti people, giving the area the name of Amplitium (from amplus meaning wide), today's Ampezzo.|$|E

The same year they travelled to Italy where they continued their honeymoon in Ravello and Amalfi. The small oil-on-canvas work Interior. Marie Krøyer painting. Ravello shows Marie painting while they were there. They also visited the artist Kristian Zahrtmann who spent his summers in the house he had bought in Civita d'Antino, <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mountains in the Abruzzo region some 150km (90 miles) south of Rome. Thanks to his enthusiasm, the town became a favourite destination for Scandinavian painters. In addition to Marie, the lunch scene includes Zahrtmann and Krøyer himself.|$|E
5|$|Later, diplodocids {{were often}} portrayed with their necks held <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air, {{allowing}} them to graze from tall trees. Studies using computer models have shown that neutral posture of the neck was horizontal, rather than vertical, and scientists such as Kent Stephens have used this to argue that sauropods including Diplodocus did not raise their heads much above shoulder level. A nuchal ligament may have held the neck in this position. A 2009 study found that all tetrapods appear to hold their necks at the maximum possible vertical extension when in a normal, alert posture, and argued that the same would hold true for sauropods barring any unknown, unique characteristics that set the soft tissue anatomy of their necks apart from other animals. One of the sauropod models {{in this study was}} Diplodocus, which they found would have held its neck at about a 45° angle with the head pointed downwards in a resting posture.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon {{is shown}} to be {{as he would have}} been <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mountains, as a mortal and imperilled man. While this seems in some way demeaning to Napoleon's figure (and {{contrasts}} in the extreme with David's version, which shows Napoleon impervious to the cold, and in a heroic light), Delaroche's artwork was not intended to portray him in a hostile or unbecoming way. Delaroche wanted to depict Napoleon as a credible man, who suffered and underwent human hardship too, on his most daring exploits, and felt that making him appear as he really {{would have been in the}} situation would by no means debase or diminish Napoleon's iconic status or legacy, but rather make him a more admirable person.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{service was}} operated by trains composed of an engine and three carriages. Thirty-two passengers could be accommodated in each carriage, which had longitudinal bench seating and sliding {{doors at the}} ends, leading onto a platform for boarding and alighting. It was reasoned {{that there was nothing}} to look at in the tunnels, so the only windows were in a narrow band <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> carriage sides. Gate-men rode on the carriage platforms to operate the lattice gates and announce the station names to the passengers. Because of their claustrophobic interiors, the carriages soon became known as padded cells. Unlike other railways, the C had no ticket classes or paper tickets; when the railway began operations, a flat fare of two pence, collected at a turnstile, was charged. Despite the cramped carriages and competition from bus and tram services, the railway attracted 5.1million passengers in 1891, its first year of operation. To alleviate overcrowding, the fleet of rolling stock was enlarged.|$|E
25|$|During the 1970s, it {{was widely}} {{believed}} that the Neanderthals lacked modern speech capacities. It was claimed that they possessed a hyoid bone so <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vocal tract as to preclude the possibility of producing certain vowel sounds.|$|E
25|$|Other {{causes of}} death are cats, rats, {{collisions}} with vehicles and windows, and human disturbance of nesting birds, including riverbank works with heavy machinery.

25|$|When he reemerged from prison, in 1952, Brother Agathon {{decided to}} enter the priesthood as a hieromonk, and became Father Daniil. He was {{originally}} assigned to Crasna, then moved to more remotes sketes. After a stint at Sihăstria Monastery, he moved <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Rarău Mountains, Bukovina. With the help of Ilie Cleopa, the influential Orthodox preacher at Sihăstria, Daniil was appointed Starets. In this new capacity, he resumed the spreading of Kulygin's ideas, forming a prayer group with about a dozen followers, and outlined a new plan for a monastery of the intellectual elite.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} compete in Macau, drivers had {{to compete in}} an FIA-regulated {{championship}} meeting during the calendar year, in either the FIA Formula Three European Championship {{or one of the}} domestic championships, with drivers placed <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rankings of these respective championships given priority in receiving an invitation to the meeting. Within the twenty-eight car grid of the event, two of the three major Formula Three series were represented by their respective champion. Defending race winner Felix Rosenqvist, the Formula Three European champion, was joined in Macau by Japanese series winner Nick Cassidy. As was the case the previous year, Euroformula Open racer Yu Kanamaru was a late addition to the entry list at Carlin after George Russell was withdrawn from the Grand Prix.|$|E
25|$|Reed's first {{investigation}} is the Magdalena Cartel, {{believed to be}} responsible for 75% of New York's cocaine trade. Higgins had made contact with socialite and philanthropist Teresa Castillo (Socorro Santiago), who he believed may be able to help him get inside the cartel. She gives Reed information leading him to the Magdalena safe house, where he chases down their leader, Rey (Paolo Andino). However, Rey turns out to be head of the Latin Lords, the main rival of the Magdalena Cartel; the Cartel was using Reed to take out their competition. Reed discovers Teresa's real name is Magdalena Rojas, and she runs the cartel. He arrests her, but she tells him she doesn't know who the mole is, only that as their information was always accurate, she knows it is someone <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> OCU.|$|E
25|$|Clearing is {{when the}} player in {{possession}} of the ball is pressed hard, often near his own goal, and chooses to shoot the ball away with low precision simply {{in order to get}} out of a dangerous situation. When opponent pressure is extremely high, the ball is often cleared to a corner kick or to a throw-in. Clearing long, but into opponent control, may give the defence time and the opportunity to organise, including setting up the correct formation and pressure height. If the attack was high up the field, such as in or near the penalty area, defenders will thus quickly push out, and attackers will then be forced to retreat in order to avoid offside in the next move. Clearing may be combined with an attempt to hit a long pass or a long through ball. Players <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field who are pressed hard, and who are eager to avoid a counter-attack, may in some instances combine clearing with a shot.|$|E

25|$|The Van Gurjars ("forest Gurjars") {{are found}} in the Shivalik hills area of North India. The Van Gurjars follow Islam, and they have their own clans, similar to the Hindu gotras. They are a {{pastoral}} semi-nomadic community, practising transhumance. In the winter season, the Van Gurjars migrate with their herds to the Shiwalik foothills, and in summer, they migrate to pastures <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mountains. The Van Gurjars have had conflicts with the forest authorities, who prohibited human and livestock populations inside a reserved park, and blamed the Van Gurjar community for poaching and timber smuggling. After the creation of the Rajaji National Park (RNP), the Van Gurjars in Deharadun were asked to shift to a resettlement colony at Pathari near Hardwar. In 1992, when they returned to the foothills, the RNP authorities tried to block them from the park area. The community fought back and finally the forest authorities had to relent. Later, a community forest management (CFM) programme aiming to involve the Van Gurjars in forest management was launched.|$|E

Within the twenty-eight car grid of the event, three of the four major Formula Three series were represented by their respective champion. Esteban Ocon, the FIA Formula Three European champion, was joined in Macau by British champion Martin Cao and German series winner Markus Pommer. All-Japan Formula Three champion Nobuharu Matsushita did not partake in the meeting and so the highest-placed Japanese series driver that participated in the Grand Prix was national title contender Kenta Yamashita. The entry list included one woman driver, Tatiana Calderón, {{for the first time in}} Macau since Cathy Muller raced in the 1983 edition. Euroformula Open driver Yu Kanamaru was called up by Carlin as a late replacement for Jake Dennis who opted to withdraw from the race.|$|E
25|$|India had a shaky start, with Sehwag and Tendulkar both early by Malinga, {{leaving them}} {{struggling}} at 31 for two. Kohli and Gautam Gambhir started the recovery with some fluent stroke play and quick running between wickets, taking India to 114 before Kohli was caught-and-bowled by Dilshan for 35. When {{he was on}} 30, Gambhir mistimed a shot off the bowling of Suraj Randiv, sending the ball <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air, but Kulasekara could not hold on to a difficult chance at long off. Kohli and Gambhir put together an 83-run partnership before Kohli's dismissal. Dhoni came in after Kohli to bat at number five. Gambhir and Dhoni added 109 for the fourth wicket with Gambhir scoring 97. Gambhir tried to finish his century with a boundary, but was bowled by Thisara. Following Gambhir's dismissal, 52 runs were required off 52 balls. Yuvraj and Dhoni took India to victory, and Dhoni sealed the match hitting a six off Kulasekara, when only 4 runs were required off 11 balls. Dhoni finished on 91 not out from 79 deliveries. With this defeat, Sri Lanka lost their second consecutive World Cup final defeat in ODIs.|$|E
