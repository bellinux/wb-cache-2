25|$|Krupa {{praised the}} use of the Wii U gamepad as the Camera Obsura and enjoyed combat for most of the game, but found the latter third of the game tedious due to {{repetitive}} battles. Corriae enjoyed {{the use of}} the gamepad despite some control issues, Bates was highly positive about the thrill it brought into battles, while Turi found that the function did not bring long-term enjoyment and that backtracking through environments negatively impacted on the experience. Wilson likewise enjoyed the gamepad's role in the game, while faulting most other aspects including the high amount of health items and character controls. Orry said that the new controls made combat more claustrophobic than in previous games, while Brown enjoyed the immersion the gamepad brought. Famitsu was highly positive about {{the use of the}} gamepad, saying that it <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> {{were in the midst of}} battles. These sentiments were echoed by Dengeki, but stated that some combat situations made aiming difficult. Multiple reviewers mentioned and generally faulted the stiff controls and character movement.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the release}} and {{commercial}} success of [...] "Love the Way You Lie" [...] in 2010, Eminem wanted to record an alternative version with Rihanna {{as the lead}} vocalist, viewing aspects of a relationship from a female perspective, unlike the original, which featured Eminem as lead vocalist and was from a male perspective. In an interview for MTV, Rihanna initially stated she was against recording a sequel: [...] "When I first heard the idea about doing a part two, I was just completely against it. I just <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> couldn't beat the 'original'. There's {{no way you can}} outdo that, so why compete with it?". She said when she first heard the original demo of the song in the studio with Eminem, sung by American singer-songwriter Skylar Grey, her reservations about recording it went away. While the demo was only accompanied by a piano, Rihanna and her team added drums and later vocals from Eminem.|$|E

500|$|Most of the album's lyrics {{were written}} by Static, from the R band Playa. While the band was growing apart, he was invited by Blackground to be a lead writer for the album after writing [...] "Are You That Somebody?" [...] and [...] "Try Again". Static {{was a part of}} Aaliyah's close group of friends, which {{included}} Missy Elliott and Timbaland, and shared an infatuation with her. He found Aaliyah to be ideal for his songwriting style, while she believed that he could accurately portray her feelings. A subtly sexual lyricist, he wrote [...] "Rock the Boat" [...] for her in 1999, but Blackground felt she was not ready for the song. Barry Hankerson said of his songwriting, [...] "We always were protective over every lyric... But he did things where you never felt offended. You just <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> overheard someone thinking... he was clever... Aaliyah depended on him [...] he depended on her." [...] Elliott said that he was [...] "a part of that bridge of Aaliyah growing up lyrically". While she discussed the lyrics with Static, Aaliyah consulted Bud'da about the sound and musical direction of the album. She was interested in learning about the UK garage scene at the time.|$|E
500|$|The user {{interface}} design (UI) for The Last of Us underwent various different iterations throughout development. User interface designer Alexandria Neonakis {{originally intended to}} integrate the weapon upgrade system into the weapon slotting system, in order to constantly remind players to upgrade their weapons. Upon further iterations, Neonakis discovered that this integration resulted in a cluttered interface. Ultimately, {{it was decided that}} the upgrade system would be integrated in the form of upgrade benches, occasionally found throughout the game's world; this also solved another problem that Neonakis witnessed, in which players would upgrade to the lowest possible option, as opposed to saving parts for the higher options. Once it was decided to split the upgrade and slotting systems, the initial design was to select the weapons from a circle. This design, eventually considered [...] "clunky and slow", was replaced in preference of a list system. Neonakis has identified that the main problem with the list design was that it forced players to focus on navigating through menus during intense combat. This led to the final design, which allows players to swap and slot weapons in the same menu. To integrate the UI into the game, Neonakis separated the individual elements and changed their format. User interface programmer Paul Burg provided Neonakis with tools to move elements using their coordinates. All animated transitions were hard coded, which led to difficulty in creating smooth transitions. [...] "This was tedious and at times incredibly frustrating, but it also meant that we all had to be pretty creative in how things were designed," [...] Neonakis said. The game's crafting system was implemented into immediate gameplay, in order for players to feel involved. [...] "We needed to make it streamlined and fast enough that you <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> could take just that moment and be able to craft that thing that's going to mean your survival in the next thirty seconds, or your failure to survive," [...] lead game designer Jacob Minkoff said.|$|E
2500|$|The tracklist for The Road Chronicles visualette DVD is very {{different}} from the LP release. Amos stated: [...] "I think the visualettes connect [...] as well. The order is different though, which was very intentional. The order of the visual side of things is different than if you're just putting the sonic thing on headphones and taking a walk. I <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> had to experience it very, {{very different}}ly." ...|$|E

5000|$|After {{graduating from}} the Film and Television Institute of India, Mehta joined the Indian Space Research Organisation as a {{television}} producer. There, he was given almost total freedom in what to create. In an interview years later, Mehta remarked about how influential this was to his development: “It was an incredible experience. Traveling all over Gujarat, meeting people, making programs on whatever <b>you</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like,</b> whatever <b>you</b> came across. It was real, genuine experimentation with medium, with people. That experience has been vital to films that I’ve made.” ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{decision}} to shoot in Vancouver, {{where the first}} five years of The X-Files had been filmed and produced before the series had moved to Los Angeles, was an early idea; one that seemed right to both Chris Carter and David Duchovny. According to Duchovny, [...] "It all makes sense. You know, when Chris and I first talked about doing this movie, we kind of unconsciously both said, 'You know, I guess it should be in Vancouver, it really should be,' and it just <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> know, almost superstitiously like the right thing to do." [...] Filming in Vancouver also facilitated the return of many former crew members who had previously worked on The X-Files, as well as individuals who had worked on the other series that Ten Thirteen Productions had created. Frank Spotnitz said that [...] "In terms of making of the movie, we've brought together as many people as we can, not just from The X-Files but from all the shows that we did here in Vancouver – Harsh Realm, Millennium and The Lone Gunmen – and our crew is populated with all these faces that we'd worked with, over the past fifteen years. And there's even some people from the L.A. crew." ...|$|E

[...] "Mrs. Boutwell--that is to say Mrs. Waterford--couldn't stand this hotel any more than you, and she <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> do about the colony, so she rented a little house up on Wylie Street and {{furnished}} it from the East. I took the furniture off her hands: it's still in the house, by the way, which hasn't been rented. For I figured it out that another lady would be coming along with the same notions. Now {{you can look at the}} house any time you like." ...|$|E

I joined the strikers--I just had to do something." ...|$|R
5000|$|The line, [...] "Just go and lay {{your hand}} on a Pittsburgh Steelers fan" [...] stems from Daniels' feeling {{that the people in}} Pittsburgh are [...] "The salt of the earth, the finest, just the {{greatest}} people. The strength of America." [...] He says, [...] "I've gone to ball games at different places, but I've always felt the Pittsburgh Steelers fans, especially in the old stadium - I mean, they're steel workers and they're good old guys with blisters, or calluses on their hands. The strength of America is not in Washington, D.C., It's in our people, it's on the farms, in the factories. It's the people out here that make this country work. The truck drivers, the farmers. And these people, that's what they were, and I just <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> if <b>you</b> want to go to war, let me take some of these guys with me.

Why, I've always loved you, Stephen; but I didn't know it until I went to that detestable school. Then I found out--and I thought that was why you had sent me. But, when I came home, you almost broke my heart. That was why I flirted so with all those poor, nice boys --I wanted to hurt you but I never thought I succeeded. You just went on being FATHERLY. Then, when you brought Frank here, I almost gave up hope; and I tried to {{make up my mind}} to marry him; I should have done it if you had insisted. But I had to have one more try for happiness first. I had just one little hope to inspire me with sufficient boldness. I saw you, that night, when you came back here and picked up my rose! I had come back, myself, to be alone and unhappy." ...|$|R

I was in the Swan myself for a few months when I was a young fellow, and we had grand times aboard of that wessel. It seemed to me like a sort o' home to the sailors that they'd make for arter their woyages was over. Once, I reklect, we had a evenin' service, an' as several ships had come in from furrin parts that mornin' we had the Swan chock-full o' noo hands; but bless you, though they was noo to us they warn't noo to each other.

I saw some awful stuff and some good stuff. It was very immediate and exciting and when I came back to Melbourne I wanted to keep going, but there didn't exist such a place. So I talked around a bit, to a few actors and writers and directors, sounding them out about doing their own stuff, Australian stuff, for nothing ...
