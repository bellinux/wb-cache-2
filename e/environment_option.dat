Overview RFC 1408 [1], the specification for the Telnet <b>Environment</b> <b>Option,</b> specifies definitions for VAR and VALUE that are reversed from the BSD implementation of the Telnet <b>Environment</b> <b>option.</b> Since the BSD implementation was the reference implementation that the RFC was supposed to document, and is the base for many existing implementations, there exists an interoperability problem between implementations with conflicting definitions for VAR and VALUE. This document describes a method for allowing implementors {{to ensure that their}} implementation of the <b>Environment</b> <b>option</b> will be interoperable with as many other implementations as possible, by providing a set of heuristics {{that can be used to}} help identify which definitions for VAR and VALUE are being used by the other side of the connection. 2. Client Telnet: Parsing a SEND The SEND suboption should only contain VAR and USERVAR commands. It should never contain a VALUE. If while parsing a SEND suboption, a VALUE is encountered, the client should assume that the server has reversed values for VAR and VALUE, and from that point on the client should reverse those values, both in parsing the rest of the SEND suboption, and when generating an IS or INFO suboption. If both VALUE and VAR commands are encountered, the SEND command is not well formed, and it is implementation dependent as to what will happen. If there are not VAR or VALUE commands in the SEND suboption, then the client cannot know what values the server is expecting for VAR and VALUE. In this case, it should just assume that the server has the correct definitions, and use the correct values for VAR an...|$|E

30|$|From the {{numerical}} {{analyses of the}} model, we find that in the Philippine banking <b>environment,</b> <b>option</b> premiums exhibit sensitivity {{to changes in the}} Value of Waiting, variance, and information asymmetry. As there exists very little value for banks not to lend as evident in the ranges of Operating Income growth (which tend to deteriorate by idling), coupled with the competition to lend to more profitable clients, larger banks will place more value on the put option than their smaller counterparts. Effectively, larger banks will lend to projects with a Value of Waiting closer to zero (implying less risky borrowers), than smaller competitors. Empirical data shows the Value of Waiting is far more sensitive to the decisions of managers, as they affect returns from the loan portfolio. More stable returns from the loan portfolio will direct lending toward profitable clients in a particular industry. As information asymmetry increases, the value of the put option also grows. In turn, the value of the call option (the strategy of lending) diminishes.|$|E

40|$|With {{increased}} {{technology and}} economic opportunities, demand for energy and fuels {{in developing countries}} is growing exponentially to run processes and improve lifestyles, but rural areas may not have access. It is thus important to identify possible sources of energy for developing rural areas, especially those sources which are renewable and locally produced. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop a computer model to assess the viability of developing integrated biofuel production systems using biomass materials specific to Mozambique and India. The models considered various system capacities and production scenarios. Estimates of processing costs, along with other economic factors, were determined through techno-economic analysis, and environmental impacts were determined through life cycle assessment. Biofuel production on a farm scale was determined for a biodiesel, ethanol, and combined production system, with various capacities. Eighteen scenarios were created and tested. It was determined that larger capacities were more profitable per unit of biofuel, and the capacities exhibited economies of scale. A combined system has proven to increase profits, and production of 10 L/day, in a combined system is the most profitable of the India based scenarios. In Mozambique based scenarios, production of 10 L/day, in a combined system is the second most profitable option, with the biodiesel scenarios beating it by $ 0. 06 cents per year per liter of biofuel produced. Environmentally, the best scenarios are based in Mozambique because of the use of hydroelectric power instead of traditional coal powered electricity. The best <b>environment</b> <b>option</b> in India based scenarios is the 0. 125 L/hour (1 L/day) scenario, producing biodiesel. This system gives off only 10. 08 kg of CO 2 equivalent per year.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to collect data that would provide evidence as to what students' expectations of the environment were along with whether these expectations were actually being experienced by students living in the substance-free environment. A systematic sample of 139 students were surveyed who lived in the Students Uniting to Remain Free (SURF) substance-free living environment at Ball State University during the Fall semester of 2001 academic year. Data collection consisted of a survey instrument that had eight three-part questions, 10 demographic characteristic questions, and six student involvement questions. The data revealed that new and returning students living in the SURF hall were very satisfied with their residential experience. The majority of their expectations matched the majority of their experiences. Statistically significant differences between the expectations of new and returning students existed with the following variables: drinking and using drugs outside of the SURF hall, expecting that they would not have to deal with noise and disruptions caused by alcohol usage, living with students who had similar religious ideals and values, expecting the SURF hall to be a quiet study area and expecting and experiencing wellness and healthy lifestyle programs.

The current study examines and evaluates components {{thought to be a}} part of an enriched drop-in center experience that contribute to positive member outcomes through the effects of empowerment. These components include self-help, peer support, and creative expression. Outcomes were evaluated based on quality of life, self-worth, and symptom reduction. Such data are necessary in promoting the growth and development of drop-in centers and identification of components that contribute to positive member outcomes. Participants (n= 101) were administered a series of measures including The Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, The Empowerment Scale, The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, The World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF, The BASIS- 32 ™, and a series of questions created for the purposes of the current study regarding creative expression and self-help. The psychometric properties of each measure were evaluated and reviewed. Additionally, mean differences between normative data and participant means were examined and demographic data were analyzed. It was hypothesized from the literature that self-help, peer support, and creative expression would have significant indirect effects on all of the proposed outcome variables through the effects of empowerment. Results revealed significant indirect relationships between peer support and all of the outcome variables through the effects of empowerment and between self-help and all of the outcome variables through the effects of empowerment. No significant relationships were found between creative expression and any of the outcome variables through the effects of empowerment. These findings suggest that peer support and self-help may be instrumental in achieving positive outcomes through the effects of empowerment. Centers that offer experiences to enhance self-help and peer support will subsequently enhance feelings of empowerment in members, which relates to higher levels of self-worth, higher levels of quality of life, and lower levels of psychiatric symptomatology. Further implications of such findings and suggestions for continuation of this research are discussed in detail...|$|E

40|$|The neutron {{diffractometer}} BioDiff is a {{joint project}} of the Forschungszentrum Jülich (FZJ/JCNS) and the Forschungs-Neutronenquelle Heinz Maier-Leibnitz (FRM II). BioDiff is especially designed to collect data from crystals with large unit cells. The main field of application is the structure analysis of proteins, especially the determination of hydrogen atom positions. Typical scientific questions addressed are the determination of protonation states of amino acid side chains and the characterization of the hydrogen bonding network between the protein and an inhibitor or substrate. The orientation of water molecules in the active centre of the protein can also be determined. To first solve {{the structure of the}} protein using x-rays is a prerequisite for a successful experiment at BioDiff because we use the x-ray structure to solve the phase problem of crystallography. In some cases it is desirable to record the neutron data set at the same temperature as the x-ray data set. Especially this enables a joint neutron/x-ray refinement. Since the x-ray data at synchrotrons are often measured at cryogenic temperatures of 100 K we integrated a standard Oxford Cryosystems “Cryostream 700 Plus” as a new sample <b>environment</b> <b>option</b> to the instrument BioDiff (see Fig. 1 right). Recording data sets at low temperatures also facilitates measurements of frozen intermediate states of the protein or protein substrate complexes where the substrate is not digested by the protein due to the low mobility at cryogenic temperatures. The main advantage of the monochromatic instrument BioDiff is the possibility to adapt the wavelength between 2. 4 Å and 5. 6 Å to obtain a compromise between higher scattering yields at longer wavelengths and better resolution at smaller wavelengths. The main detector of BioDiff consists of a neutron imaging plate system in a cylindrical geometry in order to cover a large solid angle. A Li/ZnS scintillator imaged onto a CCD-chip is available for additional detection purposes (see Fig. 1, left). Applications of the BioDiff instrument as a powder diffractometer are also discussed...|$|E
