500|$|Betty Driver, who {{had been}} {{performing}} since she was 8 years old, retired from acting in her late forties to run hotels in Cheshire and Derbyshire. It was here that she was spotted by one of her customers, producer of Coronation Street, Harry Kershaw, who persuaded her to audition {{for the role of}} Hilda Ogden in 1964; she eventually had to turn the role down as she was tied into an advertising contract with Procter & Gamble and they refused to release her. The part of Hilda eventually went to Jean Alexander. Driver has commented, [...] "Harry Kershaw, producer of Coronation Street, persuaded me to audition for Hilda Ogden – just think I could have been wearing curlers for 30 years." [...] In 1969, she was cast as the new character, Betty Turpin. Commenting on her casting in 1999, Driver said, [...] " [...] said, 'Betty, <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> to pull pints for us on television?', and that was it. I suppose I expected I'd be there for perhaps a few months. But it just went on and on and, well, they've never managed to get rid of me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later {{during the}} 1980s, Rather gained further renown for his {{forceful}} and skeptical {{reporting on the}} Iran-Contra affair, which eventually led to an on-air confrontation with then Vice President George H. W. Bush: Bush referred to Rather's [...] "dead air incident" [...] saying, [...] "I {{want to talk about}} why I want to be President, why those 41 percent of the people are supporting me. And I don't think it's fair to judge my whole career by a rehash on Iran. <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> it if I judged your career by those seven minutes when you walked off the set in New York?" [...] Rather ignored Bush's comment.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1996, Stuart {{received}} a message about a film role: [...] "A female voice {{said she was}} calling from Lightstorm Entertainment...about a movie to be shot on location, maybe Poland...about the Titanic, directed by James Cameron..." [...] The next afternoon, Cameron’s casting director, Mali Finn, came to Stuart’s house [...] "…with her assistant, Emily Schweber, who was carrying a video camera... Mali and I talked while Emily filmed us." [...] The next morning, Finn brought over James Cameron and his video camera. Stuart wrote, [...] "I was {{not the least bit}} nervous. I knew I would read Old Rose with the sympathy and tenderness that Cameron had intended…" [...] Five days after Stuart's eighty-sixth birthday, Finn phoned again and asked, “Gloria, <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> to be Old Rose?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> have <b>liked</b> it, if <b>you</b> {{had been}} a Roman girl, and Moses were Quintus Curtius? <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> to have him give himself up {{for the good of}} the country?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I see <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{have made}} no patient Grizzle. And now, supposing fate had merely {{assigned}} you the lot of an old maid, what then? <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> have <b>liked</b> celibacy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My nieces will {{be obliged}} to abandon journalism, to be sure," [...] said Mr. Merrick; [...] "but I {{see no reason why}} the paper should suspend. <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> and Hetty <b>like</b> to remain in Millville and run it?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Responses to the {{restriction}} and ban of the Imouto Paradise! 2 manga were generally negative. The Comic Book Legal Defense Fund requested that Dan Kanemitsu, a blogger, and a Japanese-to-English translator {{who has worked}} on translating many anime, weigh in on the situation. Kanemitsu criticized the government, saying, [...] "We should always be careful when start to entrust the government with discriminatory polices, be that against people, sexuality, or mediums of self-expression. <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> it if someone told you homosexuality could be tolerated in only certain mediums, or that you may dance to waltz music but not to polka tunes?" [...] Kanemitsu concluded his interview, saying, [...] "If unchecked, the logic behind how Imouto Paradise 2 was designated harmful to minors can be employed by those in power to enforce their own brand of morality upon the public." ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 11, 1987, Rather {{walked off}} the set in anger just before a remote Evening News {{broadcast}} from Miami, where Pope John Paul II had begun a rare U.S. tour, when a U.S. Open tennis match was being broadcast into the time scheduled for the newscast. He was upset that the news was being cut into {{to make room for}} sports and discussed it with the sports department. The Steffi Graf–Lori McNeil tennis match coverage then ended sooner than expected at 6:32p.m., but Rather had disappeared. (CBS Sports had finally agreed to break away immediately after the match without commentary.) [...] Thus, over 100 affiliates were forced to broadcast six minutes of dead air. The next day, Rather apologized for leaving the anchor desk. The following year, when Rather asked then Vice President Bush about his role in the Iran–Contra affair during a live interview, Bush responded by saying, [...] "Dan, <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> it if I judged your entire career by those seven minutes when you {{walked off the}} set in New York?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, no," [...] said Gwendolen, indifferently, finding {{all places}} alike undescribable {{as soon as}} she {{imagined}} herself and her husband in them. [...] "I only wondered <b>how</b> long <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> this." ...|$|R
60|$|MY DEAREST AUGUSTA,--Let me {{know when}} you arrive, and when, and where, and <b>how,</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to see me,--any where in short but at dinner. I have put off going into ye country on purpose to waylay you.|$|R
30|$|Avatar Self-Discrepancy As a final measure, {{two items}} on a five-point Likert scale {{measured}} the avatar self-discrepancy (“How similar is your avatar to <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to be?”) and the avatar self-coherence (“How much is your avatar like you?”).|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well, Olaf, {{hold your}} noisy tongue," [...] said Gudrid, laughing, [...] "and come, tell me <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> {{to go to}} Vinland?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why don't {{her teeth}} come through, then," [...] {{retorted}} Johnny, {{in a loud}} rebellious voice, [...] "instead of bothering me? <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> it yourself?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{take the}} matter of children. <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> to become the father--and a mere glance around you will show you that the chances are {{enormously}} in favour {{of such a thing}} happening--of a boy with spectacles and protruding front teeth who asks questions all the time? Out of six small boys whom I saw when I came on board, four wore spectacles and had teeth like rabbits. The other two were equally revolting in different styles. <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> to become the father...?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{need not}} quite fix that. I was {{thinking}} of going to Naples for the winter." [...] He was silent, waiting for her approbation, but she expressed none. [...] "It is not long since you said <b>how</b> much <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to spend a winter in Naples." ...|$|R
5000|$|If {{you have}} been a victim of crime agree with <b>you</b> <b>how</b> often <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to be kept {{informed}} of progress in your case and for how long.

6000|$|... "Don't be so ridiculous, Tom! I'd rather stand a whole {{shower of}} red herrings' tails at once than bother Julius about his brother's wife. <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> and Terry <b>like</b> it, if your wives took to squabbling, and setting you {{together}} by the ears? I was demented enough to try it once, but I soon saw {{it was worse than}} anything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{why should}} you WANT to talk in that dreadful way? <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> to have people talk so about YOU, and you not cold yet?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see," [...] I said. [...] "You want {{big things}} that you can make your teeth meet in? <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> to breakfast on an elephant?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{how about}} it? You're out for adventure. <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> {{to work for}} me? All quite unofficial, you know. Expenses paid, and a {{moderate}} screw?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{but that}} don't comfort me any. I never was one {{to feel good}} because another man felt bad. <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> have <b>liked</b> it if some one had taken comfort because his boy lived when ours died? No, I can't do it. And this is worse than death, someways. That comes and it goes; but this {{looks as if it}} was one of those things that had come to stay. The way I look at it, there ain't any hope for anybody. Suppose we don't want Pen to have him; will that help Irene any, if he don't want her? Suppose we don't want to let him have either; does that help either!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Also known as, [...] "If you're nice, I'll be nice too." [...] This {{mechanism}} of reciprocity {{is similar to}} the heuristic of the golden rule, [...] "Treat others <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to be treated." [...] Parties mirror one another's attitudes, exchanging favors on the spot. Instant attitudinal reciprocity occurs among monkeys, and people often rely on it with strangers and acquaintances.|$|R
40|$|This paper aims at {{demonstrating a}} {{particular}} method to extract relevant information from navigation data. Participants had to perform web tasks while their navigation behavior was recorded. Then, {{they had to}} rate a list of presents based on the question: 2 ̆ 2 <b>how</b> much <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> to receive this present for your birthday? 2 ̆ 2 The semantic similarities (calculated with Latent Semantic Analysis) between users 2 ̆ 7 navigation paths and presents 2 ̆ 7 descriptions were used as implicit estimates of users 2 ̆ 7 preferences. Results show that users 2 ̆ 7 explicit preferences can be accurately estimated based on users 2 ̆ 7 navigation behavior. Consequently, we propose this method {{to be used in}} building user models for adaptive web applications...|$|R

6000|$|... 'I can't {{speak to}} you,' he murmured; 'you've hurt {{me so that}} I shall lie awake all night choking with this cough. If you had it you'd know what it was; but you'll be comfortably asleep while I'm in agony, and nobody near me. I wonder <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to pass those fearful nights!' And he began to wail aloud, for very pity of himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} as well for you to remember, Grandcourt, that you are coming under closer fire now. There can be none of the {{ordinary}} flirting done, which may mean everything or nothing.

6000|$|Bartley ventured {{upon this}} bold move, {{because he had}} {{found that it was}} always best to have things out with Marcia at once, and, {{if she was going to}} take his {{hospitality}} to Kinney in bad part, he wanted to get through the trouble.

[...] "My invitation rather slipped out, and I didn't know <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> it." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2001, Narkevičius {{represented}} Lithuania at the 49th Venice Bienniale. He also {{exhibited in}} the 50th, two years later, in the Utopia Station curated by Molly Nesbit and Hans Ulrich Obrist. Describing his works relationship with his nations past {{in an interview with}} Obrist, Narkevičius said that, “Memory is a funny thing. I think our brain has a filter: you remember what you want to remember. And you recreate the stories of the memory in a way that you want to remember them and <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to create them.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Gretta Duisenberg {{came under}} fire when she {{announced}} her intention of collecting six million signatures {{as part of her}} campaign {{to draw attention to the}} Israeli occupation of the Palestinian Territories. She was asked how many signatures she'd been able to gather for the petition against the occupation and replied that 6,000 supporters had signed so far. And <b>how</b> many signatures <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> to collect, she was asked. Duisenberg hesitated for a moment and then said, [...] "Six million". Critics stated that the figure was clearly an allusion to the number of Jewish victims of World War II. Duisenberg denied any link to the Holocaust, and stated that she just mentioned a multiple of the 6,000 they had already collected.|$|R
