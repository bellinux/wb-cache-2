5|$|Radishes can {{be useful}} as {{companion}} plants for many other crops, probably because their pungent odour deters such <b>insect</b> <b>pests</b> as aphids, cucumber beetles, tomato hornworms, squash bugs, and ants. They can function as a trap crop, luring <b>insect</b> <b>pests</b> away from the main crop. Cucumbers and radishes seem to thrive when grown in close association with each other, and radishes also grow well with chervil, lettuce, peas, and nasturtiums. However, they react adversely to growing in close association with hyssop.|$|E

Evaluating farmer's knowledge on <b>insect</b> <b>pest</b> and control useful to set research agenda, and to know the understanding of farmers about types of <b>insect</b> <b>pest</b> and how to control the <b>insect</b> <b>pest</b> in paddy field. The objectives {{of this study are}} to determine farmer's knowledge on <b>insect</b> <b>pest</b> and control in paddy field and to identify types of <b>insect</b> <b>pest</b> in paddy field. A semi structured survey on paddy, farmer's background, knowledge and control action were conducted on 30 March 2016. The background of the study was referred to the age, gender, experience handling paddy field, wages, area/acres, education level and activities practices in paddy field. Most of the farmers were range between (30 - 70) years old, and most of them were around age 50 and above. For education level the high percentage were (43. 1 %) of farmers that finished their study in secondary school with total of farmers were 25 of respondent and the low percentage were (3. 4 %) of farmers that finished their study in diploma/degree with total of farmers only 2 respondent. Most of the farmers (41. 4 %) have experience 10 years and above in managing paddy field. Even though their age were 50 and above, but their knowledge were still lack in to identification on different types of <b>insect</b> <b>pest.</b> Meanwhile, the highest severity of <b>insect</b> <b>pest</b> were golden apple snail and paddy bug. Farmers were still lacking on the knowledge of the <b>insect</b> <b>pest</b> and how to control based on the time table given by Department of Agriculture Merlimau. Training and short module need to be done to educate farmer 's knowledge on <b>insect</b> <b>pest</b> and control need to take into consideration for better management and decision making...|$|R
50|$|Numerous {{factors can}} {{possibly}} enhance the <b>insect</b> <b>pest</b> problem, this includes either manipulating {{the environment that}} are favorable for growth, reproduction and development of insects.

5|$|A {{number of}} <b>insect</b> <b>pests</b> infest stored dry {{foods such as}} flour, cereals and pasta; these include the Indian mealmoth, the {{cigarette}} beetle, the drugstore beetle, the confused flour beetle, the red flour beetle, the merchant grain beetle, the sawtoothed grain beetle, the wheat weevil, the maize weevil and the rice weevil.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria {{used for}} {{biological}} control infect insects via their digestive tracts, so they offer only limited options for controlling insects with sucking mouth parts such as aphids and scale insects. Bacillus thuringiensis {{is the most}} widely applied species of bacteria used for biological control, with at least four sub-species used against Lepidopteran (moth, butterfly), Coleopteran (beetle) and Dipteran (true fly) <b>insect</b> <b>pests.</b> The bacterium is available to organic farmers in sachets of dried spores which are mixed with water and sprayed onto vulnerable plants such as brassicas and fruit trees. Genes from B. thuringiensis have also been incorporated into transgenic crops, making the plants express some of the bacterium's toxins, which are proteins. These confer resistance to <b>insect</b> <b>pests</b> and thus reduce the necessity for pesticide use. If pests develop resistance to the toxins in these crops, B. thuringiensis will become useless in organic farming also.|$|E
5|$|Like most crows, {{they will}} {{scavenge}} at landfills, scattering garbage in the process. Where available, corn, wheat {{and other crops}} are a favorite food. These habits have historically caused the American crow {{to be considered a}} nuisance.

40|$|The {{banana weevil}} Cosmopolites sordidus is an {{important}} and serious <b>insect</b> <b>pest</b> in most banana and plantain-growing areas of the world. In spite of the economic importance of this <b>insect</b> <b>pest</b> very little genomic and transcriptomic information exists for this species. In the present study, we characterized the midgut transcriptome of C. sordidus using massive 454 -pyrosequencing. We generated over 590, 000 sequencing reads that assembled into 30, 840 contigs with more than 400 bp, representing a significant expansion of existing sequences available for this <b>insect</b> <b>pest.</b> Among them, 16, 427 contigs contained one or more GO terms. In addition, 15, 263 contigs were assigned an EC number. In-depth transcriptome analysis identified genes potentially involved in insecticide resistance, peritrophic membrane biosynthesis, immunity-related function and defense against pathogens, and Bacillus thuringiensis toxins binding proteins as well as multiple enzymes involved with protein digestion. This transcriptome will provide a valuable resource for understanding larval physiology and for identifying novel target sites and management approaches for this important <b>insect</b> <b>pest...</b>|$|R
5|$|Apple {{trees are}} {{susceptible}} {{to a number of}} fungal and bacterial diseases and <b>insect</b> <b>pests.</b> Many commercial orchards pursue a program of chemical sprays to maintain high fruit quality, tree health, and high yields. A trend in orchard management is the use of organic methods. These prohibit the use of synthetic pesticides, though some older pesticides are allowed. Organic methods include, for instance, introducing its natural predator to reduce the population of a particular pest.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Needham noted a Chinese text {{dating from}} 304 AD, Records of the Plants and Trees of the Southern Regions, by Hsi Han, which {{describes}} mandarin oranges protected by large reddish-yellow citrus ants which attack and kill <b>insect</b> <b>pests</b> {{of the orange}} trees.

5|$|Aside {{from some}} papers {{published}} discussing myrmecophilous beetles and <b>insect</b> <b>pests</b> in forests, Clark predominately researched and published {{articles about the}} taxonomy of Australian ants. All of his articles and monographs were published in Australia. Throughout his career, Clark described around 200 different species of ants, but half of these may be synonyms. He worked and researched {{with all of the}} main groups of Australian ants, but his research and revisionary efforts were extensive with members of the former subfamily Cerapachyinae (now Dorylinae), especially those of Phyracaces, the Myrmeciinae, Rhytidoponera and members of the tribe Dolichoderini.|$|E
5|$|The {{blackcurrant}} leaf midge {{can cause}} browning, crimping and distortion of leaves at {{the tips of}} shoots but it is seldom a serious problem. The blackcurrant sawfly (Nematus ribesii) lays its eggs {{on the underside of}} the leaves and the voracious larvae work their way along the shoots, stripping off leaf after leaf. In a serious attack, the bush can be denuded of leaves. Larvae of the currant borer drill their way along the centres of shoots, which wilt and die back. Other <b>insect</b> <b>pests</b> include scale insects, aphids and earwigs.|$|E
5|$|The egg {{parasite}} Trichogramma {{is frequently}} released inundatively to control harmful moths. Similarly, Bacillus thuringiensis and other microbial insecticides {{are used in}} large enough quantities for a rapid effect. Recommended release rates for Trichogramma in vegetable or field crops range from 5,000 to 200,000 per acre (1 to 50 per square metre) per week according {{to the level of}} pest infestation. Similarly, nematodes that kill insects (that are entomopathogenic) are released at rates of millions and even billions per acre for control of certain soil-dwelling <b>insect</b> <b>pests.</b>|$|E

40|$|The EPA (U. S. Environmental Protection Agency) is tasked {{to monitor}} for <b>insect</b> <b>pest</b> {{resistance}} to transgenic crops. Several {{models have been}} developed to understand the resistance properties of insects. The Population Genetics Simulator model is used in the EPA PIRDSS (Pest Infestation and Resistance Decision Support System). The EPA Office of Pesticide Programs uses the DSS to help understand the potential for <b>insect</b> <b>pest</b> resistance development and the likelihood that <b>insect</b> <b>pest</b> resistance will negatively affect transgenic corn. Once the DSS identifies areas of concern, crews are deployed to collect <b>insect</b> <b>pest</b> samples, which are tested to identify whether they have developed resistance to the toxins in transgenic corn pesticides. In this candidate solution, VIIRS (Visible/Infrared Imager/Radiometer Suite) vegetation index products will be used to build hypertemporal layerstacks for crop type and phenology assessment.

5|$|Aloe vera {{has been}} widely grown as an {{ornamental}} plant. The species is popular with modern gardeners as a putatively medicinal plant and for its interesting flowers, form, and succulence. This succulence enables the species to survive in areas of low natural rainfall, making it ideal for rockeries and other low water-use gardens. The species is hardy in zones 8–11, and is intolerant of heavy frost and snow. The species is relatively resistant to most <b>insect</b> <b>pests,</b> though spider mites, mealy bugs, scale insects, and aphid species may cause a decline in plant health. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.|$|E

5|$|Beetles are {{prominent}} in human culture, from the sacred scarabs of ancient Egypt to beetlewing art and use as pets or fighting insects for entertainment and gambling. Many beetle groups are brightly and attractively coloured making them objects of collection and decorative displays. Over 300 species {{are used as}} food, mostly as larvae; species widely consumed include mealworms and rhinoceros beetle larvae. However, the major impact of beetles on human life is as agricultural, forestry, and horticultural pests. Serious pests include the boll weevil of cotton, the Colorado potato beetle, the coconut hispine beetle, and the mountain pine beetle. Most beetles, however, do not cause economic damage and many, such as the lady beetles and dung beetles are beneficial by helping to control <b>insect</b> <b>pests.</b>|$|E
5|$|Entomopathogenic fungi, {{which cause}} disease in insects, {{include at least}} 14 species that attack aphids.

Lecanicillium spp. are deployed against white flies, thrips and aphids. Metarhizium spp. are used against pests including beetles, locusts and other grasshoppers, Hemiptera, and spider mites. Paecilomyces fumosoroseus is effective against white flies, thrips and aphids; Purpureocillium lilacinus is used against root-knot nematodes, and 89 Trichoderma species against certain plant pathogens. Trichoderma viride has been used against Dutch elm disease, and has shown some effect in suppressing silver leaf, a disease of stone fruits caused by the pathogenic fungus Chondrostereum purpureum.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{this family}} are chiefly known for their {{characteristic}} behaviour; they mostly forage for insect prey on the trunks and branches of trees, and often communicate by drumming with their beak, producing a reverberatory sound that can be heard at some distance. Some species vary their diet with fruits, bird's eggs and small animals, and some suck sap. They mostly nest and roost in holes that they excavate in tree trunks, and their abandoned holes are of importance to other cavity-nesting birds. They sometimes come into conflict with man when they make holes in buildings or feed on fruit crops, but perform a useful service by their removal of <b>insect</b> <b>pests</b> on trees.|$|E
